<text>Black Sabbath are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1968 by guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward, bassist Geezer Butler, and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. They are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with their first three albums &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, &quot;Paranoid&quot; (both 1970), and &quot;Master of Reality&quot; (1971). Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the band underwent multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history, though since 1997 it has settled with the original band except for Ward on occasions.

After previous iterations of the group – the Polka Tulk Blues Band, and Earth – the band settled on the name Black Sabbath in 1969. They distinguished themselves through occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and down-tuned guitars. Signing to Philips Records in November 1969, they released their first single, a cover of the Crow song &quot;Evil Woman&quot;, in January 1970, and their debut album, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, was released the following month. Though it received a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success, leading to a follow-up record, &quot;Paranoid&quot;, later that year. The band&#x27;s popularity grew, and by 1973&#x27;s &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, critics were starting to respond favourably. This album, along with its predecessor &quot;Vol. 4&quot; (1972) and its successors &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1975), &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; (1976) and &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; (1978), saw the band explore more experimental and progressive styles.

Osbourne first left Black Sabbath in late 1977 and was briefly replaced by Dave Walker. After returning to record &quot;Never Say Die!&quot;, Osbourne was dismissed from the band a second time in 1979 due to his substance abuse, and was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who recorded three albums with the band: &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1980), &quot;Mob Rules&quot; (1981) and their first authorised live album &quot;Live Evil&quot; (1983), the last two featuring drummer Vinny Appice replacing Ward. Following Dio and Appice&#x27;s departures, Iommi and Butler recorded &quot;Born Again&quot; (1983) with then-former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan and Ward returning on drums, while the latter was replaced by then-Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan on the subsequent tour. Black Sabbath split in 1984, with Iommi assembling a new version of the band the following year. For the next twelve years, the band endured many personnel changes that included vocalists Glenn Hughes (who appeared on 1986&#x27;s &quot;Seventh Star&quot;), Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers (including Cozy Powell) and bassists; of the vocalists during these years, Martin&#x27;s tenure was the longest, joining the band in 1987 and recording three studio albums before his initial departure in 1991: &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot; (1987), &quot;Headless Cross&quot; (1989), and &quot;Tyr&quot; (1990). That same year, Iommi reunited with Butler, Dio and Appice to record &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; (1992), though Dio and Appice had both departed again by the end of 1992. Martin returned as vocalist for two more studio albums, &quot;Cross Purposes&quot; (1994) and &quot;Forbidden&quot; (1995), and one live album before the band went on a one-year hiatus during 1996.

The original line-up of Iommi, Osbourne, Butler and Ward reunited in 1997, releasing a live album, &quot;Reunion&quot;, in the following year, and continuing to tour sporadically until 2005, most of which saw Black Sabbath headline Osbourne&#x27;s annual festival tour Ozzfest. The band went on another hiatus in 2006 when the &quot;Mob Rules&quot; line-up reunited as Heaven &amp; Hell, touring during the late 2000s and releasing its sole studio album, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, in 2009 before disbanding after Dio&#x27;s death in the following year. The original line-up of Black Sabbath reunited once again in 2011, though Ward departed prior to the recording of their final studio album and 19th overall, &quot;13&quot; (2013). To conclude their farewell tour, Black Sabbath played its last concert for eight years in their home city on 4 February 2017. Occasional partial reunions had occurred since, most notably when Osbourne and Iommi performed together at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. The original line-up of Black Sabbath will reunite for what is planned to be a final show for both the band and Osbourne as a solo musician, titled Back to the Beginning, at Villa Park on 5 July 2025.

Black Sabbath have sold over 70 million records worldwide as of 2013, making them one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands. Black Sabbath, together with Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, have been referred to as the &quot;unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies&quot;. They were ranked by MTV as the &quot;Greatest Metal Band of All Time&quot; and placed second on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; list. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked them number 85 on its &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance, and in 2019, the band received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

==History==
===1968–1969: Formation and early days===
Following the break-up of their previous band, Mythology, in 1968, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward sought to form a heavy blues rock band in Aston, Birmingham. They enlisted bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, who had played together in a band called Rare Breed, Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop: &quot;OZZY ZIG Needs Gig – has own PA&quot;. The new group was initially named the Polka Tulk Blues Band, the name taken either from a brand of talcum powder or an Indian/Pakistani clothing shop; the exact origin is confused. The Polka Tulk Blues Band included slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips, a childhood friend of Osbourne&#x27;s, and saxophonist Alan &quot;Aker&quot; Clarke. After shortening the name to Polka Tulk, the band again changed their name to Earth (which Osbourne hated) and continued as a four-piece without Phillips and Clarke. Iommi became concerned that Phillips and Clarke lacked the necessary dedication and were not taking the band seriously. Rather than asking them to leave, they instead decided to break up and then quietly reformed the band as a four-piece. While the band was performing under the Earth moniker, they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as &quot;The Rebel&quot;, &quot;When I Came Down&quot; and &quot;Song for Jim&quot;, the latter of which being a reference to Jim Simpson, who was a manager for the bands Bakerloo Blues Line and Tea &amp; Symphony, as well as the trumpet player for the group Locomotive. Simpson had recently started a new club named Henry&#x27;s Blueshouse at The Crown Hotel in Birmingham and offered to let Earth play there after they agreed to waive the usual support band fee in return for free T-shirts. The audience response was positive and Simpson agreed to manage Earth.

In December 1968, Iommi abruptly left Earth to join Jethro Tull. Although his stint with the band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth by the end of the month. &quot;It just wasn&#x27;t right, so I left&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn&#x27;t much go for having a leader in the band, which was Ian Anderson&#x27;s way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it.&quot;

While playing shows in England in 1969, the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth, so they decided to change their name again (this name change would give rise to the well-known debate about the alleged aesthetic influence of Coven, which the British band always denied). A cinema across the street from the band&#x27;s rehearsal room was showing the 1963 Italian horror film &quot;Black Sabbath,&quot; starring Boris Karloff and directed by Mario Bava. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was &quot;strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies&quot;. Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer Dennis Wheatley, along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed. Making use of the musical tritone, also known as &quot;the Devil&#x27;s Interval&quot;, the song&#x27;s ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music and hippie culture. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track &quot;probably the most evil song ever written&quot;. Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films.

===1969–1971: &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot;===
The band&#x27;s first show as Black Sabbath took place on 30 August 1969 in Workington, England. They were signed to Philips Records in November 1969. They recorded their first single, &quot;Evil Woman&quot; (a cover of a song by the band Crow), at Trident Studios. &quot;Evil Woman&quot; was released on 9 January 1970 through Philips subsidiary Fontana Records. Later releases were handled by Philips&#x27; newly formed progressive rock label, Vertigo Records. &quot;Evil Woman&quot; failed to chart.

The band were afforded two days of studio time in November 1969 to record their debut album with producer Rodger Bain. Iommi recalls recording live: &quot;We thought, &#x27;We have two days to do it, and one of the days is mixing.&#x27; So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time; we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff&quot;.

On 11 November 1969 Black Sabbath recorded a 4-song session for John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; radio show. The four songs were &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, &quot;N.I.B.&quot;, &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Village&quot;. Broadcast on 29 November 1969, this gave them their first exposure to a UK wide audience.
Their debut album &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was released on Friday the 13th, February 1970, and reached number eight in the UK Albums Chart. Following its U.S. and Canadian release in May 1970 by Warner Bros. Records, the album reached number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it remained for over a year. The album was given negative reviews by many critics. Lester Bangs dismissed it in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review as &quot;discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like velocitised speedfreaks all over each other&#x27;s musical perimeters, yet never quite finding synch&quot;. It sold in substantial numbers despite being panned, giving the band their first mainstream exposure. It has since been certified Platinum in both U.S. by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and in the UK by British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and is now generally accepted as the first heavy metal album.

The band returned to the studio in June 1970, just four months after &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was released. The new album was initially set to be named &quot;War Pigs&quot; after the song &quot;War Pigs&quot;, which was critical of the Vietnam War; however, Warner changed the title of the album to &quot;Paranoid&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Paranoid&quot;, was written in the studio at the last minute. Ward explains: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the [Paranoid] guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.&quot; The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, remaining Black Sabbath&#x27;s only top 10 hit. The album followed in the UK in October 1970, where, pushed by the success of the &quot;Paranoid&quot; single, it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart.

The U.S. release was held off until January 1971, as the &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; album was still on the chart at the time of &quot;Paranoid&quot;″s UK release. The album reached No. 12 in the U.S. in March 1971, and would go on to sell four million copies in the U.S. with virtually no radio airplay. Like &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, the album was panned by rock critics of the era, but modern-day reviewers such as AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey cite &quot;Paranoid&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time&quot;, which &quot;defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history&quot;. The album was ranked at number 131 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Paranoid&quot;″s chart success allowed the band to tour the U.S. for the first time – their first U.S. show was at a club called Ungano&#x27;s at 210 West 70th Street in New York City – and spawned the release of the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Although the single failed to reach the top 40, it remains one of Black Sabbath&#x27;s most popular songs, as well as the band&#x27;s highest-charting U.S. single until 1998&#x27;s &quot;Psycho Man&quot;.

===1971–1973: &quot;Master of Reality&quot; and &quot;Vol. 4&quot;===
In February 1971, after a one-off performance at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of &quot;Paranoid&quot;, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a &quot;briefcase full of cash&quot; to buy drugs. &quot;We were getting into coke, big time&quot;, Ward explained. &quot;Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like. It got to the stage where you come up with ideas and forget them, because you were just so out of it.&quot;

Production completed in April 1971, and in July the band released &quot;Master of Reality&quot;, just six months after the U.S. release of &quot;Paranoid&quot;. The album reached the top 10 in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, and was certified Gold in less than two months, eventually receiving Platinum certification in the 1980s and Double Platinum in the early 21st century. It contained Sabbath&#x27;s first acoustic songs, alongside fan favourites such as &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; and &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot;. Critical response of the era was generally unfavourable, with Lester Bangs delivering an ambivalent review of &quot;Master of Reality&quot; in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, describing the closing &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; as &quot;naïve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel – but in the tradition [of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll] ... The only criterion is excitement, and Black Sabbath&#x27;s got it&quot;. (In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would place the album at number 300 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.)

Following the &quot;Master of Reality&quot; world tour in 1972, the band took their first break in three years. As Ward explained: &quot;The band started to become very fatigued and very tired. We&#x27;d been on the road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think &quot;Master of Reality&quot; was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album.&quot;

In June 1972, the band reconvened in Los Angeles to begin work on their next album at the Record Plant. With more time in the studio, the album saw the band experimenting with new textures, such as strings, piano, orchestration and multi-part songs. Recording was plagued with problems, many as a result of substance abuse issues. Struggling to record the song &quot;Cornucopia&quot; after &quot;sitting in the middle of the room, just doing drugs&quot;, Ward was nearly fired. &quot;I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just ... horrible,&quot; the drummer said. &quot;I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like, &#x27;Well, just go home; you&#x27;re not being of any use right now.&#x27; I felt like I&#x27;d blown it, I was about to get fired&quot;. Butler thought that the end product &quot;was very badly produced, as far as I was concerned. Our then-manager insisted on producing it, so he could claim production costs&quot;.

The album was originally titled &quot;Snowblind&quot; after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to &quot;Black Sabbath Vol. 4&quot;. Ward observed, &quot;There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it&#x27;s a pretty stupid title, really&quot;. &quot;Vol. 4&quot; was released in September 1972, and while critics were dismissive, it achieved Gold status in less than a month, and was the band&#x27;s fourth consecutive release to sell a million in the U.S. &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Dream&quot; was released as a single – the band&#x27;s first since &quot;Paranoid&quot; – but failed to chart.

Following an extensive tour of the U.S., in 1973 the band travelled again to Australia, followed by a tour for the first time to New Zealand, before moving onto mainland Europe. &quot;The band were definitely in their heyday&quot;, recalled Ward, &quot;in the sense that nobody had burnt out quite yet&quot;.

===1973–1976: &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; and &quot;Sabotage&quot;===

Following the &quot;Vol. 4&quot; world tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles to begin work on their next release. Pleased with the &quot;Vol. 4&quot; album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a &quot;giant synthesiser&quot;. The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. &quot;Ideas weren&#x27;t coming out the way they were on &quot;Vol. 4&quot;, and we really got discontent&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn&#x27;t think of anything. And if I didn&#x27;t come up with anything, nobody would do anything&quot;.

After a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to England. They rented Clearwell Castle in The Forest of Dean. &quot;We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy, but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things and stuff started coming out again&quot;. While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, which set the tone for the new material. Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on &quot;Vol. 4&quot;, new songs incorporated synthesisers, strings and complex arrangements. Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman was brought in as a session player, appearing on &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot;.

In November 1973, Black Sabbath began to receive positive reviews in the mainstream press after the release of &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, with Gordon Fletcher of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling the album &quot;an extraordinarily gripping affair&quot; and &quot;nothing less than a complete success&quot;. Later reviewers such as AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as a &quot;masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection&quot;, while also displaying &quot;a newfound sense of finesse and maturity&quot;. The album marked the band&#x27;s fifth consecutive Platinum-selling album in the U.S., reaching number four on the UK Albums Chart and number 11 in the U.S.

The band began a world tour in January 1974, which culminated at the California Jam festival in Ontario, California, on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 200,000 fans, Black Sabbath appeared alongside popular 1970s rock and pop bands Deep Purple, Eagles, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Rare Earth, Seals &amp; Crofts, Black Oak Arkansas and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the U.S., exposing the band to a wider American audience. In the same year, the band shifted management, signing with notorious English manager Don Arden. The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath&#x27;s former management, and while on stage in the U.S., Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation.

Black Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&quot;. &quot;We could&#x27;ve continued and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn&#x27;t particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album – &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&quot; wasn&#x27;t a rock album, really&quot;. Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, &quot;Sabotage&quot; was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stating &quot;&quot;Sabotage&quot; is not only Black Sabbath&#x27;s best record since &quot;Paranoid&quot;, it might be their best ever&quot;, although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that &quot;the magical chemistry that made such albums as &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Volume 4&quot; so special was beginning to disintegrate&quot;.

&quot;Sabotage&quot; reached the top 20 in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but was the band&#x27;s first release not to achieve Platinum status in the U.S., only achieving Gold certification. Although the album&#x27;s only single &quot;Am I Going Insane (Radio)&quot; failed to chart, &quot;Sabotage&quot; features fan favourites such as &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot;. Black Sabbath toured in support of &quot;Sabotage&quot; with openers Kiss, but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975, following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back. In December 1975, the band&#x27;s record companies released a greatest hits album without input from the band, titled &quot;We Sold Our Soul for Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. The album charted throughout 1976, eventually selling two million copies in the U.S.

===1976–1979: &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;Never Say Die!&quot;, and Osbourne&#x27;s departure===

Black Sabbath began work for their next album at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, in June 1976. To expand their sound, the band added keyboard player Gerald Woodroffe, who also had appeared to a lesser extent on &quot;Sabotage&quot;. During the recording of &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;, Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians. Recording of &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; was difficult; by the time the album was completed, Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain. It was released on 25 September 1976 to mixed reviews, and – for the first time – later music critics gave the album less favourable retrospective reviews; two decades after its release, AllMusic gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was &quot;unravelling at an alarming rate&quot;. The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; failed to reach the top 50 in the U.S. and was the band&#x27;s second consecutive release not to achieve Platinum status, although it was later certified Gold in 1997. The album included &quot;Dirty Women&quot;, which remains a live staple, as well as Ward&#x27;s first lead vocal on the song &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;. Touring in support of &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; began in November 1976, with openers Boston and Ted Nugent in the U.S., and completed in Europe with AC/DC in April 1977.

In late 1977, while in rehearsal for their next album and just days before the band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker, a longtime friend of the band who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band. Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath. On 8 January 1978, Walker made his only live performance with Black Sabbath, on vocals, when they played an early version of the song &quot;Junior&#x27;s Eyes&quot; on the BBC Television programme &quot;Look! Hear!&quot; Walker later recalled that, while in Birmingham, he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and came to the conclusion that Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath. &quot;The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me&quot;, Osbourne said. &quot;I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out.&quot; Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band, but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the &quot;Look! Hear!&quot; footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them.

Osbourne initially set out to form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. &quot;Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band&quot;, Iommi explained. &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t sing any of the stuff we&#x27;d written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We&#x27;d write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn&#x27;t get time to reflect on stuff. &#x27;Is this right? Is this working properly?&#x27; It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick&quot;.

The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, writing and recording what would become &quot;Never Say Die!&quot;. &quot;It took quite a long time&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We&#x27;d go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we&#x27;d have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody&#x27;s playing a different thing. We&#x27;d go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day&quot;. The album was released in September 1978, reaching number 12 in the United Kingdom and number 69 in the U.S. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time, with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album&#x27;s &quot;unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band&#x27;s tense personnel problems and drug abuse&quot;. The album featured the singles &quot;Never Say Die&quot; and &quot;Hard Road&quot;, both of which cracked the top 40 in the United Kingdom. The band also made their second appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, performing &quot;Never Say Die&quot;. It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the U.S.

Touring in support of &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; began in May 1978 with openers Van Halen. Reviewers called Black Sabbath&#x27;s performance &quot;tired and uninspired&quot;, a stark contrast to the &quot;youthful&quot; performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time. The band filmed a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as &quot;Never Say Die&quot;. The final show of the tour – and Osbourne&#x27;s last appearance with the band until later reunions – was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 11 December.

Following the tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne &quot;was on a totally different level altogether&quot;. The band would come up with new song ideas, but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne&#x27;s lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. &quot;At that time, Ozzy had come to an end&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like, &#x27;Rehearse today? No, we&#x27;ll do it tomorrow.&#x27; It really got so bad that we didn&#x27;t do anything. It just fizzled out&quot;. Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Iommi to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979. &quot;I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I&#x27;m drunk I am horrible, I am horrid&quot;, Ward said. &quot;Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic&quot;.

===1979–1982: Dio joins, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; and &quot;Mob Rules&quot;===

While Don Arden was trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin Black Sabbath, as he viewed the original line-up as the most profitable, the band hired former Rainbow frontman Ronnie James Dio as Osbourne&#x27;s replacement, and they began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne&#x27;s, Dio&#x27;s addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath&#x27;s sound. &quot;They were totally different altogether&quot;, Iommi explains. &quot;Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing &quot;across&quot; the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing.&quot;

Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979 to deal with the divorce from his first wife. According to Dio, the band initially hired Craig Gruber, with whom Dio had previously played while in Elf and Rainbow, on bass to assist with writing the new album. Gruber was soon replaced by Geoff Nicholls of Quartz. The new line-up returned to Criteria Studios in November to begin recording work, with Butler returning to the band in January 1980 and Nicholls moving to keyboards. Produced by Martin Birch, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; was released on 25 April 1980, to critical acclaim. Over a decade after its release, AllMusic said the album was &quot;one of Sabbath&#x27;s finest records, the band sounds reborn and re-energised throughout&quot;. &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; peaked at number nine in the United Kingdom and number 28 in the U.S., the band&#x27;s highest-charting album since &quot;Sabotage&quot;. The album eventually sold a million copies in the U.S., and the band embarked on an extensive world tour, making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980.

Black Sabbath toured the U.S. throughout 1980 with Blue Öyster Cult on the &quot;Black and Blue&quot; tour, with a show at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, filmed for Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert and later released theatrically in 1981 as &quot;Black and Blue&quot;. On 26 July 1980, the band played to 75,000 fans at a sold-out Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with Journey, Cheap Trick and Molly Hatchet. The next day, the band appeared at the 1980 Day on the Green at Oakland Coliseum. While on tour, Black Sabbath&#x27;s former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven-year-old performance, titled &quot;Live at Last&quot; without any input from the band. The album reached number five on the UK chart and saw the re-release of &quot;Paranoid&quot; as a single, which reached the top 20.

On 18 August 1980, after a show in Bloomington, Minnesota, Ward quit the band. &quot;It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated&quot;. Butler stated that after Ward&#x27;s final show, the drummer came in drunk, stating that &quot;he might as well be a Martian&quot;. Ward then got angry, packed his things and got on a bus to leave. Following Ward&#x27;s sudden departure, the group hired drummer Vinny Appice. Further trouble for the band came during their 9 October 1980 concert at the Milwaukee Arena, which degenerated into a riot that caused $10,000 in damages to the arena and resulted in 160 arrests. According to the Associated Press: &quot;The crowd of mostly adolescent males first became rowdy in a performance by the Blue Oyster Cult&quot; and then grew restless while waiting an hour for Black Sabbath to begin playing. A member of the audience threw a beer bottle that struck Butler and effectively ended the show. &quot;The band then abruptly halted its performance and began leaving&quot; as the crowd rioted.

The band completed the &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; world tour in February 1981 and returned to the studio to begin work on their next album. Black Sabbath&#x27;s second studio album that was produced by Martin Birch and featured Ronnie James Dio as vocalist, &quot;Mob Rules&quot;, was released in October 1981 and was well received by fans, but less so by critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer J. D. Considine gave the album one star, claiming &quot;&quot;Mob Rules&quot; finds the band as dull-witted and flatulent as ever&quot;. Like most of the band&#x27;s earlier work, time helped to improve the opinions of the music press. A decade after its release, AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia called &quot;Mob Rules&quot; &quot;a magnificent record&quot;. The album was certified Gold and reached the top 20 on the UK chart. The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;The Mob Rules&quot;, which was recorded at John Lennon&#x27;s old house in England, was also featured in the 1981 animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, although the film version is an alternate take and differs from the album version.

Unhappy with the quality of 1980&#x27;s &quot;Live at Last&quot;, the band recorded another live album – titled &quot;Live Evil –&quot; during the &quot;Mob Rules&quot; world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling-out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album&#x27;s mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. &quot;Ronnie wanted more say in things&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. &quot;Live Evil&quot; is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn&#x27;t know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, &#x27;That&#x27;s it, the band is over&#x27;&quot;. &quot;When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they&#x27;re not as good as me, so I do what I want to do&quot;, Dio later said. &quot;I refuse to listen to &quot;Live Evil&quot;, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny&quot;.

Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start his own band and took drummer Vinny Appice with him. &quot;Live Evil&quot; was released in January 1983, but was overshadowed by Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s Platinum-selling album &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;.

===1982–1984: Gillan as singer and &quot;Born Again&quot;===

The remaining original members, Iommi and Butler, began auditioning singers for the band&#x27;s next release. Deep Purple and Whitesnake&#x27;s David Coverdale, Samson&#x27;s Nicky Moore and Lone Star&#x27;s John Sloman were all considered, and Iommi states in his autobiography that Michael Bolton auditioned, though this claim has been disputed, with Butler suggesting that Iommi concocted the story as &quot;a joke&quot; and Bolton insisting it was &quot;only a rumour&quot;. The band settled on then-former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to replace Dio in December 1982. The project was initially not to be called Black Sabbath, but pressure from the record label forced the group to retain the name. The band entered The Manor Studios in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober Bill Ward on drums. &quot;That was the very first album that I ever did clean and sober,&quot; Ward recalled. &quot;I only got drunk &quot;after&quot; I finished all my work on the album – which wasn&#x27;t a very good idea... Sixty to seventy per cent of my energy was taken up on learning how to get through the day without taking a drink and learning how to do things without drinking, and thirty per cent of me was involved in the album.&quot;

&quot;Born Again&quot; (9 September 1983) was panned on release by critics. Despite this negative reception, it reached number four in the UK, and number 39 in the U.S. Even three decades after its release, AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia called the album &quot;dreadful&quot;, noting that &quot;Gillan&#x27;s bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom&quot;.

Unable to tour because of the pressures of the road, Ward quit the band. &quot;I fell apart with the idea of touring,&quot; he later explained. &quot;I got so much fear behind touring, I didn&#x27;t talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake.&quot; He was replaced by former Move and Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the &quot;Born Again&quot; &#x27;83–&#x27;84 world tour, (often unofficially referred to as the &#x27;Feighn Death Sabbath &#x27;83–&#x27;84&#x27; World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the U.S. with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger. The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival in England, adding Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; to their encore.

The tour in support of &quot;Born Again&quot; included a giant set of the Stonehenge monument. In a move later parodied in the mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece. Butler explained:

===1984–1987: Hiatus, Hughes as singer, &quot;Seventh Star&quot;, and Gillen as singer===
Following the completion of the &quot;Born Again&quot; tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like &quot;hired help&quot; by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato and Ward once again rejoined the band. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band&#x27;s revolving line-up, Ward left shortly after stating &quot;This isn&#x27;t Black Sabbath&quot;. Butler would quit Sabbath next in November 1984 to form a solo band. &quot;When Ian Gillan took over that was the end of it for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn&#x27;t have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it.&quot;

One vocalist whose status is disputed, both inside and outside Sabbath, is Christian evangelist and former Joshua frontman Jeff Fenholt. Fenholt insists he was a singer in Sabbath between January and May 1985. Iommi has never confirmed this. Fenholt gives a detailed account in Garry Sharpe-Young&#x27;s book &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath&quot;.

Following both Ward&#x27;s and Butler&#x27;s exits, sole remaining original member Iommi put Sabbath on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. While working on new material, the original Sabbath line-up agreed to a spot at Bob Geldof&#x27;s Live Aid, performing at the Philadelphia show on 13 July 1985. This event – which also featured reunions of The Who and Led Zeppelin – marked the first time the original line-up had appeared on stage since 1978. &quot;We were all drunk when we did Live Aid,&quot; recalled Geezer Butler, &quot;but we&#x27;d all got drunk separately.&quot;

Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist Dave Spitz (ex-Great White), drummer Eric Singer and initially intended to use multiple singers, including Rob Halford of Judas Priest, former Deep Purple and Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio. This plan did not work as he forecasted. &quot;We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album.&quot;
The band spent the remainder of the year in the studio, recording what would become &quot;Seventh Star&quot; (1986). Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band&#x27;s manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as &quot;Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi&quot; in January 1986. &quot;It opened up a whole can of worms,&quot; Iommi explained. &quot;If we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more.&quot; &quot;Seventh Star&quot; sounded little like a Sabbath album, incorporating instead elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene. It was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as AllMusic gave album verdicts, calling the album &quot;often misunderstood and underrated&quot;.

The new line-up rehearsed for six weeks preparing for a full world tour, although the band were eventually forced to use the Sabbath name. &quot;I was into the &#x27;Tony Iommi project&#x27;, but I wasn&#x27;t into the Black Sabbath moniker,&quot; Hughes said. &quot;The idea of being in Black Sabbath didn&#x27;t appeal to me &quot;whatsoever&quot;. Glenn Hughes singing in Black Sabbath is like James Brown singing in Metallica. It wasn&#x27;t gonna work.&quot; Just four days before the start of the tour, Hughes got into a bar fight with the band&#x27;s production manager John Downing which splintered the singer&#x27;s orbital bone. The injury interfered with Hughes&#x27; ability to sing, and the band brought in vocalist Ray Gillen to continue the tour with W.A.S.P. and Anthrax, although nearly half of the U.S. dates would be cancelled because of poor ticket sales.

Black Sabbath began work on new material in October 1986 at AIR Studios in Montserrat with producer Jeff Glixman. The recording was fraught with problems from the beginning, as Glixman left after the initial sessions to be replaced by producer Vic Coppersmith-Heaven. Bassist Dave Spitz quit over &quot;personal issues&quot;, and former Rainbow and Ozzy Osbourne bassist Bob Daisley was brought in. Daisley re-recorded all of the bass tracks, and wrote the album&#x27;s lyrics, but before the album was complete, he left to join Gary Moore&#x27;s backing band, taking drummer Eric Singer with him. After problems with second producer Coppersmith-Heaven, the band returned to Morgan Studios in England in January 1987 to work with new producer Chris Tsangarides. While working in the United Kingdom, new vocalist Ray Gillen abruptly left Black Sabbath to form Blue Murder with guitarist John Sykes (ex-Tygers of Pan Tang, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake) and then Badlands with former Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee. The band auditioned a number of singers, including Jon Oliva of Savatage.

===1987–1990: Martin joins, &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot;, &quot;Headless Cross&quot;, and &quot;Tyr&quot;===

The band enlisted heavy metal vocalist Tony Martin to re-record Gillen&#x27;s tracks, and former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan to complete a few percussion overdubs. Before the release of the new album Black Sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at Sun City, South Africa during the apartheid era. The band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with Artists United Against Apartheid, who had been boycotting South Africa since 1985. Drummer Bev Bevan refused to play the shows, and was replaced by Terry Chimes, formerly of the Clash, while Dave Spitz returned on bass.

After nearly a year in production, &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot; was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers. On-line internet era reviews were mixed. AllMusic said that &quot;Martin&#x27;s powerful voice added new fire&quot; to the band, and the album contained &quot;some of Iommi&#x27;s heaviest riffs in years&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; gave the album two stars, claiming the album was &quot;Black Sabbath in name only&quot;. The album would stall at No. 66 in the United Kingdom, while peaking at 168 in the U.S. The band toured in support of &quot;Eternal Idol&quot; in Germany, Italy and for the first time, Greece. In part due to a backlash from promoters over the South Africa incident, other European shows were cancelled. Bassist Dave Spitz left the band again shortly before the tour, and was replaced by Jo Burt, formerly of Virginia Wolf.

Following the poor commercial performance of &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot;, Black Sabbath were dropped by both Vertigo Records and Warner Bros. Records, and signed with I.R.S. Records. The band took time off in 1988, returning in August to begin work on their next album. As a result of the recording troubles with &quot;Eternal Idol&quot;, Tony Iommi opted to produce the band&#x27;s next album himself. &quot;It was a completely new start&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;I had to rethink the whole thing, and decided that we needed to build up some credibility again&quot;. Iommi enlisted former Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell, long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist Laurence Cottle, and rented a &quot;very cheap studio in England&quot;.

Black Sabbath released &quot;Headless Cross&quot; in April 1989, and it was also ignored by contemporary reviewers, although AllMusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia gave the album four stars and called it &quot;the finest non-Ozzy or Dio Black Sabbath album&quot;. Anchored by the number 62 charting single &quot;Headless Cross&quot;, the album reached number 31 on the UK chart, and number 115 in the U.S. Queen guitarist Brian May, a good friend of Iommi&#x27;s, played a guest solo on the song &quot;When Death Calls&quot;. Following the album&#x27;s release the band added touring bassist Neil Murray, formerly of Colosseum II, National Health, Whitesnake, Gary Moore&#x27;s backing band, and Vow Wow.

The unsuccessful &quot;Headless Cross&quot; U.S. tour began in May 1989 with openers Kingdom Come and Silent Rage, but because of poor ticket sales, the tour was cancelled after just eight shows. The European leg of the tour began in September, where the band were enjoying chart success. After a string of Japanese shows the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with Girlschool. Black Sabbath was one of the first bands to tour Russia, after Mikhail Gorbachev opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989.

The band returned to the studio in February 1990 to record &quot;Tyr&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Headless Cross&quot;. While not technically a concept album, some of the album&#x27;s lyrical themes are loosely based on Norse mythology. &quot;Tyr&quot; was released on 6 August 1990, reaching number 24 on the UK albums chart, but was the first Black Sabbath release not to break the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the U.S. The album would receive mixed internet-era reviews, with AllMusic noting that the band &quot;mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis&quot;, while &quot;Blender&quot; gave the album just one star, claiming that &quot;Iommi continues to besmirch the Sabbath name with this unremarkable collection&quot;. The band toured in support of &quot;Tyr&quot; with Circus of Power in Europe, but the final seven United Kingdom dates were cancelled because of poor ticket sales. For the first time in their career, the band&#x27;s touring cycle did not include U.S. dates.

===1990–1992: Dio rejoins and &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;===
While on his &quot;Lock Up the Wolves&quot; U.S. tour in August 1990, former Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio was joined onstage at the Roy Wilkins Auditorium by Geezer Butler to perform &quot;Neon Knights&quot;. Following the show, the two expressed interest in rejoining Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. &quot;I do regret that in a lot of ways,&quot; Iommi said. &quot;We were at a good point then. We decided to [reunite with Dio] and I don&#x27;t even know why, really. There&#x27;s the financial aspect, but that wasn&#x27;t it. I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had.&quot;

Dio and Butler joined Iommi and Cozy Powell in autumn 1990 to begin the next Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell suffered a broken hip when his horse died and fell on the drummer&#x27;s legs. Unable to complete the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the &quot;Mob Rules&quot; line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Songs were rewritten multiple times. &quot;It was just hard work,&quot; Iommi said. &quot;We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous.&quot; Dio recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort: &quot;It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that&#x27;s why it works. Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album&quot;.

The resulting &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; was released on 22 June 1992. In the U.S., the album was released on 30 June 1992 by Reprise Records, as Dio and his namesake band were still under contract to the label at the time. While the album received mixed , it was the band&#x27;s biggest commercial success in a decade. Anchored by the top 40 rock radio single &quot;TV Crimes&quot;, the album peaked at number 44 on the &quot;Billboard 200.&quot; The album also featured &quot;Time Machine&quot;, a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. Additionally, the perception among fans of a return of some semblance of the &quot;real&quot; Sabbath provided the band with much needed momentum.

Sabbath began touring in support of &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; in July 1992 with Testament, Danzig, Prong, and Exodus. While on tour, former vocalist Ozzy Osbourne announced his first retirement, and invited Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his &quot;No More Tours&quot; tour in Costa Mesa, California. The band agreed, aside from Dio, who told Iommi, &quot;I&#x27;m not doing that. I&#x27;m not supporting a clown.&quot; Dio spoke of the situation years later:

Dio quit Sabbath following a show in Oakland, California on 13 November 1992, one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne&#x27;s retirement show. Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford stepped in at the last minute, performing two nights with the band. Iommi and Butler joined Osbourne and former drummer Ward on stage for the first time since 1985&#x27;s Live Aid concert, performing a brief set of Sabbath songs. This set the stage for a longer-term reunion of the original line-up, though that plan proved short-lived. &quot;Ozzy, Geezer, Tony and Bill announced the reunion of Black Sabbath – again,&quot; remarked Dio. &quot;And I thought that it was a great idea. But I guess Ozzy didn&#x27;t think it was such a great idea… I&#x27;m never surprised when it comes to whatever happens with them. Never at all. They are very predictable. They don&#x27;t talk.&quot;

===1992–1997: Martin rejoins, &quot;Cross Purposes&quot;, and &quot;Forbidden&quot;===
Drummer Vinny Appice left the band following the reunion show to rejoin Ronnie James Dio&#x27;s solo band, later appearing on Dio&#x27;s &quot;Strange Highways&quot; and &quot;Angry Machines&quot;. Iommi and Butler enlisted former Rainbow drummer Bobby Rondinelli, and reinstated former vocalist Tony Martin. The band returned to the studio to work on new material, although the project was not originally intended to be released under the Black Sabbath name. As Geezer Butler explains:

Under pressure from their record label, the band released their seventeenth studio album, &quot;Cross Purposes&quot;, on 8 February 1994, under the Black Sabbath name. The album received mixed reviews, with &quot;Blender&quot; giving the album two stars, calling Soundgarden&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Superunknown&quot; &quot;a far better Sabbath album than this by-the-numbers potboiler&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Bradley Torreano called &quot;Cross Purposes&quot; &quot;the first album since &quot;Born Again&quot; that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record&quot;. The album just missed the Top 40 in the UK reaching number 41, and also reached 122 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the U.S. &quot;Cross Purposes&quot; contained the song &quot;Evil Eye&quot;, which was co-written by Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, although uncredited because of record label restrictions. Touring in support of &quot;Cross Purposes&quot; began in February with Morbid Angel and Motörhead in the U.S. The band filmed a live performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 13 April 1994, which was released on VHS accompanied by a CD, titled &quot;Cross Purposes Live&quot;. After the European tour with Cathedral and Godspeed in June 1994, drummer Bobby Rondinelli quit the band and was replaced by original Black Sabbath drummer Ward for five shows in South America.
Following the touring cycle for &quot;Cross Purposes&quot;, bassist Geezer Butler quit the band for the second time. &quot;I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much preferred the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing&quot;. Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released &quot;Plastic Planet&quot; in 1995. The album contained the song &quot;Giving Up the Ghost&quot;, which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: &quot;You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can&#x27;t admit that you&#x27;re wrong / the spirit is dead and gone&quot; (&quot;I heard it&#x27;s something about me...&quot; said Iommi. &quot;I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven&#x27;t really paid any attention to the lyrics... It&#x27;s nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don&#x27;t want to get into a rift with Geezer. He&#x27;s still a friend.&quot;

Following Butler&#x27;s departure, newly returned drummer Ward once again left the band. Iommi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass and Cozy Powell on drums, effectively reuniting the 1990 &quot;Tyr&quot; line-up. The band enlisted Body Count guitarist Ernie C to produce the new album, which was recorded in London in autumn of 1994. The album featured a guest vocal on &quot;Illusion of Power&quot; by Body Count vocalist Ice-T. The resulting &quot;Forbidden&quot; was released on 8 June 1995, but failed to chart in the U.S. The album was widely panned by critics; AllMusic&#x27;s Bradley Torreano said &quot;with boring songs, awful production, and uninspired performances, this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan&quot;; while &quot;Blender&quot; magazine called &quot;Forbidden&quot; &quot;an embarrassment... the band&#x27;s worst album&quot;.

Black Sabbath embarked on a world tour in July 1995 with openers Motörhead and Tiamat, but two months into the tour, drummer Cozy Powell left the band, citing health issues, and was replaced by former drummer Bobby Rondinelli. &quot;The members I had in the last lineup – Bobby Rondinelli, Neil Murray – they&#x27;re great, great characters...&quot; Iommi told Sabbath fanzine &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. &quot;That, for me, was an ideal lineup. I wasn&#x27;t sure vocally what we should do, but Neil Murray and Bobby Rondinelli I really got on well with.&quot;

After completing Asian dates in December 1995, Tony Iommi put the band on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with former Black Sabbath vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Judas Priest drummer Dave Holland. The album was not officially released following its completion, although a widely traded bootleg called &quot;Eighth Star&quot; surfaced soon after. The album was officially released in 2004 as &quot;The 1996 DEP Sessions&quot;, with Holland&#x27;s drums re-recorded by session drummer Jimmy Copley.

In 1997, Tony Iommi disbanded the current line-up to officially reunite with Ozzy Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath line-up. Vocalist Tony Martin claimed that an original line-up reunion had been in the works since the band&#x27;s brief reunion at Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s 1992 Costa Mesa show, and that the band released subsequent albums to fulfill their record contract with I.R.S. Records. Martin later recalled &quot;Forbidden&quot; (1995) as a &quot;filler album that got the band out of the label deal, rid of the singer, and into the reunion. However I wasn&#x27;t privy to that information at the time&quot;. I.R.S. Records released a compilation album in 1996 to fulfill the band&#x27;s contract, titled &quot;The Sabbath Stones&quot;, which featured songs from &quot;Born Again&quot; (1983) to &quot;Forbidden&quot; (1995).

===1997–2006: Osbourne rejoins and &quot;Reunion&quot;===
In the summer of 1997, Iommi, Butler and Osbourne reunited to coheadline the Ozzfest tour alongside Osbourne&#x27;s solo band. The line-up featured Osbourne&#x27;s drummer Mike Bordin filling in for Ward. &quot;It started off with me going off to join Ozzy for a couple of numbers,&quot; explained Iommi, &quot;and then it got into Sabbath doing a short set, involving Geezer. And then it grew as it went on… We were concerned in case Bill couldn&#x27;t make it – couldn&#x27;t do it – because it was a lot of dates, and important dates… The only rehearsal that we had to do was for the drummer. But I think if Bill had come in, it would have took a lot more time. We would have had to focus a lot more on him.&quot;
In December 1997, the group was joined by Ward, marking the first reunion of the original quartet since Osbourne&#x27;s 1992 &quot;retirement show&quot;. This line-up recorded two shows at the Birmingham NEC, released as the double album &quot;Reunion&quot; on 20 October 1998. The album reached number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, went platinum in the U.S. and spawned the single &quot;Iron Man&quot;, which won Sabbath their first Grammy Award in 2000 for Best Metal Performance, 30 years after the song was originally released. &quot;Reunion&quot; featured two new studio tracks, &quot;Psycho Man&quot; and &quot;Selling My Soul&quot;, both of which cracked the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks&quot; chart.

Shortly before a European tour in the summer of 1998, Ward had a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice. Ward returned for a U.S. tour with openers Pantera, which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer, headlining the annual Ozzfest tour. Following these appearances, the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material. Iommi released his first official solo album, &quot;Iommi&quot;, in 2000, while Osbourne continued work on &quot;Down to Earth&quot; (2001).

Sabbath returned to the studio to work on new material with all four original members and producer Rick Rubin in the spring of 2001, but the sessions were halted when Osbourne was called away to finish tracks for his solo album in the summer. &quot;It just came to an end…&quot; Iommi said. &quot;It&#x27;s a shame because [the songs] were really Iommi commented on the difficulty getting all the members together to work:

In March 2002, Osbourne&#x27;s Emmy-winning reality show &quot;The Osbournes&quot; debuted on MTV, and quickly became a worldwide hit. The show introduced Osbourne to a broader audience and to capitalise, the band&#x27;s back catalogue label, Sanctuary Records released a double live album &quot;Past Lives&quot; (2002), which featured concert material recorded in the 1970s, including the &quot;Live at Last&quot; (1980) album. The band remained on hiatus until the summer of 2004 when they returned to headline Ozzfest 2004 and 2005. In November 2005, Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and in March 2006, after eleven years of eligibility—Osbourne famously refused the Hall&#x27;s &quot;meaningless&quot; initial nomination in 1999—the band were inducted into the U.S. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the awards ceremony Metallica played two Sabbath songs, &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot; in tribute.

===2006–2010: &quot;The Dio Years&quot; and Heaven &amp; Hell===
While Ozzy Osbourne was working on new solo album material in 2006, Rhino Records released &quot;Black Sabbath: The Dio Years&quot;, a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio, and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. &quot;The Dio Years&quot; was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while the single &quot;The Devil Cried&quot; reached number 37 on the &quot;Mainstream Rock Tracks&quot; chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Dio era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi, and Ward was still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven &amp; Hell, after the album of the same title, to avoid confusion. When asked about the name of the group, Iommi stated &quot;it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they&#x27;re getting [and] so people won&#x27;t expect to hear &#x27;Iron Man&#x27; and all those songs. We&#x27;ve done them for so many years, it&#x27;s nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again.&quot;
Ward was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with &quot;a couple of the band members&quot;. He was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the &quot;Mob Rules&quot; (1981) and &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; (1992) albums.

Heaven &amp; Hell toured the U.S. with openers Megadeth and Machine Head, and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, titled &quot;Live from Radio City Music Hall&quot;. In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album, which was recorded in the following year. In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the Metal Masters Tour, alongside Judas Priest, Motörhead and Testament. The box set, &quot;The Rules of Hell&quot;, featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour. In 2009, the band announced the title of their debut studio album, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, released on 28 April.

On 26 May 2009, Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41-year career and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members.

In March 2010, Black Sabbath announced that along with Metallica they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate Record Store Day. It was released on 17 April 2010. Ronnie James Dio died on 16 May 2010 from stomach cancer. In June 2010, the legal battle between Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi over the trademarking of the Black Sabbath name ended, but the terms of the settlement have not been disclosed.

===2010–2014: Second Osbourne reunion and &quot;13&quot;===
In a January 2010 interview while promoting his biography &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;, Osbourne stated that although he would not rule it out, he was doubtful there would be a reunion with all four original members of the band. Osbourne stated: &quot;I&#x27;m not gonna say I&#x27;ve written it out forever, but right now I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any chance. But who knows what the future holds for me? If it&#x27;s my destiny, fine.&quot; In July, Butler said that there would be no reunion in 2011, as Osbourne was already committed to touring with his solo band. However, by that August they had already met up to rehearse together, and continued to do so through the autumn.

On 11 November 2011, Iommi, Butler, Osbourne, and Ward announced that they were reuniting to record a new album with a full tour in support beginning in 2012. Guitarist Iommi was diagnosed with lymphoma on 9 January 2012, which forced the band to cancel all but two shows (Download Festival, and Lollapalooza Festival) of a previously booked European tour. It was later announced that an intimate show would be played in their hometown Birmingham. It was the first concert since the reunion and the only indoors concerts that year. In February 2012, drummer Ward announced that he would not participate further in the band&#x27;s reunion until he was offered a &quot;signable contract&quot;.
On 21 May 2012, at the O2 Academy in Birmingham, Black Sabbath played their first concert since 2005, with Tommy Clufetos playing the drums. In June, they performed at the Download Festival at the Donington Park motorsports circuit in Leicestershire, England, followed by the last concert of the short tour at Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago. Later that month, the band started recording an album.

On 13 January 2013, the band announced that the album would be released in June under the title &quot;13&quot;. Brad Wilk (formerly of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave) was chosen as the drummer, and Rick Rubin was chosen as the producer. Mixing of the album commenced in February. On 12 April 2013, the band released the album&#x27;s track listing. The standard version of the album features eight new tracks, and the deluxe version features three bonus tracks.
The band&#x27;s first single from &quot;13&quot;, &quot;God Is Dead?&quot;, was released on 19 April 2013. On 20 April 2013, Black Sabbath commenced their first Australia/New Zealand tour in 40 years followed by a North American Tour in Summer 2013. The second single of the album, &quot;End of the Beginning&quot;, debuted on 15 May in a &quot;&quot; episode, where all three members appeared. In June 2013, &quot;13&quot; topped both the UK Albums Chart and the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming their first album to reach number one on the latter chart. In 2014, Black Sabbath received their first Grammy Award since 2000 with &quot;God Is Dead?&quot; winning Best Metal Performance.

In July 2013, Black Sabbath embarked on a North American Tour (for the first time since July 2001), followed by a Latin American tour in October 2013. In November 2013, the band started their European tour which lasted until December 2013. In March and April 2014, they made 12 stops in North America (mostly in Canada) as the second leg of their North American Tour before embarking in June 2014 on the second leg of their European tour, which ended with a concert at London&#x27;s Hyde Park.

===2014–2017: Cancelled twentieth album, &quot;The End&quot;, and disbandment===
On 29 September 2014, Osbourne told &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; that Black Sabbath would begin work on their twentieth studio album in early 2015 with producer Rick Rubin, followed by a final tour in 2016. In an April 2015 interview, however, Osbourne said that these plans &quot;could change&quot;, and added, &quot;We all live in different countries and some of them want to work and some of them don&#x27;t want to, I believe. But we are going to do another tour together.&quot;
On 3 September 2015, it was announced that Black Sabbath would embark on their final tour, titled The End, from January 2016 to February 2017. Numerous dates and locations across the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand were announced. The final shows of The End tour took place at the Genting Arena in their home city of Birmingham, England on 2 and 4 February 2017. On 26 October 2015, it was announced the band consisting of Osbourne, Iommi and Butler would be returning to the Download Festival on 11 June 2016. Despite earlier reports that they would enter the studio before their farewell tour, Osbourne stated that there would not be another Black Sabbath studio album. However, an 8-track CD entitled &quot;The End&quot; was sold at dates on the tour. Along with some live recordings, the CD includes four unused tracks from the &quot;13&quot; sessions.

On 4 March 2016, Iommi discussed future re-releases of the Tony Martin-era catalogue: &quot;We&#x27;ve held back on the reissues of those albums because of the current Sabbath thing with Ozzy Osbourne, but they will certainly be happening... I&#x27;d like to do a couple of new tracks for those releases with Tony Martin... I&#x27;ll also be looking at working on &quot;Cross Purposes&quot; and &quot;Forbidden&quot;.&quot; Martin had suggested that this could coincide with the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot;, in 2017. In an interview that August, Martin added &quot;[Iommi] still has his cancer issues of course and that may well stop it all from happening but if he wants to do something I am ready.&quot; On 10 August 2016, Iommi revealed that his cancer was in remission.

Asked in November 2016 about his plans after Black Sabbath&#x27;s final tour, Iommi replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll be doing some writing. Maybe I&#x27;ll be doing something with the guys, maybe in the studio, but no touring.&quot; The band played their final concert on 4 February 2017 in Birmingham. The final song was streamed live on the band&#x27;s Facebook page and fireworks went off as the band took their final bow. The band&#x27;s final tour was not an easy one, as longstanding tensions between Osbourne and Iommi returned to the surface. Iommi stated that he would not rule out the possibility of one-off shows, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t write that off, if one day that came about. That&#x27;s possible. Or even doing an album, &#x27;cause then, again, you&#x27;re in one place. But I don&#x27;t know if that would happen.&quot; In an April 2017 interview, Butler revealed that Black Sabbath considered making a blues album as the follow-up to &quot;13&quot;, but added that, &quot;the tour got in the way.&quot;

On 7 March 2017, Black Sabbath announced their disbandment through posts made on their official social media accounts.

===2017–2024: Post-final tour activities===
In a June 2018 interview with ITV News, Osbourne expressed interest in reuniting with Black Sabbath for a performance at the 2022 Commonwealth Games which would be held in their home city Birmingham. Iommi said that performing at the event as Black Sabbath would be &quot;a great thing to do to help represent Birmingham. I&#x27;m up for it. Let&#x27;s see what happens.&quot; He also did not rule out the possibility for the band to reform only for a one-off performance rather than a full-length tour. Iommi was later announced to be part of the opening ceremony for the 2022 Commonwealth Games alongside Duran Duran. On 8 August 2022, Osbourne and Iommi made a surprise reunion to end the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games at the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham. They were joined by 2017 Black Sabbath touring musicians Tommy Clufetos and Adam Wakeman for a medley of &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot;.

In September 2020, Osbourne stated in an interview that he was no longer interested in a reunion: &quot;Not for me. It&#x27;s done. The only thing I do regret is not doing the last farewell show in Birmingham with Bill Ward. I felt really bad about that. It would have been so nice. I don&#x27;t know what the circumstances behind it were, but it would have been nice. I&#x27;ve talked to Tony a few times, but I don&#x27;t have any of the slightest interest in doing another gig. Maybe Tony&#x27;s getting bored now.&quot; Butler also ruled out the possibility of any future Black Sabbath performances in an interview with Eonmusic on 10 November 2020, stating that the band were over: &quot;There will definitely be no more Sabbath. It&#x27;s done.&quot; Iommi however, pondered the possibility of another reunion tour in an interview with &quot;The Mercury News&quot;, stating that he &quot;would like to play with the guys again&quot; and that he missed the audiences and stage. Ward stated in an interview with Eddie Trunk that he no longer had the ability or chops to perform with Black Sabbath in concert, but expressed that he would love to make another album with Osbourne, Butler and Iommi.

Despite ruling out the possibility of another Black Sabbath reunion, Osbourne revealed in an episode of &quot;Ozzy Speaks&quot; on Ozzy&#x27;s Boneyard that he was working with Iommi, who appeared as one of the guests for his thirteenth solo album, &quot;Patient Number 9&quot; (2022). In an October 2021 interview with the &quot;Metro&quot;, Ward revealed that he had kept &quot;in contact&quot; with his former bandmates and stated that he was &quot;very open-minded&quot; to the possibility of recording another Black Sabbath album: &quot;I haven&#x27;t spoken to the guys about it, but I have talked to a couple of people in management about the possibility of making a recording.&quot;

On 30 September 2020, Black Sabbath announced a new Dr. Martens shoe collection. The partnership with the British footwear company celebrated the 50th anniversaries of the band&#x27;s &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot; albums, with the boots depicting artwork from the former. On 13 January 2021, the band announced that they would reissue both &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot; and &quot;Mob Rules&quot; as expanded deluxe editions on 5 March 2021, with unreleased material included.

In September 2022, Osbourne reiterated that he was unwilling to continue Black Sabbath, stating that if the band were to make another album, he would not sing on it. However, he remained open to working with Iommi on more solo projects following the latter&#x27;s involvement on &quot;Patient Number 9&quot;. Osbourne later retired from touring in February 2023 after not sufficiently recovering from medical treatment, putting the possibility of another Black Sabbath reunion in concert in further doubt. Butler, who had retired in June 2023, insisted that Black Sabbath had been &quot;put to bed&quot;, until August 2023 when he stated that he was open to performing a one-off show, but expressed that he had &quot;no desire to tour again&quot; with Black Sabbath. According to Iommi, the band were offered, but turned down, a reunion at Power Trip in October 2023, where Osbourne was initially scheduled to headline the festival&#x27;s second date; he eventually cancelled his appearance and was replaced by Judas Priest, due to health issues. In May 2024, Osbourne renewed interest in a reunion of the original line-up, admitting he was sad that Ward was not part of the final tour and that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t Black Sabbath that finished it. It&#x27;s unfinished. If they wanted to do one more gig with Bill, I would jump at the chance.&quot; Iommi, Butler and Ward all later expressed interest in the possibility of a one-off reunion show featuring the original line-up.

The Birmingham Royal Ballet presented &quot;Black Sabbath: The Ballet&quot; which premiered at the Birmingham Hippodrome in September 2023, before touring to Theatre Royal, Plymouth and Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in October.

A box set of Tony Martin-era albums, &quot;Anno Domini 1989–1995&quot;, was released on 31 May 2024 and includes remasters of &quot;Headless Cross&quot;, &quot;Tyr&quot; and &quot;Cross Purposes&quot; and a remixed version of &quot;Forbidden&quot;; each disc of the box set (except &quot;Tyr&quot;) includes one bonus track.

===2025: Final reunion ===

In February 2025, Osbourne announced that the original line-up of Black Sabbath would reform for one final charity show at Villa Park, Birmingham on 5 July. Titled Back to the Beginning, it is set to be the final gig for both Osbourne and the group. It will be Black Sabbath&#x27;s first concert in eight years and will also mark the first time in twenty years that the original line-up of the band has performed together. Proceeds from the show are going to support Cure Parkinsons, Birmingham Children&#x27;s Hospital and Acorns Children&#x27;s Hospice. Tom Morello was announced as the show&#x27;s musical director. Osbourne said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to get up there and do a half-hearted Ozzy looking for sympathy. What&#x27;s the fucking point in that? I&#x27;m not going up there in a fucking wheelchair.&quot; In addition to a solo performance by Osbourne, the supporting acts for the show will be Metallica, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Tool, Slayer, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Halestorm, Lamb of God, Anthrax, Mastodon and Rival Sons, and it will include &quot;additional performances from&quot; Morello, Billy Corgan, Slash, David Draiman, Sammy Hagar, Fred Durst, former Judas Priest guitarist K. K. Downing, and three former members of Osbourne&#x27;s solo band (Rudy Sarzo, Jake E. Lee and Mike Bordin).

==Musical style==
Black Sabbath are a heavy metal band. The band have also been cited as a key influence on genres including stoner rock, grunge, doom metal, and sludge metal. Early on, Black Sabbath were influenced by Cream, The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix, John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, Blue Cheer, Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, and Iron Butterfly.

Although Black Sabbath went through many line-ups and stylistic changes, their core sound focuses on ominous lyrics and doomy music, often making use of the musical tritone, also called the &quot;devil&#x27;s interval&quot;. While their Ozzy-era albums such as &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; (1973) had slight compositional similarities to the progressive rock genre that was growing in popularity at the time, standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s, Black Sabbath&#x27;s dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era. Much like many of their early heavy metal contemporaries, the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio.

As the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, Tony Iommi wrote the majority of Black Sabbath&#x27;s music, while Osbourne would write vocal melodies, and bassist Geezer Butler would write lyrics. The process was sometimes frustrating for Iommi, who often felt pressured to come up with new material: &quot;If I didn&#x27;t come up with anything, nobody would do anything.&quot; On Iommi&#x27;s influence, Osbourne later said:

Beginning with their third album, &quot;Master of Reality&quot; (1971), Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi suffered an accident while working in a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band&#x27;s history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.

==Legacy==

Black Sabbath has sold over 70 million records worldwide, including a RIAA-certified 15 million in the U.S. They are one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time. The band helped to create the genre with ground-breaking releases such as &quot;Paranoid&quot; (1970), an album that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine said &quot;changed music forever&quot;, and called the band &quot;the Beatles of heavy metal&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;Paranoid&quot; &quot;the birthplace of heavy metal&quot;, placing it in their Top 100 Albums of All Time.

MTV placed Black Sabbath at number one on their Top Ten Heavy Metal Bands and VH1 placed them at number two on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. VH1 ranked Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man&quot; the number one song on their 40 Greatest Metal Songs countdown. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the band number 85 in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann said:

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Holly George-Warren, &quot;Black Sabbath was the heavy metal king of the 1970s.&quot; Although initially &quot;despised by rock critics and ignored by radio programmers&quot;, the group sold more than 8 million albums by the end of that decade. &quot;&quot;The&quot; heavy metal band…&quot; marvelled Ronnie James Dio. &quot;A band that didn&#x27;t apologise for coming to town; it just stepped on buildings when it came to town.&quot;

===Influence and innovation===
Black Sabbath have influenced many acts including Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, Slayer, Metallica, Korn, Black Flag, Mayhem, Venom, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Body Count, Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Disturbed, Death, Opeth, Pantera, Megadeth, Sepultura, the Smashing Pumpkins, Slipknot, Foo Fighters, Testament, Fear Factory, Candlemass, Godsmack, Corrosion of Conformity, and Van Halen. Two Gold-selling tribute albums have been released, &quot;Nativity in Black Volume 1 &amp; 2&quot;, including covers by Sepultura, White Zombie, Type O Negative, Faith No More, Machine Head, Primus, System of a Down, and Monster Magnet.

Metallica&#x27;s Lars Ulrich, who, along with bandmate James Hetfield inducted Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, said &quot;Black Sabbath is and always will be synonymous with heavy metal&quot;, while Hetfield said &quot;Sabbath got me started on all that evil-sounding shit, and it&#x27;s stuck with me. Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff.&quot; Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash said of the &quot;Paranoid&quot; album: &quot;There&#x27;s just something about that whole record that, when you&#x27;re a kid and you&#x27;re turned onto it, it&#x27;s like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...&quot;Paranoid&quot; is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony&#x27;s playing style—doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s off &quot;Paranoid&quot; or if it&#x27;s off &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;—it&#x27;s very distinctive.&quot; Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said &quot;I always get the question in every interview I do, &#x27;What are your top five metal albums?&#x27; I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums.&quot;

Lamb of God&#x27;s Chris Adler said: &quot;If anybody who plays heavy metal says that they weren&#x27;t influenced by Black Sabbath&#x27;s music, then I think that they&#x27;re lying to you. I think all heavy metal music was, in some way, influenced by what Black Sabbath did.&quot; Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: &quot;They were and still are a groundbreaking band...you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that&#x27;s because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath are in the same league as the Beatles or Mozart. They&#x27;re on the leading edge of something extraordinary.&quot; On Black Sabbath&#x27;s standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: &quot;The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come.&quot; Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that &quot;Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre&quot;.

According to Tracii Guns of L.A. Guns and former member of Guns N&#x27; Roses, the main riff of &quot;Paradise City&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses, from &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987), was influenced by the song &quot;Zero the Hero&quot; from the &quot;Born Again&quot; album. King Diamond guitarist Andy LaRocque affirmed that the clean guitar part of &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot; from &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (1989) is inspired by Tony Iommi&#x27;s playing on &quot;Never Say Die!&quot;.

In addition to being pioneers of heavy metal, they also have been credited for laying the foundations for heavy metal subgenres stoner rock, sludge metal, thrash metal, black metal and doom metal. Sabbath has had a significant impact on alternative music, being cited as an influence by Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Dinosaur Jr.. Rock critic Simon Reynolds writes that when late 1980s bands such as Tad and the Butthole Surfers &quot;revived Black Sabbath&#x27;s ponderous riffs, it felt like a daring challenge to the approved canon of underground rock&quot;, and that &quot;Sabbath-style heaviness&quot; became the norm after the commercial emergence of grunge.

Tony Iommi has been credited as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The tips of his fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.

Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band with the immortal line: &#x27;Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath&#x27;. Contemporary music and arts publication &quot;Trebuchet Magazine&quot; has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.

<doc id="4315" wikidata="Q221626" url="?curid=4315" title="Buffalo Bills">
<text>The Buffalo Bills are a professional American football team based in the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The Bills compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, and is building a new stadium which will be completed in 2026.

Founded in 1959 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL), the team joined the NFL in 1970 following the AFL–NFL merger. The Bills&#x27; name is derived from an All-America Football Conference (AAFC) franchise from Buffalo that was in turn named after western frontiersman Buffalo Bill. Drawing much of its fanbase from western New York and neighboring southern Ontario, the Bills are the only NFL team that plays home games in the state of New York. The franchise is owned by Terry Pegula, who purchased the Bills after the death of the original owner Ralph Wilson in 2014, and a coalition of private equity funds and investors who purchased a minority stake in the team in 2024.

The Bills advanced to the AFL Championship Game three years in a row from 1964 to 1966, winning the first two. To date, these are the only major professional sports championships from a team representing Buffalo. They struggled heavily in the latter years of the AFL and for much of their first two decades in the NFL, tallying only five winning seasons and three postseason berths from 1967 to 1987. However, they were perennial postseason contenders from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, peaking between 1990 and 1993 when they appeared in a record four consecutive Super Bowls, an accomplishment often overshadowed by the fact they lost all four. From the early 2000s to the mid-2010s, the Bills endured the longest playoff drought of 17 years in the four major North American professional sports, making them the last franchise in the four leagues to qualify for the postseason in the 21st century. They returned to consistent postseason contention by the late 2010s, although the Bills have not returned to the Super Bowl. Alongside the Minnesota Vikings, their four Super Bowl appearances are the most among NFL franchises that have not won the Super Bowl.

In December 2024, the Bills became one of the first teams in NFL history to sell part of their franchise to outside private equity investors. 20.6% of the team interest was sold at a valuation of $5.6 billion, including 10% to the American investment group Arctos Partners LP.

==History==

The Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League led by head coach Buster Ramsey and joined the NFL as part of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. In the first two seasons, the Bills went 5–8–1 and 6–8 under Ramsey. The Bills won two consecutive American Football League titles in 1964 and 1965 with quarterback Jack Kemp and coach Lou Saban, but the club has yet to win a league championship since.

Once the AFL–NFL merger took effect, the Bills became the second NFL team to represent the city; they followed the Buffalo All-Americans, a charter member of the league. Buffalo had been left out of the league since the All-Americans (by that point renamed the Bisons) folded in 1929; the Bills were no less than the third professional non-NFL team to compete in the city before the merger, following the Indians/Tigers of the early 1940s and an earlier team named the Bills, originally the Bisons, in the late 1940s in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC).

Following the AFL–NFL merger, the Bills were generally mediocre in the 1970s but featured All-Pro running back O. J. Simpson. After being pushed to the brink of failure in the mid-1980s, the collapse of the United States Football League and a series of highly drafted players such as Jim Kelly (who initially played for the USFL instead of the Bills), Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith and Darryl Talley allowed the Bills to rebuild into a perennial contender in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s under head coach Marv Levy, a period in which the team won four consecutive AFC Championships; the team nevertheless lost all four subsequent Super Bowls, records in both categories that still stand.

The rise of the division rival New England Patriots under Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, along with numerous failed attempts at rebuilding in the 2000s and 2010s, helped prevent the Bills from reaching the playoffs in seventeen consecutive seasons between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year drought that was the longest active playoff drought in all major professional sports at the time.

Mike Mularkey coached the Bills in the 2004 and 2005 seasons. He went 9–7 but missed the postseason in 2004 and 5–11 in 2005. He resigned from the team following the 2005 season.

From 2006 to 2009, the Bills were coached by Dick Jauron. Following three consecutive 7–9 seasons, Jauron was dismissed after a 3–6 start to his fourth season. Perry Fewell finished out the season as interim with a 3–4 mark.

From 2010 to 2012, the Bills were coached by Chan Gailey. The team had Ryan Fitzpatrick as their quarterback in those seasons. Gailey was fired after three consecutive last place finishes in the AFC East.

Doug Marrone was hired to be the Bills&#x27; head coach prior to the 2013 season. The Bills went 6–10 in the 2013 season and improved to 9–7 in the 2014 season. Marrone decided to step down as head coach following the season. On October 8, 2014, Buffalo Sabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula received unanimous approval to acquire the Bills during the NFL owners&#x27; meetings, becoming the second ownership group of the team after team founder Ralph Wilson. After Kim was incapacitated by a 2022 vascular brain injury, a portion of her stake in the team was transferred to her stepdaugher Laura, with a 20% stake in the team sold to a coalition of private equity investors and former Toronto athletes Jozy Altidore, Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady in December 2024.

Prior to the 2015 season, the team hired former Jets&#x27; head coach Rex Ryan to become the next head coach of the Bills. The team went 8–8 in 2015 and 7–9 in 2016. Ryan was dismissed with one game remaining in the 2016 season, with Anthony Lynn finishing the season as interim.

===Sean McDermott era (2017–present)===
Under head coach Sean McDermott, the Bills broke the playoff drought, appearing in the playoffs for six of the next seven seasons. The team drafted Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft. The team earned its first division championship and playoff wins since 1995 during the 2020 season, aided by Brady&#x27;s departure to Tampa Bay and out of the AFC East, as well as the Bills&#x27; own development of a core of talent including Allen, Stefon Diggs, Matt Milano, and Tre&#x27;Davious White. In the 2020 season, the Bills reached the AFC Championship for the first time since the 1993 season. However, their run ended with a 38–24 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Bills won the AFC East with a 11–6 record in the 2021 season. The Bills defeated the Patriots 47–17 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs 42–36 in overtime.

In the 2022 season, the Bills won the AFC East with a 13–3 record. The season saw a cancelled game against the Bengals due to a near-fatal medical episode with Damar Hamlin, who eventually recovered and returned to football activities the following season. The team defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round 34–31 before falling to the Cincinnati Bengals 27–10 in the Divisional Round. In the 2023 season, the Bills won the AFC East for the fourth consecutive season. In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17 before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round 27–24. In the 2024 season, the Bills finished with a 13–4 record and won another AFC East title. Following wins over the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round, the Bills lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship. The Bills announced plans to build a new stadium to replace Highmark Stadium to be ready by 2026.

==Logos and uniforms==
For their first two seasons, the Bills wore uniforms based on those of the Detroit Lions at the time. Ralph Wilson had been a minority owner of the Lions before founding the Bills, and the Bills&#x27; predecessors in the AAFC had also worn blue and silver uniforms.

The team&#x27;s original colors were Honolulu blue, silver, and white, and the helmets were silver with no striping. There was no logo on the helmet, which displayed the players&#x27; numbers on each side.

In 1962, the standing red bison was designated as the logo and took its place on a white helmet. In 1962, the team&#x27;s colors also changed to red, white, and blue. The team switched to blue jerseys with red and white shoulder stripes, similar to the Buffalo Bisons AHL hockey team of the same era. The helmets were white with a red center stripe. The jerseys again saw a change in 1964 when the shoulder stripes were replaced by a distinctive stripe pattern on the sleeves consisting of four stripes, two thicker inner stripes and two thinner outer stripes all bordered by red piping. By 1965, red and blue center stripes were put on the helmets.

The Bills introduced blue pants worn with the white jerseys in 1973, the last year of the standing buffalo helmet. The blue pants remained through 1985. The face mask on the helmet was blue from 1974 through 1986 before changing to white.

The standing bison logo was replaced by a blue charging one with a red slanting stripe streaming from its horn. The newer emblem, still the primary one used by the franchise, was designed by aerospace designer Stevens Wright in 1974.

In 1984, the helmet&#x27;s shell color was changed from white to red, primarily to help Bills quarterback Joe Ferguson distinguish them more readily from three of their division rivals at that time, the Baltimore Colts, the Miami Dolphins, and the New England Patriots, who all also wore white helmets at that point. Ferguson said, &quot;Everyone we played had white helmets at that time. Our new head coach Kay Stephenson just wanted to get more of a contrast on the field that may help spot a receiver down the field.&quot; (The Patriots have worn silver helmets since 1993, the Colts have since been realigned to the AFC South, and in 2019 the New York Jets have since switched back to green-colored helmets, after playing 20 years with white ones.)

In 2002, under the direction of general manager Tom Donahoe, the Bills&#x27; uniforms went through radical changes. A darker shade of blue was introduced as the primary jersey color, and nickel gray was introduced as an accent color. Both the blue and white jerseys featured red side panels. The white jerseys included a dark blue shoulder yoke and royal blue numbers. The helmet remained primarily red with one navy blue, two nickel, two royal blue, two white stripes, and a white face mask. A new logo, a stylized &quot;B&quot; consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo. The helmet logo adopted in 1974—a charging royal blue bison with a red streak, white horn, and eyeball—remained unchanged.

In 2005, the Bills revived the standing bison helmet and uniform of the mid-1960s as a throwback uniform.

The Bills usually wore the all-blue combination at home and the all-white combination on the road when not wearing the throwback uniforms. They stopped wearing blue-on-white after 2006, while the white-on-blue was not worn after 2007.

For the 2011 season, the Bills unveiled a new uniform design, an updated rendition of the 1975–83 design. This change includes a return to the white helmets with &quot;charging buffalo&quot; logo, and a return to royal blue instead of navy. The set initially featured striped socks, but by 2021, the Bills gradually reduced its usage and began wearing either all-white or all-blue hosiery without stripes in most games.

Buffalo sporadically wore white at home in the 1980s, including all eight home games in 1984, but stopped doing so beginning in 1987. On November 6, 2011, against the New York Jets, the Bills wore white at home for the first time since 1986. Since 2011, the Bills have worn white for home games, either with their primary uniform or a throwback set.

The Bills&#x27; uniform received minor alterations as part of the league&#x27;s new uniform contract with Nike. The new Nike uniform was unveiled on April 3, 2012.

On November 12, 2015, the Bills and the New York Jets became the first two teams to participate in the NFL&#x27;s Color Rush uniform initiative, with Buffalo wearing an all-red combination for the first time in team history. Like the primary uniforms, the set initially had red socks with white and blue stripes, but in 2020, it was replaced with red socks without stripes.

A notable use of the Bills&#x27; uniforms outside of football was in the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships when the United States men&#x27;s national junior ice hockey team wore Bills-inspired uniforms in their outdoor game against Team Canada on December 29, 2017. This game was also played at the Bills&#x27; home stadium, Highmark Stadium.

On April 1, 2021, the team announced they would wear white face masks during the upcoming season and beyond.

On December 22, 2024, the team debuted a brand new uniform combination consisting of their red Color Rush uniform and white pants.

==Rivalries==
The Bills have rivalries with their three AFC East opponents (the Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, and New York Jets) and also have rivalries with the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (a former divisional opponent), Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Dallas Cowboys. They also play an annual preseason game against the Detroit Lions.

The Cleveland Browns once shared a rivalry with the Bills&#x27; predecessors in the All-America Football Conference. The current teams have a more friendly relationship and have played sporadically since the AFL–NFL merger.

===Divisional===
====Miami Dolphins====
This is often considered Buffalo&#x27;s most famous rivalry. Though the Bills and Dolphins both originated in the American Football League, the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team, while the Bills were one of the original eight AFL teams. The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent (the Bills defeated the Dolphins in their first match-up of the 1980s). Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of Jim Kelly as Buffalo&#x27;s franchise quarterback. Though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s. Things cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the rise of the New England Patriots in the 2000s and 2010s, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo&#x27;s primary rival, and the two teams have typically been close to each other in win–loss records. Recently, they have often competed for the division title since Tua Tagovailoa became Miami&#x27;s quarterback, despite Buffalo&#x27;s 13–2 record over the Dolphins under Josh Allen. Miami leads the overall series 62–60–1 as of 2024, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 4–1, including a win in the 1992 AFC Championship Game.

====New England Patriots====
The rivalry with the New England Patriots began when both teams were original franchises in the American Football League (AFL) prior to the NFL–AFL merger, but did not gain notability until the emergence of New England quarterback Tom Brady in 2001. The teams were very competitive prior to the 2000s. However, Brady&#x27;s arrival in the early 2000s led to the Patriots dominating the AFC East, including the Bills, for two decades. As a result, New England replaced the Dolphins as Buffalo&#x27;s most hated rival. The Bills have taken a 8–3 edge since Brady&#x27;s departure in 2020, which included consecutive AFC East titles from 2020 to 2024 and a season sweep of the Patriots in two of the first three years. In 2021, the Bills dominated in a 47–17 victory against the Patriots in the two teams&#x27; first playoff match-up in 59 years, which saw the Bills score a touchdown on every offensive drive throughout the entire game and, as such, is the only &quot;perfect offensive game&quot; in NFL history. Overall, the Patriots lead the series 79–51–1 as of 2024, but trail the Bills by a 48–47–1 margin without Brady on the field.

The rivalry is also noted for several players being a members of both teams during their careers, including Drew Bledsoe, Doug Flutie, Lawyer Milloy, Brandon Spikes, Scott Chandler, Chris Hogan, Mike Gillislee, and Stephon Gilmore.

====New York Jets====
The Bills and Jets were both original AFL teams, and both represent the state of New York, though the Jets have played their home games in East Rutherford, New Jersey since 1984. While the rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Western New York, it has historically not been as intense as Buffalo&#x27;s rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots. When not playing one another, the teams&#x27; fan bases either have grudging respect or low-key annoyance for each other (stemming more from the broader upstate-downstate tensions than the teams or sport). The Bills-Jets rivalry has often become characterized by ugly games and shared mediocrity, but it has had a handful of competitive moments. The series heated up recently when former Jets head coach Rex Ryan became the Bills&#x27; head coach for two seasons and had become notable again as Bills quarterback Josh Allen and former Jets quarterback Sam Darnold, both drafted in the same year, maintained a friendly rivalry with one another. Buffalo leads the series 71–58 as of 2024, including a playoff win in 1981.

===Conference===
====Kansas City Chiefs====

The Kansas City Chiefs, another original franchise in the AFL, have a long history against the Bills, despite the two teams never being in the same division. Buffalo currently leads the series 30–26–1, which has included seven playoff meetings, four of which were AFL/AFC Championship Games; Kansas City won the 1966 AFL Championship Game that determined the AFL&#x27;s representative in the first Super Bowl against the NFL champion Green Bay Packers, in addition to the 2020 and 2024 AFC Championship Games that saw the team advance to its second and fifth Super Bowl appearances in six years, respectively, while Buffalo defeated Kansas City in the 1993 AFC Championship Game to advance to its fourth straight Super Bowl appearance. However, after each victory in the AFC Championship Game, the Chiefs or the Bills went on to lose the ensuing Super Bowl. Despite a lull in the series in the 2000s and 2010s, the rivalry gained attention as the Bills and Chiefs met in nine of ten years from 2008 to 2017. After a two-year hiatus in the series, four high-profile match-ups occurred between the Bills and Chiefs in 2020 and 2021, including the aforementioned 2020 Championship Game and the 2021 Divisional round game, the latter of which is now considered one of the greatest playoff games of all time, but was also controversial due to the league&#x27;s overtime rules. A rivalry between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has also developed, drawing comparisons to Jim Kelly&#x27;s rivalry with Dan Marino as well as the rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning.

====Jacksonville Jaguars====
A new rivalry emerged between the Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars after former Bills head coach Doug Marrone, who had quit the team after the 2014 season, was hired as a coaching assistant for Jacksonville and eventually rose to become the Jaguars&#x27; head coach. The first game between the Marrone-led Jaguars was a London game in week 7 of the 2015 season, which saw the Jaguars&#x27; win 34–31. The most important game of this series was an ugly, low-scoring Wild Card game in 2017 that saw the Jaguars win 10–3. This game is notable as it was the first Bills playoff appearance in 17 seasons. Prior to this, Jacksonville had handed Buffalo its first playoff loss in Bills Stadium in 1996. Following the 2017 wild card game the Bills and Jaguars have met three additional times. The first was a &quot;rematch&quot; game in week 12 of the 2018 season, which saw the Bills win 24–21. During this game, trash talk from former Jaguars players such as Jalen Ramsey resulted in a brawl between the teams. The second time was in week 9 of the 2021 season. By now, the &quot;point&quot; of the rivalry, Marrone&#x27;s feud with the Bills organization, and the personal drama between Bills and Jaguars players no longer applied as Marrone had been fired and replaced by Urban Meyer and all the players from the 2017 Jaguars team have since moved on to other teams or retired. Regardless, this game was the seventh largest upset at the time in NFL history, which saw the 15.5-point favorite Bills lose 9–6. The most recent meeting between the two teams was a 47–10 Bills win on Monday Night Football in 2024. The series is currently tied at 10–10.

====Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans====

The Tennessee Titans (formerly the Houston Oilers) share an extended history with the Bills, both teams being original AFL clubs and rivals in that league&#x27;s East Division before the AFL-NFL merger. Match-ups were intense in the 1990s, with quarterback Warren Moon leading the Oilers against Jim Kelly&#x27;s Bills. After both teams failed to meet the same success in the late 2000s to early 2010s, they have returned to consistent playoff contention since 2017, resulting in several high-profile games as of late. Memorable playoff moments between the teams include The Comeback, in which the Frank Reich-led Bills overcame a 35–3 deficit to stun the Oilers 41–38 in 1992, and the Music City Miracle, in which the now-Titans scored on a near-last-minute kickoff return with a controversial lateral pass ruling to beat the Bills 22–16 in 1999. The Music City Miracle was notable for being Buffalo&#x27;s last playoff appearance until 2017. The Titans currently lead the series 30–21.

==Notable players==

===Retired numbers===
The Buffalo Bills have retired three numbers in franchise history: No. 12 for Jim Kelly, No. 34 for Thurman Thomas, and No. 78 for Bruce Smith. Although the Bills have retired only three jersey numbers, other numbers are no longer issued or are in reduced circulation.
;Reduced circulation:
* 83 Andre Reed, WR, 1985–1999 &quot;(Lee Evans III wore No. 83 by special permission)&quot;

Since the team&#x27;s earliest days, the number 31 was not supposed to be issued to any other player. The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person but the &#x27;spirit of the team.&#x27; In the first three decades of the team&#x27;s existence, the number 31 was only seen once. In 1969, when reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber damaged his number 36 jersey during a game, equipment manager Tony Marchitte gave him the number 31 jersey to wear while repairing the number 36. The number 31 was not reissued until 1990 when first-round draft choice James Williams wore it for his first two seasons; it has since been returned to general circulation. Cornerback Rasul Douglas currently wears the 31 since he joined the Bills in 2023.

Number 32 had been withdrawn from circulation but not retired after O. J. Simpson. Former owner Ralph Wilson insisted on not reissuing the number, even after Simpson&#x27;s highly publicized murder case and later robbery conviction. The number was placed back into circulation in 2019 with Senorise Perry wearing the number that year; it was most recently worn by linebacker Nicholas Morrow until he was waived in January 2025.

Number 15 was historically only issued sparingly after the retirement of Jack Kemp. It was last worn by wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling in 2024, before he was released on October 15, 2024. Other numbers that have been historically issued only on rare circumstances included the 44 of Elbert Dubenion (worn as of 2024 by Joe Andreessen) and the 66 of Billy Shaw (worn since 2023 by Connor J. McGovern), each of which were typically only issued to players not expected to make the team&#x27;s regular season roster.

Number 1 has also rarely been used for reasons yet to be explained. While there is no proper explanation, Tommy Hughitt was a player-coach for the early Buffalo teams in the New York Pro Football League and NFL from 1918 to 1924 and was both a major on-field success and a fixture in Buffalo culture after his retirement as a politician and auto salesman. Hughitt was reported to wear number 1 during this time. Wide receiver Curtis Samuel currently wears the number; prior to Emmanuel Sanders&#x27;s one-year stint with the Bills in 2021, it had been 19 years since it had been worn in the regular season when kicker Mike Hollis wore it in 2002.

Number 95 has not been reissued since the retirement of Kyle Williams in 2019.

==Radio and television==

The Buffalo Bills Radio Network is flagshipped at WGR AM 550 in Buffalo, with sister station WWKB AM 1520 simulcasting all home games. Chris Brown is the team&#x27;s current play-by-play announcer, having taken over from John Murphy (the announcer from 2003 to 2022 and color commentator most years from 1984 to 2003) after Murphy suffered a stroke. Former Bills center Eric Wood is the color analyst.

In 2018, the team signed an agreement with Nexstar Media Group to carry Bills preseason games across its network of stations in the region. As of 2020, WIVB-TV serves as the flagship station of the network, which includes WJET-TV in Erie, WROC-TV in Rochester, WSYR-TV in Syracuse, WUTR in Utica, WETM-TV in Elmira and WIVT in Binghamton. Steve Tasker does color commentary on these games; the play-by-play position is rotated between Andrew Catalon and Rob Stone. WROC-TV reporter Thad Brown is the sideline reporter. Since 2008, preseason games have been broadcast in high definition.

Beginning in the 2016 season, as per a new rights deal that covers rights to the team as well as its sister NHL franchise, the Buffalo Sabres, most team-related programming, including studio programming and the coach&#x27;s show, was re-located to MSG Western New York—a joint venture of MSG and the team ownership. Preseason games will continue to air in simulcast on broadcast television.

In the event that regular-season games are broadcast by ESPN, in accordance with the league&#x27;s television policies, a local Buffalo station will broadcast the game. From 2014 to 2017, WKBW-TV held the broadcast rights to that contest, with the station winning back the rights to cable games after WBBZ-TV held the rights for 2012 and 2013.

==Training camp sites==
* 1960–1962, Roycroft Inn, East Aurora, New York
* 1963–1967, Camelot Hotel, Blasdell, New York
* 1968–1980, Niagara University, Lewiston, New York
* 1981–1999, State University of New York at Fredonia, Fredonia, New York
* 2000–present, St. John Fisher University, Pittsford, New York

==Mascots, cheerleaders, and marching band==
The Bills&#x27; official mascot is Billy Buffalo, an eight-foot-tall, anthropomorphic blue American bison who wears the jersey &quot;number&quot; BB.

The Bills do not have cheerleaders. The Bills operated a cheerleading squad named the Buffalo Jills from 1967 to 1985; from 1986 to 2013, the Jills operated as an independent organization sponsored by various companies. The Jills suspended operations prior to the 2014 season due to legal actions. The Bills and Jills were previously involved in a legal battle, in which the Jills alleged they were employees, not independent contractors, and sought back pay. On March 3, 2022, a settlement was reached where the Bills agreed to pay the Jills $3.5 million, while Cumulus Media paid $4 million in stock options of the company while admitting no wrongdoing.

The Bills are one of six teams in the NFL to designate an official marching band or drumline (the others being the Baltimore Ravens, Washington Commanders, New York Jets, Carolina Panthers and Seattle Seahawks). Since the last game of the 2013 season, this position has been served by the Stampede Drumline, known outside of Buffalo as Downbeat Percussion.

The Bills have several theme songs associated with them. The most popular is a variation of the Isley Brothers hit &quot;Shout,&quot; recorded by Scott Kemper, which served as the Bills&#x27; official promotional song from 1987 through 1990s. It can be heard at every Bills home game following a field goal or touchdown and at the game&#x27;s end if the Bills win. The Bills&#x27; unofficial fight song, &quot;Go Bills,&quot; was penned by Bills head coach Marv Levy in the mid-1990s on a friendly wager with his players that he will write the song if the team won a particular game. In 2024, the Bills offensive players began a tradition of singing along to &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; by The Killers as a hype song, usually in the fourth quarter; the Bills were undefeated at home in 2024 after the song was introduced.

==Supporters==

The &quot;Bills Backers&quot; are the official fan organization of the Buffalo Bills. It has over 200 chapters across North America, Europe, and Oceania. Also notable is the &quot;Bills Mafia,&quot; organized via Twitter beginning in 2010 by Del Reid, Leslie Wille, and Breyon Harris; the phrase &quot;Bills Mafia&quot; had by 2017 grown to unofficially represent the broad community surrounding and encompassing the team as a whole, and players who join the Bills often speak of joining the Bills Mafia. Outsiders frequently treat the Bills&#x27; fan base in derogatory terms, especially since the 2010s, partly because of negative press coverage of select fans&#x27; wilder antics. In 2020, the Bills filed to trademark the &quot;Bills Mafia&quot; name.

Bills fans are particularly well known for their wearing of Zubaz zebra-printed sportswear; so much is the association between Bills fans and Zubaz that when a revival of the company opened its first brick-and-mortar storefront, it chose Western New York as its first location. The &quot;wing hat,&quot; a hat shaped like a spicy chicken wing (much in the same style as the Green Bay Packers&#x27; Cheesehead hats), can also frequently be seen atop Bills fans&#x27; heads, having originated as promotional merchandise by the Anchor Bar, the purported inventors of the modern chicken wing as a delicacy. Another hat associated with the Bills fandom is the water buffalo hat, resembling the headgear of the fictional Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes seen in the TV series &quot;The Flintstones&quot;; this hat gained particular popularity with the Water Buffalo Club 716, a community of over 2,000 Bills supporters from around the world founded in 2021 by Therese Forton-Barnes. In 1982, a local grocery store introduced the Whammy Weenie as a promotional item, a maraca-like hot dog-shaped device, painted green (which was not a Bills color, but instead painted as such in reference to a military slang term), that Bills fans were supposed to shake at the team&#x27;s opponents; Bills owner Ralph Wilson, after having seen a Whammy Weenie dangled in front of his suite in the midst of a disappointing season, ordered the Whammy Weenie to be discontinued due to the double entendre it posed.

Bills Mafia members are also well known for jumping off of elevated surfaces (often cars or RVs) into folding tables, in the style of professional wrestlers, during the pre-game tailgate.

Bills fans are noted for their frequent support for charitable causes, especially helping charities run by players from opposing teams. After the Bills received help in breaking their 17-year playoff drought through a last-minute Cincinnati Bengals victory, Bills fans crowdfunded the charities of Bengals players Andy Dalton and Tyler Boyd with hundreds of thousands of dollars as a gesture of thanks. Also in 2020, following a November 8 upset win over the Seattle Seahawks led by one of the best career performances by quarterback Josh Allen, news emerged that Allen had elected to take the field after having been given the option to sit out the contest as he had received news of his grandmother&#x27;s death only the night before. Fans showed support for their team and community by donating nearly $700,000 to the Oishei Children&#x27;s Hospital, an organization supported by Allen throughout his time in Buffalo. Following the Bills&#x27; defeat of the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional round of the 2020–21 NFL playoffs and an injury to Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson late in that game, Bills fans crowdfunded Jackson&#x27;s favorite charity, Blessings in a Backpack. After a 2024 game between the Bills and Miami Dolphins, Bills fans helped raise $18,000 for Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa&#x27;s charity, The Tua Foundation, after Tagovailoa suffered a concussion during the game.

The Bills are one of the favorite teams of ESPN announcer Chris Berman, who picked the Bills to reach the Super Bowl nearly every year in the 1990s. Berman often uses the catchphrase, &quot;No one circles the wagons like the Buffalo Bills!&quot; Berman gave the induction speech for Bills owner Ralph Wilson when Wilson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2009.

The Bills were also the favorite team of late NBC political commentator Tim Russert, a South Buffalo native, who often referred to the Bills on his Sunday morning talk show, &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. (His son, Luke, is also a notable fan of the team.) CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer, also a Buffalo native, has proclaimed he is also a fan, as has &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; lead anchor and Tonawanda native Jeff Glor and DNC Chairman Tom Perez.

ESPN anchor Kevin Connors is also a noted Bills fan, dating to his time attending Ithaca College. Actor Nick Bakay, a Buffalo native, is also a well-known Bills fan; he has discussed the team in segments of &quot;NFL Top 10&quot;. Character actor William Fichtner, raised in Cheektowaga, is a fan, and did a commercial for the team in 2014. In 2015, Fichtner also narrated the ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary on the Bills&#x27; four Super Bowl appearances, &quot;Four Falls of Buffalo&quot;. Former Olympic swimmer Summer Sanders (an in-law to former Bills kicker Todd Schlopy) has professed her fandom of the team. Actor Christopher McDonald, who was raised in Romulus, New York, is a fan of the team.

Persons notable almost entirely for their Bills fandom include Ken &quot;Pinto Ron&quot; Johnson, whose antics while appearing at every Bills home and away game since 1994 earned enough scrutiny that his tailgate parties were banned from stadium property on order of the league; John Lang, an Elvis impersonator who carries a large guitar that he uses as a billboard; Marc Miller, whose professional wrestling promo-style interview with WGRZ prior to Super Bowl XXVII (distinguished by the line &quot;Dallas is going down, Gary!&quot; and picked up at the time by &quot;The George Michael Sports Machine&quot;) was rediscovered in 2019; and Ezra Castro, also known as &quot;Pancho Billa&quot;, a native of El Paso, Texas who wore a large sombrero and lucha mask in Bills colors. Castro was diagnosed with a spinal tumor that had metastasized in 2017; he was invited on stage during the 2018 NFL draft to read one of the Bills&#x27; selections. Castro died on May 14, 2019.

==In popular culture==
Several former Buffalo Bills players earned a name in politics in the late 20th century after their playing careers had ended, nearly always as members of the Republican Party. The most famous of these was quarterback Jack Kemp, who was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Western New York in 1971—two years after his playing career ended and remained there for nearly two decades, serving as the Republican Party nominee for Vice President of the United States under Bob Dole in 1996. Kemp&#x27;s backup, Ed Rutkowski, served as county executive of Erie County from 1979 to 1987. Former tight end Jay Riemersma, defensive tackle Fred Smerlas and defensive end Phil Hansen have all run for Congress, though all three either lost or withdrew from their respective races.

<doc id="4318" wikidata="Q858785" url="?curid=4318" title="Big Dig">
<text>The Big Dig was a megaproject in Boston that rerouted the then elevated Central Artery of Interstate 93 that cut across Boston into the O&#x27;Neill Tunnel and built the Ted Williams Tunnel to extend Interstate 90 to Logan International Airport. Those two projects were the origin of the official name, the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T Project). The project constructed the Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge over the Charles River, created the Rose Kennedy Greenway in the space vacated by the previous I-93 elevated roadway, and funded more than a dozen projects to improve the region&#x27;s public transportation system. Planning for the project began in 1982. Construction work was carried out between 1991 and 2006. The project concluded in December 2007. The project&#x27;s general contractor was Bechtel, with Parsons Brinckerhoff as the engineers, who worked as a consortium, both overseen by the Massachusetts Highway Department.

The Big Dig was the most expensive highway project in the United States, and was plagued by cost overruns, delays, leaks, design flaws, accusations of poor execution and use of substandard materials, criminal charges and arrests, and the death of one motorist. The project was originally scheduled to be completed in 1998 at an estimated cost of $2.8 billion, US$7.4 billion adjusted for inflation . The project was completed in December 2007 at a cost of over $8.08 billion in 1982 dollars, $21.5 billion adjusted for inflation, a cost overrun of about 190%. As a result of a death, leaks, and other design flaws, the Parsons Brinckerhoff and Bechtel consortium agreed to pay $407 million in restitution, and several smaller companies agreed to pay a combined sum of approximately $51 million.

== Origin ==

This project was developed in response to traffic congestion on Boston&#x27;s historically tangled streets, which were laid out centuries before the advent of the automobile. As early as 1930, the city&#x27;s Planning Board recommended a raised express highway running north–south through the downtown district in order to draw through-traffic off the city streets. Commissioner of Public Works William Callahan promoted plans for the Central Artery, an elevated expressway which eventually was constructed between the downtown area and the waterfront.

In the 1950s, Governor John Volpe interceded to change the design of the last section of the Central Artery, putting it underground through the Dewey Square Tunnel. While traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), the elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, &quot;like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists).&quot;

In 1959, the road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day. By the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day. Traffic jams of 16 hours were predicted for 2010.

The expressway had tight turns, an excessive number of entrances and exits, entrance ramps without merge lanes, and as the decades passed and other planned expressways were cancelled, continually escalating vehicular traffic that was well beyond its design capacity. Local businesses again wanted relief, city leaders sought a reuniting of the waterfront with the city, and nearby residents desired removal of the matte green-painted elevated road, which mayor Thomas Menino called Boston&#x27;s &quot;other Green Monster&quot;, as an unfavorable comparison to Fenway Park&#x27;s famed left-field wall. MIT engineers Bill Reynolds, and eventual state Secretary of Transportation Frederick P. Salvucci envisioned moving the whole expressway underground.

=== Cancellation of the Inner Belt project ===

Another important motivation for the final form of the Big Dig was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works&#x27; intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW&#x27;s Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of Interstate 95, and was signed as such. A bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed Interstate 695. The law establishing the Interstate highway system was enacted in 1956.

The Inner Belt District was to pass to the west of the downtown core, through the neighborhood of Roxbury and the cities of Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike, particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of Brighton, and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed, led to massive community opposition to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.

By 1970, building demolition and land clearances had been completed along the I-95 right of way through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, the South End and Roslindale. This led to secession threats by Hyde Park, Boston&#x27;s youngest and southernmost neighborhood, which I-95 was also slated to go through. By 1972, with relatively little work done on the Southwest Corridor portion of I-95 and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor Francis Sargent put a moratorium on highway construction within the Route 128 corridor, except for the final short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled.

With ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the Route 128 beltway, and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the Southwest Corridor linear park, and a new right-of-way for the Orange Line subway and Amtrak. Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.

The original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the Maverick Square area of East Boston. It was never built.

=== Mixing of traffic ===
A major reason for the all-day congestion was that the Central Artery carried north–south traffic and east–west traffic. Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport lies across Boston Harbor in East Boston. Before the Big Dig, the only access to the airport from downtown was through the paired Callahan and Sumner tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston—the Massachusetts Turnpike and Storrow Drive—mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.

=== Mass transit ===
A number of public transportation projects were included as part of an environmental mitigation for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II Silver Line tunnel under Fort Point Channel, done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link South Station and Logan Airport.

Construction of the MBTA Green Line extension beyond Lechmere to Medford/Tufts station opened in December 2022. , promised projects to connect the Red and Blue subway lines, and to restore the Green Line streetcar service to the Arborway in Jamaica Plain have not been completed. The Red and Blue subway line connection underwent initial design, but no funding has been designated for the project. The Arborway Line restoration has been abandoned, following a final court decision in 2011.

The original Big Dig plan included the North-South Rail Link, which would have connected North and South Stations, the major passenger train stations in Boston. This aspect of the project was dropped by the state transportation administration early in the Dukakis administration. Negotiations with the federal government had led to an agreement to widen some of the lanes in the new harbor tunnel, and accommodating these would require the tunnel to be deeper and mechanically vented. This left no room for the rail lines. Diesel trains, then in use, passing through the tunnel would have substantially increased the cost of the ventilation system.

== Early planning ==
The project was conceived in the 1970s by the Boston Transportation Planning Review to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to Logan Airport, and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel.

In 1982, planning for the Big Dig as a project officially began. In 1983, environmental impact studies started. In 1987, after years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by the US Congress, but it was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan for being too expensive. When Congress overrode the veto, the project had its green light. In 1991, ground was first broken.

In 1997, the state legislature created the Metropolitan Highway System and transferred responsibility for the Central Artery and Tunnel &quot;CA/T&quot; Project from the Massachusetts Highway Department and the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Office to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA).
The MTA, which had little experience in managing an undertaking of the scope and magnitude of the CA/T Project, hired a joint venture to provide preliminary designs, manage design consultants and construction contractors, track the project&#x27;s cost and schedule, advise MTA on project decisions, and, in some instances, act as the MTA&#x27;s representative. Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA&#x27;s ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.

== Obstacles ==
In addition to political and financial difficulties, the project received resistance from residents of Boston&#x27;s historic North End, who in the 1950s had seen 20% of the neighborhood&#x27;s businesses displaced by development of the Central Artery. In 1993, the North End Waterfront Central Artery Committee (NEWCAC) created, co-founded by Nancy Caruso, representing residents, businesses, and institutions in the North End and Waterfront neighborhoods of Boston. The NEWCAC Committee&#x27;s goal included lessening the impact of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project on the community, representing the neighborhoods to government agencies, keeping the community informed, developing a list of priorities of immediate neighborhood concerns, and promoting responsible and appropriate development of the post-construction artery corridor in the North End and Waterfront neighborhoods.

The political, financial and residential obstacles were magnified when several environmental and engineering obstacles occurred. The downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely land fill, and included existing Red Line and Blue Line subway tunnels as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.

The project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of rats, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing. By the time the federal environmental clearances were delivered in 1994, the process had taken some seven years, during which time inflation greatly increased the project&#x27;s original cost estimates.

Reworking such a busy corridor without seriously restricting traffic flow required a number of state-of-the-art construction techniques. Because the old elevated highway, which remained in operation throughout the construction process, rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized slurry wall techniques to create concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the continued excavation process.

The multi-lane Interstate highway also had to pass under South Station&#x27;s seven railroad tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed jack was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used ground freezing (an artificial induction of permafrost) to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railroad lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient excavation, and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional cut-and-cover method had been applied.

Other challenges included existing subway tunnels crossing the path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels&#x27; weight, without interrupting rail service.

== Construction phase ==
The project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike&#x27;s Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the Metropolitan Highway System. Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of Bechtel Corporation and Parsons Brinckerhoff. Because of the enormous size of the project—too large for any company to undertake alone—the design and construction of the Big Dig was broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included Jay Cashman, Modern Continental, Obayashi Corporation, Perini Corporation, Peter Kiewit Sons&#x27; Incorporated, J. F. White, and the Slattery division of Skanska USA. Of those, Modern Continental was awarded the greatest gross value of contracts, joint ventures included.
The nature of the Charles River crossing had been a source of major controversy throughout the design phase of the project. Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. With a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the Tobin Bridge to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as &quot;Scheme Z&quot;. This plan was considered to be reasonably cost-effective, but had the drawback of requiring highway ramps stacked up as high as immediately adjacent to the Charles River.

The city of Cambridge objected to the visual impact of the chosen Charles River crossing design. The city sued to revoke the project&#x27;s environmental certificate and forced the project planners to redesign the river crossing again.
Swiss engineer Christian Menn took over the design of the bridge. He suggested a cradle cable-stayed bridge that would carry ten lanes of traffic. The plan was accepted and construction began on the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge. The bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it. The distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders. It was the first bridge in the country to employ this method and it was, at the time, the widest cable-stayed bridge in the world, having since been surpassed by the Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.

Meanwhile, construction continued on the Tobin Bridge approach. By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector, today known as the &quot;City Square Tunnel&quot; for a Charlestown area it bypasses, was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the US Route 1 interchange and retrofitting the tunnel. 

Boston blue clay and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local landfills, fill in the Granite Rail Quarry in Quincy, and restore the surface of Spectacle Island in the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area.

The Storrow Drive Connector, a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to Storrow Drive in 1999. The project had been under consideration for years, but was opposed by the wealthy residents of the Beacon Hill neighborhood. It was finally accepted because it would funnel traffic bound for Storrow Drive and downtown Boston away from the mainline roadway. The Connector ultimately used a pair of ramps that had been constructed for Interstate 695, enabling the mainline I-93 to carry more traffic that would have used I-695 under the original Master Plan.

When construction began, the project cost, including the Charles River crossing, was estimated at $5.8 billion. Eventual cost overruns were so high that the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, James Kerasiotes, was fired in 2000. His replacement had to commit to an $8.55 billion cap on federal contributions. The total expenses eventually passed $15 billion. Interest brought this cost to $21.93 billion.

=== Engineering methods and details ===

Several unusual engineering challenges arose during the project, requiring unusual solutions and methods to address them. At the beginning of the project, engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above. Eventually, they created horizontal braces as wide as the tunnel, then cut away the elevated highway&#x27;s struts, and lowered it onto the new braces.

Three alternative construction methods were studied with their corresponding structural design to address existing conditions, safety measures, and constructability. In addition to codified loads, construction loads were computed to support final design and field execution.

== Final phases ==

On January 18, 2003, the opening ceremony was held for the I-90 Connector Tunnel, extending the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) east into the Ted Williams Tunnel, and onwards to Boston Logan International Airport. The Ted Williams tunnel had been completed and was in limited use for commercial traffic and high-occupancy vehicles since late 1995. The westbound lanes opened on the afternoon of January 18 and the eastbound lanes on January 19.

The next phase, moving the elevated Interstate 93 underground, was completed in two stages: northbound lanes opened on March 29, 2003, and southbound lanes (in a temporary configuration) on December 20, 2003. A tunnel underneath Leverett Circle connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19, 2004, easing congestion at the circle. All southbound lanes of I-93 opened to traffic on March 5, 2005, including the left lane of the Zakim Bridge, and all of the refurbished Dewey Square Tunnel.

By the end of December 2004, 95% of the Big Dig was completed. Major construction remained on the surface, including construction of final ramp configurations in the North End and in the South Bay interchange, and reconstruction of the surface streets.

The final ramp downtown—exit 16A (formerly 20B) from I-93 south to Albany Street—opened January 13, 2006.

In 2006, the two Interstate 93 tunnels were dedicated as the Thomas P. O&#x27;Neill Jr. Tunnel, after the former Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts who pushed to have the Big Dig funded by the federal government.

== Coordinated projects ==
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts was required under the Federal Clean Air Act to mitigate air pollution generated by the highway improvements. Secretary of Transportation Fred Salvucci signed an agreement with the Conservation Law Foundation in 1990 enumerating 14 specific projects the state agreed to build. This list was affirmed in a 1992 lawsuit settlement.

Projects which have been completed include:
* Restoration of three Old Colony Commuter Rail lines
* Expansion of Framingham Line to serve Worcester full-time
* Restoration of the Newburyport/Rockport Line
* Six-car trains on the MBTA Blue Line, requiring platform lengthening, station modernization, and all new train cars
* MBTA Silver Line, a bus rapid transit route to the South Boston waterfront and East Boston, including the airport
* 1,000 new commuter parking spaces
* Fairmount Line improvements
* Green Line Extension

However, some projects were removed:
* Design of the Red-Blue Connector
* Restoration of Green Line E branch service

=== Surface treatments ===
Some surface treatments that were part of the original project plan were dropped due to the massive cost overruns on the highway portion of the project.

$99.1 million was allocated for mitigating improvements to the Charles River Basin, including the construction of North Point Park in Cambridge and Paul Revere Park in Charlestown. The North Bank Bridge, providing pedestrian and bicycle connectivity between the parks, was not funded until the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Nashua Street Park on the Boston side was completed in 2003, by McCourt Construction with $7.9 million in funding from MassDOT.

As of 2017, $30.5 million had been transferred to the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation to complete five projects. Another incomplete but required project is the South Bank Bridge over the MBTA Commuter Rail tracks at North Station (connecting Nashua Street Park to the proposed South Bank Park, which is currently a parking lot under the Zakim Bridge at the Charles River locks).

Improvements in the lower Charles River Basin include the new walkway at Lovejoy Wharf (constructed by the developer of 160 North Washington Street, the new headquarters of Converse), the Lynch Family Skate Park (constructed in 2015 by the Charles River Conservancy), rehabilitation of historic operations buildings for the Charles River Dam and lock, a maintenance facility, and a planned pedestrian walkway across the Charles River next to the MBTA Commuter Rail drawbridge at North Station (connecting Nashua Street Park and North Point Park). MassDOT is funding the South Bank Park, and replacement of the North Washington Street Bridge (construction Aug 2018–23).

EF Education is funding public greenspace improvements as part of its three-phase expansion at North Point. Remaining funding may be used to construct the North Point Inlet pedestrian bridge, and a pedestrian walkway over Leverett Circle. Before being replaced with surface access during the reconstruction of the Science Park MBTA Green Line station, Leverett Circle had pedestrian bridges with stairs that provided elevated access between the station, the Charles River Parks, and the sidewalk to the Boston Museum of Science. The replacement ramps would comply with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements and allow easy travel by wheelchair or bicycle over the busy intersection.

=== Public art ===

While not a legally mandated requirement, public art was part of the urban design planning process, and later design development work, through the Artery Arts Program. The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.

At the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. Development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former West End houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near North Station by artist Sheila Levrant de Bretteville; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist Ross Miller in parcel 17; a historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder Donald McKay in East Boston; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the Miller&#x27;s River Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the Charles River.

Extensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings. 

== Impact on traffic ==

The Big Dig separated the co-mingled traffic from the Massachusetts Turnpike and the Sumner and Callahan tunnels. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north–south I-93, several new east–west lanes became available. East–west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.

The result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994–1995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004–2005, after the project was largely complete. The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004–2005 time frame. Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.

A 2008 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of demand induced by the increased road capacity. Because more drivers were opting to use the new roads, traffic bottlenecks were only pushed outward from the city, not reduced or eliminated (although some trips are now faster). The report states, &quot;Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic, not less.&quot; The &quot;Globe&quot; also asserted that their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a state-commissioned study done two years earlier, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs. That study did not look at highways outside the Big Dig construction area and did not take into account new congestion elsewhere.

== Impact on property values ==
Towards the end of the Big Dig in 2003, it was estimated that the demolition of the Central Artery highway would cause a $732 million increase in property value in Boston&#x27;s financial district, with the replacement parks providing an additional $252 million in value. As a result of the Big Dig, a large amount of waterfront space was opened up, which is now a high-rent residential and commercial area called the Seaport District. The development of Seaport alone was estimated to create $7 billion in private investment and 43,000 jobs.

== Operations Control Center (OCC) ==

As part of the project, an elaborate Operations Control Center (OCC) control room was constructed in South Boston. Staffed on a &quot;24/7/365&quot; basis, this center monitors and reports on traffic congestion, and responds to emergencies. Continuous video surveillance is provided by hundreds of cameras, and thousands of sensors monitor traffic speed and density, air quality, water levels, temperatures, equipment status, and other conditions inside the tunnel. The OCC can activate emergency ventilation fans, change electronic display signs, and dispatch service crews when necessary.

== Problems ==
=== Leaks ===
As far back as 2001, Turnpike Authority officials and contractors knew of thousands of leaks in ceiling and wall fissures, extensive water damage to steel supports and fireproofing systems, and overloaded drainage systems. Many of the leaks were a result of Modern Continental and other subcontractors failing to remove gravel and other debris before pouring concrete. This information was not made public until engineers at MIT (volunteer students and professors) performed several experiments and found serious problems with the tunnel.

On September 15, 2004, a major leak in the Interstate 93 north tunnel forced the closure of the tunnel while repairs were conducted. This also forced the Turnpike Authority to release information regarding its non-disclosure of prior leaks. A follow-up reported on &quot;extensive&quot; leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged. The report went on to state that the tunnel system had more than 400 leaks. A &quot;Boston Globe&quot; report countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single section of tunnel beneath South Station. Turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1,000 to 500.

The problem of leaks is further aggravated by the fact that many of them involve corrosive salt water. This is caused by the proximity of Boston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean, causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by road salt spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through. Salt water and salt spray are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any marine environment. It has been reported that &quot;hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly&quot; in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing &quot;hot spots&quot; where water leakage is especially serious. Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused ceiling light fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded rebar and other structural steel reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.

=== Substandard materials ===
Massachusetts State Police searched the offices of Aggregate Industries, the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the project, in June 2005. They seized evidence that Aggregate delivered concrete that did not meet contract specifications. In March 2006 Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly announced plans to sue project contractors and others because of poor work on the project. Over 200 complaints were filed by the state of Massachusetts as a result of leaks, cost overruns, quality concerns, and safety violations. In total, the state has sought approximately $100 million from the contractors ($1 for every $141 spent).

In May 2006, six employees of the company were arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. The employees were accused of reusing old concrete and double-billing loads. In July 2007, Aggregate Industries settled the case with an agreement to pay $50 million. $42 million of the settlement went to civil cases and $8 million was paid in criminal fines. The company will provide $75 million in insurance for maintenance as well as pay $500,000 toward routine checks on areas suspected to contain substandard concrete.

In July 2009, two of the accused, Gerard McNally and Keith Thomas, both managers, pled guilty to charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, and filing false reports. The following month, the remaining four, Robert Prosperi, Mark Blais, Gregory Stevenson, and John Farrar, were found guilty on conspiracy and fraud charges. The four were sentenced to probation and home confinement and Blais and Farrar were additionally sentenced to community service.

=== Fatal ceiling collapse ===

A fatal accident raised safety questions and closed part of the project for most of the summer of 2006. On July 10, 2006, concrete ceiling panels and debris weighing and measuring fell on a car traveling on the two-lane ramp connecting northbound I-93 to eastbound I-90 in South Boston, killing Milena Del Valle, who was a passenger, and injuring her husband, Angel Del Valle, who was driving.

Immediately following the fatal ceiling collapse, Governor Mitt Romney ordered a &quot;stem-to-stern&quot; safety audit conducted by the engineering firm of Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. to look for additional areas of risk. Said Romney: &quot;We simply cannot live in a setting where a project of this scale has the potential of threatening human life, as has already been seen&quot;.

The collapse and closure of the tunnel greatly snarled traffic in the city. The resulting traffic jams are cited as contributing to the death of another person, a heart attack victim who died en route to Boston Medical Center when his ambulance was caught in one such traffic jam two weeks after the collapse. On September 1, 2006, one eastbound lane of the connector tunnel was re-opened to traffic.

Following extensive inspections and repairs, Interstate 90 east- and westbound lanes reopened in early January 2007. The final piece of the road network, a high occupancy vehicle lane connecting Interstate 93 north to the Ted Williams Tunnel, reopened on June 1, 2007.

On July 10, 2007, after a lengthy investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board found that epoxy glue used to hold the roof in place during construction was not appropriate for long-term bonding. This was determined to be the cause of the roof collapse. The Power-Fast Epoxy Adhesive used in the installation was designed for short-term loading, such as wind or earthquake loads, not long-term loading, such as the weight of a panel.

Powers Fasteners, the makers of the adhesive, revised their product specifications on May 15, 2007, to increase the safety factor from 4 to 10 for all of their epoxy products intended for use in overhead applications. The safety factor on Power-Fast Epoxy was increased from 4 to 16. On December 24, 2007, the Del Valle family announced they had reached a settlement with Powers Fasteners that would pay the family $6 million. In December 2008, Powers Fasteners agreed to pay $16 million to the state to settle manslaughter charges.

=== &quot;Ginsu guardrails&quot; ===
Public safety workers have called the walkway safety handrails in the Big Dig tunnels &quot;ginsu guardrails&quot;, because the squared-off edges of the support posts have caused mutilations and deaths of passengers ejected from crashed vehicles. After an eighth reported death involving the safety handrails, MassDOT officials announced plans to cover or remove the allegedly dangerous fixtures, but only near curves or exit ramps. This partial removal of hazards has been criticized by a safety specialist, who suggests that the handrails are just as dangerous in straight sections of the tunnel.

=== Lighting fixtures ===
In March 2011, it became known that senior MassDOT officials had failed to disclose an issue with the lighting fixtures in the O&#x27;Neill tunnel. In early February 2011, a maintenance crew found a fixture lying in the middle travel lane in the northbound tunnel. Assuming it to be simple road debris, the maintenance team picked it up and brought it back to its home facility. The next day, a supervisor passing through the yard realized that the fixture was not road debris but was in fact one of the fixtures used to light the tunnel itself. Further investigation revealed that the fixture&#x27;s mounting apparatus had failed, due to galvanic corrosion of incompatible metals, caused by having aluminum in direct contact with stainless steel, in the presence of salt water. The electrochemical potential difference between stainless steel and aluminum is in the range of 0.5 to 1.0V, depending on the exact alloys involved, and can cause considerable corrosion within months under unfavorable conditions.

After the discovery of the reason why the fixture had failed, a comprehensive inspection of the other fixtures in the tunnel revealed that numerous other fixtures were also in the same state of deterioration. Some of the worst fixtures were temporarily shored up with plastic ties. Moving forward with temporary repairs, members of the MassDOT administration team decided not to let the news of the systemic failure and repair of the fixtures be released to the public or to Governor Deval Patrick&#x27;s administration.

, it appeared that all of the 25,000 light fixtures would have to be replaced, at an estimated cost of $54 million. The replacement work was mostly done at night, and required lane closures or occasional closing of the entire tunnel for safety, and was estimated to take up to two years to complete.

<doc id="4319" wikidata="Q161953" url="?curid=4319" title="Books of Chronicles">
<text>The Book of Chronicles ( , &quot;words of the days&quot;) is a book in the Hebrew Bible, found as two books (1–2 Chronicles) in the Christian Old Testament. Chronicles is the final book of the Hebrew Bible, concluding the third section of the Jewish Tanakh, the Ketuvim (&quot;Writings&quot;). It contains a genealogy starting with Adam and a history of ancient Judah and Israel up to the Edict of Cyrus in 539 BC.

The book was translated into Greek and divided into two books in the Septuagint in the mid-3rd century BC. In Christian contexts Chronicles is referred to in the plural as the Books of Chronicles, after the Latin name given to the text by Jerome, but is also referred to by its Greek name as the Books of Paralipomenon. In Christian Bibles, they usually follow the two Books of Kings and precede Ezra–Nehemiah, the last history-oriented book of the Protestant Old Testament.

==Summary==

The Chronicles narrative begins with Adam, Seth and Enosh, and the story is then carried forward, almost entirely through genealogical lists, down to the founding of the United Kingdom of Israel in the &quot;introductory chapters&quot;, 1 Chronicles 1–9. The bulk of the remainder of 1 Chronicles, after a brief account of Saul in chapter 10, is concerned with the reign of David. The next long section concerns David&#x27;s son Solomon, and the final part is concerned with the Kingdom of Judah, with occasional references to the northern Kingdom of Israel (2 Chronicles 10–36). The final chapter covers briefly the reigns of the last four kings, until Judah is destroyed and the people taken into exile in Babylon. In the two final verses, identical to the opening verses of the Book of Ezra, the Persian king Cyrus the Great conquers the Neo-Babylonian Empire, and authorises the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the return of the exiles.
==Structure==

Originally a single work, Chronicles was divided into two in the Septuagint, a Greek translation produced in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. It has three broad divisions: 
# the genealogies in chapters 1–9 of 1 Chronicles
# the reigns of David and Solomon (constituting the remainder of 1 Chronicles, and chapters 1–9 of 2 Chronicles); and 
# the narrative of the divided kingdom, focusing on the Kingdom of Judah, in the remainder of 2 Chronicles.

Within this broad structure there are signs that the author has used various other devices to structure his work, notably through drawing parallels between David and Solomon (the first becomes king, establishes the worship of Israel&#x27;s God in Jerusalem, and fights the wars that will enable the Temple to be built, then Solomon becomes king, builds and dedicates the Temple, and reaps the benefits of prosperity and peace).

1 Chronicles is divided into 29 chapters and 2 Chronicles into 36 chapters. Biblical commentator C. J. Ball suggests that the division into two books introduced by the translators of the Septuagint &quot;occurs in the most suitable place&quot;, namely with the conclusion of David&#x27;s reign as king and the initiation of Solomon&#x27;s reign.

The Talmud considered Chronicles one book.

==Composition==

===Origins===
The last events recorded in Chronicles take place in the reign of Cyrus the Great, the Persian king who conquered Babylon in 539 BC; this sets the earliest possible date for this passage of the book.

Chronicles appears to be largely the work of a single individual. The writer was probably male, probably a Levite (temple priest), and probably from Jerusalem. He was well-read, a skilled editor, and a sophisticated theologian. He aimed to use the narratives in the Torah and former prophets to convey religious messages to his peers, the literary and political elite of Jerusalem in the time of the Achaemenid Empire.

Jewish and Christian tradition identified this author as the 5th-century BC figure Ezra, who gives his name to the Book of Ezra; Ezra is also believed by the Talmudic sages to have written both his own book (i. e., Ezra–Nehemiah) and Chronicles up to his own time, the latter having been finished by Nehemiah. Later critics, skeptical of the long-maintained tradition, preferred to call the author &quot;the Chronicler&quot;. However, many scholars maintain support for Ezra&#x27;s authorship, not only based on centuries of work by Jewish historians, but also due to the consistency of language and speech patterns between Chronicles and Ezra–Nehemiah. Professor Emeritus Menahem Haran of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem explains, &quot;the overall unity of the Chronistic Work is … demonstrated by a common ideology, the uniformity of legal, cultic and historical conceptions and specific style, all of which reflect one opus.&quot;

One of the most striking, although inconclusive, features of Chronicles is that its closing sentence is repeated as the opening of Ezra–Nehemiah. In antiquity, such repeated verses, like the &quot;catch-lines&quot; used by modern printers, often appeared at the end of a scroll to facilitate the reader&#x27;s passing on to the correct second book-scroll after completing the first. This scribal device was employed in works that exceeded the scope of a single scroll and had to be continued on another scroll.

The latter half of the 20th century, amid growing skepticism in academia regarding history in the Biblical tradition, saw a reappraisal of the authorship question. Though there is a general lack of corroborating evidence, many now regard it as improbable that the author of Chronicles was also the author of the narrative portions of Ezra–Nehemiah. These critics suggest that &quot;Chronicles&quot; was probably composed between 400 and 250 BC, with the period 350–300 BC the most likely. This timeframe is achieved by estimates made based on genealogies appearing in the Greek Septuagint. This theory bases its premise on the latest person mentioned in Chronicles, Anani. Anani is an eighth-generation descendant of King Jehoiachin according to the Masoretic Text. This has persuaded many supporters of the Septuagint&#x27;s reading to place Anani&#x27;s likely date of birth a century later than what had been largely accepted for two millennia.

===Sources===
Much of the content of Chronicles is a repetition of material from other books of the Bible, from Genesis to Kings, and so the usual scholarly view is that these books, or an early version of them, provided the author with the bulk of his material. It is, however, possible that the situation was rather more complex, and that books such as Genesis and Samuel should be regarded as contemporary with Chronicles, drawing on much of the same material, rather than a source for it. Despite much discussion of this issue, no agreement has been reached. It is also likely that Chronicles preserved ancient heterodox traditions regarding Israel&#x27;s history.

=== Genre ===
The translators who created the Greek version of the Jewish Bible (the Septuagint) called this book &quot;Paralipomenon&quot;, &quot;Things Left Out&quot;, indicating that they thought of it as a supplement to another work, probably Genesis–Kings, but the idea seems inappropriate, since much of Genesis–Kings has been copied almost without change. Some modern scholars proposed that Chronicles is a midrash, or traditional Jewish commentary, on Genesis–Kings, but again this is not entirely accurate since the author or authors do not comment on the older books so much as use them to create a new work. Recent suggestions have been that it was intended as a clarification of the history in Genesis–Kings, or a replacement or alternative for it.

==Themes==
Presbyterian theologian Paul K. Hooker argues that the generally accepted message the author wished to give to his audience was a theological reflection, not a &quot;history of Israel&quot;:
# God is active in history, and especially the history of Israel. The faithfulness or sins of individual kings are immediately rewarded or punished by God. (This is in contrast to the theology of the Books of Kings, where the faithlessness of kings was punished on later generations through the Babylonian exile). 
# God calls Israel to a special relationship. The call begins with the genealogies, gradually narrowing the focus from all mankind to a single family, the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob. &quot;True&quot; Israel is those who continue to worship Yahweh at the Temple in Jerusalem (in the southern Kingdom of Judah), with the result that the history of the historical Kingdom of Israel is almost completely ignored. 
# God chose David and his dynasty as the agents of his will. According to the author of Chronicles, the three great events of David&#x27;s reign were his bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, his founding of an eternal royal dynasty, and his preparations for the construction of the Temple. 
# God chose a site in Jerusalem as the location for the Temple, the place where God should be worshiped. More time and space are spent on the construction of the Temple and its rituals of worship than on any other subject. By stressing the central role of the Temple in pre-exilic Judah, the author also stresses the importance of the newly rebuilt Persian-era Second Temple to his own readers.
# God remains active in Israel. The past is used to legitimize the author&#x27;s present: this is seen most clearly in the detailed attention he gives to the Temple built by Solomon, but also in the genealogy and lineages, which connect his own generation to the distant past and thus make the claim that the present is a continuation of that past.

<text>In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node&#x27;s left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree. The time complexity of operations on the binary search tree is linear with respect to the height of the tree.

Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, addition, and removal of data items. Since the nodes in a BST are laid out so that each comparison skips about half of the remaining tree, the lookup performance is proportional to that of binary logarithm. BSTs were devised in the 1960s for the problem of efficient storage of labeled data and are attributed to Conway Berners-Lee and David Wheeler.

The performance of a binary search tree is dependent on the order of insertion of the nodes into the tree since arbitrary insertions may lead to degeneracy; several variations of the binary search tree can be built with guaranteed worst-case performance. The basic operations include: search, traversal, insert and delete. BSTs with guaranteed worst-case complexities perform better than an unsorted array, which would require linear search time.

The complexity analysis of BST shows that, on average, the insert, delete and search takes formula_1 for formula_2 nodes. In the worst case, they degrade to that of a singly linked list: formula_3. To address the boundless increase of the tree height with arbitrary insertions and deletions, self-balancing variants of BSTs are introduced to bound the worst lookup complexity to that of the binary logarithm. AVL trees were the first self-balancing binary search trees, invented in 1962 by Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis.

Binary search trees can be used to implement abstract data types such as dynamic sets, lookup tables and priority queues, and used in sorting algorithms such as tree sort.

==History==
The binary search tree algorithm was discovered independently by several researchers, including P.F. Windley, Andrew Donald Booth, Andrew Colin, Thomas N. Hibbard. The algorithm is attributed to Conway Berners-Lee and David Wheeler, who used it for storing labeled data in magnetic tapes in 1960. One of the earliest and popular binary search tree algorithm is that of Hibbard.

The time complexities of a binary search tree increases boundlessly with the tree height if the nodes are inserted in an arbitrary order, therefore self-balancing binary search trees were introduced to bound the height of the tree to formula_1. Various height-balanced binary search trees were introduced to confine the tree height, such as AVL trees, Treaps, and red–black trees. 

The AVL tree was invented by Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis in 1962 for the efficient organization of information. It was the first self-balancing binary search tree to be invented.

==Overview==
A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree in which nodes are arranged in strict total order in which the nodes with keys greater than any particular node &quot;A&quot; is stored on the right sub-trees to that node &quot;A&quot; and the nodes with keys equal to or less than &quot;A&quot; are stored on the left sub-trees to &quot;A,&quot; satisfying the binary search property.

Binary search trees are also efficacious in sortings and search algorithms. However, the search complexity of a BST depends upon the order in which the nodes are inserted and deleted; since in worst case, successive operations in the binary search tree may lead to degeneracy and form a singly linked list (or &quot;unbalanced tree&quot;) like structure, thus has the same worst-case complexity as a linked list. 

Binary search trees are also a fundamental data structure used in construction of abstract data structures such as sets, multisets, and associative arrays.

==Operations==
===Searching===
Searching in a binary search tree for a specific key can be programmed recursively or iteratively.

Searching begins by examining the root node. If the tree is , the key being searched for does not exist in the tree. Otherwise, if the key equals that of the root, the search is successful and the node is returned. If the key is less than that of the root, the search proceeds by examining the left subtree. Similarly, if the key is greater than that of the root, the search proceeds by examining the right subtree. This process is repeated until the key is found or the remaining subtree is formula_5. If the searched key is not found after a formula_5 subtree is reached, then the key is not present in the tree.

====Recursive search====
The following pseudocode implements the BST search procedure through recursion.

The recursive procedure continues until a formula_5 or the formula_8 being searched for are encountered.

====Iterative search====
The recursive version of the search can be &quot;unrolled&quot; into a while loop. On most machines, the iterative version is found to be more efficient.

Since the search may proceed till some leaf node, the running time complexity of BST search is formula_9 where formula_10 is the height of the tree. However, the worst case for BST search is formula_3 where formula_2 is the total number of nodes in the BST, because an unbalanced BST may degenerate to a linked list. However, if the BST is height-balanced the height is formula_1.

====Successor and predecessor====
For certain operations, given a node formula_14, finding the successor or predecessor of formula_14 is crucial. Assuming all the keys of a BST are distinct, the successor of a node formula_14 in a BST is the node with the smallest key greater than formula_14&#x27;s key. On the other hand, the predecessor of a node formula_14 in a BST is the node with the largest key smaller than formula_14&#x27;s key. The following pseudocode finds the successor and predecessor of a node formula_14 in a BST.

Operations such as finding a node in a BST whose key is the maximum or minimum are critical in certain operations, such as determining the successor and predecessor of nodes. Following is the pseudocode for the operations.
===Insertion===
Operations such as insertion and deletion cause the BST representation to change dynamically. The data structure must be modified in such a way that the properties of BST continue to hold. New nodes are inserted as leaf nodes in the BST. Following is an iterative implementation of the insertion operation.

The procedure maintains a &quot;trailing pointer&quot; formula_21 as a parent of formula_14. After initialization on line 2, the while loop along lines 4-11 causes the pointers to be updated. If formula_21 is formula_5, the BST is empty, thus formula_25 is inserted as the root node of the binary search tree formula_26, if it is not formula_5, insertion proceeds by comparing the keys to that of formula_21 on the lines 15-19 and the node is inserted accordingly.

===Deletion===

The deletion of a node, say formula_29, from the binary search tree formula_30 has three cases:
# If formula_29 is a leaf node, it is replaced by formula_32 as shown in (a).
# If formula_29 has only one child, the child node of formula_29 gets elevated by modifying the parent node of formula_29 to point to the child node, consequently taking formula_29&#x27;s position in the tree, as shown in (b) and (c).
# If formula_29 has both left and right children, the successor of formula_29, say formula_39, displaces formula_29 by following the two cases:
## If formula_39 is formula_29&#x27;s right child, as shown in (d), formula_39 displaces formula_29 and formula_39&#x27;s right child remain unchanged.
## If formula_39 lies within formula_29&#x27;s right subtree but is not formula_29&#x27;s right child, as shown in (e), formula_39 first gets replaced by its own right child, and then it displaces formula_29&#x27;s position in the tree.

The following pseudocode implements the deletion operation in a binary search tree.

The formula_51 procedure deals with the 3 special cases mentioned above. Lines 2-3 deal with case 1; lines 4-5 deal with case 2 and lines 6-16 for case 3. The helper function formula_52 is used within the deletion algorithm for the purpose of replacing the node formula_53 with formula_54 in the binary search tree formula_30. This procedure handles the deletion (and substitution) of formula_53 from formula_30.

==Traversal==
A BST can be traversed through three basic algorithms: inorder, preorder, and postorder tree walks.
*Inorder tree walk: Nodes from the left subtree get visited first, followed by the root node and right subtree. Such a traversal visits all the nodes in the order of non-decreasing key sequence.
*Preorder tree walk: The root node gets visited first, followed by left and right subtrees.
*Postorder tree walk: Nodes from the left subtree get visited first, followed by the right subtree, and finally, the root.

Following is a recursive implementation of the tree walks.
==Balanced binary search trees==

Without rebalancing, insertions or deletions in a binary search tree may lead to degeneration, resulting in a height formula_2 of the tree (where formula_2 is number of items in a tree), so that the lookup performance is deteriorated to that of a linear search. Keeping the search tree balanced and height bounded by formula_1 is a key to the usefulness of the binary search tree. This can be achieved by &quot;self-balancing&quot; mechanisms during the updation operations to the tree designed to maintain the tree height to the binary logarithmic complexity.

=== Height-balanced trees ===
A tree is height-balanced if the heights of the left sub-tree and right sub-tree are guaranteed to be related by a constant factor. This property was introduced by the AVL tree and continued by the red–black tree. The heights of all the nodes on the path from the root to the modified leaf node have to be observed and possibly corrected on every insert and delete operation to the tree.

=== Weight-balanced trees ===

In a weight-balanced tree, the criterion of a balanced tree is the number of leaves of the subtrees. The weights of the left and right subtrees differ at most by formula_61. However, the difference is bound by a ratio formula_62 of the weights, since a strong balance condition of formula_61 cannot be maintained with formula_1 rebalancing work during insert and delete operations. The formula_62-weight-balanced trees gives an entire family of balance conditions, where each left and right subtrees have each at least a fraction of formula_62 of the total weight of the subtree.

=== Types ===
There are several self-balanced binary search trees, including T-tree, treap, red-black tree, B-tree, 2–3 tree, and Splay tree.

==Examples of applications==
===Sort===

Binary search trees are used in sorting algorithms such as tree sort, where all the elements are inserted at once and the tree is traversed at an in-order fashion. BSTs are also used in quicksort.

===Priority queue operations===

Binary search trees are used in implementing priority queues, using the node&#x27;s key as priorities. Adding new elements to the queue follows the regular BST insertion operation but the removal operation depends on the type of priority queue:
* If it is an ascending order priority queue, removal of an element with the lowest priority is done through leftward traversal of the BST.
* If it is a descending order priority queue, removal of an element with the highest priority is done through rightward traversal of the BST.

<text>In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the &quot;left child&quot; and the &quot;right child&quot;. That is, it is a &quot;k&quot;-ary tree with . A recursive definition using set theory is that a binary tree is a tuple (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;R&quot;), where &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot; are binary trees or the empty set and &quot;S&quot; is a singleton set containing the root.

From a graph theory perspective, binary trees as defined here are arborescences. A binary tree may thus be also called a bifurcating arborescence, a term which appears in some early programming books before the modern computer science terminology prevailed. It is also possible to interpret a binary tree as an undirected, rather than directed graph, in which case a binary tree is an ordered, rooted tree. Some authors use rooted binary tree instead of &quot;binary tree&quot; to emphasize the fact that the tree is rooted, but as defined above, a binary tree is always rooted.

In mathematics, what is termed &quot;binary tree&quot; can vary significantly from author to author. Some use the definition commonly used in computer science, but others define it as every non-leaf having exactly two children and don&#x27;t necessarily label the children as left and right either.

In computing, binary trees can be used in two very different ways:

*First, as a means of accessing nodes based on some value or label associated with each node. Binary trees labelled this way are used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps, and are used for efficient searching and sorting. The designation of non-root nodes as left or right child even when there is only one child present matters in some of these applications, in particular, it is significant in binary search trees. However, the arrangement of particular nodes into the tree is not part of the conceptual information. For example, in a normal binary search tree the placement of nodes depends almost entirely on the order in which they were added, and can be re-arranged (for example by balancing) without changing the meaning.
*Second, as a representation of data with a relevant bifurcating structure. In such cases, the particular arrangement of nodes under and/or to the left or right of other nodes is part of the information (that is, changing it would change the meaning). Common examples occur with Huffman coding and cladograms. The everyday division of documents into chapters, sections, paragraphs, and so on is an analogous example with &quot;n&quot;-ary rather than binary trees.

== Definitions ==

=== Recursive definition ===

To define a binary tree, the possibility that only one of the children may be empty must be acknowledged. An artifact, which in some textbooks is called an &quot;extended binary tree,&quot; is needed for that purpose. An extended binary tree is thus recursively defined as:
* the empty set is an extended binary tree
* if T1 and T2 are extended binary trees, then denote by T1 • T2 the extended binary tree obtained by by adding edges when these sub-trees are non-empty.

Another way of imagining this construction (and understanding the terminology) is to consider instead of the empty set a different type of node—for instance square nodes if the regular ones are circles.

=== Using graph theory concepts ===
A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root); thus, for every node, a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below. Ordering of these children (e.g., by drawing them on a plane) makes it possible to distinguish a left child from a right child. But this still does not distinguish between a node with left but not a right child from a node with right but no left child.

The necessary distinction can be made by first partitioning the edges; i.e., defining the binary tree as triplet (V, E1, E2), where (V, E1 ∪ E2) is a rooted tree (equivalently arborescence) and E1 ∩ E2 is empty, and also requiring that for all &quot;j&quot; ∈ { 1, 2 }, every node has at most one E&quot;j&quot; child. A more informal way of making the distinction is to say, quoting the Encyclopedia of Mathematics, that &quot;every node has a left child, a right child, neither, or both&quot; and to specify that these &quot;are all different&quot; binary trees.

== Types of binary trees ==
Tree terminology is not well-standardized and so varies in literatures.
* A binary tree has a root node and every node has at most two children.
* A binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper, plane, or strict binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. Another way of defining a full binary tree is a recursive definition. A full binary tree is either:
** A single vertex (a single node as the root node).
** A tree whose root node has two subtrees, both of which are full binary trees.
* A binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children &quot;and&quot; all leaves have the same &quot;depth&quot; or same &quot;level&quot; (the level of a node defined as the number of edges or links from the root node to a node). A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree.
* A binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, &quot;except possibly the last&quot;, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2&quot;h&quot; nodes at the last level &quot;h&quot;. A perfect tree is therefore always complete but a complete tree is not always perfect. Some authors use the term complete to refer instead to a perfect binary tree as defined above, in which case they call this type of tree (with a possibly not filled last level) an almost complete binary tree or nearly complete binary tree. A complete binary tree can be efficiently represented using an array.

* The infinite complete binary tree is a tree with formula_1 levels, where for each level &quot;d&quot; the number of existing nodes at level d is equal to 2&quot;d&quot;. The cardinal number of the set of all levels is formula_1 (countably infinite). The cardinal number of the set of all paths (the &quot;leaves&quot;, so to speak) is uncountable, having the cardinality of the continuum.
* A balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height (the number of edges from the top-most node to the farthest node in a subtree) by no more than 1 (or the skew is no greater than 1). One may also consider binary trees where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf. (Different balancing schemes allow different definitions of &quot;much farther&quot;.)
* A degenerate (or pathological) tree is where each parent node has only one associated child node. This means that the tree will behave like a linked list data structure. In this case, an advantage of using a binary tree is significantly reduced because it is essentially a linked list which time complexity is O(&quot;n&quot;) (&quot;n&quot; as the number of nodes) and it has more data space than the linked list due to two pointers per node, while the complexity of O(log2&quot;n&quot;) for data search in a balanced binary tree is normally expected.

== Properties of binary trees ==
* The number of nodes formula_3 in a full binary tree is at least formula_4 and at most formula_5 (i.e., the number of nodes in a perfect binary tree), where formula_6 is the height of the tree. A tree consisting of only a root node has a height of 0. The least number of nodes is obtained by adding only two children nodes per adding height so formula_4 (1 for counting the root node). The maximum number of nodes is obtained by fully filling nodes at each level, i.e., it is a perfect tree. For a perfect tree, the number of nodes is formula_8, where the last equality is from the geometric series sum.
* The number of leaf nodes formula_9 in a perfect binary tree is formula_10 (where formula_3 is the number of nodes in the tree) because formula_12 (by using the above property) and the number of leaves is formula_13 so formula_14. It also means that formula_15. In terms of the tree height formula_16, formula_17.
* For any non-empty binary tree with formula_18 leaf nodes and formula_19 nodes of degree 2 (internal nodes with two child nodes), formula_20. The proof is the following. For a perfect binary tree, the total number of nodes is formula_21 (A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree.) and formula_22, so formula_23. To make a full binary tree from a perfect binary tree, a pair of two sibling nodes are removed one by one. This results in &quot;two leaf nodes removed&quot; and &quot;one internal node removed&quot; and &quot;the removed internal node becoming a leaf node&quot;, so one leaf node and one internal node is removed per removing two sibling nodes. As a result, formula_24 also holds for a full binary tree. To make a binary tree with a leaf node without its sibling, a single leaf node is removed from a full binary tree, then &quot;one leaf node removed&quot; and &quot;one internal nodes with two children removed&quot; so formula_24 also holds. This relation now covers all non-empty binary trees.
* With given formula_26 nodes, the minimum possible tree height is formula_27 with which the tree is a balanced full tree or perfect tree. With a given height formula_6, the number of nodes can&#x27;t exceed the formula_5 as the number of nodes in a perfect tree. Thus formula_30.
* A binary Tree with formula_9 leaves has at least the height formula_32. With a given height formula_6, the number of leaves at that height can&#x27;t exceed formula_13 as the number of leaves at the height in a perfect tree. Thus formula_35.
* In a non-empty binary tree, if formula_3 is the total number of nodes and formula_37 is the total number of edges, then formula_38. This is obvious because each node requires one edge except for the root node.
* The number of null links (i.e., absent children of the nodes) in a binary tree of &quot;n&quot; nodes is (&quot;n&quot; + 1).
* The number of internal nodes in a complete binary tree of &quot;n&quot; nodes is formula_39.

== Combinatorics ==

In combinatorics, one considers the problem of counting the number of full binary trees of a given size. Here the trees have no values attached to their nodes (this would just multiply the number of possible trees by an easily determined factor), and trees are distinguished only by their structure; however, the left and right child of any node are distinguished (if they are different trees, then interchanging them will produce a tree distinct from the original one). The size of the tree is taken to be the number &quot;n&quot; of internal nodes (those with two children); the other nodes are leaf nodes and there are of them. The number of such binary trees of size &quot;n&quot; is equal to the number of ways of fully parenthesizing a string of symbols (representing leaves) separated by &quot;n&quot; binary operators (representing internal nodes), to determine the argument subexpressions of each operator. For instance for one has to parenthesize a string like , which is possible in five ways:
: formula_40
The correspondence to binary trees should be obvious, and the addition of redundant parentheses (around an already parenthesized expression or around the full expression) is disallowed (or at least not counted as producing a new possibility).

There is a unique binary tree of size 0 (consisting of a single leaf), and any other binary tree is characterized by the pair of its left and right children; if these have sizes &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; respectively, the full tree has size . Therefore, the number formula_41 of binary trees of size &quot;n&quot; has the following recursive description formula_42, and formula_43 for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;. It follows that formula_41 is the Catalan number of index &quot;n&quot;.

The above parenthesized strings should not be confused with the set of words of length 2&quot;n&quot; in the Dyck language, which consist only of parentheses in such a way that they are properly balanced. The number of such strings satisfies the same recursive description (each Dyck word of length 2&quot;n&quot; is determined by the Dyck subword enclosed by the initial &#x27;(&#x27; and its matching &#x27;)&#x27; together with the Dyck subword remaining after that closing parenthesis, whose lengths 2&quot;i&quot; and 2&quot;j&quot; satisfy ); this number is therefore also the Catalan number formula_41. So there are also five Dyck words of length 6:

These Dyck words do not correspond to binary trees in the same way. Instead, they are related by the following recursively defined bijection: the Dyck word equal to the empty string corresponds to the binary tree of size 0 with only one leaf. Any other Dyck word can be written as (formula_46)formula_47, where formula_46,formula_47 are themselves (possibly empty) Dyck words and where the two written parentheses are matched. The bijection is then defined by letting the words formula_46 and formula_47 correspond to the binary trees that are the left and right children of the root.

A bijective correspondence can also be defined as follows: enclose the Dyck word in an extra pair of parentheses, so that the result can be interpreted as a Lisp list expression (with the empty list () as only occurring atom); then the dotted-pair expression for that proper list is a fully parenthesized expression (with NIL as symbol and &#x27;.&#x27; as operator) describing the corresponding binary tree (which is, in fact, the internal representation of the proper list).

The ability to represent binary trees as strings of symbols and parentheses implies that binary trees can represent the elements of a free magma on a singleton set.

== Methods for storing binary trees ==
Binary trees can be constructed from programming language primitives in several ways.

=== Nodes and references ===

In a language with records and references, binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child. Sometimes it also contains a reference to its unique parent. If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special sentinel node.

This method of storing binary trees wastes a fair bit of memory, as the pointers will be null (or point to the sentinel) more than half the time; a more conservative representation alternative is threaded binary tree.

In languages with tagged unions such as ML, a tree node is often a tagged union of two types of nodes, one of which is a 3-tuple of data, left child, and right child, and the other of which is a &quot;leaf&quot; node, which contains no data and functions much like the null value in a language with pointers. For example, the following line of code in OCaml (an ML dialect) defines a binary tree that stores a character in each node.

type chr_tree = Empty | Node of char * chr_tree * chr_tree
=== Arrays ===

Binary trees can also be stored in breadth-first order as an implicit data structure in arrays, and if the tree is a complete binary tree, this method wastes no space. In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index &quot;i&quot;, its children are found at indices formula_52 (for the left child) and formula_53 (for the right), while its parent (if any) is found at index &quot;formula_54&quot; (assuming the root has index zero). Alternatively, with a 1-indexed array, the implementation is simplified with children found at formula_55 and formula_56, and parent found at formula_57.

This method benefits from more compact storage and better locality of reference, particularly during a preorder traversal. It is often used for binary heaps.

== Encodings ==

=== Succinct encodings ===
A succinct data structure is one which occupies close to minimum possible space, as established by information theoretical lower bounds. The number of different binary trees on formula_3 nodes is formula_59, the formula_3th Catalan number (assuming we view trees with identical &quot;structure&quot; as identical). For large formula_3, this is about formula_62; thus we need at least about formula_63 bits to encode it. A succinct binary tree therefore would occupy formula_64 bits.

One simple representation which meets this bound is to visit the nodes of the tree in preorder, outputting &quot;1&quot; for an internal node and &quot;0&quot; for a leaf. If the tree contains data, we can simply simultaneously store it in a consecutive array in preorder. This function accomplishes this:

 function EncodeSuccinct(&quot;node&quot; n, &quot;bitstring&quot; structure, &quot;array&quot; data) {
 if n = &quot;nil&quot; then
 append 0 to structure;
 else
 append 1 to structure;
 append n.data to data;
 EncodeSuccinct(n.left, structure, data);
 EncodeSuccinct(n.right, structure, data);

The string &quot;structure&quot; has only formula_65 bits in the end, where formula_3 is the number of (internal) nodes; we don&#x27;t even have to store its length. To show that no information is lost, we can convert the output back to the original tree like this:

 function DecodeSuccinct(&quot;bitstring&quot; structure, &quot;array&quot; data) {
 remove first bit of &quot;structure&quot; and put it in &quot;b&quot;
 if b = 1 then
 create a new node &quot;n&quot;
 remove first element of data and put it in n.data
 n.left = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)
 n.right = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)
 return n
 else
 return nil

More sophisticated succinct representations allow not only compact storage of trees but even useful operations on those trees directly while they&#x27;re still in their succinct form.

=== Encoding ordered trees as binary trees ===
There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between ordered trees and binary trees. It allows any ordered tree to be uniquely represented as a binary tree, and vice versa:

Let &quot;T&quot; be a node of an ordered tree, and let &quot;B&quot; denote &quot;T&#x27;s&quot; image in the corresponding binary tree. Then &quot;B&#x27;s&quot; &quot;left&quot; child represents &quot;T&#x27;s&quot; first child, while the &quot;B&#x27;s right&quot; child represents &quot;T&quot;&#x27;s next sibling. 

For example, the ordered tree on the left and the binary tree on the right correspond:

In the pictured binary tree, the black, left, edges represent &quot;first child&quot;, while the blue, right, edges represent &quot;next sibling&quot;.

This representation is called a left-child right-sibling binary tree.

== Common operations ==

There are a variety of different operations that can be performed on binary trees. Some are mutator operations, while others simply return useful information about the tree.

=== Insertion ===
Nodes can be inserted into binary trees in between two other nodes or added after a leaf node. In binary trees, a node that is inserted is specified as to whose child it will be.

==== Leaf nodes ====
To add a new node after leaf node A, A assigns the new node as one of its children and the new node assigns node A as its parent.

==== Internal nodes ====

Insertion on internal nodes is slightly more complex than on leaf nodes. Say that the internal node is node A and that node B is the child of A. (If the insertion is to insert a right child, then B is the right child of A, and similarly with a left child insertion.) A assigns its child to the new node and the new node assigns its parent to A. Then the new node assigns its child to B and B assigns its parent as the new node.

=== Deletion ===
Deletion is the process whereby a node is removed from the tree. Only certain nodes in a binary tree can be removed unambiguously.

==== Node with zero or one children ====

Suppose that the node to delete is node A. If A has no children, deletion is accomplished by setting the child of A&#x27;s parent to null. If A has one child, set the parent of A&#x27;s child to A&#x27;s parent and set the child of A&#x27;s parent to A&#x27;s child.

==== Node with two children ====
In a binary tree, a node with two children cannot be deleted unambiguously. However, in certain binary trees (including binary search trees) these nodes &quot;can&quot; be deleted, though with a rearrangement of the tree structure.

=== Traversal ===
Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal visit each node in a tree by recursively visiting each node in the left and right subtrees of the root. Below are the brief descriptions of above mentioned traversals.

==== Pre-order ====
In pre-order, we always visit the current node; next, we recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree, and then we recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree. The pre-order traversal is a topologically sorted one, because a parent node is processed before any of its child nodes is done.

==== In-order ====
In in-order, we always recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree; next, we visit the current node, and lastly, we recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree.

==== Post-order ====
In post-order, we always recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree; next, we recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree and then visit the current node. Post-order traversal can be useful to get postfix expression of a binary expression tree.

==== Depth-first order ====
In depth-first order, we always attempt to visit the node farthest from the root node that we can, but with the caveat that it must be a child of a node we have already visited. Unlike a depth-first search on graphs, there is no need to remember all the nodes we have visited, because a tree cannot contain cycles. Pre-order is a special case of this. See depth-first search for more information.

==== Breadth-first order ====
Contrasting with depth-first order is breadth-first order, which always attempts to visit the node closest to the root that it has not already visited. See breadth-first search for more information. Also called a &quot;level-order traversal&quot;.

In a complete binary tree, a node&#x27;s breadth-index (&quot;i&quot; − (2&quot;d&quot; − 1)) can be used as traversal instructions from the root. Reading bitwise from left to right, starting at bit &quot;d&quot; − 1, where &quot;d&quot; is the node&#x27;s distance from the root (&quot;d&quot; = ⌊log(&quot;i&quot;+1)⌋) and the node in question is not the root itself (&quot;d&quot; &gt; 0). When the breadth-index is masked at bit &quot;d&quot; − 1, the bit values and mean to step either left or right, respectively. The process continues by successively checking the next bit to the right until there are no more. The rightmost bit indicates the final traversal from the desired node&#x27;s parent to the node itself. There is a time-space trade-off between iterating a complete binary tree this way versus each node having pointer(s) to its sibling(s).

<doc id="4322" wikidata="Q892585" url="?curid=4322" title="Borel measure">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in measure theory, a Borel measure on a topological space is a measure that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all Borel sets). Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below.

==Formal definition==
Let formula_1 be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let formula_2 be the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open sets of formula_1; this is known as the σ-algebra of Borel sets. A Borel measure is any measure formula_4 defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets. A few authors require in addition that formula_4 is locally finite, meaning that every point has an open neighborhood with finite measure. For Hausdorff spaces, this implies that formula_6 for every compact set formula_7; and for locally compact Hausdorff spaces, the two conditions are equivalent. If a Borel measure formula_4 is both inner regular and outer regular, it is called a regular Borel measure. If formula_4 is both inner regular, outer regular, and locally finite, it is called a Radon measure. Alternatively, if a regular Borel measure formula_4 is tight, it is a Radon measure.

If formula_1 is a separable complete metric space, then every Borel measure formula_4 on formula_1 is a Radon measure.

==On the real line==
The real line formula_14 with its usual topology is a locally compact Hausdorff space; hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case, formula_15 is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of formula_14. While there are many Borel measures &quot;μ&quot;, the choice of Borel measure that assigns formula_17 for every half-open interval formula_18 is sometimes called &quot;the&quot; Borel measure on formula_14. This measure turns out to be the restriction to the Borel σ-algebra of the Lebesgue measure formula_20, which is a complete measure and is defined on the Lebesgue σ-algebra. The Lebesgue σ-algebra is actually the &quot;completion&quot; of the Borel σ-algebra, which means that it is the smallest σ-algebra that contains all the Borel sets and can be equipped with a complete measure. Also, the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., formula_21 for every Borel measurable set, where formula_4 is the Borel measure described above). This idea extends to finite-dimensional spaces formula_23 (the Cramér–Wold theorem, below) but does not hold, in general, for infinite-dimensional spaces. Infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measures do not exist.

==Product spaces==
If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are second-countable, Hausdorff topological spaces, then the set of Borel subsets formula_24 of their product coincides with the product of the sets formula_25 of Borel subsets of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. That is, the Borel functor 
: formula_26 
from the category of second-countable Hausdorff spaces to the category of measurable spaces preserves finite products.

==Applications==

===Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral===

The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is the ordinary Lebesgue integral with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of bounded variation on the real line. The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure, and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.

===Laplace transform===

One can define the Laplace transform of a finite Borel measure &quot;μ&quot; on the real line by the Lebesgue integral

: formula_27

An important special case is where &quot;μ&quot; is a probability measure or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function. In operational calculus, the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a distribution function &quot;f&quot;. In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes

: formula_28

where the lower limit of 0− is shorthand notation for

: formula_29

This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at 0 is entirely captured by the Laplace transform. Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the Laplace–Stieltjes transform.

===Moment problem===

One can define the moments of a finite Borel measure &quot;μ&quot; on the real line by the integral

: formula_30

For formula_31 these correspond to the Hamburger moment problem, the Stieltjes moment problem and the Hausdorff moment problem, respectively. The question or problem to be solved is, given a collection of such moments, is there a corresponding measure? For the Hausdorff moment problem, the corresponding measure is unique. For the other variants, in general, there are an infinite number of distinct measures that give the same moments.

===Hausdorff dimension and Frostman&#x27;s lemma===
Given a Borel measure &quot;μ&quot; on a metric space &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) &gt; 0 and &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;r&quot;)) ≤ &quot;rs&quot; holds for some constant &quot;s&quot; &gt; 0 and for every ball &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) in &quot;X&quot;, then the Hausdorff dimension dimHaus(&quot;X&quot;) ≥ &quot;s&quot;. A partial converse is provided by the Frostman lemma:

Lemma: Let &quot;A&quot; be a Borel subset of R&quot;n&quot;, and let &quot;s&quot; &gt; 0. Then the following are equivalent:
*&quot;H&quot;&quot;s&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) &gt; 0, where &quot;H&quot;&quot;s&quot; denotes the &quot;s&quot;-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
*There is an (unsigned) Borel measure &quot;μ&quot; satisfying &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) &gt; 0, and such that 
::formula_32 
:holds for all &quot;x&quot; ∈ R&quot;n&quot; and &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0.

===Cramér–Wold theorem===

The Cramér–Wold theorem in measure theory states that a Borel probability measure on formula_33 is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections. It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after Harald Cramér and Herman Ole Andreas Wold.

<doc id="4326" wikidata="Q49019" url="?curid=4326" title="Blackadder">
<text>Blackadder is a series of four period British sitcoms, plus several one-off instalments, which originally aired on BBC1 from 1983 to 1989. All television episodes starred Rowan Atkinson as the antihero Edmund Blackadder and Tony Robinson as Blackadder&#x27;s dogsbody, Baldrick. Each series was set in a different historical period, with the two protagonists accompanied by different characters, though several reappear in one series or another, e.g., Melchett (Stephen Fry), Lord Percy Percy / Captain Darling (Tim McInnerny) and George (Hugh Laurie).

The first series, &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, was written by Richard Curtis and Atkinson, while subsequent series were written by Curtis and Ben Elton. The shows were produced by John Lloyd. In 2000, the fourth series, &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;, ranked at 16 in the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, a list created by the British Film Institute. In a 2001 poll by Channel 4, Edmund Blackadder was ranked third on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In the 2004 TV poll to find Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom, &quot;Blackadder&quot; was voted the second-best British sitcom of all time, topped by &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. It was also ranked as the 9th-best TV show of all time by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine. Atkinson said Blackadder is &quot;the thing he found the least stressful&quot; to do.

==Premise==

Each series comprises six half-hour episodes and is set in a different period of British history. The first series, made in 1983, was titled &quot;The Black Adder&quot; and was set in the fictional reign of &quot;Richard IV&quot;. The second series, &quot;Blackadder II&quot; (1986), was set during the reign of Elizabeth I. &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; (1987) was set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries during the reign of George III. &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; (1989) was set in 1917 in the trenches of the Great War.

&quot;Blackadder&quot; follows the misfortunes of Edmund Blackadder (played by Atkinson). It is implied in each series that the Blackadder character is a descendant of the previous one. The end theme lyrics of the series 2 episode &quot;Head&quot; specify that he is the great-grandson of the previous incarnation, although it is never specified how or when any of the Blackadders (who are usually bachelors) manage to father children.

In series one, Edmund Blackadder is not particularly bright, and is much the intellectual inferior of his servant, Baldrick (played by Tony Robinson). However, in subsequent series, the positions are reversed: Blackadder is clever, shrewd, scheming and manipulative while Baldrick is extremely dim.

Each incarnation of Blackadder and Baldrick is also saddled with tolerating the presence of a dimwitted aristocrat. In the first two series, this is Lord Percy Percy, played by Tim McInnerny. Hugh Laurie plays the role in the third and fourth series, as Prince George, Prince Regent, and Lieutenant George, respectively. Stephen Fry&#x27;s Lord Melchett fills a similar role in the second and fourth series.

==Episodes==


===Series 1: &quot;The Black Adder&quot;===

&quot;The Black Adder&quot;, the first series of &quot;Blackadder&quot;, was written by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson and produced by John Lloyd. It originally aired on BBC1 from 15 June 1983 to 20 July 1983, and was a joint production with the Australian Seven Network.

Set in 1485 at the end of the British Middle Ages, the series is written as an alternative history in which Richard III won the Battle of Bosworth Field only to be mistaken for someone else and murdered, and is succeeded by Richard IV (Brian Blessed), one of the Princes in the Tower. The series follows the exploits of Richard IV&#x27;s unfavoured second son Edmund, the Duke of Edinburgh (who calls himself &quot;The Black Adder&quot;) in his various attempts to increase his standing with his father and his eventual quest to overthrow him. Guest appearances in this series include Peter Cook as King Richard III, Russell Enoch as the Duke of Winchester, Miriam Margolyes as the Infanta Maria Escalosa of Spain (with Jim Broadbent as her interpreter), Frank Finlay as the Witchsmeller Pursuivant, Valentine Dyall as Lord Angus, Stephen Frost and Mark Arden as guards, and Rik Mayall as Mad Gerald.

Conceived while Atkinson and Curtis were working on &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, the series dealt comically with a number of aspects of medieval life in Britain: witchcraft, royal succession, European relations, the Crusades, and the conflict between the Church and the Crown. Along with the secret history, many historical events portrayed in the series were anachronistic (for example, Constantinople had already fallen to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, predating the events in the episode by 32 years); this dramatic license would continue in the subsequent &quot;Blackadders&quot;. The filming of the series was highly ambitious, with a large cast and much location shooting. The series also featured Shakespearean dialogue, often adapted for comic effect; the end credits featured the words &quot;Additional Dialogue by William Shakespeare&quot;.

===Series 2: &quot;Blackadder II&quot;===

&quot;Blackadder II&quot; is set in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603), who is portrayed by Miranda Richardson. The principal character is Edmund, Lord Blackadder, the great-grandson of the original Black Adder. During the series, he regularly deals with the Queen, her obsequious Lord Chamberlain Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry; his rival for the Queen&#x27;s affections), his friend Lord Percy Percy (played by Tim McInnerny) and the Queen&#x27;s demented former nanny Nursie (Patsy Byrne). Guest appearances in the series include Tom Baker as Captain Redbeard Rum, Simon Jones as Sir Walter Raleigh, Ronald Lacey as the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and Miriam Margoyles as Blackadder&#x27;s aunt, Lady Whiteadder. The series also features two appearances by Hugh Laurie (as Simon Partridge, a friend of Blackadder&#x27;s, in the episode &quot;Beer&quot;; and as Prince Ludwig the Indestructible in the series&#x27; finale &quot;Chains&quot;), as well as the first appearance of Gabrielle Glaister as &quot;Bob&quot;, and of Rik Mayall as Lord Flashheart.

Following the BBC&#x27;s request for improvements (and a severe budget reduction), several changes were made. The second series was the first to establish the familiar Blackadder character: cunning, shrewd and witty, in sharp contrast to the first series&#x27; bumbling Prince Edmund. To reduce the cost of production, it was shot with virtually no outdoor scenes (the first series was shot largely on location) and several frequently used indoor sets, such as the Queen&#x27;s throne room and Blackadder&#x27;s front room.

A quote from this series ranked number three in a list of the top 25 television &quot;putdowns&quot; of the last 40 years by the &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine: &quot;The eyes are open, the mouth moves, but Mr. Brain has long since departed, hasn&#x27;t he, Percy?&quot;

===Series 3: &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;===
&quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; is set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a period known as the Regency. In the series, Edmund Blackadder Esquire is a butler to George IV, who is played as a buffoonish fop. Despite Edmund&#x27;s respected intelligence and abilities, he has no personal fortune to speak of, apart from his frequently fluctuating wage packet from the Prince (“If I’m running short of cash, all I have to do is go upstairs and ask Prince Fathead for a raise”), and from (it seems) stealing the Prince&#x27;s socks and selling them off. The episode titles were puns on Jane Austen’s novels &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

Along with Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson in their usual roles, this series starred Hugh Laurie as the Prince Regent and Helen Atkinson-Wood as Mrs. Miggins. The series features Dr. Samuel Johnson (Robbie Coltrane); William Pitt the Younger (Simon Osborne); the French Revolution (with Chris Barrie, Tim McInnerny as the Scarlet Pimpernel, and Nigel Planer); hammy theatrical actors (Kenneth Connor and Hugh Paddick); a squirrel-hating cross-dressing highwayman (Miranda Richardson); and a duel with the Duke of Wellington (Stephen Fry).

===Series 4: &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;===

This series is set in 1917, on the Western Front of the First World War. Another &quot;big push&quot; is planned, and Captain Blackadder&#x27;s one goal is to avoid being killed, but his schemes always land him back in the trenches. Blackadder is joined by his batman Private S. Baldrick (Tony Robinson) and idealistic Edwardian twit Lieutenant George (Hugh Laurie). General Melchett (Stephen Fry) rallies his troops from a French château from the front, where he is aided and abetted by his assistant, Captain Kevin Darling (Tim McInnerny), pencil-pusher supreme and Blackadder&#x27;s nemesis, whose name is played on for maximum comedic value. Guest appearances in this series include Stephen Frost as the leader of a firing squad detail, Miranda Richardson as Nurse Mary Fletcher-Brown, two further appearances of Gabrielle Glaister as &quot;Bob&quot; (in this series, a young woman who pretended to be a boy in order to join the army), Rik Mayall appearing as Royal Flying Corps Squadron Commander The Lord Flasheart, Adrian Edmondson as Baron Manfred von Richthofen (aka &quot;The Red Baron&quot;), and Geoffrey Palmer as Field Marshal Douglas Haig.

The series&#x27; tone is somewhat darker than the other &quot;Blackadder&quot;s; it details the privations of trench warfare as well as the incompetence and life-wasting strategies of the top brass. For example, Baldrick is reduced to cooking rats and making coffee from mud, while General Melchett hatches a plan for the troops to walk very slowly toward the German lines, because &quot;it&#x27;ll be the last thing Fritz will expect.&quot;

The final episode, &quot;Goodbyeee&quot;, is known for being extraordinarily poignant for a comedy – especially the final scene, which sees the main characters (Blackadder, Baldrick, George, and Darling) finally going &quot;over the top&quot; and charging off into the fog and smoke of no man&#x27;s land, presumably to die. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 and voted for by industry professionals, &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; was placed 16th.

===Specials===

====Pilot episode====

The &quot;Blackadder&quot; pilot was shot but never broadcast on TV in the UK (although some scenes were shown in the 25th anniversary special &quot;Blackadder Rides Again&quot;). One notable difference in the pilot, as in many pilots, is the casting. Baldrick is played not by Tony Robinson, but by Philip Fox. Another significant difference is that the character of Prince Edmund presented in the pilot is much closer to the intelligent, conniving Blackadder of the later series than the snivelling, weak buffoon of the original. Set in the year 1582, the script of the pilot is roughly the same as the episode &quot;Born to Be King&quot;, albeit with some different jokes, with some lines appearing in other episodes of the series.

UKTV Gold broadcast the pilot on 15 June 2023, as part of an 80-minute special hosted by Sir Tony Robinson and featuring interviews with Ben Elton and Richard Curtis.

====&quot;Blackadder: The Cavalier Years&quot;====

This special, set in the English Civil War, was shown as part of Comic Relief&#x27;s Red Nose Day on Friday 5 February 1988. The 15-minute episode is set in November 1648, during the last days of the Civil War. Sir Edmund Blackadder and his servant, Baldrick, are the last two men loyal to the defeated King Charles I of England (played by Stephen Fry), portrayed as a soft-spoken, ineffective, naive character, with the voice and mannerisms of Charles I&#x27;s namesake, the then Prince of Wales (now Charles III). However, owing to a misunderstanding between Oliver Cromwell (guest-star Warren Clarke) and Baldrick, the King is arrested and sent to the Tower of London. The rest of the episode revolves around Blackadder&#x27;s attempts to save the King as well as improve his own standing.

====&quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;====

The second special was broadcast on Friday 23 December 1988. In a twist on Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, Ebenezer Blackadder is the &quot;kindest and loveliest&quot; man in England. The Spirit of Christmas shows Blackadder the contrary antics of his ancestors and descendants, and reluctantly informs him that if he turns evil his descendants will enjoy power and fortune, while if he remains the same a future Blackadder will live shamefully subjugated to a future incompetent Baldrick. This remarkable encounter causes him to proclaim, &quot;Bad guys have all the fun&quot;, and adopt the personality with which viewers are more familiar.

====&quot;Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth&quot;====

&quot;Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth&quot; was originally shown in the Millennium Dome in 2000, followed by a screening on Sky One in the same year (and later on BBC1). It is set on the turn of the millennium, and features Lord Blackadder placing a bet with his friends – modern versions of Queenie (Miranda Richardson), Melchett (Stephen Fry), George (Hugh Laurie) and Darling (Tim McInnerny) – that he has built a working time machine. While this is intended as a clever con trick, the machine surprisingly works, sending Blackadder and Baldrick back to the Cretaceous period, where they manage to cause the extinction of the dinosaurs through the use of Baldrick&#x27;s best-worst-and-only pair of underpants as a weapon against a hungry T. Rex. Finding that Baldrick has forgotten to write dates on the machine&#x27;s dials, the rest of the film follows their attempts to find their way back to 1999, often creating huge historical anomalies in the process that must be corrected before the end. The film includes cameo appearances from Kate Moss and Colin Firth.

====&quot;The Big Night In&quot;====

Broadcast in 2020 as part of Children in Need and Comic Relief&#x27;s joint special &quot;The Big Night In&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fry resumed the role of Lord Melchett (an intellectually-brilliant version), Head of the Royal Household, under lockdown at Melchett Manor, to help Prince William deal with educating his children via Zoom and discussing &quot;Tiger King&quot;, before they both step outside to clap for the National Health Service. Melchett is said to be isolating with Lord Blackadder, both grandsons to their First World War counterparts.

===Live stage performances===

In 1998, as part of Prince Charles&#x27; 50th Birthday Gala televised on ITV, Atkinson appeared as a Restoration Blackadder reading aloud a letter to the Privy Council of King Charles II. He colourfully refuses their invitation to stage a royal gala, calling such occasions &quot;very, very, very dull&quot; and asserting that there was &quot;more musical talent on display when my servant Baldrick breaks wind.&quot;

In 2000, on the BBC&#x27;s annual Royal Variety Performance, Atkinson portrayed Blackadder as a present-day officer in &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Royal Regiment of Shirkers&quot; and delivered a monologue titled &quot;Blackadder: The Army Years&quot;, proposing that Britain regain her former greatness by invading (or at least buying) France.

In 2012, as part of the Prince&#x27;s Trust charity show &quot;We Are Most Amused&quot;, Atkinson and Robinson reprised their roles as Blackadder and Baldrick in a comedy sketch featuring Miranda Hart as leader of a government inquiry into the recent banking crisis. Blackadder, chief executive of a fictional British bank, appearing with Baldrick as his gardener, convinces the panel to publicly blame the entire crisis on Baldrick, to the latter&#x27;s consternation.

===Red Nose Day 2023===
Baldrick (Tony Robinson) returned in 2023 for a Red Nose Day sketch for the BBC. There was no involvement of Rowan Atkinson or a subsequent reboot, amid speculation.

===Chronological order===
==Production==

===Series development===
Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis developed the idea for the sitcom while working on &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. Eager to avoid comparisons to the critically acclaimed &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, they proposed the idea of a historical sitcom. A pilot episode was made in 1982, and a six-episode series was commissioned. The budget for the series was considerable, with much location shooting particularly at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland and the surrounding countryside in February 1983. The series also used large casts of extras, horses and expensive medieval-style costumes. Atkinson has said about the making of the first series:

The first series was odd, it was very extravagant. It cost a million pounds for the six programmes ... [which] was a lot of money to spend ... It looked great, but it wasn&#x27;t as consistently funny as we would have liked.

Owing to the high cost of the first series, the then-controller of programming of BBC1, Michael Grade, was reluctant to sign off a second series without major improvements to the show and drastic cost-cutting, leaving a gap of three years between the two series.

A chance meeting between Richard Curtis and comedian Ben Elton led to the decision to collaborate on a new series of Blackadder. Recognising the main faults of the first series, Curtis and Elton agreed that &quot;Blackadder II&quot; would be a studio-only production (along with the inclusion of a live audience during recording, instead of showing the episodes to an audience after taping). Besides adding a greater comedy focus, Elton suggested a major change in character emphasis: Baldrick would become the stupid sidekick, while Edmund Blackadder evolved into a cunning sycophant. This led to the familiar set-up that was maintained in the following series.

Only in the &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot; millennium special was the shooting once again on location, because this was a production with a budget estimated at £3 million, and was a joint venture between Tiger Aspect, Sky Television, the New Millennium Experience Company and the BBC, rather than the BBC alone.

===Casting===
Each series tended to feature the same set of regular actors in different period settings, although throughout the four series and specials, only Blackadder and Baldrick were constant characters. Several regular cast members recurred as characters with similar names, implying, like Blackadder, that they were descendants.

====Recurring cast====
Various actors have appeared in more than one of the Blackadder series and/or specials. These are:

====Main cast====
*Rowan Atkinson as Edmund Blackadder, the series&#x27; protagonist.
*Tony Robinson as S. Baldrick, his servant.
*Stephen Fry as Melchett in two series, first as Lord Melchett, the sycophantic adviser to Queen Elizabeth I in series two, and secondly as General Melchett, a blustering buffoon and presumed descendant in series four. Fry also appeared as Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, in series three and as various characters in &quot;Blackadder Back &amp; Forth&quot;.
*Tim McInnerny as Lord Percy Percy, Blackadder&#x27;s dimwitted sidekick in series one and two before a change of character to antagonistic rival Captain Kevin Darling in series four. He also appeared as The Scarlet Pimpernel (alias Lord Topper and Le Comte de Frou Frou) for one episode in the third series, and reprised his role as Darling in &quot;Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth&quot;.
*Hugh Laurie played George in series three and four, first as the Prince Regent, and later Lieutenant George in series four. Laurie also appeared twice in series two; first as Simon &quot;Farters Parters&quot; Partridge or &quot;Mr. Ostrich&quot; in the episode &quot;Beer&quot;, and then as Prince Ludwig the Indestructible in &quot;Chains&quot;, the final instalment episode of &quot;Blackadder II&quot;. He reprised his role as George in &quot;Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth&quot;.
*Miranda Richardson was only a regular cast member for series two, in which she played Queen Elizabeth I, reprising the role in &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot;. However, she also played significant one-off roles as Amy Hardwood (a.k.a. The Shadow) in &quot;Amy and Amiability&quot; in the third series, and Mary Fletcher-Brown, a dutiful nurse in &quot;General Hospital&quot; from the fourth. She reappeared as Queenie and additional characters in Christmas Carol and Back and Forth.

====Non-recurring cast====
*Brian Blessed, Elspet Gray and Robert East appeared in all six episodes of the first series as the Black Adder&#x27;s father, mother and brother, respectively. Gray had also appeared in the non-broadcast pilot.
*Patsy Byrne played Nursie in all six episodes of &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, but never featured in either of the subsequent series, either as a regular character or one-off. She briefly reprised the character in &quot;&quot; and &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;.
*Helen Atkinson-Wood played the role of Mrs. Miggins in all six episodes of &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;, but did not appear again in the series, although the character was mentioned several times in &quot;Blackadder II&quot; and in the final episode of &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;.

====Guest cast====
Ben Elton&#x27;s arrival after the first series heralded the more frequent recruitment of comic actors from the alternative comedy era for guest appearances, including Robbie Coltrane, Rik Mayall (who had appeared in the final episode of the first series as &quot;Mad Gerald&quot;), Adrian Edmondson, Nigel Planer, Mark Arden, Stephen Frost, Chris Barrie and Jeremy Hardy. Elton himself played an anarchist in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;.

Gabrielle Glaister played Bob, an attractive girl who poses as a man, in both series 2 and Driver Parkhurst in series 4. Rik Mayall plays Lord Flashheart, a vulgar friend in his first appearance and then a successful rival of Blackadder in later episodes of series 2 and 4. He also played a decidedly Flashheart-like Robin Hood in &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot;. Lee Cornes also appeared in an episode of all three Curtis-Elton series. He appeared as a guard in the episode &quot;Chains&quot; of &quot;Blackadder II&quot;; as the poet Shelley in the episode &quot;Ink and Incapability&#x27; of &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;; and as firing squad soldier Private Fraser in the episode &quot;Corporal Punishment&quot; of &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;.

More established actors, some at the veteran stage of their careers, were also recruited for roles. These included Peter Cook, John Grillo, Simon Jones, Tom Baker, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Paddick, Frank Finlay, Kenneth Connor, Bill Wallis, Ronald Lacey, Roger Blake, Denis Lill, Warren Clarke and Geoffrey Palmer, who played Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig in &quot;Goodbyeee&quot;, the final episode of &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;. Miriam Margolyes played three different guest roles: The Spanish Infanta in The Queen of Spain&#x27;s Beard, Lady Whiteadder in Beer, and Queen Victoria in Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol.

Unusually for a sitcom based loosely on factual events and in the historical past, a man was recruited for one episode essentially to play himself. Political commentator Vincent Hanna played a character billed as &quot;his own great-great-great grandfather&quot; in the episode &quot;Dish and Dishonesty&quot; of &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;. Hanna was asked to take part because the scene was of a by-election in which Baldrick was a candidate and, in the style of modern television, Hanna gave a long-running &quot;live&quot; commentary of events at the count (and interviewed candidates and election agents) to a crowd through the town hall window.

===Theme tune===
Howard Goodall&#x27;s theme tune has the same melody throughout all the series, but is played in roughly the style of the period in which it is set. It is performed mostly with trumpets and timpani in &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, the fanfares used suggesting typical medieval court fanfares; with a combination of recorder, string quartet and electric guitar in &quot;Blackadder II&quot; (the end theme, with different lyrics each time reflecting on the episode&#x27;s events, was sung by a countertenor); on oboe, cello and harpsichord (in the style of a minuet) for &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;; by The Band of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment in &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;; sung by carol singers in &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;; and by an orchestra in &quot;Blackadder: The Cavalier Years&quot; and &quot;Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth&quot;.

==Awards==
In 2000, the fourth series, &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;, ranked at 16 in the &quot;100 Greatest British Television Programmes&quot;, a list created by the British Film Institute. In 2004, a BBC TV poll for &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;, &quot;Blackadder&quot; was voted the second best British sitcom of all time, topped by &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. It was also ranked as the 20th Best TV Show of All Time by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine.

==Future==

Despite regular statements denying any plans for a fifth series, cast members are regularly asked about the possibility of a new series.

In January 2005, Tony Robinson told ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; that Rowan Atkinson was more keen than he has been in the past to do a fifth series, set in the 1960s (centred on a rock band called the &quot;Black Adder Five&quot;, with Baldrick – a.k.a. &#x27;Bald Rick&#x27; – as the drummer). In the documentary &quot;Blackadder Rides Again&quot;, Robinson stated that the series would present Blackadder as the bastard son of Queen Elizabeth II and running a Beatles-like rock band. Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Tim McInnerny and Miranda Richardson would have reprised their roles, and reportedly, Brian Blessed, Elspet Gray and Robert East would have returned from the first series to play Blackadder&#x27;s biological family. Robinson in a stage performance 1 June 2007, again mentioned this idea, but in the context of a movie.

One idea mentioned by Curtis was that it was Baldrick who had accidentally assassinated John F. Kennedy. However, aside from a brief mention in June 2005,
there have been no further announcements from the BBC that a new series is being planned. Furthermore, in November 2005, Rowan Atkinson told &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; that, although he would very much like to do a new series set in Colditz or another prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, something which both he and Stephen Fry reiterated at the end of &quot;Blackadder Rides Again&quot;, the chances of it happening are extremely slim.

There were a couple of ideas that had previously floated for the fifth series. &quot;Batadder&quot; was intended to be a parody of &quot;Batman&quot; with Baldrick as the counterpart of Robin (suggested by John Lloyd). This idea eventually came to surface as part of the &quot;Comic Relief&quot; sketch &quot;Spider-Plant Man&quot; in 2005, with Atkinson as the title hero, Robinson as Robin, Jim Broadbent as Batman and Rachel Stevens as Mary Jane. &quot;Star Adder&quot; was to be set in space in the future (suggested by Atkinson).

On 10 April 2007, &quot;Hello!&quot; reported that Atkinson was moving forward with his ideas for a fifth series. He said, &quot;I like the idea of him being a prisoner of war in Colditz. That would have the right level of authority and hierarchy which is apparent in all the Blackadders.&quot;

Stephen Fry has expressed the view that, since the series went out on such a good &quot;high&quot;, a film might not be a good idea.

During his June 2007 stage performance, chronicled on the Tony Robinson&#x27;s Cunning Night Out DVD, Robinson states that, after filming the &quot;Back &amp; Forth special&quot;, the general idea was to reunite for another special in 2010. Robinson jokingly remarked that Hugh Laurie&#x27;s success on &quot;House&quot; may make that difficult.

On 28 November 2012, Rowan Atkinson reprised the role at the &quot;We are most amused&quot; comedy gala for the Prince&#x27;s Trust at the Royal Albert Hall. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.

In August 2015, Tony Robinson said in an interview &quot;I do think a new series of Blackadder is on the cards. I have spoken to virtually all the cast about this now. The only problem is Hugh [Laurie]&#x27;s fee. He&#x27;s a huge star now.&quot; However, in October 2018, Richard Curtis &quot;dashed hopes&quot; that the show would return for a fifth series.

In April 2017 at the BFI &amp; Radio Times Television Festival, Atkinson stated &quot;There are no plans to do anything&quot; and revealed a potential Russian Revolution themed series that never materialised:

“There was a plan twenty years ago that got nowhere which was called &quot;Redadder&quot; which I quite liked. It was set in Russia in 1917 and &quot;Blackadder&quot; and Baldrick were working for the Tsar. They had blue stripes around their caps and then the Revolution happened and Rik Mayall unsurprisingly was playing Rasputin.

In December 2020, Rowan Atkinson told the &quot;Radio Times&quot;:

I don&#x27;t actually like the process of making anything – with the possible exception of &quot;Blackadder&quot;. Because the responsibility for making that series funny was on many shoulders, not just mine. &quot;Blackadder&quot; represented the creative energy we all had in the &#x27;80s. To try to replicate that 30 years on wouldn&#x27;t be easy.

Most recently, in December 2024, Ben Elton poured doubt on a fifth series of &quot;Blackadder&quot;: 

But there will not be a fifth series of &quot;Blackadder&quot;, I think that’s pretty much a certainty. I have no interest in doing it. I don’t think any of us do, with the possible exception of Tony [Robinson]. But if we did, the world would be our oyster. We could have fun with any period.

<text>The Boii (Latin plural, singular &quot;Boius&quot;; ) were a Celtic tribe of the later Iron Age, attested at various times in Cisalpine Gaul (present-day Northern Italy), Pannonia (present-day Austria and Hungary), present-day Bavaria, in and around present-day Bohemia (after whom the region is named in most languages; comprising the bulk of today&#x27;s Czech Republic), parts of present-day Slovakia and Poland, and Gallia Narbonensis (located in modern Languedoc and Provence).

In addition, the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 2nd century BC Celts expanded from Bohemia through the Kłodzko Valley into Silesia, now part of Poland and the Czech Republic.

They first appear in history in connection with the Gallic invasion of northern Italy, 390 BC, when they made the Etruscan city of Felsina their new capital, Bononia (Bologna).

After a series of wars, they were decisively beaten by the Romans in the Battle of Mutina (193 BC) and their territory became part of the Roman province of Cisalpine Gaul. According to Strabo, writing two centuries after the events, rather than being destroyed by the Romans like their Celtic neighbours,

Around 60 BC, a group of Boii joined the Helvetiis&#x27; ill-fated attempt to conquer land in western Gaul and were defeated by Julius Caesar, along with their allies, in the Battle of Bibracte.

Caesar settled the remnants of that group in Gorgobina, from where they sent 2,000 warriors to Vercingetorix&#x27;s aid at the Battle of Alesia six years later. The eastern Boii on the Danube were incorporated into the Roman Empire in 8 AD.

==Etymology and name==
From all the different names of the same Celtic people in literature and inscriptions, it is possible to abstract a Continental Celtic segment, .

There are two major derivations of this segment, both presupposing that it belongs to the family of Indo-European languages: from &#x27;cow&#x27; and from &#x27;warrior.&#x27; The Boii would thus be either &#x27;the herding people&#x27; or &#x27;the warrior people&#x27;.

The &#x27;cow&#x27; derivation depends most immediately on the Old Irish legal term for &#x27;outsider&#x27;: &quot;ambue&quot;, from Proto-Celtic (&lt;&quot;*an-bouios&quot;), &#x27;not a cattle owner&#x27;.

In a reference to the first known historical Boii, Polybius relates that their wealth consisted of cattle and gold, that they depended on agriculture and war, and that a man&#x27;s status depended on the number of associates and assistants he had. The latter were presumably the &#x27;, as opposed to the man of status, who was &#x27;, a cattle owner, and the &quot;&quot; were originally a class, &#x27;the cattle owners&#x27;.

The &#x27;warrior&#x27; derivation was adopted by the linguist Julius Pokorny, who presented it as being from Indo-European , , &#x27;hit&#x27;; however, not finding any Celtic names close to it (except for the Boii), he adduces examples somewhat more widely from originals further back in time: &quot;phohiio-s-&quot;, a Venetic personal name; &quot;Boioi&quot;, an Illyrian tribe; &quot;Boiōtoi&quot;, a Greek tribal name (the Boeotians); and a few others.

The same wider connections can be hypothesized for the &#x27;cow&#x27; derivation: the Boeotians have been known for well over a century as a people of kine, which might have been parallel to the meaning of Italy as &#x27;land of calves&#x27;. Indo-European reconstructions can be made using &#x27;cow&#x27; as a basis, such as ; the root may itself be an imitation of the sound a cow makes.

Contemporary derived words include &quot;Boiorix&quot; (&#x27;king of the Boii&#x27;, one of the chieftains of the Cimbri) and &quot;Boiodurum&quot; (&#x27;gate/fort of the Boii&#x27;, modern Passau) in Germany. Their memory also survives in the modern regional names of Bohemia (&quot;Boiohaemum&quot;), a mixed-language form from and Proto-Germanic , &#x27;home&#x27;: &#x27;home of the Boii&#x27;, and , Bavaria, which is derived from the Germanic &quot;Baiovarii&quot; tribe (Germanic &quot;*baja-warjaz&quot;: the first component is most plausibly explained as a Germanic version of &quot;Boii&quot;; the second part is a common formational morpheme of Germanic tribal names, meaning &#x27;dwellers&#x27;, as in Old English &quot;-ware&quot;); this combination &#x27;Boii-dwellers&#x27; may have meant &#x27;those who dwell where the Boii formerly dwelt&#x27;.

==History==
===Settlement in north Italy===
According to the ancient authors, the Boii arrived in northern Italy by crossing the Alps. While of the other tribes who had come to Italy along with the Boii, the Senones, Lingones and Cenomani are also attested in Gaul at the time of the Roman conquest. It remains therefore unclear where exactly the Central Europe origins of the Boii lay, if somewhere in Gaul, Southern Germany or in Bohemia.

Polybius relates that the Celts were close neighbors of the Etruscan civilization and &quot;cast covetous eyes on their beautiful country&quot;.

Invading the Po Valley with a large army, they drove out the Etruscans and resettled it, the Boii taking the right bank in the center of the valley. Strabo confirms that the Boii emigrated from their lands across the Alps and were one of the largest tribes of the Celts. The Boii occupied the old Etruscan settlement of Felsina, which they named &quot;Bononia&quot; (modern Bologna). Polybius describes the Celtic way of life in Cisalpine Gaul as follows:
The archaeological evidence from Bologna and its vicinity contradicts the testimony of Polybius and Livy on some points, who say the Boii expelled the Etruscans and perhaps some were forced to leave.

It indicates the Boii neither destroyed nor depopulated Felsinum, but simply moved in and became part of the population by intermarriage. 

The cemeteries of the period in Bologna contain La Tène weapons and other artifacts, as well as Etruscan items such as bronze mirrors. At Monte Bibele not far away one grave contained La Tène weapons and a pot with an Etruscan female name scratched on it.

===War against Rome===
In the second half of the 3rd century BC, the Boii allied with the other Cisalpine Gauls and the Etruscans against Rome. They also fought alongside Hannibal, killing the Roman general Lucius Postumius Albinus in 216 BC, whose skull was then turned into a sacrificial bowl.

A short time earlier, they had been defeated at the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC, and were again at Placentia in 194 BC (modern Piacenza) and Mutina in 193 BC (modern Modena). Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica completed the Roman conquest of the Boii in 191 BC, celebrating a triumph for it. After their losses, according to Strabo, a large portion of the Boii left Italy.

===Boii on the Danube===
Contrary to the interpretation of the classical writers, the Pannonian Boii attested in later sources are not simply the remnants of those who had fled from Italy, but rather another division of the tribe, which had settled there much earlier.

The burial rites of the Italian Boii show many similarities with contemporary Bohemia, such as inhumation, which was uncommon with the other Cisalpine Gauls, or the absence of the typically western Celtic torcs.

This makes it much more likely that the Cisalpine Boii had actually originated from Bohemia rather than the other way round.

Having migrated to Italy from north of the Alps, some of the defeated Celts simply moved back to their kinsfolk.

The Pannonian Boii are mentioned again in the late 2nd century BC when they repelled the Cimbri and Teutones (Strabo VII, 2, 2). Later on, they attacked the city of Noreia (in modern Austria) shortly before a group of Boii (32,000 according to Julius Caesar) joined the Helvetii in their attempt to settle in western Gaul.

After the Helvetian defeat at Bibracte, the influential Aedui tribe allowed the Boii survivors to settle on their territory, where they occupied the &quot;oppidum&quot; of Gorgobina. Although attacked by Vercingetorix during one phase of the war, they supported him with two thousand troops at the battle of Alesia (Caesar, &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, VII, 75).

Again, other parts of the Boii had remained closer to their traditional home, and settled in the Slovak and Hungarian lowlands by the Danube and the Mura, with a centre at Bratislava.

===Dacian Conquest===

Around 60 BC, they clashed with the rising power of the Dacians under their king Burebista and were defeated. The Dacians, under the leadership of Burebista, likely used a combination of military force and political strategies to conquer the Boii and compel some of them to migrate. Burebista&#x27;s aggressive expansionist policies may have included military campaigns aimed at weakening the Boii and forcing them to surrender or flee. Additionally, Burebista may have employed diplomatic tactics to sow discord among the Boii to further pressure them.

Once the Boii were defeated or weakened, the Dacians would have annexed their territory, incorporating it into their expanding kingdom. The migration of the Boii through Europe may have been a consequence of their defeat and the Dacian occupation of their lands, as they sought new territories and opportunities elsewhere. However, specific details of this conquest and migration are often scarce in historical records, leaving much open to interpretation.
When the Romans finally conquered Pannonia in 8 AD, the Boii seem not to have opposed them. Their former territory was now called &quot;deserta Boiorum&quot; (deserta meaning &#x27;empty or sparsely populated lands&#x27;).

However, the Boii had not been exterminated: There was a &quot;civitas Boiorum et Azaliorum&quot; (the Azalii being a neighbouring tribe) which was under the jurisdiction of a prefect of the Danube shore (&quot;praefectus ripae Danuvii&quot;). This , a common Roman administrative term designating both a city and the tribal district around it, was later adjoined to the city of Carnuntum.

==The Boii in ancient sources==

===Plautus===
Plautus refers to the Boii in &quot;Captivi&quot;:
There is a play on words: &quot;Boia&quot; means &#x27;woman of the Boii&#x27;, also &#x27;convicted criminal&#x27;s restraint collar&#x27;.

===Livy===
In volume 21 of his &quot;History of Rome&quot;, Livy (59 BC – 17 AD) claims that it was a Boio man that offered to show Hannibal the way across the Alps.
===Inscriptions===
In the first century BC, the Boii living in an oppidum of Bratislava minted Biatecs, high-quality coins with inscriptions (probably the names of kings) in Latin letters. At the oppidum of Manching there was a ceramic found bearing the labeling &quot;Boius&quot; or &quot;Baius&quot; which is being displayed at the local Celts and Romans museum.

<text>Backgammon is a two-player board game played with counters and dice on tables boards. It is the most widespread Western member of the large family of tables games, whose ancestors date back at least 1,600 years. The earliest record of backgammon itself dates to 17th-century England, being descended from the 16th-century game of Irish.

Backgammon is a two-player game of contrary movement in which each player has fifteen pieces known traditionally as men (short for &#x27;tablemen&#x27;), but increasingly known as &#x27;checkers&#x27; in the United States in recent decades, analogous to the other board game of checkers. The backgammon table pieces move along twenty-four &#x27;points&#x27; according to the roll of two dice. The objective of the game is to move the fifteen pieces around the board and be first to &quot;bear off&quot;, i.e., remove them from the board. The achievement of this while the opponent is still a long way behind results in a triple win known as a &quot;backgammon&quot;, hence the name of the game.

Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck from rolling dice. While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over a series of many games. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their pieces and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. The optional use of a doubling cube allows players to raise the stakes during the game.

== History ==
The earliest specific reference to backgammon was in a letter dated 1635, when it was emerging as a variant of the popular medieval Anglo-Scottish game of Irish; the latter was described as a better game. By the 19th century, however, backgammon had spread to Europe, where it rapidly superseded other tables games like Trictrac in popularity, and also to America, where the doubling cube was introduced. In other parts of the world, different tables games such as Nard or Nardy are better known.

=== Tables games ===

Backgammon is a recent member of the large family of tables games that date back to ancient times. Its equipment is similar or identical to earlier tables games that have been depicted for centuries in art, leading to the mistaken belief that backgammon itself is much older.

==== Ancient history ====
The history of board games can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archaeological discoveries of the Jiroft culture, located in present-day Iran, the world&#x27;s oldest game set having been discovered in the region with equipment comprising a dumbbell-shaped board, counters and dice. Although its precise rules are unknown, it has been termed the Game of 20 Squares and Irving Finkel has suggested a possible reconstruction. The Royal Game of Ur from 2600 BC may also be an ancestor or intermediate of modern-day table games like backgammon and is the oldest game for which rules have been handed down. It used tetrahedral dice. Various other board games spanning the 10th to 7th centuries BC have been found throughout modern day Iraq, Syria, Egypt and western Iran.

==== Sasanian Empire ====

The Persian tables game of nard or nardšir emerged somewhere between the 3rd and 6th century AD, one text (&quot;Kār-nāmag ī Ardaxšēr ī Pāpakān&quot;) linking it with Ardashir I (r. 224–41), founder of the Sasanian dynasty, whereas another (&quot;Wičārišn ī čatrang ud nihišn ī nēw-ardaxšēr&quot;) attributes it to Bozorgmehr Bokhtagan, the Vizier of Khosrow (r. 531–79), who is credited with the invention of the game.

==== Roman and Byzantine Empires ====

The earliest identifiable tables game, Tabula, meaning &#x27;table&#x27; or &#x27;board&#x27;, is described in an epigram of Byzantine Emperor Zeno (AD 476–491). The overall aim was to be first to bear one&#x27;s pieces off; the board had the typical tables layout, with 24 points, 12 on each side; and there were 15 counters per player. However, unlike modern Western backgammon, there were three cubical dice not two, no bar nor doubling die, and all counters started off the board. Modern backgammon follows the same rules as tabula for hitting a blot and for bearing off; and the rules for re-entering pieces in backgammon are the same as those for initially entering pieces in tabula. The name Tavli () is still used in Greece for various tables games, which are frequently played in town plateias and cafes.

The of Emperor Zeno&#x27;s time is believed to be a direct descendant of the earlier Roman &quot;ludus duodecim scriptorum&quot; (&#x27;Game of twelve lines&#x27;) with the board&#x27;s middle row of points removed, and only the two outer rows remaining. used a board with three rows of 12 points each, with the 15 pieces being moved in opposing directions by the two players across three rows according to the roll of the three cubical dice. Little specific text about the gameplay of has survived; it may have been related to the older Ancient Greek dice game &quot;Kubeia&quot;. The earliest known mention of the game is in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Ars Amatoria&quot; (&#x27;The Art of Love&#x27;), written between 1 BC and 8 AD. In Roman times, this game was also known as &quot;alea&quot;.

==== Western Europe ====

Tables games first appeared in France during the 11th century and became a favourite pastime of gamblers. In 1254, Louis IX issued a decree prohibiting his court officials and subjects from playing. They were played in Germany in the 12th century, and had reached Iceland by the 13th century. In Spain, the Alfonso X manuscript &quot;Libro de los Juegos&quot;, completed in 1283, describes rules for a number of dice and table games in addition to its discussion of chess. By the 17th century, games at tables had spread to Sweden. A wooden board and counters were recovered from the wreck of the &quot;Vasa&quot; among the belongings of the ship&#x27;s officers. Tables games appear widely in paintings of this period, mainly those of Dutch and German painters, such as van Ostade, Jan Steen, Hieronymus Bosch, and Bruegel. Among surviving artworks are &quot;Cardsharps&quot; by Caravaggio.

=== Backgammon ===

==== Early backgammon ====

Backgammon&#x27;s immediate predecessor was the 16th century tables game of Irish. Irish was the Anglo-Scottish equivalent of the French &quot;Toutes Tables&quot; and Spanish &quot;Todas Tablas&quot;, the latter name first being used in the 1283 &quot;El Libro de los Juegos&quot;, a translation of Arabic manuscripts by the Toledo School of Translators. Irish had been popular at the Scottish court of James IV and considered to be &quot;the more serious and solid game&quot; when the variant which became known as Backgammon began to emerge in the first half of the 17th century. In medieval Italy, Barail was played on a backgammon board, with the important difference that both players moved their pieces counter-clockwise and starting from the same side of the board. The game rules for Barail are recorded in a 13th-century manuscript held in the Italian National Library in Florence.

The earliest mention of backgammon, under the name &quot;Baggammon&quot;, was by James Howell in a letter dated 1635. In English, the word &quot;backgammon&quot; is most likely derived from &quot;back&quot; and , meaning &quot;game&quot; or &quot;play&quot;. Meanwhile, the first use documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1650. In 1666, it is reported that the &quot;old name for backgammon used by Shakespeare and others&quot; was Tables. However, it is clear from Willughby that &quot;tables&quot; was a generic name and that the phrase &quot;playing at tables&quot; was used in a similar way to &quot;playing at cards&quot;. The first known rules of &quot;Back Gammon&quot; were produced by Francis Willoughby around 1672; they were quickly followed by Charles Cotton in 1674.

In the 16th century, Elizabethan laws and church regulations had prohibited &quot;playing at tables&quot; in England, but by the 18th century, Backgammon had superseded Irish and become popular among the English clergy. Edmond Hoyle published &quot;A Short Treatise on the Game of Back-Gammon&quot; in 1753; this described rules and strategy for the game and was bound together with a similar text on whist.

The early form of backgammon was very similar to its predecessor, Irish. The aim, board, number of pieces or &quot;men&quot;, direction of play and starting layout were the same as in the modern game. However, there was no doubling die, there was no bar on the board or the bar was not used (men simply being moved off the table when hit) and the scoring was different. The game was won double if either the winning throw was a doublet or the opponent still had men outside the home board. It was won triple if a player bore all men off before any of the opponent&#x27;s men reached the home board; this was a &quot;back-gammon&quot;. Some terminology, such as &quot;point&quot;, &quot;hitting a blot&quot;, &quot;home&quot;, &quot;doublet&quot;, &quot;bear off&quot; and &quot;men&quot; are recognisably the same as in the modern game; others, such as &quot;binding a man&quot; (adding a second man to a point) &quot;binding up the tables&quot; (taking all one&#x27;s first 6 points), &quot;fore game&quot;, &quot;latter game&quot;, &quot;nipping a man&quot; (hitting a blot and playing it on forwards) &quot;playing at length&quot; (using both dice to move one man) are no longer in vogue.

==== Modern backgammon ====

By no later than 1850, the rules of play had changed to those used today. Tables boards were now made with a &#x27;bar&#x27; in the centre and men that were hit went onto the bar. Winning double or by &quot;two hits&quot; was achieved by bearing all one&#x27;s men off before the other has borne this was now called a &quot;gammon&quot;. If the winner bore off all men while the loser still had men in his adversary&#x27;s table, it was a &quot;back-gammon&quot; and worth &quot;three hits&quot;, i.e., triple.

The most recent major development in backgammon was the addition of the doubling cube. Doubles had originally been recorded by placing &quot;common parlour matches&quot; on the bar in the centre of the board. A doubling cube was first introduced in the 1920s in New York City among members of gaming clubs in the Lower East Side. The cube required players not only to select the best move in a given position, but also to estimate the probability of winning from that position, transforming backgammon into the expected value-driven game played in the 20th and 21st centuries.

The popularity of backgammon surged in the mid-1960s, in part due to the charisma of Prince Alexis Obolensky who became known as &quot;The Father of Modern Backgammon&quot;. &quot;Obe&quot;, as he was called by friends, co-founded the International Backgammon Association, which published a set of official rules. He also established the World Backgammon Club of Manhattan, devised a backgammon tournament system in 1963, then organized the first major international backgammon tournament in March 1964, which attracted royalty, celebrities and the press. The game became a huge fad and was played on college campuses, in discothèques and at country clubs; stockbrokers and bankers began playing at conservative men&#x27;s clubs. People young and old all across the country dusted off their boards and pieces. Cigarette, liquor and car companies began to sponsor tournaments, and Hugh Hefner held backgammon parties at the Playboy Mansion. Backgammon clubs were formed and tournaments were held, resulting in a World Championship promoted in Las Vegas in 1967.

In the second half of the 20th century, new terms were introduced in America, such as &#x27;beaver&#x27; and &#x27;checkers&#x27; for men (although American backgammon experts Jacoby and Crawford continued to use both the older terms as well as the new ones).

Most recently, the United States Backgammon Federation (USBGF) was organized in 2009 to repopularize the game in the United States. Board and committee members include many of the top players, tournament directors and writers in the worldwide backgammon community. The USBGF has recently created Standards of Ethical Practice to address issues on which tournament rules fail to touch.

In its country of origin, the UK Backgammon Federation is the national authority and runs a backgammon the Backgammon Galaxy UK Open as well as club championships, online leagues and knockout tournaments. Like the USBGF they are active members of the World Backgammon Federation (WBF) and their tournament rules have been adopted in their entirety by the WBF.

==== Software ====
Backgammon entered the computer era in the 1990s when software was developed to play and analyze games, and for people to play one another over the internet.

*&quot;Johnson&#x27;s Expert Backgammon&quot;, introduced in 1990, was the first commercially available software package to analyze positions and provide stats for wins, losses, gammons, and backgammons. It was based on conventional programming techniques and only achieved a level of play of weak intermediate.
*&quot;TD-Gammon&quot;, written by Gerry Tesauro at IBM, used neural net techniques that allowed it to &quot;learn&quot; based on experience. A full package with rollouts was never released to the public.
*&quot;JellyFish&quot;, written by Fredriik Dahl and released in 1994, was the first commercially available software based on neural networks, and like TD-Gammon its play approached or surpassed that of the best human players.
*&quot;Snowie&quot;, written by André Nicoulin and Olivier Egger and released in 1998, was a neural-net program that had similar playing strength to its neural net predecessors, but had a more advanced user interface; in particular it could analyze an entire match instead of just one move at a time.
*&quot;gnubg&quot;, written by many programmers as part of the gnu free software project, was released in 2001. It has a similar strength to JellyFish, but is free software. It is still supported and is available for Windows, MAC OS, and most varieties of Linux. Since it is open source, the source code is publicly available.
*&quot;eXtreme Gammon&quot;, written by Xavier Dufaure de Citres and released in 2009, is available for Windows and mobile platforms. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, the program is the best backgammon player in the world, and the near-exclusive study tool for all serious backgammon players.

Real-time online play began with the First Internet Backgammon Server in July 1992, but there are now a range of options.

== Rules ==

Since 2018, backgammon has been overseen internationally by the World Backgammon Federation who set the rules of play for international tournaments.

Backgammon playing pieces may be termed men, checkers, draughts, stones, counters, pawns, discs, pips, chips, or nips. Checkers is a relatively modern American English term derived from another board game, draughts, which in US English is called checkers.

The objective is for players to bear off all their disc pieces from the board before their opponent can do the same. As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches where victory is awarded to the first player to reach a certain number of points.

=== Board ===

The dimensions of a board when opened, for a tournament game, should be at a minimum of 44 cm by 55 cm to a maximum of 66 cm by 88 cm.

=== Setup ===

Each side of the board has a track of 12 long triangles, called points. The points form a continuous track in the shape of a horseshoe, and are numbered from 1 to 24. In the most commonly used setup, each player begins with fifteen pieces; two are placed on their 24-point, three on their 8-point, and five each on their 13-point and their 6-point. The two players move their pieces in opposing directions, from the 24-point towards the 1-point.

Points 1 through 6 are called the home board or inner board, and points 7 through 12 are called the outer board. The 7-point is referred to as the bar point, and the 13-point as the midpoint. The 5-point for each player is sometimes called the &quot;golden point&quot;.

=== Movement ===
To start the game, each player rolls one die, and the player with the higher number moves first using the numbers shown on both dice. If the players roll the same number, they must roll again until they roll different numbers. Both dice must land completely flat on the right-hand side of the gameboard. The players then take alternate turns, rolling two dice at the beginning of each turn.

After rolling the dice, players must, if possible, move their pieces according to the number shown on each die. For example, if the player rolls a 6 and a 3 (denoted as &quot;6-3&quot;), the player must move one checker six points forward, and another or the same checker three points forward. The same checker may be moved twice, as long as the two moves can be made separately and legally: six and then three, or three and then six. If a player rolls two of the same number, called doubles, that player must play each die twice. For example, a roll of 5-5 allows the player to make four moves of five spaces each. On any roll, a player must move according to the numbers on both dice if it is at all possible to do so. If one or both numbers do not allow a legal move, the player forfeits that portion of the roll and the turn ends. If moves can be made according to either one die or the other, but not both, the higher number must be used. If one die is unable to be moved, but such a move is made possible by the moving of the other die, that move is compulsory.

In the course of a move, a checker may land on any point that is unoccupied or is occupied by one or more of the player&#x27;s own checkers. It may also land on a point occupied by exactly one opposing checker, or &quot;blot&quot;. In this case, the blot has been &quot;hit&quot; and is placed in the middle of the board on the bar that divides the two sides of the playing surface. A checker may never land on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers; thus, no point is ever occupied by checkers from both players simultaneously. There is no limit to the number of checkers that can occupy a point or the bar at any given time.

Checkers placed on the bar must re-enter the game through the opponent&#x27;s home board before any other move can be made. A roll of 1 allows the checker to enter on the 24-point (opponent&#x27;s 1), a roll of 2 on the 23-point (opponent&#x27;s 2), and so forth, up to a roll of 6 allowing entry on the 19-point (opponent&#x27;s 6). Checkers may not enter on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers. Checkers can enter on unoccupied points, or on points occupied by a single opposing checker; in the latter case, the single checker is hit and placed on the bar. A player may not move any other checkers until all checkers belonging to that player on the bar have re-entered the board. If a player has checkers on the bar, but rolls a combination that does not allow any of those checkers to re-enter, the player does not move. If the opponent&#x27;s home board is completely &quot;closed&quot; (i.e. all six points are each occupied by two or more checkers), there is no roll that will allow a player to enter a checker from the bar, and that player stops rolling and playing until at least one point becomes open (occupied by one or zero checkers) due to the opponent&#x27;s moves.

A turn ends only when the player has removed his or her dice from the board. Prior to this moment, a move can be undone and replayed an unlimited number of times.

=== Bearing off ===

When all of a player&#x27;s checkers are in that player&#x27;s home board, that player may start removing them; this is called &quot;bearing off&quot;. A roll of 1 may be used to bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on. If all of a player&#x27;s checkers are on points lower than the number showing on a particular die, the player must use that die to bear off one checker from the highest occupied point. For example, if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point and two on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the two checkers from the 5-point. When bearing off, a player may also move a lower die roll before the higher even if that means the full value of the higher die is not fully utilized. For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the lower die roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically. As before, if there is a way to use all moves showing on the dice by moving checkers within the home board or by bearing them off, the player must do so. If a player&#x27;s checker is hit while in the process of bearing off, that player may not bear off any others until it has been re-entered into the game and moved into the player&#x27;s home board, according to the normal movement rules.

The first player to bear off all fifteen of their own checkers wins the game. When keeping score in backgammon, the points awarded depend on the scale of the victory. A player who bears off all fifteen pieces when the opponent has borne off at least one, wins a &quot;single game&quot; worth 1 point. If all fifteen have been borne off before the opponent gets at least one checker off, this is a &quot;gammon&quot; or &quot;double game&quot; worth 2 points. A &quot;backgammon&quot; or &quot;triple game&quot; is worth 3 points and occurs when the losing player has borne off no pieces and has one or more on the bar and/or in the winner&#x27;s home table (inner board).

=== Doubling cube ===
To speed up match play and to provide an added dimension for strategy, a doubling cube is usually used. The doubling cube is not a die to be rolled, but rather a marker, with the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 inscribed on its sides to denote the current stake. At the start of each game, the doubling cube is placed on the midpoint of the bar with the number 64 showing; the cube is then said to be &quot;centered, on 1&quot;. When the cube is still centered, either player may start their turn by proposing that the game be played for twice the current stakes. Their opponent must either accept (&quot;take&quot;) the doubled stakes or resign (&quot;drop&quot;) the game immediately.

Whenever a player accepts doubled stakes, the cube is placed on their side of the board with the corresponding power of two facing upward, to indicate that the right to redouble, which is to offer to continue doubling the stakes, belongs exclusively to that player. If the opponent drops the doubled stakes, they lose the game at the current value of the doubling cube. For instance, if the cube showed the number 2 and a player wanted to redouble the stakes to put it at 4, the opponent choosing to drop the redouble would lose two, or twice the original stake.

There is no limit on the number of redoubles. Although 64 is the highest number depicted on the doubling cube, the stakes may rise to 128, 256, and so on. In money games, a player is often permitted to &quot;beaver&quot; when offered the cube, doubling the value of the game again, while retaining possession of the cube.

A variant of the doubling cube &quot;beaver&quot; is the &quot;raccoon&quot;. Players who doubled their opponent, seeing the opponent beaver the cube, may in turn then double the stakes once again (&quot;raccoon&quot;) as part of that cube phase before any dice are rolled. The opponent retains the doubling cube. An example of a &quot;raccoon&quot; is the following: White doubles Black to 2 points, Black accepts then beavers the cube to 4 points; White, confident of a win, raccoons the cube to 8 points, while Black retains the cube. Such a move adds greatly to the risk of having to face the doubling cube coming back at 8 times its original value when first doubling the opponent (offered at 2 points, counter offered at 16 points) should the luck of the dice change.

Some players may opt to invoke the &quot;Murphy rule&quot; or the &quot;automatic double rule&quot;. If both opponents roll the same opening number, the doubling cube is incremented on each occasion yet remains in the middle of the board, available to either player. The Murphy rule may be invoked with a maximum number of automatic doubles allowed and that limit is agreed to prior to a game or match commencing. When a player decides to double the opponent, the value is then a double of whatever face value is shown (e.g. if two automatic doubles have occurred putting the cube up to 4, the first in-game double will be for 8 points). The Murphy rule is not an official rule in backgammon and is rarely, if ever, seen in use at officially sanctioned tournaments.

The &quot;Jacoby rule&quot;, named after Oswald Jacoby, allows gammons and backgammons to count for their respective double and triple values only if the cube has already been offered and accepted. This encourages a player with a large lead to double, possibly ending the game, rather than to play it to conclusion hoping for a gammon or backgammon. The Jacoby rule is widely used in money play but is not used in match play.

The &quot;Crawford rule&quot;, named after John R. Crawford, is designed to make match play more equitable for the player in the lead. If a player is one point away from winning a match, that player&#x27;s opponent will always want to double as early as possible in order to catch up. Whether the game is worth one point or two, the trailing player must win to continue the match. To balance the situation, the Crawford rule requires that when a player first reaches a score one point short of winning, neither player may use the doubling cube for the following game, called the &quot;Crawford game&quot;. After the Crawford game, normal use of the doubling cube resumes. The Crawford rule is routinely used in tournament match play. It is possible for a Crawford game to never occur in a match.

If the Crawford rule is in effect, then another option is the &quot;Holland rule&quot;, named after Tim Holland, which stipulates that after the Crawford game, a player cannot double until after at least two rolls have been played by each side. It was common in tournament play in the 1980s, but is now rarely used.

== Related games ==
Minor variations to the standard game are common among casual players in certain regions. For instance, only allowing a maximum of five men on any point (Britain) or disallowing &quot;hit-and-run&quot; in the home board (Middle East).

There are also many relatives of backgammon within the tables family with different aims, modes of play and strategies. Some are played primarily throughout one geographic region, and others add new tactical elements to the game. These other tables games commonly have a different starting position, restrict certain moves, or assign special value to certain dice rolls, but in some geographic games even the rules and direction of movement of the counters change, rendering them fundamentally different.

&quot;Acey-deucey&quot; is a relative of backgammon in which players start with no counters on the board, and must enter them onto the board at the beginning of the game. The roll of 1-2 is given special consideration, allowing the player, after moving the 1 and the 2, to select any desired doubles move. A player also receives an extra turn after a roll of 1-2 or of doubles.

&quot;Hypergammon&quot; is a game in which players have only three counters on the board, starting with one each on the 24, 23 and 22 points. With the aid of a computer this game was solved by Hugh Sconyers around 1994, meaning that exact equities for all cube positions are available for all 32 million possible positions.

&quot;Nard&quot; is a traditional tables game from Persia which may be an ancestor of backgammon. It has a different opening layout in which all 15 pieces start on the 24th point. During play pieces may not be hit and there are no gammons or backgammons.

&quot;Ban-sugoroku&quot; is a Japanese game that is a close relative of backgammon. It utilizes the same starting position but has slightly different rules.

&quot;Russian backgammon&quot; is a variant described in 1895 as: &quot;...much in vogue in Russia, Germany, and other parts of the Continent...&quot;. Players start with no counters on the board, and both players move in the same direction to bear off in a common home board. In this variant, doubles are powerful: four moves are played as in backgammon, followed by four moves according to the difference of the dice value from 7, and then the player has another turn (with the caveat that the turn ends if any portion of it cannot be completed).

&quot;Gul bara&quot; and &quot;Tapa&quot; are tables games popular in south-eastern Europe and Turkey. The play will iterate among Backgammon, Gul Bara, and Tapa until one of the players reaches a score of 7 or 5. 

&quot;Coan ki&quot; is an ancient Chinese tables game.

&quot;Plakoto&quot;, &quot;Fevga&quot; and &quot;Portes&quot; are three varieties of tables games played in Greece. Together, the three are referred to as &quot;Tavli&quot; and are usually played one after the other; game being three, five, or seven points.

&quot;Misere (backgammon to lose)&quot; is a variant of backgammon in which the objective is to lose the game.

&quot;Tavla&quot; is a Turkish variation.

== Strategy and tactics ==
Backgammon is played in two principal variations, &quot;money&quot; and &quot;match&quot; play:

* Money play means that every point counts evenly and every game stands alone, whether money is actually being wagered or not; sometimes it is called &quot;unlimited&quot; play.
* Match play means that the players play until one side scores (or exceeds) a certain number of points. 
The format has a significant effect on strategy. In a match, the objective is not to win the maximum possible number of points, but rather to simply reach the score needed to win the match, so optimal play may depend on the match score. In money play, the theoretically correct checker play and cube action would never vary based on the score.

Backgammon has an established opening theory, although it is less detailed than that of chess. The tree of positions expands rapidly because of the number of possible dice rolls and the moves available on each turn. Recent computer analysis has offered more insight on opening plays, but the midgame is reached quickly. After the opening, backgammon players frequently rely on some established general strategies, combining and switching among them to adapt to the changing conditions of a game.
There are several strategies or &quot;game plans&quot; to achieve a win:

* The &quot;running game&quot; is a strategy minimizing or breaking contact while ahead in the race. 
* The &quot;holding game&quot; is holding a point on the opponent&#x27;s side of the board, called an anchor. As the game progresses, the player may gain an advantage by hitting an opponent&#x27;s blot from the anchor or by rolling large doubles that allow the checkers to escape into a running game.
* The &quot;priming game&quot; involves building a wall of checkers, called a prime, covering a number of consecutive points. This obstructs opposing checkers that are behind the prime. A checker trapped behind a six-point prime cannot escape until the prime is broken. 
* The &quot;attacking game&quot;, sometimes called a &quot;blitz&quot;, is a strategy of covering the home board as quickly as possible while hitting one&#x27;s opponent and keeping them on the bar. Because the opponent has difficulty re-entering from the bar or escaping, a player can quickly gain a race advantage and win the game, often with a gammon.

A &quot;backgame&quot; is a strategy that involves holding two or more anchors in an opponent&#x27;s home board while being substantially behind in the race. The anchors obstruct the opponent&#x27;s checkers and create opportunities to hit them as they move home. The backgame is generally used only to salvage a game wherein a player is already significantly behind. Using a backgame as an initial strategy is usually unsuccessful.

&quot;Duplication&quot; refers to the placement of checkers such that one&#x27;s opponent needs the same dice rolls to achieve different goals. For example, players may position all of their blots in such a way that the opponent must roll a 2 in order to hit any of them, reducing the probability of being hit more than once.

&quot;Diversification&quot; refers to a complementary tactic of placing one&#x27;s own checkers in such a way that more numbers are useful.

The &quot;pipcount&quot; is number of pips needed to move a player&#x27;s checkers around and off the board. Many positions require a measurement of a player&#x27;s standing in the race, for example, in making a doubling cube decision, or in determining whether to run home and begin bearing off. The difference between the two players&#x27; pip counts is a measure of the leader&#x27;s racing advantage. For cube decisions, a number of formulas have been developed over the years, including the Thorpe count, the Ward count, the Keith count, and iSight. These calculations enable a player to determine whether to offer or take a double based on the pipcount in non-contact positions.

===Cube handling===

Two theoretical models provide a basis for cube handling, i.e. when to offer a double and when to accept an offered double. Both ignore the effects of gammons and backgammons.

* The &quot;dead cube model&quot; ignores the advantage the taker gets from having sole access to the cube. It estimates that the &quot;takepoint&quot; (i.e. the minimum game winning chances to accept a cube) is 25% and the doubling window opens at 50%.
* The &quot;live cube model&quot; assumes a maximum value for sole cube access (i.e. that the taker may use the cube most efficiently by either raising the stakes or doubling out the opponent). It estimates that the takepoint is 20% and the doubling window opens at 80%.

In practice, the takepoints and doubling points are somewhere in between, since while cube ownership cannot be ignored, assuming maximal efficiency for a re-cube is also not a valid assumption. Ignoring gammons and backgammons, the takepoint in money play is about 22%. All of the above ignores gammons and backgammons for either side, so in practice the calculation of takepoints is more complicated.

==Equity==
A player&#x27;s equity in a money or unlimited game is the average expected value that will be won or lost as a result of that game. For instance, if a player is certain to win but has no chance of a gammon or backgammon their equity is 1 and their opponent&#x27;s equity is −1. If it is certain that the player will win a backgammon, their equity is 3 and their opponent&#x27;s equity is −3. In Example 1 below, the player&#x27;s winning chances are 75%, which corresponds to an equity of +0.5.
:&quot;Example 1&quot;

:Suppose there are only two checkers left on the board and the player on-roll has a checker on their six point and the opponent has a checker on their one point. The player on-roll will bear off with 27/36 rolls or 75% of the time. If the game was played from that position 100 times the on-roll player would win ~75 games and their opponent would win ~25 for a net win of ~50 points per 100 games. The on-roll player&#x27;s equity would be .5 and their opponent&#x27;s would be −.5.
:If the doubling cube was accessible they could offer the cube and increase their equity to 1: either their opponent passes the cube and the game is over, or their opponent takes the cube and loses 100 points per 100 games (instead of the 50 with the cube centered). This illustrates that the raw takepoint for money play is 25%.

:&quot;Example 2&quot;

:Now, suppose the on-roll player has two checkers, one on the five point and one on the one point while their opponent still has one on the one point. 23 rolls bear off both checkers so the winning percentage is 64% instead of 75% and the equities are about +0.28 ((64−36)/100) and −0.28. If the on-roll player offers the cube, their equity doubles to 0.56 and their opponent should take the cube because −0.56 is better than −1.

:&quot;Example 3&quot;

:This example is more complicated, since there are gammons and backgammons to be had by both players and it is not the last chance to offer the cube. Computer analysis estimates the player with the black pieces wins 72.1% of games, plus 2.0% gammons, and 0.1% backgammons. Their opponent wins 27.9% of games, 2.0% gammons, and no backgammons. This adds up to the following equities:

::No double 0.667

::Double, take 0.684

::Double, pass 1.000
:The on-roll player should offer a double since their equity increases, and their opponent should take since they retain more equity by taking than passing.

== Cheating ==

To reduce the possibility of cheating, most good-quality backgammon sets use precision dice and a dice cup. This reduces the likelihood of loaded dice being used, which is the main way of cheating in face-to-face play. A common method of cheating online is the use of a computer program to find the optimal move on each turn; to combat this, many online sites use move-comparison software that identifies when a player&#x27;s moves resemble those of a backgammon program. Online cheating has therefore become extremely difficult.

== Social and competitive play ==

=== Legality ===

In &quot;State of Oregon v. Barr&quot;, a 1982 court case pivotal to the continued widespread organised playing of backgammon in the US, the State argued that backgammon is a game of chance and that it was therefore subject to Oregon&#x27;s stringent gambling laws. Paul Magriel was a key witness for the defence, contradicting Roger Nelson, the expert prosecution witness, by saying, &quot;Game theory, however, really applies to games with imperfect knowledge, where something is concealed, such as poker. Backgammon is not such a game. Everything is in front of you. The person who uses that information in the most effective manner will win.&quot; After the closing arguments, Judge Stephen S. Walker concluded that backgammon is a game of skill, not a game of chance, and found the defendant, backgammon tournament director Ted Barr, not guilty of promoting gambling.

=== Club and tournament play ===

Played &quot;ad hoc&quot; in cafés and bars, clubs throughout Europe also host backgammon with informal gatherings to play throughout the day or in the evening as well as by way of social interaction. A few clubs offer specialized backgammon services, maintaining their own facilities or offering computer analysis of troublesome plays. Around 2003, some club leaders noticed a growth of interest in backgammon, and attributed it to the game&#x27;s popularity on the internet.

A backgammon chouette permits three or more players to participate in a single game, often for money. One player competes against a team of all the other participants, and positions rotate after each game. Chouette play often permits the use of multiple doubling cubes.

Backgammon clubs may also organize tournaments. Large club tournaments sometimes draw competitors from other regions, with final matches viewed by hundreds of spectators. The top players at regional tournaments often compete in major national and international championships. Winners at major tournaments may receive prizes of tens of thousands of dollars.

A successful triangular backgammon tournament, devised by UKBGF, was hosted in 2025 by the Walbrook Club versus the Haberdashers&#x27; &amp; Salters&#x27; Companies.

=== International competition ===

The first world championship competition in backgammon was held in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1967. Tim Holland was declared the winner that year and at the tournament the following year. For unknown reasons, there was no championship in 1970, but in 1971, Tim Holland again won the title. The competition remained in Las Vegas until 1975, when it moved to Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The years 1976, 1977 and 1978 saw &quot;dual&quot; World Championships, one in the Bahamas attended by the Americans, and the &quot;European Open Championships&quot; in Monte Carlo with mostly European players. In 1979, Lewis Deyong, who had promoted the Bahamas World Championship for the prior three years, suggested that the two events be combined. Monte Carlo was universally acknowledged as the site of the World Backgammon Championship and has remained as such for thirty years. The Monte Carlo tournament draws hundreds of players and spectators, and is played over the course of a week.

By the 21st century, the largest international tournaments had established the basis of a tour for top professional players. Major tournaments are held yearly worldwide. PartyGaming sponsored the first World Series of Backgammon in 2006 from Cannes and later the &quot;Backgammon Million&quot; tournament held in the Bahamas in January 2007 with a prize pool of one million dollars, the largest for any tournament to date. In 2008, the World Series of Backgammon ran the world&#x27;s largest international events in London, the UK Masters, the biggest tournament ever held in the UK with 128 international class players; the Nordic Open, which instantly became the largest in the world with around 500 players in all flights and 153 in the championship, and Cannes, which hosted the Riviera Cup, the traditional follow-up tournament to the World Championships. Cannes also hosted the WSOB championship, the WSOB finale, which saw 16 players play three-point shootout matches for €160,000. The event was recorded for television in Europe and aired on Eurosport.

The World Backgammon Association (WBA) has been holding the biggest backgammon tour on the circuit since 2007, the &quot;European Backgammon Tour&quot; (EBGT). In 2011, the WBA collaborated with the online backgammon provider Play65 for the 2011 season of the European Backgammon Tour and with &quot;Betfair&quot; in 2012. The 2013 season of the European Backgammon Tour featured 11 stops and 19 qualified players competing for €19,000 in a grand finale in Lefkosa, Northern Cyprus.

=== Gambling ===

When backgammon is played for money, the most common arrangement is to assign a monetary value to each point, and to play to a certain score, or until either player chooses to stop. The stakes are raised by gammons, backgammons, and use of the doubling cube. Backgammon is sometimes available in casinos. Before the commercialization of artificial neural network programs, proposition bets on specific positions were very common among backgammon players and gamblers. As with most gambling games, successful play requires a combination of luck and skill, as a single dice roll can sometimes significantly change the outcome of the game.

== Mediterranean and West Asian cultural significance ==
Backgammon is considered the national game in many countries of the Eastern Mediterranean: Egypt, Turkey, Cyprus, Syria, Israel, and Palestine, Lebanon and Greece.

The popularity of the game across the region is primarily an oral tradition, and appears to have been strengthened during the era of the Ottoman Empire, which controlled the whole Eastern Mediterranean in the early modern period. Afif Bahnassi, Syria&#x27;s director of antiquities, stated in 1988: &quot;For some reason, backgammon became the rage of the Ottoman Empire. It really spread across the Arab world with the Turks, and it stayed behind when they left.&quot; The game is a common feature of coffeehouses throughout the region. Since at least the early 19th century, Damascus became well known as the preeminent location for Damascene-style wooden marquetry backgammon sets that have become famous throughout the region.
A unique feature of backgammon throughout the region is players&#x27; use of mixed Persian and Turkish numbers to announce dice rolls, rather than Arabic or other local languages. Related to this phenomenon, the game is frequently referred to as &quot;Shesh Besh&quot;, which is a rhyming combination &quot;shesh&quot;, meaning six in Persian (as well as many historical and current Iranian languages), and &quot;besh&quot;, meaning five in Turkish. &quot;Shesh besh&quot; is commonly used to refer to when a player scores a 5 and 6 at the same time on dice. This language contains six types of irregular inflections:

* 1) doubles in pure Persian, (6–6 and 3–3);
* 2a) unequal throws in pure Persian, higher followed by lower
* 2b) unequal throws in pure Persian, with a connecting vowel in between
* 3) Mixed Turkish-Persian numeral (6–5, 5–5, 4–4)
* 4) alternatives for 2a and 2b in pure Turkish (6–4, 5–4, 5–1, 2–1)
* 5) special cases (3–2, 2–2, 1–1); where 3–2 is a version of 2a with a &quot;ba&quot; added for phonetic reasons, 2–2 is for &quot;twice&quot; or two-times-two, and 1–1 is a hybrid Turkish-Persian where &quot;hep&quot; is Turkish for &quot;altogether&quot;.

In the early 20th century, as use of Classical Arabic was being promoted with the rise of Arab nationalism, efforts were made to replace the Persian-Turkish numbers used in backgammon play.

== Studies and analysis ==

Backgammon has been studied considerably by computer scientists. Neural networks and other approaches have offered significant advances to software for gameplay and analysis. With 15 white and 15 black counters and 24 possible positions, backgammon has 18 quintillion possible legal positions.

The first strong computer opponent was BKG 9.8. It was written by Hans Berliner in the late 1970s on a DEC PDP-10 as an experiment in evaluating board game positions. Early versions of BKG played badly even against poor players, but Berliner noticed that its critical mistakes were always at transitional phases in the game. He applied principles of fuzzy logic to improve its play between phases, and by July 1979, BKG 9.8 was strong enough to play against the reigning world champion Luigi Villa. It won the match 7–1, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in any board game. Berliner stated that the victory was largely a matter of luck, as the computer received more favorable dice rolls.

In the late 1980s, backgammon programmers found more success with an approach based on artificial neural networks. TD-Gammon, developed by Gerald Tesauro of IBM, was the first of these programs to play near the expert level. Its neural network was trained using temporal difference learning applied to data generated from self-play. According to assessments by Bill Robertie and Kit Woolsey, TD-Gammon&#x27;s play was at or above the level of the top human players in the world. Woolsey said of the program that &quot;There is no question in my mind that its positional judgment is far better than mine.&quot;

Tesauro proposed using rollout analysis to compare the performance of computer algorithms against human players. In this method, a Monte-Carlo evaluation of positions is conducted (typically thousands of trials) where different random dice sequences are simulated. The rollout score of the human (or the computer) is the difference of the average game results by following the selected move versus following the best move, then averaged for the entire set of taken moves.

Neural network research has resulted in three modern proprietary programs, JellyFish, Snowie and eXtreme Gammon, as well as the shareware BGBlitz and the free software GNU Backgammon. These programs not only play the game, but offer tools for analyzing games and detailed comparisons of individual moves. The strength of these programs lies in their neural networks&#x27; weights tables, which are the result of months of training. Without them, these programs play no better than a human novice. For the bearoff phase, backgammon software usually relies on a database containing precomputed equities for all possible bearoff positions. There are 54,263 bearoff positions for each side. This means there are 542632 total bearoff positions (~3 billion positions). In 1981 Hugh Sconyers wrote a computer program that solved all positions with nine checkers or fewer for both sides. In the early 1990s Hugh extended his results to all bearoff positions. For each position there are four results: no cube, roller&#x27;s cube, center cube and opponent&#x27;s cube. So, Hugh&#x27;s bearoff database contains the exact answers to ~12 billion bearoff situations.

Another neural network software developed by Nikolaos Papachristou is Palamedes that was developed in the early 2000s and it can also play variations like Hypergammon, Portes, Plakoto, Fevga, Narde and has multiple engines for each one.

Computer-versus-computer competitions are also held at Computer Olympiad events.

<doc id="4331" wikidata="Q47680" url="?curid=4331" title="Book of Joshua">
<text>The Book of Joshua ( &quot;&quot;, Tiberian: &quot;Sēp̄er Yŏhōšūaʿ&quot;; ; ) is the sixth book in the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament, and is the first book of the Deuteronomistic history, the story of Israel from the conquest of Canaan to the Babylonian exile. It tells of the campaigns of the Israelites in central, southern and northern Canaan, the destruction of their enemies, and the division of the land among the Twelve Tribes, framed by two set-piece speeches, the first by God commanding the conquest of the land, and, at the end, the second by Joshua warning of the need for faithful observance of the Law (&quot;torah&quot;) revealed to Moses.

The strong consensus among scholars is that the Book of Joshua holds little historical value for early Israel and most likely reflects a much later period. The earliest parts of the book are possibly chapters 2–11, the story of the conquest; these chapters were later incorporated into an early form of Joshua likely written late in the reign of king Josiah (reigned 640–609 BCE), but the book was not completed until after the fall of Jerusalem to the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, and possibly not until after the return from the Babylonian exile in 539 BCE.

Many scholars interpret the book of Joshua as describing what would now be considered genocide. Other scholars counter that calling what the book of Joshua relates a &quot;genocide&quot; is anachronistic.

=== Narrative ===

==== God&#x27;s commission to Joshua (chapter 1) ====
Chapter 1 commences &quot;after the death of Moses&quot; and presents the first of three important moments in Joshua marked with major speeches and reflections by the main characters; here first God, and then Joshua, make speeches about the goal of conquest of the Promised Land; in chapter 12, the narrator looks back on the conquest; and in chapter 23 Joshua gives a speech about what must be done if Israel is to live in peace in the land.

God commissions Joshua to take possession of the land and warns him to keep faith with the Mosaic covenant. God&#x27;s speech foreshadows the major themes of the book: the crossing of the Jordan River and conquest of the land, its distribution, and the imperative need for obedience to the Law. Joshua&#x27;s own immediate obedience is seen in his speeches to the Israelite commanders and to the Transjordanian tribes, and the Transjordanians&#x27; affirmation of Joshua&#x27;s leadership echoes Yahweh&#x27;s assurances of victory.

==== Entry into the land and conquest (chapters 2–12) ====

Rahab, a Canaanite woman of the Bible, sets in motion the entrance into Canaan by the Israelites. To avoid repeating failed attempts by Moses to have notable men of Israel predict the success rate of entry into Canaan mentioned in the book of Numbers, Joshua tasks two regular men with entering Jericho as spies. They arrive at Rahab&#x27;s house and spend the night. The king of Jericho, having heard of possible Israelite spies, demands that Rahab reveal the men. She tells him that she is unaware of their whereabouts, when in reality, she hid them on her roof under flax. The next morning, Rahab professes her faith in God to the men and acknowledges her belief that Canaan was divinely reserved for the Israelites from the beginning. Because of Rahab&#x27;s actions, the Israelites are able to enter Canaan.

The Israelites cross the Jordan River through a miraculous intervention of God with the Ark of the Covenant and are circumcised at Gibeath-Haaraloth (translated as &quot;hill of foreskins&quot;), renamed Gilgal in memory. &quot;Gilgal&quot; sounds like &quot;Gallothi&quot;, &quot;I have removed&quot;, but is more likely to translate as &quot;circle of standing stones&quot;. The conquest begins with the battle of Jericho, followed by Ai (central Canaan), after which Joshua builds an altar to Yahweh at Mount Ebal in northern Canaan and renews the Covenant in a ceremony with elements of a divine land-grant ceremony, similar to ceremonies known from Mesopotamia.

The narrative then switches to the south. The Gibeonites trick the Israelites into entering an alliance with them by saying that they are not Canaanites. Despite this, the Israelites decide to keep the alliance by enslaving them instead. An alliance of Amorite kingdoms headed by the Canaanite king of Jerusalem attacks the Gibeonites but they are defeated with Yahweh&#x27;s miraculous help of stopping the Sun and the Moon, and hurling down large hailstones (Joshua 10:10–14). The enemy kings were eventually hanged on trees. The Deuteronomist author may have used the then-recent 701 BCE campaign of the Assyrian king Sennacherib in the Kingdom of Judah as his model; the hanging of the captured kings is in accordance with Assyrian practice of the 8th century BCE.

With the south conquered the narrative moves to the northern campaign. A powerful multi-national (or more accurately, multi-ethnic) coalition headed by the king of Hazor, the most important northern city, is defeated at the Battle of the Waters of Merom with Yahweh&#x27;s help. Hazor itself is then captured and destroyed. Chapter 11:16–23 summarises the extent of the conquest: Joshua has taken the entire land, almost entirely through military victories, with only the Gibeonites agreeing to peaceful terms with Israel. The land then &quot;had rest from war&quot; (Joshua 11:23, repeated at 14:15). Chapter 12 lists the vanquished kings on both sides of the Jordan River: the two kings who ruled east of the Jordan who were defeated under Moses&#x27; leadership (Joshua 12:1–6; cf. Numbers 21), and the 31 kings on the west of the Jordan who were defeated under Joshua&#x27;s leadership (Joshua 12:7–24). The list of the 31 kings is quasi-tabular:

:&quot;the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one&quot;;
:&quot;the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one&quot;; (etc.; Joshua 12:10–11).

==== Division of the land (chapters 13–22) ====
Having described how the Israelites and Joshua have carried out the first of their God&#x27;s commands, the narrative now turns to the second: to &quot;put the people in possession of the land.&quot; Joshua is &quot;old, advanced (or stricken) in years&quot; by this time.

This land distribution is a &quot;covenantal land grant&quot;: Yahweh, as king, is issuing each tribe its territory. The &quot;Cities of Refuge&quot; and Levitical cities are attached to the end, since it is necessary for the tribes to receive their grants before they allocate parts of it to others. The Transjordanian tribes are dismissed, affirming their loyalty to Yahweh.

The book reaffirms Moses&#x27; allocation of land east of the Jordan to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and then describes how Joshua divided the newly conquered land of Canaan into parcels, and assigned them to the tribes by lot. Joshua 14:1 also makes reference to the role of Eleazar the priest (ahead of Joshua) in the distribution process. The description serves a theological function to show how the promise of the land was realized in the biblical narrative; its origins are unclear, but the descriptions may reflect geographical relations among the places named.

The wording of Joshua 18:1–4 suggests that the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Judah, Ephraim and Manasseh received their land allocation some time before the &quot;remaining seven tribes&quot;, and a 21-member expedition set out to survey the remainder of the land with a view to organising the allocation to the tribes of Simeon, Benjamin, Asher, Naphtali, Zebulun, Issachar and Dan. Subsequently, 48 cities with their surrounding lands were allocated to the Tribe of Levi.

Omitted in the Masoretic Text, but present in the Septuagint, is a statement that:
By the end of chapter 21, the narrative records that the fulfilment of God&#x27;s promise of land, rest and supremacy over the enemies of the Israelites was complete. The tribes to whom Moses had granted land east of the Jordan are authorized to return home to Gilead (here used in the widest sense for the whole Transjordan district), having faithfully &#x27;kept the charge&#x27; of supporting the tribes occupying Canaan. They are granted &quot;riches... with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing&quot; as a reward.

==== Joshua&#x27;s farewell speeches (chapters 23–24) ====
Joshua, in his old age and conscious that he is &quot;going the way of all the earth&quot;, gathers the leaders of the Israelites together and reminds them of Yahweh&#x27;s great works for them, and of the need to love Yahweh. The Israelites are told – just as Joshua himself had been told – that they must comply with &quot;all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses&quot;, neither &quot;turn[ing] aside from it to the right hand or to the left&quot; (i.e. by adding to the law, or diminishing from it).

Joshua meets again with all the people at Shechem in chapter 24 and addresses them a second time. He recounts the history of God&#x27;s formation of the Israelite nation, beginning with &quot;Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, [who] lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods.&quot; He invited the Israelites to choose between serving the Lord who had delivered them from Egypt, or the gods which their ancestors had served on the other side of the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land they now lived. The people chose to serve the Lord, a decision which Joshua recorded in the Book of the Law of God. He then erected a memorial stone &quot;under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord&quot; in Shechem. The oak is associated with the Oak of Moreh where Abram had set up camp during his travels in this area. Thus &quot;Joshua made a covenant with the people&quot;, literally &quot;cut a covenant&quot;, a phrase common to the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages. It derives from the custom of sacrifice, in which the victims were cut in pieces and offered to the deity invoked in ratification of the engagement.

The people then returned to their inheritance, i.e., their allocated lands.

==== Closing items ====
The Book of Joshua closes with three concluding items (referred to in the Jerusalem Bible as &quot;Two Additions&quot;):
:The death of Joshua and his burial at Timnath-serah
:The burial of the bones of Joseph at Shechem
:The death of Eleazar and his burial in land belonging to Phinehas in the mountains of Ephraim.

There were no Levitical cities given to the descendants of Aaron in Ephraim, so theologians Carl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delitzsch supposed the land may have been at Geba in the territory of the Tribe of Benjamin: &quot;the situation, &#x27;upon the mountains of Ephraim&#x27;, is not at variance with this view, as these mountains extended, according to Judges 4:5, etc., far into the territory of Benjamin&quot;.

In some manuscripts and editions of the Septuagint, there is an additional verse relating to the apostasy of the Israelites after Joshua&#x27;s death.

== Composition ==
=== Authorship and date ===
The Book of Joshua is an anonymous work. The Babylonian Talmud, written in the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, attributed it to Joshua himself, but this idea was rejected as untenable by John Calvin (1509–64), and by the time of Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) it was recognised that the book must have been written much later than the period it depicted. There is now general agreement that it was composed as part of a larger work, the Deuteronomistic history, stretching from the Book of Deuteronomy to the Books of Kings, composed first at the court of king Josiah in the late 7th century BCE, and extensively revised in the 6th century BCE.

=== Historicity ===

The prevailing scholarly view is that Joshua is not a factual account of historical events. The apparent setting of Joshua in the 13th century BCE corroborates with the Bronze Age Collapse, which was indeed a time of widespread city-destruction. However, with a few exceptions (Hazor, Lachish), the destroyed cities are not the ones the Bible associates with Joshua, and the ones it does associate with him show little or no sign of even being occupied at the time. The archaeological evidence shows that Jericho and Ai were not occupied in the Near Eastern Late Bronze Age, although recent excavations at Jericho have questioned this.

According to &quot;Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible&quot;, the story of the conquest represents the nationalist propaganda of the 8th century BCE kings of Judah and their claims to the territory of the Kingdom of Israel; incorporated into an early form of Joshua written late in the reign of king Josiah (reigned 640–609 BCE). The Book of Joshua was probably revised and completed after the fall of Jerusalem to the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, and possibly after the return from the Babylonian exile in 538 BCE.

In the 1930s Martin Noth made a sweeping criticism of the usefulness of the Book of Joshua for history. Noth was a student of Albrecht Alt, who emphasized form criticism (whose pioneer had been Hermann Gunkel in the 19th century) and the importance of etiology. Alt and Noth posited a peaceful movement of the Israelites into various areas of Canaan, in contradiction to the Biblical account. American archaeologist William F. Albright questioned the &quot;tenacity&quot; of etiologies, which were key to Noth&#x27;s analysis of the campaigns in Joshua.

The site of Et-Tell (identified as Ai) was first excavated by Judith Marquet-Krause. Her investigations in the 1930s showed that the city, an early target for conquest in the putative Joshua account, had existed and been destroyed, but in the 22nd century BCE. Some alternate sites for Ai, such as Khirbet el-Maqatir or Khirbet Nisya, have been proposed which would partially resolve the discrepancy in dates, but these sites have not been widely accepted. In 1951, Kathleen Kenyon showed that City IV at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) was destroyed at the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2100–1550 BCE), not during the Late Bronze Age (c. 1550–1200 BCE). Kenyon argued that the early Israelite campaign could not be historically corroborated, but rather explained as an etiology of the location and a representation of the Israelite settlement.

More recently, Lorenzo Nigro of the Italian-Palestinian Expedition to Tell es-Sultan has argued that there was a later settlement (City V) at the site during the 14th and 13th centuries BCE. He states that the expedition detected Late Bronze Age II layers in several parts of the tell, although its upper layers were heavily cut by leveling operations during the Iron Age, which explains the low amount of 13th-century materials. Nigro says that the idea that the Biblical account should have a literal archaeological correspondence is erroneous, and &quot;any attempt to seriously identify something on the ground with biblical personages and their acts&quot; is hazardous.

In 1955, G. Ernest Wright discussed the correlation of archaeological data to the early Israelite campaigns, which he divided into three phases per the Book of Joshua. He pointed to two sets of archaeological findings that &quot;seem to suggest that the biblical account is in general correct regarding the nature of the late thirteenth and twelfth-eleventh centuries in the country&quot; (i.e., &quot;a period of tremendous violence&quot;). He gives particular weight to what were then recent digs at Hazor by Yigael Yadin.

Archaeologist Amnon Ben-Tor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who replaced Yadin as the supervisor of excavations at Hazor in 1990, believed that recently unearthed evidence of violent destruction by burning verifies the Biblical account of the city&#x27;s conquest by the Israelites. In 2012, a team led by Ben-Tor and Sharon Zuckerman discovered a scorched palace from the 13th century BC in whose storerooms they found 3,400-year-old ewers holding burned crops. Sharon Zuckerman did not agree with Ben-Tor&#x27;s theory, and claimed that the burning was the result of the city&#x27;s numerous factions opposing each other with excessive force.

In her commentary for the &quot;Westminster Bible Companion series,&quot; Carolyn Pressler suggested that readers of Joshua should give priority to its theological message (&quot;what passages teach about God&quot;) and be aware of what these would have meant to audiences in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE. Richard Nelson explained that the needs of the centralised monarchy favoured a single story of origins, combining old traditions of an exodus from Egypt, belief in a national god as &quot;divine warrior,&quot; and explanations for ruined cities, social stratification and ethnic groups, and contemporary tribes.

Lester L. Grabbe states that when he was studying for his doctorate (more than three decades before 2007), the &quot;substantial historicity&quot; of the Bible&#x27;s stories of the patriarchs and the conquest of Canaan was widely accepted, but today it is hard to find a historian who still believes in it.

According to Ann E. Killebrew, &quot;Most scholars today accept that the majority of the conquest narratives in the book of Joshua are devoid of historical reality&quot;.

In 2005, Pierre de Miroschedji published an article in the journal &quot;La Recherche&quot;. He wrote: 

The consensus of historians is that the ancient Israelites did not enter Canaan from outside and did not conquer it in a military campaign.

===Manuscripts===

Fragments of Joshua dating to the Hasmonean period were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (4QJosha and 4QJoshb, found in Qumran Cave 4).
The Septuagint (Greek translation) is found in manuscripts such as Washington Manuscript I (5th century CE), and a reduced version of the Septuagint text is found in the illustrated Joshua Roll. The earliest complete copy of the book in Hebrew is in the Aleppo Codex (10th century CE).

== Themes ==
=== Faith and wrath ===
The overarching theological theme of the Deuteronomistic history is faithfulness and God&#x27;s mercy, and their opposites, faithlessness and God&#x27;s wrath. In the Book of Judges, the Books of Samuel, and the Books of Kings, the Israelites become faithless and God ultimately shows his anger by sending his people into exile. But in Joshua Israel is obedient, Joshua is faithful, and God fulfills his promise and gives them the land as a result. Yahweh&#x27;s war campaign in Canaan validates Israel&#x27;s entitlement to the land and provides a paradigm of how Israel was to live there: twelve tribes, with a designated leader, united by covenant in warfare and in worship of Yahweh alone at a single sanctuary, all in obedience to the commands of Moses as found in the Book of Deuteronomy.

=== God and Israel ===

The Book of Joshua takes forward Deuteronomy&#x27;s theme of Israel as a single people worshipping Yahweh in the land God has given them. Yahweh, as the main character in the book, takes the initiative in conquering the land, and Yahweh&#x27;s power wins the battles. For example, the walls of Jericho fall because Yahweh fights for Israel, not because the Israelites show superior fighting ability. The potential disunity of Israel is a constant theme, the greatest threat of disunity coming from the tribes east of the Jordan. Chapter 22:19 even hints that the land across the Jordan is unclean and that the tribes who live there have secondary status.

=== Land ===

Land is the central topic of Joshua. The introduction to Deuteronomy recalled how Yahweh had given the land to the Israelites but then withdrew the gift when Israel showed fear and only Joshua and Caleb had trusted in God. The land is Yahweh&#x27;s to give or to withhold, and the fact that he has promised it to Israel gives Israel an inalienable right to take it. For exilic and post-exilic readers, the land was both the sign of Yahweh&#x27;s faithfulness and Israel&#x27;s unfaithfulness, as well as the centre of their ethnic identity. In Deuteronomistic theology, &quot;rest&quot; meant Israel&#x27;s unthreatened possession of the land, the achievement of which began with the conquests of Joshua.

=== The enemy ===
Joshua &quot;carries out a systematic campaign against the civilians of Canaan – men, women and children – that amounts to genocide.&quot; This practice was known as &quot;herem&quot;, as described in Deuteronomy 20:17, which entailed no treaties with the enemy, no mercy, and no intermarriage. &quot;The extermination of the nations glorifies Yahweh as a warrior and promotes Israel&#x27;s claim to the land,&quot; while their continued survival &quot;explores the themes of disobedience and penalty and looks forward to the story told in Judges and Kings.&quot; The divine call for massacre at Jericho and elsewhere can be explained in terms of cultural norms (Israel was not the only Iron Age state to practice &quot;herem&quot;) and theology (e.g. to ensure Israel&#x27;s purity, fulfill God&#x27;s promise, judge the Canaanites for their &quot;sexual misconduct&quot;).

Patrick D. Miller in his commentary on Deuteronomy, writes that &quot;there is no real way to make such reports palatable to the hearts and minds of contemporary readers and believers,&quot; and that the &quot;tension between the Israelites and its neighbors was fundamentally a religious conflict,&quot; writing further for the need to understand what the reports teach &quot;so that they make some sense to us in the whole.&quot; Miller writes further that the &quot;Deuteronomistic history in Joshua through Second Kings is a story of constant or recurring apostasy&quot; and that for the Israelites, maintaining their allegiance with Yahweh &quot;required, in their sight, removal of all temptation.&quot; Nissim Amzallag sees similarities between Joshua&#x27;s conquest and the return of Judean exiles in Ezra-Nehemiah but compared to the former, the Judeans merely refrained from intermarrying the &quot;Canaanites&quot;. These &quot;Canaanites&quot; were most likely non-exiled Judeans, who were contaminated with &quot;foreign influence&quot;.

=== Obedience ===

Obedience versus disobedience is a constant theme of the work. Obedience ties in the Jordan crossing, the defeat of Jericho and Ai, circumcision and Passover, and the public display and reading of the Law. Disobedience appears in the story of Achan (stoned for violating the &quot;herem&quot; command), the Gibeonites, and the altar built by the Transjordan tribes. Joshua&#x27;s two final addresses challenge the Israel of the future (the readers of the story) to obey the most important command of all, to worship Yahweh and no other gods. Joshua thus illustrates the central Deuteronomistic message, that obedience leads to success and disobedience to ruin.

=== Moses, Joshua and Josiah ===
The Deuteronomistic history draws parallels in proper leadership between Moses, Joshua and Josiah. God&#x27;s commission to Joshua in chapter 1 is framed as a royal installation. The people&#x27;s pledge of loyalty to Joshua as the successor of Moses recalls royal practices. The covenant-renewal ceremony led by Joshua was the prerogative of the kings of Judah. God&#x27;s command to Joshua to meditate on the &quot;book of the law&quot; day and night parallels the description of Josiah in 2 Kings 23:25 as a king uniquely concerned with the study of the law. The two figures had identical territorial goals; Josiah died in 609 BCE while attempting to annex the former Israel to his own kingdom of Judah.

Some of the parallels with Moses can be seen in the following, and not exhaustive, list:
* Joshua sent spies to scout out the land near Jericho, just as Moses sent spies from the wilderness to scout out the Promised Land
* Joshua led the Israelites out of the wilderness into the Promised Land, crossing the Jordan River as if on dry ground, just as Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt through the Red Sea, which they crossed as if on dry land
* After crossing the Jordan River, the Israelites celebrated the Passover just as they did immediately before the Exodus
* Joshua&#x27;s vision of the &quot;commander of Yahweh&#x27;s army&quot; is reminiscent of the divine revelation to Moses in the burning bush
* Joshua successfully intercedes on behalf of the Israelites when Yahweh is angry for their failure to fully observe the &quot;ban&quot; (herem), just as Moses frequently persuaded God not to punish the people
* Joshua and the Israelites were able to defeat the people at Ai because Joshua followed the divine instruction to extend his sword, just as the people were able to defeat the Amalekites as long as Moses extended his hand that held the staff of God
* Joshua is &quot;old, advanced in years&quot; at the time when the Israelites can begin to settle on the promised land, just as Moses was old when he died having seen, but not entered, the Promised Land
* Joshua served as the mediator of the renewed covenant between Yahweh and Israel at Shechem, just as Moses was the mediator of Yahweh&#x27;s covenant with the people at Mount Sinai/Mount Horeb.
* Before his death, Joshua delivered a farewell address to the Israelites, just as Moses had delivered his farewell address.
* Moses lived to be 120 and Joshua lived to be 110.

== Moral and political interpretations ==

The Book of Joshua deals with the conquest of the Land of Israel and its settlement, which are politically charged issues in Israeli society. In her article &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Book of Joshua in Public Education in the Light of Ideological Changes in Israeli Society,&quot; Israeli biblical scholar Leah Mazor analyzes the history of the book and reveals a complex system of references to it expressed in a wide range of responses, often extreme, moving from narrow-minded admiration, through embarrassment and thunderous silence to a bitter and poignant critique. The changes in the status of the Book of Joshua, she shows, are the manifestations of the ongoing dialogue that Israeli society has with its cultural heritage, with its history, with the Zionist idea, and with the need to redefine its identity.

David Ben-Gurion saw in the war narrative of Joshua an ideal basis for a unifying national myth for the State of Israel, framed against a common enemy, the Arabs. He met with politicians and scholars such as Biblical scholar Shemaryahu Talmon to discuss Joshua&#x27;s supposed conquests and later published a book of the meeting transcripts; in a lecture at Ben-Gurion&#x27;s home, archaeologist Yigael Yadin argued for the historicity of the Israelite military campaign pointing to the conquests of Hazor, Bethel, and Lachish. Palestinian writer Nur Masalha claimed that Zionism had presented the 1948 Arab-Israeli War (which saw the creation of the State of Israel) as a &quot;miraculous&quot; clearing of the land based on Joshua, and the Bible as a mandate for the expulsion of the Palestinians.

The biblical narrative of conquest has been used as an apparatus of critique against Zionism. For example, Michael Prior criticizes the use of the campaign in Joshua to favor &quot;colonial enterprises&quot; (in general, not only Zionism), which have been interpreted as validating ethnic cleansing. He asserts that the Bible was used to make the mistreatment of Palestinians more morally palatable. A related moral condemnation can be seen in &quot;The political sacralization of imperial genocide: contextualizing Timothy Dwight&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Canaan&quot;&quot; by Bill Templer. This kind of critique is not new; Jonathan Boyarin notes how Frederick W. Turner blamed Israel&#x27;s monotheism for the very idea of genocide, which Boyarin found &quot;simplistic&quot; yet with precedents. In her tenure as Minister of Education, Israeli leftist politician Shulamit Aloni often complained about the centrality of the book of Joshua in the curricula, as opposed to the secondaryness of humane and universal principles found in the Books of the Prophets. Her attempt to change the Bible study program was unsuccessful.

Harvard Bible professor and conservative Rabbi Shaye J. D. Cohen stated he is not happy with the genocide chapters being part of the Torah, and he would remove those from it, if it were his choice.

<text>The Book of Ezra is a book of the Hebrew Bible which formerly included the Book of Nehemiah in a single book, commonly distinguished in scholarship as Ezra–Nehemiah. The two became separated with the first printed rabbinic bibles of the early 16th century, following late medieval Latin Christian tradition. Composed in Hebrew and Aramaic, its subject is the Return to Zion following the close of the Babylonian captivity. Together with the Book of Nehemiah, it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible.

The Book of Ezra is divided into two parts: the first telling the story of the first return of exiles in the first year of Cyrus the Great (538 BC) and the completion and dedication of the new Temple in Jerusalem in the sixth year of Darius I (515 BC); the second telling of the subsequent mission of Ezra to Jerusalem and his struggle to purify the Jews from marriage with non-Jews.

In the book&#x27;s recurring narrative pattern, the God of Israel three times inspires a king of Persia to commission a leader from among the Jews to carry out a mission: the first to rebuild the Temple, the second to purify the Jewish community, and the third to seal the holy city behind a wall. This third mission, that of Nehemiah, is not part of the Book of Ezra.

There is no historical consensus on Ezra’s existence or mission due to a lack of extrabiblical evidence and conflicting scholarly interpretations, ranging from viewing him as a historical Aramean official to a literary figure, with debates hinging on the authenticity of the Artaxerxes rescript and its dating.

== Summary ==
The Book of Ezra consists of ten chapters: chapters 1–6, covering the period from the Cyrus the Great to the dedication of the Second Temple, are told in the third person. Chapters 7–10, dealing with the mission of Ezra, are told largely in the first person. The book contains several documents presented as historical inclusions, written in Aramaic while the surrounding text is in Hebrew (1:2–4, 4:8–16, 4:17–22, 5:7–17, 6:3–5, 6:6–12, 7:12–26) 

;&quot;Chapters 1–6 (documents included in the text in italics)&quot;
*1. &quot;Decree of Cyrus, first version&quot;: Cyrus, inspired by God, returns the Temple vessels to Sheshbazzar, &quot;prince of Judah&quot;, and directs the Israelites to return to Jerusalem with him and rebuild the Temple.
*2. 42,360 exiles, with men servants, women servants and &quot;singing men and women&quot;, return from Babylon to Jerusalem and Judah under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Jeshua the High Priest.
*3. Jeshua the High Priest and Zerubbabel build the altar and celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. In the second year the foundations of the Temple are laid and the dedication takes place with great rejoicing.

*4. &quot;Letter of the Samaritans to Artaxerxes, and reply of Artaxerxes&quot;: The &quot;enemies of Judah and Benjamin&quot; offer to help with the rebuilding, but are rebuffed; they then work to frustrate the builders &quot;down to the reign of Darius.&quot; The officials of Samaria write to king Artaxerxes warning him that Jerusalem is being rebuilt, and the king orders the work to stop. The narrative then returns to the times of Darius I. &quot;Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.&quot;
*5. &quot;Tattenai&#x27;s letter to Darius&quot;: Through the exhortations of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, Zerubbabel and Joshua recommence the building of the Temple. Tattenai, satrap over both Judah and Samaria, writes to Darius warning him that Jerusalem is being rebuilt and advising that the archives be searched to discover the decree of Cyrus.
*6. &quot;Decree of Cyrus, second version, and decree of Darius&quot;: Darius finds the decree, directs Tattenai not to disturb the Jews in their work, and exempts them from tribute and supplies everything necessary for the offerings. The Temple is finished in the month of Adar in the sixth year of Darius, and the Israelites assemble to celebrate its completion.

;&quot;Chapters 7–10&quot;
*7. &quot;Letter of Artaxerxes to Ezra (Artaxerxes&#x27; rescript)&quot;: King Artaxerxes is moved by God to commission Ezra &quot;to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God&quot; and to &quot;appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God.&quot; Artaxerxes gives Ezra much gold and directs all Persian officials to aid him.

*8. Ezra gathers a large body of returnees and much gold and silver and precious vessels for the Temple and camps by a canal outside Babylon. There he discovers he has no Levites, and so sends messengers to gather some. The exiles then return to Jerusalem, where they distribute the gold and silver and offer sacrifices to God.
*9. Ezra is informed that some of the Jews already in Jerusalem have married non-Jewish women. Ezra is appalled at this proof of sin, and prays to God: &quot;O God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.&quot;
*10. Despite the opposition of some of their number, the Israelites assemble and send away their foreign wives and children.

== Historical background ==

In the early 6th century BC, the Kingdom of Judah rebelled against the Neo-Babylonian Empire and was destroyed. As a result, the royal court, the priests, the prophets and scribes were taken into captivity in the city of Babylon. There a profound intellectual revolution took place, the exiles blaming their fate on disobedience to their God and looking forward to a future when he would allow a purified people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. The same period saw the rapid rise of Persia, previously an unimportant kingdom in present-day southern Iran, to a position of great power, and in 539 BC Cyrus II, the Persian ruler, conquered Babylon.

It is difficult to describe the parties and politics of Judea in this period because of the lack of historical sources, but there seem to have been three important groups involved: the returnees from the exile who claimed the reconstruction with the support of Cyrus II; &quot;the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin&quot;; and a third group, &quot;people of the land&quot;, who seem to be local opposition against the returnees building the Temple in Jerusalem.

The following table is a guide to major events in the region during the period covered by the Book of Ezra:
== Texts ==

===Ezra–Nehemiah===

The single Hebrew book Ezra–Nehemiah, with title &quot;Ezra&quot;, was translated into Greek around the middle of the 2nd century BC. The Septuagint names Ezra–Nehemiah and 1 Esdras Esdras B and A respectively. This usage is noted by the early Christian scholar Origen, who remarked that the Hebrew &#x27;book of Ezra&#x27; might then be considered a &#x27;double&#x27; book.

Jerome, writing in the early 5th century, noted that this duplication had since been adopted by Greek and Latin Christians. Jerome himself rejected the duplication in his Vulgate translation of the Bible into Latin from the Hebrew. Consequently, all early Vulgate manuscripts present Ezra-Nehemiah as a single book.

From the 9th century onwards, Latin bibles are found that for the first time separate the Ezra and Nehemiah sections of Ezra-Nehemiah as two distinct books, then called the first and second books of Ezra. This becomes standard in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century. It was not until 1516/17, in the first printed Rabbinic Bible of Daniel Bomberg that the separation was introduced generally in Hebrew Bibles.

===First Esdras===
1 Esdras, also known as &quot;Esdras α&quot;, is an alternate Greek-language version of Ezra. This text has one additional section, the &#x27;Tale of the Three Guardsmen&#x27; in the middle of Ezra 4. 1 Esdras (3 Esdras in the Vulgate) was considered apocryphal by Jerome.

== Date, structure and composition ==

===Date===

Koresh of Ezra 1:1 is called &quot;king of Persia&quot;, which title was introduced by Cyrus the Great some time after he defeated Astyages of Media (585–550 BC).

Scholars are divided over the chronological sequence of the activities of Ezra and Nehemiah. Ezra 7:8 says that Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the seventh year of king Artaxerxes, while Nehemiah 2:1–9 has Nehemiah arriving in Artaxerxes&#x27; twentieth year. If this was Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC), then Ezra arrived in 458 and Nehemiah in 445 BC. Nehemiah 8–9, in which the two (possibly by editorial error) appear together, supports this scenario.

===Structure===
The contents of Ezra–Nehemiah are structured in a theological rather than chronological order: &quot;The Temple must come first, then the purifying of the community, then the building of the outer walls of the city, and so finally all could reach a grand climax in the reading of the law.&quot;

The narrative follows a repeating pattern in which the God of Israel &quot;stirs up&quot; the king of Persia to commission a Jewish leader (Zerubbabel, Ezra, Nehemiah) to undertake a mission; the leader completes his mission in the face of opposition; and success is marked by a great assembly. The tasks of the three leaders are progressive: first the Temple is restored (Zerubabbel), then the community of Israel (Ezra), and finally the walls which will separate the purified community and Temple from the outside world (Nehemiah).

The pattern is completed with a final coda in which Nehemiah restores the belief of Yahweh. This concern with a schematic pattern-making, rather than with history in the modern sense of a factual account of events in the order in which they occurred, explains the origin of the many problems which surround both Ezra and Nehemiah as historical sources.

===Composition===
Twentieth-century views on the composition of Ezra revolved around whether the author was Ezra himself, and who may have also authored the Books of Chronicles, or was another author or authors who also wrote the Chronicles. More recently it has been increasingly recognised that Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles all have extremely complex histories stretching over many stages of editing, and most scholars now are cautious of assuming a unified composition with a single theology and point of view. As an indication of the many layers of editing which Ezra has undergone, one recent study finds that Ezra 1–6 and Ezra 9–10 were originally separate documents, that they were spliced together at a later stage by the authors of Ezra 7–8, and that all have undergone extensive later editing.

Tamara Cohn Eskenazi argues that the final composition of Ezra took place during the late Persian period (c. 370-350 BCE), with some small additions from the Hellenistic period. She states that the language and ideology of the book seem to best fit within a Persian-period context.

== Persian documents ==
Seven purported Persian decrees of kings or letters to and from high officials are quoted in Ezra. Their authenticity has been contentious. While some scholars accept them in their current form, most accept only part of them as genuine, while still others reject them entirely. L.L. Grabbe surveyed six tests against which the documents can be measured (comparative known Persian material, linguistic details, contents, presence of Jewish theology, the Persian attitude to local religions, and Persian letter-writing formulas) and concluded that all the documents are late post-Persian works and probable forgeries, but that some features suggest a genuine Persian correspondence behind some of them. By contrast, Richard C. Steiner and H. G. M. Williamson argue that the linguistic and other evidence suggests that the documents are authentic.

<doc id="4333" wikidata="Q80115" url="?curid=4333" title="Book of Daniel">
<text>The Book of Daniel is a 2nd-century BC biblical apocalypse with a 6th-century BC setting. Ostensibly &quot;an account of the activities and visions of Daniel, a noble Jew exiled at Babylon&quot;, the text features a prophecy rooted in Jewish history, as well as a portrayal of the end times that is both cosmic in scope and political in its focus. The message of the text intended for the original audience was that just as the God of Israel saves Daniel from his enemies so that he would save the Israelites in their present oppression.

The Hebrew Bible includes Daniel as one of the Ketuvim, while Christian biblical canons group the work with the major prophets. It divides into two parts: a set of six court tales in chapters 1–6, written mostly in Biblical Aramaic, and four apocalyptic visions in chapters 7–12, written mainly in Late Biblical Hebrew; the deuterocanonical books contain three additional sections, the Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon.

The book&#x27;s themes have resonated throughout the ages, including with the community of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the authors of the canonical gospels and the Book of Revelation. From the 2nd century to the modern era, religious movements, including the Reformation and later millennialist movements, have been deeply influenced by it.
== Structure ==
=== Divisions ===
The Book of Daniel is divided between the court tales of chapters 1–6 and the apocalyptic visions of 7–12, and between the Hebrew of chapters 1 and 8–12 and the Aramaic of chapters 2–7. The division is reinforced by the chiastic arrangement of the Aramaic chapters (see below), and by a chronological progression in chapters 1–6 from Babylonian to Median rule, and from Babylonian to Persian rule in chapters 7–12. Various suggestions have been made by scholars to explain the fact that the genre division does not coincide with the other two, but it appears that the language division and concentric structure of chapters 2–6 are artificial literary devices designed to bind the two halves of the book together. The following outline is provided by Collins in his commentary on Daniel:

PART I: Tales (chapters 1:1–6:29)
*1: Introduction (1:1–21 – set in the Babylonian era, written in Hebrew)
*2: Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dream of four kingdoms (2:1–49 – Babylonian era; Aramaic)
*3: The fiery furnace (3:1–30/3:1-23, 91-97 – Babylonian era; Aramaic)
*4: Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s madness (3:31/98–4:34/4:1-37 – Babylonian era; Aramaic)
*5: Belshazzar&#x27;s feast (5:1–6:1 – Babylonian era; Aramaic)
*6: Daniel in the lions&#x27; den (6:2–29 – Median era with mention of Persia; Aramaic)
PART II: Visions (chapters 7:1–12:13)
*7: The beasts from the sea (7:1–28 – Babylonian era: Aramaic)
*8: The ram and the he-goat (8:1–27 – Babylonian era; Hebrew)
*9: Interpretation of the seventy weeks&#x27; prophecy (9:1–27 – Median era; Hebrew)
*10: The angel&#x27;s revelation: kings of the north and south (10:1–12:13 – Persian era, mention of Greek era; Hebrew)

=== Chiastic structure in the Aramaic section ===

There is a recognised chiasm (a concentric literary structure in which the main point of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by parallel elements on either side in &quot;ABBA&quot; fashion) in the chapter arrangement of the Aramaic section. The following is taken from Paul Redditt&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to the Prophets&quot;:

* A1 (2:4b-49) – A dream of four kingdoms replaced by a fifth
** B1 (3:1–30) – Daniel&#x27;s three friends in the fiery furnace
*** C1 (4:1–37) – Daniel interprets a dream for Nebuchadnezzar
*** C2 (5:1–31) – Daniel interprets the handwriting on the wall for Belshazzar
** B2 (6:1–28) – Daniel in the lions&#x27; den
* A2 (7:1–28) – A vision of four world kingdoms replaced by a fifth

== Content ==

=== Introduction in Babylon (chapter 1) ===
In the third year of King Jehoiakim, God allows Jerusalem to fall into the power of Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon. Young Israelites of noble and royal family, &quot;without physical defect, and handsome,&quot; versed in wisdom and competent to serve in the palace of the king, are taken to Babylon to be taught the literature and language of that nation. Among them are Daniel and his three companions, who refuse to touch the royal food and wine. Their overseer fears for his life in case the health of his charges deteriorates, but Daniel suggests a trial and the four emerge healthier than their counterparts from ten days of consuming nothing but vegetables and water. They are allowed to continue to refrain from eating the king&#x27;s food, and to Daniel, God gives insight into visions and dreams. When their training is done Nebuchadnezzar finds them &#x27;ten times better&#x27; than all the wise men in his service and therefore keeps them at his court, where Daniel continues until the first year of King Cyrus.

=== Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dream of four kingdoms (chapter 2) ===

In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar has a dream. When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some important message, so he consults his wise men. Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation, the king refuses to tell the wise men what he saw in his dream. Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth. Daniel explains the dream to the king: the statue symbolized four successive kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar, all of which would be crushed by God&#x27;s kingdom, which would endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel&#x27;s god, raises Daniel over all his wise men, and places Daniel and his companions over the province of Babylon.

=== The fiery furnace (chapter 3) ===

Daniel&#x27;s companions Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse to bow to King Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s golden statue and are thrown into a fiery furnace. Nebuchadnezzar is astonished to see a fourth figure in the furnace with the three, one &quot;with the appearance like a son of the gods.&quot; So the king calls the three to come out of the fire, blesses the God of Israel, and decrees that any who blaspheme against him shall be torn limb from limb.

=== Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s madness (chapter 4) ===
Nebuchadnezzar recounts a dream of a huge tree that is suddenly cut down at the command of a heavenly messenger. Daniel is summoned and interprets the dream. The tree is Nebuchadnezzar himself, who for seven years will lose his mind and live like a wild beast. All of this comes to pass until, at the end of the specified time, Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges that &quot;heaven rules&quot; and his kingdom and sanity are restored.

=== Belshazzar&#x27;s feast (chapter 5) ===
Belshazzar and his nobles blasphemously drink from sacred Jewish temple vessels, offering praise to inanimate gods, until a mysterious hand suddenly appears and writes upon the wall. The horrified king summons Daniel, who upbraids him for his lack of humility before God and interprets the message: Belshazzar&#x27;s kingdom will be given to the Medes and Persians. Belshazzar rewards Daniel and raises him to be third in the kingdom, and that very night Belshazzar is slain and Darius the Mede takes the kingdom.

=== Daniel in the lions&#x27; den (chapter 6) ===

Darius elevates Daniel to high office, exciting the jealousy of other officials. Knowing of Daniel&#x27;s devotion to his God, his enemies trick the king into issuing an edict forbidding worship of any other god or man for a 30-day period. Daniel continues to pray three times a day to God towards Jerusalem; he is accused and King Darius, forced by his own decree, throws Daniel into the lions&#x27; den. But God shuts up the mouths of the lions, and the next morning Darius rejoices to find him unharmed. The king casts Daniel&#x27;s accusers into the lions&#x27; pit together with their wives and children to be instantly devoured, while he himself acknowledges Daniel&#x27;s God as he whose kingdom shall never be destroyed.

=== Vision of the beasts from the sea (chapter 7) ===
In the first year of Belshazzar Daniel has a dream of four monstrous beasts arising from the sea. The fourth, a beast with ten horns, devours the whole earth, treading it down and crushing it, and a further small horn appears and uproots three of the earlier horns. The Ancient of Days judges and destroys the beast, and &quot;one like a son of man&quot; is given everlasting kingship over the entire world. One of Daniel&#x27;s attendants explains that the four beasts represent four kings, but that &quot;the holy ones of the Most High&quot; would receive the everlasting kingdom. The fourth beast would be a fourth kingdom with ten kings, and another king who would pull down three kings and make war on the &quot;holy ones&quot; for &quot;a time, two times and a half,&quot; after which the heavenly judgment will be made against him and the &quot;holy ones&quot; will receive the everlasting kingdom.

=== Vision of the ram and goat (chapter 8) ===

In the third year of Belshazzar Daniel has a vision of a ram and goat. The ram has two mighty horns, one longer than the other, and it charges west, north and south, overpowering all other beasts. A goat with a single horn appears from the west and destroys the ram. The goat becomes very powerful until the horn breaks off and is replaced by four lesser horns. A small horn that grows very large, it stops the daily temple sacrifices and desecrates the sanctuary for two thousand three hundred &quot;evenings and mornings&quot; (which could be either 1,150 or 2,300 days) until the temple is cleansed. The angel Gabriel informs him that the ram represents the Medes and Persians, the goat is Greece, and the &quot;little horn&quot; is a wicked king.

=== Vision of the Seventy Weeks (chapter 9) ===

In the first year of Darius the Mede, Daniel meditates on the word of Jeremiah that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years; he confesses the sin of Israel and pleads for God to restore Israel and the &quot;desolated sanctuary&quot; of the Temple. The angel Gabriel explains that the seventy years stand for seventy &quot;weeks&quot; of years (490 years), during which the Temple will first be restored, then later defiled by a &quot;prince who is to come,&quot; &quot;until the decreed end is poured out.&quot;

=== Vision of the kings of north and south (chapters 10–12) ===

Daniel 10: In the third year of Cyrus Daniel sees in his vision an angel (called &quot;a man&quot;, but clearly a supernatural being) who explains that he is in the midst of a war with the &quot;prince of Persia&quot;, assisted only by Michael, &quot;your prince.&quot; The &quot;prince of Greece&quot; will shortly come, but first he will reveal what will happen to Daniel&#x27;s people.

Daniel 11: A future king of Persia will make war on the king of Greece, a &quot;mighty king&quot; will arise and wield power until his empire is broken up and given to others, and finally the king of the south (identified in verse 8 as Egypt) will go to war with the &quot;king of the north.&quot; After many battles (described in great detail) a &quot;contemptible person&quot; will become king of the north; this king will invade the south two times, the first time with success, but on his second he will be stopped by &quot;ships of Kittim.&quot; He will turn back to his own country, and on the way his soldiers will desecrate the Temple, abolish the daily sacrifice, and set up the abomination of desolation. He will defeat and subjugate Libya and Egypt, but &quot;reports from the east and north will alarm him,&quot; and he will meet his end &quot;between the sea and the holy mountain.&quot;

Daniel 12: At this time Michael will come. It will be a time of great distress, but all those whose names are written will be delivered. &quot;Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt; those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.&quot; In the final verses the remaining time to the end is revealed: &quot;a time, times and half a time&quot; (three years and a half). Daniel fails to understand and asks again what will happen, and is told: &quot;From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.&quot;

=== Additions to Daniel (Greek text tradition) ===

The Greek text of Daniel is considerably longer than the Hebrew, due to three additional stories: they remain in Catholic and Orthodox Christian Bibles but were rejected by the Christian Protestant movement in the 16th century on the basis that they were absent from the Hebrew Bible.
* The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children, placed after Daniel 3:23;
* The story of Susanna and the Elders, placed before chapter 1 in some Greek versions and after chapter 12 in others;
* The story of Bel and the Dragon, placed at the end of the book.

The Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter Masoretic Text and in two longer Greek versions, the original Septuagint version, , and the later Theodotion version from . Both Greek texts contain the three additions to Daniel. Theodotion is much closer to the Masoretic Text and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself. The Greek additions were apparently never part of the Hebrew text. Several Old Greek texts of the Book of Daniel have been discovered, and the original form of the book is being reconstructed.

== Historical background ==
The visions of chapters 7–12 reflect the crisis which took place in Judea in 167–164 BC when Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Greek king of the Seleucid Empire, threatened to destroy traditional Jewish worship in Jerusalem. When Antiochus came to the throne in 175 BC the Jews were largely pro-Seleucid. The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest. Jason also asked—or more accurately, paid—to be allowed to make Jerusalem a &quot;polis&quot;, or Greek city. This meant, among other things, that city government would be in the hands of the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a valuable commodity, to be purchased from Jason. None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests. Three years later Jason was deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest.

Antiochus invaded Egypt twice, in 169 BC with success, but on the second incursion, in late 168 BC, he was forced to withdraw by the Romans. Jason, hearing a rumour that Antiochus was dead, attacked Menelaus to take back the High Priesthood. Antiochus drove Jason out of Jerusalem, plundered the Temple, and introduced measures to pacify his Egyptian border by imposing complete Hellenization: the Jewish Book of the Law was prohibited and on 15 December 167 BC an &quot;abomination of desolation&quot;, probably a Greek altar, was introduced into the Temple. With the Jewish religion now clearly under threat a resistance movement sprang up, led by the Maccabee brothers, and over the next three years it won sufficient victories over Antiochus to take back and purify the Temple.

The crisis which the author of Daniel addresses is the defilement of the altar in Jerusalem in 167 BC (first introduced in chapter 8:11): the daily offering which used to take place twice a day, at morning and evening, stopped, and the phrase &quot;evenings and mornings&quot; recurs through the following chapters as a reminder of the missed sacrifices. But whereas the events leading up to the sacking of the Temple in 167 BC and the immediate aftermath are remarkably accurate, the predicted war between the Syrians and the Egyptians (11:40–43) never took place, and the prophecy that Antiochus would die in Palestine (11:44–45) was inaccurate (he died in Persia). The most probable conclusion is that the account must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164 BC, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem, and the consensus of modern scholarship is accordingly that the book dates to the period 167–163 BC.

== Composition ==
=== Development ===

It is generally accepted that Daniel originated as a collection of Aramaic court tales later expanded by the Hebrew revelations. The court tales may have originally circulated independently, but the edited collection was probably composed in the third or early second-century BC. Chapter 1 was composed (in Aramaic) at this time as a brief introduction to provide historical context, introduce the characters of the tales, and explain how Daniel and his friends came to Babylon. The visions of chapters 7–12 were added and chapter 1 translated into Hebrew at the third stage when the final book was being drawn together; this final stage, marking the composition of Daniel as a book, took place between the desecration of the Temple by Antiochus Epiphanies in 167 and his death in 164 BC.

=== Authorship ===
Daniel is a product of &quot;Wisdom&quot; circles, but the type of wisdom is (the discovery of heavenly secrets from earthly signs) rather than the wisdom of learning—the main source of wisdom in Daniel is God&#x27;s revelation. It is one of a large number of Jewish apocalypses, all of them pseudonymous. The stories of the first half are legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the Maccabean period (2nd century BC). Chapters 1–6 are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar; the second half (chapters 7–12) is presented by Daniel himself, introduced by the anonymous narrator in chapters 7 and 10. 

The author/editor was probably an educated Jew, knowledgeable in Greek learning, and of high standing in his own community. It is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition. Ezekiel, who lived during the Babylonian exile, mentioned him in association with Noah and Job (Ezekiel 14:14) as a figure of legendary wisdom (28:3), and a hero named Daniel (more accurately Dan&#x27;el, but the spelling is close enough for the two to be regarded as identical) features in a late 2nd millennium myth from Ugarit. &quot;The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character ... serves as the principal human &#x27;hero&#x27; in the biblical book that now bears his name&quot;; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions from on high that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries.

=== Dating ===

The prophecies of Daniel are accurate down to the career of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, king of Syria and oppressor of the Jews, but not in its prediction of his death: the author seems to know about Antiochus&#x27; two campaigns in Egypt (169 and 167 BC), the desecration of the Temple (the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot;), and the fortification of the Akra (a fortress built inside Jerusalem), but he seems to know nothing about the reconstruction of the Temple or about the actual circumstances of Antiochus&#x27; death in late 164 BC. Chapters 10–12 must therefore have been written between 167 and 164 BC. There is no evidence of a significant time lapse between those chapters and chapters 8 and 9, and chapter 7 may have been written just a few months earlier again.

Some evidence of the book&#x27;s date can be found in the fact that Daniel is not present in the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s canon of the prophets (where it might arguably be expected to fit), which was closed . Rather, Daniel forms a part of the Ketuvim (writings) also formed . Additionally, the Wisdom of Sirach, a work dating from , draws on almost every book of the Old Testament except Daniel, leading scholars to suppose that its author was unaware of it; Daniel is, however, quoted in a section of the Sibylline Oracles commonly dated to the middle of the 2nd century BC, and was popular at Qumran at much the same time, suggesting that it was known from the middle of that century.

== Manuscripts ==
The Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter Masoretic Text and in two longer Greek versions, the original Septuagint version, c. 100 BC, and the later Theodotion version from c. 2nd century AD. Both Greek texts contain three additions to Daniel: The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children; the story of Susannah and the Elders; and the story of Bel and the Dragon. Theodotion is much closer to the Masoretic Text and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself. The Greek additions were apparently never part of the Hebrew text.

Eight copies of the Book of Daniel, all incomplete, have been found at Qumran, two in Cave 1, five in Cave 4, and one in Cave 6. Between them, they preserve text from eleven of Daniel&#x27;s twelve chapters, and the twelfth is quoted in the Florilegium (a compilation scroll) 4Q174, showing that the book at Qumran did not lack this conclusion. All eight manuscripts were copied between 125 BC (4QDanc) and about 50 AD (4QDanb), showing that Daniel was being read at Qumran only about 40 years after its composition. All appear to preserve the 12-chapter Masoretic version rather than the longer Greek text. None reveal any major disagreements against the Masoretic, and the four scrolls that preserve the relevant sections (1QDana, 4QDana, 4QDanb, and 4QDand) all follow the bilingual nature of Daniel where the book opens in Hebrew, switches to Aramaic at 2:4b, then reverts to Hebrew at 8:1.

== Genre, meaning, symbolism and chronology ==
&quot;(This section deals with modern scholarly reconstructions of the meaning of Daniel to its original authors and audience)&quot;
=== Genre ===

The Book of Daniel is an apocalypse, a literary genre in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an other-worldly mediator, an emphasis on cosmic events, angels and demons, and pseudonymity (false authorship). The production of apocalypses occurred commonly from 300 BC to 100 AD, not only among Jews and Christians, but also among Greeks, Romans, Persians and Egyptians, and Daniel is a representative apocalyptic seer, the recipient of divine revelation: he has learned the wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and surpassed them because his God is the true source of knowledge; he is one of the &quot;maskilim&quot; (משכלים), the wise ones, who have the task of teaching righteousness and whose number may be considered to include the authors of the book itself. The book is also an eschatology, as the divine revelation concerns the end of the present age, a predicted moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom. It gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God&#x27;s kingdom will be on this earth, that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and those Jews who have cooperated with them.

=== Meaning, symbolism, and chronology ===
The message of the Book of Daniel is that, just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, he would save all of Israel from their present oppression. The book is filled with monsters, angels, and numerology, drawn from a wide range of sources, both biblical and non-biblical, that would have had meaning in the context of 2nd-century Jewish culture and while Christian interpreters have always viewed these as predicting events in the New Testament—&quot;the Son of God&quot;, &quot;the Son of Man&quot;, Christ and the Antichrist—the book&#x27;s intended audience is the Jews of the 2nd century BC. The following explains a few of these predictions as modern biblical scholars understand them.

* The &quot;four kingdoms&quot; and the &quot;little horn&quot; (Daniel 2 and 7): The concept of four successive world empires stems from Greek theories of mythological history. Most modern interpreters agree that the four represent Babylon, the Medes, Persia and the Greeks, ending with Hellenistic Seleucid Syria and with Hellenistic Ptolemaic Egypt. The traditional interpretation of the dream identifies the four empires as the Babylonian (the head), Medo-Persian (arms and shoulders), Greek (thighs and legs), and Roman (the feet) empires. The symbolism of four metals in the statue in chapter 2 comes from Persian writings, while the four &quot;beasts from the sea&quot; in chapter 7 reflect Hosea 13:7–8, in which God threatens that he will be to Israel like a lion, a leopard, a bear or a wild beast. The consensus among scholars is that the four beasts of chapter 7 symbolise the same four world empires. The modern interpretation views Antiochus IV (reigned 175–164 BC) as the &quot;small horn&quot; that uproots three others (Antiochus usurped the rights of several other claimants to become king of the Seleucid Empire).
* The &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; and the &quot;one like a son of man&quot; (Daniel 7): The portrayal of God in Daniel 7:13 resembles the portrayal of the Canaanite god El as an ancient divine king presiding over the divine court. The &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; gives dominion over the earth to &quot;one like a son of man&quot;, and then in Daniel 7:27 to &quot;the people of the holy ones of the Most High&quot;, whom scholars consider the son of man to represent. These people can be understood as the &quot;maskilim&quot; (sages), or as the Jewish people broadly.
*&quot;The ram and he-goat&quot; (Daniel 8) as conventional astrological symbols represent Persia and Syria, as the text explains. The &quot;mighty horn&quot; stands for Alexander the Great (reigned 336–323 BC), and the &quot;four lesser horns&quot; represent the four principal generals (Diadochi) who fought over the Greek empire following Alexander&#x27;s death. The &quot;little horn&quot; again represents Antiochus IV. The key to the symbols lies in the description of the little horn&#x27;s actions: he ends the continual burnt offering and overthrows the Sanctuary, a clear reference to Antiochus&#x27; desecration of the Temple.
* The &quot;anointed ones&quot; and the &quot;seventy years&quot; (Chapter 9): Daniel reinterprets Jeremiah&#x27;s &quot;seventy years&quot; prophecy regarding the period Israel would spend in bondage to Babylon. From the point of view of the Maccabean era, Jeremiah&#x27;s promise was obviously not true—the Gentiles still oppressed the Jews, and the &quot;desolation of Jerusalem&quot; had not ended. Daniel, therefore, reinterprets the seventy years as seventy &quot;weeks&quot; of years, making up 490 years. The 70 weeks/490 years are subdivided, with seven &quot;weeks&quot; from the &quot;going forth of the word to rebuild and restore Jerusalem&quot; to the coming of an &quot;anointed one&quot;, while the final &quot;week&quot; is marked by the violent death of another &quot;anointed one&quot;, probably the High Priest Onias III (ousted to make way for Jason and murdered in 171 BC), and the profanation of the Temple. The point of this for Daniel is that the period of Gentile power is predetermined and is coming to an end.
* &quot;Kings of north and south&quot;: Chapters 10 to 12 concern the war between these kings, the events leading up to it, and its heavenly meaning. In chapter 10, the angel (Gabriel?) explains that there is currently a war in heaven between Michael, the angelic protector of Israel, and the &quot;princes&quot; (angels) of Persia and Greece; then, in chapter 11, he outlines the human wars which accompany this—the mythological concept sees standing behind every nation a god/angel who does battle on behalf of his people so that earthly events reflect what happens in heaven. The wars of the Ptolemies (&quot;kings of the south&quot;) against the Seleucids (&quot;kings of the north&quot;) are reviewed down to the career of Antiochus the Great (Antiochus III (reigned 222–187 BC), father of Antiochus IV), but the main focus is Antiochus IV, to whom more than half the chapter is devoted. The accuracy of these predictions lends credibility to the real prophecy with which the passage ends, the death of Antiochus—which, in the event, was not accurate.
* &quot;Predicting the end-time&quot; (Daniel 8:14 and 12:7–12): Biblical eschatology does not generally give precise information as to when the end will come, and Daniel&#x27;s attempts to specify the number of days remaining is a rare exception. Daniel asks the angel how long the &quot;little horn&quot; will be triumphant, and the angel replies that the Temple will be reconsecrated after 2,300 &quot;evenings and mornings&quot; have passed (Daniel 8:14). The angel is counting the two daily sacrifices, so the period is 1,150 days from the desecration in December 167. In chapter 12, the angel gives three more dates: the desolation will last &quot;for a time, times and half a time&quot;, or a year, two years, and a half a year (Daniel 12:8); then that the &quot;desolation&quot; will last for 1,290 days (12:11); and finally, 1,335 days (12:12). Verse 12:11 was presumably added after the lapse of the 1,150 days of chapter 8, and 12:12 after the lapse of the number in 12:11.

== Influence ==
The concepts of immortality and resurrection, with rewards for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, have roots much deeper than Daniel, but the first clear statement is found in the final chapter of that book: &quot;Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt.&quot; According to Daniel R. Schwartz, without the claim of the resurrection of Jesus, Christianity would have disappeared like the movements following other charismatic Jewish figures of the 1st century.

Daniel was quoted and referenced by both Jews and Christians in the 1st century AD as predicting the imminent end-time. Moments of national and cultural crisis continually reawakened the apocalyptic spirit, through the Montanists of the 2nd/3rd centuries, persecuted for their millennialism, to the more extreme elements of the 16th-century Reformation such as the Zwickau prophets and the Münster Rebellion. During the English Civil War, the Fifth Monarchy Men took their name and political program from Daniel 7, demanding that Oliver Cromwell allow them to form a &quot;government of saints&quot; in preparation for the coming of the Messiah; when Cromwell refused, they identified him instead as the Beast usurping the rightful place of King Jesus. For modern popularizers, the visions and revelations of Daniel remain a guide to the future, when the Antichrist will be destroyed by Jesus Christ at the Second Coming.

Daniel belongs not only to the religious tradition but also to the wider Western intellectual and artistic heritage. It was easily the most popular of the prophetic books for the Anglo-Saxons, who nevertheless treated it not as prophecy but as a historical book, &quot;a repository of dramatic stories about confrontations between God and a series of emperor-figures who represent the highest reach of man&quot;. Isaac Newton paid special attention to it, Francis Bacon borrowed a motto from it for his work &quot;Novum Organum&quot;, Baruch Spinoza drew on it, its apocalyptic second half attracted the attention of Carl Jung, and it inspired musicians from medieval liturgical drama to Darius Milhaud and artists including Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Eugène Delacroix.

<text>Batman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Batman was created by the artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book &quot;Detective Comics&quot; on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. His origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha, as a child, a vendetta tempered by the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth and James Gordon; love interest and occasional adversary Catwoman; as well as foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker, among others.

Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of Superman; although Kane frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more bat-like. They drew inspiration from pulp fiction characters like the Shadow and Sherlock Holmes. Batman received a spin-off publication, &quot;Batman&quot;, in 1940. Kane and Finger introduced Batman as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but he evolved into a just, tempered superhero with a stringent moral code that prohibits killing during the 1940s. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with Batman for years after it ended. Various creators worked to return Batman to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 miniseries &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; by Frank Miller.

DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo and Black Label; he has been considered DC&#x27;s flagship character since the 1990s. The longest-running Batman comic, &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters used the Batman persona, such as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the 1993–1994 &quot;&quot; story arc; Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; and Jace Fox, the son of Wayne&#x27;s ally Lucius, since 2021. DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the incarnation seen in &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and its successors, the incarnation from the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (2011) event, and numerous interpretations in comics published under the Elseworlds label.

Batman is one of the most iconic characters in popular culture and has been listed among the greatest comic book superheroes and characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed and featured in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as &quot;Lego Batman&quot; and video games such as the &quot;&quot; series. Batman has been adapted in many live-action and animated television series and films. Adam West portrayed him in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series, and he has been portrayed in film by Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale, Ben Affleck, and Robert Pattinson. Many actors, most prolifically Kevin Conroy, have provided Batman&#x27;s voice in animation and video games. In September 2024, Batman was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, being the first superhero to receive the honor.

== Publication history ==
===Creation and early history===

In early 1939, following the success of Superman, DC Comics&#x27; editors requested more superheroes. Bob Kane created Batman, initially drawing a character with red tights, bat wings, and a domino mask. Bill Finger, a collaborator, made significant contributions by suggesting a cowl, cape, gloves, and a darker costume. The character&#x27;s alter ego, Bruce Wayne, was inspired by historical figures Robert the Bruce and Mad Anthony Wayne. Batman&#x27;s early adventures drew inspiration from contemporary pulp fiction and characters like Zorro and the Shadow, establishing Batman as a master detective with a dark, brooding persona driven by the murder of his parents.

===Golden, Silver and Bronze Ages===

Batman debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 in 1939. Early stories were dark, featuring a Batman who did not shy away from killing. The character quickly became popular, leading to his own solo title in 1940. Robin, Batman&#x27;s sidekick, was introduced in 1940, lightening the tone and boosting sales. Over the next few years, Batman&#x27;s rogues&#x27; gallery expanded with iconic villains like the Joker and Catwoman.
The 1950s saw Batman in lighter, science fiction-influenced stories. However, declining sales led to a 1964 revamp by editor Julius Schwartz, who returned Batman to his detective roots and updated his appearance. The 1966 Batman TV series introduced a campy, humorous tone, which was reflected in the comics until its cancellation in 1968. In the 1970s, writers Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Neal Adams restored Batman&#x27;s dark, gritty nature, a trend that continued despite fluctuating sales.

=== Modern Age and reboots ===
In the Modern Age of Comic Books Batman comics have undergone significant transformations, reflecting changing storytelling trends and audience interests. Beginning with seminal works like &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; in the 1980s, which reintroduced Batman in a grittier, more mature context, the character&#x27;s narrative evolved to explore deeper themes and darker tones. This period also saw the exploration of Batman&#x27;s origins and psyche through works like &quot;,&quot;&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, which delved into the complexities of heroism and villainy. In the 1990s, storylines such as &quot;&quot; introduced new adversaries like Bane, who physically and mentally challenged Batman, leading to a temporary replacement by Jean-Paul Valley. The aftermath of an earthquake in &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; depicted Gotham City in chaos, further pushing Batman to new limits of heroism and survival. Entering the 21st century, Grant Morrison&#x27;s influential run introduced Damian Wayne as Batman&#x27;s son and heir, bringing familial dynamics and a new generation of challenges to the forefront. Morrison&#x27;s storytelling also delved into surreal and existential themes, such as in &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, which tested Batman&#x27;s resolve and sanity against cosmic threats and personal demons. The New 52 reboot in 2011 refreshed Batman&#x27;s continuity while preserving core elements of his character. This era introduced modern interpretations of classic storylines, like &quot;&quot;, where Batman confronts the Court of Owls, a clandestine society controlling Gotham for centuries. The chilling return of the Joker in &quot;Death of the Family&quot; explored the intricate relationships within Batman&#x27;s extended family of allies and adversaries. More recent developments under DC Rebirth and Infinite Frontier have continued to evolve Batman&#x27;s universe, exploring new characters like Gotham and Gotham Girl, and tackling contemporary issues within the context of Gotham City&#x27;s ever-evolving landscape of crime and heroism.

== Characterization ==

=== Bruce Wayne ===
Batman&#x27;s secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family&#x27;s fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate. He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip while feigning near-drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since Wayne is actually a strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time.

Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade. This is in contrast to the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Superman, whose Clark Kent persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the facade. In &quot;Batman Unmasked&quot;, a television documentary about the psychology of the character, behavioral scientist Benjamin Karney notes that Batman&#x27;s personality is driven by Bruce Wayne&#x27;s inherent humanity; that &quot;Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne&#x27;s efforts to make the world better&quot;. Bruce Wayne&#x27;s principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill. Bruce Wayne believes that our actions define us, we fail for a reason, and anything is possible.

Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison notes that both heroes &quot;believe in the same kind of things&quot; despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. Morrison notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: &quot;Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss.&quot; T. James Musler&#x27;s book &quot;Unleashing the Superhero in Us All&quot; explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne&#x27;s vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman.

Will Brooker notes in his book &quot;Batman Unmasked&quot; that &quot;the confirmation of the Batman&#x27;s identity lies with the young audience ...he doesn&#x27;t have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the morality, the humanity. There&#x27;s just a sense about him: &#x27;they trust him ...and they&#x27;re never wrong.&quot;

==== Personality ====
Batman&#x27;s primary character traits can be summarized as &quot;wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession&quot;. The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years with different creative teams. Dennis O&#x27;Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: &quot;Julie Schwartz did a Batman in &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective&quot; and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the &quot;Brave and the Bold&quot; and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days.&quot;

The driving force behind Bruce Wayne&#x27;s character is his parents&#x27; murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman&#x27;s background and decided that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes&quot;. Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist and to train his body into physical perfection to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne&#x27;s insight into the criminal mind. He also speaks over 40 languages.

Another of Batman&#x27;s characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman&#x27;s origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the &quot;reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions&quot;. The origin is the source of the character&#x27;s traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character&#x27;s adventures.

Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as &quot;a dionysian figure, a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order&quot;. Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting, a fear that originates from the criminals&#x27; own guilty conscience. Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into Batman&#x27;s characterization, such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and increasingly alienated behavior. Batman, shortly a year after his debut and the introduction of Robin, was changed in 1940 after DC editor Whitney Ellsworth felt the character would be tainted by his lethal methods and DC established their own ethical code, subsequently he was retconned to have a stringent moral code, which has stayed with the character of Batman ever since. Miller&#x27;s Batman was closer to the original pre-Robin version, who was willing to kill criminals if necessary.

On several occasions former Robin Dick Grayson has served as Batman; most notably in 2009 while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010. As part of DC&#x27;s 2011 continuity relaunch, Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; crossover event.

In an interview with IGN, Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin represented a &quot;reverse&quot; of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, &quot;a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin&quot;. Morrison explained their intentions for the new characterization of Batman: &quot;Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman&#x27;s partner since he was a kid, he&#x27;s led the Teen Titans, and he&#x27;s trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he&#x27;s a very different kind of Batman. He&#x27;s a lot easier; a lot looser and more relaxed.&quot;

Over the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence. Jean-Paul Valley, also known as Azrael, assumed the cowl after the events of the &quot;&quot; saga. Jim Gordon donned a mecha-suit after the events of &quot;&quot;, and served as Batman in 2015 and 2016. In 2021, as part of the &quot;Fear State&quot; crossover event, Lucius Fox&#x27;s son Jace Fox succeeds Bruce as Batman in a 2021 storyline, depicted in the series &quot;I Am Batman&quot;, after Batman was declared dead.

Additionally, members of the group Batman Incorporated, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world. Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various former proteges of Bruce Wayne.

== Supporting characters ==
Batman&#x27;s interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters.

=== Enemies ===

Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman&#x27;s character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime. These foes are commonly referred to as Batman&#x27;s &quot;rogues gallery&quot;. Batman&#x27;s &quot;most implacable foe&quot; is the Joker, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a &quot;personification of the irrational&quot;, the Joker represents &quot;everything Batman [opposes]&quot;. Other long-time recurring foes that are part of Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery include Catwoman (a cat burglar anti-heroine who is variously an ally and romantic interest), the Penguin, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, Two-Face (Harvey Dent), the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane, Clayface, and Killer Croc, among others. Many of Batman&#x27;s adversaries are often psychiatric patients at Arkham Asylum.

=== Allies ===
Alfred Pennyworth, Batman&#x27;s loyal butler and father figure, first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #16 (1943). After Bruce Wayne&#x27;s parents were killed, Alfred raised Bruce and became one of the few people to know his secret identity. He is often portrayed as a steadying presence in Bruce&#x27;s life, offering both emotional support and practical assistance in Batman&#x27;s crime-fighting endeavors. More than just a caretaker, Alfred is a trusted ally and sometimes sidekick, sharing Wayne Manor with Bruce and contributing to Batman&#x27;s mission.

One of Batman&#x27;s most crucial allies is Commissioner James Gordon. Their relationship is built on mutual respect and a shared commitment to justice in Gotham City. In &quot;&quot;, Gordon and Batman learn to trust each other, which transforms their efforts against crime into a more effective partnership. Gordon&#x27;s perspective as a police officer complements Batman&#x27;s vigilantism, allowing them to tackle Gotham&#x27;s challenges together. Another important ally is the Justice League, which further emphasizes the importance of collaboration. Batman&#x27;s relationship with Superman showcases how their contrasting ideologies can complement each other. In stories like &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot;, their friendship highlights how Batman&#x27;s methods benefit from Superman&#x27;s optimism and strength.

===Sidekicks===
Robin, Batman&#x27;s vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years; each iteration of the Robin character, of which there have been five in the mainstream continuity, function as members of the Batman family, but additionally, as Batman&#x27;s &quot;central&quot; sidekick in various media. Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because &quot;Batman didn&#x27;t have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking.&quot; The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940. In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero Nightwing. A second Robin, Jason Todd was introduced in the 1980s, following Dick Grayson&#x27;s departure from the role. Initially impulsive and rebellious, Jason&#x27;s tenure as Robin was controversial among fans. In 1988, DC held a fan vote to determine his fate in the iconic &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; storyline, where the Joker brutally beat Jason with a crowbar and left him to die in an explosion. The fans voted for his death. However, Jason was later resurrected and returned as the antihero Red Hood.

The third Robin in the mainstream comics is Tim Drake, who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series, and goes by the name Red Robin, a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the first decade of the new millennium, Stephanie Brown served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made vigilante identity the Spoiler, and later as Batgirl. After Brown&#x27;s apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to Damian Wayne, the 10-year-old son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, in the late 2000s. Damian&#x27;s tenure as &quot;du jour&quot; Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot; in 2013. Batman&#x27;s next young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise young woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the ornithological theme nonetheless; she debuted the codename and identity of the Bluebird in 2014. Unlike the Robins, the Bluebird is willing and permitted to use a gun, albeit non-lethal; her weapon of choice is a modified rifle that fires taser rounds. In 2015, a new series began titled &quot;We Are...Robin,&quot; focused on a group of teenagers using the Robin persona to fight crime in Gotham City. The most prominent of these, Duke Thomas, later becomes Batman&#x27;s crimefighting partner as The Signal.

=== Romantic interests ===
Batman&#x27;s romantic history spans decades, filled with relationships that reflect his struggle between personal happiness and his duty as Gotham&#x27;s protector. His first love interest was Julie Madison, introduced in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #31 (1939). Though engaged to Bruce Wayne, she left due to his distant and playboy persona, highlighting the conflict between Bruce&#x27;s dual life and his desire for a normal relationship.

Selina Kyle, also known as Catwoman, is perhaps the most notable figure in Batman&#x27;s romantic history. Debuting in &quot;Batman&quot; #1 (1940), their relationship is characterized by a blend of romance and rivalry. Over the years, they have shared intense connections, often navigating the fine line between love and conflict. Their relationship culminated in an engagement during the DC Rebirth&quot;.&quot;

Another important figure is Vicki Vale, a journalist introduced in &quot;Batman&quot; #49 (1948). Vicki&#x27;s attempts to uncover Batman&#x27;s true identity lead to a complicated romantic involvement that waxed and waned over the years, especially during the early 1980s when their relationship became more serious.

Talia al Ghul, introduced in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #411 (1971), is another key player in Batman&#x27;s love life. Their relationship is fraught with conflict due to her father, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, and his criminal ambitions. Despite the challenges, their love story resulted in the birth of Damian Wayne, who would grow to become the latest Robin and add a new layer of complexity to Batman&#x27;s character.

Additionally, Batman&#x27;s relationship with Wonder Woman has been explored in various storylines, including a passionate kiss in &quot;JLA&quot; (2003) during a moment of crisis. However, their relationship remains largely unexplored, often overshadowed by their respective commitments.

One of the most controversial romantic pairings emerged from the animated adaptation of &quot;&quot; (2016), which depicted a brief romantic involvement between Batman and Batgirl (Barbara Gordon). This portrayal sparked significant criticism among fans, reflecting the challenges and complexities of Batman&#x27;s romantic entanglements over the years.

== Abilities ==

=== Skills and training ===
Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on &quot;his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess&quot;. Batman&#x27;s inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient scientist, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world&#x27;s greatest detectives, if not the world&#x27;s greatest crime solver. Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical and mental conditioning. As a polymath, his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe. He has shown prowess in assorted fields such as mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, and several levels of engineering. He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman. In the &quot;&quot; story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet.

Batman has trained extensively in various fighting styles, making him one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the DC Universe. He possesses a photographic memory, and has fully utilized his photographic memory to master a total of 127 forms of martial arts. In terms of his physical condition, Batman is described as peak human and far beyond an Olympic-athlete-level condition, able to perform feats such as easily running across rooftops in a Parkour-esque fashion, pressing thousands of pounds regularly, and even bench pressing six hundred pounds of soil and coffin in a poisoned and starved state. Superman describes Batman as &quot;the most dangerous man on Earth&quot;, able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison&#x27;s first storyline in &quot;JLA&quot;.

Batman is strongly disciplined, and he has the ability to function under great physical pain and resist most forms of telepathy and mind control. He is a master of disguise, multilingual, and an expert in espionage, often gathering information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone. Batman is highly skilled in stealth movement and escapology, which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable deathtraps with little to no harm. He is also a master strategist, considered DC&#x27;s greatest tactician, with numerous plans in preparation for almost any eventuality.

Batman is an expert in interrogation techniques and his intimidating and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman&#x27;s most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of Superman and Wonder Woman.

Among physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the Batplane), as well as being able to operate other types of machinery. In some publications, he even underwent some magician training.

=== Technology ===
Batman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept of Batman&#x27;s arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the batarang and the &quot;Batgyro&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #31 and 32 (Sept. and October 1939).

;Personal armor

Batman&#x27;s batsuit aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts, and incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.

The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists&#x27; interpretations, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a pair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops. The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl&#x27;s ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O&#x27;Neil said, &quot;We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don&#x27;t have to look the same ...Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it.&quot;

Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue. Hence, the costume&#x27;s colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey; as well as black and grey. In the Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; films, Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot; depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle. Ben Affleck&#x27;s Batman in the DC Extended Universe films wears a suit grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol. Seemingly following the suit of the DC Extended Universe outfit, Robert Pattinson&#x27;s uniform in &quot;The Batman&quot; restores the more traditional gray bodysuit and black appendage design, notably different from prior iterations by mostly utilizing real world armor and apparel pieces from modern military and motorcycle gear.

;Batmobile
Batman&#x27;s primary vehicle is the Batmobile, which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with tailfins that suggest a bat&#x27;s wings.

Batman also has an aircraft called the Batplane (originally a relatively traditionally, but bat-motifed plane, later seen as the much more unique &quot;Batwing&quot; starting in the 1989 film), along with various other means of transportation.

In proper practice, the &quot;bat&quot; prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; live-action television show and the &quot;Super Friends&quot; animated series) stretched the practice to campy proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a Batboat, Bat-Sub, and Batcycle, among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such &quot;bat-&quot; names as the Bat-computer, Bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-shark repellent bat-spray, and Bat-rope. The storyline &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; suggests that given Batman&#x27;s grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the &quot;bat&quot; prefix on his own. In &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name &quot;Batmobile&quot; when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman&#x27;s vehicle.

The Batmobile, which was before frequently depicted to resemble a sports car, was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books, with the Batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics.

;Utility belt

Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his utility belt. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it.

Since the 1989 film, Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable (before this, a he employed a traditionally thrown grappling hook.) This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City.

An exception to the range of Batman&#x27;s equipment are hand guns, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents&#x27; murder. In modern stories in terms of his vehicles, Batman compromises on that principle to install weapon systems on them for the purpose of non-lethally disabling other vehicles, forcing entry into locations and attacking dangerous targets too large to defeat by other means.

;Bat-Signal

When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a searchlight with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.

In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent top. The line connects directly to Batman&#x27;s residence, Wayne Manor, specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne&#x27;s study and the extension phone in the Batcave.

;Batcave

The Batcave is Batman&#x27;s secret headquarters, consisting of a series of caves beneath his mansion, Wayne Manor. As his command center, the Batcave serves multiple purposes; supercomputer, surveillance, redundant power-generators, forensics lab, medical infirmary, private study, training dojo, fabrication workshop, arsenal, hangar and garage. It houses the vehicles and equipment Batman uses in his campaign to fight crime. It is also a trophy room and storage facility for Batman&#x27;s unique memorabilia collected over the years from various cases he has worked on.

In both the comic book &quot;&quot; #45 and the 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, the cave is said to have been part of the Underground Railroad.

== Fictional character biography ==
Batman&#x27;s history has undergone many retroactive continuity revisions, both minor and major. Elements of the character&#x27;s history have varied greatly. Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, &quot;Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades.&quot;

=== 20th century ===

==== Origin ====
The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character&#x27;s origin story. As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, murdered with a gun by a mugger named Joe Chill. Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents. This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in Gotham City as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, &quot;Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number&quot;, a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O&#x27;Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.

==== Golden Age ====

In Batman&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter. Batman&#x27;s origin is first presented in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in &quot;Batman&quot; #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites. Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of 8, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. &quot;Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot&quot;, Wayne remarks, &quot;so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ...&quot; As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.

In early strips, Batman&#x27;s career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne has a fiancé named Julie Madison. In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #38, Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his vigilante partner, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member, and thus only participates occasionally. Batman&#x27;s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City&#x27;s police department. During this time, Alfred Pennyworth arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo&#x27;s secret identities, joins their service as their butler.

==== Silver Age ====
The Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced Barry Allen as a new, updated version of the Flash. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth-One. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.

After the introduction of DC Comics&#x27; Multiverse in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman (Selina Kyle). The two have a daughter, Helena Wayne, who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the position as Gotham&#x27;s protector along with Dick Grayson, the Earth-Two Robin, once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner. Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles, however, often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike the Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman&#x27;s history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in &quot;Batman&quot; #208 (February 1969)) after his parents&#x27; death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980, then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the &quot;Untold Legend of the Batman&quot; miniseries to thoroughly chronicle Batman&#x27;s origin and history.

Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series&#x27; cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the Justice League of America, Batman appears in its first story, in 1960&#x27;s &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.

==== Bronze Age ====
In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics&#x27; effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City&#x27;s crime. In 1974&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Stalker&quot; storyline, a diploma on the wall reveals Bruce Wayne as a graduate of Yale Law School. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin or Batgirl. Batman&#x27;s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath, and the arrival of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman&#x27;s secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing.

In the final issue of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders. He serves as the team&#x27;s leader until &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.

==== Modern Age ====
After the 12-issue miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman&#x27;s origin in the storyline &quot;&quot; from &quot;Batman&quot; #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman&#x27;s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham&#x27;s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman&#x27;s existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following &quot;Crisis&quot;, DC launched a new Batman title called &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot; in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the &quot;Year One&quot; period.

Subsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crimefighting, a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade&#x27;s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin.

Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been intertitle crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published &quot;&quot;. During the storyline&#x27;s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of &quot;Knightfall&quot;, the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman&#x27;s adventures, and Bruce Wayne&#x27;s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in &quot;KnightsEnd&quot;, as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.

The 1994 company-wide crossover storyline &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now consider Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.

Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison&#x27;s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled &quot;JLA&quot;. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade&#x27;s closing crossover arc. In 1998&#x27;s &quot;&quot; storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;.

Meanwhile, Batman&#x27;s relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of &quot;Batman: Officer Down&quot; and &quot;Batman: War Games/War Crimes&quot;; Batman&#x27;s long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Bullock are forced out of the police department in &quot;Officer Down&quot;, while &quot;War Games&quot; and &quot;War Crimes&quot; saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City&#x27;s criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the sadistic Black Mask the undisputed ruler of the city&#x27;s criminal gangs. Lex Luthor arranges for the murder of Batman&#x27;s on-again, off-again love interest Vesper Lynd (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the &quot;Bruce Wayne: Murderer?&quot; and &quot;Bruce Wayne: Fugitive&quot; story arcs. Though Batman is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the organization known as &quot;Checkmate&quot; while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state&#x27;s evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with help from Talia al Ghul in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #1–6.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2000s ====
DC Comics&#x27; 2005 miniseries &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman&#x27;s memories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from lobotomizing Dr. Light after he raped Sue Dibny. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over and, if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered. The revelation of Batman&#x27;s creation and his tacit responsibility for the Blue Beetle&#x27;s death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother EYE and the OMACs, though, at the very end, Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.

Following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to &quot;rebuild Batman&quot;. In the &quot;&quot; storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. Part of this absence is captured during Week 30 of the &quot;52&quot; series, which shows Batman fighting his inner demons. Later on in &quot;52&quot;, Batman is shown undergoing an intense meditation ritual in Nanda Parbat. This becomes an important part of the regular &quot;Batman&quot; title, which reveals that Batman is reborn as a more effective crime fighter while undergoing this ritual, having &quot;hunted down and ate&quot; the last traces of fear in his mind. At the end of the &quot;Face the Face&quot; story arc, Bruce officially adopts Tim (who had lost both of his parents at various points in the character&#x27;s history) as his son. The follow-up story arc in &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Batman and Son&quot;, introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman&#x27;s son with Talia al Ghul. Although originally, in &quot;&quot;, Bruce&#x27;s coupling with Talia was implied to be consensual, this arc retconned it into Talia forcing herself on Bruce.

Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new &quot;Justice League of America&quot; series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders.

Grant Morrison&#x27;s 2008 storyline, &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; featured Batman being physically and mentally broken by the enigmatic villain Doctor Hurt and attracted news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion, which would speculated to feature the death of Bruce Wayne. However, though Batman is shown to possibly perish at the end of the arc, the two-issue arc &quot;Last Rites&quot;, which leads into the crossover storyline &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, shows that Batman survives his helicopter crash into the Gotham City River and returns to the Batcave, only to be summoned to the Hall of Justice by the JLA to help investigate the New God Orion&#x27;s death. The story ends with Batman retrieving the god-killing bullet used to kill Orion, setting up its use in &quot;Final Crisis&quot;. In the pages of &quot;Final Crisis&quot; Batman is reduced to a charred skeleton. In &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #7, Wayne is shown witnessing the passing of the first man, Anthro. Wayne&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; sets up the three-issue &quot;&quot; miniseries in which Wayne&#x27;s ex-proteges compete for the &quot;right&quot; to assume the role of Batman, which concludes with Grayson becoming Batman, while Tim Drake takes on the identity of the Red Robin. Dick and Damian continue as Batman and Robin, and in the crossover storyline &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, what appears to be Bruce&#x27;s corpse is reanimated as a Black Lantern zombie, but is later shown that Bruce&#x27;s corpse is one of Darkseid&#x27;s failed Batman clones. Dick and Batman&#x27;s other friends conclude that Bruce is alive.

==== 2010s ====
Bruce subsequently returned in Morrison&#x27;s miniseries &quot;&quot;, which depicted his travels through time from prehistory to present-day Gotham. Bruce&#x27;s return set up &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot;, an ongoing series which focused on Wayne franchising the Batman identity across the globe, allowing Dick and Damian to continue as Gotham&#x27;s Dynamic Duo. Bruce publicly announced that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as &quot;Batman, Incorporated&quot;. However, due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC Comics&#x27; 2011 relaunch of all of its comic books, &quot;The New 52&quot;, Dick Grayson was restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again. The relaunch also interrupted the publication of &quot;Batman, Incorporated&quot;, which resumed its story in 2012–2013 with changes to suit the new status quo.

=== The New 52 ===
During &quot;The New 52&quot;, all of DC&#x27;s continuity was reset and the timeline was changed, making Batman the first superhero to emerge. This emergence took place during &quot;Zero Year&quot;, where Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham and becomes Batman, fighting the original Red Hood and the Riddler. In the present day, Batman discovers the Court of Owls, a secret organization operating in Gotham for decades. Batman somewhat defeats the Court by defeating Owlman, although the Court continues to operate on a smaller scale. The Joker returns after losing the skin on his face (as shown in the opening issue of the second volume of &quot;Detective Comics&quot;) and attempts to kill the Batman&#x27;s allies, though he is stopped by Batman. After some time, Joker returns again, and both he and Batman die while fighting each other. Jim Gordon temporarily becomes Batman, using a high-tech suit, while it is revealed that an amnesiac Bruce Wayne is still alive. Gordon attempts to fight a new villain called Mr. Bloom, while Wayne, regains his memories with the help of Alfred Pennyworth and Julie Madison. Once with his memories, Wayne becomes Batman again and defeats Mr. Bloom with the help of Gordon.

=== DC Rebirth ===

The timeline was reset again during &quot;Rebirth&quot;, although no significant changes were made to the Batman mythos. Batman meets two new superheroes operating in Gotham named Gotham and Gotham Girl. Psycho-Pirate gets into Gotham&#x27;s head and turns against Batman, and is finally defeated when he is killed. This event is very traumatic for Gotham Girl and she begins to lose her sanity.

Batman forms his own Suicide Squad, including Catwoman, and attempts to take down Bane. The mission is successful, and Batman breaks Bane&#x27;s back. Batman proposes to Catwoman.

After healing from his wounds, an angry Bane travels to Gotham, where he fights Batman and loses. Batman then tells Catwoman about the War of Jokes and Riddles, and she agrees to marry him. Bane takes control of Arkham Asylum and manipulates Catwoman into leaving Wayne before the wedding. This causes Wayne to become very angry, and, as Batman, lashes out against criminals, nearly killing Mr. Freeze.

Batman learns of Bane&#x27;s control over Arkham and teams up with the Penguin to stop him. Bane captures Batman, and Scarecrow causes him to hallucinate, although he eventually breaks free. Batman escapes and reunites with Catwoman, while Bane captures and kills Alfred Pennyworth. Batman returns and defeats Bane, although too late to save Alfred. Gotham Girl prompts him to marry Catwoman.

It is revealed that the Joker who was working for Bane was really Clayface in disguise. The real Joker has been plotting a master plan to take over Gotham. This plan comes to fruition during &quot;The Joker War&quot;, in which Joker takes over the city. Batman defeats the Joker who vanishes after an explosion. Ghost-Maker, an enemy from Batman&#x27;s past, appears in Gotham, and, after a battle, becomes a sort of ally to Batman. A new group called the Magistrate rises up in Gotham, led by Simon Saint, whose goal is to outlaw vigilantes such as Batman. At the same time, Scarecrow returns, fighting Batman. During &quot;Fear State&quot;, Batman battles and defeats both Scarecrow and the Magistrate&#x27;s Peacekeepers.

== Other versions ==

The character of Batman has been portrayed in numerous alternative versions across various media since his debut in 1939. These adaptations explore different facets and interpretations of the character.

In the &quot;Smallville&quot; a television series, Bruce Wayne adopts the Batman persona in 2001, later teaming up with Superman and other superheroes. Frank Miller&#x27;s influential series, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, reimagines Batman as an older, more hardened vigilante, coming out of retirement to fight crime in a dystopian future.

In the &quot;&quot; universe, Batman leads a resistance against a tyrannical Superman who has taken control of Earth.

The &quot;DC Bombshells&quot; series sets Batman in a World War II-era context, with Bruce Wayne taking inspiration from Batwoman to become the masked hero. The &quot;Dark Multiverse&quot; introduces various twisted versions of Batman, such as the Batman Who Laughs, a hybrid of Batman and the Joker, and Red Death, a fusion of Batman and the Flash.

Other notable reimaginings include &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;, where Batman appears in a crossover with Marvel&#x27;s Avengers; Stan Lee&#x27;s &quot;Just Imagine&quot;, which offers a completely different origin for Batman; and &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, where an older Batman operates in a dystopian future alongside other aged superheroes.

In &quot;Superman: American Alien&quot;, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s journey is retold with significant differences, and &quot;Batman: White Knight&quot; explores a reality where the Joker is cured of his insanity and seeks to expose Batman as the true villain of Gotham. These various adaptations and reinterpretations highlight the versatility and enduring appeal of Batman as a character, allowing for a rich exploration of his mythology across different narratives and settings.

== In popular culture ==

Batman has ascended to the status of a global pop culture phenomenon, transcending his origins in comic books. His influence expanded notably with the release of the 1989 film, which propelled him to the forefront of public consciousness through widespread merchandising. &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes Batman as emblematic of the constant reinvention characteristic of modern mass culture, embodying both iconic status and commercial appeal, making him a quintessential cultural artifact of the 21st century.

===Media appearances===
Apart from comics, Batman&#x27;s presence spans various mediums, including newspapers, radio dramas, television, stage, and film. From the 1940s serials to contemporary TV shows like &quot;Gotham&quot; and &quot;Titans&quot;, Batman&#x27;s legacy endures. Celebrating the character&#x27;s 75th anniversary, Warner Bros released &quot;Batman: Strange Days&quot;, showcasing his timeless appeal.

In September 2024, Batman become the first superhero to be given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was the 2,790th star.

=== Different interpretations ===

Gay interpretations of Batman have been studied academically since psychologist Fredric Wertham&#x27;s claims in 1954. Andy Medhurst and Will Brooker have explored Batman&#x27;s appeal to gay audiences and the validity of a queer reading. Meanwhile, in psychological interpretations, Dr. Travis Langley sees Batman as representing the &quot;shadow archetype&quot;, confronting inner darkness to fight evil, according to Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell&#x27;s theories. Langley&#x27;s analysis adds depth to Batman&#x27;s psychological complexity.

<text>The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston. The Red Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East Division. Founded in as one of the American League&#x27;s eight charter franchises, the team&#x27;s home ballpark has been Fenway Park since . The &quot;Red Sox&quot; name was chosen by the team owner, John I. Taylor, , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the &quot;Boston Red Stockings&quot;, including the Boston Braves (now the Atlanta Braves). The team has won nine World Series championships, tied for the third-most of any MLB team, and has played in thirteen World Series. Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in . In addition, they won the American League pennant, but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series.

The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918. However, they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history, dubbed the &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot; after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox&#x27; sale of star player Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their World Series championship in 1918. The Sox endured an 86-year wait before the team&#x27;s sixth World Series championship in . The team&#x27;s history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including Enos Slaughter&#x27;s &quot;mad dash&quot; in , the &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; of , Carlton Fisk&#x27;s home run in , and Bill Buckner&#x27;s error in . Following their victory in the 2018 World Series, they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century, with championships in , , and . The team&#x27;s history has also been marked by its intense rivalry with the New York Yankees, arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports.

The Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports Group, which also owns Liverpool of the Premier League in England, the National Hockey League&#x27;s Pittsburgh Penguins and partially owns RFK Racing of the NASCAR Cup Series. They are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance, while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance. From May 15, 2003, to April 10, 2013, the Red Sox sold out every home game—a total of 820 games (794 regular season) for a major professional sports record. Both Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; and the Standells&#x27; &quot;Dirty Water&quot; have become anthems for the Red Sox.

As of the end of the 2024 season, the franchise&#x27;s all-time regular-season record is ().

==Nickname==
The name &quot;Red Sox&quot;, chosen by owner John I. Taylor after the 1907 season, refers to the red hose in the team uniform beginning in 1908. &quot;Sox&quot; had been previously adopted for the Chicago White Sox by newspapers needing a headline-friendly form of &quot;Stockings&quot;, as &quot;Stockings Win!&quot; in large type did not fit in a column. The team name &quot;Red Sox&quot; had previously been used as early as 1888 by a &#x27;colored&#x27; team from Norfolk, Virginia. The Spanish language media sometimes refers to the team as , a translation of &quot;red socks&quot;. The official Spanish site uses the variant &quot;Los Red Sox&quot;.

The Red Stockings nickname was previously used by the Cincinnati Red Stockings, who were members of the pioneering National Association of Base Ball Players. Managed by Harry Wright, Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings and earned the famous nickname, a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869. When the club folded after the 1870 season, Wright was hired by Boston businessman Ivers Whitney Adams to organize a new team in Boston, and he brought three teammates and the &quot;Red Stockings&quot; nickname along. (Most nicknames were then unofficial—neither club names nor registered trademarks—so the migration was informal.) The Boston Red Stockings won four championships in the five seasons of the new National Association, the first professional league.

When a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the National League in 1876, the &quot;Red Stockings&quot; nickname was commonly reserved for them once again, and the Boston team was referred to as the &quot;Red Caps&quot;. Other names were sometimes used before Boston officially adopted the nickname &quot;Braves&quot; in 1912; the club eventually left Boston for Milwaukee and is now playing in Atlanta.

In 1901, the upstart American League established a competing club in Boston. (Originally, a team was supposed to be started in Buffalo, but league ownership at the last minute removed that city from their plans in favor of the expansion Boston franchise.) For seven seasons, the AL team wore &quot;dark blue&quot; stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply &quot;Boston&quot;, &quot;Bostonians&quot; or &quot;the Bostons&quot;; or the &quot;Americans&quot; or &quot;Boston Americans&quot; as in &quot;American Leaguers&quot;, Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901–1907 jerseys, both home, and road, just read &quot;Boston&quot;, except for 1902 when they sported large letters &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; denoting &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;American&quot;. Newspaper writers of the time used other nicknames for the club, including &quot;Somersets&quot; (for owner Charles Somers), &quot;Plymouth Rocks&quot;, &quot;Beaneaters&quot;, the &quot;Collinsites&quot; (for manager Jimmy Collins)&quot;, and &quot;Pilgrims&quot;.

For years many sources have listed &quot;Pilgrims&quot; as the early Boston AL team&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; nickname, but researcher Bill Nowlin has demonstrated that the name was barely used, if at all, during the team&#x27;s early years. The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled &quot;The Pilgrims At Home&quot; written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener (&quot;Rory O&#x27;More&quot; melody). This nickname was commonly used during that season, perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players. John I. Taylor had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims &quot;sounded too much like homeless wanderers.&quot;

The National League club in Boston, though seldom called the &quot;Red Stockings&quot; anymore, still wore red trim. In 1907, the National League club adopted an all-white uniform, and the American League team saw an opportunity. On December 18, 1907, Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The 1908 uniforms featured a large icon of a red stocking angling across the shirt front. For 1908, the National League club returned to wearing red trim, but the American League team finally had an official nickname and remained the &quot;Red Sox&quot; for good.

The name is often shortened to &quot;Bosox&quot; or &quot;BoSox&quot;, a combination of &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Sox&quot; (similar to the &quot;ChiSox&quot; in Chicago or the minor league &quot;WooSox&quot; of Worcester, a minor league affiliate of Boston). Sportswriters sometimes refer to the Red Sox as the &quot;Crimson Hose&quot; and &quot;the Olde Towne Team&quot;. Recently, media have begun to call them the &quot;Sawx&quot; casually, reflecting how the word is pronounced with a New England accent. However, most fans simply refer to the team as the &quot;Sox&quot; when the context is understood to mean Red Sox.

The formal name of the entity which owns the team is &quot;Boston Red Sox Baseball Club Limited Partnership&quot;. The name shown on a door near the main entrance to Fenway Park, &quot;Boston American League Baseball Company&quot;, was used prior to the team&#x27;s reorganization as a limited partnership on May 26, 1978.

==History==
===1901–1919: The Golden Era===

In 1901, the minor Western League, led by Ban Johnson, declared itself to be equal to the National League, then the only major league in baseball. Johnson had changed the name of the league to the American League prior to the 1900 season. In 1901, the league created a franchise in Boston, called the &quot;Boston Americans&quot;, to compete with the National League team there.
Playing their home games at Huntington Avenue Grounds, the Boston franchise finished second in the league in 1901 and third in 1902. The team was originally owned by C.W. Somers. In January 1902, he sold all but one share of the team to Henry Killilea.

The early teams were led by manager and star third baseman Jimmy Collins, outfielders Chick Stahl, Buck Freeman, and Patsy Dougherty, and pitcher Cy Young, who in 1901 won the pitching Triple Crown with 33 wins (41.8% of the team&#x27;s 79 wins), 1.62 ERA and 158 strikeouts.

In 1903, the team won their first American League pennant and, as a result, Boston participated in the first modern World Series, going up against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Aided by the modified chants of &quot;Tessie&quot; by the Royal Rooters fan club and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans won the best-of-nine series five games to three.

In April 1904, the team was purchased by John I. Taylor of Boston. The 1904 team found itself in a pennant race against the New York Highlanders. A predecessor to what became a storied rivalry, this race featured the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Unglaub. In order to win the pennant, the Highlanders needed to win both games of their final doubleheader with the Americans at the Highlanders&#x27; home stadium, Hilltop Park. With Jack Chesbro on the mound, and the score tied 2–2 with a man on third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and Lou Criger scored the go-ahead run and the Americans won their second pennant. However, the NL champion New York Giants declined to play any postseason series, but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in 1905.

In 1906, Boston lost 105 games and finished last in the league. In December 1907, Taylor proposed that the Boston Americans name change to the Boston Red Sox.

By 1909, center fielder Tris Speaker had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team finished the season in third place. In 1912, the Red Sox won 105 games and the pennant. The 105 wins stood as the club record until the 2018 club won 108. Anchored by an outfield including Tris Speaker, Harry Hooper and Duffy Lewis, and pitcher Smoky Joe Wood, the Red Sox beat the New York Giants 4–3–1 in the 1912 World Series best known for Snodgrass&#x27;s Muff.

From 1913 to 1916, the Red Sox were owned by Joseph Lannin. In 1914, Lannin signed a young up-and-coming pitcher named Babe Ruth from the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. In 1915, the team won 101 games and went on to the 1915 World Series, where they beat the Philadelphia Phillies four games to one. Following the 1915 season, Tris Speaker was traded to the Cleveland Indians. The Red Sox went on to win the 1916 World Series, defeating the Brooklyn Robins.

Harry Frazee bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in 1916 for about $675,000. In 1918, Babe Ruth led the team to another World Series championship over the Chicago Cubs.

===Sale of Babe Ruth and Aftermath (1920–1938)===
Prior to the sale of Babe Ruth, multiple trades occurred between the Red Sox and the Yankees. On December 18, 1918, outfielder Duffy Lewis, pitcher Dutch Leonard and pitcher Ernie Shore were traded to the Yankees for pitcher Ray Caldwell, Slim Love, Roxy Walters, Frank Gilhooley and $15,000. In July 1919, pitcher Carl Mays quit the team and then was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000.

After Mays was traded, league president Ban Johnson suspended him due to his breaking of his contract with the Red Sox. The Yankees went to court after Johnson suspended Mays. After the Yankees were able to play Mays, the American League split into two factions: the Yankees, Red Sox and White Sox, known as the &quot;Insurrectos&quot;, versus Johnson and the remaining five clubs, a.k.a. the &quot;Loyal Five&quot;.
On December 26, 1919, the team sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees. The sale was announced on January 6, 1920. In 1919, Ruth had broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 home runs. It was believed that Frazee sold Ruth to finance the Broadway musical &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;. While No, No, Nanette did not open on Broadway until 1925, Leigh Montville&#x27;s book, &quot;The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth&quot;, reports that &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; had originated as a non-musical stage play called &quot;My Lady Friends&quot;, which opened on Broadway in December 1919. According to the book, &quot;My Lady Friends&quot; had been financed by Ruth&#x27;s sale to the Yankees. The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry, considered the &quot;best rivalry&quot; by American sports journalists.

In the December 1920, Wally Schang, Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for Del Pratt, Muddy Ruel, Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick. The following winter, shortstop Everett Scott, and pitchers Bullet Joe Bush and Sad Sam Jones were traded to the Yankees for Roger Peckinpaugh, who was immediately traded to the Washington Senators, Jack Quinn, Rip Collins, Bill Piercy.

On July 23, 1922, Joe Dugan and Elmer Smith were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, Johnny Mitchell, and Lefty O&#x27;Doul. Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the St. Louis Browns in a tight pennant race. After late trades in 1922, a June 15 trading deadline went into effect. In 1923, Herb Pennock was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees for Camp Skinner, Norm McMillan, and George Murray.

The loss of several top players sent the Red Sox into free fall. During the 1920s and early 1930s, the Red Sox were fixtures in the second division, never finishing closer than 20 games out of first. The losses increased after Frazee sold the team to Bob Quinn in 1923. The team bottomed out in 1932 with a record of 43–111, still the worst record in franchise history. However, in 1931, Earl Webb set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season with 67.

In 1933, Tom Yawkey bought the team. Yawkey acquired pitchers Wes Ferrell and Lefty Grove, Joe Cronin, a shortstop and manager, and first baseman Jimmie Foxx. In 1938, Foxx hit 50 home runs, which stood as a club record for 68 years. That year Foxx also set a club-record of 175 runs.

===1939–1960: The Ted Williams Era===

In 1939, the Red Sox purchased the contract of outfielder Ted Williams from the minor league San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the &quot;Ted Sox&quot;. Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time. The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams&#x27; left-handed swing, and are sometimes called &quot;Williamsburg&quot;. Before this addition, it was over to right field. He served two stints in the United States Marine Corps as a pilot and saw active duty in both World War II and the Korean War, missing at least five full seasons of baseball. His book &quot;The Science of Hitting&quot; is widely read by students of baseball. He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in 1941. Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them &quot;The Knights of the Keyboard&quot;, and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.

With Williams, the Red Sox reached the 1946 World Series but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games in part because of the use of the &quot;Williams Shift&quot;, a defensive tactic in which the shortstop moves to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field. Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game. His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier. Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 at-bats for a .200 average.

The Cardinals won the 1946 Series when Enos Slaughter scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a base hit to left field. The throw from Leon Culberson was cut off by shortstop Johnny Pesky, who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late. Some say Pesky hesitated or &quot;held the ball&quot; before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.

Along with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman Bobby Doerr and center fielder Dom DiMaggio (the younger brother of Joe DiMaggio).

The Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in 1948 and 1949. In 1948, Boston finished in a tie with Cleveland, and their loss to Cleveland in a one-game playoff ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series. Curiously, manager Joseph McCarthy chose journeyman Denny Galehouse to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom Mel Parnell was available to pitch. In 1949, the Red Sox were one game ahead of the New York Yankees, with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.

The 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox. After Williams returned from the Korean War in 1953, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded. The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox&#x27; daily lineup &quot;Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Jackie Robinson was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however, owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team. Willie Mays also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts. In 1955, Frank Malzone debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in 1957, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for. Williams retired at the end of the 1960 season, famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the John Updike story &quot;Hub fans bid Kid adieu.&quot; The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an African American player when they promoted infielder Pumpsie Green from their AAA farm team in 1959.

===1960s: Yaz and the Impossible Dream===
The 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of Carl &quot;Yaz&quot; Yastrzemski, Williams&#x27; replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.

Red Sox fans know 1967 as the season of the &quot;Impossible Dream&quot;. The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular musical play &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;. 1967 saw one of the great pennant races in baseball history with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game. The BoSox had finished the 1966 season in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team won the pennant to reach the 1967 World Series. Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 home runs and 121 runs batted in. He was named the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, just one vote shy of a unanimous selection as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder César Tovar first on his ballot. But the Red Sox lost the series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Cardinals pitcher Bob Gibson stymied the Red Sox, winning three games.
An 18-year-old Bostonian rookie named Tony Conigliaro slugged 24 home runs in 1964. &quot;Tony C&quot; became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today. He was struck just above the left cheek bone by a fastball thrown by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Friday, August 18, 1967, and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision. Although he did have a productive season in 1970, he was never the same.

===1970s: The Red Hat Era===
Although the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division. The closest they came to a divisional title was 1972 when they lost by a half-game to the Detroit Tigers. The start of the season was delayed by a players&#x27; strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had. Games lost to the strike were not made up. The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race.

====1975====
The Red Sox won the AL pennant in 1975. The 1975 Red Sox were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders Jim Rice and Fred Lynn, veteran outfielder Dwight Evans, catcher Carlton Fisk, and pitchers Luis Tiant and eccentric junkballer Bill &quot;The Spaceman&quot; Lee. Fred Lynn won both the American League Rookie of the Year award and the Most Valuable Player award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until Ichiro Suzuki did it in 2001. In the 1975 American League Championship Series, the Red Sox swept the Oakland A&#x27;s.
In the 1975 World Series, they faced the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds, also known as The Big Red Machine. Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2. Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history. Down 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox pinch hitter Bernie Carbo hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman Rawly Eastwick to tie the game. In the top of the 11th inning, right fielder Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a Joe Morgan line drive and doubled off Ken Griffey at first base to preserve the tie. In the bottom of the 12th inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball that sliced towards the left-field foul pole above the Green Monster. As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul. The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7–6.

The Red Sox lost game 7, 4–3 even though they had an early 3–0 lead. Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a &quot;Leephus pitch&quot; or &quot;space ball&quot; to Reds first baseman Tony Pérez who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street. The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning. Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, &quot;We won that thing 3 games to 4.&quot;

====1978 pennant race====
In 1978, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race. The Yankees were games behind the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as &quot;The Boston Massacre&quot;), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.

On September 16 the Yankees held a game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees&#x27; magic number to win the division was one—with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the Toronto Blue Jays clinching the division. However, New York lost 9–2 and Boston won 5–0, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.

The most remembered moment from the game was Bucky Dent&#x27;s 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead. The dejected Boston manager, Don Zimmer, gave Mr. Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day, uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left-field wall: &quot;Bucky Fucking Dent!&quot; Reggie Jackson provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees&#x27; 5–4 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to Graig Nettles in foul territory with Rick Burleson representing the tying run at third. Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox got retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park.

===1986 World Series and Game Six===
Carl Yastrzemski retired after the 1983 season, during which the Red Sox finished sixth in the seven-team AL East, posting their worst record since 1966.

However, in 1986, it appeared that the team&#x27;s fortunes were about to change. The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Don Baylor and Wade Boggs. Roger Clemens led the pitching staff, going 24–4 with a 2.48 ERA, and had a 20-strikeout game to win both the American League Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards. Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since Vida Blue in 1971. Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season, left-hander Bruce Hurst went 13–8, striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games. Boston sportswriters that season compared Clemens and Hurst to Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax from the 1960s Los Angeles Dodgers.

The Red Sox won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the California Angels in the ALCS. The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3–1 lead in the series. With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5–2 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5. A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one. With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, Dave Henderson homered off Donnie Moore to put Boston up 6–5. Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the eleventh on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore. The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.

The Red Sox faced a heavily favored New York Mets team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the 1986 World Series. Boston won the first two games in Shea Stadium but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at two games apiece. After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to Shea Stadium looking to garner their first championship in 68 years. However, Game 6 became one of the most devastating losses in club history. After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3–2 lead. Years later, Manager John McNamara said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied. The Mets then scored a run off reliever and former Met Calvin Schiraldi to tie the score 3–3. The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5–3 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman Marty Barrett.

After recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the NBC telecast hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and Bruce Hurst as Most Valuable Player of the World Series. A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as World Series champions. After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory. With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher Gary Carter hit a single. It was followed by singles by Kevin Mitchell and Ray Knight. With Mookie Wilson batting, a wild pitch by Bob Stanley tied the game at 5. Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through Bill Buckner&#x27;s legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.

While Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers—as well as both Wilson and Buckner—have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would have still been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.

Many observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that Dave Stapleton had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games. It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game. After falling behind 3–0, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were &quot;cursed&quot;.

This World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983. Working under Mets&#x27; GM Frank Cashen, with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets&#x27; championship.

===1988–1991: Morgan Magic===
The Red Sox returned to the postseason in 1988. With the club in fourth place midway through the 1988 season at the All-Star break, manager John McNamara was fired and replaced by Walpole resident and longtime minor-league manager Joe Morgan on July 15. The club immediately won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what was called &quot;Morgan Magic&quot;. But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the Oakland Athletics in the ALCS. The Most Valuable Player of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player Dennis Eckersley, who saved all four wins for Oakland. Two years later, in 1990, the Red Sox again won the division and face the Athletics in the ALCS. However, the outcome was the same, with the A&#x27;s sweeping the ALCS in four straight.

In 1990, Yankees fans started to chant &quot;1918!&quot; to taunt the Red Sox. The demeaning chant echoed at Yankee Stadium each time the Red Sox were there. Also, Fenway Park became the scene of Bucky Dent&#x27;s worst moment as a manager, although it was where he had his greatest triumph. In June, when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four-game series at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Dent as their manager. Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field, but the Yankees used him as a scapegoat. However, Dan Shaughnessy of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; severely criticized Yankees owner George Steinbrenner for firing Dent—his 18th managerial change in as many years since becoming owner—in Boston and said he should &quot;have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore&quot; to fire Dent. He said that &quot;if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George&#x27;s jettisons. But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook.&quot; &quot;The firing was only special because ... it&#x27;s the first time a Yankee manager—who was also a Red Sox demon—was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay.&quot; However, Bill Pennington called the firing of Dent &quot;merciless&quot;.

===1992–2001: Mixed results===

Tom Yawkey died in 1976, and his wife Jean R. Yawkey took control of the team until her death in 1992. Their initials are shown in two stripes on the left field wall in Morse code. Upon Jean&#x27;s death, control of the team passed to the Yawkey Trust, led by John Harrington. The trust sold the team in 2002, concluding 70 years of Yawkey ownership.

In 1994, General Manager Lou Gorman was replaced by Dan Duquette, a Massachusetts native who had worked for the Montreal Expos. Duquette revived the team&#x27;s farm system, which during his tenure produced players such as Nomar Garciaparra, Carl Pavano and David Eckstein. Duquette also spent money on free agents, notably an 8-year, $160 million deal for Manny Ramírez after the 2000 season.

The Red Sox won the newly realigned American League East in 1995, finishing seven games ahead of the Yankees. However, they were swept in three games in the ALDS by the Cleveland Indians. Their postseason losing streak reached 13 straight games, dating back to the 1986 World Series.

Roger Clemens tied his major league record by fanning 20 Detroit Tigers on September 18, 1996, in one of his final appearances in a Red Sox uniform. After Clemens had turned 30 and then had four seasons, 1993–96, which were by his standards mediocre at best, Duquette said the pitcher was entering &quot;the twilight of his career&quot;. Clemens went on to pitch well for another ten years and win four more Cy Young Awards.

Out of contention in 1997, the team traded closer Heathcliff Slocumb to Seattle for catching prospect Jason Varitek and right-handed pitcher Derek Lowe. Prior to the start of the 1998 season, the Red Sox dealt pitchers Tony Armas Jr. and Carl Pavano to the Montreal Expos for pitcher Pedro Martínez. Martínez became the anchor of the team&#x27;s pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons. In 1998, the team won the American League Wild Card but again lost the American League Division Series to the Indians.

In 1999, Duquette called Fenway Park &quot;economically obsolete&quot; and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium.

On the field, the 1999 Red Sox were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians in the American League Division Series. Cleveland took a 2–0 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Martínez and his brother Ramón Martínez. Game 4&#x27;s 23–7 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history. Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5–2 lead after two innings, but Pedro Martínez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team&#x27;s offense rallied for a 12–8 win behind two home runs and seven runs batted in from outfielder Troy O&#x27;Leary. After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the American League Championship Series to the Yankees, four games to one. The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game.

===2002–present: John Henry era===
====2002–03====
In 2002, the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to New England Sports Ventures, a consortium headed by principal owner John Henry. Tom Werner served as executive chairman, Larry Lucchino served as president and CEO, and serving as vice-chairman was Les Otten. Dan Duquette was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM Mike Port taking the helm for the 2002 season. A week later, manager Joe Kerrigan was fired and was replaced by Grady Little.

While nearly all offseason moves were made under Duquette, such as signing outfielder Johnny Damon away from the Oakland Athletics, the new ownership made additions such as outfielder Cliff Floyd and relief pitcher Alan Embree. Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ramírez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Martínez put up his usual outstanding numbers. Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games—becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons.

After failing to reach the playoffs, Port was replaced by Yale University graduate Theo Epstein. Epstein, raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history.

The 2003 team was known as the &quot;Cowboy Up&quot; team, a nickname derived from first baseman Kevin Millar&#x27;s challenge to his teammates to show more determination. In the 2003 American League Division Series, the Red Sox rallied from a 0–2 series deficit against the Athletics to win the best-of-five series. Derek Lowe returned to his former relief pitching role to save Game 5, a 4–3 victory. The team then faced the Yankees in the 2003 American League Championship Series. In Game 7, Boston led 5–2 in the eighth inning, but Pedro Martínez allowed three runs to tie the game. The Red Sox could not score off Mariano Rivera over the last three innings and eventually lost the game 6–5 when Yankee third baseman Aaron Boone hit a solo home run off Tim Wakefield. Some placed the blame for the loss on manager Grady Little for failing to remove starting pitcher Martínez in the 8th inning after some observers believe he began to show signs of tiring. It was stated by Epstein that the decision to not renew Little&#x27;s contract was &quot;made on a body of work after careful contemplation of the big picture...did not depend on any one decision in any one postseason game.&quot; Boston would hire former Philadelphia Phillies manager Terry Francona to manage the 2004 season.

====&quot;The Idiots&quot;: 2004 World Series Championship====
During the 2003–04 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, Curt Schilling, and a closer, Keith Foulke. Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade. The Red Sox traded the team&#x27;s popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and outfielder Matt Murton to the Chicago Cubs, and received first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins, and shortstop Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder Dave Roberts from the Los Angeles Dodgers. Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as &quot;the Idiots&quot;, a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team&#x27;s eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed &quot;curse&quot;.

Boston began the postseason by sweeping the AL West champion Anaheim Angels in the ALDS. In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s ALCS in the ALCS against the Yankees. The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19–8 home loss in game 3). In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4–3 in the ninth with Mariano Rivera in to close for the Yankees. After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base. He then scored on an RBI single by Bill Mueller, sending the game into extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game 6–4 on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning. The odds were still very much against the Sox in the series, but Ortiz also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of Game 5. The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in Game 6. Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling&#x27;s right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red. With it, Boston became the first team in MLB history to force a series-deciding Game 7 after trailing 3–0 in games. The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in Game 7 with a 10–3 victory over the Yankees. Ortiz began the scoring with a two-run homer. Along with his game-winning runs batted in during games 4 and 5, he was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders as the only North American professional sports teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down 3–0. (The 2010 Philadelphia Flyers and the 2014 Los Angeles Kings would later accomplish the feat).

The Red Sox swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; Mark Bellhorn hit a game-winning home run off Pesky&#x27;s Pole in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and Derek Lowe. It was the Red Sox&#x27; first championship in 86 years. Manny Ramírez was named World Series MVP. To add a final, surreal touch to Boston&#x27;s championship season, on the night of Game 4 a total lunar eclipse colored the moon red over Busch Stadium. The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their season, such as in December, when &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 Sportsmen of the Year.

====2007: World Series Championship====

The 2005 AL East was decided on the last weekend of the season, with the Yankees coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings. The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95–67. However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a wild card team. As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the wild card team. Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual 2005 World Series champion Chicago White Sox in the first round of the playoffs. In 2006 David Ortiz broke Jimmie Foxx&#x27;s single-season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers. However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9–21 record in the month of August due to several injuries in the club&#x27;s roster.

Theo Epstein&#x27;s first step toward restocking the team for 2007 was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history. On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball superstar pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka. Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid.

The Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead. Initially, rookie second baseman Dustin Pedroia under-performed, hitting below .200 in April. Manager Terry Francona refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the AL Rookie of the Year Award for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average. On the mound, Josh Beckett emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and Julián Tavárez all struggled at times. Relief pitcher Hideki Okajima, another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game. Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball&#x27;s top relievers. Minor league call-up Clay Buchholz provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a no-hitter in his second career start. The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.

The Red Sox swept the Angels in the ALDS. Facing the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS, the Red Sox fell in games 2, 3, and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5, starting a comeback. The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30–5 over the final three games. The Red Sox faced the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, and swept the Rockies in four games. In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered Jon Lester, who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching shutout innings. Key home runs late in the game by third baseman Mike Lowell and pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty secured the Red Sox&#x27; second title in four years, as Lowell was named Most Valuable Player in the World Series.

====2008–2012: Injuries and collapses====
The Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the Oakland A&#x27;s in the Tokyo Dome. On May 19, Jon Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the Kansas City Royals 7–0. Down the stretch, outfielder Manny Ramirez became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries. The front office decided to move the disgruntled outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates that landed them Jason Bay to replace him in left field. With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. The Red Sox defeated the Angels in the 2008 ALDS three games to one. The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS. Down three games to one in the 5th game of the ALCS, Boston mounted a comeback from trailing 7–0 in the 7th inning to win 8–7. They tied the series at three games apiece with a Game 6 victory before losing Game 7, 3–1, thus becoming the eighth team in a row since 2000 to fail to repeat as World Series champions.

The Red Sox returned to postseason play in 2009 but were swept in the ALDS by the Los Angeles Angels. In 2010, they placed third in the division and failed to make the playoffs. In 2011, the Red Sox collapsed, becoming the first team in MLB history to blow a 9-game lead in the division heading into September, going 7–20 in the final month and failing again to make the playoffs. In December 2011, Bobby Valentine was hired as a new manager. The 2012 season marked the centennial of Fenway Park, and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park&#x27;s anniversary. However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season. The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news. They finished 69–93 for their first losing season since 1997 and their worst season since 1965.

====Boston Strong: 2013 World Series Champions====

Boston, which finished last in the American League East with a 69–93 record in 2012 (26 games behind the Yankees), became the 11th team in major league history to go from worst in the division to first the next season when it clinched the A.L. East division title on September 20, 2013. Many credit the team&#x27;s turnaround with the hiring of manager John Farrell, the former Red Sox pitching coach under Terry Francona from 2007 to 2010. As a former member of the staff, he had the respect of influential players such as Lester, Pedroia, and Ortiz. But there were other moves made in the offseason by general manager Ben Cherington who targeted &quot;character&quot; players to fill the team&#x27;s needs. These acquisitions included veteran catcher David Ross, Jonny Gomes, Mike Napoli and Shane Victorino. While some questioned these players as &quot;re-treads&quot;, it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011–2012 by bringing in &quot;clubhouse players&quot;. Essential to the turnaround, however, was the pitching staff. With ace veteran John Lackey coming off Tommy John surgery and both Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen. Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both closers, Joel Hanrahan and Andrew Bailey, went down early with season-ending injuries. Farrell gave the closing job to Koji Uehara on June 21 who delivered with a 1.09 ERA and an MLB record 0.565 WHIP. On September 11, the 37-year-old right-hander set a new Red Sox record when he retired 33 straight batters. Other reasons include the trade deadline acquisition of pitcher Jake Peavy when the Red Sox were in second place in the AL East, the depth of the bench with players such as Mike Carp and rookies Jackie Bradley Jr. and Xander Bogaerts, and the re-emergence of players such as Will Middlebrooks and Daniel Nava. On September 28, 2013, the team secured home field advantage throughout the American League playoffs when their closest competition, the Oakland Athletics, lost. The next day, the team finished the season going 97–65, the best record in the American League and tied with the St. Louis Cardinals for the best record in baseball. They proceeded to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2013 World Series, four games to two. The Red Sox became the first team since the 1991 Minnesota Twins to win the World Series a year after finishing in last place, and the second overall. The 2012 Red Sox&#x27;s .426 winning percentage was the lowest for a team in a season prior to a World Series championship.

Throughout the season, the Red Sox players and organization formed a close association with the city of Boston and its people in relation to the Boston Marathon bombing that occurred on April 15, 2013. On April 20, the day after the alleged bombers were captured, David Ortiz gave a pre-game speech following a ceremony honoring the victims and the local law enforcement, in which he stated, &quot;This is our fucking city! And nobody is going to dictate our freedom! Stay strong!&quot; For the entirety of the season, the team wore an additional arm patch that exhibited the Red Sox &quot;B&quot; logo and the word &quot;Strong&quot; within a blue circle. The team also hung up in the dugout a custom jersey that read &quot;Boston Strong&quot; with the number 617, representing the city of Boston&#x27;s area code. On many occasions during the season, victims of the attack and law enforcement involved were given the honor of throwing the ceremonial first pitch. Following their victory in the 2013 World Series, the first one clinched at home in Fenway Park since 1918, Red Sox players Jonny Gomes and Jarrod Saltalamacchia performed a ceremony during the team&#x27;s traditional duck boat victory parade, in which they placed the World Series trophy and the custom 617 jersey on the Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston Street, followed by a moment of silence and the singing of &quot;God Bless America&quot;. This ceremony helped the city &quot;reclaim&quot; its spirit that was lost after the bombing. Overall, the Red Sox team and organization played a role in the healing process after the tragedy, owing to the team&#x27;s unifying effect on the city.

====2014–2017====
Following the 2013 championship, the team finished last in the AL East during 2014 with a record of 71–91, and again in 2015 with a record of 78–84. On September 12, 2015, David Ortiz hit his 500th career home run off Matt Moore in Tropicana Field becoming the 27th player in MLB history to achieve that prestigious milestone; in November 2015, Ortiz announced that the 2016 season was to be his last.

The Red Sox had a record of 93–69 and won their division in 2016, with six American League All-Stars, the AL Cy Young Award winner in Rick Porcello, and the runner-up for the AL Most Valuable Player Award, Mookie Betts. Rookie Andrew Benintendi established himself in the Red Sox outfield, and Steven Wright emerged as one of the year&#x27;s biggest surprises. The Red Sox grabbed the lead in the AL East early and held on to it throughout the year, which included many teams honoring Ortiz throughout the season. Despite the success, the team lost five of their last six games of the regular season and were swept in the ALDS by the eventual American League Champion Cleveland Indians. The Red Sox once again finished with a record of 93–69 in 2017 and repeated as division champions. The team went 5–5 in their last ten regular-season games and were eliminated by the Houston Astros in the ALDS in four games. The Red Sox subsequently fired their manager, John Farrell, and hired Alex Cora, signing him to a three-year deal.

====&quot;Damage done&quot;: 2018 World Series Championship====

The Red Sox finished with a record, winning the American League East division title for the third consecutive season, eight games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees, and were the first team to clinch a berth in the 2018 postseason. The Red Sox surpassed the 100-win mark for the first time since 1946, broke the franchise record of 105 wins that had been set in 1912, and won the most games of any MLB team since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116. The 2018 Red Sox were led by All-Stars Mookie Betts, J. D. Martinez, Chris Sale, and Craig Kimbrel. Betts led baseball in batting average and slugging percentage, while Martinez led in runs batted in. Sale tossed only 158 innings due to a shoulder injury late in the year, but was otherwise superb, posting a 2.11 earned run average to go along with 237 strikeouts. Kimbrel saved 42 games and struck out 96 batters.

The Red Sox entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League, and defeated the New York Yankees (100–62) in four games in the Division Series. Next, they defeated the defending champion Houston Astros (103–59) in five games in the League Championship Series. Boston then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers (92–71) in five games in the World Series, for the team&#x27;s fourth championship in 15 years and ninth in franchise history. The team&#x27;s motto during the season, &quot;do damage&quot;, became &quot;damage done&quot; upon their victory.

Based on these exploits, the team is considered the best MLB team of the 2010s, one of the best Red Sox teams ever, and one of the best baseball teams since the 1998 New York Yankees.

====2019–present: Decline and struggles ====
Despite retaining most players from the 2018 championship team, the 2019 Red Sox won 24 fewer games, finishing third in the division and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2015. President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski was dismissed following a September loss to the Yankees. On October 28, the Red Sox hired Chaim Bloom as his replacement on a five-year contract, with the title of Chief Baseball Officer.

On January 7, 2020, it was reported in &quot;The Athletic&quot; that the Red Sox had used their video replay room to steal signs during their 2018 season. On January 15, the Red Sox and manager Alex Cora agreed to mutually part ways after he was named in the MLB&#x27;s report about the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, which occurred during his tenure as bench coach with the 2017 Astros. Ron Roenicke was subsequently named Boston&#x27;s interim manager. On February 10, a trade of Mookie Betts and David Price to the Los Angeles Dodgers was made official, in a move seen as a salary dump by analysts, although denied by Red Sox executives. In March, the start of the MLB season was indefinitely postponed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, the MLB&#x27;s investigation into 2018 sign-stealing resulted in a finding of improper actions by the team&#x27;s replay operator, who as a result was suspended for the 2020 season, and the team forfeited their second-round selection in the 2020 MLB draft. The &quot;interim&quot; tag was subsequently removed from Roenicke&#x27;s title. The team struggled throughout their abbreviated 60-game regular season, contested July 24 through September 27, finishing in last place in the AL East division, with a record of 24–36. Prior to the final regular season game, management announced that Roenicke would not return as manager for the 2021 season.

Alex Cora returned as manager for the 2021 season, with the team finishing at 92–70 and qualifying for the postseason as the fourth seed in the AL. The Red Sox defeated the Yankees in the AL Wild Card Game, and defeated the Rays in the Division Series, but were eliminated by the Astros in the League Championship Series. The 2022 season was much less successful, with the team finishing in last place within their division with a 78–84 record, the first losing record for the team in a 162-game season since 2015. In 2023, the Red Sox once again finished in last place in their division with a 78–84 record.

Bloom was fired on September 14, 2023. His replacement, Craig Breslow, an executive with the Chicago Cubs and former pitcher for the Red Sox, was hired on October 25, 2023.

==Roster==
== Ballpark ==

The Red Sox have played their home games at Fenway Park since 1912, making the ballpark the oldest active ballpark in Major League Baseball, as well as the oldest active venue across the four major North American sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL). Previously, the team played at the Huntington Avenue Grounds from its inception in 1901 through 1911.

=== Regular season home attendance ===

Between May 15, 2003, and April 10, 2013, the Red Sox sold out every home game at Fenway park. The 820-game streak is a record for all major American sports, narrowly passing the Portland Trail Blazers record of 814 between 1977 and 1995. The previous major league baseball record had been held by the Cleveland Indians, who sold out 455 games between June 12, 1995, and April 2, 2001.

 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season was contested behind closed doors, and some 2021 games were contested with limited attendance per local ordinances.

==Uniforms==
==Spring training==
The franchise&#x27;s first spring training was held in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1901, when the team was known as the Boston Americans. Since 1993, the city of Fort Myers, Florida, has hosted Boston&#x27;s spring training, first at City of Palms Park, and since 2012 at JetBlue Park at Fenway South.
===JetBlue Park===

In October 2008, the Lee County, Florida, Board of Commissioners approved an agreement with the Red Sox to build a new spring training facility for the team. In November 2008, the Red Sox signed an agreement with Lee County intended to keep their spring training home in the Fort Myers area for 30 more years. In April 2009, the Red Sox announced that the new stadium would be located on a lot north of Southwest Florida International Airport. In March 2011, the team and JetBlue Airlines officials announced that the new field would be named JetBlue Park at Fenway South.

JetBlue Park opened in March 2012. Many characteristics of the stadium have been taken from Fenway Park, including a Green Monster wall in left field. Included in the wall is a restored version of the manual scoreboard that was housed at Fenway for almost 30 years, beginning in the 1970s. The field dimensions are identical to those at Fenway.

===Truck Day===
The unofficial beginning of the spring training season for the Red Sox is Truck Day, the day a tractor-trailer filled with equipment leaves Fenway Park bound for the team&#x27;s spring training facility in Florida. 2021&#x27;s Truck Day was February 8.

==Rivalries==
===New York Yankees===

The Red Sox and New York Yankees have been rivals for more than 100 years. The rivalry is often considered one of the oldest, fiercest and most famous rivalries in professional sports.

The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation in the Northeastern United States. Since the inception of the wild card team and an added Division Series, every postseason except for 2014 and 2023 has featured one or both of the American League East rivals. The two teams have squared off in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) three times, with the Yankees winning in 1999 and 2003 and the Sox winning in 2004. The teams have faced off in one American League Division Series (ALDS); 2018, won by the Red Sox in four games. The teams have played one American League Wild Card Game on October 5, 2021, which the Red Sox won as well.

The teams have twice met in the last regular-season series to decide the league title, in 1904 (which the Red Sox won) and 1949 (which the Yankees won). The teams also finished tied for first in 1978, when the Yankees won a high-profile one-game playoff for the division title. The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. In 2003, The Red Sox lost in Game 7 of the ALCS on Aaron Boone&#x27;s walk-off home run. Similarly, the 2004 ALCS is notable for the Yankees leading 3 games to 0 and ultimately losing the best-of-seven series. The Red Sox comeback was the first time in major league history that a team came back from an 0–3 deficit to win a series.

The rivalry is often termed &quot;the best&quot; and &quot;greatest rivalry in all of sports.&quot; Games between the two teams often generate a great deal of interest and get extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television.

===Tampa Bay Rays===

The rivalry between Boston and the Tampa Bay Rays developed in the late 2000s, after the two clubs had their first postseason meeting in the 2008 ALCS. Since then, both teams have won the American League East division a combined seven times. While the rivalry is more recent than Sox&#x27; rivalry with the Yankees, it has been called one of the most competitive in modern baseball.

The teams have met three times in the MLB postseason, with the Rays winning the 2008 ALCS and the Red Sox winning the 2013 ALDS and 2021 ALDS.

== Media ==

=== Radio and television ===

The flagship radio station of the Red Sox is WEEI-FM 93.7. Joe Castiglione has broadcast Red Sox games since 1983 (initially assisting Ken Coleman) and has been the lead play-by-play announcer since 1993. Tim Neverett worked with him from 2016 through 2018, but in 2019, WEEI opted for a more conversational format with a variety of commentators (see the above link) alongside Castiglione. Former Red Sox player Lou Merloni has provided color commentary since 2013. Castiglione&#x27;s predecessors include Curt Gowdy and Ned Martin. He has also worked with play-by-play veterans Bob Starr and Jerry Trupiano. Many stations throughout New England and beyond carry the broadcasts. On August 26, 2024, Rylee Pay and Emma Tiedemann became the first pair of women to call a Red Sox game.

All Red Sox telecasts not shown nationally are available on New England Sports Network (NESN), with Dave O&#x27;Brien calling play-by-play, and Kevin Youkilis, Kevin Millar and Will Middlebrooks splitting color commentary duties. Jerry Remy, a former Red Sox second baseman, served as color analyst from 1988 up until his death in 2021. Remy had lung cancer, and would at times step away from broadcasting duties to focus on his health. Former Red Sox pitcher Dennis Eckersley worked as a color commentator for NESN until his retirement following the 2022 season. Several local television stations, including the original WHDH-TV, WNAC-TV (now the current WHDH), WBZ-TV, WSBK-TV, WLVI, WABU, and WFXT, broadcast Red Sox games prior to 2006, when NESN became the exclusive home of the team.

=== Music ===

The integration of music into the culture of the Red Sox dates back to the Americans era, which saw the first use of the popular 1902 showtune &quot;Tessie&quot; as a rallying cry by fans. The tune saw a resurgence in popularity when a new version by Boston area band The Dropkick Murphys was featured in the 2005 film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, which tells the story of an obsessive Red Sox fan. The song is frequently played after home wins and inspired the name of Red Sox mascot Wally the Green Monster&#x27;s &quot;sister&quot; &quot;Tessie&quot;. Their song &quot;I&#x27;m Shipping Up to Boston&quot; was used to signify the entrance of Boston&#x27;s closing pitcher.

&quot;Dirty Water&quot; by The Standells is played immediately after the final play of each Red Sox home win, followed by the Dropkick Murphys&#x27; &quot;Tessie&quot;

Another song associated with the team and its fan base is Neil Diamond&#x27;s 1969 single &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot;. The song was first introduced to Fenway Park in 1997. By 2002, its play had been established as a nightly occurrence. It continues to be played at every home game during the 8th inning, sung along to by those in attendance. In 2007, Diamond revealed that the song was written for Caroline Kennedy, American diplomat and daughter of Boston icon President John F. Kennedy. Caroline Kennedy&#x27;s great-grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald, threw Fenway Park&#x27;s first-ever ceremonial opening pitch on April 20, 1912. When Diamond was named a Kennedy Center Honors recipient in 2011, Red Sox executive assistant Claire Durant arranged for 80 Red Sox fans to travel to Washington for the ceremony, which culminated in them singing the song behind Smokey Robinson onstage.

== Honors and achievements ==

=== Awards ===

For major MLB awards, voted by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA), Red Sox players have won the MVP Award 12 times, most recently by Mookie Betts in 2018; the Cy Young Award seven times, most recently by Rick Porcello in 2016; Rookie of the Year six times, most recently by Dustin Pedroia in 2007; and Manager of the Year twice, most recently by Jimy Williams in 1999.

=== Retired numbers ===
Previously, the Red Sox published three official requirements for a player to have his number retired on their website and in their annual media guides. The requirements were as follows:
#Election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
#At least 10 years played with the Red Sox
#Finished his career with the club.

These requirements were reconsidered after the election of Carlton Fisk to the Hall of Fame in 2000; who met the first two requirements but played the second half of his career with the Chicago White Sox. As a means of meeting the criteria, then-GM Dan Duquette hired Fisk for one day as a special assistant, which allowed Fisk to technically finish his career with the Red Sox.

In 2008, the Red Sox made an &quot;exception&quot; by retiring number 6 for Johnny Pesky. Pesky neither spent ten years as a player nor was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame; however, Red Sox ownership cited &quot;... his versatility of his contributions—on the field, off the field, [and] in the dugout ...&quot;, including as a manager, scout, and special instructor and decided that the honor had been well-earned. Pesky spent 57 years with the Red Sox organization; as a minor league player (1940–1941), major league player (1942, 1946–1952), minor league manager (1961–1962, 1990), major league manager (1963–1964, 1980), broadcaster (1969–1974), major league coach (1975–1984), and as a special instructor and assistant general manager (1985–2012).

In 2015, the Red Sox chose to forgo the official criteria and retire Pedro Martínez&#x27; number 45. Martínez only spent seven of his 18 seasons in Boston. In justifying the number&#x27;s retirement, Red Sox principal owner John Henry stated, &quot;To be elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame upon his first year of eligibility speaks volumes regarding Pedro&#x27;s outstanding career, and is a testament to the respect and admiration so many in baseball have for him.&quot; After announcing Martínez&#x27;s number retirement, the official criteria no longer appeared on the team website nor future media guides.

In 2017, less than eight months after he played the final game of his illustrious career, David Ortiz had his number 34 retired by the Red Sox. Ortiz was elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2022. To date, Ortiz is the only Red Sox player to have been on the active playoff roster of three World Series championship teams (2004, 2007, 2013) since the issuance of jersey numbers starting in 1931.

The number 42 was officially retired by Major League Baseball in 1997, but Mo Vaughn was one of a handful of players to continue wearing number 42 due to a grandfather clause. He last wore it for the team in 1998. In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15, which Coco Crisp (CF), David Ortiz (DH), and DeMarlo Hale (Coach) did in 2007 and again in 2008. Starting in 2009, MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear number 42 for Jackie Robinson Day.

While not officially retired, the Red Sox have not issued several numbers since the departure of prominent figures who wore them, specifically:
* 15 – Dustin Pedroia 2B (MLB 2006–2019; all with Boston)
* 21 – Roger Clemens RHP (MLB 1984–2007; Boston 1984–1996)
* 33 – Jason Varitek C (MLB 1997–2011; all with Boston). Varitek reclaimed his #33 when he became a coach in 2021.
* 49 – Tim Wakefield RHP (MLB 1992–1993, 1995–2011; Boston 1995–2011)

There has also been debate in Boston media circles and among fans about the potential retiring of Tony Conigliaro&#x27;s number 25. Nonetheless, since Conigliaro&#x27;s last full season in Boston, 1970, the number has never been taken out of circulation and issued to multiple players—notably Troy O&#x27;Leary from 1995 to 2001—along with coach Dwight Evans in 2002 and manager Bobby Valentine in 2012.

Until the late 1990s, the numbers originally hung on the right-field facade in the order in which they were retired: 9–4–1–8. It was pointed out that the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first game of the 1918 World Series, the last championship series that the Red Sox won before 2004. After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged in numerical order. In 2012, the numbers were rearranged again in chronological order of retirement (9, 4, 1, 8, 27, 6, 14) followed by Robinson&#x27;s 42. As additional numbers were retired, Robinson&#x27;s 42 was moved to the right so it remains the right-most number hanging.

=== Baseball Hall of Famers ===


==== Ford C. Frick Award recipients ====
==== BBWAA Career Excellence Award recipients ====

Several baseball writers, professionally based in Boston while writing about the Red Sox, have been recipients of the BBWAA Career Excellence Award (formerly the J. G. Taylor Spink Award), given for &quot;meritorious contributions to baseball writing&quot;. Each of these writers spent at least part of their career with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

=== Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame ===
Since 1995, the team has maintained its own hall of fame, recognizing distinguished careers of former uniformed and non-uniformed team personnel. Red Sox personnel inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame are automatically inducted to the team&#x27;s hall of fame. Other honorees are chosen via a 15-member selection committee.

=== Notable records and achievements ===

*David Ortiz set the franchise record for home runs in a season with 54 in 2006, surpassing Jimmie Foxx&#x27;s record of 50 home runs set in 1938.
*On April 22, 2007, Manny Ramírez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four consecutive home runs in the 3rd inning off 10 pitches from Chase Wright of the New York Yankees. This was the fifth time in Major League history and the first time in Red Sox history this feat has occurred. Notable is that J. D. Drew had previously contributed to a four consecutive home run sequence on September 18, 2006 (coincidentally also the second batter in the sequence) while with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Additionally, then-Red Sox manager Terry Francona&#x27;s father, Tito Francona, also was a part of such a four consecutive home run sequence for the Cleveland Indians in 1963.
*On September 22, 2007, with a victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, the Red Sox clinched a spot in the postseason for the fourth time in five years, the first time in club history this has happened. Also, with this postseason berth, manager Terry Francona became the first manager in team history to lead the club to three playoff appearances.
* In 2016, David Ortiz set all-time records for most home runs and runs batted in in a player&#x27;s final MLB season. Ortiz finished the season with 38 homers, which surpassed Dave Kingman&#x27;s 35 in 1986, and 127 runs batted in, which surpassed Shoeless Joe Jackson&#x27;s 123 in 1920.
*The Red Sox set a team record for wins in a regular season with 108 in 2018, surpassing the 106-year-old record of 105 wins set in 1912. Including playoffs, the Red Sox won a total of 119 games, the third most total wins in an MLB season.
*With their victory in the 2018 World Series, the Red Sox became the first team to win four World Series championships in the twenty-first century. They also achieved this with their third (2013) and second (2007) championships in the century respectively, after first winning in 2004.

==== No-hitters ====
There have been 18 no-hitters thrown in Red Sox history, most recently by Jon Lester on May 19, 2008, against the Kansas City Royals. The franchise&#x27;s first no-hitter is also the only perfect game in franchise history so far, thrown by Cy Young on May 5, 1904, against the Philadelphia Athletics.

The first Red Sox rookie to throw a no-hitter was Clay Buchholz, doing so against the Baltimore Orioles on September 1, 2007, in his second Major League start.

==== Hitting for the cycle ====

Red Sox batters have hit for the cycle 23 times in franchise history, tied for second most (with the San Francisco Giants) for all franchises behind the Pittsburgh Pirates, who have hit 24. On October 8, 2018, Brock Holt became the first player in MLB history to hit for the cycle in the postseason, doing so in a 16–1 win over the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the 2018 American League Division Series.

The following is a list of Boston Red Sox players who have hit for the cycle:

# Buck Freeman — June 21, 1903

<text>The Baltimore Orioles (also known as the O&#x27;s) are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore. The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League (AL) East Division. As one of the American League&#x27;s eight charter teams in 1901, the franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee as the [[Milwaukee Brewers (1894–1901)|Milwaukee Brewers]] before moving to St. Louis to become the [[St. Louis Browns]] in 1902. After 52 years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests, led by attorney and civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro Jr. The team&#x27;s current owner is David Rubenstein. The Orioles&#x27; home ballpark is Oriole Park at Camden Yards, which opened in 1992 in downtown Baltimore. 
The oriole is the official state bird of Maryland; the name has been used by several baseball clubs in the city, including another AL charter member franchise which folded after the 1902 season and was replaced the next year by the New York Highlanders, later the Yankees. Nicknames for the team include the &quot;O&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;Birds&quot;.

The franchise&#x27;s first World Series appearance came in when the Browns lost to the St. Louis Cardinals. The Orioles went on to make six World Series appearances from 1966 to 1983, winning three in , , and . This era of the club featured several future Hall of Famers who would later be inducted representing the Orioles, such as third baseman Brooks Robinson, outfielder Frank Robinson, starting pitcher Jim Palmer, first baseman Eddie Murray, shortstop Cal Ripken Jr., and manager Earl Weaver. The Orioles have won a total of ten division championships (1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1983, 1997, 2014, 2023), seven pennants (1944 while in St. Louis, 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979, 1983), and four wild card berths (1996, 2012, 2016, 2024). The franchise was the last charter member of the American League to win a pennant, and the last charter member to win a World Series.

After 14 consecutive losing seasons between 1998 and 2011, the team qualified for the postseason three times under manager Buck Showalter and general manager Dan Duquette, including a division title and advancement to the American League Championship Series for the first time in 17 years in 2014. Four years later, the Orioles lost 115 games, the most in franchise history. The Orioles chose not to renew the expired contracts of Showalter and Duquette after the season, ending their respective tenures with Baltimore. The Orioles&#x27; current manager is Brandon Hyde, while Mike Elias serves as general manager and executive vice president. Two years after finishing 52–110 in 2021, the Orioles went 101–61 in 2023, en route to winning the AL East for the first time since 2014.

From 1901 through the end of 2024, the franchise&#x27;s overall win–loss record is (). Since moving to Baltimore in 1954, the Orioles have an overall win–loss record of () through the end of 2024.

==History==

The Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers of the Western League (WL), beginning in 1894 when the league reorganized. The Brewers were still league members when the WL renamed itself the American League (AL) in 1900. At the end of the 1900 season, the AL removed itself from baseball&#x27;s National Agreement, the formal understanding between the National League (NL) and the minor leagues, and declared itself a competing major league. During 1901, the first season the AL operated as a major league, the Brewers finished last among the league&#x27;s eight teams.

In 1902, the team moved to St. Louis and became the &quot;Browns&quot;, named after the original name of the 1880s club now known as the Cardinals. Although they usually fielded mediocre teams, they were very popular at the gate. In 1916, after years of prosperity at the gate, Robert Hedges sold the team to Phil Ball, who made a considerable effort to make the Browns competitive. However, Ball&#x27;s tenure was marked by errors, including the firing of Branch Rickey, which eventually benefited the Cardinals, who shared Sportsman&#x27;s Park with the Browns.

The 1944 season saw the Browns winning their only St. Louis-based American League pennant, becoming the last of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues from 1901 to 1960, to play in a World Series. In 1951, Bill Veeck purchased the Browns and introduced a series of promotions and wild antics. Veeck&#x27;s efforts to drive the Cardinals out of St. Louis failed when Anheuser-Busch purchased the Cardinals. Veeck attempted to move the Browns to Milwaukee and then Baltimore, but both moves were initially blocked by other American League owners. Eventually, Veeck sold his stake to a group of Baltimore investors, and the team moved to Baltimore for the 1954 season, renaming themselves the Baltimore Orioles. The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by Baltimore baseball teams since the late 19th century. The Orioles&#x27; early years in Baltimore were marked by a gradual climb to respectability, leading to their first World Series title in 1966. The Orioles enjoyed a period of sustained success from 1966 to 1983, winning three World Series titles and six American League pennants.

After the 1983 World Series win, the Orioles experienced a decline, culminating in the 1988 season where they lost the first 21 games. In 1989, the Orioles showed improvement with the &quot;Why Not?&quot; Orioles finishing second in the AL East. The opening of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in 1992 marked a new era, and the team returned to the playoffs in 1996 and 1997. However, the late 1990s and 2000s were characterized by losing seasons and rebuilding efforts. The Orioles saw a resurgence in the 2010s, making the playoffs in 2012, 2014, and 2016, with Buck Showalter as manager. The team struggled again towards the end of the decade, leading to a major rebuild. The 2020s have been marked by rebuilding efforts and developing young talent, aiming for future competitiveness.

=== Return to success and ownership changes (2022–present) ===
In 2022, anticipated first-round pick catcher Adley Rutschman made his major-league debut in addition to rookie closer Félix Bautista. The Orioles finished the 2022 season with a 83–79 record, becoming the second team in MLB history to have a winning season only one year after losing 110 or more games.

On June 9, 2022, Louis Angelos sued his brother, Orioles chairman and CEO John P. Angelos, and mother Georgia Angelos in Baltimore County Circuit Court. Louis Angelos claims that their father intended for the brothers and their mother to share control of the team. The lawsuit states the elder Angelos collapsed in 2017 due to heart problems and established a trust with his wife and sons as co-trustees. Louis Angelos is seeking to have his brother and mother removed as co-trustees of the trust that controls the Orioles and removed as co-agents of Peter Angelos&#x27; power of attorney.

The suit claims Georgia Angelos wants to sell the team and an advisor attempted to negotiate a sale in 2020 but John Angelos vetoed a potential deal. The suit claims Angelos unilaterally fired long-time employees loyal to his father, including former center fielder Brady Anderson, the longtime special assistant to the executive vice president for baseball operations. The suit claims John Angelos transferred tens of millions of dollars&#x27; worth of property out of his father&#x27;s law firm and into a limited liability company controlled by his personal attorney. In separate statements released by the team, Georgia and John Angelos refuted the claims. In the event of any sale, Major League Baseball has reportedly encouraged Cal Ripken Jr to be part of any incoming ownership group that may take control of the team.

====2023====
In April 2023, the Orioles went 19–9, setting a franchise record for wins in the month of April. By August 2023, the Orioles, led by a core of first-and-second-year players Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, Félix Bautista and Kyle Bradish, were in first place in the division and described in &quot;The Athletic&quot; as &quot;young, fun and arguably the best story in baseball.&quot; However, the front office went under scrutiny when it was reported that play-by-play announcer Kevin Brown had been suspended indefinitely by the Orioles for his pregame remarks on MASN, the team-owned network, two weeks earlier. During a &quot;seemingly benign&quot; introduction to a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Brown observed that the team had not won a series at Tropicana Field in the past several seasons. It was described in &quot;The Athletic&quot; as a &quot;petty&quot; move by John Angelos, &quot;the only person [in the organization] with enough power that no one dare question the validity of anything he says and does, no matter how foolish it is.&quot; Several broadcasters came to Brown&#x27;s defense after the news broke. Gary Cohen said the team had &quot;draped itself in utter humiliation&quot; and Michael Kay said the suspension made &quot;the Orioles look so small and insignificant and minor league.&quot; Brown returned to broadcasting for the team and stated in a public message that &quot;recent media reports [had] mischaracterized my relationship with my adopted hometown Orioles&quot; and that his relationship with the team was &quot;wonderful&quot;.

In May 2023, following the team&#x27;s new water-themed celebrations, Camden Yards created a Bird Bath splash zone in left field, where fans in one section had the opportunity get sprayed by the water hose-wielding &quot;Mr. Splash&quot; following an Orioles extra base hit.

The Orioles finished the 2023 season with a record of 101–61, winning the American League East division for the first time since 2014, and claiming their first 100+ win season since 1980. On July 30, the pitching staff of Dean Kremer, Mike Baumann, Shintaro Fujinami, Danny Coulombe, and Yennier Canó combined to set a franchise record for the most strikeouts in a 9-inning game against the Yankees. The 2023 pitching staff also broke the Orioles franchise record of single-season strikeouts on September 6. However, the team&#x27;s successful season ended in the postseason American League Division Series, with the Orioles losing three straight games to the Texas Rangers. The series sweep was the first time since the 2022 season that the Orioles had been swept in a series.

Manager Brandon Hyde was awarded 2023 AL Manager of the Year, and players Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson both were awarded the Silver Slugger Award. Additionally, Henderson was voted unanimous AL Rookie of the Year, marking the first time the team had a ROY winner since Gregg Olson in 1989.

====2024====

In January 2024, John Angelos reached a $1.7 billion deal to sell the Orioles to a group led by David Rubenstein, a Baltimore native and founder of The Carlyle Group. The group includes Cal Ripken, New York investment manager Michael Arougheti, former Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke, businessman Michael Bloomberg and NBA hall of famer Grant Hill. For tax reasons, the group will acquire 40% of the team with the Angelos family selling the remainder of Peter Angelos&#x27; stake after his death. The deal includes the Orioles&#x27; majority stake in MASN. Peter Angelos died aged 94 on March 23, 2024; his death occurred four days before the sale of the Orioles was finalized.

On August 1, 2024, the Orioles&#x27; majority ownership group led by private equity billionaire David Rubenstein took full control of the team, when a deal closed for the group to purchase the remainder of the organization.

*In 1954, 1989–94 (road) and 1995–2003 (home), the scripted word &quot;Orioles&quot; and block letters are rendered in black with orange trim. The 1995–2003 style featured orange numbers in front but black letters in the back.
*From 1963 to 1965, the home uniforms featured &quot;Orioles&quot; in block lettering instead of the more familiar cursive script style. It was also rendered in black with orange trim.
*The underline below the word &quot;Orioles&quot; disappeared from 1966 to 1988.
*Road uniforms bore the team name from 1954 to 1955 and from 1973 to 2008.
*Extra white trim was added to the road and alternate uniforms from 1995 to 2000.
*Sleeveless home alternate uniforms were used in the 1968 and 1969 seasons.
*Player names were added to the uniforms in 1966, but the home uniforms originally featured black block letters. It would not match the road uniform lettering until 1971, which were orange with black trim.

A long campaign of several decades was waged by numerous fans and sportswriters to return the name of the city to the &quot;away&quot; jerseys which was used since the 1950s and had been formerly dropped during the 1970s era of Edward Bennett Williams when the ownership was continuing to market the team also to fans in the nation&#x27;s capital region after the moving of the former Washington Senators in 1971. After several decades, approximately 20% of the team&#x27;s attendance came from the metro Washington area.

In 2013, ESPN ran a &quot;Battle of the Uniforms&quot; contest between all 30 Major League clubs. Despite using a ranking system that had the Orioles as a #13 seed, the Birds beat the #1 seed Cardinals in the championship round.

=== Caps ===
The Orioles&#x27; cap design have alternated between the team&#x27;s iconic &quot;cartoon bird&quot; logo and the full-bodied bird logo. Initially, the caps had the full-bodied bird logo between 1954 and 1965, alternating between an all-black cap and an orange-brimmed black cap. They also wore a black cap with an orange block-letter &quot;B&quot; for part of the 1963 season. The &quot;cartoon bird&quot; was first used in 1966, and with minor tweaks, was prominently featured on the team&#x27;s caps until 1988. Initially, the Orioles kept the orange-brimmed black cap with the &quot;cartoon bird&quot; but switched to a white-paneled black cap with orange brim in 1975. Also that same year, they wore orange-paneled black caps to pair with the orange alternates, but these lasted only two seasons.

In 1989, the full-bodied bird logo returned along with the all-black cap, with a few tweaks along the way. Initially the cap was used regardless of home or road games, but in 2002 the caps were worn only on the road until 2008. An orange-brimmed variety was also introduced in 1995. Initially exclusive to the team&#x27;s black uniforms, this style became the home cap in 2002 and became the team&#x27;s regular cap (home or away) from 2009 to 2011.

In 2012, the Orioles brought back a modernized version of the &quot;cartoon bird&quot; along with the white-paneled and orange-brimmed black cap for home games and the orange-brimmed black cap for road games.

=== Alternate Uniforms ===
An alternate uniform is black with the word &quot;Orioles&quot; written across the chest. They first wore black uniforms in the 1993 season and continue to do so since; the current style with the letters lacking additional trim was first used in 2000. The Orioles wear their black alternate jerseys for Friday night games with the alternate &quot;O&#x27;s&quot; cap (first introduced in 2005), whether at home or on the road; the regular batting helmet is still used with this uniform. In 2017, the Orioles began to use their batting practice caps for select games with the black uniforms. The aforementioned caps resemble their regular road caps save for the black bill. Occasionally, the Orioles would also wear the black alternates on other days of the week, often pairing them with the home or road &quot;cartoon bird&quot; caps. After the &quot;City Connect&quot; uniforms became the team&#x27;s Friday home uniform (see below), the black alternates were only used on Friday road games and on home games depending on the preference of the starting pitcher.

The Orioles also wore orange alternate uniforms at various points in their history. The orange alternates were first used in the 1971 season and were paired with orange pants, but these lasted only two seasons. The second orange uniform, which was a pullover style, was worn from 1975 to 1987, but were not worn at all in the 1983, 1985 and 1986 seasons. A third orange uniform was used from 1988 to 1992, returning to the button-down style. In 2012, the Orioles brought back the orange uniforms as a second alternate uniform; the team currently wears them on Saturdays at home or on the road, though they&#x27;ve also worn them on other days of the week either due to pitcher&#x27;s preference or a previously postponed contest. For 2025, the Orioles brought back the all-orange alternate for select games, while keeping the orange uniform/white pants option for a few other games.

In 2023, the Orioles introduced a City Connect uniform, inspired by the art and culture of Baltimore and its neighborhoods. The uniform is mostly black base from the jersey to pants. Across the chest, it features the city name &quot;BALTIMORE&quot; in white lettering, and on the collar and sleeves features a small batch of colors and shapes, representing the neighborhoods of Baltimore. The cap, which is also on a black base, features an italic white &quot;B&quot;. In 2024, the City Connect uniform was worn with the home white pants for select games.

=== Uniform Advertisements ===
The Orioles announced its first-ever jersey sponsorship deal with T. Rowe Price on June 10, 2024. A circular dark blue, aqua and white sleeve patch with the investment management firm&#x27;s bighorn sheep logo debuted in a home game against the Atlanta Braves the following night on June 11.

==Radio and television coverage==
===Radio===
In Baltimore, Orioles radio broadcasts can be heard on WBAL-AM and WIYY, both owned by Hearst Television. Geoff Arnold, Melanie Newman, Brett Hollander, Scott Garceau and Kevin Brown alternate as play-by-play announcers. WBAL feeds the games to a network of 36 stations, covering Washington, D.C., and all or portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina.

This is WBAL&#x27;s fourth stint as the Orioles flagship. WBAL has carried Orioles games for most of the team&#x27;s time in Baltimore. Prior to WBAL and WIYY, Orioles games were broadcast locally on WJZ-FM from 2015 to 2021. WJZ had earlier carried broadcasts from 2007 to 2010.

Six former Orioles franchise radio announcers have received the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Ford C. Frick Award for excellence in broadcasting: Chuck Thompson (who was also the voice of the old NFL Baltimore Colts); Jon Miller (now with the San Francisco Giants); Ernie Harwell, Herb Carneal; Bob Murphy and Harry Caray (as a St. Louis Browns announcer in the 1940s).

Other former Baltimore announcers include Josh Lewin (currently with New York Mets), Bill O&#x27;Donnell, Tom Marr, Scott Garceau (returned in 2020 season), Mel Proctor, Michael Reghi, former major league catcher Buck Martinez (now Toronto Blue Jays play-by-play), Joe Angel and former Oriole players including Brooks Robinson, pitcher Mike Flanagan and outfielder John Lowenstein. In 1991, the Orioles experimented with longtime TV writer/producer Ken Levine as a play-by-play broadcaster. Levine was best noted for his work on TV shows such as &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, but lasted only one season in the Orioles broadcast booth.

===Television===
MASN, co-owned by the Orioles and the Washington Nationals, is the team&#x27;s exclusive television broadcaster. MASN airs almost the entire slate of regular season games. Some exceptions include Saturday games on either Fox (via its Baltimore affiliate, WBFF) or Fox Sports 1, or &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; on ESPN. Many MASN telecasts in conflict with Nationals&#x27; game telecasts air on an alternate MASN2 feed.

Veteran sportscaster Gary Thorne served as lead television announcer from 2007 to 2019, with Jim Hunter as his backup along with Hall of Fame member and former Orioles pitcher Jim Palmer and former Oriole infielder Mike Bordick as color analysts, who almost always work separately. In 2020, Thorne and Palmer were removed from the television booth due to COVID-19 concerns and replaced with Scott Garceau. In 2021, MASN let go Thorne, Hunter, analysts Mike Bordick and Rick Dempsey, and studio host Tom Davis, and added Ben McDonald as a secondary analyst. Starting in 2022, Kevin Brown became the primary TV play-by-play announcer, with Garceau, Arnold or Newman the backups.

The Orioles severed their ties with Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic (now NBC Sports Washington) at the end of the 2006 season in favor of MASN, a joint venture with the Washington Nationals. It had been the Orioles&#x27; cable partner since 1984, when it was known as Home Team Sports. The Orioles and the Washington Nationals have been in a dispute since the early 2010s, MASN is owned by both teams with the Orioles holding an 80% stake. The dispute which is ongoing as of October 2020 contends that the Nationals deserves a greater fee from MASN due to the team&#x27;s recent success and market growth. When fees paid to each team were first negotiated, both teams were paid the same fees.

WJZ-TV was the Orioles&#x27; broadcast TV home, completing its latest stint from 1994 through 2017. Since MASN acquired rights in 2007, its coverage was simulcast on WJZ-TV under the branding &quot;MASN on WJZ 13&quot;. MASN elected not to syndicate any Orioles or Washington Nationals games to broadcast television for the 2018 season, marking the first time since the Orioles&#x27; arrival that their games are not on local broadcast television.

Previously, WJZ-TV carried the team from their arrival in Baltimore in 1954 through 1978. In the first four seasons, WJZ-TV shared coverage with Baltimore&#x27;s other two stations, WMAR-TV and WBAL-TV. The games moved to WMAR from 1979 through 1993 before returning to WJZ-TV. From 1994 to 2009, some Orioles games aired on WNUV.

==Musical traditions==
===&quot;O!&quot;===

Since its introduction at games by the &quot;Roar from 34&quot;, led by Wild Bill Hagy and others, in the late 1970s, it has been a tradition at Orioles games for fans to yell out the &quot;Oh&quot; in the line &quot;Oh, say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave&quot; in &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; has special meaning to Baltimore historically, as it was written during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812 by Francis Scott Key, a Baltimorean.

The tradition is often carried out at other sporting events, both professional and amateur, and even sometimes at non-sporting events where the anthem is played, throughout the Baltimore/Washington area and beyond. Fans in Norfolk, Virginia, chanted &quot;O!&quot; even before the Tides became an Orioles affiliate. The practice caught some attention in the spring of 2005, when fans performed the &quot;O!&quot; cry at Washington Nationals games at RFK Stadium. The &quot;O!&quot; chant is also common at sporting events for the various Maryland Terrapins teams at the University of Maryland, College Park. At Cal Ripken Jr.&#x27;s induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the crowd, composed mostly of Orioles fans, carried out the &quot;O!&quot; tradition during Tony Gwynn&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. Additionally, a faint but audible &quot;O!&quot; could be heard on the television broadcast of Barack Obama&#x27;s pre-inaugural visit to Baltimore as the national anthem played before his entrance. A resounding &quot;O!&quot; bellowed from the nearly 30,000 Ravens fans who attended the November 21, 2010, away game at the Carolina Panthers&#x27; Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. A similar loud &quot;O!&quot; was heard from fans attending Super Bowl XLVII between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers. The &quot;O!&quot; chant was also heard during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when Baltimore native Michael Phelps received his gold medal for the freestyle on August 9, 2016.

In recent years, when the Orioles host the Toronto Blue Jays, fans have begun to shout out the multiple instances of the word &quot;O&quot; in &quot;O Canada&quot;. Washington Capitals fans will do the same when they play one of the NHL&#x27;s Canadian teams.

===&quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot;===

It has been an Orioles tradition since 1975 to play John Denver&#x27;s &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch.

In the edition of July 5, 2007, of Baltimore&#x27;s weekly sports publication &quot;Press Box&quot;, an article by Mike Gibbons covered the apocryphal details of how this tradition came to be. During &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot;, Charlie Zill, then an usher, would put on overalls, a straw hat, and false teeth and dance around the club level section (244) that he tended to. He also has an orange violin that spins for the fiddle solos. He went by the name Zillbilly and had done the skit from the 1999 season until shortly before he died in early 2013. Of course, that does nothing to explain why the Orioles&#x27; Audio staff began playing the song during every game&#x27;s seventh inning stretch beginning in August 1975.

In reality, the song was tremendously successful nationwide, topping the Billboard Top 100 for one week in 1975, and was played in stadiums across the country. The Orioles were chasing the Red Sox for the American League East Division title and incorporated numerous &quot;good luck charms.&quot; After an inspiring comeback win, Oriole staff began playing this song at the seventh inning stretch of every home game as one of the good-luck charms, beginning in August.

During a nationally televised game on September 20, 1997, Denver himself danced to the song atop the Orioles&#x27; dugout, one of his final public appearances before dying in a plane crash three weeks later.

===&quot;Orioles Magic&quot; and other songs===

Songs from notable games in the team&#x27;s history include &quot;One Moment in Time&quot; for Cal Ripken&#x27;s record-breaking game in 1995, as well as the theme from &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot; by Faith Hill, during his final game in 2001. The theme from &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; was played at the last game at Memorial Stadium in 1991, and the song &quot;Magic to Do&quot; from the stage musical &quot;Pippin&quot; was used that season to commemorate &quot;Orioles Magic&quot; on 33rd Street. During the Orioles&#x27; heyday in the 1970s, a club song, appropriately titled &quot;Orioles Magic (Feel It Happen)&quot;, was composed by Walt Woodward, and played when the team ran out until Opening Day of 2008. Since then, the song (a favorite among all fans, who appreciated its references to Wild Bill Hagy and Earl Weaver) is played (along with a video featuring several Orioles stars performing the song) only after wins. In the 2010s, &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; was often played as a hype song while the fans chant the signature bass riff as a rally cry during key moments of a game or after a walk-off hit. In the 2023 season, closer Felix Bautista would come out of the bullpen to the ominous whistle of &quot;The Wire&quot; character Omar Little.

===The First Army Band===

During the Orioles&#x27; final homestand of the season, it is a tradition to display a replica of the 15-star, 15-stripe American flag at Camden Yards. Prior to 1992, the 15-star, 15-stripe flag flew from Memorial Stadium&#x27;s center-field flagpole in place of the 50-star, 13-stripe flag during the final homestand. Since the move to Camden Yards, the former flag has been displayed on the batters&#x27; eye. During the Orioles&#x27; final home game of the season, The United States Army Field Band from Fort Meade performs the National Anthem prior to the start of the game. The Band has also played the National Anthem at the finales of three World Series in which the Orioles played: 1970, 1971 and 1979. They are introduced as the &quot;First Army Band&quot; during the pregame ceremonies.

==PA announcer==

For 23 years, Rex Barney was the PA announcer for the Orioles. His voice became a fixture of both Memorial Stadium and Camden Yards, and his expression &quot;Give that fan a contract&quot;, uttered whenever a fan caught a foul ball, was one of his trademarksthe other being his distinct &quot;Thank Yooooou...&quot; following every announcement. (He was also known on occasion to say &quot;Give that fan an error&quot; after a dropped foul ball.) Barney died on August 12, 1997, and in his honor that night&#x27;s game at Camden Yards against the Oakland Athletics was held without a public–address announcer.

Barney was replaced as Camden Yards&#x27; PA Announcer by Dave McGowan, who held the position from 1998 to 2011, after Chris Ely finished out the 1997 season. 

Lifelong Orioles fan and former MLB Fan Cave resident Ryan Wagner soon took over as the PA announcer. He was chosen out of a field of more than 670 applicants in the 2011–12 offseason. He held the job from 2012 to 2020. He was dismissed just hours before the team&#x27;s 2021 home opener, reportedly because of his conduct on Twitter.

Adrienne Roberson, at the time the public address announcer for the Bowie Baysox and Wagner&#x27;s primary substitute, has been the team&#x27;s announcer from 2021 onward. She became the second woman to be named an MLB team&#x27;s primary PA announcer, following Renel Brooks-Moon of the San Francisco Giants.

==Postseason appearances==

Of the eight original American League teams, the Orioles were the last of the eight to win the World Series, doing so in 1966 with its four–game sweep of the heavily favored Los Angeles Dodgers. When the Orioles were the St. Louis Browns, they played in only one World Series, the 1944 matchup against their Sportsman&#x27;s Park tenants, the Cardinals. The Orioles won the first-ever American League Championship Series in 1969, and in 2012 the Orioles beat the Texas Rangers in the inaugural American League Wild Card game, where for the first time two Wild Card teams faced each other during postseason play.


==Baseball Hall of Famers==
 
 

===Ford C. Frick Award (broadcasters only)===
===Retired numbers===

The Orioles will retire a number only when a player has been inducted into the Hall of Fame with Cal Ripken Jr. being the only exception. However, the Orioles have placed moratoriums on other former Orioles&#x27; numbers following their deaths (see note below). To date, the Orioles have retired the following numbers:

Note: Elrod Hendricks&#x27; number 44 has not officially been retired, but a moratorium has been placed on it and it has not been issued by the team since his death. Cal Ripken Sr.&#x27;s number 7 and Mike Flanagan&#x27;s number 46 had similar moratoriums until 2024 when they were worn by Jackson Holliday and Craig Kimbrel respectively.

†&quot;Jackie Robinson&#x27;s number 42 is retired throughout Major League Baseball&quot;

==Rivalries==
===Washington Nationals===

The Orioles have a minor regional rivalry with the nearby Washington Nationals nicknamed the Beltway Series or Battle of the Beltways. Baltimore currently leads the series with a 55–39 record over the Nationals. They have divisional rivals within the American League East, predominately with the New York Yankees in the past and in more recent years with the Toronto Blue Jays.

<text>The Bastarnae, Bastarni or Basternae, also known as the Peuci or Peucini, were an ancient people who are known from Greek and Roman records to have inhabited areas north and east of the Carpathian Mountains between about 300 BC and about 300 AD, stretching in an ark from the sources of the Vistula in present day Poland and Slovakia, to the Lower Danube, and including all or most of present day Moldava. The Peucini were sometimes described as a subtribe, who settled the Peuke Island in the Danube Delta, but apparently due to their importance their name was sometimes used for the Bastarnae as a whole. Near the sources of the Vistula another part of the Bastarnae were the Sidones, while the Atmoni, another tribe of the Bastarnae are only mentioned in one listing by Strabo.

The earliest Graeco-Roman historians to refer to the Bastarnae imply that they were culturally Celtic. Also consistent with connections to the cultures to their west, later Roman-era sources state directly that they spoke Germanic languages, and could be considered Germanic peoples. In contrast, like other peoples who lived in this geographical region, Graeco-Roman writers also sometimes referred to the Bastarnae as a &quot;Scythian&quot; or &quot;Sarmatian&quot; people, but this was a reference to their location, and customs, rather than a linguistic category. Although largely sedentary, at least one Roman writer, Tacitus, stated that the Bastarnae had adopted some Sarmatian customs. So far, no archaeological sites have been conclusively attributed to the Bastarnae. The archaeological horizon most often associated by scholars with the Bastarnae is the Poieneşti-Lucașeuca culture.

From the first records which mention them, the Bastarnae were active in the region of the Danube estuary on the Black Sea coast. The Bastarnae first came into conflict with the Romans during the first century BC when, in alliance with Dacians and Sarmatians, they unsuccessfully resisted Roman expansion into Moesia and Pannonia, south of the Danube. Later, they appear to have maintained friendly relations with the Roman Empire during the first two centuries AD. This changed around 180 AD, when the Bastarnae are recorded as participants in an invasion of Roman territory, once again in alliance with Sarmatians and Dacians. In the mid-3rd century AD, the Bastarnae were part of a Gothic-led grand coalition of lower Danube tribes that repeatedly invaded the Balkan provinces of the Roman Empire.

Many Bastarnae were resettled within the Roman Empire in the late third century.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the tribal name is uncertain. It is not even clear whether it was an exonym (a name ascribed to them by outsiders) or an endonym (a name by which the Bastarnae described themselves). A related question is whether the groups denoted &quot;Bastarnae&quot; by the Romans considered themselves a distinct ethnic group at all (endonym) or whether it was a generic exonym used by the Greco-Romans to denote a disparate group of tribes of the Carpathian region that could not be classified as Dacians or Sarmatians.

One possible derivation is from the proto-Germanic word &quot;*bastjan&quot; (from Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;bʰas-&quot;), meaning &quot;binding&quot; or &quot;tie&quot;. In this case, &quot;Bastarnae&quot; may have had the original meaning of a coalition or &quot;bund&quot; of tribes.

It is possible that the Roman term &quot;basterna&quot;, denoting a type of wagon or litter, is derived from the name of this people (or, if it is an exonym, that the name of the people is derived from it) who were known, like many Germanic tribes, to travel with a wagon train for their families.

It has also been suggested that the name is linked with the Germanic word &quot;bastard&quot;, meaning illegitimate or mongrel, and this name is sometimes contrasted to proposed Germanic etymologies for the name of the Sciri who lived in the same general region. However, Roger Batty considers this Germanic derivation unlikely. If the name is an endonym, then this derivation is unlikely, as most endonyms have flattering meanings (e.g. &quot;brave&quot;, &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;noble&quot;).

Trubačev proposes a derivation from Old Persian, Avestan &quot;bast-&quot; &quot;bound, tied; slave&quot; (cf. Ossetic bættən &quot;bind&quot;, bast &quot;bound&quot;) and Iranian &quot;*arna-&quot; &quot;offspring&quot;, equating it with the &quot;δουλόσποροι&quot; &quot;slave Sporoi&quot; mentioned by Nonnus and Cosmas, where the Sporoi are the people Procopius mentions as the ancestors of the Slavs.

== Location ==

The earliest classical mentions of the Bastarnae locate them north of the Lower Danube, although they apparently made frequent crossings impacting upon the peoples living south of the Danube.

Strabo (about 20 AD) made several remarks about the location of the Bastarnae. In one place he described the lands beyond the Rhine and Danube as the home of the Galatian (Celtic) and the Germanic peoples, and beyond these (to the east) were the Bastarnae and their neighbours the Tyregetans &quot;and the River Borysthenes&quot; (Dnieper). However, in another similar passage he says only that &quot;most writers suspect&quot; the Bastarnae to be next beyond the Germanic Peoples, but he indicates that it is also possible that &quot;others lie in between, either the Iazyges, or the Roxolani, or certain other of the wagon-dwellers — it is not easy to say&quot;. In yet another similar passage he describes the Bastarnae as the most inland (northerly) of the peoples living between the Borysthenes (Dnieper) and the Ister (Lower Danube), and indicates that their neighbours the Tyregetans are closer to the Black Sea.

Strabo also mentioned their interactions with other peoples near the Danube, specifying that in his time, &quot;wagon-dwelling&quot; Scythians and Sarmatians, &quot;as well as the Bastarnian tribes, are mingled with the Thracians (more indeed with those outside the Ister [North of the Danube], but also with those inside). And mingled with them are also the Celtic tribes — the Boii, the Scordisci, and the Taurisci&quot;. He confirmed that historically &quot;the Scythians and Bastarnians and Sauromatians on the far side of the river [the Lower Danube] often prevail to the extent that they actually cross over to attack those whom they have already driven out, and some of them remain there, either in the islands or in Thrace&quot;. In particular, Near the outlets of the Ister River [Lower Danube] is a great island called Peuce; and when the Bastarnians took possession of it they received the appellation of Peucini.&quot;

In one passage Pliny the Elder located the Bastarnae &quot;and other Germanic peoples&quot; in the lands beyond the Iazyges and Dacians (&quot;aversa Basternae tenent aliique inde Germani&quot;). In another he describes &quot;the Peucini, the Basternae&quot;, as neighbours of the Dacians. 

In the second century AD, the texts attached to Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; say that &quot;above Dacia are the Peucini and the Basternae&quot;; &quot;between the Peucini and the Basternae are the Carpiani&quot;; &quot;between the Basternae and the Rhoxolani&quot; who he places on the Black Sea coast, &quot;are the Chuni&quot; (otherwise unknown); and &quot;below the Basternae near Dacia are the Tigri and below these are the Tyrangitae&quot; whose names are linked to the Tyras or Dniester river. Possibly relevant, he also mentioned a mountainous region called the &quot;Peuca&quot; mountains south of the Costoboci and Transmontani. The Sidones, named as one part of the Bastarnae by Strabo, are described by Ptolemy as one of the peoples east of the Vistula, although the location is not clear. It thus appears that the Bastarnae were settled in a vast arc stretching around the northern and eastern flanks of the Carpathians from western Ukraine to the Danube Delta.

The Peutinger Map (produced ca. 400 AD, but including material from as early as the first century) shows the Bastarnae (mis-spelt &quot;Blastarni&quot;) north of the Carpathian mountains and appears to name the Galician Carpathians as the &quot;Alpes Bastarnicae&quot;.

Because of their apparent cultural and linguistic connections to the west, the Bastarnae are generally believed to have moved originally from that direction, but this remains uncertain. Babeş and Shchukin argue in favour of an origin in eastern Pomerania on the Baltic coast of today&#x27;s north-west Poland, on the grounds of correspondences in archaeological material, e.g. a Pomeranian-style fibula found in a Poieneşti site in Moldavia, although Batty considers the evidence insufficient. Babeş identifies the Sidoni, a branch of the Bastarnae which Strabo mentioned with the &quot;Sidini&quot; located by Ptolemy in Pomerania.

Batty argues that Greco-Roman sources of the first century AD locate the Bastarnae homeland on the northern side of the Northern Carpathian mountain range, encompassing south-east Poland and south-west Ukraine (i.e. the region traditionally known as Galicia).

== Ethno-linguistic affiliation ==
Scholars hold divergent theories about the ethnicity of the Bastarnae. One view, implied by some of the earliest reports, is that they spoke a Celtic language. The only explicit description of their language, was a much later remark by Tacitus, who said they spoke a language like the Germanic peoples. However others hold that they were Scythian/Germanic, or mixed Germanic/Sarmatian. A fringe theory is that they were Proto-Slavic. Shchukin argues that the ethnicity of the Bastarnae was unique and rather than trying to label them as Celtic, Germanic or Sarmatian, it should be accepted that the &quot;Basternae were the Basternae&quot;. Batty argues that assigning an &quot;ethnicity&quot; to the Bastarnae is meaningless; as in the context of the Iron Age Pontic-Danubian region, with its multiple overlapping peoples and languages, ethnicity was a very fluid concept, which changed rapidly and frequently, according to socio-political vicissitudes. That was especially true of the Bastarnae, who are attested over a relatively-vast area. The Bastarnae maintained a separate name until ca. 300 AD, probably implying retention of their distinctive ethno-linguistic heritage up to that time.

=== Celtic ===
Polybius (200–118 BC) writing about the time of Perseus of Macedon (d. 166 BCE) explained how the Dardanians sought help from the Romans against the Bastarnae, who were allied with the Macedonian and Celtic (Galatian) enemies of Rome, which can be taken as implying that they were not Galatian. He described them as numerous, physically large, and valorous warriors.

On the other hand a much later report of these events by Livy (64 BC – 17 AD), writing about 10 AD, is sometimes understood to imply that the Bastarnae spoke a Celtic language (or a related language) because when comparing them to the Scordisci, a major Galatian tribe of Pannonia, it specifies that the Bastarnae were &quot;neither in speech nor habits were they dissimilar&quot;. The Scordisci are described as Celtic by Strabo, although he adds that they had mingled with Illyrians and Thracians). 

Much later still, the Greek historian Plutarch (about 46-120 AD), also talking the time of Perseus of Macedon, went further, writing that the Roman consul Hostilius &quot;secretly stirred up the Gauls settled along the Danube, who are called Basternae&quot;.

Another reason to consider the Bastarnae as Celtic is that the regions they are documented to have occupied (the northern and eastern slopes of the Carpathians) overlapped to a great extent with the locations of Celtic tribes attested in the northern Carpathians. (The modern name of this region, Galicia, is generally regarded as having a later origin, in either a Slavic or Turkic language. However, some scholars have instead suggested that the name Galicia may derive from its former Celtic inhabitants the Taurisci, Osi, Cotini and Anartes of Slovakia and northern Romania and the Britogalli of the Danube Delta region.) In addition, archaeological cultures which some scholars have linked to the Bastarnae (Poieneşti-Lukashevka and Zarubintsy) display pronounced Celtic affinities. Finally, the arrival of the Bastarnae in the Pontic-Danubian region, which can be dated to 233–216 BC according to two ancient sources, coincides with the latter phase of Celtic migration into the region (400–200 BC).

In addition, inscription AE (1905) 14, recording a campaign on the Hungarian Plain by the Augustan-era general Marcus Vinucius (10 BC or 8 BC), also appears to distinguish the Bastarnae from neighbouring Celtic tribes: &quot;Marcus Vinucius... governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the Cotini, Osi...[missing tribal name] and Anartii to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome.&quot;

The three names of Bastarnae leaders found in ancient sources are of Celtic origin: Cotto, Clondicus and Teutagonus.

=== Germanic ===
Three Greco-Roman geographers of the first century AD associated the Bastarnae and Peucini with the Germanic peoples, and one source, Tacitus, specifies that they spoke a language like the Germanic peoples. The Greek geographer Strabo (64 BC – 24 AD) writing c. 5–20 AD, made several remarks about the location of the Bastarnae in his own time. In one passage he says that their country borders on that of the Tyregetans towards the Black Sea and Danube, and Germanic peoples to the west, and that they &quot;one might say&quot;, were of &quot;Germanic stock&quot;. 

The Roman geographer Pliny the Elder (c. 77 AD), classified the Bastarnae or Peucini as being one of the five main subdivisions of Germanic peoples, the other subdivisions as the three West Germanic groups, the &quot;Inguaeones&quot;, &quot;Istuaeones&quot; and &quot;Hermiones&quot;, and the East Germanic &quot;Vandili&quot;.

Notably, the Roman historian Tacitus (56–120 AD), writing about 100 AD, described the Bastarnae as probably being a Germanic people, but with substantial Sarmatian cultural influence and intermarriage:
:As to the tribes of the Peucini, Veneti, and Fenni I am in doubt whether I should class them with the Germans or the Sarmatæ, although indeed the Peucini called by some Bastarnæ, are like Germans in their language, mode of life, and in the permanence of their settlements. They all live in filth and sloth, and by the intermarriages of the chiefs they are becoming in some degree debased into a resemblance to the Sarmatæ.

=== Scytho-Sarmatian ===
Strabo includes the Roxolani, generally considered by scholars to have been a Sarmatian tribe, in a list of Bastarnae subgroups. However, this may simply be an error due to the close proximity of the two peoples north of the Danube Delta. 

In the third century, the Greek historian Dio Cassius (155–235 AD) stated that the &quot;Bastarnae are properly classed as Scythians&quot; and &quot;members of the Scythian race&quot;. 
:&quot;During the same period in which these events occurred Marcus Crassus was sent into Macedonia and Greece and carried on war with the Dacians and Bastarnae. I have already stated who the former were and why they had become hostile; the Bastarnae, on the other hand, who are properly classed as Scythians, had at this time crossed the Ister and subdued the part of Moesia opposite them, and afterwards subdued the Triballi who adjoin this district and the Dardani who inhabit the Triballian country.&quot;

Likewise, the sixth-century historian Zosismus (490s–510 AD), reporting events around 280 AD, refers to &quot;the Bastarnae, a Scythian people&quot;.

However, late Greco-Roman chroniclers used the term &quot;Scythian&quot; without regard to language. The earliest Scythians were steppe nomads associated with Iranic languages, as were their successors the Sarmatians, who were also called Scythians, while classical authors such as Zosimus also routinely refers to the Goths, who were undoubtedly Germanic-speakers, as &quot;Scythians&quot;. On the other hand it is likely that Bastarnae were influenced the surrounding Sarmatians, as reflected in Tacitus&#x27; comment that &quot;mixed marriages&quot; debasing them to appear more like the Sarmatians.

== Material culture ==

According to Malcolm Todd, traditional archaeology has not been able to construct a typology of Bastarnae material culture, and thus to ascribe particular archaeological sites to the Bastarnae. A complicating factor is that the regions where Bastarnae are attested contained a patchwork of peoples and cultures (Sarmatians, Scythians, Dacians, Thracians, Celts, Germans and others), some sedentary, some nomadic. In any event, post-1960s archaeological theory has questioned the validity of equating material &quot;cultures&quot;, as defined by archaeologists, with distinct ethnic groups. In this view, it is impossible to attribute a &quot;culture&quot; to a particular ethnic group: it is likely that the material cultures discerned in the region belonged to several, if not all, of the groups inhabiting it. These cultures probably represent relatively large-scale socio-economic interactions between disparate communities of the broad region, possibly including mutually antagonistic groups.

It is not even certain whether the Bastarnae were sedentary, nomadic or semi-nomadic. Tacitus&#x27; statement that they were &quot;German in their way of life and types of dwelling&quot; implies a sedentary bias, but their close relations with the Sarmatians, who were nomadic, may indicate a more nomadic lifestyle for some Bastarnae, as does their attested wide geographical range. If the Bastarnae were nomadic, then the sedentary &quot;cultures&quot; identified by archaeologists in their &quot;lebensraum&quot; would not represent them. Nomadic peoples generally leave scant traces, due to the impermanent materials and foundations used in the construction of their dwellings.

Scholars have identified two closely related sedentary &quot;cultures&quot; as possible candidates to represent the Bastarnae (among other peoples) as their locations broadly correspond to where ancient sources placed the Basternae: the Zarubintsy culture lying in the forest-steppe zone in northern Ukraine and southern Belarus, and the Poieneşti-Lukashevka culture (Lucăşeuca) in northern Moldavia. These cultures were characterised by agriculture, documented by numerous finds of sickles. Dwellings were either of surface or semi-subterranean types, with posts supporting the walls, a hearth in the middle and large conical pits located nearby. Some sites were defended by ditches and banks, structures thought to have been built to defend against nomadic tribes from the steppe. Inhabitants practiced cremation. Cremated remains were either placed in large, hand-made ceramic urns, or were placed in a large pit and surrounded by food and ornaments such as spiral bracelets and Middle to Late La Tène-type &quot;fibulae&quot; (attesting the continuing strength of Celtic influence in this region).

A major problem with associating the Poieneşti-Lukashevka and Zarubintsy cultures with the Bastarnae is that both cultures had disappeared by the early first century AD, while the Bastarnae continue to be attested in those regions throughout the Roman Principate. Another issue is that the Poieneşti-Lukashevka culture has also been attributed to the Costoboci, a people considered ethnically Dacian by mainstream scholarship, who inhabited northern Moldavia, according to Ptolemy (ca. 140 AD). Indeed, Mircea Babeş and Silvia Theodor, the two Romanian archaeologists who identified Lukashevka as Bastarnic, nevertheless insisted that the majority of the population in the Lukashevka sphere (in northern Moldavia) was &quot;Geto-Dacian&quot;. A further problem is that neither of these cultures were present in the Danube Delta region, where a major concentration of Bastarnae are attested by the ancient sources.

Starting in about 200 AD, the Chernyakhov culture became established in the modern-day western Ukraine and Moldova region inhabited by the Bastarnae. The culture is characterised by a high degree of sophistication in the production of metal and ceramic artefacts, as well as of uniformity over a vast area. Although this culture has conventionally been identified with the migration of the Gothic &quot;ethnos&quot; into the region from the northwest, Todd argues that its most important origin is Scytho-Sarmatian. Although the Goths certainly contributed to it, so probably did other peoples of the region such as the Dacians, proto-Slavs, Carpi and possibly the Bastarnae.

== Relations with Rome ==

=== Roman Republican era (to 30 BC) ===

==== Allies of Philip of Macedon (179–8 BC) ====
The Bastarnae first appear in the historical record in 179 BC, when they crossed the Danube in a massive force. They did so at the invitation of their long-time ally, King Philip V of Macedon, a direct descendant of Antigonus, one of the Diadochi, the generals of Alexander the Great who had shared his empire after his death in 323 BC. The Macedonian king had suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Romans in the Second Macedonian War (200–197 BC), which had reduced him from a powerful Hellenistic monarch to the status of a petty client-king with a much-reduced territory and a tiny army. After nearly 20 years of slavish adherence to the Roman Senate&#x27;s dictats, Philip had been goaded by the incessant and devastating raiding of the Dardani, a warlike Illyrian tribe on his northern border, which his treaty-limited army was too small to counter effectively. Counting on the Bastarnae, with whom he had forged friendly relations, he plotted a strategy to deal with the Dardani and then to regain his lost territories in Greece and his political independence. First, he would unleash the Bastarnae against the Dardani. After the latter had been crushed, Philip planned to settle Bastarnae families in Dardania (southern Kosovo/Skopje region) to ensure that the region was permanently subdued. In a second phase, Philip aimed to launch the Bastarnae on an invasion of Italy via the Adriatic coast. Although he was aware that the Bastarnae were likely to be defeated, Philip hoped that the Romans would be distracted long enough to allow him to reoccupy his former possessions in Greece.

However, Philip, now 60 years of age, died before the Bastarnae could arrive. The Bastarnae host was still &quot;en route&quot; through Thrace, where it became embroiled in hostilities with the locals, who had not provided them with sufficient food at affordable prices as they marched through. Probably in the vicinity of Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria), the Bastarnae broke out of their marching columns and pillaged the land far and wide. The terrified local Thracians took refuge with their families and animal herds on the slopes of &quot;Mons Donuca&quot; (Mount Musala), the highest mountain in Thrace. A large force of Bastarnae chased them up the mountain, but were driven back and scattered by a massive hailstorm. Then the Thracians ambushed them, turning their descent into a panic-stricken rout. Back at their wagon fort in the plain, around half of the demoralised Bastarnae decided to return home, leaving c. 30,000 to press on to Macedonia.

Philip&#x27;s son and successor Perseus, while protesting his loyalty to Rome, deployed his Bastarnae guests in winter quarters in a valley in Dardania, presumably as a prelude to a campaign against the Dardani the following summer. However, in the depths of winter their camp was attacked by the Dardani. The Bastarnae easily beat off the attackers, chased them back to their chief town and besieged them, but they were surprised in the rear by a second force of Dardani, which had approached their camp stealthily by mountain paths, and proceeded to storm and ransack it. Having lost their entire baggage and supplies, the Bastarnae were obliged to withdraw from Dardania and to return home. Most perished as they crossed the frozen Danube on foot, only for the ice to give way. Despite the failure of Philip&#x27;s Bastarnae strategy, the suspicion aroused by these events in the Roman Senate, which had been warned by the Dardani of the Bastarnae invasion, ensured the demise of Macedonia as an independent state. Rome declared war on Perseus in 171 BC and after the Macedonian army was crushed at the Battle of Pydna (168 BC), Macedonia was split up into four Roman puppet-cantons (167 BC). Twenty-one years later, these were in turn abolished and annexed to the Roman Republic as the province of Macedonia (146 BC).

==== Allies of Getan high king Burebista (62 BC) ====
The Bastarnae first came into direct conflict with Rome as a result of expansion into the lower Danube region by the proconsuls (governors) of Macedonia in 75–72 BC. Gaius Scribonius Curio (proconsul 75–73 BC) campaigned successfully against the Dardani and the Moesi, becoming the first Roman general to reach the Danube with his army. His successor, Marcus Licinius Lucullus (brother of the famous Lucius Lucullus), campaigned against the Thracian Bessi tribe and the Moesi, ravaging the whole of Moesia, the region between the Haemus (Balkan) mountain range and the Danube. In 72 BC, his troops occupied the Greek coastal cities of Scythia Minor (modern Dobruja region, Romania/Bulgaria), which had sided with Rome&#x27;s Hellenistic arch-enemy, King Mithridates VI of Pontus, in the Third Mithridatic War (73–63 BC).

The presence of Roman forces in the Danube Delta was seen as a major threat by all the neighbouring transdanubian peoples: the Peucini Bastarnae, the Sarmatians and, most importantly, by Burebista (ruled 82–44 BC), king of the Getae. The Getae occupied the region today called Wallachia as well as Scythia Minor and were either a Dacian- or Thracian- speaking people. Burebista had unified the Getae tribes into a single kingdom, for which the Greek cities were vital trade outlets. In addition, he had established his hegemony over neighbouring Sarmatian and Bastarnae tribes. At its peak, the Getae kingdom reportedly was able to muster 200,000 warriors. Burebista led his transdanubian coalition in a struggle against Roman encroachment, conducting many raids against Roman allies in Moesia and Thrace, penetrating as far as Macedonia and Illyria.

The coalition&#x27;s main chance came in 62 BC, when the Greek cities rebelled against Roman rule. In 61 BC, the notoriously oppressive and militarily incompetent proconsul of Macedonia, Gaius Antonius, nicknamed &quot;Hybrida&quot; (&quot;The Monster&quot;), an uncle of the famous Mark Antony, led an army against the Greek cities. As his army approached Histria, Antonius detached his entire mounted force from the marching column and led it away on a lengthy excursion, leaving his infantry without cavalry cover, a tactic he had already used with disastrous results against the Dardani. Dio implies that he did so out of cowardice, in order to avoid the imminent clash with the opposition, but it is more likely that he was pursuing a large enemy cavalry force, probably Sarmatians. A Bastarnae host, which had crossed the Danube to assist the Histrians, promptly attacked, surrounded and massacred the Roman infantry, capturing several of their &quot;vexilla&quot; (military standards). This battle resulted in the collapse of the Roman position on the lower Danube. Burebista apparently annexed the Greek cities (55–48 BC). At the same time, the subjugated &quot;allied&quot; tribes of Moesia and Thrace evidently repudiated their treaties with Rome, as they had to be reconquered by Augustus in 29–8 BC (see below).

In 44 BC, Roman dictator-for-life Julius Caesar planned to lead a major campaign to crush Burebista and his allies once and for all, but he was assassinated before it could start. However, the campaign was made redundant by Burebista&#x27;s overthrow and death in the same year, after which his Getae empire fragmented into four, later five, independent petty kingdoms. These were militarily far weaker, as Strabo assessed their combined military potential at just 40,000 armed men, and were often involved in internecine warfare. The Geto-Dacians did not again become a threat to Roman hegemony in the lower Danube until the rise of Decebal 130 years later (86 AD).

=== Roman Principate (30 BC – 284 AD) ===

==== Augustan era (30 BC – 14 AD) ====
Once he had established himself as sole ruler of the Roman state in 30 BC, Caesar&#x27;s grand-nephew and adopted son Augustus inaugurated a strategy of advancing the empire&#x27;s south-eastern European border to the line of the Danube from the Alps, the Dinaric Alps and Macedonia. The primary objective was to increase strategic depth between the border and Italy and also to provide a major fluvial supply route between the Roman armies in the region.

On the lower Danube, which was given priority over the upper Danube, this required the annexation of Moesia. The Romans&#x27; target was thus the tribes which inhabited Moesia, namely (from west to east) the Triballi, Moesi and those Getae who dwelt south of the Danube. The Bastarnae were also a target because they had recently subjugated the Triballi, whose territory lay on the southern bank of the Danube between the tributary rivers &quot;Utus&quot; (Vit) and &quot;Ciabrus&quot; (Tsibritsa), with their chief town at Oescus (Gigen, Bulgaria). In addition, Augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of Gaius Antonius at Histria 32 years before and to recover the lost military standards. These were held in a powerful fortress called Genucla (Isaccea, near modern Tulcea, Romania, in the Danube Delta region), controlled by Zyraxes, the local Getan king. The man selected for the task was Marcus Licinius Crassus, grandson of Crassus the triumvir and an experienced general at 33 years of age, who was appointed proconsul of Macedonia in 29 BC.

The Bastarnae provided the &quot;casus belli&quot; by crossing the Haemus and attacking the Dentheletae, a Thracian tribe who were Roman allies. Crassus marched to the Dentheletae&#x27;s assistance, but the Bastarnae host hastily withdrew over the Haemus at his approach. Crassus followed them closely into Moesia but they would not be drawn into battle, withdrawing beyond the Tsibritsa. Crassus now turned his attention to the Moesi, his prime target. After a successful campaign which resulted in the submission of a substantial section of the Moesi, Crassus again sought out the Bastarnae. Discovering their location from some peace envoys they had sent to him, he lured them into battle near the Tsibritsa by a stratagem. Hiding his main body of troops in a wood, he stationed as bait a smaller vanguard in open ground before the wood. As expected, the Bastarnae attacked the vanguard in force, only to find themselves entangled in the full-scale pitched battle with the Romans that they had tried to avoid. The Bastarnae tried to retreat into the forest but were hampered by the wagon train carrying their women and children, as these could not move through the trees. Trapped into fighting to save their families, the Bastarnae were routed. Crassus personally killed their king, Deldo, in combat, a feat which qualified him for Rome&#x27;s highest military honour, &quot;spolia opima&quot;, but Augustus refused to award it on a technicality. Thousands of fleeing Bastarnae perished, many asphyxiated in nearby woods by encircling fires set by the Romans, others drowned trying to swim across the Danube. Nevertheless, a substantial force dug themselves into a powerful hillfort. Crassus laid siege to fort, but had to enlist the assistance of Rholes, a Getan petty king, to dislodge them, for which service Rholes was granted the title of &quot;socius et amicus populi Romani&quot; (&quot;ally and friend of the Roman people&quot;).

The following year (28 BC), Crassus marched on Genucla. Zyraxes escaped with his treasure and fled over the Danube into Scythia to seek aid from the Bastarnae. Before he was able to bring reinforcements, Genucla fell to a combined land and fluvial assault by the Romans. The strategic result of Crassus&#x27; campaigns was the permanent annexation of Moesia by Rome.

About a decade later, in 10 BC, the Bastarnae again clashed with Rome during Augustus&#x27; conquest of Pannonia (the &quot;bellum Pannonicum&quot; 14–9 BC). Inscription AE (1905) 14 records a campaign on the Hungarian Plain by the Augustan-era general Marcus Vinucius: Marcus Vinucius...[patronymic], Consul [in 19 BC]...[various official titles], governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the Cotini, Osi...[missing tribal name] and Anartii to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome. Most likely, the Bastarnae, in alliance with Dacians, were attempting to assist the hard-pressed Illyrian/Celtic tribes of Pannonia in their resistance to Rome.

==== First and second centuries ====
It appears that in the final years of Augustus&#x27; rule, the Bastarnae made their peace with Rome. The &quot;Res Gestae Divi Augusti&quot; (&quot;Acts of the divine Augustus&quot;, 14 AD), an inscription commissioned by Augustus to list his achievements, states that he received an embassy from the Bastarnae seeking a treaty of friendship. It appears that a treaty was concluded and apparently proved remarkably effective, as no hostilities with the Bastarnae are recorded in surviving ancient sources until c. 175, some 160 years after Augustus&#x27; inscription was carved. But surviving evidence for the history of this period is so thin that it cannot be excluded that the Bastarnae clashed with Rome during it. The Bastarnae participated in the Dacian Wars of Domitian (86–88) and Trajan (101–102 and 105–106), fighting on both wars on the Dacian side

In the late second century, the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; mentions that in the rule of Marcus Aurelius (161–180), an alliance of lower Danube tribes including the Bastarnae, the Sarmatian Roxolani and the Costoboci took advantage of the emperor&#x27;s difficulties on the upper Danube (the Marcomannic Wars) to invade Roman territory.

==== Third century ====
During the late second century, the main ethnic change in the northern Black Sea region was the immigration, from the Vistula valley in the North, of the Goths and accompanying Germanic tribes such as the Taifali and the Hasdingi, a branch of the Vandal people. This migration was part of a series of major population movements in the European &quot;barbaricum&quot; (the Roman term for regions outside their empire). The Goths appear to have established a loose political hegemony over the existing tribes in the region.

Under the leadership of the Goths, a series of major invasions of the Roman empire were launched by a grand coalition of lower Danubian tribes from c. 238 onwards. The participation of the Bastarnae in these is likely but largely unspecified, due to Zosimus&#x27; and other chroniclers&#x27; tendency to lump all these tribes under the general term &quot;Scythians&quot; – meaning all the inhabitants of Scythia, rather than the specific Iranic-speaking people called the Scythians. Thus, in 250–251, the Bastarnae were probably involved in the Gothic and Sarmatian invasions which culminated in the Roman defeat at the Battle of Abrittus and the slaying of Emperor Decius (251). This disaster was the start of the Third Century Crisis of the Roman Empire, a period of military and economic chaos. At this critical moment, the Roman army was crippled by the outbreak of a second smallpox pandemic, the plague of Cyprian (251–70). The effects are described by Zosimus as even worse than the earlier Antonine plague (166–180), which probably killed 15–30% of the empire&#x27;s inhabitants.

Taking advantage of Roman military disarray, a vast number of barbarian peoples overran much of the empire. The Sarmato-Gothic alliance of the lower Danube carried out major invasions of the Balkans region in 252, and in the periods 253–258 and 260–268. The Peucini Bastarnae are specifically mentioned in the 267/268 invasion, when the coalition built a fleet in the estuary of the river &quot;Tyras&quot; (Dniester). The Peucini Bastarnae would have been critical to this venture since, as coastal and delta dwellers, they would have had seafaring experience that the nomadic Sarmatians and Goths lacked. The barbarians sailed along the Black Sea coast to Tomis in Moesia Inferior, which they tried to take by assault without success. They then attacked the provincial capital Marcianopolis (Devnya, Bulgaria), also in vain. Sailing on through the Bosporus, the expedition laid siege to Thessalonica in Macedonia. Driven off by Roman forces, the coalition host moved overland into Thracia, where finally it was crushed by Emperor Claudius II (r. 268–270) at Naissus (269).

Claudius II was the first of a sequence of military emperors (the so-called &quot;Illyrian emperors&quot; from their main ethnic origin) who restored order in the empire in the late third century. These emperors followed a policy of large-scale resettlement within the empire of defeated barbarian tribes, granting them land in return for an obligation of military service much heavier than the usual conscription quota. The policy had the triple benefit, from the Roman point of view, of weakening the hostile tribe, repopulating the plague-ravaged frontier provinces (bringing their abandoned fields back into cultivation) and providing a pool of first-rate recruits for the army. It could also be popular with the barbarian prisoners, who were often delighted by the prospect of a land grant within the empire. In the fourth century, such communities were known as &quot;laeti&quot;.

The emperor Probus (r. 276–282) is recorded as resettling 100,000 Bastarnae in Moesia, in addition to other peoples, including Goths, Gepids and Vandals. The Bastarnae are reported to have honoured their oath of allegiance to the emperor, while the other resettled peoples mutinied while Probus was distracted by usurpation attempts and ravaged the Danubian provinces far and wide. A further massive transfer of Bastarnae was carried out by Emperor Diocletian (ruled 284–305) after he and his colleague Galerius defeated a coalition of Bastarnae and Carpi in 299.

=== Later Roman empire (305 onwards) ===

The remaining transdanubian Bastarnae disappear into historical obscurity in the late empire. Neither of the main ancient sources for this period, Ammianus Marcellinus and Zosimus, mention the Bastarnae in their accounts of the fourth century, possibly implying the loss of their separate identity, presumably assimilated by the regional hegemons, the Goths. Such assimilation would have been facilitated if, as is possible, the Bastarnae spoke an East Germanic language closely related to Gothic. If the Bastarnae remained an identifiable group, it is highly likely that they participated in the vast Gothic-led migration, driven by Hunnic pressure, that was admitted into Moesia by Emperor Valens in 376 and eventually defeated and killed Valens at Adrianople in 378. Although Ammianus refers to the migrants collectively as &quot;Goths&quot;, he states that, in addition, &quot;Taifali and other tribes&quot; were involved.

However, after a gap of 150 years, there is a final mention of Bastarnae in the mid-5th century. In 451, the Hunnic leader Attila invaded Gaul with a large army which was ultimately routed at the Battle of Châlons by a Roman-led coalition under the general Aetius. Attila&#x27;s host, according to Jordanes, included contingents from the &quot;innumerable tribes that had been brought under his sway&quot;. This included the Bastarnae, according to the Gallic nobleman Sidonius Apollinaris. However, E.A. Thompson argues that Sidonius&#x27; mention of Bastarnae at Chalons is probably false: his purpose was to write a panegyric and not a history, and Sidonius added some spurious names to the list of real participants (e.g. Burgundians, Sciri and Franks) for dramatic effect.
