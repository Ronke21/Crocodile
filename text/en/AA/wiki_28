<doc id="1789" wikidata="Q170512" url="?curid=1789" title="Apuleius">
<text>Apuleius ( ; also called Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis; c. 124 – after 170) was a Numidian Latin-language prose writer, Platonist philosopher and rhetorician. He was born in the Roman province of Numidia, in the Berber city of Madauros, modern-day M&#x27;Daourouch, Algeria. He studied Platonism in Athens, travelled to Italy, Asia Minor, and Egypt, and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha, near Oea (modern Tripoli, Libya). This is known as the &quot;Apologia&quot;.

His most famous work is his bawdy picaresque novel the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;. It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the adventures of its protagonist, Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a donkey. Lucius goes through various adventures before he is turned back into a human being by the goddess Isis.

== Life ==
Apuleius was born in Madauros, a &quot;colonia&quot; in Numidia on the North African coast bordering Gaetulia, and he described himself as &quot;half-Numidian half-Gaetulian.&quot; Madaurus was the same &quot;colonia&quot; where Augustine of Hippo later received part of his early education, and, though located well away from the Romanized coast, is today the site of some pristine Roman ruins. As to his first name, no &quot;praenomen&quot; is given in any ancient source; late-medieval manuscripts began the tradition of calling him &quot;Lucius&quot; from the name of the hero of his novel. Details regarding his life come mostly from his defense speech (&quot;Apology&quot;) and his work &quot;Florida&quot;, which consists of snippets taken from some of his best speeches.

His father was a municipal magistrate (&quot;duumvir&quot;) who bequeathed at his death the sum of nearly two million sesterces to his two sons. Apuleius studied with a master at Carthage (where he later settled) and later at Athens, where he studied Platonist philosophy among other subjects. He subsequently went to Rome to study Latin rhetoric and, most likely, to speak in the law courts for a time before returning to his native North Africa. He also travelled extensively in Asia Minor and Egypt, studying philosophy and religion, burning up his inheritance while doing so.

Apuleius was an initiate in several Greco-Roman mysteries, including the Dionysian Mysteries. He was a priest of Asclepius and, according to Augustine, &quot;sacerdos provinciae Africae&quot; (i.e., priest of the province of Carthage).

Not long after his return home he set out upon a new journey to Alexandria. On his way there he was taken ill at the town of Oea (modern-day Tripoli) and was hospitably received into the house of Sicinius Pontianus, with whom he had been friends when he had studied in Athens. The mother of Pontianus, Pudentilla, was a very rich widow. With her son&#x27;s consent – indeed encouragement – Apuleius agreed to marry her. Meanwhile, Pontianus himself married the daughter of one Herennius Rufinus; he, indignant that Pudentilla&#x27;s wealth should pass out of the family, instigated his son-in-law, together with a younger brother, Sicinius Pudens, a mere boy, and their paternal uncle, Sicinius Aemilianus, to join him in impeaching Apuleius upon the charge that he had gained the affections of Pudentilla by charms and magic spells. The case was heard at Sabratha, near Tripoli, c. 158 AD, before Claudius Maximus, proconsul of Africa. The accusation itself seems to have been ridiculous, and the spirited and triumphant defence spoken by Apuleius is still extant. This is known as the &quot;Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)&quot;.

Apuleius accused an extravagant personal enemy of turning his house into a brothel and prostituting his own wife.

Of his subsequent career, we know little. Judging from the many works of which he was author, he must have devoted himself diligently to literature. He occasionally gave speeches in public to great reception; he had the charge of exhibiting gladiatorial shows and wild beast events in the province, and statues were erected in his honour by the senate of Carthage and of other senates.

The date, place and circumstances of Apuleius&#x27; death are not known. There is no record of his activities after 170, a fact which has led some people to believe that he must have died about then (say in 171), although other scholars feel that he may still have been alive in 180 or even 190.

== Works ==
=== &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; ===

&quot;The Golden Ass&quot; (&quot;Asinus Aureus&quot;) or &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the adventures of one Lucius, who introduces himself as related to the famous philosophers Plutarch and Sextus of Chaeronea. Lucius experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into an ass. In this guise, he hears and sees many unusual things, until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way. Within this frame story are found many digressions, the longest among them being the well-known tale of Cupid and Psyche. This story is a rare instance of a fairy tale preserved in an ancient literary text.

The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; ends with the (once again human) hero, Lucius, eager to be initiated into the mystery cult of Isis; he abstains from forbidden foods, bathes, and purifies himself. He is introduced to the &quot;Navigium Isidis&quot;. Then the secrets of the cult&#x27;s books are explained to him, and further secrets are revealed before he goes through the process of initiation, which involves a trial by the elements on a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of Osiris in Rome, and eventually is initiated into the &quot;pastophoroi&quot; – a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris.

=== &quot;Apologia&quot; ===

 () is the version of the defence presented in Sabratha, in 158–159, before the proconsul Claudius Maximus, by Apuleius accused of the crime of magic. Between the traditional exordium and peroratio, the argumentation is divided into three sections:
# Refutation of the accusations levelled against his private life. He demonstrates that by marrying Pudentilla he had no interested motive and that he carries it away, intellectually and morally, on his opponents.
# Attempt to prove that his so-called &quot;magical operations&quot; were in fact indispensable scientific experiments for an imitator of Aristotle and Hippocrates, or the religious acts of a Roman Platonist.
# A recount of the events that have occurred in Oea since his arrival and pulverize the arguments against him.
The main interest of the is historical, as it offers substantial information about its author, magic and life in Africa in the second century.

=== Other ===
His other works are:
* &quot;Florida&quot;. A compilation of twenty-three extracts from his various speeches and lectures.
* &quot;De Platone et dogmate eius (On Plato and his Doctrine)&quot;. An outline in two books of Plato&#x27;s physics and ethics, preceded by a life of Plato
* &quot; (On the God of Socrates)&quot;. A work on the existence and nature of daemons, the intermediaries between gods and humans. This treatise was attacked by Augustine of Hippo. It contains a passage comparing gods and kings which is the first recorded occurrence of the proverb &quot;familiarity breeds contempt&quot;:
* &quot;On the Universe&quot;. This Latin translation of Pseudo-Aristotle&#x27;s work &quot;De Mundo&quot; is probably by Apuleius.

Apuleius wrote many other works which have not survived. He wrote works of poetry and fiction, as well as technical treatises on politics, dendrology, agriculture, medicine, natural history, astronomy, music, and arithmetic, and he translated Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;.

=== Spurious ===

Extant works wrongly attributed to Apuleius include:
* &quot;Peri Hermeneias&quot; (&quot;On interpretation&quot;). A brief Latin version of a guide to Aristotelian logic.
* &quot;Asclepius&quot;. A Latin paraphrase of a lost Greek dialogue (&quot;The perfect discourse&quot;) featuring Asclepius and Hermes Trismegistus.
* &quot;Herbarium Apuleii Platonici&quot; by Pseudo-Apuleius.

== Apuleian Sphere ==
The Apuleian Sphere described in &quot;Petosiris to Nechepso&quot;, also known as &quot;Columcille&#x27;s Circle&quot; or &quot;Petosiris&#x27; Circle&quot;, is a magical prognosticating device for predicting the survival of a patient.

<doc id="1790" wikidata="Q223797" url="?curid=1790" title="Alexander Selkirk">
<text>Alexander Selkirk (167613 December 1721) was a Scottish privateer and Royal Navy officer who spent four years and four months as a castaway (1704–1709) after being marooned by his captain, initially at his request, on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean. He survived that ordeal, but died from a tropical illness (most likely yellow fever) years later while serving as a lieutenant aboard off West Africa.

Selkirk was an unruly youth and joined buccaneering voyages to the South Pacific during the War of the Spanish Succession. One such expedition was on &quot;Cinque Ports&quot;, captained by Thomas Stradling, under the overall command of William Dampier. Stradling&#x27;s ship stopped to resupply at the uninhabited Juan Fernández Islands, west of South America, and Selkirk judged correctly that the craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there. Selkirk&#x27;s suspicions were soon justified, as &quot;Cinque Ports&quot; foundered near Malpelo Island 400 km (250 mi) from the coast of what is now Colombia.

By the time he was eventually rescued by the privateer Woodes Rogers, who was accompanied by Dampier, Selkirk had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources that he found on the island. His story of survival was widely publicized after his return, becoming one of the reputed sources of inspiration for the English writer Daniel Defoe&#x27;s fictional character Robinson Crusoe.

==Early life and privateering==
Alexander Selkirk was the son of a shoemaker and tanner in Lower Largo, Fife, Scotland, born in 1676. In his youth, he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition. He was summoned before the Kirk Session in August 1693 for his &quot;indecent conduct in church&quot;, but he &quot;did not appear, being gone to sea&quot;. He was back at Largo in 1701 when he again came to the attention of church authorities for assaulting his brothers.

Early on, he was engaged in buccaneering. In 1703, he joined an expedition of English privateer and explorer William Dampier to the South Pacific Ocean, setting sail from Kinsale in Ireland on 11 September. They carried letters of marque from the Lord High Admiral authorizing their armed merchant ships to attack foreign enemies as the War of the Spanish Succession was then going on between England and Spain. Dampier was captain of &quot;St George&quot; and Selkirk served on &quot;Cinque Ports&quot;, &quot;St George&quot;″s companion ship, as sailing master under Captain Thomas Stradling. By this time, Selkirk must have had considerable experience at sea.

In February 1704, following a stormy passage around Cape Horn, the privateers fought a long battle with a well-armed French vessel, &quot;St Joseph&quot;, only to have it escape to warn its Spanish allies of their arrival in the Pacific. A raid on the Panamanian gold mining town of Santa María failed when their landing party was ambushed. The easy capture of &quot;Asunción&quot;, a heavily laden merchantman, revived the men&#x27;s hopes of plunder, and Selkirk was put in charge of the prize ship. Dampier took off some much-needed provisions of wine, brandy, sugar, and flour, then abruptly set the ship free, arguing that the gain was not worth the effort. In May 1704, Stradling decided to abandon Dampier and strike out on his own.

==Castaway==

In September 1704, after parting ways with Dampier, Captain Stradling brought &quot;Cinque Ports&quot; to an island known to the Spanish as Más a Tierra located in the uninhabited Juan Fernández archipelago off the coast of Chile for a mid-expedition restocking of fresh water and supplies.

Selkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of their vessel and wanted to make the necessary repairs before going any further. He declared that he would rather stay on Juan Fernández than continue in a dangerously leaky ship. Stradling took him up on the offer and landed Selkirk on the island with a musket, a hatchet, a knife, a cooking pot, a Bible, bedding and some clothes. Selkirk immediately regretted his rashness, but Stradling refused to let him back on board.

&quot;Cinque Ports&quot; later foundered off the coast of what is now Colombia. Stradling and &quot;six or seven of his Men&quot; survived the loss of their ship but were forced to surrender to the Spanish. They were taken to Lima where they endured a harsh imprisonment. Stradling attempted escape after stealing a canoe in Lima, but was recaptured and punished. The Spanish governor threatened to send all the survivors to the mines. The survivors ultimately returned to England after four years of imprisonment.

===Life on the island===
At first, Selkirk remained along the shoreline of Más a Tierra. During this time, he ate spiny lobsters and scanned the ocean daily for rescue, suffering all the while from loneliness, misery, and remorse. Hordes of raucous sea lions, gathering on the beach for the mating season, eventually drove him to the island&#x27;s interior. Once inland, his way of life took a turn for the better. More foods were available there: feral goats—introduced by earlier sailors—provided him with meat and milk, while wild turnips, the leaves of the indigenous cabbage tree and dried &quot;Schinus&quot; fruits (pink peppercorns) offered him variety and spice. Rats would attack him at night, but he was able to sleep soundly and in safety by domesticating and living near feral cats.
Selkirk proved resourceful in using materials that he found on the island: he forged a new knife out of barrel hoops left on the beach; built two huts out of pepper trees, one of which he used for cooking and the other for sleeping; and employed his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses. As his gunpowder dwindled, he had to chase prey on foot. During one such chase, he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff, lying helpless and unable to move for about a day. His prey had cushioned his fall, probably sparing him a broken back.

Childhood lessons learned from his father, a tanner, now served him well. For example, when his clothes wore out, he made new ones from hair-covered goatskins using a nail for sewing. As his shoes became unusable, he did not need to replace them, since his toughened, calloused feet made protection unnecessary. He sang psalms and read from the Bible, finding it a comfort in his situation and a prop for his English.

During his sojourn on the island, two vessels came to anchor. Unfortunately for Selkirk, both were Spanish. Being British and a privateer, he would have faced a grim fate if captured and therefore did his best to hide. Once, he was spotted and chased by a group of Spanish sailors from one of the ships. His pursuers urinated beneath the tree in which he was hiding but failed to notice him. The would-be captors then gave up and sailed away.

===Rescue===

Selkirk&#x27;s long-awaited deliverance came on 2 February 1709 by way of &quot;Duke&quot;, a privateering ship piloted by William Dampier, and its sailing companion &quot;Duchess&quot;. Thomas Dover led the landing party that met Selkirk. After four years and four months without human company, Selkirk was almost incoherent with joy. The &quot;Duke&quot; captain and leader of the expedition was Woodes Rogers, who wryly referred to Selkirk as the governor of the island. The agile castaway caught two or three goats a day and helped restore the health of Rogers&#x27; men, who had developed scurvy.

Captain Rogers was impressed by Selkirk&#x27;s physical vigour, but also by the peace of mind that he had attained while living on the island, observing: &quot;One may see that solitude and retirement from the world is not such an insufferable state of life as most men imagine, especially when people are fairly called or thrown into it unavoidably, as this man was.&quot; He made Selkirk &quot;Duke&quot;″s second mate, later giving him command of one of their prize ships, &quot;Increase&quot;, before it was ransomed by the Spanish.

Selkirk returned to privateering with a vengeance. At Guayaquil in present-day Ecuador, he led a boat crew up the Guayas River where several wealthy Spanish ladies had fled, and looted the gold and jewels they had hidden inside their clothing. His part in the hunt for treasure galleons along the coast of Mexico resulted in the capture of &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño&quot;, renamed &quot;Bachelor&quot;, on which he served as sailing master under Captain Dover to the Dutch East Indies. Selkirk completed the around-the-world voyage by the Cape of Good Hope as the sailing master of &quot;Duke&quot;, arriving at the Downs off the English coast on 1 October 1711. He had been away for eight years.

==Later life and influence==

Selkirk&#x27;s experience as a castaway aroused a great deal of attention in Britain. His fellow crewman Edward Cooke mentioned Selkirk&#x27;s ordeal in a book chronicling their privateering expedition, &quot;A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World&quot; (1712). A more detailed recounting was published by the expedition&#x27;s leader, Rogers, within months. The following year, prominent essayist Richard Steele wrote an article about him for &quot;The Englishman&quot; newspaper. Selkirk appeared set to enjoy a life of ease and celebrity, claiming his share of &quot;Duke&quot; plundered wealth—about £800 (equivalent to £ today). However, legal disputes made the amount of any payment uncertain.

After a few months in London, he began to seem more like his former self again. However, he still missed his secluded and solitary moments, remarking, &quot;I am now worth eight hundred pounds, but shall never be as &quot;happy&quot; as when I was not worth a farthing.&quot; In September 1713, he was charged with assaulting a shipwright in Bristol and might have been kept in confinement for two years. He returned to Lower Largo, where he met Sophia Bruce, a young dairymaid. They eloped to London early and married on 4 March 1717. He was soon off to sea again, having enlisted in the Royal Navy. While on a visit to Plymouth in 1720, he married a widowed innkeeper named Frances Candis. He was serving as an officer on board , engaged in an anti-piracy patrol off the west coast of Africa. The ship arrived near the mouth of the River Gambia in March 1721 and lingered due to damage from bad weather. The locals took several crew hostage and ransomed them for &quot;gold and food.&quot; As the ship sailed down the coast of West Africa, men went into the forests to cut wood and began to contract yellow fever from the swarms of mosquitoes, and perhaps typhoid. Four died in June and, by September, &quot;so many men were dying a makeshift hospital was erected on shore&quot; near Cape Coast Castle. Selkirk became sick in November with the same symptoms as his crewmates. He died on 13 December 1721 along with shipmate William King, and both were buried at sea; three more died the following day.

When Daniel Defoe published &quot;The Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719), few readers could have missed the resemblance to Selkirk. An illustration on the first page of the novel shows &quot;a rather melancholy-looking man standing on the shore of an island, gazing inland&quot;, in the words of modern explorer Tim Severin. He is dressed in the familiar hirsute goatskins, his feet and shins bare. Yet Crusoe&#x27;s island is located not in the mid-latitudes of the South Pacific but away in the Caribbean, where the furry attire would hardly be comfortable in the tropical heat. This incongruity supports the popular belief that Selkirk was a model for the fictional character, though most literary scholars now accept that he was &quot;just one of many survival narratives that Defoe knew about&quot;.

==In other literary works==

==In film==
&quot;Selkirk, the Real Robinson Crusoe&quot; is a stop motion film by Walter Tournier based on Selkirk&#x27;s life. It premièred simultaneously in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay on 2 February 2012, distributed by The Walt Disney Company. It was the first full-length animated feature to be produced in Uruguay.

==Commemoration==

Selkirk has been memorialized in his Scottish birthplace. Lord Aberdeen delivered a speech on 11 December 1885, after which his wife, Lady Aberdeen, unveiled a bronze statue and plaque in memory of Selkirk outside a house on the site of his original home on the Main Street of Lower Largo. David Gillies of Cardy House, Lower Largo, a descendant of the Selkirks, donated the statue created by Thomas Stuart Burnett.

The Scotsman is also remembered in his former island home. In 1869 the crew of placed a bronze tablet at a spot called Selkirk&#x27;s Lookout on a mountain of Más a Tierra, Juan Fernández Islands, to mark his stay. On 1 January 1966 Chilean president Eduardo Frei Montalva renamed Más a Tierra Robinson Crusoe Island after Defoe&#x27;s fictional character to attract tourists. The largest of the Juan Fernández Islands, known as Más Afuera, became Alejandro Selkirk Island, although Selkirk probably never saw that island since it is located to the west.

==Archaeological findings==
An archaeological expedition to the Juan Fernández Islands in February 2005 found part of a nautical instrument that likely belonged to Selkirk. It was &quot;a fragment of copper alloy identified as being from a pair of navigational dividers&quot; dating from the early 18th (or late 17th) century. Selkirk is the only person known to have been on the island at that time who is likely to have had dividers and was even said by Rogers to have had such instruments in his possession. The artifact was discovered while excavating a site not far from Selkirk&#x27;s Lookout where the famous castaway is believed to have lived.
In 1825, during John Howell&#x27;s research of Alexander Selkirk&#x27;s biography, his &quot;flip-can&quot; was in the possession of his great-grand-nephew John Selkirk, and Alexander&#x27;s musket was &quot;in the possession of Major Lumsden of Lathallan.&quot;

The term &quot;anti-ballistic missile&quot; is a generic term for a system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat; however, it is commonly used for systems specifically designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

==Current counter-ICBM systems==

There are a limited number of systems worldwide that can intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles:

* The Russian A-135 anti-ballistic missile system (upgraded in 2017 to A-235) is used for the defense of Moscow. It became operational in 1995 and was preceded by the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system. The system uses Gorgon and Gazelle missiles previously armed with nuclear warheads. These missiles have been updated (2017) and use non-nuclear kinetic interceptors instead, to intercept any incoming ICBMs.
* The Israeli Arrow 3 system entered operational service in 2017. It is designed for exo-atmosphere interception of ballistic missiles during the spaceflight portion of their trajectory, including those of ICBMs. It may also act as an anti-satellite weapon.
* The American Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, formerly known as National Missile Defense (NMD), was first tested in 1997 and had its first successful intercept test in 1999. Instead of using an explosive charge, it launches a hit-to-kill kinetic projectile to intercept an ICBM. The current GMD system is intended to shield the United States mainland against a limited nuclear attack by a rogue state such as North Korea. GMD does not have the ability to protect against an all-out nuclear attack from Russia, as there are currently only 44 ground-based interceptors available to counter projectiles headed towards the US. (This interceptor count does not include the THAAD, or Aegis, or Patriot defenses which provide shorter range defence against incoming projectiles.)
* The Aegis ballistic missile defense-equipped SM-3 Block II-A missile demonstrated it can shoot down an ICBM target on 16 Nov 2020.
**In a November 2020 test, the US launched a surrogate ICBM from Kwajalein Atoll toward Hawaii in the general direction of the continental US, which triggered a satellite warning to a Colorado Air Force base. In response, launched a missile which destroyed the surrogate ICBM, while still outside the atmosphere.

===American plans for Central European site===

During 1993, a symposium was held by western European nations to discuss potential future ballistic missile defence programs. In the end, the council recommended deployment of early warning and surveillance systems as well as regionally controlled defence systems.
During spring 2006 reports about negotiations between the United States, Poland, and the Czech Republic were published.
The plans propose the installation of a latest generation ABM system with a radar site in the Czech Republic and the launch site in Poland. The system was announced to be aimed against ICBMs from Iran and North Korea. This caused harsh comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) security conference during spring 2007 in Munich. Other European ministers commented that any change of strategic weapons should be negotiated on NATO level and not &#x27;unilaterally&#x27; [sic, actually bilaterally] between the U.S. and other states (although most strategic arms reduction treaties were between the Soviet Union and U.S., not NATO). The German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, expressed severe concerns about the way in which the U.S. had conveyed its plans to its European partners and criticised the U.S. administration for not having consulted Russia prior to announcing its endeavours to deploy a new missile defence system in Central Europe. According to a July 2007 survey, a majority of Poles were opposed to hosting a component of the system in Poland.
By 28 July 2016 Missile Defense Agency planning and agreements had clarified enough to give more details about the Aegis Ashore sites in Romania (2014) and Poland (2018).

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

==== Historical Project 640 ====
Project 640 had been the PRC&#x27;s indigenous effort to develop ABM capability. The Academy of Anti-Ballistic Missile &amp; Anti-Satellite was established from 1969 for the purpose of developing Project 640. The project was to involve at least three elements, including the necessary sensors and guidance/command system, the Fan Ji (FJ) missile interceptor, and the XianFeng missile-intercepting cannon. The FJ-1 had completed two successful flight tests during 1979, while the low-altitude interceptor FJ-2 completed some successful flight tests using scaled prototypes. A high altitude FJ-3 interceptor was also proposed. Despite the development of missiles, the programme was slowed down due to financial and political reasons. It was finally closed down during 1980 under a new leadership of Deng Xiaoping as it was seemingly deemed unnecessary after the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States and the closure of the US Safeguard ABM system.

==== Operational Chinese systems ====
In March 2006, China tested an interceptor system comparable to the U.S. Patriot missiles.

China has acquired and is license-producing the S-300PMU-2/S-300PMU-1 series of terminal ABM-capable SAMs. The HQ-9 SAM system and HQ-15 may possess terminal ABM capabilities. PRC Navy&#x27;s operating modern air-defense destroyers known as the Type 052C Destroyer and Type 051C Destroyer are armed with naval HQ-9 missiles.

The HQ-19, roughly analogous to the THAAD, was first tested in 2003, and subsequently a few more times, including in November 2015. The HQ-29, a counterpart to the MIM-104F PAC-3, was first tested in 2011.

China carried out a land-based anti-ballistic missile test on 11 January 2010. The test was exoatmospheric and the intercept performed in midcourse phase by a kinetic kill vehicle. The interceptor missile was a SC-19. The sources suggest the system was not operationally deployed as of 2010.

On 27 January 2013, China conducted another anti-ballistic missile test. According to the Chinese Defense Ministry, the missile launch was defensive in character and was not aimed against any countries. On 4 February 2021, China reportedly conducted a mid-course intercept anti-ballistic missile test. 

=== Europe ===
==== Aster ====
The Aster is a family of missiles jointly developed by France and Italy. The Aster 30 variants are capable of ballistic missile defense. An export customer, the United Kingdom also operates the Aster 30 Block 0.

On 18 October 2010, France announced a successful tactical ABM test of the Aster 30 missile and on 1 December 2011 a successful interception of a Black Sparrow ballistic target missile. The s in French and Italian service, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 45 destroyers, and the French and Italian FREMM-class frigates are all armed with PAAMS (or variants of it) integrating Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles. France and Italy are developing a new variant, the Aster 30 Block II, which can destroy ballistic missiles up to a maximum range of . It will incorporate a kill vehicle warhead.

==== HYDIS² ====
Involving France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, the HYDIS² (HYpersonic Defence Interceptor Study) was announced on June 20, 2023 and is a project led by MBDA. It was selected in March 2023 and is partially funded by the European Defense Fund (EDF). Its aim is to propose an architecture and technology maturation concept study for an endo-atmospheric interceptor to counter new, highly sophisticated emerging threats. HYDIS² is centered around the MBDA&#x27;s Aquila hypersonic missile interceptor concept and will involve a consortium of 19 partners and over 30 subcontractors from 14 European countries. France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have already confirmed their support and commitment, by signing a letter of intent and agreeing to initial joint requirements. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a countermeasure that could be integrated into the French-led EU TWISTER (Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based TheatER surveillance) capability program. TWISTER, launched in 2019 with MBDA France acting as lead contractor as well, is intended to be an air defense system capable of early warning, tracking and intercepting high-performance air threats, including defense against ballistic missiles (BMD) and hypersonic vehicles. The program involves France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Finland and Germany.

==== EU HYDEF ====
Competing against HYDIS², the EU HYDEF (European Hypersonic Defence Interceptor) also covers the concept phase to develop an endo-atmospheric interceptor and is related to TWISTER. Selected in July 2022, it is also partially funded by the EDF. It is coordinated by Spain&#x27;s SENER Aeroespacial Sociedad Anonima, while Germany&#x27;s Diehl Defence is serving as the overall technical lead. They are heading a consortium of partners and subcontractors from various EU countries.

===India===

In November 2006, India successfully conducted the PADE (Prithvi Air Defence Exercise) in which an anti-ballistic missile, called the Prithvi Air Defence (PAD), an &quot;exo-atmospheric&quot; (outside the atmosphere) interceptor system, intercepted a Prithvi-II ballistic missile. The PAD missile has the secondary stage of the Prithvi missile and can reach altitude of . During the test, the target missile was intercepted at a altitude. On 6 December 2007, the Advanced Air Defence (AAD) missile system was tested successfully. This missile is an endo-atmospheric interceptor with an altitude of . First reported in 2009, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is developing a new Prithvi interceptor missile code-named PDV. The PDV is designed to take out the target missile at altitudes above . The first PDV was successfully test fired on 27 April 2014. On 15 May 2016, India successfully launched AAD renamed Ashwin from Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha.
As of 8 January 2020, the BMD programme has been completed and the Indian Air Force and the DRDO are awaiting government&#x27;s final approval before the system is deployed to protect New Delhi and then Mumbai. After these two cities, it will be deployed in other major cities and regions. PAD and PDV are designed for mid-course interception, while AAD is for terminal phase interception. India had previously planned to acquire NASAMS-II but the Indian Air Force instead is now seeking a domestic alternative (potentially the land-based VL-SRSAM).

=== Iran ===

Iran used Arman and S-300 missile systems for ballistic missile defense.

=== Israel ===
====Arrow 2====
The Arrow project was begun after the U.S. and Israel agreed to co-fund it on 6 May 1986.

The Arrow ABM system was designed and constructed in Israel with financial support by the United States by a multibillion-dollar development program called &quot;Minhelet Homa&quot; (Wall Administration) with the participation of companies like Israel Military Industries, Tadiran and Israel Aerospace Industries.

During 1998 the Israeli military conducted a successful test of their Arrow missile. Designed to intercept incoming missiles travelling at up to 2-mile/s (3 km/s), the Arrow is expected to perform much better than the Patriot did in the Gulf War. On 29 July 2004 Israel and the United States carried out a joint experiment in the US, in which the Arrow was launched against a real Scud missile. The experiment was a success, as the Arrow destroyed the Scud with a direct hit. During December 2005 the system was deployed successfully in a test against a replicated Shahab-3 missile. This feat was repeated on 11 February 2007.

==== Arrow 3 ====
The Arrow 3 system is capable of exo-atmosphere interception of ballistic missiles, including of ICBMs. It also acts as an anti-satellite weapon.

Lieutenant General Patrick J. O&#x27;Reilly, Director of the US Missile Defense Agency, said: &quot;The design of Arrow 3 promises to be an extremely capable system, more advanced than what we have ever attempted in the U.S. with our programs.&quot;

On 10 December 2015 Arrow 3 scored its first intercept in a complex test designed to validate how the system can detect, identify, track and then discriminate real from decoy targets delivered into space by an improved Silver Sparrow target missile. According to officials, the milestone test paves the way toward low-rate initial production of the Arrow 3.

====David’s sling====
David&#x27;s Sling (Hebrew: קלע דוד), also sometimes called Magic Wand (Hebrew: שרביט קסמים), is an Israel Defense Forces military system being jointly developed by the Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the American defense contractor Raytheon, designed to intercept tactical ballistic missiles, as well as medium- to long-range rockets and slower-flying cruise missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah, fired at ranges from 40 km to 300 km. It is designed with the aim of intercepting the newest generation of tactical ballistic missiles, such as Iskander.

=== Japan ===
Since 1998, when North Korea launched a Taepodong-1 missile over northern Japan, the Japanese have been jointly developing a new surface-to-air interceptor known as the Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) with the US. Tests have been successful, and there are 11 locations that are planned for the PAC-3 to be installed. The approximate locations are near major air bases, like Kadena Air Base, and ammunition storage centers of the Japanese military. The exact location are not known to the public. A military spokesman said that tests had been done on two sites, one of them a business park in central Tokyo, and Ichigaya – a site not far from the Imperial Palace.
Along with the PAC-3, Japan has installed a US-developed ship-based anti-ballistic missile system, which was tested successfully on 18 December 2007. Japan has 4 destroyers of this type capable of carrying RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 and equipped with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. Japan is currently modifying another 4 destroyers so that they can take part of their defense force against ballistic missiles, bringing the total number to 8 ships.

===Soviet Union/Russian Federation===

The Moscow ABM defense system was designed with the aim of being able to intercept the ICBM warheads aimed at Moscow and other important industrial regions, and is based on:
* A-35 Aldan
** ABM-1 Galosh / 5V61 (decommissioned)
* A-35M
** ABM-1B (decommissioned)
* A-135 Amur
** ABM-3 Gazelle / 53T6
** ABM-4 Gorgon / 51T6 (decommissioned)
* A–235 Nudol (In development)
* S-300P (SA-10)
* S-300V/V4 (SA-12)
* S-300PMU-1/2 (SA-20)
* S-400 (SA-21)
* S-300VM (SA-23)
* S-500 Prometey (serial production began in 2021)

===United States===
In several tests, the U.S. military have demonstrated the feasibility of destroying long and short range ballistic missiles. Combat effectiveness of newer systems against 1950s tactical ballistic missiles seems very high, as the MIM-104 Patriot (PAC-1 and PAC-2) had a 100% success rate in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The U.S. Navy Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis BMD) uses RIM-161 Standard Missile 3, which hit a target going faster than ICBM warheads. On 16 November 2020 an SM-3 Block IIA interceptor successfully destroyed an ICBM in mid-course, under Link-16 Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC).

The U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system began production in 2008. Its stated range as a short to intermediate ballistic missile interceptor means that it is not designed to hit midcourse ICBMs, which can reach terminal phase speeds of mach 8 or greater. The THAAD interceptor has a reported maximum speed of mach 8, and THAAD has repeatedly proven it can intercept descending exoatmospheric missiles in a ballistic trajectory.

The U.S. Army Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system was developed by the Missile Defense Agency. It combines ground-based AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning Radar installations and mobile AN/TPY-2 X-band radars with 44 exoatmospheric interceptors stationed in underground silos around California and Alaska, to protect against low-count ICBM attacks from rogue states. Each Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) rocket carries an Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) kinetic kill interceptor, with 97% probability of intercept when four interceptors are launched at the target.

Since 2004, the United States Army plans to replace Raytheon&#x27;s Patriot missile (SAM) engagement control station (ECS), along with seven other forms of ABM defense command systems, with Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) designed to shoot down short, medium, and intermediate range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase by intercepting with a hit-to-kill approach. 
Northrop Grumman was selected as the prime contractor in 2010; the Army spent $2.7 billion on the program between 2009 and 2020. IBCS engagement stations will support identification and tracking of targets using sensor fusion from disparate data streams, and selection of appropriate kill vehicles from available launcher systems. 
In February 2022 THAAD radar and TFCC (THAAD Fire Control &amp; Communication) demonstrated their interoperability with Patriot PAC-3 MSE missile launchers, engaging targets using both THAAD and Patriot interceptors.

===Republic of China===

Procurement of MIM-104 Patriot and indigenous Tien-Kung anti-ballistic missile systems. With the tense situations with China, Taiwan developed the Sky Bow (or Tien-Kung), this surface-to-air missile can intercept and destroy enemy aircraft and ballistic missiles. These system was created in partnership with Raytheon Technologies, using Lockheed Martin ADAR-HP as inspiration to create the Chang Bai S-band radar system. The missiles have a range of 200 km and was designed to take on fast moving vehicles with low radar cross-section. The latest variant of this system is the Sky Bow III (TK-3).

=== South Korea ===
Since North Korea started developing its nuclear weapon program, South Korea has been under imminent danger. South Korea started its BDM program by acquiring 8 batteries of the MIM-104 Patriot (PAC-2) missiles from the United States. The PAC-2 was developed to destroy incoming aircraft and is now unreliable in defending a ballistic missile attack from North Korea, as they have developed further their nuclear program. As of 2018, South Korea decided to improve its defense system by upgrading to the PAC-3, which has a hit-to-kill capability against incoming missiles. The main reason that the South Korean anti-ballistic defense system is not very developed is because they have tried to developed their own, without help from other countries, since the beginning of the 1990s. The South Korean Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) has confirmed that it has test launched the L-SAM system in February 2022. This particular missile has been in development since 2019 and is South Korea&#x27;s next anti-ballistic missile generation. It is expected to have a range of 150 km and be able to intercept targets between 40 km and 100 km of altitude, and it can also be used as an aircraft interceptor. The L-SAM system is expected to be complete and ready to use in 2024.

==History ==

===1940s and 1950s===

The idea of destroying rockets before they can hit their target dates from the first use of modern missiles in warfare, the German V-1 and V-2 program of World War II.

British fighters destroyed some V-1 &quot;buzz bombs&quot; in flight, although concentrated barrages of heavy anti-aircraft artillery had greater success. Under the lend-lease program, 200 US 90 mm AA guns with SCR-584 radars and Western Electric/Bell Labs computers were sent to the UK. These demonstrated a 95% success rate against V-1s that flew into their range.

The V-2, the first true ballistic missile, has no known record of being destroyed in the air. SCR-584&#x27;s could be used to plot the trajectories of the missiles and provide some warning, but were more useful in backtracking their ballistic trajectory and determining the rough launch locations. The Allies launched Operation Crossbow to find and destroy V-2s before launch, but these operations were largely ineffective. In one instance a Spitfire happened upon a V-2 rising through the trees, and fired on it with no effect. This led to allied efforts to capture launching sites in Belgium and the Netherlands.

A wartime study by Bell Labs into the task of shooting down ballistic missiles in flight concluded it was not possible. In order to intercept a missile, one needs to be able to steer the attack onto the missile before it hits. A V-2&#x27;s speed would require guns of effectively instantaneous reaction time, or some sort of weapon with ranges on the order of dozens of miles, neither of which appeared possible. This was, however, just before the emergence of high-speed computing systems. By the mid-1950s, things had changed considerably, and many forces worldwide were considering ABM systems.

The American armed forces began experimenting with anti-missile missiles soon after World War II, as the extent of German research into rocketry became clear. Project Wizard began in 1946, with the aim of creating a missile capable of intercepting the V-2.

But defences against Soviet long-range bombers took priority until 1957, when the Soviet Union demonstrated its advances in ICBM technology with the launch of Sputnik, the Earth&#x27;s first artificial satellite. The US Army accelerated development of their LIM-49 Nike Zeus system in response. Zeus was criticized throughout its development program, especially from those within the US Air Force and nuclear weapons establishments who suggested it would be much simpler to build more nuclear warheads and guarantee mutually assured destruction. Zeus was eventually cancelled in 1963.

In 1958, the U.S. sought to explore whether airbursting nuclear weapons might be used to ward off ICBMs. It conducted several test explosions of low-yield nuclear weapons – 1.7kt boosted fission W25 warheads – launched from ships to very high altitudes over the southern Atlantic Ocean. Such an explosion releases a burst of X-rays in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, causing secondary showers of charged particles over an area hundreds of miles across. These can become trapped in the Earth&#x27; magnetic field, creating an artificial radiation belt. It was believed that this might be strong enough to damage warheads traveling through the layer. This proved not to be the case, but Argus returned key data about a related effect, the nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP).

===Canada===
Other countries were also involved in early ABM research. A more advanced project was at CARDE in Canada, which researched the main problems of ABM systems. A key problem with any radar system is that the signal is in the form of a cone, which spreads with distance from the transmitter. For long-distance interceptions like ABM systems, the inherent inaccuracy of the radar makes an interception difficult. CARDE considered using a terminal guidance system to address the accuracy concerns, and developed several advanced infrared detectors for this role. They also studied a number of missile airframe designs, a new and much more powerful solid rocket fuel, and numerous systems for testing it all. After a series of drastic budget reductions during the late 1950s the research ended. One offshoot of the project was Gerald Bull&#x27;s system for inexpensive high-speed testing, consisting of missile airframes shot from a sabot round, which would later be the basis of Project HARP. Another was the CRV7 and Black Brant rockets, which used the new solid rocket fuel.

===Soviet Union===

The Soviet military had requested funding for ABM research as early as 1953, but were only given the go-ahead to begin deployment of such a system on 17 August 1956. Their test system, known simply as System A, was based on the V-1000 missile, which was similar to the early US efforts. The first successful test interception was carried out on 24 November 1960, and the first with a live warhead on 4 March 1961. In this test, a dummy warhead was released by a R-12 ballistic missile launched from the Kapustin Yar, and intercepted by a V-1000 launched from Sary-Shagan. The dummy warhead was destroyed by the impact of 16,000 tungsten-carbide spherical impactors 140 seconds after launch, at an altitude of .

The V-1000 missile system was nonetheless considered not reliable enough and abandoned in favour of nuclear-armed ABMs. Retired V-1000 was used to develop 1Ya2TA sounding rocket, capable of launching 520 kg scientific payload to an altitude of 400 km. A much larger missile, the Fakel 5V61 (known in the west as Galosh), was developed to carry the larger warhead and carry it much further from the launch site. Further development continued, and the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system, designed to protect Moscow, became operational in 1971. A-35 was designed for exoatmospheric interceptions, and would have been highly susceptible to a well-arranged attack using multiple warheads and radar black-out techniques.

A-35 was upgraded during the 1980s to a two-layer system, the A-135. The Gorgon (SH-11/ABM-4) long-range missile was designed to handle intercepts outside the atmosphere, and the Gazelle (SH-08/ABM-3) short-range missile endoatmospheric intercepts that eluded Gorgon. The A-135 system is considered to be technologically equivalent to the United States Safeguard system of 1975.

===American Nike-X and Sentinel===
Nike Zeus failed to be a credible defense in an era of rapidly increasing ICBM counts due to its ability to attack only one target at a time. Additionally, significant concerns about its ability to successfully intercept warheads in the presence of high-altitude nuclear explosions, including its own, lead to the conclusion that the system would simply be too costly for the very low amount of protection it could provide.

By the time it was cancelled in 1963, potential upgrades had been explored for some time. Among these were radars capable of scanning much greater volumes of space and able to track many warheads and launch several missiles at once. These, however, did not address the problems identified with radar blackouts caused by high-altitude explosions. To address this need, a new missile with extreme performance was designed to attack incoming warheads at much lower altitudes, as low as 20 km. The new project encompassing all of these upgrades was launched as Nike-X.

The main missile was LIM-49 Spartan—a Nike Zeus upgraded for longer range and a much larger 5 megaton warhead intended to destroy enemy&#x27;s warheads with a burst of x-rays outside the atmosphere. A second shorter-range missile called Sprint with very high acceleration was added to handle warheads that evaded longer-ranged Spartan. Sprint was a very fast missile (some sources claimed it accelerated to 8,000 mph (13 000 km/h) within 4 seconds of flight—an average acceleration of &quot;90 g&quot;) and had a smaller W66 enhanced radiation warhead in the 1–3 kiloton range for in-atmosphere interceptions.

The experimental success of Nike X persuaded the Lyndon B. Johnson administration to propose a thin ABM defense, that could provide almost complete coverage of the United States. In a September 1967 speech, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara referred to it as &quot;Sentinel&quot;. McNamara, a private ABM opponent because of cost and feasibility (see cost-exchange ratio), claimed that Sentinel would be directed not against the Soviet Union&#x27;s missiles (since the USSR had more than enough missiles to overwhelm any American defense), but rather against the potential nuclear threat of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In the meantime, a public debate over the merit of ABMs began. Difficulties that had already made an ABM system questionable for defending against an all-out attack. One problem was the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) that would give little warning to the defense. Another problem was high altitude EMP (whether from offensive or defensive nuclear warheads) which could degrade defensive radar systems.

When this proved infeasible for economic reasons, a much smaller deployment using the same systems was proposed, namely Safeguard (described later).

===Defense against MIRVs===
ABM systems were developed initially to counter single warheads launched from large intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The economics seemed simple enough; since rocket costs increase rapidly with size, the price of the ICBM launching a large warhead should always be greater than the much smaller interceptor missile needed to destroy it. In an arms race the defense would always win.

In addition to the blast effect, the detonation of nuclear devices against attacking intercontinental ballistic missiles produces a neutron kill effect from the strong radiation emitted, and this neutralizes the warhead, or warheads, of the attacking missile. Most A.B.M. devices depend on neutron kill for their effectiveness.

In practice, the price of the interceptor missile was considerable, due to its sophistication. The system had to be guided all the way to an interception, which demanded guidance and control systems that worked within and outside the atmosphere. Due to their relatively short ranges, an ABM missile would be needed to counter an ICBM wherever it might be aimed. That implies that dozens of interceptors are needed for every ICBM since warhead&#x27;s targets couldn&#x27;t be known in advance. This led to intense debates about the &quot;cost-exchange ratio&quot; between interceptors and warheads.

Conditions changed dramatically in 1970 with the introduction of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) warheads. Suddenly, each launcher was throwing not one warhead, but several. These would spread out in space, ensuring that a single interceptor would be needed for each warhead. This simply added to the need to have several interceptors for each warhead in order to provide geographical coverage. Now it was clear that an ABM system would always be many times more expensive than the ICBMs they defended against.
===Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972===

Technical, economic and political problems described resulted in the ABM treaty of 1972, which restricted the deployment of strategic (not tactical) anti-ballistic missiles.

By the ABM treaty and a 1974 revision, each country was allowed to deploy a mere 100 ABMs to protect a single, small area. The Soviets retained their Moscow defences. The U.S. designated their ICBM sites near Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, where Safeguard was already under advanced development. The radar systems and anti-ballistic missiles were approximately 90 miles north/northwest of Grand Forks AFB, near Concrete, North Dakota. The missiles were deactivated in 1975. The main radar site (PARCS) is still used as an early warning ICBM radar, facing relative north. It is located at Cavalier Air Force Station, North Dakota.

===Brief use of Safeguard in 1975/1976===
The U.S. Safeguard system, which utilized the nuclear-tipped LIM-49A Spartan and Sprint missiles, in the short operational period of 1975/1976, was the second counter-ICBMs system in the world. Safeguard protected only the main fields of US ICBMs from attack, theoretically ensuring that an attack could be responded to with a US launch, enforcing the mutually assured destruction principle.

===SDI experiments in the 1980s===

The Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative (often referred to as &quot;Star Wars&quot;), along with research into various energy-beam weaponry, brought new interest in the area of ABM technologies.

SDI was an extremely ambitious program to provide a total shield against a massive Soviet ICBM attack. The initial concept envisioned large sophisticated orbiting laser battle stations, space-based relay mirrors, and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites. Later research indicated that some planned technologies such as X-ray lasers were not feasible with then-current technology. As research continued, SDI evolved through various concepts as designers struggled with the difficulty of such a large complex defense system. SDI remained a research program and was never deployed. Several post-SDI technologies are used by the present Missile Defense Agency (MDA).

Lasers originally developed for the SDI plan are in use for astronomical observations. Used to ionize gas in the upper atmosphere, they provide telescope operators with a target to calibrate their instruments.

===Tactical ABMs deployed in 1990s===
The Israeli Arrow missile system was tested initially during 1990, before the first Gulf War. The Arrow was supported by the United States throughout the 1990s.

The Patriot was the first deployed tactical ABM system, although it was not designed from the outset for that task and consequently had limitations. It was used during the 1991 Gulf War to attempt to intercept Iraqi Scud missiles. Post-war analyses show that the Patriot was much less effective than initially thought because of its radar and control system&#x27;s inability to discriminate warheads from other objects when the Scud missiles broke up during reentry.
Testing ABM technology continued during the 1990s with mixed success. After the Gulf War, improvements were made to several U.S. air defense systems. A new Patriot, PAC-3, was developed and tested—a complete redesign of the PAC-2 deployed during the war, including a totally new missile. The improved guidance, radar and missile performance improves the probability of kill over the earlier PAC-2. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Patriot batteries engaged 100% of enemy TBMs within their engagement territory. Of these engagements, 8 of them were verified as kills by multiple independent sensors; the remaining was listed as a probable kill due to lack of independent verification. Patriot was involved in three friendly fire incidents: two incidents of Patriot shootings at coalition aircraft and one of U.S. aircraft shooting at a Patriot battery.

A new version of the Hawk missile was tested during the early to mid-1990s and by the end of 1998 the majority of US Marine Corps Hawk systems were modified to support basic theater anti-ballistic missile capabilities. The MIM-23 Hawk missile is not operational in U.S. service since 2002, but is used by many other countries.
Soon after the Gulf War, the Aegis Combat System was expanded to include ABM capabilities. The Standard missile system was also enhanced and tested for ballistic missile interception. During the late 1990s, SM-2 block IVA missiles were tested in a theater ballistic missile defense function. Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) systems have also been tested for an ABM role. In 2008, an SM-3 missile launched from the , successfully intercepted a non-functioning satellite.

===Brilliant Pebbles concept===
Approved for acquisition by the Pentagon during 1991 but never realized, Brilliant Pebbles was a proposed space-based anti-ballistic system that was meant to avoid some of the problems of the earlier SDI concepts. Rather than use sophisticated large laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites, Brilliant Pebbles consisted of a thousand very small, intelligent orbiting satellites with kinetic warheads. The system relied on improvements of computer technology, avoided problems with overly centralized command and control and risky, expensive development of large, complicated space defense satellites.
It promised to be much less expensive to develop and have less technical development risk.

The name Brilliant Pebbles comes from the small size of the satellite interceptors and great computational power enabling more autonomous targeting. Rather than rely exclusively on ground-based control, the many small interceptors would cooperatively communicate among themselves and target a large swarm of ICBM warheads in space or in the late boost phase. Development was discontinued later in favor of a limited ground-based defense.

===Transformation of SDI into MDA, development of NMD/GMD===
While the Reagan era Strategic Defense Initiative was intended to shield against a massive Soviet attack, during the early 1990s, President George H. W. Bush called for a more limited version using rocket-launched interceptors based on the ground at a single site. Such system was developed since 1992, was expected to become operational in 2010 and capable of intercepting small number of incoming ICBMs. First called the National Missile Defense (NMD), since 2002 it was renamed Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD). It was planned to protect all 50 states from a rogue missile attack. The Alaska site provides more protection against North Korean missiles or accidental launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the Middle East. The Alaska interceptors may be augmented later by the naval Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System or by ground-based missiles in other locations.

During 1998, Defense Secretary William Cohen proposed spending an additional $6.6 billion on intercontinental ballistic missile defense programs to build a system to protect against attacks from North Korea or accidental launches from Russia or China.

In terms of organization, during 1993 SDI was reorganized as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. In 2002, it was renamed to Missile Defense Agency (MDA).

===21st century===
On 13 June 2002, the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and recommenced developing missile defense systems that would have formerly been prohibited by the bilateral treaty. The action was stated as needed to defend against the possibility of a missile attack conducted by a rogue state. The next day, the Russian Federation dropped the START II agreement, intended to completely ban MIRVs.

The Lisbon Summit of 2010 saw the adoption of a NATO program that was formed in response to the threat of a rapid increase of ballistic missiles from potentially unfriendly regimes, though no specific region, state, or country was formally mentioned. This adoption came from the recognition of territorial missile defense as a core alliance objective. At this time, Iran was seen as the likely aggressor that eventually led to the adoption of this ABM system, as Iran has the largest missile arsenal of the Middle East, as well as a space program. From this summit, NATO&#x27;s ABM system was potentially seen as a threat by Russia, who felt that their ability to retaliate any perceived nuclear threats would be degraded. To combat this, Russia proposed that any ABM system enacted by NATO must be universal to operate, cover the entirety of the European continent, and not upset any nuclear parity. The United States actively sought NATO involvement in the creation of an ABM system, and saw an Iranian threat as a sufficient reason to warrant its creation. The United States also had plans to create missile defense facilities, but NATO officials feared that it would have provided protection to Europe, it would have detracted from the responsibility of NATO for collective defense. The officials also argued the potential prospect of U.S-commanded operation system that would work in conjunction with the Article 5 defense of NATO.

On 15 December 2016, the US Army SMDC had a successful test of a U.S. Army Zombie Pathfinder rocket, to be used as a target for exercising various anti-ballistic missile scenarios. The rocket was launched as part of NASA&#x27;s sounding rocket program, at White Sands Missile Range.

In November 2020, the US successfully destroyed a dummy ICBM. The ICBM was launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the general direction of Hawaii, triggering a satellite warning to a Colorado Air Force base, which then contacted the . The ship launched a SM-3 Block IIA missile to destroy the US dummy, still outside the atmosphere.

Missile defenses will not allow us to escape our vulnerability to nuclear weapons. Instead large-scale developments will create barriers to taking real steps toward reducing nuclear risks—by blocking further cuts in nuclear arsenals and potentially spurring new deployments.&quot; (p. 67.)

<text>The acre ( ) is a unit of land area used in the British imperial and the United States customary systems. It is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to 10 square chains, of a square mile, 4,840 square yards, or 43,560 square feet, and approximately 4,047 m2, or about 40% of a hectare. Based upon the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres. The acre is sometimes abbreviated ac but is usually spelled out as the word &quot;acre&quot;.

Traditionally, in the Middle Ages, an acre was conceived of as the area of land that could be ploughed by one man using a team of eight oxen in one day.

The acre is still a statutory measure in the United States. Both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but they differ by only four parts per million (see below). The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land.

The acre is used in many established and former Commonwealth of Nations countries by custom. In a few, it continues as a statute measure, although not since 2010 in the UK, and not for decades in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In many places where it is not a statute measure, it is still lawful to &quot;use for trade&quot; if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration.

==Description==
One acre equals (0.0015625) square mile, 4,840 square yards, 43,560 square feet, or about (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840 square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends upon the particular yard on which it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a strip of land sized at forty perches (660 ft, or 1 furlong) long and four perches (66 ft) wide; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day (a furlong being &quot;a furrow long&quot;). A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57 yards, or 208 feet 9 inches (), on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560 square feet is an acre.

==US survey acres==
In the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, the United States and five countries of the Commonwealth of Nations defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144 metre. The US authorities decided that, while the refined definition would apply nationally in all other respects, the US survey foot (and thus the survey acre) would continue &#x27;until such a time as it becomes desirable and expedient to readjust [it]&#x27;. By inference, an &quot;international acre&quot; may be calculated as exactly square metres but it does not have a basis in any international agreement.

Both the international acre and the US survey acre contain of a square mile or 4,840 square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used (see survey foot and survey yard), so the exact size of an acre depends upon the yard upon which it is based. The US survey acre is about 4,046.872 square metres; its exact value ( m2) is based on an inch defined by 1 metre = 39.37 inches exactly, as established by the Mendenhall Order of 1893. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.

Since the difference between the US survey acre and international acre (0.016 square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8 square inches), is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet or US letter, it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.

In October 2019, the US National Geodetic Survey and the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced their joint intent to end the &quot;temporary&quot; continuance of the US survey foot, mile, and acre units (as permitted by their 1959 decision, above), with effect from the end of 2022.

===Spanish acre===
The Puerto Rican &quot;cuerda&quot; () is sometimes called the &quot;Spanish acre&quot; in the continental United States.

== Use ==
The acre is commonly used in many current and former Commonwealth countries by custom, and in a few it continues as a statute measure. These include Antigua and Barbuda, American Samoa, The Bahamas, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Dominica, the Falkland Islands, Grenada, Ghana, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Jamaica, Montserrat, Samoa, Saint Lucia, St. Helena, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Turks and Caicos, the United Kingdom, the United States and the US Virgin Islands.

===Republic of Ireland===

In the Republic of Ireland, the hectare is legally used under European units of measurement directives; however, the acre (the same standard statute as used in the UK, not the old Irish acre, which was of a different size) is still widely used, especially in agriculture.

===Indian subcontinent===
In India, residential plots are measured in square feet or square metre, while agricultural land is measured in acres. In Sri Lanka, the division of an acre into 160 perches or 4 roods is common.

In Pakistan, residential plots are measured in (20 = 1  = 605 sq yards) and open/agriculture land measurement is in acres (8 = 1 acre) and (25 acres = 1 = 200 ), and .
===United Kingdom===
Its use as a primary unit for trade in the United Kingdom ceased to be permitted from 1 October 1995, due to the 1994 amendment of the Weights and Measures Act, where it was replaced by the hectare though its use as a supplementary unit continues to be permitted indefinitely. This was with the exemption of land registration, which records the sale and possession of land; in 2010 HM Land Registry ended its exemption. The measure is still used to communicate with the public and informally (non-contract) by the farming and property industries.

==Equivalence to other units of area==

1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:
* 0.40468564224 hectare (A square with 100 m sides has an area of 1 hectare.)
* 4,046.8564224 square metres (or a square with approximately 63.61 m sides)

1 United States survey acre is equal to:
* 0.404687261 hectare
* 4,046.87261 square metres (1 square kilometre is equal to 247.105 acres)

1 acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:
* 66 feet × 660 feet (43,560 square feet)
* 10 square chains (1 chain = 66 feet = 22 yards = 4 rods = 100 links)
* 1 acre is approximately 208.71 feet × 208.71 feet (a square)
* 4,840 square yards
* 43,560 square feet
* 160 perches. A perch is equal to a square rod (1 square rod is 0.00625 acre)
* 4 roods
* A furlong by a chain (furlong 220 yards, chain 22 yards)
* 40 rods by 4 rods, 160 rods2 (historically fencing was often sold in 40 rod lengths)
* (0.0015625) square mile (1 square mile is equal to 640 acres)

Perhaps the easiest way for US residents to envision an acre is as a rectangle measuring 88 yards by 55 yards ( of 880 yards by of 880 yards), about the size of a standard American football field. To be more exact, one acre is 90.75% of a 100-yd-long by 53.33-yd-wide American football field (without the end zone). The full field, including the end zones, covers about .

For residents of other countries, the acre might be envisioned as rather more than half of a football pitch.

== Historical origin ==

The word acre is derived from the Norman, attested for the first time in a text of Fécamp in 1006 to the meaning of «agrarian measure». Acre dates back to the old Scandinavian akr “cultivated field, ploughed land” which is perpetuated in Icelandic and the Faroese “field (wheat)”, Norwegian and Swedish , Danish “field”, cognate with German , Dutch , Latin , Sanskrit , and Greek (). In English, an obsolete variant spelling was &quot;&quot;.

According to the Act on the Composition of Yards and Perches, dating from around 1300, an acre is &quot;40 perches rods] in length and four in breadth&quot;, meaning 220 yards by 22 yards. As detailed in the diagram, an acre was roughly the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day.

Before the enactment of the metric system, many countries in Europe used their own official acres. In France, the traditional unit of area was the &quot;arpent carré&quot;, a measure based on the Roman system of land measurement.
The was used only in Normandy (and neighbouring places outside its traditional borders), but its value varied greatly across Normandy, ranging from 3,632 to 9,725 square metres, with 8,172 square metres being the most frequent value. But inside the same of Normandy, for instance in pays de Caux, the farmers (still in the 20th century) made the difference between the (68 ares, 66 centiares) and the (56 to 65 ca). The Normandy was usually divided in 4 (roods) and 160 square , like the English acre.

The Normandy was equal to 1.6 , the unit of area more commonly used in Northern France outside of Normandy. In Canada, the Paris used in Quebec before the metric system was adopted is sometimes called &quot;French acre&quot; in English, even though the Paris and the Normandy were two very different units of area in ancient France (the Paris became the unit of area of French Canada, whereas the Normandy was never used in French Canada).

In Germany, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe the traditional unit of area was . Like the acre, the &quot;morgen&quot; was a unit of ploughland, representing a strip that could be ploughed by one man and an ox or horse in a morning. There were many variants of the &quot;morgen&quot;, differing between the different German territories, ranging from . It was also used in Old Prussia, in the Balkans, Norway, and Denmark, where it was equal to about .

Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and subsequently the United Kingdom, by acts of:
* Edward I
* Edward III
* Henry VIII
* George IV
* Queen Victoria – the British Weights and Measures Act of 1878 defined it as containing 4,840 square yards.

Historically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, roods, and perches), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000 acres of land, not 50 square miles of land.

The acre is related to the square mile, with 640 acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280 feet (1760 yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of mile (880 yards) and is square mile in area, or 160 acres. These subunits are typically then again divided into quarters, with each side being mile long, and being of a square mile in area, or 40 acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase &quot;the back 40&quot; refers to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the Canadian Prairie Provinces and the US Midwest are on square-mile grids for surveying purposes.

==Legacy units==
* Customary acre – The customary acre was roughly similar to the Imperial acre, but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation in carucates, virgates, bovates, nooks, and farundels. These may have been multiples of the customary acre, rather than the statute acre.
* Builder&#x27;s acre = an even or , used in US real-estate development to simplify the math and for marketing. It is nearly 10% smaller than a survey acre, and the discrepancy has led to lawsuits alleging misrepresentation.
* Feddan - Middle Eastern measurement unit, .
* Scottish acre = 1.3 Imperial acres (5,080 m2, an obsolete Scottish measurement)
* Irish acre = 
* Cheshire acre = 
* Stremma or Greek acre ≈ 10,000 square Greek feet, but now set at exactly 1,000 square metres (a similar unit was the zeugarion)
* Dunam or Turkish acre ≈ 1,600 square Turkish paces, but now set at exactly 1,000 square metres (a similar unit was the çift)
* Actus quadratus or Roman acre ≈ 14,400 square Roman feet (about 1,260 square metres)
* God&#x27;s Acre – a synonym for a churchyard.
* Long acre the grass strip on either side of a road that may be used for illicit grazing.
* Town acre was a term used in early 19th century in the planning of towns on a grid plan, such as Adelaide, South Australia and Wellington, New Plymouth and Nelson in New Zealand. The land was divided into plots of an Imperial acre, and these became known as town acres.

<doc id="1800" wikidata="Q80863" url="?curid=1800" title="Adenosine triphosphate">
<text>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleoside triphosphate that provides energy to drive and support many processes in living cells, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis. Found in all known forms of life, it is often referred to as the &quot;molecular unit of currency&quot; for intracellular energy transfer.

When consumed in a metabolic process, ATP converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP. It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA, and is used as a coenzyme. An average adult human processes around 50 kilograms (about 100 moles) daily.

From the perspective of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate.

==Structure==
ATP consists of an adenine attached by the #9-nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a sugar (ribose), which in turn is attached at the 5&#x27; carbon atom of the sugar to a triphosphate group. In its many reactions related to metabolism, the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged, but the triphosphate is converted to di- and monophosphate, giving respectively the derivatives ADP and AMP. The three phosphoryl groups are labeled as alpha (α), beta (β), and, for the terminal phosphate, gamma (γ).

In neutral solution, ionized ATP exists mostly as ATP4−, with a small proportion of ATP3−.

===Metal cation binding===
Polyanionic and featuring a potentially chelating polyphosphate group, ATP binds metal cations with high affinity. The binding constant for is (). The binding of a divalent cation, almost always magnesium, strongly affects the interaction of ATP with various proteins. Due to the strength of the ATP-Mg2+ interaction, ATP exists in the cell mostly as a complex with bonded to the phosphate oxygen centers.

A second magnesium ion is critical for ATP binding in the kinase domain. The presence of Mg2+ regulates kinase activity. It is interesting from an RNA world perspective that ATP can carry a Mg ion which catalyzes RNA polymerization.

==Chemical properties==
Salts of ATP can be isolated as colorless solids.
ATP is stable in aqueous solutions between pH 6.8 and 7.4 (in the absence of catalysts). At more extreme pH levels, it rapidly hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate. Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium, with ATP concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of ADP. In the context of biochemical reactions, the P-O-P bonds are frequently referred to as &quot;high-energy bonds&quot;.

==Reactive aspects==
The hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate

:ATP(aq) + (l) = ADP(aq) + HPO(aq) + H(aq)

releases of enthalpy. This may differ under physiological conditions if the reactant and products are not exactly in these ionization states. The values of the free energy released by cleaving either a phosphate (Pi) or a pyrophosphate (PPi) unit from ATP at standard state concentrations of 1 mol/L at pH 7 are:

:ATP + → ADP + Pi Δ&quot;G&quot;°&#x27; = −30.5 kJ/mol (−7.3 kcal/mol)
:ATP + → AMP + PPi Δ&quot;G&quot;°&#x27; = −45.6 kJ/mol (−10.9 kcal/mol)
These abbreviated equations at a pH near 7 can be written more explicitly (R = adenosyl):
:[RO-P(O)2-O-P(O)2-O-PO3]4− + → [RO-P(O)2-O-PO3]3− + [HPO4]2− + H+
:[RO-P(O)2-O-P(O)2-O-PO3]4− + → [RO-PO3]2− + [HO3P-O-PO3]3− + H+

At cytoplasmic conditions, where the ADP/ATP ratio is 10 orders of magnitude from equilibrium, the Δ&quot;G&quot; is around −57 kJ/mol.

Along with pH, the free energy change of ATP hydrolysis is also associated with Mg2+ concentration, from ΔG°&#x27; = −35.7 kJ/mol at a Mg2+ concentration of zero, to ΔG°&#x27; = −31 kJ/mol at [Mg2+] = 5 mM. Higher concentrations of Mg2+ decrease free energy released in the reaction due to binding of Mg2+ ions to negatively charged oxygen atoms of ATP at pH 7.

==Production from AMP and ADP==
===Production, aerobic conditions===
A typical intracellular concentration of ATP may be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism.

ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose.

ATP production by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the mitochondria, which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell.

====Glycolysis====
In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are also produced, which can be oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.

Glycolysis is viewed as consisting of two phases with five steps each. In phase 1, &quot;the preparatory phase&quot;, glucose is converted to 2 d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (g3p). One ATP is invested in Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. Steps 1 and 3 of glycolysis are referred to as &quot;Priming Steps&quot;. In Phase 2, two equivalents of g3p are converted to two pyruvates. In Step 7, two ATP are produced. Also, in Step 10, two further equivalents of ATP are produced. In Steps 7 and 10, ATP is generated from ADP. A net of two ATPs is formed in the glycolysis cycle. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP.

=====Regulation=====
In glycolysis, hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP – the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate. 

====Citric acid cycle====
In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every &quot;turn&quot; of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl-CoA is converted to succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. NADH and FADH2 are recycled (to NAD+ and FAD, respectively) by oxidative phosphorylation, generating additional ATP. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2–3 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH2 yields between 1–2 equivalents of ATP. The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular oxygen, it is an obligately aerobic process because O2 is used to recycle the NADH and FADH2. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases.

The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion&#x27;s interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.

In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH2 through the electron transport chain releases the energy to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This pumping generates a proton motive force that is the net effect of a pH gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient – that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix – yields ATP by ATP synthase. Three ATP are produced per turn.

Although oxygen consumption appears fundamental for the maintenance of the proton motive force, in the event of oxygen shortage (hypoxia), intracellular acidosis (mediated by enhanced glycolytic rates and ATP hydrolysis), contributes to mitochondrial membrane potential and directly drives ATP synthesis.

Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. ATP outward movement is favored by the membrane&#x27;s electrochemical potential because the cytosol has a relatively positive charge compared to the relatively negative matrix. For every ATP transported out, it costs 1 H+. Producing one ATP costs about 3 H+. Therefore, making and exporting one ATP requires 4H+. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space.

=====Regulation=====
The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD+ to NADH and the concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphate, ATP, ADP, and AMP. Citrate – the ion that gives its name to the cycle – is a feedback inhibitor of citrate synthase and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis. 

====Beta oxidation====

In the presence of air and various cofactors and enzymes, fatty acids are converted to acetyl-CoA. The pathway is called beta-oxidation. Each cycle of beta-oxidation shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and produces one equivalent each of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH2. The acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, while the NADH and FADH2 are used by oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Dozens of ATP equivalents are generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain.

=====Regulation=====
In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase, which is regulated by the availability of its substrate – the reduced form of cytochrome c. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates:

:formula_1

which directly implies this equation:

:formula_2

Thus, a high ratio of [NADH] to [NAD+] or a high ratio of [ADP] [Pi] to [ATP] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity. An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm.

====Ketosis====
Ketone bodies can be used as fuels, yielding 22 ATP and 2 GTP molecules per acetoacetate molecule when oxidized in the mitochondria. Ketone bodies are transported from the liver to other tissues, where acetoacetate and &quot;beta&quot;-hydroxybutyrate can be reconverted to acetyl-CoA to produce reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2), via the citric acid cycle. Ketone bodies cannot be used as fuel by the liver, because the liver lacks the enzyme β-ketoacyl-CoA transferase, also called thiolase. Acetoacetate in low concentrations is taken up by the liver and undergoes detoxification through the methylglyoxal pathway which ends with lactate. Acetoacetate in high concentrations is absorbed by cells other than those in the liver and enters a different pathway via 1,2-propanediol. Though the pathway follows a different series of steps requiring ATP, 1,2-propanediol can be turned into pyruvate.

===Production, anaerobic conditions===
Fermentation is the metabolism of organic compounds in the absence of air. It involves substrate-level phosphorylation in the absence of a respiratory electron transport chain. The equation for the reaction of glucose to form lactic acid is:
: + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2  + 2 ATP + 2 

Anaerobic respiration is respiration in the absence of . Prokaryotes can utilize a variety of electron acceptors. These include nitrate, sulfate, and carbon dioxide.

====ATP replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate kinases====
ATP can also be synthesized through several so-called &quot;replenishment&quot; reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the family.

===ATP production during photosynthesis===
In plants, ATP is synthesized in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. The process is called photophosphorylation. The &quot;machinery&quot; is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force. ATP synthase then ensues exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation. Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the Calvin cycle, which produces triose sugars.

===ATP recycling===
The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 mol/L. The majority of ATP is recycled from ADP by the aforementioned processes. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + ADP remains fairly constant.

The energy used by human cells in an adult requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150 mol/L of ATP daily, which means a human will typically use their body weight worth of ATP over the course of the day. Each equivalent of ATP is recycled 1000–1500 times during a single day (), at approximately 9×1020 molecules/s.

==Biochemical functions==
===Intracellular signaling===
ATP is involved in signal transduction by serving as substrate for kinases, enzymes that transfer phosphate groups. Kinases are the most common ATP-binding proteins. They share a small number of common folds. Phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase can activate a cascade such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.

ATP is also a substrate of adenylate cyclase, most commonly in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to second messenger, cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.

===DNA and RNA synthesis===
ATP is one of four monomers required in the synthesis of RNA. The process is promoted by RNA polymerases. A similar process occurs in the formation of DNA, except that ATP is first converted to the deoxyribonucleotide dATP. Like many condensation reactions in nature, DNA replication and DNA transcription also consume ATP.

===Amino acid activation in protein synthesis===

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes consume ATP in the attachment tRNA to amino acids, forming aminoacyl-tRNA complexes. Aminoacyl transferase binds AMP-amino acid to tRNA. The coupling reaction proceeds in two steps:

# aa + ATP ⟶ aa-AMP + PPi
# aa-AMP + tRNA ⟶ aa-tRNA + AMP

The amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3′-end of the tRNA (the A in the sequence CCA) via an ester bond (roll over in illustration).

===ATP binding cassette transporter===
Transporting chemicals out of a cell against a gradient is often associated with ATP hydrolysis. Transport is mediated by ATP binding cassette transporters. The human genome encodes 48 ABC transporters, that are used for exporting drugs, lipids, and other compounds.

===Extracellular signalling and neurotransmission===
Cells secrete ATP to communicate with other cells in a process called purinergic signalling. ATP serves as a neurotransmitter in many parts of the nervous system, modulates ciliary beating, affects vascular oxygen supply etc. ATP is either secreted directly across the cell membrane through channel proteins or is pumped into vesicles which then fuse with the membrane. Cells detect ATP using the purinergic receptor proteins P2X and P2Y. ATP has been shown to be a critically important signalling molecule for microglia - neuron interactions in the adult brain, as well as during brain development. Furthermore, tissue-injury induced ATP-signalling is a major factor in rapid microglial phenotype changes.

=== Muscle contraction ===
ATP fuels muscle contractions. Muscle contractions are regulated by signaling pathways, although different muscle types being regulated by specific pathways and stimuli based on their particular function. However, in all muscle types, contraction is performed by the proteins actin and myosin.

ATP is initially bound to myosin. When ATPase hydrolyzes the bound ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate, myosin is positioned in a way that it can bind to actin. Myosin bound by ADP and Pi forms cross-bridges with actin and the subsequent release of ADP and Pi releases energy as the power stroke. The power stroke causes actin filament to slide past the myosin filament, shortening the muscle and causing a contraction. Another ATP molecule can then bind to myosin, releasing it from actin and allowing this process to repeat.

=== Protein solubility ===
ATP has recently been proposed to act as a biological hydrotrope and has been shown to affect proteome-wide solubility.

== Abiogenic origins ==
Acetyl phosphate (AcP), a precursor to ATP, can readily be synthesized at modest yields from thioacetate in pH 7 and 20 °C and pH 8 and 50 °C, although acetyl phosphate is less stable in warmer temperatures and alkaline conditions than in cooler and acidic to neutral conditions. It is unable to promote polymerization of ribonucleotides and amino acids and was only capable of phosphorylation of organic compounds. It was shown that it can promote aggregation and stabilization of AMP in the presence of Na+, aggregation of nucleotides could promote polymerization above 75 °C in the absence of Na+. It is possible that polymerization promoted by AcP could occur at mineral surfaces. It was shown that ADP can only be phosphorylated to ATP by AcP and other nucleoside triphosphates were not phosphorylated by AcP. This might explain why all lifeforms use ATP to drive biochemical reactions.

==ATP analogues==
Biochemistry laboratories often use &quot;in vitro&quot; studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.

Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions.

Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead, they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion.

Caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.

== Medical use ==
ATP is used intravenously for some heart-related conditions.

==History==
ATP was discovered in 1929 by and Jendrassik and, independently, by Cyrus Fiske and Yellapragada Subba Rao of Harvard Medical School, both teams competing against each other to find an assay for phosphorus.

It was proposed to be the intermediary between energy-yielding and energy-requiring reactions in cells by Fritz Albert Lipmann in 1941.

It was first synthesized in the laboratory by Alexander Todd in 1948, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1957 partly for this work.

The 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Peter Dennis Mitchell for the discovery of the chemiosmotic mechanism of ATP synthesis.

The 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was divided, one half jointly to Paul D. Boyer and John E. Walker &quot;for their elucidation of the enzymatic mechanism underlying the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&quot; and the other half to Jens C. Skou &quot;for the first discovery of an ion-transporting enzyme, Na+, K+ -ATPase.&quot;

<text>Ægir (anglicised as Aegir; Old Norse &#x27;sea&#x27;), Hlér (Old Norse &#x27;sea&#x27;), or Gymir (Old Norse less clearly &#x27;sea, engulfer&#x27;), is a jötunn and a personification of the sea in Norse mythology. In the Old Norse record, Ægir hosts the gods in his halls and is associated with brewing ale. Ægir is attested as married to a goddess, Rán, who also personifies the sea, and together the two produced daughters who personify waves, the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán, and Ægir&#x27;s son is Snær, personified snow. Ægir may also be the father of the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, wife of the god Freyr, or these may be two separate figures who share the same name (see below and Gymir (father of Gerðr)).

One of Ægir&#x27;s names, &quot;Hlér&quot;, is the namesake of the island Læsø (Old Norse &quot;Hlésey&quot; &#x27;Hlér&#x27;s island&#x27;) and perhaps also Lejre in Denmark. Scholars have long analyzed Ægir&#x27;s role in the Old Norse corpus, and the concept of the figure has had some influence in modern popular culture.

== Names ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Ægir&quot; (&#x27;sea&#x27;) may stem from a Proto-Germanic form &quot;*āgwi-jaz&quot; (&#x27;that of the river/water&#x27;), itself a derivative of the stem &quot;*ahwō-&quot; (&#x27;river&#x27;; cf. Gothic &quot;&quot; &#x27;body of water, river&#x27;, Old English &quot;ēa&quot; &#x27;stream&#x27;, Old High German &quot;aha&quot; &#x27;river&#x27;). Richard Cleasby and Guðbrandur Vigfússon saw his name as deriving from an ancient Indo-European root. Linguist Guus Kroonen argues that the Germanic stem &quot;*ahwō-&quot; is probably of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) origin, as it may be cognate with Latin &quot;aqua&quot; (via a common form &quot;*h₂ekʷ-eh₂-&quot;), and ultimately descend from the PIE root &quot;*h₂ep&quot;- (&#x27;water&#x27;; cf. Sanskrit &quot;áp-&quot; &#x27;water&#x27;, Tocharian &quot;āp-&quot; &#x27;water, river&#x27;). Linguist Michiel de Vaan notes that the connection between Proto-Germanic *&quot;ahwō&quot;- and Old Norse &quot;Ægir&quot; remains uncertain, and that *&quot;ahwō-&quot; and &quot;aqua&quot;, if cognates, may also be loanwords from a non-Indo-European language.

The name &quot;Ægir&quot; is identical to a noun for &#x27;sea&#x27; in skaldic poetry, itself a base word in many kennings. For instance, a ship is described as &quot;Ægir&#x27;s horse&quot; and the waves as the &quot;daughters of Ægir&quot;.

Poetic kennings in both &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot; (How Norway Was Settled) and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry) treat Ægir and the sea-jötunn Hlér, who lives on the Hlésey (&#x27;Hlér island&#x27;, modern Læsø), as the same figure.

The meaning of the Old Norse name &quot;Gymir&quot; is unclear. Proposed translations include &#x27;the earthly&#x27; (from Old Norse &quot;gumi&quot;), &#x27;the wintry one&#x27; (from &quot;gemla&quot;), or &#x27;the protector&#x27;, the &#x27;engulfer&#x27; (from &quot;geyma&quot;). (For more on this topic, see discussion below)

== Attestations ==

Ægir is attested in a variety of Old Norse sources.

===&quot;Sonatorrek&quot;===
Ægir and Rán receive mention in the poem &quot;Sonatorrek&quot; attributed to 10th century Icelandic skald Egill Skallagrímsson. In the poem, Egill laments the death of his son Böðvar, who drowned at sea during a storm. In one difficult stanza, the skald expresses the pain of losing his son by invoking the image of slaying the personified sea, personified as Ægir (Old Norse &quot;ǫlsmið[r]&quot; &#x27;ale-smith&#x27;) and Rán (&quot;Ægis man&quot; &#x27;Ægir&#x27;s wife&#x27;):
The skald later references Ægir by way of the kenning &#x27;Hlér&#x27;s fire&#x27; (&quot;Hlés viti&quot;), meaning gold.

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Ægir receives mention in the eddic poems &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;, &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, and in the prose section of &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;. In &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, the disguised god Odin references Ægir&#x27;s status as a renowned host among the gods:

:&#x27;Fleeting visions I have now revealed before the victory-gods&#x27;s sons,
:now the wished-for protection will awaken;
:to the all the Æsir it will become known,
:on Ægir&#x27;s benches,
:at Ægir&#x27;s feast.&#x27;

In &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;, Ægir plays a major role. In the poem, the gods have become thirsty after a successful hunt, and are keen to celebrate with drink. They &quot;shook the twigs and looked at the augury&quot; and &quot;found that at Ægir&#x27;s was an ample choice of cauldrons&quot;. Odin goes to Ægir, who he finds sitting in good cheer, and tells him he shall &quot;often prepare a feast for the Æsir&quot;. Referring to Ægir as a jötunn, the poem describes how, now annoyed, Ægir hatches a plan: He asks Thor to fetch a particular cauldron, and that with it he could brew ale for them all. The gods are unable to find a cauldron of a size big enough to meet Ægir&#x27;s request until the god Týr recommends one he knows of far away, setting the stage for the events of the rest of the poem.

According to the prose introduction to &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, &quot;Ægir, who is also called Gymir&quot;, was hosting a feast &quot;with the great cauldron which has just been told about&quot;, which many of the gods and elves attended. The prose introduction describes the feast as featuring gold that shimmers like fire light and ale that serves itself, and that &quot;it was a great place of peace&quot;. In attendance also were Ægir&#x27;s servers, Fimafeng and Eldir. The gods praise the excellence of their service and, hearing this, Loki murders Fimafeng, enraging the gods, who chase him out to the woods before returning to drink.

In the poem that follows the prose introduction (and in accompanying prose), Loki returns to the hall and greets Eldir: He says that before Eldir steps forward, he should first tell him what the gods are discussing in the hall. Eldir says that they&#x27;re discussing weaponry and war, and having nothing good to say about Loki. Loki says that he will enter Ægir&#x27;s halls and have a look at the feast, and with him bring quarrel and strife. Eldir notifies Loki that if he enters and causes trouble, he can expect them to return it to him. Loki enters the hall and the gods see him and become silent.

In &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;, a great wave is referred to as &quot;Ægir&#x27;s terrible daughter&quot;.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
Ægir receives numerous mentions in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, where he sits at a banquet and asks the skaldic god Bragi many questions, and Bragi responds with narratives about the gods. The section begins as follows:
Beyond this section of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Ægir receives several other mentions in kennings. Section 25 provides examples for &#x27;sea&#x27;, including &#x27;visitor of the gods&#x27;, &#x27;husband of Rán&#x27;, &#x27;father of Ægir&#x27;s daughters&#x27;, &#x27;land of Rán and Ægir&#x27;s daughters&#x27;. Kennings cited to skalds in this section include &#x27;the storm-happy daughters of Ægir&#x27; meaning &#x27;waves&#x27; (Svein) and a kenning in a fragment of a work by the 11th century Icelandic skald Hofgarða-Refr Gestsson, where Rán is referred to as &#x27;Gymir&#x27;s ... völva&#x27;:

The section&#x27;s author comments that the stanza &quot;[implies] that they are all the same, Ægir and Hler and Gymir.

Chapter 33b of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; discusses why skalds may refer to gold as &quot;Ægir&#x27;s fire&quot;. The section traces the kenning to a narrative surrounding Ægir, in which the jötunn employs &quot;glowing gold&quot; in the center of his hall to light it &quot;like fire&quot; (which the narrator compares to flaming swords in Valhalla). The section explains that &quot;Ran is the name of Ægir&#x27;s wife, and the names of their nine daughters are as was written above ... Then the Æsir discovered that Ran had a net in which she caught everyone that went to sea ... so this is the story of the origin of gold being called fire or light or brightness of Ægir, Ran or Ægir&#x27;s daughters, and from such kennings the practice has now developed of calling gold fire of the sea and of all terms for it, since Ægir and Ran&#x27;s names are also terms for the sea, and hence gold is now called fire of lakes or rivers and of all river-names.&quot;

In chapter 61 provides yet more kennings. Among them the author notes that &quot;Ran, who, it is said, was Ægir&#x27;s wife&quot; and that &quot;the daughters of Ægir and Ran are nine&quot;. In chapter 75, Ægir occurs in a list of jötnar.

===Saga corpus===
In what appears to be a Norwegian genealogical tradition, Ægir is portrayed as one of the three elements among the sea, the fire and the wind. The beginning of the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; (&#x27;Saga of the Orkney Islanders&#x27;) and &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdisk&quot; (&#x27;How Norway Was Settled&#x27;) tell that the jötunn king Fornjót had three sons: Hlér (&#x27;sea&#x27;), whom he called Ægir, a second named Logi (&#x27;fire&#x27;), and a third called Kári (&#x27;wind&#x27;).

==Scholarly reception and interpretation==
===Banquets===
Carolyne Larrington says that Ægir&#x27;s role in &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; &quot;may reflect Scandinavian royal practices in which the king enforces his authority on his subordinates by visiting their homes and demanding to be feasted&quot;. According to Andy Orchard, Ægir&#x27;s role in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, where he attends a banquet rather than hosting it, could be a deliberate inversion of the traditional motif of Ægir as host.

===Gymir===
The name &quot;Gymir&quot; may indicate that Ægir was understood as the father of the beautiful jötunn Gerðr; they may also have been two different figures sharing the same name (see Gymir, father of Gerðr). Both the prose introduction to &quot;Lokasenna&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; state that Ægir is also known as &quot;Gymir&quot;, the father of the jötunn Gerðr. Rudolf Simek argues that, if understood to be two different entities, this may stem from an erroneous interpretation of kennings in which different jötunn-names are used interchangeably.

===Hlér, Læsø, Lejre, and Snow ===
As highlighted above in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, the name of the island Læsø in Denmark references Hlér (Old Norse &quot;Hléysey&quot; &#x27;Hlér&#x27;s Island&#x27;). Simek speculates that Hlér may therefore have been seen as something of an ancestor of the island.

Two sources list the personified snow, Snær (Old Norse &#x27;snow&#x27;), as Hlér&#x27;s son. Book nine of Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s 12th century history of Denmark &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; contains mention of a figure by the name of &quot;Lerus&quot; (from Old Norse &quot;Hlér&quot;) whose son is &quot;Snio&quot; (from Old Norse &quot;Snær&quot; &#x27;Snow&#x27;). The Danish chronicle of Lejre, &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; also connects the two, and the name &quot;Lejre&quot; may, like &quot;Læsø&quot;, derive from the jötunn.

===Jötunn===
Scholars have often discussed Ægir&#x27;s role as host to the gods and his description as a jötunn. Anthony Faulkes observes that Ægir is &quot;often described by modern writers as god of the sea&quot; yet that he is nowhere described as a god in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and appears in a list of jötnar in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. According to John Lindow, since his wife Rán is listed among the Ásynjur (goddesses) in the same part of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and since he had a close and friendly relationship with the Æsir (gods), Ægir&#x27;s description as a jötunn appears questionable. Andy Orchard argues on the contrary that Ægir&#x27;s inclusion among the Æsir is probably a late development since his daughters are described as jötnar and some sources mention him as the descendant of the jötunn Fornjót. According to Rudolf Simek, while attested as a jötunn, Ægir &quot;has characteristics&quot; of a sea god.

==Modern influence==

Ægir has been the subject of a variety of art pieces. These include Nils Blommér&#x27;s painting &quot;Näcken och Ägirs döttrar&quot; (1850), Johan Peter Molin&#x27;s (d. 1874) fountain relief &quot;Ægir&quot;, and Emil Doepler&#x27;s &quot;Ægir&quot; (1901).

Ægir is referenced in a variety of others ways in modern popular culture. For example, Shoto Todoroki from the Japanese anime &quot;Boku no hero academia&quot; has a move titled &quot;Great Glacial Aegir&quot;. He is also the namesake of a Norwegian corvette produced in 1967 (&quot;Ægir&quot;), a coastal defense ship in the Imperial German Navy, and of an exoplanet, Epsilon Eridani b.

<text>An antibiotic is a type of antimicrobial substance active against bacteria. It is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections, and antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections. They may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. A limited number of antibiotics also possess antiprotozoal activity. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the ones which cause the common cold or influenza. Drugs which inhibit growth of viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals. Antibiotics are also not effective against fungi. Drugs which inhibit growth of fungi are called antifungal drugs.

Sometimes, the term &quot;antibiotic&quot;—literally &quot;opposing life&quot;, from the Greek roots ἀντι &quot;anti&quot;, &quot;against&quot; and βίος &quot;bios&quot;, &quot;life&quot;—is broadly used to refer to any substance used against microbes, but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as penicillin) are those produced naturally (by one microorganism fighting another), whereas non-antibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics) are fully synthetic. However, both classes have the same effect of killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms, and both are included in antimicrobial chemotherapy. &quot;Antibacterials&quot; include bactericides, bacteriostatics, antibacterial soaps, and chemical disinfectants, whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine and sometimes in livestock feed.

Antibiotics have been used since ancient times. Many civilizations used topical application of moldy bread, with many references to its beneficial effects arising from ancient Egypt, Nubia, China, Serbia, Greece, and Rome. The first person to directly document the use of molds to treat infections was John Parkinson (1567–1650). Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century. Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. Alexander Fleming (1881–1955) discovered modern day penicillin in 1928, the widespread use of which proved significantly beneficial during wartime. The first sulfonamide and the first active antibacterial drug, Prontosil, was developed by a research team led by Gerhard Domagk in 1932 or 1933 at the Bayer Laboratories of the IG Farben conglomerate in Germany. However, the effectiveness and easy access to antibiotics have also led to their overuse and some bacteria have evolved resistance to them. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a naturally occurring process, is driven largely by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials. Yet, at the same time, many people around the world do not have access to essential antimicrobials. The World Health Organization has classified AMR as a widespread &quot;serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country&quot;. Each year, nearly 5 million deaths are associated with AMR globally. Global deaths attributable to AMR numbered 1.27 million in 2019.

==Etymology==

The term &#x27;antibiosis&#x27;, meaning &quot;against life&quot;, was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;. These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist, in 1947.

The term &quot;antibiotic&quot; was first used in 1942 by Selman Waksman and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution. This definition excluded substances that kill bacteria but that are not produced by microorganisms (such as gastric juices and hydrogen peroxide). It also excluded synthetic antibacterial compounds such as the sulfonamides. In current usage, the term &quot;antibiotic&quot; is applied to any medication that kills bacteria or inhibits their growth, regardless of whether that medication is produced by a microorganism or not.

The term &quot;antibiotic&quot; derives from &quot;anti&quot; + βιωτικός (&quot;biōtikos&quot;), &quot;fit for life, lively&quot;, which comes from βίωσις (&quot;biōsis&quot;), &quot;way of life&quot;, and that from βίος (&quot;bios&quot;), &quot;life&quot;. The term &quot;antibacterial&quot; derives from Greek ἀντί (&quot;anti&quot;), &quot;against&quot; + βακτήριον (&quot;baktērion&quot;), diminutive of βακτηρία (&quot;baktēria&quot;), &quot;staff, cane&quot;, because the first bacteria to be discovered were rod-shaped.

==Usage==
===Medical uses===
Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent bacterial infections, and sometimes protozoan infections. (Metronidazole is effective against a number of parasitic diseases). When an infection is suspected of being responsible for an illness but the responsible pathogen has not been identified, an empiric therapy is adopted. This involves the administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic based on the signs and symptoms presented and is initiated pending laboratory results that can take several days.

When the responsible pathogenic microorganism is already known or has been identified, definitive therapy can be started. This will usually involve the use of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. The choice of antibiotic given will also be based on its cost. Identification is critically important as it can reduce the cost and toxicity of the antibiotic therapy and also reduce the possibility of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. To avoid surgery, antibiotics may be given for non-complicated acute appendicitis.

Antibiotics may be given as a preventive measure and this is usually limited to at-risk populations such as those with a weakened immune system (particularly in HIV cases to prevent pneumonia), those taking immunosuppressive drugs, cancer patients, and those having surgery. Their use in surgical procedures is to help prevent infection of incisions. They have an important role in dental antibiotic prophylaxis where their use may prevent bacteremia and consequent infective endocarditis. Antibiotics are also used to prevent infection in cases of neutropenia particularly cancer-related.

The use of antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease is not supported by current scientific evidence, and may actually increase cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality and the occurrence of stroke.

===Routes of administration===
There are many different routes of administration for antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics are usually taken by mouth. In more severe cases, particularly deep-seated systemic infections, antibiotics can be given intravenously or by injection. Where the site of infection is easily accessed, antibiotics may be given topically in the form of eye drops onto the conjunctiva for conjunctivitis or ear drops for ear infections and acute cases of swimmer&#x27;s ear. Topical use is also one of the treatment options for some skin conditions including acne and cellulitis. Advantages of topical application include achieving high and sustained concentration of antibiotic at the site of infection; reducing the potential for systemic absorption and toxicity, and total volumes of antibiotic required are reduced, thereby also reducing the risk of antibiotic misuse. Topical antibiotics applied over certain types of surgical wounds have been reported to reduce the risk of surgical site infections. However, there are certain general causes for concern with topical administration of antibiotics. Some systemic absorption of the antibiotic may occur; the quantity of antibiotic applied is difficult to accurately dose, and there is also the possibility of local hypersensitivity reactions or contact dermatitis occurring. It is recommended to administer antibiotics as soon as possible, especially in life-threatening infections. Many emergency departments stock antibiotics for this purpose.

===Global consumption===
Antibiotic consumption varies widely between countries. The WHO report on surveillance of antibiotic consumption published in 2018 analysed 2015 data from 65 countries. As measured in defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day. Mongolia had the highest consumption with a rate of 64.4. Burundi had the lowest at 4.4. Amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were the most frequently consumed.

==Side effects==

Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects before their approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and well tolerated. However, some antibiotics have been associated with a wide extent of adverse side effects ranging from mild to very severe depending on the type of antibiotic used, the microbes targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity or allergic reactions. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis.

Common side effects of oral antibiotics include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;. Taking probiotics during the course of antibiotic treatment can help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus &quot;Candida&quot; in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as the possibility of tendon damage from the administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid.

Some antibiotics may also damage the mitochondrion, a bacteria-derived organelle found in eukaryotic, including human, cells. Mitochondrial damage cause oxidative stress in cells and has been suggested as a mechanism for side effects from fluoroquinolones. They are also known to affect chloroplasts.

== Interactions ==

===Birth control pills===
There are few well-controlled studies on whether antibiotic use increases the risk of oral contraceptive failure. The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do not interfere with birth control pills, such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%). Situations that may increase the risk of oral contraceptive failure include non-compliance (missing taking the pill), vomiting, or diarrhea. Gastrointestinal disorders or interpatient variability in oral contraceptive absorption affecting ethinylestradiol serum levels in the blood. Women with menstrual irregularities may be at higher risk of failure and should be advised to use backup contraception during antibiotic treatment and for one week after its completion. If patient-specific risk factors for reduced oral contraceptive efficacy are suspected, backup contraception is recommended.

In cases where antibiotics have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills, such as for the broad-spectrum antibiotic rifampicin, these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes&#x27; causing increased breakdown of the pill&#x27;s active ingredients. Effects on the intestinal flora, which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon, have also been suggested, but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial. Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibiotics that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives. More studies on the possible interactions between antibiotics and birth control pills (oral contraceptives) are required as well as careful assessment of patient-specific risk factors for potential oral contractive pill failure prior to dismissing the need for backup contraception.

===Alcohol===
Interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. While moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side effects. Therefore, potential risks of side effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered.

Antibiotics such as metronidazole, tinidazole, cephamandole, latamoxef, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, and furazolidone, cause a disulfiram-like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which may result in vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath. In addition, the efficacy of doxycycline and erythromycin succinate may be reduced by alcohol consumption. Other effects of alcohol on antibiotic activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibiotic compound.

==Pharmacodynamics==

The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors. These include host defense mechanisms, the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial. The bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells. These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection. Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration, &quot;in vitro&quot; characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial.
To predict clinical outcome, the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its pharmacokinetic profile, and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy.

===Combination therapy===

In important infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, combination therapy (i.e., the concurrent application of two or more antibiotics) has been used to delay or prevent the emergence of resistance. In acute bacterial infections, antibiotics as part of combination therapy are prescribed for their synergistic effects to improve treatment outcome as the combined effect of both antibiotics is better than their individual effect. Fosfomycin has the highest number of synergistic combinations among antibiotics and is almost always used as a partner drug. Methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; infections may be treated with a combination therapy of fusidic acid and rifampicin. Antibiotics used in combination may also be antagonistic and the combined effects of the two antibiotics may be less than if one of the antibiotics was given as a monotherapy. For example, chloramphenicol and tetracyclines are antagonists to penicillins. However, this can vary depending on the species of bacteria. In general, combinations of a bacteriostatic antibiotic and bactericidal antibiotic are antagonistic.

In addition to combining one antibiotic with another, antibiotics are sometimes co-administered with resistance-modifying agents. For example, β-lactam antibiotics may be used in combination with β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid or sulbactam, when a patient is infected with a β-lactamase-producing strain of bacteria.

==Classes==


Antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes. Those that target the bacterial cell wall (penicillins and cephalosporins) or the cell membrane (polymyxins), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (rifamycins, lipiarmycins, quinolones, and sulfonamides) have bactericidal activities, killing the bacteria. Protein synthesis inhibitors (macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracyclines) are usually bacteriostatic, inhibiting further growth (with the exception of bactericidal aminoglycosides). Further categorization is based on their target specificity. &quot;Narrow-spectrum&quot; antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as gram-negative or gram-positive, whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year break in discovering classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibiotics were introduced to clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic lipopeptides (such as daptomycin), glycylcyclines (such as tigecycline), oxazolidinones (such as linezolid), and lipiarmycins (such as fidaxomicin).

==Production==

With advances in medicinal chemistry, most modern antibacterials are semisynthetic modifications of various natural compounds. These include, for example, the beta-lactam antibiotics, which include the penicillins (produced by fungi in the genus &quot;Penicillium&quot;), the cephalosporins, and the carbapenems. Compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the aminoglycosides, whereas other antibacterials—for example, the sulfonamides, the quinolones, and the oxazolidinones—are produced solely by chemical synthesis. Many antibacterial compounds are relatively small molecules with a molecular weight of less than 1000 daltons.

Since the first pioneering efforts of Howard Florey and Chain in 1939, the importance of antibiotics, including antibacterials, to medicine has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales. Following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria, production of the active compounds is carried out using fermentation, usually in strongly conditions.

==Resistance==

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR or AR) is a naturally occurring process. AMR is driven largely by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials. Yet, at the same time, many people around the world do not have access to essential antimicrobials. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a common phenomenon mainly caused by the overuse/misuse. It represents a threat to health globally. Each year, nearly 5 million deaths are associated with AMR globally.

Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug. For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria–Delbrück experiment. Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.

Resistance may take the form of biodegradation of pharmaceuticals, such as sulfamethazine-degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces.
The survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance, but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use.

Antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost, thereby reducing fitness of resistant strains, which can limit the spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria, for example, in the absence of antibacterial compounds. Additional mutations, however, may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria.

Paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms. Useful antibiotic targets are those for which mutations negatively impact bacterial reproduction or viability.

Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.

Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as &quot;superbugs&quot;, now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were, for a while, well controlled. For example, emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide. For example, NDM-1 is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials. The United Kingdom&#x27;s Health Protection Agency has stated that &quot;most isolates with NDM-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections.&quot; On 26 May 2016, an &quot;E. coli&quot; &quot;superbug&quot; was identified in the United States resistant to colistin, &quot;the last line of defence&quot; antibiotic.
In recent years, even anaerobic bacteria, historically considered less concerning in terms of resistance, have demonstrated high rates of antibiotic resistance, particularly &quot;Bacteroides&quot;, for which resistance rates to penicillin have been reported to exceed 90%.

===Misuse===


Per &quot;The ICU Book&quot;, &quot;The first rule of antibiotics is to try not to use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them.&quot; Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, potential harm from antibiotics extends beyond selection of antimicrobial resistance and their overuse is associated with adverse effects for patients themselves, seen most clearly in critically ill patients in Intensive care units. Self-prescribing of antibiotics is an example of misuse. Many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment. Also, incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections. The overuse of antibiotics, like penicillin and erythromycin, has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s. Widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics.

Common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of prophylactic antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient&#x27;s weight and history of prior use. Other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic, incorrect dosage and administration, or failure to rest for sufficient recovery. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment, for example, is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the common cold. One study on respiratory tract infections found &quot;physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them&quot;. Multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. The lack of rapid point of care diagnostic tests, particularly in resource-limited settings is considered one of the drivers of antibiotic misuse.

Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics. The issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the US Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance. This task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance, and is coordinated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health, as well as other US agencies. A non-governmental organization campaign group is &quot;Keep Antibiotics Working&quot;. In France, an &quot;Antibiotics are not automatic&quot; government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, especially in children.

The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the European Union has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (including the World Health Organization, the National Academy of Sciences, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) have advocated restricting the amount of antibiotic use in food animal production. However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses&#x27; Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association.

Despite pledges by food companies and restaurants to reduce or eliminate meat that comes from animals treated with antibiotics, the purchase of antibiotics for use on farm animals has been increasing every year.

There has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry. In the United States, the question of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to use of antibiotics in livestock was raised by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977. In March 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling in an action brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock, which violated FDA regulations.

Studies have shown that common misconceptions about the effectiveness and necessity of antibiotics to treat common mild illnesses contribute to their overuse.

Other forms of antibiotic-associated harm include anaphylaxis, drug toxicity most notably kidney and liver damage, and super-infections with resistant organisms. Antibiotics are also known to affect mitochondrial function, and this may contribute to the bioenergetic failure of immune cells seen in sepsis. They also alter the microbiome of the gut, lungs, and skin, which may be associated with adverse effects such as Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhoea. Whilst antibiotics can clearly be lifesaving in patients with bacterial infections, their overuse, especially in patients where infections are hard to diagnose, can lead to harm via multiple mechanisms.

==History==
Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2,000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected mold and plant materials to treat infections. Nubian mummies studied in the 1990s were found to contain significant levels of tetracycline. The beer brewed at that time was conjectured to have been the source.

The use of antibiotics in modern medicine began with the discovery of synthetic antibiotics derived from dyes. Various Essential oils have been shown to have anti-microbial properties. Along with this, the plants from which these oils have been derived can be used as niche anti-microbial agents.

===Synthetic antibiotics derived from dyes===

Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted certain dyes would colour human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, in 1907, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the first synthetic antibacterial organoarsenic compound salvarsan, now called arsphenamine.

This heralded the era of antibacterial treatment that was begun with the discovery of a series of arsenic-derived synthetic antibiotics by both Alfred Bertheim and Ehrlich in 1907. Ehrlich and Bertheim had experimented with various chemicals derived from dyes to treat trypanosomiasis in mice and spirochaeta infection in rabbits. While their early compounds were too toxic, Ehrlich and Sahachiro Hata, a Japanese bacteriologist working with Ehrlich in the quest for a drug to treat syphilis, achieved success with the 606th compound in their series of experiments. In 1910, Ehrlich and Hata announced their discovery, which they called drug &quot;606&quot;, at the Congress for Internal Medicine at Wiesbaden. The Hoechst company began to market the compound toward the end of 1910 under the name Salvarsan, now known as arsphenamine. The drug was used to treat syphilis in the first half of the 20th century. In 1908, Ehrlich received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to immunology. Hata was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 and for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1912 and 1913.

The first sulfonamide and the first active antibacterial drug, Prontosil, was developed by a research team led by Gerhard Domagk in 1932 or 1933 at the Bayer Laboratories of the IG Farben conglomerate in Germany, for which Domagk received the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Sulfanilamide, the active drug of Prontosil, was not patentable as it had already been in use in the dye industry for some years. Prontosil had a relatively broad effect against Gram-positive cocci, but not against enterobacteria. Research was stimulated apace by its success. The discovery and development of this sulfonamide drug opened the era of antibacterials.

===Penicillin and other natural antibiotics===
Observations about the growth of some microorganisms inhibiting the growth of other microorganisms have been reported since the late 19th century. These observations of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials. Louis Pasteur observed, &quot;if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics&quot;.

In 1874, physician Sir William Roberts noted that cultures of the mould &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot; that is used in the making of some types of blue cheese did not display bacterial contamination.

In 1895 Vincenzo Tiberio, Italian physician, published a paper on the antibacterial power of some extracts of mold.

In 1897, doctoral student Ernest Duchesne submitted a dissertation, &quot;&quot; (Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes), the first known scholarly work to consider the therapeutic capabilities of moulds resulting from their anti-microbial activity. In his thesis, Duchesne proposed that bacteria and moulds engage in a perpetual battle for survival. Duchesne observed that &quot;E. coli&quot; was eliminated by &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot; when they were both grown in the same culture. He also observed that when he inoculated laboratory animals with lethal doses of typhoid bacilli together with &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot;, the animals did not contract typhoid. Duchesne&#x27;s army service after getting his degree prevented him from doing any further research. Duchesne died of tuberculosis, a disease now treated by antibiotics.

In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming postulated the existence of penicillin, a molecule produced by certain moulds that kills or stops the growth of certain kinds of bacteria. Fleming was working on a culture of disease-causing bacteria when he noticed the spores of a green mold, &quot;Penicillium rubens&quot;, in one of his culture plates. He observed that the presence of the mould killed or prevented the growth of the bacteria. Fleming postulated that the mould must secrete an antibacterial substance, which he named penicillin in 1928. Fleming believed that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterised some of its biological properties, and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections, but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists.

Ernst Chain, Howard Florey and Edward Abraham succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, penicillin G, in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. Later, Norman Heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was first proposed by Abraham in 1942 and then later confirmed by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. (see below) The development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Chain and Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming.

Florey credited René Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey&#x27;s research in penicillin. In 1939, coinciding with the start of World War II, Dubos had reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, tyrothricin, a compound of 20% gramicidin and 80% tyrocidine, from &quot;Bacillus brevis&quot;. It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II. Gramicidin, however, could not be used systemically because of toxicity. Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage. Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the Axis and the Allied powers during World War II and limited access during the Cold War.

===Late 20th century===
During the mid-20th century, the number of new antibiotic substances introduced for medical use increased significantly. From 1935 to 1968, 12 new classes were launched. However, after this, the number of new classes dropped markedly, with only two new classes introduced between 1969 and 2003.

==Antibiotic pipeline==
Both the WHO and the Infectious Disease Society of America report that the weak antibiotic pipeline does not match bacteria&#x27;s increasing ability to develop resistance. The Infectious Disease Society of America report noted that the number of new antibiotics approved for marketing per year had been declining and identified seven antibiotics against the Gram-negative bacilli currently in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials. However, these drugs did not address the entire spectrum of resistance of Gram-negative bacilli. According to the WHO fifty one new therapeutic entities - antibiotics (including combinations), are in phase 1–3 clinical trials as of May 2017. Antibiotics targeting multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens remains a high priority.

A few antibiotics have received marketing authorization in the last seven years. The cephalosporin ceftaroline and the lipoglycopeptides oritavancin and telavancin have been approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. The lipoglycopeptide dalbavancin and the oxazolidinone tedizolid has also been approved for use for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection. The first in a new class of narrow-spectrum macrocyclic antibiotics, fidaxomicin, has been approved for the treatment of &quot;C. difficile&quot; colitis. New cephalosporin-lactamase inhibitor combinations also approved include ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-avibactam for complicated urinary tract infection and intra-abdominal infection.

Possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by FDA. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. In the US, the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act was introduced with the aim of fast tracking the drug development of antibiotics to combat the growing threat of &#x27;superbugs&#x27;. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, &#x27;Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms&#x27; or &#x27;breakpoints&#x27;, will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, &quot;By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA&#x27;s authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.&quot;

=== Replenishing the antibiotic pipeline and developing other new therapies ===
Because antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains continue to emerge and spread, there is a constant need to develop new antibacterial treatments. Current strategies include traditional chemistry-based approaches such as natural product-based drug discovery, newer chemistry-based approaches such as drug design, traditional biology-based approaches such as immunoglobulin therapy, and experimental biology-based approaches such as phage therapy, fecal microbiota transplants, antisense RNA-based treatments, and CRISPR-Cas9-based treatments.

==== Natural product-based antibiotic discovery ====
Most of the antibiotics in current use are natural products or natural product derivatives, and bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are being screened in the search for new antibiotics. Organisms may be selected for testing based on ecological, ethnomedical, genomic, or historical rationales. Medicinal plants, for example, are screened on the basis that they are used by traditional healers to prevent or cure infection and may therefore contain antibacterial compounds. Also, soil bacteria are screened on the basis that, historically, they have been a very rich source of antibiotics (with 70 to 80% of antibiotics in current use derived from the actinomycetes).

In addition to screening natural products for direct antibacterial activity, they are sometimes screened for the ability to suppress antibiotic resistance and antibiotic tolerance. For example, some secondary metabolites inhibit drug efflux pumps, thereby increasing the concentration of antibiotic able to reach its cellular target and decreasing bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Natural products known to inhibit bacterial efflux pumps include the alkaloid lysergol, the carotenoids capsanthin and capsorubin, and the flavonoids rotenone and chrysin. Other natural products, this time primary metabolites rather than secondary metabolites, have been shown to eradicate antibiotic tolerance. For example, glucose, mannitol, and fructose reduce antibiotic tolerance in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, rendering them more susceptible to killing by aminoglycoside antibiotics.

Natural products may be screened for the ability to suppress bacterial virulence factors too. Virulence factors are molecules, cellular structures and regulatory systems that enable bacteria to evade the body&#x27;s immune defenses (e.g. urease, staphyloxanthin), move towards, attach to, and/or invade human cells (e.g. type IV pili, adhesins, internalins), coordinate the activation of virulence genes (e.g. quorum sensing), and cause disease (e.g. exotoxins). Examples of natural products with antivirulence activity include the flavonoid epigallocatechin gallate (which inhibits listeriolysin O), the quinone tetrangomycin (which inhibits staphyloxanthin), and the sesquiterpene zerumbone (which inhibits &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot; motility).

==== Immunoglobulin therapy ====

Antibodies (anti-tetanus immunoglobulin) have been used in the treatment and prevention of tetanus since the 1910s, and this approach continues to be a useful way of controlling bacterial diseases. The monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab, for example, has been approved by the US FDA and EMA for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, and other monoclonal antibodies are in development (e.g. AR-301 for the adjunctive treatment of &quot;S. aureus&quot; ventilator-associated pneumonia). Antibody treatments act by binding to and neutralizing bacterial exotoxins and other virulence factors.

==== Phage therapy ====
Phage therapy is under investigation as a method of treating antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Phage therapy involves infecting bacterial pathogens with viruses. Bacteriophages and their host ranges are extremely specific for certain bacteria, thus, unlike antibiotics, they do not disturb the host organism&#x27;s intestinal microbiota. Bacteriophages, also known as phages, infect and kill bacteria primarily during lytic cycles. Phages insert their DNA into the bacterium, where it is transcribed and used to make new phages, after which the cell will lyse, releasing new phage that are able to infect and destroy further bacteria of the same strain. The high specificity of phage protects &quot;good&quot; bacteria from destruction.

Some disadvantages to the use of bacteriophages also exist, however. Bacteriophages may harbour virulence factors or toxic genes in their genomes and, prior to use, it may be prudent to identify genes with similarity to known virulence factors or toxins by genomic sequencing. In addition, the oral and IV administration of phages for the eradication of bacterial infections poses a much higher safety risk than topical application. Also, there is the additional concern of uncertain immune responses to these large antigenic cocktails.

There are considerable regulatory hurdles that must be cleared for such therapies. Despite numerous challenges, the use of bacteriophages as a replacement for antimicrobial agents against MDR pathogens that no longer respond to conventional antibiotics, remains an attractive option.

==== Fecal microbiota transplants ====
Fecal microbiota transplants involve transferring the full intestinal microbiota from a healthy human donor (in the form of stool) to patients with &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection. Although this procedure has not been officially approved by the US FDA, its use is permitted under some conditions in patients with antibiotic-resistant &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection. Cure rates are around 90%, and work is underway to develop stool banks, standardized products, and methods of oral delivery. Fecal microbiota transplantation has also been used more recently for inflammatory bowel diseases.

==== Antisense RNA-based treatments ====

Antisense RNA-based treatment (also known as gene silencing therapy) involves (a) identifying bacterial genes that encode essential proteins (e.g. the &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; genes &quot;acpP&quot;, &quot;lpxC&quot;, and &quot;rpsJ&quot;), (b) synthesizing single-stranded RNA that is complementary to the mRNA encoding these essential proteins, and (c) delivering the single-stranded RNA to the infection site using cell-penetrating peptides or liposomes. The antisense RNA then hybridizes with the bacterial mRNA and blocks its translation into the essential protein. Antisense RNA-based treatment has been shown to be effective in &quot;in vivo&quot; models of &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; pneumonia.

In addition to silencing essential bacterial genes, antisense RNA can be used to silence bacterial genes responsible for antibiotic resistance. For example, antisense RNA has been developed that silences the &quot;S. aureus&quot; &quot;mecA&quot; gene (the gene that encodes modified penicillin-binding protein 2a and renders &quot;S. aureus&quot; strains methicillin-resistant). Antisense RNA targeting &quot;mecA&quot; mRNA has been shown to restore the susceptibility of methicillin-resistant staphylococci to oxacillin in both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; studies.

==== CRISPR-Cas9-based treatments ====
In the early 2000s, a system was discovered that enables bacteria to defend themselves against invading viruses. The system, known as CRISPR-Cas9, consists of (a) an enzyme that destroys DNA (the nuclease Cas9) and (b) the DNA sequences of previously encountered viral invaders (CRISPR). These viral DNA sequences enable the nuclease to target foreign (viral) rather than self (bacterial) DNA.

Although the function of CRISPR-Cas9 in nature is to protect bacteria, the DNA sequences in the CRISPR component of the system can be modified so that the Cas9 nuclease targets bacterial resistance genes or bacterial virulence genes instead of viral genes. The modified CRISPR-Cas9 system can then be administered to bacterial pathogens using plasmids or bacteriophages. This approach has successfully been used to silence antibiotic resistance and reduce the virulence of enterohemorrhagic &quot;E. coli&quot; in an &quot;in vivo&quot; model of infection.

=== Reducing the selection pressure for antibiotic resistance ===
In addition to developing new antibacterial treatments, it is important to reduce the selection pressure for the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), such as antibiotic resistance. Strategies to accomplish this include well-established infection control measures such as infrastructure improvement (e.g. less crowded housing), better sanitation (e.g. safe drinking water and food), better use of vaccines and vaccine development, other approaches such as antibiotic stewardship, and experimental approaches such as the use of prebiotics and probiotics to prevent infection. Antibiotic cycling, where antibiotics are alternated by clinicians to treat microbial diseases, is proposed, but recent studies revealed such strategies are ineffective against antibiotic resistance.

==== Vaccines ====

Vaccines are an essential part of the response to reduce AMR as they prevent infections, reduce the use and overuse of antimicrobials, and slow the emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens. Vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection, leading to the activation of macrophages, the production of antibodies, inflammation, and other classic immune reactions. Antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases.

<doc id="1806" wikidata="Q2685" url="?curid=1806" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">
<text>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger ( , ; born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian and American actor, businessman, former politician, and former professional bodybuilder, known for his roles in high-profile action films. He served as the 38th governor of California from 2003 to 2011.

Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at age 15 and won the Mr. Universe title aged 20, and subsequently the Mr. Olympia title seven times. He is tied with Phil Heath for the joint-second number of all-time Mr. Olympia wins, behind Ronnie Coleman and Lee Haney, who are joint-first with eight wins each. Nicknamed the &quot;Austrian Oak&quot; in his bodybuilding days, he is regarded as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time. He has written books and articles about bodybuilding, including the autobiographical &quot;Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder&quot; (1977) and &quot;The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding&quot; (1998). The Arnold Sports Festival, the second-most prestigious bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him. He appeared in the bodybuilding documentary &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; (1977), which set him on his way to a career in films.

After retiring from bodybuilding, Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough in the sword and sorcery epic &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982), a box-office success with a sequel in 1984. After playing the title character in the science fiction film &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), he starred in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991) and three other sequels. His other successful action films included &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1987), &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990), and &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), in addition to comedy films such as &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990) and &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; (1996). At the height of his career, Schwarzenegger was known for his rivalry with Sylvester Stallone. He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions.

As a registered member of the Republican Party, Schwarzenegger chaired the President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during most of the George H. W. Bush administration. In 2003, he was elected governor of California in a special recall election to replace Gray Davis, the governor at the time. He received 48.6 percent of the vote, 17 points ahead of the runner-up, Cruz Bustamante of the Democratic Party. He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis&#x27; term, and was reelected in the 2006 gubernatorial election with an increased vote share of 55.9 percent to serve a full term. In 2011 he reached his term limit as governor and returned to acting.

== Early life and education ==

Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Thal on July 30, 1947, the second son of Gustav Schwarzenegger and his wife Aurelia (née Jadrny; 1922–1998). Gustav was the local chief of police, and after the Anschluss in 1938 joined the Nazi Party and in 1939 the Sturmabteilung (SA). In World War II, Gustav served as a military policeman in the invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union, including the siege of Leningrad, rising to the title of &quot;Hauptfeldwebel&quot;. He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad, and was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. According to Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum, Gustav Schwarzenegger served &quot;in theaters of the war where atrocities were committed. But there is no way to know from the documents whether he played a role.&quot; Gustav&#x27;s background received wide press attention during the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election in which Schwarzenegger was elected.

Gustav married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: &quot;Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.&quot; He grew up in a Catholic family. Gustav preferred his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold. His favoritism was &quot;strong and blatant&quot;, which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child. Schwarzenegger says that his earliest childhood memory is of climbing into his parents&#x27; bed during a bad thunder-and-lightning storm and cuddling between his mother and father. He has said, however, that his father had &quot;no patience for listening or understanding your problems&quot;. He had a good relationship with his mother, with whom he kept in touch until her death.

In an interview with &quot;Fortune&quot; in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what &quot;would now be called child abuse&quot; at the hands of his father: &quot;My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I&#x27;ve seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn&#x27;t want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, &#x27;You can&#x27;t do this,&#x27; I said, &#x27;This is not going to be for much longer because I&#x27;m going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.

At school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average but stood out for his &quot;cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant&quot; character. He struggled with reading and was later diagnosed as being dyslexic. Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator. His father Gustav was an athlete, and wished for his sons to become champions in Bavarian curling. Influenced by his father, Schwarzenegger played several sports as a boy.

Schwarzenegger began weight training in 1960 when his football coach took his team to a local gym. At age 14, he chose bodybuilding over football as a career. He later said, &quot;I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I&#x27;d been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.&quot; However, his official website biography claims that &quot;at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.&quot; During a speech in 2001, he said, &quot;My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.&quot;
Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see films with bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves and Johnny Weissmuller. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: &quot;As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didn&#x27;t always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I&#x27;ve ever been fortunate enough to achieve.&quot; In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends to train even when it was closed. &quot;It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn&#x27;t look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn&#x27;t do it.&quot; When asked about his first cinema experience as a boy, he replied: &quot;I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie.&quot; In Graz, he was mentored by Alfred Gerstl, who had Jewish ancestry and later became president of the Federal Council, and befriended his son Karl.

Schwarzenegger&#x27;s brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971. He was driving drunk and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named Patrick. Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick&#x27;s education and helped him to move to the U.S. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s father, Gustav, died of a stroke on December 13, 1972. In &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;, Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father&#x27;s funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film&#x27;s producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger&#x27;s image colder to create controversy for the film. However, Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father&#x27;s death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother. Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father&#x27;s funeral.

Schwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males. During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest. He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: &quot;Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn&#x27;t carefully think through the consequences.&quot; He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel, where he placed second. He was voted &quot;best-built man of Europe&quot;, which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. &quot;The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America—the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.&quot; Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London. He placed second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner Chester Yorton.

Charles &quot;Wag&quot; Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton&#x27;s leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving his. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary English. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: &quot;Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you&#x27;re the age I was then, you&#x27;re always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn&#x27;t really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.&quot;

Also in 1966, at Bennett&#x27;s home, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at age 20. He would go on to win the title another three times. He then returned to Munich, where he attended business school and worked at Rolf Putziger&#x27;s gym, where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968 before returning to London in 1968 to win his next Mr. Universe title. He frequently told Roger C. Field, his English coach and friend in Munich at the time, &quot;I&#x27;m going to become the greatest actor!&quot;

Schwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the US since age ten, and saw bodybuilding as his avenue of opportunity, realized his dream by moving to the US in October 1968 at age 21, speaking little English. There he trained at Gold&#x27;s Gym in Venice, Los Angeles, California, under Joe Weider&#x27;s supervision. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s weight training partners was Ric Drasin, a professional wrestler who designed the original Gold&#x27;s Gym logo in 1973. Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler Superstar Billy Graham. In 1970, at age 23, Schwarzenegger captured his first Mr. Olympia title in New York, and would go on to win the title seven times.

The immigration law firm Siskind &amp; Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an illegal immigrant at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his visa. &quot;LA Weekly&quot; said in 2002 that Schwarzenegger was &quot;the most famous US immigrant&quot;, who &quot;overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s&quot;.

In 1977, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s autobiography and weight-training guide, &quot;Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder,&quot; was a huge success. In 1977, he posed for the gay magazine &quot;After Dark&quot;. After taking an assortment of courses at Santa Monica College in California (including English classes), as well as further upper division classes at the University of California, Los Angeles as part of UCLA&#x27;s extension program, he accumulated enough credits to be &quot;within striking distance&quot; of graduation. In 1979, he enrolled in the University of Wisconsin–Superior as a distance education student, completing most of his coursework by correspondence and flying out to Superior to meet professors and take final exams. In May 1980, he formally graduated and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration and marketing. He received his United States citizenship in 1983. He received an honorary degree from Stockton University in 2023.

== Bodybuilding career ==
Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.

For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines &quot;Muscle &amp; Fitness&quot; and &quot;Flex&quot;. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor&#x27;s various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor&#x27;s office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California. Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005. American Media Inc., which owns &quot;Muscle &amp; Fitness&quot; and &quot;Flex&quot;, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.

One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965. He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19. He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4 – NABBA [England], 1 – IFBB [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.

Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.

=== Powerlifting/weightlifting ===
During Schwarzenegger&#x27;s early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting contests. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s first professional competition was in 1963 and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.

In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.

=== Mr. Olympia ===

Schwarzenegger&#x27;s goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia. His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.

He continued his winning streak in the 1971–1974 competitions. He also toured different countries selling vitamins, as in Helsinki, Finland in 1972, when he lived at the YMCA Hotel Hospiz (nowadays Hotel Arthur) on Vuorikatu and presented vitamin pills at the Stockmann shopping center. In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time, beating Franco Columbu. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.

Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete and film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;. Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; with Jeff Bridges. Although significantly taller and heavier, Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.

Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger was training for his role in &quot;Conan&quot;, and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide color commentary for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, &quot;Why not compete?&quot; Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition. This victory (subject of the documentary &quot;The Comeback&quot;) was highly controversial, though, as fellow competitors and many observers felt that his lack of muscle mass (especially in his thighs) and subpar conditioning should have precluded him from winning against a very competitive lineup that year. Mike Mentzer, in particular, felt cheated and withdrew from competitive bodybuilding after that contest.

=== Steroid use ===
Schwarzenegger has acknowledged using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal, writing in 1977 that &quot;steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up.&quot; He has called the drugs &quot;tissue building&quot;.

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and later heart problems. Since the doctor never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court. In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with &quot;Globe&quot;, a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder&#x27;s future health.

== Acting career ==
=== 1970–1981: Early roles ===
Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the title role in &quot;Hercules in New York&quot; (1970). Credited under the stage name &quot;Arnold Strong&quot;, his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a mob hitman in &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; (1976), for which he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: &quot;It was very difficult for me in the beginning – I was told by agents and casting people that my body was &#x27;too weird&#x27;, that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.&quot;

Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; (1977), elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography. In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the ABC sitcom &quot;The San Pedro Beach Bums&quot; and the ABC police procedural &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, but did not win the role because of his height. Later, Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner&#x27;s alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy &quot;The Villain&quot;. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress Jayne Mansfield as Mansfield&#x27;s husband, Mickey Hargitay.

=== 1982–2003: Breakthrough and established action star ===

Schwarzenegger&#x27;s breakthrough film was the sword and sorcery epic &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; in 1982, which was a box-office hit. This was followed by a sequel, &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;, in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor. In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video &quot;Carnival in Rio&quot;. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character in James Cameron&#x27;s science fiction action film &quot;The Terminator&quot;. It has been called his acting career&#x27;s signature role. Following this, Schwarzenegger made another sword and sorcery film, &quot;Red Sonja&quot;, in 1985. During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars. During the Schwarzenegger-Stallone rivalry they attacked each other in the press, and tried to surpass the other with more on-screen killings and larger weapons. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), &quot;Raw Deal&quot; (1986), &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1987), &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), and &quot;Red Heat&quot; (1988).
&quot;Twins&quot; (1988), a comedy with Danny DeVito, also proved successful. &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10 million (equivalent to $ million today) and 15% of the film&#x27;s gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot;. &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman, who directed him in &quot;Twins&quot;. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;The Switch&quot;, and then with the 1992 telemovie &quot;Christmas in Connecticut&quot;. He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger&#x27;s commercial peak was his return as the title character in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), which was the highest-grossing film of the year. Film critic Roger Ebert commented that &quot;Schwarzenegger&#x27;s genius as a movie star is to find roles that build on, rather than undermine, his physical and vocal characteristics.&quot; In 1993, the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the &quot;International Star of the Decade&quot;. His next film project, the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, was released opposite &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.

That same year, the comedy &quot;Junior&quot; was released, the last of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the action thriller &quot;Eraser&quot; (1996), the Christmas comedy &quot;Jingle All The Way&quot; (1996), and the comic book-based &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), in which he played the supervillain Mr. Freeze. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller &quot;End of Days&quot; (1999), later followed by the action films &quot;The 6th Day&quot; (2000) and &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, which went on to earn over $150 million domestically (equivalent to $ million today).

In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a &quot;Terminator&quot; statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the Special Olympics.

=== 2004–2010: Retirement ===
His film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in &quot;The Rundown&quot; and the 2004 remake of &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film &quot;The Kid &amp; I&quot;. He voiced Baron von Steuben in the &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Kids&quot; episode &quot;Valley Forge&quot;. He had been rumored to be appearing in &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; as the original T-800; he denied his involvement, but he ultimately did appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first &quot;Terminator&quot; film. Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s &quot;The Expendables&quot; (2010), where he made a cameo appearance.

=== 2011–present: Return to acting ===
In January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama &quot;With Wings as Eagles&quot;, written by Randall Wallace, based on a true story.

On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the Arnold Classic, Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to &quot;The Terminator&quot; and remakes of &quot;Predator&quot; and &quot;The Running Man&quot;, and that he was &quot;packaging&quot; a comic book character. The character was later revealed to be the Governator, star of the comic book and animated series of the same name. Schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with Stan Lee, who would have produced the series. Schwarzenegger would have voiced the Governator.

On May 20, 2011, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s entertainment counsel announced that all film projects currently in development were being halted: &quot;Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines.&quot; On July 11, 2011, it was announced that Schwarzenegger was considering a comeback film, despite legal problems related to his divorce. He starred in &quot;The Expendables 2&quot; (2012) as Trench Mauser, and starred in &quot;The Last Stand&quot; (2013), his first leading role in 10 years, and &quot;Escape Plan&quot; (2013), his first co-starring role alongside Sylvester Stallone. He starred in &quot;Sabotage&quot;, released in March 2014, and returned as Trench Mauser in &quot;The Expendables 3&quot;, released in August 2014. He starred in the fifth Terminator film &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; in 2015. He then planned to reprise his role as Conan the Barbarian in &quot;The Legend of Conan&quot;, later renamed &quot;Conan the Conqueror&quot;. However, in April 2017, producer Chris Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, although there was a possibility of a TV show. The story of the film was supposed to be set 30 years after the first, with some inspiration from Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Unforgiven&quot;.

In September 2015, the media announced that Schwarzenegger was to replace Donald Trump as host of &quot;The New Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. This show, the 15th season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, aired during the 2016–2017 TV season. In the show, he used the phrases &quot;you&#x27;re terminated&quot; and &quot;get to the choppa&quot;, which are quotes from some of his famous roles (&quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot;, respectively), when firing the contestants. In March 2017, following repeated criticisms from Trump, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show. He also reacted to Trump&#x27;s remarks in January 2017 via Instagram: &quot;Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don&#x27;t we switch jobs? You take over TV because you&#x27;re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.&quot;

In August 2016, his filming of action-comedy &quot;Killing Gunther&quot; was temporarily interrupted by bank robbers near the filming location in Surrey, British Columbia. The film was released in September 2017. He was announced to star and produce in a film about the ruins of Sanxingdui called &quot;The Guest of Sanxingdui&quot; as an ambassador.

On February 6, 2018, Amazon Studios announced they were working with Schwarzenegger to develop a new series, &quot;Outrider,&quot; in which he will star and executive produce. The western-drama set in the Oklahoma Indian Territory in the late 19th century will follow a deputy (portrayed by Schwarzenegger) who is tasked with apprehending a legendary outlaw in the wilderness, but is forced to partner with a ruthless Federal Marshal to make sure justice is properly served. The series would have been Schwarzenegger&#x27;s first major scripted TV role but was never completed.

Schwarzenegger returned to the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise with &quot;&quot;, which was released on November 1, 2019. It was produced by the series&#x27; co-creator James Cameron, who directed him previously in the first two films in the series and in &quot;True Lies&quot;. It was shot in Almería, Hungary and the US.

== Political career ==
=== Early politics ===
Schwarzenegger has been a registered Republican for many years. When he was an actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a left-wing and Democratic-leaning community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained that he was a Republican because he believed the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.


In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in &quot;Stop the Madness&quot;, an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the 1988 presidential election, accompanying then–Vice President George H. W. Bush at a campaign rally.

Schwarzenegger famously introduced the first episode of the 1990 Milton Friedman hosted PBS series &quot;Free to Choose&quot; stating:

 Schwarzenegger goes on to tell of how he and his then wife Maria Shriver were in Palm Springs preparing to play a game of mixed doubles when Milton Friedman&#x27;s famous show came on the television. Schwarzenegger recalls that while watching Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Free to Choose&quot;, Schwarzenegger, &quot;...recognized Friedman from the study of my own degree in economics, but I didn&#x27;t know I was watching Free to Choose... it knocked me out. Dr. Friedman expressed, validated and explained everything I ever thought or experienced or observed about the way the economy works, and I guess I was really ready to hear it.&quot; Numerous critics state that Schwarzenegger strayed from much of Friedman&#x27;s economic ways of thinking in later years, especially upon being elected Governor of California from 2003 through 2011.

Schwarzenegger&#x27;s first political appointment was as chairman of the President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993. He was nominated by the then-President Bush, who dubbed him &quot;Conan the Republican&quot;. He later served as chairman for the California Governor&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson.

Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television and radio public service announcements to donate blood.

In an interview with &quot;Talk&quot; magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, &quot;I think about it many times. The possibility is there because I feel it inside.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California. Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, &quot;I&#x27;m in show business – I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?&quot;

=== Governor of California ===

Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the &quot;Governator&quot; (referring to &quot;The Terminator&quot; movies, see above) and &quot;The Running Man&quot; (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election &quot;Total Recall&quot; (another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.
On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor Gray Davis being removed from office with 55.4% of the &quot;Yes&quot; vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3 million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862.

Schwarzenegger is a moderate Republican. He says he is fiscally conservative and socially liberal. On the issue of abortion, he describes himself as pro-choice, but supports parental notification for minors and a ban on partial-birth abortion. He has supported gay rights, such as domestic partnerships, and he performed a same-sex marriage as governor. However, Schwarzenegger vetoed bills that would have legalized same-sex marriage in California in 2005 and 2007. He additionally vetoed two bills that would have implemented a single-payer health care system in California in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

Schwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up political gridlock. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch &quot;Hans and Franz&quot; from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians &quot;girlie men&quot;.

Schwarzenegger&#x27;s early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver&#x27;s licenses from being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He later commented that &quot;no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you&quot;. The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions&#x27; use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in &quot;Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000&quot;.
Schwarzenegger, against the advice of fellow Republican strategists, appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. He gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat Phil Angelides, the California State Treasurer, in the 2006 elections, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over 1 million votes. Around this time, many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast, in which Schwarzenegger said, in part &quot;How wrong I was when I said everyone has an equal opportunity to make it in America ... the state of California does not provide [equal] education for all of our children&quot;, San Francisco mayor and future governor of California Gavin Newsom said: &quot;He&#x27;s becoming a Democrat ... He&#x27;s running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left.&quot;

Some speculated that Schwarzenegger might run for the United States Senate in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. Such rumors turned out to be false.
Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as the means to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, &quot;I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential – I was always fascinated by people in control of other people.&quot; Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, &quot;I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes.&quot; Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.

Schwarzenegger cannot run for U.S. president as he is not a natural-born citizen of the United States. Schwarzenegger is a dual Austrian and United States citizen. He has held Austrian citizenship since birth and U.S. citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European, he was able to win the 2007 European Voice campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU.
Because of his personal wealth from his acting career, Schwarzenegger did not accept his governor&#x27;s salary of $175,000 per year.

Schwarzenegger&#x27;s endorsement in the Republican primaries of the 2008 presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, &quot;It&#x27;s Rudy&#x27;s fault!&quot; (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger&#x27;s endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain&#x27;s campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.

In its April 2010 report, Progressive ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Schwarzenegger one of 11 &quot;worst governors&quot; in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger&#x27;s term as governor.

Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law, in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, Schwarzenegger launched an intense campaign against Proposition 66. He stated that &quot;it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists&quot;.

Although he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings (as high as 65% in May 2004), he left office with a near-record low 23%, only one percent higher than that of Gray Davis, his predecessor, when he was recalled in October 2003.

==== Death of Luis Santos ====

In May 2010, Esteban Núñez pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the death of Luis Santos. Núñez is the son of Fabian Núñez, then California Assembly Speaker of the House and a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Schwarzenegger.

As a personal favor to &quot;a friend&quot;, just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger commuted Núñez&#x27;s sentence by more than half, to seven years. He believed that Núñez&#x27;s sentence was &quot;excessive&quot; in comparison with the same prison term imposed on Ryan Jett, the man who fatally stabbed Santos. Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos&#x27; family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter.

The Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated Marsy&#x27;s Law. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, &quot;Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion... This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state.&quot; However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor. Subsequently, as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill that allows offenders&#x27; victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days before any commutations. Núñez was released from prison after serving less than six years.

=== Allegations of sexual misconduct ===

During his initial campaign for governor in 2003, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger. Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; recounting decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct from six individual women. Schwarzenegger responded to the allegations in 2004 admitting that he has &quot;behaved badly sometimes&quot; and apologized, but also stated that &quot;a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true&quot;. One of the women who came forward was British television personality Anna Richardson, who settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger; his top aide, Sean Walsh; and his publicist, Sheryl Main. A joint statement read: &quot;The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled.&quot; In 2023, Schwarzenegger revisited the issue while promoting his new three-part biographical documentary on Netflix called &quot;Arnold&quot;. Schwarzenegger stated that he was &quot;totally wrong&quot;.

=== Marijuana use ===
During this time a 1977 interview in adult magazine &quot;Oui&quot; gained attention, in which Schwarzenegger discussed using substances such as marijuana. Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in 1975 in the documentary film &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; (1977). In an interview with &quot;GQ&quot; magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, &quot;[Marijuana] is not a drug. It&#x27;s a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me.&quot; His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.

=== Citizenship ===

Schwarzenegger became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 17, 1983. Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship, as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship.

In 2005, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party, unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger&#x27;s Austrian citizenship under Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: &quot;A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.&quot;. Pilz felt that Schwarzenegger&#x27;s decision not to intervene in the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams had done so. The death penalty in Austria had been abolished in 1968.

=== Environmental record ===
On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, creating the nation&#x27;s first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state&#x27;s greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California&#x27;s emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast&#x27;s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the number of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009. In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.

In respect for his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 SAE World Congress in Detroit on April 20, 2009.

In 2011, Schwarzenegger founded the R20 Regions of Climate Action to develop a sustainable, low-carbon economy. In 2017, he joined French President Emmanuel Macron in calling for the adoption of a Global Pact for the Environment.
In 2017, Schwarzenegger launched the Austrian World Summit, an international climate conference that is held annually in Vienna, Austria. The Austrian World Summit is organized by the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative and aims is to bring together representatives from politics, civil society and business to create a broad alliance for climate protection and to identify concrete solutions to the climate crisis.

=== Electoral history ===




=== Presidential ambitions ===
Presidential aspirations by the Austrian-born Schwarzenegger would be blocked by a constitutional hurdle; Article II, Section I, Clause V, prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. The Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment in 2003 was widely accredited as the &quot;Amend for Arnold&quot; bill, which would have added an amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing his run. In 2004, the &quot;Amend for Arnold&quot; campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.

In June 2007, Schwarzenegger was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine with Michael Bloomberg, and subsequently, the two joked about a presidential ticket together.

== Business career ==
Schwarzenegger has also enjoyed a highly successful business career. Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a &quot;prolific goal setter&quot; and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car – and succeed in doing so. As a result of his early business and investment success, Schwarzenegger became a millionaire by the age of 25, well before making a name for himself in Hollywood. His path to financial independence came as a result of his success as a proactive businessman and investor involved with a series of lucrative business ventures and real estate investments.

===Early ventures===
In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair&#x27;s marketing savvy and an increased demand following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. When signs of profitability emerged as business began to pick up, Schwarzenegger and Columbu rolled over the profits from their bricklaying venture to go on and start their own mail-order business that sold bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.

=== Investments ===
Schwarzenegger transferred profits from the mail-order business and his bodybuilding-competition winnings by rolling the proceeds into his first real estate investment: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. Schwarzenegger made millions of dollars by investing in a variety of real estate holding companies both within the United States and around the world. Schwarzenegger and fellow Hollywood veteran actor and industry adversary Sylvester Stallone brought their long-storied industry rivalry to an end by both investing in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe) along with Bruce Willis and Demi Moore. However, Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the chain in early 2000. Schwarzenegger remarked that the restaurant did not achieve the success that he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on &quot;new US global business ventures&quot; and his then-burgeoning acting career.

Schwarzenegger also made a private commercial real estate investment in the Easton Town Center, a shopping mall based in Columbus, Ohio. He has talked about some of the mentors who have helped him over the years in business: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from Milton Friedman to Donald Trump... and now, Les Wexner and Warren Buffett. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!&quot; He has significant equity ownership in Dimensional Fund Advisors, an Austin-based investment firm. Schwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnold&#x27;s Sports Festival, a sports and fitness festival which he started in 1989 and is held annually in Columbus, Ohio. It is a festival that hosts thousands of international health and fitness professionals which has also expanded into a three-day expo. He also owns a film production company called Oak Productions, Inc. and Fitness Publications, a joint book publishing venture partnered with Simon &amp; Schuster.

In 2018, Schwarzenegger partnered with basketball player LeBron James to establish Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps. The pair sold Ladder to Openfit for an undisclosed amount in 2020 after reporting more than $4 million in sales for that year.

=== Restaurant ===
In 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in Santa Monica called Schatzi On Main. &quot;Schatzi&quot; literally means &quot;little treasure&quot;, and colloquially &quot;honey&quot; or &quot;darling&quot; in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant.

=== Wealth ===
In 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Schwarzenegger was a billionaire.

In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38 million on a private Gulfstream jet.

Regarding his private fortune, Schwarzenegger once quipped: &quot;Money doesn&#x27;t make you happy. I now have $50 million, but I was just as happy when I had $48 million.&quot;

In 2003, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s net worth was conservatively estimated at $100 million to $200 million.

After separating from his wife, Maria Shriver, in 2011, it was estimated that his net worth had been approximately $400 million, and even as high as $800 million, based on tax returns he filed in 2006.

=== Commercial advertisements ===
Schwarzenegger has also appeared in a series of commercials for the Machine Zone game &quot;Mobile Strike&quot; as a military commander and spokesman.

== Personal life ==

=== Early relationships ===
In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher with whom he lived until 1974. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica, California, for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had &quot;little understanding of polite society&quot; and she found him a turn-off, she says, &quot;He&#x27;s as much a self-made man as it&#x27;s possible to be—he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I&#x27;ll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.&quot; Schwarzenegger said of Baker in his 1977 memoir, &quot;Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.&quot; Baker has described Schwarzenegger as a &quot;joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic&quot; but claims that towards the end of the relationship he became &quot;insufferable—classically conceited—the world revolved around him&quot;. Baker published her memoir in 2006, &quot;Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak&quot;. Although Baker painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover at times, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.

Schwarzenegger met his next lover, Beverly Hills hairdresser&#x27;s assistant Sue Moray, on Venice Beach in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: &quot;We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.&quot;

Schwarzenegger met television journalist Maria Shriver, niece of President John F. Kennedy, at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978 when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.

=== Marriage and family ===

On April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married Shriver in Hyannis, Massachusetts. They have four children: Katherine (* 1989), Christina (* 1991), Patrick (* 1993) and Christopher (* 1997). All of their children were born in Los Angeles. The family lived in an home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, with vacation homes in Sun Valley, Idaho, and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. They attended St. Monica&#x27;s Catholic Church.

==== Divorce ====
On May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger ended their relationship after 25 years of marriage with Shriver moving out of their Brentwood mansion.

Pursuant to the divorce judgment, Schwarzenegger kept the Brentwood home, while Shriver purchased a new home nearby so that the children could travel between their parents&#x27; homes. They shared custody of the two youngest children. Schwarzenegger came under fire after the initial petition did not include spousal support and a reimbursement of attorney&#x27;s fees. However, he claims this was not intentional and that he signed the initial documents without having properly read them. He filed amended divorce papers remedying this. Schwarzenegger and Shriver finalized their divorce in 2021, ten years after separating.

In June 2022, a jury ruled that Maria Shriver was entitled to half of her ex-husband&#x27;s post-divorce savings that he earned from 1986 to 2011, including a pension.

On May 16, 2011, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son, Joseph, more than 14 years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia &quot;Patty&quot; Baena. &quot;After leaving the governor&#x27;s office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,&quot; Schwarzenegger said to the &quot;Times&quot;. In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after she had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child. 
Baena is of Guatemalan origin. She was employed by the family for 20 years and retired in January 2011. The pregnant Baena was working in the home while Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple&#x27;s four children. Baena&#x27;s son with Schwarzenegger was born five days after Shriver gave birth. Schwarzenegger said that it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy &quot;started looking like [him] ... that [he] put things together&quot;. Schwarzenegger has taken financial responsibility for the child &quot;from the start and continued to provide support&quot;. KNX 1070 radio reported that, in 2010, he bought a new four-bedroom house with a pool for Baena and their son in Bakersfield, California. Baena separated from her husband, Rogelio, a few months after Joseph&#x27;s birth. She filed for divorce in 2008. Rogelio said that the child&#x27;s birth certificate was falsified and that he planned to sue Schwarzenegger for engaging in conspiracy to falsify a public document, a serious crime in California.

When asked in January 2014, &quot;Of all the things you are famous for ... which are you least proud of?&quot; Schwarzenegger replied, &quot;I&#x27;m least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up.&quot;

=== Accidents, injuries, and other health problems ===

==== Health problems ====
Schwarzenegger was born with a bicuspid aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets, where a normal aortic valve has three. He opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made from his own pulmonary valve, which itself was replaced with a cadaveric pulmonic valve, in a Ross procedure; medical experts predicted he would require pulmonic heart valve replacement surgery within the next two to eight years because his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.

On March 29, 2018, Schwarzenegger underwent emergency open-heart surgery for replacement of his replacement pulmonic valve. He said about his recovery: &quot;I underwent open-heart surgery this spring, I had to use a walker. I had to do breathing exercises five times a day to retrain my lungs. I was frustrated and angry, and in my worst moments, I couldn&#x27;t see the way back to my old self.&quot;

In 2020, 23 years after his first surgery, Schwarzenegger underwent a surgery for a new aortic valve.

==== Accidents and injuries ====
On December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.

Schwarzenegger saved a drowning man in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.

On January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle in Los Angeles with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, Schwarzenegger sustained an injury to his lip requiring 15 stitches. &quot;No citations were issued,&quot; said Officer Jason Lee, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.

Schwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right femur while skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho, with his family on December 23, 2006. On December 26, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from St. Johns Hospital and Health Center on December 30, 2006.

Schwarzenegger&#x27;s private jet made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by his press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.

On May 18, 2019, while on a visit to South Africa, Schwarzenegger was attacked and dropkicked from behind by an unknown malefactor while giving autographs to his fans at one of the local schools. Despite the surprise and unprovoked nature of the attack, he reportedly suffered no injuries and continued to interact with fans. The attacker was apprehended and Schwarzenegger declined to press charges against him.

Schwarzenegger was involved in a multi-vehicle collision on the afternoon of Friday, January 21, 2022. Schwarzenegger was driving a black GMC Yukon SUV near the intersections of Sunset Boulevard and Allenford Avenue in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, when his vehicle collided with a red Toyota Prius. The driver of the Prius was transported to the hospital for injuries sustained to her head. Schwarzenegger was uninjured.

=== Height ===
Schwarzenegger&#x27;s official height of has been brought into question by several articles. During his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, it was claimed that he measured . However, in 1988, both the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter. Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s height was once again questioned in an article by the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, &quot;settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is&quot; by using a tailor&#x27;s tape measure on the Governor. Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words &quot;Need a lift?&quot; on the Wesson&#x27;s chair before a negotiating session in his office. Democrat Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger was and that he wore risers in his boots. In 1999, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine stated his height was .

=== Autobiography ===
Schwarzenegger&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Total Recall&quot;, was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called &quot;The Secret&quot; to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California. Schwarzenegger released a second book in 2023 titled &quot;Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life&quot;, which features life advice and again touches on his life experiences.

=== Vehicles ===
Growing up during Allied-occupied Austria, Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child. As a result, he paid $20,000 to bring his Austrian Army M47 Patton tank (331) to the United States, which he previously operated during his mandatory service in 1965. However, he later obtained his vehicle in 1991/2, during his tenure as the Chairmen of the President&#x27;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and now uses it to support his charity. His first car ever was an Opel Kadett in 1969 after serving in the Austrian army, then he rode a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy in 1991.

Moreover, he came to develop an interest in large vehicles and became the first civilian in the U.S. to purchase a Humvee. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee&#x27;s manufacturer, AM General, to produce a street-legal, civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two Hummer H1s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for hydrogen, one for vegetable oil, and one for biodiesel. Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse. He was spotted and filmed in 2015 in his car, painted silver with bright aluminium forged wheels. His Bugatti has its interior adorned in dark brown leather. In 2017, Schwarzenegger acquired a Mercedes G-Class modified for all-electric drive.

The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large—each weighs and is wide—that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign, he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a United States Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost. California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.

== Public image and legacy ==

Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the &quot;Austrian Oak&quot; in his bodybuilding days, &quot;Arnie&quot; or &quot;Schwarzy&quot; during his acting career, and &quot;the Governator&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;Governor&quot; and &quot;Terminator&quot;) during his political career. He married Maria Shriver, a niece of the former U.S. president John F. Kennedy, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997; their divorce was finalized in 2021.

Schwarzenegger has been involved with the Special Olympics for many years after they were founded in 1968 by his later mother-in-law Eunice Kennedy Shriver. In 2007, Schwarzenegger was the official spokesperson for the Special Olympics held in Shanghai, China. Schwarzenegger believes that quality school opportunities should be made available to children who might not normally be able to access them. In 1995, he founded the Inner City Games Foundation (ICG) which provides cultural, educational and community enrichment programming to youth. ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide. He has also been involved with After-School All-Stars and founded the Los Angeles branch in 2002. ASAS is an after school program provider, educating youth about health, fitness and nutrition.

On February 12, 2010, Schwarzenegger took part in the Vancouver Olympic Torch relay. He handed off the flame to the next runner, Sebastian Coe.

Schwarzenegger had a collection of Marxist busts, which he requested from Russian friends during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as they were being destroyed. In 2011, he revealed that his wife had requested their removal, but he kept the one of Vladimir Lenin present, since &quot;he was the first&quot;. In 2015, he said he kept the Lenin bust to &quot;show losers&quot;.

Schwarzenegger is a supporter of Israel, and has participated in a Los Angeles pro-Israel rally among other similar events. In 2004, Schwarzenegger visited Israel to break ground on Simon Wiesenthal Center&#x27;s Museum of Tolerance Jerusalem, and to lay a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial, he also met with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Moshe Katsav. In 2011, at the Independence Day celebration hosted by the Israeli Consulate General in Los Angeles, Schwarzenegger said: &quot;I love Israel. When I became governor, Israel was the first country that I visited. When I had the chance to sign a bill calling on California pension funds to divest their money from companies that do business with Iran, I immediately signed that bill&quot;, then he added, &quot;I knew that we could not send money to these crazy dictators who hate us and threaten Israel any time they have a bad day.&quot;
Schwarzenegger supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Schwarzenegger also expressed support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In 2014, Schwarzenegger released a video message in support of the Euromaidan protests against Ukraine&#x27;s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. In 2022, Schwarzenegger released another video message condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s Twitter account is one of the 22 accounts that the president of Russia&#x27;s Twitter account follows.

Schwarzenegger, who played football as a boy, grew up watching Bayern Munich and Sturm Graz. He also expressed his admiration of Jürgen Klopp&#x27;s Liverpool in October 2019.

Schwarzenegger inspired many actors to become action heroes, including Dwayne Johnson, Matt McColm, Christian Boeving, Vidyut Jamwal, and Daniel Greene. Boeving&#x27;s character in the 2003 action film &quot;When Eagles Strike&quot; was based on Schwarzenegger&#x27;s image from the late 1980s: mostly on Major &quot;Dutch&quot; Schaefer from &quot;Predator&quot; (1987) and Colonel John Matrix from &quot;Commando&quot; (1985).

=== Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy ===
In 2012, Schwarzenegger helped to found the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which is a part of the USC Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California. The institute&#x27;s mission is to &quot;[advance] post-partisanship, where leaders put people over political parties and work together to find the best ideas and solutions to benefit the people they serve&quot; and to &quot;seek to influence public policy and public debate in finding solutions to the serious challenges we face&quot;. Schwarzenegger serves as chairman of the institute.

=== Statue of Arnold Schwarzenegger ===

An , bronze sculpture of Schwarzenegger performing his signature &#x27;twisted double biceps pose&#x27; designed by sculptor Ralph Crawford is located outside the Greater Columbus Convention Center Columbus, Ohio, which is the venue of the annual Arnold Sports Festival.

=== 2016 presidential election ===
For the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Schwarzenegger endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich. However, he announced in October that he would not vote for the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in that year&#x27;s United States presidential election, with this being the first time he did not vote for the Republican candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.

=== Post-2016 activism===
In 2017, Schwarzenegger condemned white supremacists who were seen carrying Nazi and Confederate flags by calling their heroes &quot;losers&quot;.

Following the January 6 United States Capitol attack by supporters of President Donald Trump, Schwarzenegger posted a video address on social media in which he likened the insurrection to Nazi Germany&#x27;s Kristallnacht, which he described as &quot;a night of rampage against the Jews carried out [by] the Nazi equivalent of the Proud Boys.&quot; He spoke of his father&#x27;s alcoholism, domestic violence, and abuse, and how it was typical of other former Nazis and collaborators in the post-war era; and described Trump as &quot;a failed leader. He will go down in history as the worst president ever.&quot;

In late March 2021, Schwarzenegger was interviewed by &quot;Politico&quot; about the upcoming recall election in California in which he said that &quot;it&#x27;s pretty much the same atmosphere today as it was then,&quot; and when he was asked about Newsom&#x27;s claim of this being a &quot;Republican recall&quot; he responded that &quot;this recall effort is sparked by ordinary folks,&quot; and that this was not a power grab by Republicans.

Schwarzenegger has spoken out about COVID-19, urging Americans to wear masks and practice social distancing. In August 2021, he said: &quot;There is a virus here. It kills people and the only way we prevent it is: get vaccinated, wear masks, do social distancing, washing your hands all the time, and not just to think about, &#x27;Well my freedom is being kind of disturbed here.&#x27; No, screw your freedom.&quot;

On January 17, 2024, Schwarzenegger was detained by German authorities after failing to claim an item to customs agents after landing in Munich. A spokesperson for the customs agency said that Schwarzenegger would face criminal tax proceedings because he failed to declare an item that originated in a country that is not a part of the European Union. The item in question was a watch manufactured by Audemars Piguet, a Swiss company. A spokesperson for Schwarzenegger said that he was never asked to fill out a declaration form and he was compliant with officials upon his detainment. Schwarzenegger was held for three hours and was released after pre-paying potential taxes. The watch was subsequently auctioned off at a dinner in Kitzbühel to raise funds for the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative the next day, fetching €270,000.

On October 30, 2024, Schwarzenegger endorsed Kamala Harris for president.

===Diet, health, and climate change===

At a 2015 security conference, Schwarzenegger called climate change the issue of our time, and urged politicians to stop treating it as a political issue. Next, in 2016, he collaborated on a campaign by WildAid, starring in the PSA, &quot;Less Meat, Less Heat,&quot; that encourages people to eat less meat as a means of combating climate change.

In 2018, he appeared in, and served as an executive producer (alongside James Cameron et al.) for, the documentary &quot;The Game Changers&quot;. This film explores the rise of plant-based diets in professional sports.

In February 2022, he said that he has &quot;been about 80% plant-based for the past five years of my life&quot;. He also says that while he occasionally still consumes smaller amounts of animal products, following a mostly plant-based diet is better for his &quot;overall-health,&quot; and that James Cameron helped him to understand that it is better for the environment.

<doc id="1810" wikidata="Q216551" url="?curid=1810" title="Actium">
<text>Actium or Aktion () was a town on a promontory in ancient Acarnania at the entrance of the Ambraciot Gulf, off which Octavian gained his celebrated victory, the Battle of Actium, over Antony and Cleopatra, on September 2, 31 BCE.

==History==

Actium belonged originally to the Corinthian colonists of Anactorium, who probably founded the sanctuary of Apollo Actius. This temple was of great antiquity. In the 3rd century BCE it fell to the Acarnanians, who subsequently held their religious summits there.

There was also an ancient festival named Actia, celebrated here in honour of the god. Augustus after his victory enlarged the temple, and revived the ancient festival, which was henceforth celebrated once in five years (πενταετηρίς, ludi quinquennales), with musical and gymnastic contests, and horse races.

We learn from a Greek inscription found on the site of Actium, and which is probably prior to the time of Augustus, that the chief priest of the temple was called Ἱεραπόλος, and that his name was employed in official documents, like that of the first Archon at Athens, to mark the date. Strabo says that the temple was situated on an eminence, and that below was a plain with a grove of trees, and a dock-yard; and in another passage he describes the harbour as situated outside of the gulf.

On the opposite coast of Epirus, Augustus founded the city of Nicopolis in honour of his victory. After the foundation of Nicopolis, a few buildings sprang up around the temple, and it served as a kind of suburb to Nicopolis.

==Archaeology==
On October 8, 1980, the Greek Ministry of Transport and Communications reported that shipwrecks from the Battle of Actium had been located at Actium near the entrance to the Ambracan Gulf.

In Summer 2009, archaeologists discovered the ruins of the Temple of Apollo and found two statue heads, one of Apollo, one of Artemis (Diana).

<doc id="1812" wikidata="Q481800" url="?curid=1812" title="Amway">
<text>Amway Corp. (short for &quot;American Way&quot;) is an American multi-level marketing (MLM) company that sells health, beauty, and home care products. The company was founded in 1959 by Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos and is based in Ada, Michigan. Amway and its sister companies under Alticor reported sales of $8.9 billion in 2019. It is the largest multi-level marketing company in the world by revenue. It conducts business through a number of affiliated companies in more than a hundred countries and territories.

Amway has been investigated in various countries and by institutions such as the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for alleged pyramid scheme practices. The company has paid tens of millions of dollars to settle these suits. In 1983, Amway admitted to defrauding the Canadian government of customs duties and taxes by falsely undervaluing goods it imported into the country over a period of 15 years; it had to pay a fine. Between 2007 and 2008, Amway was found guilty of illegal business practices in India, a ruling upheld by the Supreme Court of India and followed in 2021 by India&#x27;s Enforcement Directorate attaching company and bank assets, and labeling Amway&#x27;s business model a &quot;pyramid fraud&quot; and its product offerings a &quot;masquerade&quot;.

==History==

===Founding===

Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos had been friends since school days and business partners in various endeavors, including a hamburger stand, an air charter service, and a sailing business. In 1949, they were introduced to the Nutrilite Products Corporation by Van Andel&#x27;s second cousin Neil Maaskant. DeVos and Van Andel signed up to become distributors for Nutrilite food supplements in August. They sold their first box the next day for $19.50, but lost interest for the next two weeks. They traveled to Chicago to attend a Nutrilite seminar soon afterward, at the urging of Maaskant, who had become their sponsor. They watched promotional filmstrips and listened to talks by company representatives and successful distributors, then they decided to pursue the Nutrilite business. They sold their second box of supplements on their return trip to Michigan, and rapidly proceeded to develop the business further.

Earlier in 1949, DeVos and Van Andel had formed the Ja-Ri Corporation (abbreviated from their respective first names) to import wooden goods from South American countries. After the Chicago seminar, they turned Ja-Ri into a Nutrilite distributorship instead. In addition to profits on each product sold, Nutrilite offered commissions on sales made by new distributors introduced to the company by existing distributors—a system known as multi-level marketing or network marketing. By 1958, DeVos and Van Andel had built an organization of more than 5,000 distributors. However, they and some of their top distributors formed the American Way Association, or Amway, in April 1959 in response to concerns about the stability of Nutrilite and in order to represent the distributors and look for additional products to market.

Their first product was called Frisk, an organic cleaner developed by a scientist in Ohio. DeVos and Van Andel bought the rights to manufacture and distribute Frisk, and later changed the name to LOC (Liquid Organic Cleaner). They subsequently formed the Amway Sales Corporation to procure and inventory products and to handle sales and marketing plans, and the Amway Services Corporation to handle insurance and other benefits for distributors. In 1960, they purchased a 50% share in Atco Manufacturing Company in Detroit, the original manufacturers of LOC, and changed its name to Amway Manufacturing Corporation. In 1964, the Amway Sales Corporation, Amway Services Corporation, and Amway Manufacturing Corporation merged to form the Amway Corporation.

Amway bought a controlling interest in Nutrilite in 1972 and full ownership in 1994.

===International expansion===
Amway expanded to Australia in 1971, to parts of Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to Thailand in 1987, to China in 1995, to Africa in 1997, to India and Scandinavia in 1998, to Ukraine in 2003, to Russia in 2005, and to Vietnam in 2008.

In 2014, a Russian loyalty card program called &quot;Alfa-Amway&quot; was created when Amway joined with Alfa-Bank.

Amway was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the 42nd-largest privately held company in the United States in 2018, and as the number one largest company on the &quot;Direct Selling News&quot; Global 100 list in 2018.

===Quixtar===

The founders of the Amway corporation established a new holding company in 1999, named Alticor, and launched three new companies: a sister (and separate) Internet-focused company named Quixtar, Access Business Group, and Pyxis Innovations. Pyxis, later replaced by Fulton Innovation, pursued research and development and Access Business Group handled manufacturing and logistics for Amway, Quixtar, and third-party clients.

The main difference was that each &quot;Independent Business Owner&quot; (IBO) could order directly from Amway on the Internet, rather than from their upline &quot;direct distributor&quot;, and have products shipped directly to their home. The Amway name continued being used in the rest of the world. Virtually all Amway distributors in North America switched to Quixtar, prompting Alticor to close Amway North America after 2001. In June 2007, it was announced that the Quixtar brand would be phased out over an eighteen– to twenty-four–month period in favor of a unified Amway brand (Amway Global) worldwide.

==Global markets==
According to the Amway website, the company operated in over 100 countries and territories, organized into regional markets: the Americas, Europe, greater China, Japan and Korea, and SE Asia/Australia. Amway&#x27;s top ten markets are China, Korea, the United States, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, India, Russia, Malaysia and Italy. 

In 2008, Alticor announced that two-thirds of the company&#x27;s 58 markets reported sales increases, including strong growth in the China, Russia, Ukraine and India markets.

===Amway China===
Amway China launched in 1995. In 1998, after abuses of illegal pyramid schemes led to riots, the Chinese government enacted a ban on all direct selling companies, including Amway. After the negotiations, some companies like Amway, Avon, and Mary Kay continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force. China introduced new direct selling laws in December 2005, and in December 2006, Amway was one of the first companies to receive a license to resume direct sales. However, the law forbids teachers, doctors, and civil servants from becoming direct sales agents for the company and, unlike in the United States, salespeople in China are ineligible to receive commissions from sales made by the distributors they recruit.

In 2006, Amway China had a reported 180,000 sales representatives, 140 stores, and $2 billion in annual sales. In 2007, Amway Greater China and South-east Asia Chief Executive Eva Cheng was ranked no. 88 by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in its list of the World&#x27;s Most Powerful Women. In 2008, China was Amway&#x27;s largest market, reporting 28% growth and sales of 17 billion yuan (US$2.5 billion). According to a report in &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; in April 2010, Amway had 237 retail shops in China, 160,000 direct sales agents, and $3 billion in revenue. Since then, Amway has been continuing to expand in China, even as the government has been imposing greater restrictions on the company, and launched a WeChat mini-program in 2021.

==Brands==
Amway&#x27;s product line grew from LOC, with the laundry detergent SA8 added in 1960, and later the hair care product Satinique (1965) and the cosmetics line Artistry (1968).

In 2018, nutrition and wellness products were 52% of total sales, and beauty and personal care products were 26% of total sales. 

===Household cleaners===
Amway is best known in North America for its original multi-purpose cleaning product LOC, SA8 laundry detergent, and Dish Drops dishwashing liquid. Consumer Reports conducted blind testing of detergents in 2010 and ranked versions of Amway&#x27;s Legacy of Clean detergents 9th and 18th of 20 detergents tested. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; program manager Pat Slaven recommended against buying the products because consumers can &quot;go to the grocery store and get something that performs a whole lot better for a whole lot less money&quot;.

===Health and beauty===
Amway&#x27;s health and beauty brands include Artistry, Satinique, Hymm, Body Series, Glister, Moiskin (South America), Nutrilite, Nutriway (Scandinavia and Australia/New Zealand), Attitude (India), eSpring, Atmosphere and iCook as well as XL and XS Energy drinks. Other Amway brands that were discontinued or replaced include Tolsom, Eddie Funkhouser New York, or beautycycle (Eastern Europe).

====Artistry====

Amway&#x27;s Artistry products include skin care, cosmetics, and anti-aging creams and serums. In 2011, Artistry brand reached sales of $2.8 billion.

====Nutrilite====

Amway&#x27;s largest-selling brand is the Nutrilite range of health supplements (marketed as Nutriway in some countries), and in 2008 Nutrilite sales exceeded $3 billion globally. In 2001, NSF International issued its first five dietary supplement certifications to Nutrilite.

In 2011, Nutrilite brand of vitamins and dietary supplements led Amway&#x27;s sales, totaling almost $4.7 billion. According to Euromonitor International, in 2014, Nutrilite was the world&#x27;s No. 1 selling vitamins and dietary supplements brand. In 2015, it was reported that according to Euromonitor International, Amway was the largest vitamin and dietary supplement vendor in China, with 11% of a market that generated 100 billion yuan ($15.6 billion) in annual sales. In 2015, it was reported that according to China Confidential consumer brands survey, Amway Nutrilite was the most popular vitamin and dietary supplement brand in China.

In January 2009, Amway announced a voluntary recall of Nutrilite and XS Energy Bars after learning that they had possibly been manufactured with Salmonella-contaminated ingredients from Peanut Corporation of America. The company indicated that it had not received any reports of illness in connection with the products.

In 2012, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), accused Amway of making unsubstantiated and illegal claims about Nutrilite Fruits &amp; Vegetables 2GO Twist Tubes and threatened to launch a class action lawsuit against the company unless it took remedial action. Amway responded that the claims made about the products were properly substantiated and that they did not plan to change the product&#x27;s labeling but nevertheless would review the statements that CSPI has questioned. CSPI later reported that Amway had agreed to changing product labels by the end of 2014.

===eSpring===
Amway&#x27;s eSpring water filter was introduced in 2000. According to Amway, it was the first system to combine a carbon block filter and ultraviolet light with electronic-monitoring technology in the filter cartridge and it became the first home system to achieve certification for ANSI/NSF Standards 42, 53, and 55. According to Amway, eSpring was the first water treatment system to receive certification for all fifteen NSF/ANSI 401 contaminants which include pharmaceuticals, pesticides and herbicides. The company also claims that, in addition to these 15 contaminants, eSpring is certified for more than 145 potential contaminants, including lead and mercury.

eSpring was the first commercial product which employed Fulton Innovation&#x27;s eCoupled wireless power induction technology. Companies licensing this technology include Visteon, Herman Miller, Motorola and Mobility Electronics. Fulton was a founding member of the Wireless Power Consortium which developed the Qi (inductive power standard).

In 2007 eSpring was ranked fifth out of 27 brands in a comparison of water filters by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;.

===XS===
On January 14, 2015, Amway announced that it had acquired XS Energy, a California-based brand of energy drinks and snacks. The XS Energy brand has been sold as an Amway product since 2003. As of January 2015, it has been distributed in 38 countries, generating annual sales of $150 million.

According to Euromonitor International, the XS Energy was the first exclusively sugar-free energy drink brand sold globally.

==Ditto Delivery==
Ditto Delivery is Alticor&#x27;s automatic, monthly replenishment program that fills orders based on customers&#x27; predetermined needs. As of May 2001, Ditto Delivery accounted for 30% of Quixtar&#x27;s North American sales.

==Business model==
Amway combines direct selling with a multi-level marketing strategy. Amway distributors, referred to as &quot;independent business owners&quot; (IBOs), may market products directly to potential customers and may also sponsor and mentor other people to become IBOs. IBOs may earn income both from the retail markup on any products they sell personally, plus a performance bonus based on the sales volume they and their downline (IBOs they have sponsored) have generated. People may also register as IBOs to buy products at discounted prices. Harvard Business School, which described Amway as &quot;one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world&quot;, noted that Amway founders Van Andel and DeVos &quot;accomplished their success through the use of an elaborate pyramid-like distribution system in which independent distributors of Amway products received a percentage of the merchandise they sold and also a percentage of the merchandise sold by recruited distributors&quot;.

==Sports sponsorships==

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Amway sponsored racing driver Scott Brayton in the CART IndyCar championship.

In December 2006, Alticor secured the naming rights for the Orlando Magic&#x27;s home basketball arena in Orlando, Florida. The Orlando Magic is owned by the DeVos family. The arena, formerly known as the TD Waterhouse Centre, was renamed the Amway Arena. Its successor, the Amway Center, was opened in 2010, and the older arena was demolished in 2012 and held the naming rights until December 2023 when Kia bought the rights.

In 2009, Amway Global signed a three-year deal with the San Jose Earthquakes Major League Soccer team to become the jersey sponsor.

In March 2009, Amway Global signed a multi-year deal to become the presenting partner of the Los Angeles Sol of Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer. The deal, however, would last only one year, as the Sol folded in 2010.

In 2011, Amway signed a three-year deal to be the presenting sponsor of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings.

==Politics and culture==
===Political contributions===
In the 1990s, the Amway organization was a major contributor to the Republican Party (GOP) and to the election campaigns of various GOP candidates. Amway and its sales force contributed a substantial amount (up to half) of the total funds ($669,525) for the 1994 political campaign of Republican congresswoman and Amway distributor Sue Myrick (N.C.). According to two reports by &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine, Amway distributor Dexter Yager &quot;used the company&#x27;s extensive voice-mail system to rally hundreds of Amway distributors into giving a total of $295,871&quot; to Myrick&#x27;s campaign. According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes. Following the 1994 election, Myrick maintained &quot;close ties to Amway and Yager&quot;, and raised $100,000 from Amway sources, &quot;most notably through fundraisers at the homes of big distributors&quot;, in the 1997–98 election cycle.

In October 1994, Amway gave the biggest corporate contribution recorded to that date to a political party for a single election, $2.5 million to the Republican National Committee (RNC), and was the number one corporate political donor in the United States. In the 2004 election cycle, the organization contributed a total of $4 million to a conservative 527 group, Progress for America.

In July 1996, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos was honored at a $3 million fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a week later, it was reported that Amway had tried to donate $1.3 million to pay for Republican &quot;infomercials&quot; and televising of the GOP convention on Pat Robertson&#x27;s Family Channel, but backed off when Democrats criticized the donation as a ploy to avoid campaign-finance restrictions.

In April 1997, Richard DeVos and his wife, Helen, gave $1 million to the RNC, which, at the time, was the second-largest soft-money donation ever, behind Amway&#x27;s 1994 gift of $2.5 million to the RNC. In July 1997, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Newt Gingrich slipped a last-minute provision into a hotly contested compromise tax bill that granted Amway and four other companies a tax break on their Asian branches that totaled $19 million.

In a column published in the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; newspaper in August 1997, reporter Molly Ivins wrote that Amway had &quot;its own caucus in Congress...Five Republican House members are also Amway distributors: Reps. Sue Myrick of North Carolina, Jon Christensen of Nebraska, Dick Chrysler of Michigan, Richard Pombo of California, and John Ensign of Nevada. Their informal caucus meets several times a year with Amway bigwigs to discuss policy matters affecting the company, including China&#x27;s trade status.&quot;

A 1998 analysis of campaign contributions conducted by &quot;Businessweek&quot; found that Amway, along with the founding families and some top distributors, had donated at least $7 million to GOP causes in the preceding decade. Political candidates who received campaign funding from Amway in 1998 included Representatives Bill Redmond (R–N.M.), Heather Wilson (R–N.M.), and Jon Christensen (R–Neb).

According to a report by the Center for Public Integrity, in the 2004 election cycle, members of the Van Andel and DeVos families were the second, third and fifth largest donors to the Republican party.

Dick DeVos, son of Amway founder Richard DeVos and past president of the company, served as Finance Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and his wife Betsy DeVos served as chair of the Michigan Republican Party from 1996 to 2000 and 2003 to 2005.

In May 2005, Dick DeVos ran against incumbent Governor Jennifer Granholm in Michigan&#x27;s 2006 gubernatorial election. DeVos was defeated by Granholm, who won 56% of the popular vote to his 42%.

In August 2012, gay rights activist Fred Karger began a movement to boycott Amway in protest of the contribution from a private foundation of Amway President Doug DeVos to the National Organization for Marriage, a political organization which opposes legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States.

Betsy DeVos was United States Secretary of Education from 2017—2021 under the first Trump administration.

===Religion===
Several sources have commented on the promotion of Christian conservative ideology within the Amway organization. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine described the Amway distributor force as &quot;heavily influenced by the company&#x27;s dual themes of Christian morality and free enterprise&quot; and operating &quot;like a private political army&quot;. In &quot;The Cult of Free Enterprise&quot;, Stephen Butterfield, who spent time in the Yager group within Amway, wrote &quot;[Amway] sells a marketing and motivational system, a cause, a way of life, in a fervid emotional atmosphere of rallies and political religious revivalism.&quot; &quot;Philadelphia City Paper&quot; correspondent Maryam Henein stated that &quot;The language used in motivational tools for Amway frequently echoes or directly quotes the Bible, with the unstated assumption of a shared Christian perspective.&quot;

&quot;Businessweek&quot; correspondents Bill Vlasic and Beth Regan characterized the founding families of Amway as &quot;fervently conservative, fervently Christian, and hugely influential in the Republican Party&quot;, noting that &quot;Rich DeVos charged up the troops with a message of Christian beliefs and rock-ribbed conservatism.&quot;

High-ranking Amway leaders such as Richard DeVos and Dexter Yager were owners and members of the board of Gospel Films, a producer of movies and books geared toward conservative Christians, as well as co-owners (along with Salem Communications) of a right-wing, Christian nonprofit called Gospel Communications International. Yager, interviewed on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 1983, admitted that he promotes Christianity through his Amway group, but stated that this might not be the case in other Amway groups.

&quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; Bob Moser reported that former Amway CEO and co-founder Richard DeVos is connected with the Dominionist political movement in the United States. Moser states that DeVos was a supporter of the late D. James Kennedy, giving more than $5 million to Kennedy&#x27;s Coral Ridge Ministries. DeVos was also a founding member and two-time president of the Council for National Policy, a right-wing Christian organization.

Sociologist David G. Bromley calls Amway a &quot;quasi-religious corporation&quot; having sectarian characteristics. Bromley and Anson Shupe view Amway as preaching the gospel of prosperity. Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, reasoned that although some critics have referred to organizations such as Amway as &quot;cults&quot; and have speculated that they engage in &quot;mind control&quot;, there are other explanations that could account for the behavior of distributors. Namely, continued involvement of distributors despite minimal economic return may result from social satisfaction compensating for diminished economic satisfaction.

===Chamber of commerce===
Amway co-founder Jay Van Andel (in 1980), and later his son Steve Van Andel (in 2001), were elected by the board of directors of the United States Chamber of Commerce to be the chairman of the private American lobbying organization.

===Accreditation program===
In 2006, Amway (then Quixtar in North America) introduced its &quot;Professional Development Accreditation Program&quot; in response to concerns surrounding business support materials (BSM), including books, tapes and meetings. In 2010 this was superseded by its &quot;Accreditation Plus&quot; program to ensure that all BSM content is consistent with Amway&#x27;s quality assurance standards, which approved providers of BSM must abide by. The quality assurance standards state that
* Promoting political causes or other issues of a personal nature in the Amway Business environment is not permitted 
* Spiritual references are not allowed as the message or focus and presenters may not use the stage as a platform to promote religious and/or personal social beliefs
* Endorsement or denouncement of specific candidates, political parties, and/or issues, unless specifically related to the operation of an Amway Business is not allowed.

==Pyramid scheme allegations==
Robert Carroll, of the &quot;Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, has described Amway as a &quot;legal pyramid scheme&quot;, and has said that the quasi-religious devotion of its affiliates is used by the company to conceal poor performance rates by distributors.

===FTC investigation===

In a 1979 ruling, the Federal Trade Commission found that Amway did not fit the definition of a pyramid scheme because (a) distributors were not paid to recruit people, (b) it did not require distributors to buy a large stock of unmoving inventory, (c) distributors were required to maintain retail sales (at least 10 per month), and (d) the company and all distributors were required to accept returns of excess inventory from down-level distributors.

The FTC did, however, find Amway &quot;guilty of price-fixing and making exaggerated income claims&quot;; the company was ordered to stop retail price fixing and allocating customers among distributors and was prohibited from misrepresenting the amount of profit, earnings or sales its distributors are likely to achieve with the business. Amway was ordered to accompany any such statements with the actual averages per distributor, pointing out that more than half of the distributors do not make any money, with the average distributor making less than $100 per month. The order was violated with a 1986 ad campaign, resulting in a $100,000 fine.

Studies of independent consumer watchdog agencies have shown that between 990 and 999 of 1000 participants in MLMs that use Amway-type pay plans in fact lose money. According to The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary, &quot;In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission requires Amway to label its products with the message that 54% of Amway recruits make nothing and the rest earn on average $65 a month.&quot;

===Amway India===
In September 2006, following a public complaint, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana state police (CID) initiated raids and seizures against Amway distributors in the state, and submitted a petition against them, claiming the company violated the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act. They shut down all corporate offices associated with the Amway organization including the offices of some Amway distributors. The enforcement said that the business model of the company is illegal. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had notified the police that Amway in India may be violating certain laws regarding a &quot;money circulation scheme&quot; and the &quot;IB Times&quot; article writes that &quot;some say ... Amway is really more about making money from recruiting people to become distributors, as opposed to selling products&quot;. In 2008, the state government of Andhra Pradesh enacted a ban on Amway media advertisements.

On August 6, 2011, Kerala Police sealed the offices of Amway at Kozhikode, Kannur, Kochi, Kottayam, Thrissur, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram following complaints. In November 2012, the Economic Offences Wing of Kerala Police conducted searches at the offices of Amway at Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kannur as part of its crackdown on money chain activities and closed down the firm&#x27;s warehouses at these centres. Products valued at 21.4 million rupees (about US$400,000 at the time) were also seized. Later, Area manager of Amway, P. M. Rajkumar, who was arrested following searches was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

On May 27, 2013, Crime Branch officials of Kerala Police arrested William S. Pinckney, Managing Director &amp; CEO of Amway India Enterprises along with two other directors of the company from Kozhikode. The three were arrested on charges of running a pyramid scheme. They were granted bail the next day and the business was unaffected. On June 8, 2013, Kozhikode Court lifted the freeze on Amway offices in Kerala. On May 26, 2014, Pinckney was arrested by Andhra Pradesh police on the basis of a consumer complaint that alleged unethical circulation of money by Amway. He was subsequently arrested in other criminal cases registered against him in the state on allegations of financial irregularities by the company. Pinckney was jailed for two months until being released on bail.

In 2017, a Chandigarh court framed charges, under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code and the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Banning) Act, against two directors of Amway India, William Scot Pinckney and Prithvai Raj Bijlani. This was based on a cheating case filed by eight complainants in 2002, following which the Economic Offences Wing had filed chargesheet in 2012. A revision plea moved by the two Amway officials against the framed charges was dismissed in 2018.

In April 2022, the Enforcement Directorate attached both movable and immovable assets of Amway India worth including the firm&#x27;s factory in Dindigul along with bank accounts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

===U.S. class action settlement===
On November 3, 2010, Amway announced that it had agreed to pay $56 million—$34 million in cash and $22 million in products—to settle a class action that had been filed in Federal District Court in California in 2007. The class action, which had been brought against Quixtar and several of its top-level distributors, alleged fraud, racketeering, and that the defendants operated as an illegal pyramid scheme.

Amway, while noting that the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability, acknowledged that it had made changes to its business operations as a result of the lawsuit. The settlement is subject to approval by the court, which was expected in early 2011. The economic value of the settlement, including the changes Amway made to its business model, totals $100 million.

===Lobbying for deregulation===
The DeVoses supported an amendment to the US House of Representatives&#x27; omnibus Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 by US Representative John Moolenaar that would have limited the ability of the FTC to investigate whether MLMs are pyramid schemes. The amendment would have barred the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Small Business Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FTC, or any other agencies from using any monies to take enforcement actions against pyramid operations for the fiscal year. It also adopted provisions from H.R. 3409, the so-called &quot;Anti-Pyramid Scheme Promotion Act of 2016&quot;, which would blur the lines between legitimate MLM activity and pyramid schemes established under the original 1979 FTC case by deeming sales made to people inside the company as sales to an &quot;ultimate user,&quot; thus erasing the key distinction made in the ruling between sales to actual consumers of a product and sales made to members of the MLM network as part of recruitment of members or to qualify for commissions. The amendment was opposed by a coalition of consumer interest groups including Consumer Action, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union (the publisher of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine), Consumer Watchdog, the National Consumers League, and the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG), as well as Truth in Advertising (TINA.org) in its original incarnation.

==Other legal actions==
===Canadian tax fraud case===
In 1982, Amway co-founders, Richard M. DeVos and Jay Van Andel, along with Amway&#x27;s executive vice president for corporate services, William J. Discher Jr., were indicted in Canada on several criminal charges, including allegations that they underreported the value of goods brought into the country and had defrauded the Canadian government of more than $28 million from 1965 to 1980. The charges were dropped in 1983 after Amway and its Canadian subsidiary pleaded guilty to criminal customs fraud charges. The companies paid a fine of $25 million CAD, the largest fine ever imposed in Canada at the time. In 1989, the company settled the outstanding customs duties for $45 million CAD.

===RIAA lawsuit===
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), as part of its anti-piracy efforts, sued Amway and several distributors in 1996, alleging that copyrighted music was used on &quot;highly profitable&quot; training videotapes. Amway denied wrongdoing, blaming the case on a misunderstanding by distributors, and settled the case out of court for $9 million.

===Amway UK===
In 2007, Amway&#x27;s operations were halted in the United Kingdom and Ireland following a yearlong investigation by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, which moved to have Amway banned on the basis that the company had employed deceptive marketing, presented inflated earnings estimates, and lured distributors into buying bogus &quot;motivation and training&quot; tools. In 2008, a UK judge dismissed government claims against Amway&#x27;s operations, saying major reforms in the prior year (which included banning non-Amway-approved motivational events and materials) had fixed company faults that favoured selling training materials over products and misrepresented earnings. However, the judge also expressed his belief that Amway allowed &quot;misrepresentations&quot; of its business by independent sellers in years past and failed to act decisively against the misrepresentations.

===&quot;Welcome to Life&quot; (Poland)===
In 1997, Amway Poland and Network TwentyOne separately sued the makers of a Polish film, &quot;Welcome to Life&quot; (), for defamation and copyright violations. Henryk Dederko (the director) and producer were later acquitted on the charge of disseminating false information. The film, banned for 12 years, was one of the highly anticipated movies of 2009&#x27;s Warsaw Film Festival and was dubbed by the promoters as a &quot;scary movie about brainwashing&quot; It was said to depict hard-sell &quot;pep rallies&quot;, and to include statements from distributors that meetings had a similar tone to meetings of the Communist Party before it lost power in Poland. Methods of recruitment that confusingly resembled those of a sect were also described. A bestseller on the local video black market, the film was banned while the suit proceeded.

In 2001 a regional court ruled in favor of Network 21; however, in 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed Amway&#x27;s civil lawsuit. On appeal Amway won the case and the producers were ordered to pay a fine to a children&#x27;s charity and publish a public apology. the film was still banned due to an ongoing case brought by &quot;private individuals&quot; ridiculed in the film.

On December 18, 2012, the court ruled that film can be screened, but the makers have to remove &quot;untrue information&quot;, as the screen near the end of the movie stated that 30% of company income is generated by sales of training materials and that the vast majority of its profits are shared only by the tiny fraction of top distributors. This is not the only court case, so the film is still banned on other grounds.

===Dr. Phil and Shape Up===
In March 2004, TV personality Phil McGraw (a.k.a. Dr. Phil) pulled his &quot;Shape Up&quot; line of supplements off the market in the face of an investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The supplements were manufactured by CSA Nutraceuticals, a subsidiary of Alticor&#x27;s Access Business Group. The FTC later dropped the probe, but in October 2005 a class-action lawsuit was filed against McGraw by several people who used the products and claimed that the supplements, which cost $120 per month, did not stimulate weight loss. In September 2006, a $10.5 million settlement was reached, in which Alticor agreed to provide $4.5 million in cash and $6 million in Nutrilite products to disgruntled users of Shape Up.

===Procter &amp; Gamble===
Some Amway distributors distributed an urban legend that the (old) Procter &amp; Gamble service mark was in fact a Satanic symbol or that the CEO of P&amp;G is himself a practicing Satanist. (In some variants of the story, it is also claimed that the CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble donated &quot;satanic tithes&quot; to the Church of Satan.) Procter &amp; Gamble alleged that several Amway distributors were behind a resurgence of the story in the 1990s and sued several independent Amway distributors and the company for defamation and slander. The distributors had used Amway&#x27;s Amvox voice messaging service to send the rumor to their downline distributors in April 1995. By 2003, after more than a decade of lawsuits in multiple states, all allegations against Amway and Amway distributors had been dismissed. In October 2005, a Utah appeals court reversed part of the decision dismissing the case against the four Amway distributors, and remanded it to the lower court for further proceedings. In the lawsuit against the four former Amway distributors, Procter &amp; Gamble was awarded $19.25 million by a U.S. District Court jury in Salt Lake City on March 20, 2007. On November 24, 2008, the case was officially settled. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine they&#x27;d pursue it this long, especially after all the retractions we put out,&quot; said distributor Randy Haugen, a 53-year-old Ogden, Utah, businessman who maintained P&amp;G was never able to show how it was harmed by the rumors. &quot;We are stunned. All of us.&quot;

===Regulatory violations in Vietnam===
In January 2017, the Vietnam Ministry of Industry and Trade determined that Amway Vietnam had violated federal regulations by engaging in unauthorized multi-level marketing.

==Other issues==
===Cultism===
Some Amway distributor groups have been accused of using &quot;cult-like&quot; tactics to attract new distributors and keep them involved and committed. Allegations include resemblance to a Big Brother organization with a paranoid attitude toward insiders critical of the organization, seminars and rallies resembling religious revival meetings, and enormous involvement of distributors despite minimal incomes. An examination of the 1979–1980 tax records in the state of Wisconsin showed that the Direct Distributors reported a net loss of $918 on average.

===&quot;Dateline NBC&quot;===
In 2004, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; featured a critical report based on a yearlong undercover investigation of business practices of Quixtar. The report noted that the average distributor makes only about $1,400 per year and that many of the &quot;high level distributors singing the praises of Quixtar&quot; are actually &quot;making most of their money by selling motivational books, tapes and seminars; not Quixtar&#x27;s cosmetics, soaps, and electronics&quot;:

In fact, about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club; one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors don&#x27;t get to join. For years only a privileged few, including Bill Britt, have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books, tapes and seminars; things the rank and file distributors can&#x27;t sell themselves but, are told over and over again, they need to buy in order to succeed.

The program said that a Quixtar recruiter featured in the report made misleading and inconsistent statements about Quixtar earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding arrest warrant for cocaine possession from the mid-90s.

<doc id="1814" wikidata="Q9381" url="?curid=1814" title="Adam Smith">
<text>Adam Smith (baptised 1723 – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist and philosopher who was a pioneer in the thinking of political economy and key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Seen by some as &quot;The Father of Economics&quot; or &quot;The Father of Capitalism&quot;, he wrote two classic works, &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; (1759) and &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, is considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot; and the first modern work that treats economics as a comprehensive system and an academic discipline. Smith refuses to explain the distribution of wealth and power in terms of God&#x27;s will and instead appeals to natural, political, social, economic, legal, environmental and technological factors and the interactions among them. Among other economic theories, the work introduced Smith&#x27;s idea of absolute advantage.

Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.

As a reaction to the common policy of protecting national markets and merchants through minimizing imports and maximizing exports, what came to be known as mercantilism, Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as Horace Walpole.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, in Fife, Scotland. His father, Adam Smith senior, was a Scottish Writer to the Signet (senior solicitor), advocate and prosecutor (judge advocate) and also served as comptroller of the customs in Kirkcaldy. Smith&#x27;s mother was born Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife; she married Smith&#x27;s father in 1720. Two months before Smith was born, his father died, leaving his mother a widow. The date of Smith&#x27;s baptism into the Church of Scotland at Kirkcaldy was 5 June 1723 and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth, which is unknown.

Although few events in Smith&#x27;s early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist John Rae, Smith&#x27;s biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by Romani at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him. Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions. He attended the Burgh School of Kirkcaldy—characterised by Rae as &quot;one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period&quot;—from 1729 to 1737, he learned Latin, mathematics, history, and writing.

===Formal education===

Smith entered the University of Glasgow at age 14 and studied moral philosophy under Francis Hutcheson. Here he developed his passion for the philosophical concepts of reason, civilian liberties, and free speech. In 1740, he was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at Balliol College, Oxford, under the Snell Exhibition.

Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling. In Book V, Chapter II of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, he wrote: &quot;In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.&quot; Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of David Hume&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot;, and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it. According to William Robert Scott, &quot;The Oxford of [Smith&#x27;s] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework.&quot; Nevertheless, he took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Bodleian Library. When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters. Near the end of his time there, he began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.

In Book V of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at English universities, when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the Church of England.

===Teaching career===
Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 at the University of Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of Lord Kames. His lecture topics included rhetoric and &quot;belles-lettres&quot;, and later the subject of &quot;the progress of opulence&quot;. On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of &quot;the obvious and simple system of natural liberty&quot;. While Smith was not adept at public speaking, his lectures met with success.

In 1750, Smith met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.

In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching logic courses, and in 1752, he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow died the next year, Smith took over the position. He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as &quot;by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]&quot;.

Smith published &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined &quot;mutual sympathy&quot; as the basis of moral sentiments. He based his explanation, not on a special &quot;moral sense&quot; as the Third Lord Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had done, nor on utility as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of empathy, the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.
Following the publication of &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;, Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith. At this time, Smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals. For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation&#x27;s quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for mercantilism, the economic theory that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.

In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from British chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Townshend—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch as preparation for a career in international politics. Smith resigned from his professorship in 1764 to take the tutoring position. He subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he had resigned partway through the term, but his students refused.

===Tutoring, travels, European intellectuals===
Smith&#x27;s tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects. He was paid £300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher. Smith first travelled as a tutor to Toulouse, France, where he stayed for a year and a half. According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he &quot;had begun to write a book to pass away the time&quot;. After touring the south of France, the group moved to Geneva, where Smith met with the philosopher Voltaire.
From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here, Smith met American publisher and diplomat Benjamin Franklin, who a few years later would lead the opposition in the American colonies against four British resolutions from Charles Townshend (in history known as the Townshend Acts), which threatened American colonial self-government and imposed revenue duties on a number of items necessary to the colonies. Smith discovered the Physiocracy school founded by François Quesnay and discussed with their intellectuals. Physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism, the dominating economic theory of the time, illustrated in their motto &quot;Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!&quot; (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!).

The wealth of France had been virtually depleted by Louis XIV and Louis XV in ruinous wars, and was further exhausted in aiding the American revolutionary soldiers, against the British. Given that the British economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that &quot;with all its imperfections, [the Physiocratic school] is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy.&quot; The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic &quot;classe steril&quot;—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.

===Later years===
In 1766, Henry Scott&#x27;s younger brother died in Paris, and Smith&#x27;s tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter. Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next decade to writing his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. There, he befriended Henry Moyes, a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude. Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and Thomas Reid in the young man&#x27;s education. In May 1767, Smith was elected fellow of the Royal Society of London, and was elected a member of the Literary Club in 1775. &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.

In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother (who died in 1784) in Panmure House in Edinburgh&#x27;s Canongate. Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1787 to 1789, he occupied the honorary position of Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow.

===Death===

Smith died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness. His body was buried in the Canongate Kirkyard. On his deathbed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.

Smith&#x27;s literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist Joseph Black and the pioneering geologist James Hutton. Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication. He mentioned an early unpublished &quot;History of Astronomy&quot; as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as &quot;Essays on Philosophical Subjects&quot;.

Smith&#x27;s library went by his will to David Douglas, Lord Reston (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith. It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs. Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs. Bannerman). On the death in 1878 of her husband, the Reverend W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans, Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor Robert Oliver Cunningham of Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen&#x27;s College. After his death, the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879, her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church) in Edinburgh and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972.

==Personality and beliefs==

===Character===
Not much is known about Smith&#x27;s personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death, per his request. He never married, and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before him.

Smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of &quot;inexpressible benignity&quot;. He was known to talk to himself, a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions. He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study. According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a tanning factory, and while discussing free trade, Smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape. He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he had ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.

James Boswell, who was a student of Smith&#x27;s at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the Literary Club, says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told Sir Joshua Reynolds, that &quot;he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood&quot;.

Smith has been alternatively described as someone who &quot;had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment&quot; and one whose &quot;countenance was manly and agreeable&quot;. Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, &quot;I am a beau in nothing but my books.&quot; Smith rarely sat for portraits, so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by James Tassie and two etchings by John Kay. The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th-century reprints of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; were based largely on Tassie&#x27;s medallion.

===Religious views===
Considerable scholarly debate has occurred about the nature of Smith&#x27;s religious views. His father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the Church of Scotland, and the fact that he received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the Church of England.

Anglo-American economist Ronald Coase challenged the view that Smith was a deist, based on the fact that Smith&#x27;s writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds. According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the &quot;Great Architect of the Universe&quot;, later scholars such as Jacob Viner have &quot;very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God&quot;, a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the &quot;great phenomena of nature&quot;, such as &quot;the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals&quot;, has led men to &quot;enquire into their causes&quot;, and that &quot;superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods&quot;. Some authors argue that Smith&#x27;s social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God&#x27;s action in nature. Brendan Long argues that Smith was a theist, whereas according to professor Gavin Kennedy, Smith was &quot;in some sense&quot; a Christian.

Smith was also a close friend of David Hume, who, despite debate about his religious views in modern scholarship, was commonly characterised in his own time as an atheist. The publication in 1777 of Smith&#x27;s letter to William Strahan, in which he described Hume&#x27;s courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.

==Published works==

===&quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;===

In 1759, Smith published his first work, &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments,&quot; sold by co-publishers Andrew Millar of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh. Smith continued making extensive revisions to the book until his death. Although &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; is widely regarded as Smith&#x27;s most influential work, Smith himself is believed to have considered &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; to be a superior work.

In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek &quot;mutual sympathy of sentiments.&quot; His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind&#x27;s ability to form moral judgment, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgments they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback received by an individual from perceiving (or imagining) others&#x27; judgment creates an incentive to achieve &quot;mutual sympathy of sentiments&quot; with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one&#x27;s conscience.

Some scholars have perceived a conflict between &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; and &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest. In recent years, however, some scholars of Smith&#x27;s work have argued that no contradiction exists. They contend that in &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;, Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the &quot;impartial spectator&quot; as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; and &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. In the first part – &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; – he laid down the foundation of his vision of humanity and society. In the second – &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; – he elaborated on the virtue of prudence, which for him meant the relations between people in the private sphere of the economy. It was his plan to further elaborate on the virtue of justice in the third book. Otteson argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar &quot;market model&quot; for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language. Ekelund and Hebert offer a differing view, observing that self-interest is present in both works and that &quot;in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest.&quot;

===&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;===
Disagreement exists between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith&#x27;s most influential work: &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776). Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith&#x27;s invisible hand, a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – Book IV, Chapter II – and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the &quot;wealth of nations&quot; in the first sentences, which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour. He elaborated on the virtue of prudence, which for him meant the relations between people in the private sphere of the economy. He planned to further elaborate on the virtue of justice in the third book.

Smith used the term &quot;the invisible hand&quot; in &quot;History of Astronomy&quot; referring to &quot;the invisible hand of Jupiter&quot;, and once in each of his &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; (1759) and &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776). This last statement about &quot;an invisible hand&quot; has been interpreted in numerous ways.
As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.

Those who regard that statement as Smith&#x27;s central message also quote frequently Smith&#x27;s dictum:

It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.However, in &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; he had a more sceptical approach to self-interest as driver of behaviour:How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.
In relation to Mandeville&#x27;s contention that &quot;Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits&quot;, Smith&#x27;s belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their &quot;conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices.&quot; Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or monopolies, fixing the highest price &quot;which can be squeezed out of the buyers.&quot; Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants &quot;in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention.&quot; Thus Smith&#x27;s chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:

It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (&quot;The Wealth of Nations,&quot; I.i.10)

The neoclassical interest in Smith&#x27;s statement about &quot;an invisible hand&quot; originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its concept of general equilibrium; Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;Economics&quot; refers six times to Smith&#x27;s &quot;invisible hand&quot;. To emphasise this connection, Samuelson quotes Smith&#x27;s &quot;invisible hand&quot; statement substituting &quot;general interest&quot; for &quot;public interest&quot;. Samuelson concludes: &quot;Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.&quot;
Conversely, classical economists see in Smith&#x27;s first sentences his programme to promote &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, François Quesnay, whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; to him had he not died beforehand. To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—&quot;general plenty&quot; and &quot;universal opulence&quot;—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith&#x27;s central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. Smith&#x27;s argument predicted Britain&#x27;s evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; summarise this policy:

The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;
* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,
* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].

However, Smith added that the &quot;abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.&quot;

In &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, Smith states four maxims of taxation: (1) equality (people must contribute to the support of the government in proportion to their abilities), (2) certainty (the time, manner, and quantity of tax imposed must be certain, transparent, and not arbitrary), (3) convenience for taxpayers, and (4) economy in tax collection. According to Smith, &quot;It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more in that proportion&quot;.

Smith wrote that a government is duty-bound to provide public services that &quot;support the whole of society&quot; like provide public education, transportation, national defense, a justice system, public safety, and public infrastructure to support commerce.

===Other works===
Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published &quot;Essays on Philosophical Subjects&quot;, a history of astronomy down to Smith&#x27;s own era, plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics, probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. &quot;Lectures on Jurisprudence&quot; were notes taken from Smith&#x27;s early lectures, plus an early draft of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include &quot;Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms&quot; (1763) (first published in 1896); and &quot;Essays on Philosophical Subjects&quot; (1795).

==Legacy==

===In economics and moral philosophy===
&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests. In 2005, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.

In light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the Industrial Revolution, Britain embraced free trade and Smith&#x27;s &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics, and via the British Empire, used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.

George Stigler attributes to Smith &quot;the most important substantive proposition in all of economics&quot;. It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.

Paul Samuelson finds in Smith&#x27;s pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of Walras a century later. Smith&#x27;s allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with Malthus, Ricardo, and Karl Marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.

Joseph Schumpeter criticised Smith for a lack of technical rigour, yet he argued that this enabled Smith&#x27;s writings to appeal to wider audiences: &quot;His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.&quot;

Classical economists presented competing theories to those of Smith, termed the &quot;labour theory of value&quot;. Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith&#x27;s labour theories, in part. The first volume of Karl Marx&#x27;s major work, &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital. The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics, that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.

The body of theory later termed &quot;neoclassical economics&quot; or &quot;marginalism&quot; formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term &quot;economics&quot; was popularised by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall as a concise synonym for &quot;economic science&quot; and a substitute for the earlier, broader term &quot;political economy&quot; used by Smith. This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences. Neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the labour theory of value of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.

The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; and &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;, and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His &quot;homo economicus&quot; or &quot;economic man&quot; was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in &quot;The Secret History of the Dismal Science&quot; point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith&#x27;s opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. Emphasised also are Smith&#x27;s statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The &quot;Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics&quot;, Peart and Levy also cite Smith&#x27;s view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher, and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith&#x27;s opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.

Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:

Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days&#x27; labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.

===In British imperial debates===
Smith opposed empire. He challenged ideas that colonies were key to British prosperity and power. He rejected that other cultures, such as China and India, were culturally and developmentally inferior to Europe. While he favoured &quot;commercial society&quot;, he did not support radical social change and the imposition of commercial society on other societies. He proposed that colonies be given independence or that full political rights be extended to colonial subjects.

Smith&#x27;s chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire&#x27;s 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith&#x27;s second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.

Smith&#x27;s most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate Richard Cobden, preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the Anti-Corn Law League in overturning the Corn Laws in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire &quot;on the cheap&quot; for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as Cobdenism or the Manchester School. By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith&#x27;s second proposal such as Joseph Shield Nicholson would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation. As Marc-William Palen notes: &quot;On the one hand, Adam Smith&#x27;s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire &#x27;on the cheap&#x27;. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith&#x27;s theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before.&quot; Smith&#x27;s ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.

===Portraits, monuments, and banknotes===
Smith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the £50 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank in Scotland, and in March 2007 Smith&#x27;s image also appeared on the new series of £20 notes issued by the Bank of England, making him the first Scotsman to feature on an English banknote.

Between 1867 and 1870, a statue of Smith was built into the outside wall of 6 Burlington Gardens, then the headquarters of the University of London (now home to the Royal Academy of Arts). A large-scale memorial of Smith by Alexander Stoddart was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a -tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the Royal Mile outside St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in Parliament Square, near the Mercat cross. Sculptor Jim Sanborn has created multiple pieces which feature Smith&#x27;s work. At Central Connecticut State University is &quot;Circulating Capital&quot;, a tall cylinder which features an extract from &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; on the lower half, and on the upper half, some of the same text, but represented in binary code. At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, outside the Belk College of Business Administration, is &quot;Adam Smith&#x27;s Spinning Top&quot;. Another Smith sculpture is at Cleveland State University. Smith also appears as the narrator in the 2013 play &quot;The Low Road&quot;, centred on a proponent on &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics in the late 18th century, but dealing obliquely with the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession; he was portrayed by Bill Paterson in the premiere production at the Royal Court Theatre in London.

A bust of Smith is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling. Five paving stones, displaying quotations from Smith&#x27;s works, were unveiled in December 2023 in the High Street, Glasgow. The stones were commissioned by the University of Glasgow to mark the 300th anniversary of Smith&#x27;s birth.

===Panmure House===
Adam Smith resided at Panmure House from 1778 to 1790. In 2008, the house was purchased by the Edinburgh Business School at Heriot-Watt University and funds were raised for its restoration. In 2018 it was formally opened as a study centre in Smith&#x27;s honour.

===As a symbol of free-market economics===
Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute in London, multiple entities known as the &quot;Adam Smith Society&quot;, including an historical Italian organisation, and the U.S.-based Adam Smith Society, and the Australian Adam Smith Club, and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.

Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan argues that, while Smith did not coin the term &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, &quot;it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions.&quot; Greenspan continues that &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was &quot;one of the great achievements in human intellectual history.&quot; P.J. O&#x27;Rourke describes Smith as the &quot;founder of free market economics.&quot;

Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman believed in 1976, 200 years after the publishing of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, that the work of Adam Smith was, &quot;...far more immediately relevant today than he was at the Centennial of The Wealth of Nations in 1876.&quot;

Other writers have argued that Smith&#x27;s support for &quot;laissez-faire&quot; (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. Herbert Stein wrote that the people who &quot;wear an Adam Smith necktie&quot; do it to &quot;make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government&quot;, and that this misrepresents Smith&#x27;s ideas. Stein writes that Smith &quot;was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.&quot; In Stein&#x27;s reading, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; could justify the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and &quot;discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior&quot;.

Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in &quot;The Economic Journal&quot; that in the 20th-century United States, Reaganomics supporters, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an &quot;extreme dogmatic defender of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism and supply-side economics&quot;. In fact, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:

The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.

Some commentators have argued that Smith&#x27;s works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them luxury-goods taxes and tax on rent. Yet Smith argued for the &quot;impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation&quot;. Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting &quot;justice&quot; and &quot;certain publick institutions&quot; that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise.

Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in &quot;The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I&quot;. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods &quot;of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual&quot; such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: &quot;Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state&quot; (&quot;Wealth of Nations,&quot; V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because &quot;we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a doge&quot;. In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:

The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.

However, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff &quot;seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them&quot;.

Economic historians such as Jacob Viner regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called &quot;natural liberty&quot;), but not as a dogmatic supporter of &quot;laissez-faire&quot;.

Economist Daniel Klein believes using the term &quot;free-market economics&quot; or &quot;free-market economist&quot; to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith&#x27;s economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the &quot;Smithian&quot; identity. Economist David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith&#x27;s thoughts on free market. Many continue to fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help. Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.

Some have also claimed, Emma Rothschild among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage, although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:

The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, Book 1, Chapter 8)

However, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power:
A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.

<doc id="1822" wikidata="Q39607" url="?curid=1822" title="Antoine Lavoisier">
<text>Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier ( ; ; 26 August 17438 May 1794), also Antoine Lavoisier after the French Revolution, was a French nobleman and chemist who was central to the 18th-century chemical revolution and who had a large influence on both the history of chemistry and the history of biology.

It is generally accepted that Lavoisier&#x27;s great accomplishments in chemistry stem largely from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one. Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion. He named oxygen (1778), recognizing it as an element, and also recognized hydrogen as an element (1783), opposing the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier helped construct the metric system, wrote the first extensive list of elements, and helped to reform chemical nomenclature. He predicted the existence of silicon (1787) and discovered that, although matter may change its form or shape, its mass always remains the same. His wife and laboratory assistant, Marie-Anne Paulze Lavoisier, became a renowned chemist in her own right.

Lavoisier was a powerful member of a number of aristocratic councils, and an administrator of the &quot;Ferme générale&quot;. The &quot;Ferme générale&quot; was one of the most hated components of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents. All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research. At the height of the French Revolution, he was charged with tax fraud and selling adulterated tobacco, and was guillotined despite appeals to spare his life in recognition of his contributions to science. A year and a half later, he was exonerated by the French government.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier was born to a wealthy family of the nobility in Paris on 26 August 1743. The son of an attorney at the Parlement of Paris, he inherited a large fortune at the age of five upon the death of his mother. Lavoisier began his schooling at the Collège des Quatre-Nations, University of Paris (also known as the Collège Mazarin) in Paris in 1754 at the age of 11. In his last two years (1760–1761) at the school, his scientific interests were aroused, and he studied chemistry, botany, astronomy, and mathematics. In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation, an enthusiasm which never left him. Lavoisier entered the school of law, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764. Lavoisier received a law degree and was admitted to the bar, but never practiced as a lawyer. However, he continued his scientific education in his spare time.

===Early scientific work===
Lavoisier&#x27;s education was filled with the ideals of the French Enlightenment of the time, and he was fascinated by Pierre Macquer&#x27;s dictionary of chemistry. He attended lectures in the natural sciences. Lavoisier&#x27;s devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by Étienne Condillac, a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. From 1763 to 1767, he studied geology under Jean-Étienne Guettard. In collaboration with Guettard, Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of Alsace-Lorraine in June 1767. In 1764 he read his first paper to the French Academy of Sciences, France&#x27;s most elite scientific society, on the chemical and physical properties of gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate), and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the King for an essay on the problems of urban street lighting. In 1768 Lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the Academy of Sciences. In 1769, he worked on the first geological map of France.

===Lavoisier as a social reformer===
====Research benefitting the public good====
While Lavoisier is commonly known for his contributions to the sciences, he also dedicated a significant portion of his fortune and work toward benefitting the public. Lavoisier was a humanitarian—he cared deeply about the people in his country and often concerned himself with improving the livelihood of the population by agriculture, industry, and the sciences. The first instance of this occurred in 1765, when he submitted an essay on improving urban street lighting to the French Academy of Sciences.

Three years later in 1768, he focused on a new project to design an aqueduct. The goal was to bring water from the river Yvette into Paris so that the citizens could have clean drinking water. But, since the construction never commenced, he instead turned his focus to purifying the water from the Seine. This was the project that interested Lavoisier in the chemistry of water and public sanitation duties.

Additionally, he was interested in air quality and spent some time studying the health risks associated with gunpowder&#x27;s effect on the air. In 1772, he performed a study on how to reconstruct the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, after it had been damaged by fire, in a way that would allow proper ventilation and clean air throughout.

At the time, the prisons in Paris were known to be largely unlivable and the prisoners&#x27; treatment inhumane. Lavoisier took part in investigations in 1780 (and again in 1791) on the hygiene in prisons and had made suggestions to improve living conditions, suggestions which were largely ignored.

Once a part of the academy, Lavoisier also held his own competitions to push the direction of research towards bettering the public and his own work.

====Sponsorship of the sciences====
Lavoisier had a vision of public education having roots in &quot;scientific sociability&quot; and philanthropy.

Lavoisier gained a vast majority of his income through buying stock in the General Farm, which allowed him to work on science full-time, live comfortably, and allowed him to contribute financially to better the community. (It would also contribute to his demise during the Reign of Terror many years later.)

It was very difficult to secure public funding for the sciences at the time, and additionally not very financially profitable for the average scientist, so Lavoisier used his wealth to open a very expensive and sophisticated laboratory in France so that aspiring scientists could study without the barriers of securing funding for their research.

He also pushed for public education in the sciences. He founded two organizations, and Musée des Arts et Métiers, which were created to serve as educational tools for the public. Funded by the wealthy and noble, the Lycée regularly taught courses to the public beginning in 1793.

===Ferme générale and marriage===
At the age of 26, around the time he was elected to the Academy of Sciences, Lavoisier bought a share in the &quot;Ferme générale&quot;, a tax farming financial company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes. On behalf of the Ferme générale Lavoisier commissioned the building of a wall around Paris so that customs duties could be collected from those transporting goods into and out of the city. His participation in the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the Reign of Terror began in France, as taxes and poor government reform were the primary motivators during the French Revolution.

Lavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when, in 1771 at age 28, he married Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, the 13-year-old daughter of a senior member of the &quot;Ferme générale&quot;. She was to play an important part in Lavoisier&#x27;s scientific career—notably, she translated English documents for him, including Richard Kirwan&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Phlogiston&quot; and Joseph Priestley&#x27;s research. In addition, she assisted him in the laboratory and created many sketches and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues for their scientific works. Madame Lavoisier edited and published Antoine&#x27;s memoirs (whether any English translations of those memoirs have survived is unknown as of today) and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry.

A portrait of Antoine and Marie-Anne Lavoisier was painted by the famed artist Jacques-Louis David. Completed in 1788 on the eve of the Revolution, the painting was denied a customary public display at the Paris Salon for fear that it might inflame anti-aristocratic passions.

For three years following his entry into the &quot;Ferme générale&quot;, Lavoisier&#x27;s scientific activity diminished somewhat, for much of his time was taken up with official &quot;Ferme générale&quot; business. He did, however, present one important memoir to the Academy of Sciences during this period, on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation. By a very precise quantitative experiment, Lavoisier showed that the &quot;earthy&quot; sediment produced after long-continued reflux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water. He also attempted to introduce reforms in the French monetary and taxation system to help the peasants.

===Adulteration of tobacco===
The Farmers General held a monopoly of the production, import and sale of tobacco in France, and the taxes they levied on tobacco brought revenues of 30 million livres a year. This revenue began to fall because of a growing black market in tobacco that was smuggled and adulterated, most commonly with ash and water. Lavoisier devised a method of checking whether ash had been mixed in with tobacco: &quot;When a spirit of vitriol, &quot;aqua fortis&quot; or some other acid solution is poured on ash, there is an immediate very intense effervescent reaction, accompanied by an easily detected noise.&quot;

Lavoisier also noticed that the addition of a small amount of ash improved the flavour of tobacco. Of one vendor selling adulterated goods, he wrote &quot;His tobacco enjoys a very good reputation in the province... the very small proportion of ash that is added gives it a particularly pungent flavour that consumers look for. Perhaps the Farm could gain some advantage by adding a bit of this liquid mixture when the tobacco is fabricated.&quot; Lavoisier also found that while adding a lot of water to bulk the tobacco up would cause it to ferment and smell bad, the addition of a very small amount improved the product.

Thereafter the factories of the Farmers General added, as he recommended, a consistent 6.3% of water by volume to the tobacco they processed. To allow for this addition, the Farmers General delivered to retailers seventeen ounces of tobacco while only charging for sixteen. To ensure that only these authorised amounts were added, and to exclude the black market, Lavoisier saw to it that a watertight system of checks, accounts, supervision and testing made it very difficult for retailers to source contraband tobacco or to improve their profits by bulking it up.

He was energetic and rigorous in implementing this, and the systems he introduced were deeply unpopular with the tobacco retailers across the country. This unpopularity was to have consequences for him during the French Revolution.

===Royal Commission on Agriculture===
Lavoisier urged the establishment of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was unrealistic to expect them to change their traditional practices.

===Gunpowder Commission===
Lavoisier&#x27;s researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties, especially in connection with the &quot;Ferme Générale&quot;. There were also innumerable reports for and committees of the Academy of Sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government. Lavoisier, whose organizing skills were outstanding, frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports. In 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company, similar to the Ferme Générale, which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying France with its munitions requirements. As a result of his efforts, both the quantity and quality of French gunpowder greatly improved, and it became a source of revenue for the government. His appointment to the Gunpowder Commission brought one great benefit to Lavoisier&#x27;s scientific career as well. As a commissioner, he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the Royal Arsenal. Here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792.

Lavoisier was a formative influence in the formation of the Du Pont gunpowder business because he trained Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, its founder, on gunpowder-making in France; the latter said that the Du Pont gunpowder mills &quot;would never have been started but for his kindness to me.&quot;

===During the Revolution===
In June 1791, Lavoisier made a loan of 71,000 livres to Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to buy a printing works so that du Pont could publish a newspaper, &quot;La Correspondance Patriotique&quot;. The plan was for this to include both reports of debates in the National Constituent Assembly as well as papers from the Academy of Sciences. The revolution quickly disrupted the elder du Pont&#x27;s first newspaper, but his son E.I. du Pont soon launched &quot;Le Republicain&quot; and published Lavoisier&#x27;s latest chemistry texts.

Lavoisier also chaired the commission set up to establish a uniform system of weights and measures which in March 1791 recommended the adoption of the metric system. The new system of weights and measures was adopted by the Convention on 1 August 1793. Lavoisier was one of the 27 Farmers General who, by order of the convention, were all to be detained. Although temporarily going into hiding, on 30 November 1793 he handed himself into the Port Royal convent for questioning. He claimed he had not operated on this commission for many years, having instead devoted himself to science.

Lavoisier himself was removed from the commission on weights and measures on 23 December 1793, together with mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace and several other members, for political reasons.

One of his last major works was a proposal to the National Convention for the reform of French education. He also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign-born scientists including mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange, helping to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom.

===Final days and execution===
As the French Revolution gained momentum, attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular &quot;Ferme générale&quot;, and it was eventually abolished in March 1791. In 1792 Lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the Gunpowder Commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the Royal Arsenal. On 8 August 1793, all the learned societies, including the Academy of Sciences, were suppressed at the request of Abbé Grégoire.

On 24 November 1793, the arrest of all the former tax farmers was ordered. Lavoisier and the other Farmers General faced nine accusations of defrauding the state of money owed to it, and of adding water to tobacco before selling it. Lavoisier drafted their defense, refuting the financial accusations, reminding the court of how they had maintained a consistently high quality of tobacco. The court, however, was inclined to believe that by condemning them and seizing the goods of the Farmers General, it would recover huge sums for the state. Lavoisier was convicted and guillotined on 8 May 1794 in Paris, at the age of 50, along with his 27 co-defendants.

According to popular legend, the appeal to spare his life, in order that he could continue his experiments, was cut short by the judge, Coffinhal: &quot;La République n&#x27;a pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes; le cours de la justice ne peut être suspendu.&quot; (&quot;The Republic needs neither scholars nor chemists; the course of justice cannot be delayed.&quot;) The judge Coffinhal himself would be executed less than three months later, in the wake of the Thermidorian reaction.

Lavoisier&#x27;s importance to science was expressed by Lagrange who lamented the beheading by saying: &quot;Il ne leur a fallu qu&#x27;un moment pour faire tomber cette tête, et cent années peut-être ne suffiront pas pour en reproduire une semblable.&quot; (&quot;It took them only an instant to cut off this head, and a hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like.&quot;)

====Exoneration====
A year and a half after his execution, Lavoisier was completely exonerated by the French government. During the White Terror, his belongings were delivered to his widow. A brief note was included, reading &quot;To the widow of Lavoisier, who was falsely convicted&quot;.

==== Blinking experiment ====
An apocryphal story exists regarding Lavoisier&#x27;s execution in which the scientist blinked his eyes to demonstrate that the head retained some consciousness after being severed. Some variants of the story include Joseph-Louis Lagrange as being the scientist to observe and record Lavoisier&#x27;s blinking. This story was not recorded in contemporary accounts of Lavoisier&#x27;s death, and the execution site was too removed from the public for Lagrange to have viewed Lavoisier&#x27;s alleged experiment. The story likely originated in a 1990s Discovery Channel documentary about guillotines and then subsequently spread online, becoming what one source describes as an urban legend.

==Contributions to chemistry==

===Oxygen theory of combustion===
Contrary to prevailing thought at the time, Lavoisier theorized that common air, or one of its components, combines with substances when they are burned. He demonstrated this through experiment.

During late 1772 Lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of combustion, the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science. He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October, in which he reported that when phosphorus burned, it combined with a large quantity of air to produce acid spirit of phosphorus, and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning. In a second sealed note deposited with the academy a few weeks later (1 November) Lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of sulfur and went on to add that &quot;what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination: and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause.&quot;

====Joseph Black&#x27;s &quot;fixed air&quot;====
During 1773 Lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air, particularly &quot;fixed air,&quot; and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field. He published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled &quot;Opuscules physiques et chimiques&quot; (Physical and Chemical Essays). In the course of this review, he made his first full study of the work of Joseph Black, the Scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies. Black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali, for example, chalk (CaCO3), and the caustic form, for example, quicklime (CaO), lay in the fact that the former contained &quot;fixed air,&quot; not common air fixed in the chalk, but a distinct chemical species, now understood to be carbon dioxide (CO2), which was a constituent of the atmosphere. Lavoisier recognized that Black&#x27;s fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be Black&#x27;s fixed air, that is, CO2.

====Joseph Priestley====

In the spring of 1774, Lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels, the results of which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air. But the question remained about whether it was in combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air. In October the English chemist Joseph Priestley visited Paris, where he met Lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the red calx of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor. Priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas, but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air. Lavoisier carried out his own research on this peculiar substance. The result was his memoir &quot;On the Nature of the Principle Which Combines with Metals during Their Calcination and Increases Their Weight&quot;, read to the Academy on 26 April 1775 (commonly referred to as the Easter Memoir). In the original memoir, Lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with charcoal, giving off Black&#x27;s fixed air in the process. When reduced without charcoal, it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way. He concluded that this was just a pure form of common air and that it was the air itself &quot;undivided, without alteration, without decomposition&quot; which combined with metals on calcination.

After returning from Paris, Priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx. His results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was &quot;five or six times better than common air, for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and ... every other use of common air&quot;. He called the air dephlogisticated air, as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston. Since it was therefore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals, the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained.

===Pioneer of stoichiometry===
Lavoisier&#x27;s researches included some of the first truly quantitative chemical experiments. He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no gases could escape, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. In 1774, he showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the total mass of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical change. Thus, for instance, if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged if gaseous reactants and products are included. Lavoisier&#x27;s experiments supported the law of conservation of mass. In France it is taught as Lavoisier&#x27;s Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his &quot;Traité Élémentaire de Chimie&quot;: &quot;Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.&quot; Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–1765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments; others whose ideas pre-date the work of Lavoisier include Jean Rey (1583–1645), Joseph Black (1728–1799), and Henry Cavendish (1731–1810).

===Chemical nomenclature===

Lavoisier, together with Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude-Louis Berthollet, and Antoine François de Fourcroy, submitted a new program for the reforms of chemical nomenclature to the academy in 1787, for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time. This work, titled &quot;Méthode de nomenclature chimique&quot; (&quot;Method of Chemical Nomenclature&quot;, 1787), introduced a new system which was tied inextricably to Lavoisier&#x27;s new oxygen theory of chemistry.

The classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water were discarded, and instead some 33 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements. The elements included light; caloric (matter of heat); the principles of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote (nitrogen); carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown &quot;radicals&quot; of muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid), boric acid, and &quot;fluoric&quot; acid; 17 metals; 5 earths (mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as magnesia, baria, and strontia); three alkalies (potash, soda, and ammonia); and the &quot;radicals&quot; of 19 organic acids.

The acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids, phosphoric and phosphorous acids, nitric and nitrous acids, the &quot;ic&quot; termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the &quot;ous&quot; ending.

Similarly, salts of the &quot;ic&quot; acids were given the terminal letters &quot;ate,&quot; as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the &quot;ous&quot; acids terminated with the suffix &quot;ite,&quot; as in copper sulfite.

The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name &quot;copper sulfate&quot; with the old term &quot;vitriol of Venus.&quot; Lavoisier&#x27;s new nomenclature spread throughout Europe and to the United States and became common use in the field of chemistry. This marked the beginning of the anti-phlogistic approach to the field.

===Chemical revolution and opposition===
Lavoisier is commonly cited as a central contributor to the chemical revolution. His precise measurements and meticulous keeping of balance sheets throughout his experiment were vital to the widespread acceptance of the law of conservation of mass. His introduction of new terminology, a binomial system modeled after that of Linnaeus, also helps to mark the dramatic changes in the field which are referred to generally as the chemical revolution. Lavoisier encountered much opposition in trying to change the field, especially from British phlogistic scientists. Joseph Priestley, Richard Kirwan, James Keir, and William Nicholson, among others, argued that quantification of substances did not imply conservation of mass. Rather than reporting factual evidence, opposition claimed Lavoisier was misinterpreting the implications of his research. One of Lavoisier&#x27;s allies, Jean Baptiste Biot, wrote of Lavoisier&#x27;s methodology, &quot;one felt the necessity of linking accuracy in experiments to rigor of reasoning.&quot; His opposition argued that precision in experimentation did not imply precision in inferences and reasoning. Despite opposition, Lavoisier continued to use precise instrumentation to convince other chemists of his conclusions, often results to five to eight decimal places. Nicholson, who estimated that only three of these decimal places were meaningful, stated: 
==Notable works==
===Easter memoir===
The &quot;official&quot; version of Lavoisier&#x27;s Easter Memoir appeared in 1778. In the intervening period, Lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of Priestley&#x27;s latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestley&#x27;s dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined. He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air. Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but &quot;nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air&quot; or the &quot;eminently respirable part of the air&quot;. The same year he coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air, from the Greek words meaning &quot;acid former&quot;. He was struck by the fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and nitrogen were acidic. He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle.

===Dismantling phlogiston theory===

Lavoisier&#x27;s chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion. In 1783 he read to the academy his paper entitled &quot;Réflexions sur le phlogistique&quot; (Reflections on Phlogiston), a full-scale attack on the current phlogiston theory of combustion. That year Lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of Henry Cavendish&#x27;s inflammable air, now known as hydrogen, with &quot;dephlogisticated air&quot; (air in the process of combustion, now known to be oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted Cavendish&#x27;s production of pure water by burning hydrogen in oxygen, but they interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of phlogiston theory. Lavoisier learned of Cavendish&#x27;s experiment in June 1783 via Charles Blagden (before the results were published in 1784), and immediately recognized water as the oxide of a &quot;hydrogenerative&quot; gas.

In cooperation with Laplace, Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury. The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element, as had been thought for over 2,000 years, but a compound of two gases, hydrogen and oxygen. The interpretation of water as a compound explained the inflammable air generated from dissolving metals in acids (hydrogen produced when water decomposes) and the reduction of calces by inflammable air (a combination of gas from calx with oxygen to form water).

Despite these experiments, Lavoisier&#x27;s antiphlogistic approach remained unaccepted by many other chemists. Lavoisier labored to provide definitive proof of the composition of water, attempting to use this in support of his theory. Working with Jean-Baptiste Meusnier, Lavoisier passed water through a red-hot iron gun barrel, allowing the oxygen to form an oxide with the iron and the hydrogen to emerge from the end of the pipe. He submitted his findings of the composition of water to the Académie des Sciences in April 1784, reporting his figures to eight decimal places. Opposition responded to this further experimentation by stating that Lavoisier continued to draw the incorrect conclusions and that his experiment demonstrated the displacement of phlogiston from iron by the combination of water with the metal. Lavoisier developed a new apparatus which used a pneumatic trough, a set of balances, a thermometer, and a barometer, all calibrated carefully. Thirty savants were invited to witness the decomposition and synthesis of water using this apparatus, convincing many who attended of the correctness of Lavoisier&#x27;s theories. This demonstration established water as a compound of oxygen and hydrogen with great certainty for those who viewed it. The dissemination of the experiment, however, proved subpar, as it lacked the details to properly display the amount of precision taken in the measurements. The paper ended with a hasty statement that the experiment was &quot;more than sufficient to lay hold of the certainty of the proposition&quot; of the composition of water and stated that the methods used in the experiment would unite chemistry with the other physical sciences and advance discoveries.

===&quot;Elementary Treatise of Chemistry&quot;===
Lavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his &quot;Traité élémentaire de chimie&quot; (&quot;Elementary Treatise on Chemistry&quot;), published in 1789. This work represents the synthesis of Lavoisier&#x27;s contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern textbook on the subject. The core of the work was the oxygen theory, and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the law of conservation of mass, and denied the existence of phlogiston. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis and presented Lavoisier&#x27;s theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. It remains a classic in the history of science. While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier&#x27;s new ideas, demand for &quot;Traité élémentaire&quot; as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication. In any event, the &quot;Traité élémentaire&quot; was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.

===Physiological work===
The relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes. Lavoisier was almost obliged, therefore, to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of respiration physiology. His first memoirs on this topic were read to the Academy of Sciences in 1777, but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782–1783 in association with Laplace. The result of this work was published in a memoir, &quot;On Heat.&quot; Lavoisier and Laplace designed an ice calorimeter apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of around an inner shell filled with ice. By measuring the quantity of carbon dioxide and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus, and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled, they concluded that respiration was, in fact, a slow combustion process. Lavoisier stated, &quot;la respiration est donc une combustion,&quot; that is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.

This continuous slow combustion, which they supposed took place in the lungs, enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat. Lavoisier continued these respiration experiments in 1789–1790 in cooperation with Armand Seguin. They designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body metabolism and respiration using Seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments. Their work was only partially completed and published because of the Revolution&#x27;s disruption, but Lavoisier&#x27;s pioneering work in this field inspired similar research on physiological processes for generations.

==Legacy==
Lavoisier&#x27;s fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous).

Lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with Laplace. They used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced, eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction.

Lavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory, believing that radicals, which function as a single group in a chemical process, combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of allotropy in chemical elements when he discovered that diamond is a crystalline form of carbon.

He was also responsible for the construction of the gasometer, an expensive instrument he used at his demonstrations. While he used his gasometer exclusively for these, he also created smaller, cheaper, more practical gasometers that worked with a sufficient degree of precision that more chemists could recreate.

Overall, his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century.

Following his death, a collection comprising most of his scientific manuscripts and instruments was established by his relatives at the Château de la Canière in Puy-de-Dôme.

Mount Lavoisier in New Zealand&#x27;s Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.

==Awards and honours==
During his lifetime, Lavoisier was awarded a gold medal by the King of France for his work on urban street lighting (1766), and was appointed to the French Academy of Sciences (1768). He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1775.

Lavoisier&#x27;s work was recognized as an International Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society, Académie des sciences de L&#x27;institut de France and the Société Chimique de France in 1999. Antoine Laurent Lavoisier&#x27;s Louis 1788 publication entitled &quot;Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique&quot;, published with colleagues Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented at the Académie des Sciences (Paris) in 2015.
A number of Lavoisier Medals have been named and given in Lavoisier&#x27;s honour, by organizations including the Société chimique de France, the International Society for Biological Calorimetry, and the DuPont company He is also commemorated by the Franklin-Lavoisier Prize, marking the friendship of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and Benjamin Franklin. The prize, which includes a medal, is given jointly by the Fondation de la Maison de la Chimie in Paris, France and the Science History Institute in Philadelphia, PA, USA.

<doc id="1825" wikidata="Q76621" url="?curid=1825" title="Hermann Kolbe">
<text>Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe (27 September 1818 – 25 November 1884) was a German chemist and academic, and a major contributor to the birth of modern organic chemistry. He was a professor at Marburg and Leipzig. Kolbe was the first to apply the term synthesis in a chemical context, and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the organic substance acetic acid from carbon disulfide, and also contributed to the development of structural theory. This was done via modifications to the idea of &quot;radicals&quot; and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his Kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts, the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin and the Kolbe nitrile synthesis. After studies with Wöhler and Bunsen, Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through work in London (with Frankland). He was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and won the Royal Society of London&#x27;s Davy Medal in the year of his death. Despite these accomplishments and his training important members of the next generation of chemists (including Zaitsev, Curtius, Beckmann, Graebe, Markovnikov, and others), Kolbe is best remembered for editing the &quot;Journal für Praktische Chemie&quot; for more than a decade, in which his vituperative essays on Kekulé&#x27;s structure of benzene, van&#x27;t Hoff&#x27;s theory on the origin of chirality and Baeyer&#x27;s reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent. Kolbe died of a heart attack in Leipzig at age 66, six years after the death of his wife, Charlotte.

==Life==

Kolbe was born in Elliehausen, near Göttingen, Kingdom of Hanover (Germany) as the eldest son of a Protestant pastor. At the age of 13, he entered the Göttingen Gymnasium, residing at the home of one of the professors. He obtained the leaving certificate (the Abitur) six years later. He had become passionate about the study of chemistry, matriculating at the University of Göttingen in the spring of 1838 in order to study with the famous chemist Friedrich Wöhler.

In 1842, he became an assistant to Robert Bunsen at the Philipps-Universität Marburg. He took his doctoral degree in 1843 at the same university. A new opportunity arose in 1845, when he became assistant to Lyon Playfair at the new &quot;Museum of Economic Geology&quot; in London and a close friend of Edward Frankland. From 1847, he was engaged in editing the &quot;Handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten Chemie&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of Pure and Applied Chemistry&quot;) edited by Justus von Liebig, Wöhler, and Johann Christian Poggendorff, and he also wrote an important textbook. In 1851, Kolbe succeeded Bunsen as professor of chemistry at Marburg and, in 1865, he was called to the Universität Leipzig. In 1864, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1874.

In 1853, he married Charlotte, the daughter of General-Major Wilhelm von Bardeleben. His wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage. They had four children.

==Work in chemical research==

As late as the 1840s, and despite Friedrich Wöhler&#x27;s synthesis of urea in 1828, some chemists still believed in the doctrine of vitalism, according to which a special life-force was necessary to create &quot;organic&quot; (i.e., in its original meaning, biologically derived) compounds. Kolbe promoted the idea that organic compounds could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this &quot;organic&quot; context, directly or indirectly, by substitution processes. (Hence, while by modern definitions, he was converting one organic molecule to another, by the parlance of his era, he was converting &quot;inorganic&quot;—&quot;anorganisch&quot;—substances into &quot;organic&quot; ones only thought accessible through vital processes.) He validated his theory by converting carbon disulfide (CS2) to acetic acid () in several steps (1843–45). Kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural radicals, so contributing to the development of structural theory. A dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules. Kolbe was the first person to use the word synthesis in its present-day meaning, and contributed a number of new chemical reactions.

In particular, Kolbe developed procedures for the electrolysis of the salts of fatty and other carboxylic acids (Kolbe electrolysis) and prepared salicylic acid, a building block of aspirin in a process called Kolbe synthesis or Kolbe-Schmitt reaction. His method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the Kolbe nitrile synthesis, and with Edward Frankland he found that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids.
In addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work, Kolbe oversaw student research at Leipzig and especially at Marburg; students spending time under his tutelage included Peter Griess, Aleksandr Mikhailovich Zaitsev (known for Zaitsev&#x27;s rule predicting the product composition of elimination reactions), Theodor Curtius (discoverer of diazo compounds, hydrazines, and the Curtius rearrangement), Ernst Otto Beckmann (discoverer of the Beckmann rearrangement), Carl Graebe (discoverer of alizarin), Oscar Loew, Constantin Fahlberg, Nikolai Menshutkin, Vladimir Markovnikov (first to describe carbocycles smaller and larger than cyclohexane, and known for Markovnikov&#x27;s rule describing addition reactions to alkenes), Jacob Volhard, Ludwig Mond, Alexander Crum Brown (first to describe the double bond of ethylene), Maxwell Simpson, and Frederick Guthrie.

==Work as journal editor==
Besides his work for periodicals he wrote numerous books
Kolbe served for more than a decade as what, in modern terms, would be understood the senior editor of the &quot;Journal für Praktische Chemie&quot; (&quot;Journal of practical chemistry&quot;, from 1870 to 1884), Kolbe was sometimes so severely critical of the work of others, especially after about 1874, that some wondered whether he might have been suffering a mental illness. He was intolerant of what he regarded as loose speculation parading as theory, and sought through his writings to save his beloved science of chemistry from what he regarded as the scourge of modern structural theory.

His rejection of structural chemistry, especially the theories of the structure of benzene by August Kekulé, the theory of the asymmetric carbon atom by J.H. van&#x27;t Hoff, and the reform of chemical nomenclature by Adolf von Baeyer, was expressed in his vituperative articles in the &quot;Journal für Praktische Chemie&quot;. Some translated quotes illustrate his manner of articulating the deep conflict between his interpretation of chemistry and that of the structural chemists: «&quot;...Baeyer is an excellent experimentor, but he is only an empiricist, lacking sense and capability, and his interpretations of his experiments show particular deficiency in his familiarity with the principles of true science...»&quot;The violence of his language worked to limit his posthumous reputation.
