<text>The Battle of Jutland () was a naval battle between Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy Grand Fleet, under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, and the Imperial German Navy&#x27;s High Seas Fleet, under Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, during World War I. The battle unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and three main engagements from 31 May to 1 June 1916, off the North Sea coast of Denmark&#x27;s Jutland Peninsula. It was the largest naval battle and only full-scale clash of battleships of the war, and the outcome ensured that the Royal Navy denied the German surface fleet access to the North Sea and the Atlantic for the remainder of the war. Germany avoided all fleet-to-fleet contact thereafter. Jutland was also the last major naval battle, in any war, fought primarily by battleships.

Germany&#x27;s High Seas Fleet intended to lure out, trap, and destroy a portion of the British Grand Fleet. The German naval force was insufficient to openly engage the British fleet. This was part of a larger strategy to break the British blockade of Germany and allow German naval vessels access to the Atlantic. Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy pursued a strategy of engaging and destroying the High Seas Fleet, thereby keeping German naval forces contained and away from Britain and her shipping lanes. The Germans planned to use Vice-Admiral Franz Hipper&#x27;s fast scouting group of five modern battlecruisers to lure Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty&#x27;s battlecruiser squadrons into the path of the main German fleet. They stationed submarines across the likely routes of the British ships. However, the British learned from signal intercepts that a major fleet operation was likely, so on 30 May, Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty, passing over the German submarine picket lines while they were unprepared. The German plan had been delayed, causing further problems for their submarines, which had reached the limit of their endurance at sea.

On the afternoon of 31 May, Beatty encountered Hipper&#x27;s battlecruiser force earlier than the Germans had expected. Hipper successfully drew the British vanguard into the path of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Beatty sighted the larger force and turned back towards the British main fleet, he had lost two battlecruisers, from a force of six battlecruisers and four battleships. Beatty&#x27;s withdrawal at the sight of the High Seas Fleet, which the British had not known was in the open sea, reversed the battle by drawing the Germans towards the British Grand Fleet. Between 18:30, when the sun was lowering, back-lighting the German forces, and nightfall at 20:30, the two fleets—totalling 250 ships—directly engaged twice. Fourteen British and eleven German ships sank, with a total of 9,823 casualties. After sunset Jellicoe manoeuvred to cut the Germans off from their base, hoping to continue the battle the next morning, but under the cover of darkness Scheer broke through the British light forces forming the rearguard of the Grand Fleet and returned to port.

Both sides claimed victory. The British lost more ships and over twice as many sailors but succeeded in containing the German fleet. The British press criticised the Grand Fleet&#x27;s failure to force a decisive outcome, while Scheer&#x27;s plan of destroying a substantial portion of the British fleet failed. The British long-term strategy of denying Germany access to the United Kingdom and Atlantic succeeded. The Germans&#x27; &quot;fleet in being&quot; continued to pose a threat, requiring the British to keep their battleships concentrated in the North Sea, but the battle reinforced the German policy of avoiding all fleet-to-fleet contact. At the end of 1916, after further unsuccessful attempts to reduce the Royal Navy&#x27;s numerical advantage, the German Navy accepted its surface ships had been successfully contained, turning its resources to unrestricted submarine warfare for the second time (the first attempt of the war having ended with the controversy following the sinking of the RMS Lusitania by ) and destruction of Allied and neutral shipping, which—with the Zimmermann Telegram—by April 1917 triggered the United States of America&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany. Reviews by the Royal Navy generated disagreement between supporters of Jellicoe and Beatty concerning their performance in battle; debate over this and the significance of the battle continues.
==Background and planning==

===German planning===
With 16 dreadnought-type battleships, compared with the Royal Navy&#x27;s 28, the German High Seas Fleet stood little chance of winning a head-to-head clash. The Germans therefore adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy. They would stage raids into the North Sea and bombard the English coast, with the aim of luring out small British squadrons and pickets, which could then be destroyed by superior forces or submarines.

In January 1916, Admiral von Pohl, commander of the German fleet, fell ill. He was replaced by Scheer, who believed that the fleet had been used too defensively, had better ships and men than the British, and ought to take the war to them. According to Scheer, the German naval strategy should be:

On 25 April 1916, a decision was made by the German Imperial Admiralty to halt indiscriminate attacks by submarines on merchant shipping. This followed protests from neutral countries, notably the United States, that their nationals had been the victims of attacks. Germany agreed that future attacks would only take place in accord with internationally agreed prize rules, which required an attacker to give a warning and allow the crews of vessels time to escape, and not to attack neutral vessels at all. Scheer believed that it would not be possible to continue attacks on these terms, which took away the advantage of secret approach by submarines and left them vulnerable to even relatively small guns on the target ships. Instead, he set about deploying the submarine fleet against military vessels.

It was hoped that, following a successful German submarine attack, fast British escorts, such as destroyers, would be tied down by anti-submarine operations. If the Germans could catch the British in the expected locations, good prospects were thought to exist of at least partially redressing the balance of forces between the fleets. &quot;After the British sortied in response to the raiding attack force&quot;, the Royal Navy&#x27;s centuries-old instincts for aggressive action could be exploited to draw its weakened units towards the main German fleet under Scheer. The hope was that Scheer would thus be able to ambush a section of the British fleet and destroy it.

====Submarine deployments====
A plan was devised to station submarines offshore from British naval bases, and then stage some action that would draw out the British ships to the waiting submarines. The battlecruiser had been damaged in a previous engagement, but was due to be repaired by mid-May, so an operation was scheduled for 17 May 1916. At the start of May, difficulties with condensers were discovered on ships of the third battleship squadron, so the operation was put back to 23 May. Ten submarines—, , , , , , , , , and —were given orders first to patrol in the central North Sea between 17 and 22 May, and then to take up waiting positions. &quot;U-43&quot; and &quot;U-44&quot; were stationed in the Pentland Firth, which the Grand Fleet was likely to cross when leaving Scapa Flow, while the remainder proceeded to the Firth of Forth, awaiting battlecruisers departing Rosyth. Each boat had an allocated area, within which it could move around as necessary to avoid detection, but was instructed to keep within it. During the initial North Sea patrol the boats were instructed to sail only north–south so that any enemy who chanced to encounter one would believe it was departing or returning from operations on the west coast (which required them to pass around the north of Britain). Once at their final positions, the boats were under strict orders to avoid premature detection that might give away the operation. It was arranged that a coded signal would be transmitted to alert the submarines exactly when the operation commenced: &quot;Take into account the enemy&#x27;s forces may be putting to sea&quot;.

Additionally, &quot;UB-27&quot; was sent out on 20 May with instructions to work its way into the Firth of Forth past May Island. &quot;U-46&quot; was ordered to patrol the coast of Sunderland, which had been chosen for the diversionary attack, but because of engine problems it was unable to leave port and &quot;U-47&quot; was diverted to this task. On 13 May, &quot;U-72&quot; was sent to lay mines in the Firth of Forth; on the 23rd, &quot;U-74&quot; departed to lay mines in the Moray Firth; and on the 24th, &quot;U-75&quot; was dispatched similarly west of the Orkney Islands. &quot;UB-21&quot; and &quot;UB-22&quot; were sent to patrol the Humber, where (incorrect) reports had suggested the presence of British warships. &quot;U-22&quot;, &quot;U-46&quot; and &quot;U-67&quot; were positioned north of Terschelling to protect against intervention by British light forces stationed at Harwich.

On 22 May 1916, it was discovered that &quot;Seydlitz&quot; was still not watertight after repairs and would not now be ready until the 29th. The ambush submarines were now on station and experiencing difficulties of their own: visibility near the coast was frequently poor due to fog, and sea conditions were either so calm the slightest ripple, as from the periscope, could give away their position, or so rough as to make it very hard to keep the vessel at a steady depth. The British had become aware of unusual submarine activity, and had begun counter-patrols that forced the submarines out of position. &quot;UB-27&quot; passed Bell Rock on the night of 23 May on its way into the Firth of Forth as planned, but was halted by engine trouble. After repairs it continued to approach, following behind merchant vessels, and reached Largo Bay on 25 May. There the boat became entangled in nets that fouled one of the propellers, forcing it to abandon the operation and return home. &quot;U-74&quot; was detected by four armed trawlers on 27 May and sunk south-east of Peterhead. &quot;U-75&quot; laid its mines off the Orkney Islands, which, although they played no part in the battle, were responsible later for sinking the cruiser carrying Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War on 5 June, killing him and all but 12 of the crew. &quot;U-72&quot; was forced to abandon its mission without laying any mines when an oil leak meant it was leaving a visible surface trail astern.

====Zeppelins====
The Germans maintained a fleet of Zeppelins that they used for aerial reconnaissance and occasional bombing raids. The planned raid on Sunderland intended to use Zeppelins to watch out for the British fleet approaching from the north, which might otherwise surprise the raiders.

By 28 May, strong north-easterly winds meant that it would not be possible to send out the Zeppelins, so the raid again had to be postponed. The submarines could only stay on station until 1 June before their supplies would be exhausted and they had to return, so a decision had to be made quickly about the raid.

It was decided to use an alternative plan, abandoning the attack on Sunderland but instead sending a patrol of battlecruisers to the Skagerrak, where it was likely they would encounter merchant ships carrying British cargo and British cruiser patrols. It was felt this could be done without air support, because the action would now be much closer to Germany, relying instead on cruiser and torpedo boat patrols for reconnaissance.

Orders for the alternative plan were issued on 28 May, although it was still hoped that last-minute improvements in the weather would allow the original plan to go ahead. The German fleet assembled in the Jade River and at Wilhelmshaven and was instructed to raise steam and be ready for action from midnight on 28 May.

By 14:00 on 30 May, the wind was still too strong and the final decision was made to use the alternative plan. The coded signal &quot;31 May G.G.2490&quot; was transmitted to the ships of the fleet to inform them the Skagerrak attack would start on 31 May. The pre-arranged signal to the waiting submarines was transmitted throughout the day from the E-Dienst radio station at Bruges, and the U-boat tender &quot;Arcona&quot; anchored at Emden. Only two of the waiting submarines, &quot;U-66&quot; and &quot;U-32&quot;, received the order.

===British response===
Unfortunately for the German plan, the British had obtained a copy of the main German codebook from the light cruiser , which had been boarded by the Russian Navy after the ship ran aground in Russian territorial waters in 1914. German naval radio communications could therefore often be quickly deciphered, and the British Admiralty usually knew about German activities.

The British Admiralty&#x27;s Room 40 maintained direction finding and interception of German naval signals. It had intercepted and decrypted a German signal on 28 May that provided &quot;ample evidence that the German fleet was stirring in the North Sea&quot;. Further signals were intercepted, and although they were not decrypted it was clear that a major operation was likely. At 11:00 on 30 May, Jellicoe was warned that the German fleet seemed prepared to sail the following morning. By 17:00, the Admiralty had intercepted the signal from Scheer, &quot;31 May G.G.2490&quot;, making it clear something significant was imminent.

Not knowing the Germans&#x27; objective, Jellicoe and his staff decided to position the fleet to head off any attempt by the Germans to enter the North Atlantic or the Baltic through the Skagerrak, by taking up a position off Norway where they could potentially cut off any German raid into the shipping lanes of the Atlantic or prevent the Germans from heading into the Baltic. A position further west was unnecessary, as that area of the North Sea could be patrolled by air.
Consequently, Admiral Jellicoe led the sixteen dreadnought battleships of the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons of the Grand Fleet and three battlecruisers of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron eastwards out of Scapa Flow at 22:30 on 30 May. He was to meet the 2nd Battle Squadron of eight dreadnought battleships commanded by Vice-Admiral Martyn Jerram coming from Cromarty. Beatty&#x27;s force of six ships of the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons plus the 5th Battle Squadron of four fast battleships left the Firth of Forth at around the same time; Jellicoe intended to rendezvous with him west of the mouth of the Skagerrak off the coast of Jutland and wait for the Germans to appear or for their intentions to become clear. The planned position would give him the widest range of responses to likely German moves. Hipper&#x27;s raiding force did not leave the Outer Jade Roads until 01:00 on 31 May, heading west of Heligoland Island following a cleared channel through the minefields, heading north at . The main German fleet of sixteen dreadnought battleships of 1st and 3rd Battle Squadrons left the Jade at 02:30, being joined off Heligoland at 04:00 by the six pre-dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron coming from the Elbe River.

==Naval tactics in 1916==

The principle of concentration of force was fundamental to the fleet tactics of this time. As outlined by Captain Reginald Hall in 1914, tactical doctrine called for a fleet approaching battle to be in a compact formation of parallel columns, allowing relatively easy manoeuvring, and giving shortened sight lines within the formation, which simplified the passing of the signals necessary for command and control.

A fleet formed in several short columns could change its heading faster than one formed in a single long column. Since most command signals were made with flags or signal lamps between ships, the flagship was usually placed at the head of the centre column so that its signals might be more easily seen by the many ships of the formation. Wireless telegraphy was in use, though security (radio direction finding), encryption, and the limitation of the radio sets made their extensive use more problematic. Command and control of such huge fleets remained difficult.

Thus, it might take a very long time for a signal from the flagship to be relayed to the entire formation. It was usually necessary for a signal to be confirmed by each ship before it could be relayed to other ships, and an order for a fleet movement would have to be received and acknowledged by every ship before it could be executed. In a large single-column formation, a signal could take 10 minutes or more to be passed from one end of the line to the other, whereas in a formation of parallel columns, visibility across the diagonals was often better (and always shorter) than in a single long column, and the diagonals gave signal &quot;redundancy&quot;, increasing the probability that a message would be quickly seen and correctly interpreted.

However, before battle was joined the heavy units of the fleet would, if possible, deploy into a single column. To form the battle line in the correct orientation relative to the enemy, the commanding admiral had to know the enemy fleet&#x27;s distance, bearing, heading, and speed. It was the task of the scouting forces, consisting primarily of battlecruisers and cruisers, to find the enemy and report this information in sufficient time, and, if possible, to deny the enemy&#x27;s scouting forces the opportunity of obtaining the equivalent information.

Ideally, the battle line would cross the intended path of the enemy column so that the maximum number of guns could be brought to bear, while the enemy could fire only with the forward guns of the leading ships, a manoeuvre known as &quot;crossing the T&quot;. Admiral Tōgō, commander of the Japanese battleship fleet, had achieved this against Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky&#x27;s Russian battleships in 1905 at the Battle of Tsushima, with devastating results. Jellicoe achieved this twice in one hour against the High Seas Fleet at Jutland, but on both occasions, Scheer managed to turn away and disengage, thereby avoiding a decisive action. 

===Ship design===
Within the existing technological limits, a trade-off had to be made between the weight and size of guns, the weight of armour protecting the ship, and the maximum speed. Battleships sacrificed speed for armour and heavy naval guns ( or larger). British battlecruisers sacrificed weight of armour for greater speed (their purpose being to catch and destroy cruisers while avoiding battleships), while their German counterparts were armed with lighter guns and heavier armour. These weight savings allowed them to escape danger or catch other ships. Generally, the larger guns mounted on British ships allowed an engagement at greater range. In theory, a lightly armoured ship could stay out of range of a slower opponent while still scoring hits. The fast pace of development in the pre-war years meant that every few years, a new generation of ships rendered its predecessors obsolete. Thus, fairly young ships could still be obsolete compared with the newest ships, and fare badly in an engagement against them. Some research has also shown that the chemicals used in British naval ammunition increased the chances of internal explosions. 

Admiral John Fisher, responsible for reconstruction of the British fleet in the pre-war period, favoured large guns, fuel oil, and speed. Admiral Tirpitz, responsible for the German fleet, favoured ship survivability and chose to sacrifice some gun size for improved armour. The German battlecruiser had belt armour equivalent in thickness—though not as comprehensive—to the British battleship , significantly better than on the British battlecruisers such as &quot;Tiger&quot;. German ships had better internal subdivision and had fewer doors and other weak points in their bulkheads, but with the disadvantage that space for crew was greatly reduced. As they were designed only for sorties in the North Sea they did not need to be as habitable as the British vessels and their crews could live in barracks ashore when in harbour.

==Order of battle==

Warships of the period were armed with guns firing projectiles of varying weights, bearing high explosive warheads. The sum total of weight of all the projectiles fired by all the ship&#x27;s broadside guns is referred to as &quot;weight of broadside&quot;. At Jutland, the total of the British ships&#x27; weight of broadside was , while the German fleet&#x27;s total was . This does not take into consideration the ability of some ships and their crews to fire more or less rapidly than others, which would increase or decrease amount of fire that one combatant was able to bring to bear on their opponent for any length of time.

Jellicoe&#x27;s Grand Fleet was split into two sections. The dreadnought Battle Fleet, with which he sailed, formed the main force and was composed of 24 battleships and three battlecruisers. The battleships were formed into three squadrons of eight ships, further subdivided into divisions of four, each led by a flag officer. Accompanying them were eight armoured cruisers (classified by the Royal Navy since 1913 as &quot;cruisers&quot;), eight light cruisers, four scout cruisers, 51 destroyers, and one destroyer-minelayer.
The Grand Fleet sailed without three of its battleships: in refit at Invergordon, dry-docked at Rosyth and in refit at Devonport. The brand new was left behind; with only three weeks in service, her untrained crew was judged unready for battle. had been sunk by a German mine on 27 October 1914.

British reconnaissance was provided by the Battlecruiser Fleet under David Beatty: six battlecruisers, four fast s, 14 light cruisers and 27 destroyers. Air scouting was provided by the attachment of the seaplane tender , one of the first aircraft carriers in history to participate in a naval engagement.

The German High Seas Fleet under Scheer was also split into a main force and a separate reconnaissance force. Scheer&#x27;s main battle fleet was composed of 16 battleships and six pre-dreadnought battleships arranged in an identical manner to the British. With them were six light cruisers and 31 torpedo-boats, (the latter being roughly equivalent to a British destroyer). The only German battleship missing was .
The German scouting force, commanded by Franz Hipper, consisted of five battlecruisers, five light cruisers and 30 torpedo-boats. The Germans had no equivalent to &quot;Engadine&quot; and no heavier-than-air aircraft to operate with the fleet but had the Imperial German Naval Airship Service&#x27;s force of rigid airships available to patrol the North Sea.

All of the battleships and battlecruisers on both sides carried torpedoes of various sizes, as did the lighter craft. The British battleships carried three or four underwater torpedo tubes. The battlecruisers carried from two to five. All were either 18-inch or 21-inch diameter. The German battleships carried five or six underwater torpedo tubes in three sizes from 18 to 21 inch and the battlecruisers carried four or five tubes.

The German battle fleet was hampered by the slow speed and relatively poor armament of the six pre-dreadnoughts of II Squadron, which limited maximum fleet speed to , compared to maximum British fleet speed of . On the British side, the eight armoured cruisers were deficient in both speed and armour protection.

==Battlecruiser action==
The route of the British battlecruiser fleet took it through the patrol sector allocated to &quot;U-32&quot;. After receiving the order to commence the operation, the U-boat moved to a position east of the Isle of May at dawn on 31 May. At 03:40, it sighted the cruisers and leaving the Forth at . It launched one torpedo at the leading cruiser at a range of , but its periscope jammed &#x27;up&#x27;, giving away the position of the submarine as it manoeuvred to fire a second. The lead cruiser turned away to dodge the torpedo, while the second turned towards the submarine, attempting to ram. &quot;U-32&quot; crash dived, and on raising its periscope at 04:10 saw two battlecruisers (the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron) heading south-east. They were too far away to attack, but &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; von Spiegel reported the sighting of two battleships and two cruisers to Germany.

&quot;U-66&quot; was also supposed to be patrolling off the Firth of Forth but had been forced north to a position off Peterhead by patrolling British vessels. This now brought it into contact with the 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from the Moray Firth. At 05:00, it had to crash dive when the cruiser appeared from the mist heading toward it. It was followed by another cruiser, , and eight battleships. &quot;U-66&quot; got within of the battleships preparing to fire, but was forced to dive by an approaching destroyer and missed the opportunity. At 06:35, it reported eight battleships and cruisers heading north.

The courses reported by both submarines were incorrect, because they reflected one leg of a zigzag being used by British ships to avoid submarines. Taken with a wireless intercept of more ships leaving Scapa Flow earlier in the night, they created the impression in the German High Command that the British fleet, whatever it was doing, was split into separate sections moving apart, which was precisely as the Germans wished to meet it.

Jellicoe&#x27;s ships proceeded to their rendezvous undamaged and undiscovered. However, he was now misled by an Admiralty intelligence report advising that the German main battle fleet was still in port. The Director of Operations Division, Rear Admiral Thomas Jackson, had asked the intelligence division, Room 40, for the current location of German call sign DK, used by Admiral Scheer. They had replied that it was currently transmitting from Wilhelmshaven. It was known to the intelligence staff that Scheer deliberately used a different call sign when at sea, but no one asked for this information or explained the reason behind the query—to locate the German fleet.

The German battlecruisers cleared the minefields surrounding the Amrum swept channel by 09:00. They then proceeded north-west, passing west of the Horn&#x27;s Reef lightship heading for the Little Fisher Bank at the mouth of the Skagerrak. The High Seas Fleet followed some behind. The battlecruisers were in line ahead, with the four cruisers of the II scouting group plus supporting torpedo boats ranged in an arc ahead and to either side. The IX torpedo boat flotilla formed close support immediately surrounding the battlecruisers. The High Seas Fleet similarly adopted a line-ahead formation, with close screening by torpedo boats to either side and a further screen of five cruisers surrounding the column away. The wind had finally moderated so that Zeppelins could be used, and by 11:30 five had been sent out: &quot;L14&quot; to the Skagerrak, &quot;L23&quot; east of Noss Head in the Pentland Firth, &quot;L21&quot; off Peterhead, &quot;L9&quot; off Sunderland, and &quot;L16&quot; east of Flamborough Head. Visibility, however, was still bad, with clouds down to .

===Contact===

By around 14:00, Beatty&#x27;s ships were proceeding eastward at roughly the same latitude as Hipper&#x27;s squadron, which was heading north. Had the courses remained unchanged, Beatty would have passed between the two German fleets, south of the battlecruisers and north of the High Seas Fleet at around 16:30, possibly trapping his ships just as the German plan envisioned. His orders were to stop his scouting patrol when he reached a point east of Britain and then turn north to meet Jellicoe, which he did at this time. Beatty&#x27;s ships were divided into three columns, with the two battlecruiser squadrons leading in parallel lines apart. The 5th Battle Squadron was stationed to the north-west, on the side furthest away from any expected enemy contact, while a screen of cruisers and destroyers was spread south-east of the battlecruisers. After the turn, the 5th Battle Squadron was now leading the British ships in the westernmost column, and Beatty&#x27;s squadron was centre and rearmost, with the 2nd BCS to the west.

At 14:20 on 31 May, despite heavy haze and scuds of fog giving poor visibility, scouts from Beatty&#x27;s force reported enemy ships to the south-east; the British light units, investigating a neutral Danish steamer (&quot;N J Fjord&quot;), which was stopped between the two fleets, had found two German destroyers engaged on the same mission ( and ). The first shots of the battle were fired at 14:28 when &quot;Galatea&quot; and &quot;Phaeton&quot; of the British 1st Light Cruiser Squadron opened on the German torpedo boats, which withdrew toward their approaching light cruisers. At 14:36, the Germans scored the first hit of the battle when , of Rear-Admiral Friedrich Boedicker&#x27;s Scouting Group II, hit her British counterpart &quot;Galatea&quot; at extreme range.

Beatty began to move his battlecruisers and supporting forces south-eastwards and then east to cut the German ships off from their base and ordered &quot;Engadine&quot; to launch a seaplane to try to get more information about the size and location of the German forces. This was the first time in history that a carrier-based aeroplane was used for reconnaissance in naval combat. &quot;Engadine&quot;″s aircraft did locate and report some German light cruisers just before 15:30 and came under anti-aircraft gunfire but attempts to relay reports from the aeroplane failed.

Unfortunately for Beatty, his initial course changes at 14:32 were not received by Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas&#x27;s 5th Battle Squadron (the distance being too great to read his flags), because the battlecruiser —the last ship in his column—was no longer in a position where she could relay signals by searchlight to Evan-Thomas, as she had previously been ordered to do. Whereas before the north turn, &quot;Tiger&quot; had been the closest ship to Evan-Thomas, she was now further away than Beatty in &quot;Lion&quot;. Matters were aggravated because Evan-Thomas had not been briefed regarding standing orders within Beatty&#x27;s squadron, as his squadron normally operated with the Grand Fleet. Fleet ships were expected to obey movement orders precisely and not deviate from them. Beatty&#x27;s standing instructions expected his officers to use their initiative and keep station with the flagship. As a result, the four &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleships—which were the fastest and most heavily armed in the world at that time—remained on the previous course for several minutes, ending up behind rather than five. Beatty also had the opportunity during the previous hours to concentrate his forces, and no reason not to do so, whereas he steamed ahead at full speed, faster than the battleships could manage. Dividing the force had serious consequences for the British, costing them what would have been an overwhelming advantage in ships and firepower during the first half-hour of the coming battle.

With visibility favouring the Germans, Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers at 15:22, steaming approximately north-west, sighted Beatty&#x27;s squadron at a range of about , while Beatty&#x27;s forces did not identify Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers until 15:30 (position 1 on map). At 15:45, Hipper turned south-east to lead Beatty toward Scheer, who was south-east with the main force of the High Seas Fleet.

===Run to the south===
Beatty&#x27;s conduct during the next 15 minutes has received a great deal of criticism, as his ships out-ranged and outnumbered the German squadron, yet he held his fire for over 10 minutes with the German ships in range. He also failed to use the time available to rearrange his battlecruisers into a fighting formation, with the result that they were still manoeuvring when the battle started.

At 15:48, with the opposing forces roughly parallel at , with the British to the south-west of the Germans (i.e., on the right side), Hipper opened fire, followed by the British ships as their guns came to bear upon targets (position 2). Thus began the opening phase of the battlecruiser action, known as the &quot;Run to the South&quot;, in which the British chased the Germans, and Hipper intentionally led Beatty toward Scheer. During the first minutes of the ensuing battle, all the British ships except &quot;Princess Royal&quot; fired far over their German opponents, due to adverse visibility conditions, before finally getting the range. Only &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; had settled into formation, so the other four ships were hampered in aiming by their own turning. Beatty was to windward of Hipper, and therefore funnel and gun smoke from his own ships tended to obscure his targets, while Hipper&#x27;s smoke blew clear. Also, the eastern sky was overcast and the grey German ships were indistinct and difficult to range.


Beatty had ordered his ships to engage in a line, one British ship engaging with one German and his flagship doubling on the German flagship . However, due to another mistake with signalling by flag, and possibly because &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot; were unable to see the German lead ship because of smoke, the second German ship, &quot;Derfflinger&quot;, was left un-engaged and free to fire without disruption. drew fire from two of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but still fired with great accuracy during this time, hitting &quot;Tiger&quot; 9 times in the first 12 minutes. The Germans drew first blood. Aided by superior visibility, Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers quickly registered hits on three of the six British battlecruisers. Seven minutes passed before the British managed to score their first hit.

The first near-kill of the Run to the South occurred at 16:00, when a shell from &quot;Lützow&quot; wrecked the &quot;Q&quot; turret amidships on Beatty&#x27;s flagship &quot;Lion&quot;. Dozens of crewmen were instantly killed, but far larger destruction was averted when the mortally wounded turret commander—Major Francis Harvey of the Royal Marines—promptly ordered the magazine doors shut and the magazine flooded. This prevented a magazine explosion at 16:28, when a flash fire ignited ready cordite charges beneath the turret and killed everyone in the chambers outside &quot;Q&quot; magazine. &quot;Lion&quot; was saved. was not so lucky; at 16:02, just 14 minutes into the gunnery exchange, she was hit aft by three shells from , causing damage sufficient to knock her out of line and detonating &quot;X&quot; magazine aft. Soon after, despite the near-maximum range, &quot;Von der Tann&quot; put another shell on &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s &quot;A&quot; turret forward. The plunging shells probably pierced the thin upper armour, and seconds later &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was ripped apart by another magazine explosion, sinking immediately and leaving only two survivors from her crew of 1,019 officers and men. (position 3).

Hipper&#x27;s position deteriorated somewhat by 16:15 as the 5th Battle Squadron finally came into range, so that he had to contend with gunfire from the four battleships astern as well as Beatty&#x27;s five remaining battlecruisers to starboard. But he knew his baiting mission was close to completion, as his force was rapidly closing with Scheer&#x27;s main body. At 16:08, the lead battleship of the 5th Battle Squadron, , caught up with Hipper and opened fire at extreme range, scoring a hit on &quot;Von der Tann&quot; within 60 seconds. Still, it was 16:15 before all the battleships of the 5th were able to fully engage at long range.

At 16:25, the battlecruiser action intensified again when was hit by what may have been a combined salvo from &quot;Derfflinger&quot; and &quot;Seydlitz&quot;; she disintegrated when both forward magazines exploded, sinking with all but nine of her 1,275 man crew lost. (position 4). Commander von Hase, the first gunnery officer aboard &quot;Derfflinger&quot;, noted:

During the Run to the South, from 15:48 to 16:54, the German battlecruisers made an estimated total of forty-two hits on the British battlecruisers (nine on &quot;Lion&quot;, six on &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, seven on &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, 14 on &quot;Tiger&quot;, one on &quot;New Zealand&quot;, five on &quot;Indefatigable&quot;), and two more on the battleship &quot;Barham&quot;, compared with only eleven hits by the British battlecruisers (four on &quot;Lützow&quot;, four on &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, two on &quot;Moltke&quot;, one on &quot;von der Tann&quot;), and six hits by the battleships (one on &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, four on &quot;Moltke&quot;, one on &quot;von der Tann&quot;).

Shortly after 16:26, a salvo struck on or around , which was obscured by spray and smoke from shell bursts. A signalman promptly leapt on to the bridge of &quot;Lion&quot; and announced &quot;&quot;Princess Royal&quot;″s blown up, Sir.&quot; Beatty famously turned to his flag captain, saying &quot;Chatfield, there seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today.&quot; (In popular legend, Beatty also immediately ordered his ships to &quot;turn two points to port&quot;, i.e., two points nearer the enemy, but there is no official record of any such command or course change.) &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, as it turned out, was still afloat after the spray cleared.

At 16:30, Scheer&#x27;s leading battleships sighted the distant battlecruiser action; soon after, of Beatty&#x27;s 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron led by Commodore William Goodenough sighted the main body of Scheer&#x27;s High Seas Fleet, dodging numerous heavy-calibre salvos to report in detail the German strength: 16 dreadnoughts with six older battleships. This was the first news that Beatty and Jellicoe had that Scheer and his battle fleet were even at sea. Simultaneously, an all-out destroyer action raged in the space between the opposing battlecruiser forces, as British and German destroyers fought with each other and attempted to torpedo the larger enemy ships. Each side fired many torpedoes, but both battlecruiser forces turned away from the attacks and all escaped harm except &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, which was hit forward at 16:57 by a torpedo fired by the British destroyer . Though taking on water, &quot;Seydlitz&quot; maintained speed. The destroyer , under the command of Captain Barry Bingham, led the British attacks. The British disabled the German torpedo boat , which the Germans soon abandoned and sank, and &quot;Petard&quot; then torpedoed and sank , her second score of the day. and rescued the crews of their sunken sister ships. But &quot;Nestor&quot; and another British destroyer——were immobilised by shell hits, and were later sunk by Scheer&#x27;s passing dreadnoughts. Bingham was rescued, and awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership in the destroyer action.

===Run to the north===
As soon as he himself sighted the vanguard of Scheer&#x27;s distant battleship line away, at 16:40, Beatty turned his battlecruiser force 180°, heading north to draw the Germans toward Jellicoe. (position 5). Beatty&#x27;s withdrawal toward Jellicoe is called the &quot;Run to the North&quot;, in which the tables turned and the Germans chased the British. Because Beatty once again failed to signal his intentions adequately, the battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron—which were too far behind to read his flags—found themselves passing the battlecruisers on an opposing course and heading directly toward the approaching main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 16:48, at extreme range, Scheer&#x27;s leading battleships opened fire.

Meanwhile, at 16:47, having received Goodenough&#x27;s signal and knowing that Beatty was now leading the German battle fleet north to him, Jellicoe signalled to his own forces that the fleet action they had waited so long for was finally imminent; at 16:51, by radio, he informed the Admiralty so in London.

The difficulties of the 5th Battle Squadron were compounded when Beatty gave the order to Evan-Thomas to &quot;turn in succession&quot; (rather than &quot;turn together&quot;) at 16:48 as the battleships passed him. Evan-Thomas acknowledged the signal, but Lieutenant-Commander Ralph Seymour, Beatty&#x27;s flag lieutenant, aggravated the situation when he did not haul down the flags (to execute the signal) for some minutes. At 16:55, when the 5BS had moved within range of the enemy battleships, Evan-Thomas issued his own flag command warning his squadron to expect sudden manoeuvres and to follow his lead, before starting to turn on his own initiative. The order to turn in succession would have resulted in all four ships turning in the same patch of sea as they reached it one by one, giving the High Seas Fleet repeated opportunity with ample time to find the proper range. However, the captain of the trailing ship () turned early, mitigating the adverse results.

For the next hour, the 5th Battle Squadron acted as Beatty&#x27;s rearguard, drawing fire from all the German ships within range, while by 17:10 Beatty had deliberately eased his own squadron out of range of Hipper&#x27;s now-superior battlecruiser force. Since visibility and firepower now favoured the Germans, there was no incentive for Beatty to risk further battlecruiser losses when his own gunnery could not be effective. Illustrating the imbalance, Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers did not score any hits on the Germans in this phase until 17:45, but they had rapidly received five more before he opened the range (four on &quot;Lion&quot;, of which three were by &quot;Lützow&quot;, and one on &quot;Tiger&quot; by &quot;Seydlitz&quot;). Now the only targets the Germans could reach, the ships of the 5th Battle Squadron, received simultaneous fire from Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to the east (which HMS &quot;Barham&quot; and engaged) and Scheer&#x27;s leading battleships to the south-east (which and &quot;Malaya&quot; engaged). Three took hits: &quot;Barham&quot; (four by &quot;Derfflinger&quot;), &quot;Warspite&quot; (two by &quot;Seydlitz&quot;), and &quot;Malaya&quot; (seven by the German battleships). Only &quot;Valiant&quot; was unscathed.

The four battleships were far better suited to take this sort of pounding than the battlecruisers, and none were lost, though &quot;Malaya&quot; suffered heavy damage, an ammunition fire, and heavy crew casualties. At the same time, the fire of the four British ships was accurate and effective. As the two British squadrons headed north at top speed, eagerly chased by the entire German fleet, the 5th Battle Squadron scored 13 hits on the enemy battlecruisers (four on &quot;Lützow&quot;, three on &quot;Derfflinger&quot;, six on &quot;Seydlitz&quot;) and five on battleships (although only one, on , did any serious damage). (position 6).

===The fleets converge===
Jellicoe was now aware that full fleet engagement was nearing, but had insufficient information on the position and course of the Germans. To assist Beatty, early in the battle at about 16:05, Jellicoe had ordered Rear-Admiral Horace Hood&#x27;s 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron to speed ahead to find and support Beatty&#x27;s force, and Hood was now racing SSE well in advance of Jellicoe&#x27;s northern force. Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot&#x27;s 1st Cruiser Squadron patrolled the van of Jellicoe&#x27;s main battleship force as it advanced steadily to the south-east.

At 17:33, the armoured cruiser of Arbuthnot&#x27;s squadron, on the far southwest flank of Jellicoe&#x27;s force, came within view of , which was about ahead of Beatty with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, establishing the first visual link between the converging bodies of the Grand Fleet. At 17:38, the scout cruiser , screening Hood&#x27;s oncoming battlecruisers, was intercepted by the van of the German scouting forces under Rear-Admiral Boedicker.

Heavily outnumbered by Boedicker&#x27;s four light cruisers, &quot;Chester&quot; was pounded before being relieved by Hood&#x27;s heavy units, which swung westward for that purpose. Hood&#x27;s flagship disabled the light cruiser shortly after 17:56. &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; became a sitting target for most of the British fleet during the next hour, but remained afloat and fired some torpedoes at the passing enemy battleships from long range. Meanwhile, Boedicker&#x27;s other ships turned toward Hipper and Scheer in the mistaken belief that Hood was leading a larger force of British capital ships from the north and east. A chaotic destroyer action in mist and smoke ensued as German torpedo boats attempted to blunt the arrival of this new formation, but Hood&#x27;s battlecruisers dodged all the torpedoes fired at them. In this action, after leading a torpedo counter-attack, the British destroyer was disabled, but continued to return fire at numerous passing enemy ships for the next hour.

==Fleet action==

===Deployment===
In the meantime, Beatty and Evan-Thomas had resumed their engagement with Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers, this time with the visual conditions to their advantage. With several of his ships damaged, Hipper turned back toward Scheer at around 18:00, just as Beatty&#x27;s flagship &quot;Lion&quot; was finally sighted from Jellicoe&#x27;s flagship &quot;Iron Duke&quot;. Jellicoe twice demanded the latest position of the German battlefleet from Beatty, who could not see the German battleships and failed to respond to the question until 18:14. Meanwhile, Jellicoe received confused sighting reports of varying accuracy and limited usefulness from light cruisers and battleships on the starboard (southern) flank of his force.

Jellicoe was in a worrying position. He needed to know the location of the German fleet to judge when and how to deploy his battleships from their cruising formation (six columns of four ships each) into a single battle line. The deployment could be on either the westernmost or the easternmost column, and had to be carried out before the Germans arrived; but early deployment could mean losing any chance of a decisive encounter. Deploying to the west would bring his fleet closer to Scheer, gaining valuable time as dusk approached, but the Germans might arrive before the manoeuvre was complete. Deploying to the east would take the force away from Scheer, but Jellicoe&#x27;s ships might be able to cross the &quot;T&quot;, and visibility would strongly favour British gunnery—Scheer&#x27;s forces would be silhouetted against the setting sun to the west, while the Grand Fleet would be indistinct against the dark skies to the north and east, and would be hidden by reflection of the low sunlight off intervening haze and smoke. Deployment would take twenty irreplaceable minutes, and the fleets were closing at full speed. In one of the most critical and difficult tactical command decisions of the entire war, Jellicoe ordered deployment to the east at 18:15.

===Windy Corner===
Meanwhile, Hipper had rejoined Scheer, and the combined High Seas Fleet was heading north, directly toward Jellicoe. Scheer had no indication that Jellicoe was at sea, let alone that he was bearing down from the north-west, and was distracted by the intervention of Hood&#x27;s ships to his north and east. Beatty&#x27;s four surviving battlecruisers were now crossing the van of the British dreadnoughts to join Hood&#x27;s three battlecruisers; at this time, Arbuthnot&#x27;s flagship, the armoured cruiser , and her squadron-mate both charged across Beatty&#x27;s bows, and &quot;Lion&quot; narrowly avoided a collision with &quot;Warrior&quot;. Nearby, numerous British light cruisers and destroyers on the south-western flank of the deploying battleships were also crossing each other&#x27;s courses in attempts to reach their proper stations, often barely escaping collisions, and under fire from some of the approaching German ships. This period of peril and heavy traffic attending the merger and deployment of the British forces later became known as &quot;Windy Corner&quot;.

Arbuthnot was attracted by the drifting hull of the crippled &quot;Wiesbaden&quot;. With &quot;Warrior&quot;, &quot;Defence&quot; closed in for the kill, only to blunder right into the gun sights of Hipper&#x27;s and Scheer&#x27;s oncoming capital ships. &quot;Defence&quot; was deluged by heavy-calibre gunfire from many German battleships, which detonated her magazines in a spectacular explosion viewed by most of the deploying Grand Fleet. She sank with all hands (903 officers and men). &quot;Warrior&quot; was also hit badly, but was spared destruction by a mishap to the nearby battleship &quot;Warspite&quot;. &quot;Warspite&quot; had her steering gear overheat and jam under heavy load at high speed as the 5th Battle Squadron made a turn to the north at 18:19. Steaming at top speed in wide circles, &quot;Warspite&quot; attracted the attention of German dreadnoughts and took 13 hits, inadvertently drawing fire away from the hapless &quot;Warrior&quot;. &quot;Warspite&quot; was brought back under control and survived the onslaught, but was badly damaged, had to reduce speed, and withdrew northward; later (at 21:07), she was ordered back to port by Evan-Thomas. &quot;Warspite&quot; went on to a long and illustrious career, serving also in World War II. &quot;Warrior&quot;, on the other hand, was abandoned and sank the next day after her crew was taken off at 08:25 on 1 June by &quot;Engadine&quot;, which towed the sinking armoured cruiser during the night.
As &quot;Defence&quot; sank and &quot;Warspite&quot; circled, at about 18:19, Hipper moved within range of Hood&#x27;s 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron, but was still also within range of Beatty&#x27;s ships. At first, visibility favoured the British: hit &quot;Derfflinger&quot; three times and &quot;Seydlitz&quot; once, while &quot;Lützow&quot; quickly took 10 hits from &quot;Lion&quot;, and &quot;Invincible&quot;, including two below-waterline hits forward by &quot;Invincible&quot; that would ultimately doom Hipper&#x27;s flagship. But at 18:30, &quot;Invincible&quot; abruptly appeared as a clear target before &quot;Lützow&quot; and &quot;Derfflinger&quot;. The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at &quot;Invincible&quot;, and sank her in 90 seconds. A shell from the third salvo struck &quot;Invincible&quot;″s Q-turret amidships, detonating the magazines below and causing her to blow up and sink. All but six of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Rear-Admiral Hood, were killed. Of the remaining British battlecruisers, only &quot;Princess Royal&quot; received heavy-calibre hits at this time (two by the battleship &quot;Markgraf&quot;). &quot;Lützow&quot;, flooding forward and unable to communicate by radio, was now out of action and began to attempt to withdraw; therefore Hipper left his flagship and transferred to the torpedo boat , hoping to board one of the other battlecruisers later.

===Crossing the T===
By 18:30, the main battle fleet action was joined for the first time, with Jellicoe effectively &quot;crossing Scheer&#x27;s T&quot;. The officers on the lead German battleships, and Scheer himself, were taken completely by surprise when they emerged from drifting clouds of smoky mist to suddenly find themselves facing the massed firepower of the entire Grand Fleet main battle line, which they did not know was even at sea. Jellicoe&#x27;s flagship &quot;Iron Duke&quot; quickly scored seven hits on the lead German dreadnought, , but in this brief exchange, which lasted only minutes, as few as 10 of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s 24 dreadnoughts actually opened fire. The Germans were hampered by poor visibility, in addition to being in an unfavourable tactical position, just as Jellicoe had intended. Realising he was heading into a death trap, Scheer ordered his fleet to turn and disengage at 18:33. Under a pall of smoke and mist, Scheer&#x27;s forces succeeded in disengaging by an expertly executed 180° turn in unison (&quot;battle about turn to starboard&quot;, German &quot;Gefechtskehrtwendung nach Steuerbord&quot;), which was a well-practised emergency manoeuvre of the High Seas Fleet. Scheer declared:

Conscious of the risks to his capital ships posed by torpedoes, Jellicoe did not chase directly but headed south, determined to keep the High Seas Fleet west of him. Starting at 18:40, battleships at the rear of Jellicoe&#x27;s line were in fact sighting and avoiding torpedoes, and at 18:54 was hit by a torpedo (probably from the disabled &quot;Wiesbaden&quot;), which reduced her speed to . Meanwhile, Scheer, knowing that it was not yet dark enough to escape and that his fleet would suffer terribly in a stern chase, doubled back to the east at 18:55. In his memoirs he wrote, &quot;the manoeuvre would be bound to surprise the enemy, to upset his plans for the rest of the day, and if the blow fell heavily it would facilitate the breaking loose at night.&quot; But the turn to the east took his ships, again, directly towards Jellicoe&#x27;s fully deployed battle line.

Simultaneously, the disabled British destroyer HMS &quot;Shark&quot; fought desperately against a group of four German torpedo boats and disabled with gunfire, but was eventually torpedoed and sunk at 19:02 by the German destroyer . &quot;Shark&quot;″s Captain Loftus Jones was awarded the Victoria Cross for his heroism in continuing to fight against all odds.

===Death Ride===

Commodore Goodenough&#x27;s 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron dodged the fire of German battleships for a second time to re-establish contact with the High Seas Fleet shortly after 19:00. By 19:15, Jellicoe had crossed Scheer&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; again. This time his arc of fire was tighter and deadlier, causing severe damage to the German battleships, particularly Rear-Admiral Behncke&#x27;s leading 3rd Squadron (SMS &quot;König&quot;, , &quot;Markgraf&quot;, and all being hit, along with of the 1st Squadron), while on the British side, only the battleship was hit (twice, by &quot;Seydlitz&quot; but with little damage done).

At 19:17, for the second time in less than an hour, Scheer turned his outnumbered and out-gunned fleet to the west using the &quot;battle about turn&quot; (German: &quot;Gefechtskehrtwendung&quot;), but this time it was executed only with difficulty, as the High Seas Fleet&#x27;s lead squadrons began to lose formation under concentrated gunfire. To deter a British chase, Scheer ordered a major torpedo attack by his destroyers and a potentially sacrificial charge by Scouting Group I&#x27;s four remaining battlecruisers. Hipper was still aboard the torpedo boat &quot;G39&quot; and was unable to command his squadron for this attack. Therefore, &quot;Derfflinger&quot;, under Captain Hartog, led the already badly damaged German battlecruisers directly into &quot;the greatest concentration of naval gunfire any fleet commander had ever faced&quot;, at ranges down to .

In what became known as the &quot;death ride&quot;, all the battlecruisers except &quot;Moltke&quot; were hit and further damaged, as 18 of the British battleships fired at them simultaneously. &quot;Derfflinger&quot; had two main gun turrets destroyed. The crews of Scouting Group I suffered heavy casualties, but survived the pounding and veered away with the other battlecruisers once Scheer was out of trouble and the German destroyers were moving in to attack. In this brief but intense portion of the engagement, from about 19:05 to about 19:30, the Germans sustained a total of 37 heavy hits while inflicting only two; &quot;Derfflinger&quot; alone received 14.

While his battlecruisers drew the fire of the British fleet, Scheer slipped away, laying smoke screens. Meanwhile, from about 19:16 to about 19:40, the British battleships were also engaging Scheer&#x27;s torpedo boats, which executed several waves of torpedo attacks to cover his withdrawal. Jellicoe&#x27;s ships turned away from the attacks and successfully evaded all 31 of the torpedoes launched at them—though, in several cases, only barely—and sank the German destroyer &quot;S35&quot;, attributed to a salvo from &quot;Iron Duke&quot;. British light forces also sank &quot;V48&quot;, which had previously been disabled by HMS &quot;Shark&quot;. This action, and the turn away, cost the British critical time and range in the last hour of daylight—as Scheer intended, allowing him to get his heavy ships out of immediate danger.

The last major exchanges between capital ships in this battle—and in the war—took place just after sunset, from about 20:19 to about 20:35, as the surviving British battlecruisers caught up with their German counterparts, which were briefly relieved by Rear-Admiral Mauve&#x27;s obsolete pre-dreadnoughts (the German 2nd Squadron). The British received one heavy hit on &quot;Princess Royal&quot; but scored five more on &quot;Seydlitz&quot; and three on other German ships.

==Night action and German withdrawal==
At 21:00, Jellicoe, conscious of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s deficiencies in night fighting, decided to try to avoid a major engagement until early dawn. He placed a screen of cruisers and destroyers behind his battle fleet to patrol the rear as he headed south to guard Scheer&#x27;s expected escape route. In reality, Scheer opted to cross Jellicoe&#x27;s wake and escape via Horns Reef. Luckily for Scheer, most of the light forces in Jellicoe&#x27;s rearguard failed to report the seven separate encounters with the German fleet during the night; the very few radio reports that were sent to the British flagship were never received, possibly because the Germans were jamming British frequencies. Many of the destroyers failed to make the most of their opportunities to attack discovered ships, despite Jellicoe&#x27;s expectations that the destroyer forces would, if necessary, be able to block the path of the German fleet.

Jellicoe and his commanders did not understand that the furious gunfire and explosions to the north (seen and heard for hours by all the British battleships) indicated that the German heavy ships were breaking through the screen astern of the British fleet. Instead, it was believed that the fighting was the result of night attacks by German destroyers. The most powerful British ships of all (the 15-inch-guns of the 5th Battle Squadron) directly observed German battleships crossing astern of them in action with British light forces, at ranges of or less, and gunners on HMS &quot;Malaya&quot; made ready to fire, but her captain declined, deferring to the authority of Rear-Admiral Evan-Thomas—and neither commander reported the sightings to Jellicoe, assuming that he could see for himself and that revealing the fleet&#x27;s position by radio signals or gunfire was unwise.

While the nature of Scheer&#x27;s escape, and Jellicoe&#x27;s inaction, indicate the overall German superiority in night fighting, the results of the night action were no more clear-cut than were those of the battle as a whole. In the first of many surprise encounters by darkened ships at point-blank range, &quot;Southampton&quot;, Commodore Goodenough&#x27;s flagship, which had scouted so proficiently, was heavily damaged in action with a German Scouting Group composed of light cruisers, but managed to torpedo , which went down at 22:23 with all but 9 hands (320 officers and men).
From 23:20 to approximately 02:15, several British destroyer flotillas launched torpedo attacks on the German battle fleet in a series of violent and chaotic engagements at extremely short range (often under ). At the cost of five destroyers sunk and some others damaged, they managed to torpedo the light cruiser , which sank several hours later, and the pre-dreadnought , which blew up and sank with all hands (839 officers and men) at 03:10 during the last wave of attacks before dawn. Three of the British destroyers collided in the chaos, and the German battleship rammed the British destroyer , blowing away most of the British ship&#x27;s superstructure merely with the muzzle blast of its big guns, which could not be aimed low enough to hit the ship. &quot;Nassau&quot; was left with an hole in her side, reducing her maximum speed to , while the removed plating was left lying on &quot;Spitfire&quot;″s deck. &quot;Spitfire&quot; survived and made it back to port. Another German cruiser, &quot;Elbing&quot;, was accidentally rammed by the dreadnought and abandoned, sinking early the next day. Of the British destroyers, , , , and were lost during the night fighting.

Just after midnight on 1 June, and other German battleships sank &quot;Black Prince&quot; of the ill-fated 1st Cruiser Squadron, which had blundered into the German battle line. Deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the Grand Fleet, &quot;Black Prince&quot; had lost contact in the darkness and took a position near what she thought was the British line. The Germans soon identified the new addition to their line and opened fire. Overwhelmed by point-blank gunfire, &quot;Black Prince&quot; blew up (all 857 officers and men were lost), as her squadron leader &quot;Defence&quot; had done hours earlier. Lost in the darkness, the battlecruisers &quot;Moltke&quot; and &quot;Seydlitz&quot; had similar point-blank encounters with the British battle line and were recognised, but were spared the fate of &quot;Black Prince&quot; when the captains of the British ships, again, declined to open fire, reluctant to reveal their fleet&#x27;s position.

At 01:45, the sinking battlecruiser &quot;Lützow&quot; – fatally damaged by &quot;Invincible&quot; during the main action – was torpedoed by the destroyer on orders of &quot;Lützow&quot;″s Captain Viktor von Harder after the surviving crew of 1,150 transferred to destroyers that came alongside. At 02:15, the German torpedo boat suddenly had its bow blown off; &quot;V2&quot; and &quot;V6&quot; came alongside and took off the remaining crew, and the &quot;V2&quot; then sank the hulk. Since there was no enemy nearby, it was assumed that she had hit a mine or had been torpedoed by a submarine.

At 02:15, five British ships of the 13th Destroyer Flotilla under Captain James Uchtred Farie regrouped and headed south. At 02:25, they sighted the rear of the German line. inquired of the leader as to whether he thought they were British or German ships. Answering that he thought they were German, Farie then veered off to the east and away from the German line. All but &quot;Moresby&quot; in the rear followed, as through the gloom she sighted what she thought were four pre-dreadnought battleships away. She hoisted a flag signal indicating that the enemy was to the west and then closed to firing range, letting off a torpedo set for high running at 02:37, then veering off to rejoin her flotilla. The four pre-dreadnought battleships were in fact two pre-dreadnoughts, &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; and , and the battlecruisers &quot;Von der Tann&quot; and &quot;Derfflinger&quot;. &quot;Von der Tann&quot; sighted the torpedo and was forced to steer sharply to starboard to avoid it as it passed close to her bows. &quot;Moresby&quot; rejoined &quot;Champion&quot; convinced she had scored a hit.

Finally, at 05:20, as Scheer&#x27;s fleet was safely on its way home, the battleship struck a British mine on her starboard side, killing one man and wounding ten, but was able to make port. &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, critically damaged and very nearly sinking, barely survived the return voyage: after grounding and taking on even more water on the evening of 1 June, she had to be assisted stern first into port, where she dropped anchor at 07:30 on the morning of 2 June.

The Germans were helped in their escape by the failure of the British Admiralty in London to pass on seven critical radio intercepts obtained by naval intelligence indicating the true position, course and intentions of the High Seas Fleet during the night. One message was transmitted to Jellicoe at 23:15 that accurately reported the German fleet&#x27;s course and speed as of 21:14. However, the erroneous signal from earlier in the day that reported the German fleet still in port, and an intelligence signal received at 22:45 giving another unlikely position for the German fleet, had reduced his confidence in intelligence reports. Had the other messages been forwarded, which confirmed the information received at 23:15, or had British ships reported accurately sightings and engagements with German destroyers, cruisers and battleships, then Jellicoe could have altered course to intercept Scheer at the Horns Reef. The unsent intercepted messages had been duly filed by the junior officer left on duty that night, who failed to appreciate their significance. By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer&#x27;s whereabouts at 04:15, the German fleet was too far away to catch and it was clear that the battle could no longer be resumed.

==Outcome==
As both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet could claim to have at least partially satisfied their objectives, both Britain and Germany have at various points claimed victory in the Battle of Jutland. There is no consensus over which nation was victorious, or if there was a victor at all.

===Reporting===
At midday on 2 June, German authorities released a press statement claiming a victory, including the destruction of a battleship, two battlecruisers, two armoured cruisers, a light cruiser, a submarine and several destroyers, for the loss of &quot;Pommern&quot; and &quot;Wiesbaden&quot;. News that &quot;Lützow&quot;, &quot;Elbing&quot; and &quot;Rostock&quot; had been scuttled was withheld, on the grounds this information would not be known to the enemy. The victory of the Skagerrak was celebrated in the press, children were given a holiday and the nation celebrated. The Kaiser announced a new chapter in world history. Post-war, the official German history hailed the battle as a victory and it continued to be celebrated until after World War II.

In Britain, the first official news came from German wireless broadcasts. Ships began to arrive in port, their crews sending messages to friends and relatives both of their survival and the loss of some 6,000 others. The authorities considered suppressing the news, but it had already spread widely. Some crews coming ashore found rumours had already reported them dead to relatives, while others were jeered for the defeat they had suffered. At 19:00 on 2 June, the Admiralty released a statement based on information from Jellicoe containing the bare news of losses on each side. The following day British newspapers reported a German victory. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; described the German Director of the Naval Department telling the &quot;Reichstag&quot;: &quot;The result of the fighting is a significant success for our forces against a much stronger adversary&quot;. The British population was shocked that the long anticipated battle had been a victory for Germany. On 3 June, the Admiralty issued a further statement expanding on German losses, and another the following day with exaggerated claims. However, on 7 June the German admission of the losses of &quot;Lützow&quot; and &quot;Rostock&quot; started to redress the sense of the battle as a loss. International perception of the battle began to change towards a qualified British victory, the German attempt to change the balance of power in the North Sea having been repulsed. In July, bad news from the Somme campaign swept concern over Jutland from the British consciousness.

===Assessments===

Jutland was the third fleet action between steel battleships, following the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1904 and the Battle of Tsushima in 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War.

At Jutland, the Germans, with a 99-strong fleet, sank of British ships, while a 151-strong British fleet sank of German ships. The British lost 6,094 seamen; the Germans 2,551. Several other ships were badly damaged, such as &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Seydlitz&quot;.

As of the summer of 1916, the High Seas Fleet&#x27;s strategy was to whittle away the numerical advantage of the Royal Navy by bringing its full strength to bear against isolated squadrons of enemy capital ships whilst declining to be drawn into a general fleet battle until it had achieved something resembling parity in heavy ships. In tactical terms, the High Seas Fleet had clearly inflicted significantly greater losses on the Grand Fleet than it had suffered itself at Jutland, and the Germans never had any intention of attempting to hold the site of the battle, so some historians support the German claim of victory at Jutland. The Germans declared a great victory immediately afterwards, while the British by contrast had only reported short and simple results. In response to public outrage, the First Lord of the Admiralty Arthur Balfour asked Winston Churchill to write a second report that was more positive and detailed.

However, Scheer seems to have quickly realised that further battles with a similar rate of attrition would exhaust the High Seas Fleet long before they reduced the Grand Fleet. Further, after the 19 August advance was nearly intercepted by the Grand Fleet, he no longer believed that it would be possible to trap a single squadron of Royal Navy warships without having the Grand Fleet intervene before he could return to port. Therefore, the High Seas Fleet abandoned its forays into the North Sea and turned its attention to the Baltic for most of 1917 whilst Scheer switched tactics against Britain to unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic.

At a strategic level, the outcome has been the subject of a huge amount of literature with no clear consensus. The battle was widely viewed as indecisive in the immediate aftermath, and this view remains influential.

Despite numerical superiority, the British had been disappointed in their hopes for a decisive battle comparable to Trafalgar and the objective of the influential strategic doctrines of Alfred Mahan. The High Seas Fleet survived as a fleet in being. Most of its losses were made good within a month—even &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, the most badly damaged ship to survive the battle, was repaired by October and officially back in service by November. However, the Germans had failed in their objective of destroying a substantial portion of the British Fleet, and no progress had been made towards the goal of allowing the High Seas Fleet to operate in the Atlantic Ocean.

Subsequently, there has been considerable support for the view of Jutland as a strategic victory for the British. While the British had not destroyed the German fleet and had lost more ships and lives than their enemy, the Germans had retreated to harbour; at the end of the battle, the British were in command of the area. Britain enforced the blockade, reducing Germany&#x27;s vital imports to 55%, affecting the ability of Germany to fight the war.

The German fleet would only sortie into the North Sea thrice more, with a raid on 19 August, one in October 1916, and another in April 1918. All three were unopposed by capital ships and quickly aborted as neither side was prepared to take the risks of mines and submarines.

Apart from these three abortive operations the High Seas Fleet—unwilling to risk another encounter with the British fleet—confined its activities to the Baltic Sea for the remainder of the war. Jellicoe issued an order prohibiting the Grand Fleet from steaming south of the line of Horns Reef owing to the threat of mines and U-boats. A German naval expert, writing publicly about Jutland in November 1918, commented, &quot;Our Fleet losses were severe. On 1 June 1916, it was clear to every thinking person that this battle must, and would be, the last one&quot;.
At the end of the battle, the British had maintained their numerical superiority and had 23 dreadnoughts ready and four battlecruisers still able to fight, while the Germans had only 10 dreadnoughts. One month after the battle, the Grand Fleet was stronger than it had been before sailing to Jutland. &quot;Warspite&quot; was dry-docked at Rosyth, returning to the fleet on 22 July, while &quot;Malaya&quot; was repaired in the floating dock at Invergordon, returning to duty on 11 July. &quot;Barham&quot; was docked for a month at Devonport before undergoing speed trials and returning to Scapa Flow on 8 July. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; stayed initially at Rosyth but transferred to dry dock at Portsmouth before returning to duty at Rosyth 21 July. &quot;Tiger&quot; was dry-docked at Rosyth and ready for service 2 July. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;Emperor of India&quot; and , which had been undergoing maintenance at the time of the battle, returned to the fleet immediately, followed shortly after by &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Ramillies&quot;. &quot;Lion&quot; initially remained ready for sea duty despite the damaged turret, then underwent a month&#x27;s repairs in July when Q turret was removed temporarily and replaced in September.

A third view, presented in a number of recent evaluations, is that Jutland, the last major fleet action between battleships, illustrated the irrelevance of battleship fleets following the development of the submarine, mine and torpedo. In this view, the most important consequence of Jutland was the decision of the Germans to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. Although large numbers of battleships were constructed in the decades between the wars, it has been argued that this outcome reflected the social dominance among naval decision-makers of battleship advocates who constrained technological choices to fit traditional paradigms of fleet action. Battleships played a relatively minor role in World War II, in which the submarine and aircraft carrier emerged as the dominant offensive weapons of naval warfare.

===British self-critique===
The official British Admiralty examination of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s performance recognised two main problems:
* British armour-piercing shells exploded outside the German armour rather than penetrating and exploding within. As a result, some German ships with only -thick armour survived hits from projectiles. Had these shells penetrated the armour and then exploded, German losses would probably have been far greater.
* Communication between ships and the British commander-in-chief was comparatively poor. For most of the battle, Jellicoe had no idea where the German ships were, even though British ships were in contact. They failed to report enemy positions, contrary to the Grand Fleet&#x27;s Battle Plan. Some of the most important signalling was carried out solely by flag instead of wireless or using redundant methods to ensure communications—a questionable procedure, given the mixture of haze and smoke that obscured the battlefield, and a foreshadowing of similar failures by habit-bound and conservatively minded professional officers of rank to take advantage of new technology in World War II.

====Shell performance====
German armour-piercing shells were far more effective than the British ones, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour. The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range. Germany had adopted trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a picric acid mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of fuze function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the armour plate. Some 17 British shells hit the side armour of the German dreadnoughts or battlecruisers. Of these, four would not have penetrated under any circumstances. Of the remaining 13, one penetrated the armour and exploded inside. This showed a 7.5% chance of proper shell function on the British side, a result of overly brittle shells and Lyddite exploding too soon.

The issue of poorly performing shells had been known to Jellicoe, who as Third Sea Lord from 1908 to 1910 had ordered new shells to be designed. However, the matter had not been followed through after his posting to sea and new shells had never been thoroughly tested. Beatty discovered the problem at a party aboard &quot;Lion&quot; a short time after the battle, when a Swedish Naval officer was present. He had recently visited Berlin, where the German navy had scoffed at how British shells had broken up on their ships&#x27; armour. The question of shell effectiveness had also been raised after the Battle of Dogger Bank, but no action had been taken. Hipper later commented, &quot;It was nothing but the poor quality of their bursting charges which saved us from disaster.&quot;

Admiral Dreyer, writing later about the battle, during which he had been captain of the British flagship &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, estimated that effective shells as later introduced would have led to the sinking of six more German capital ships, based upon the actual number of hits achieved in the battle. The system of testing shells, which remained in use up to 1944, meant that, statistically, a batch of shells of which 70% were faulty stood an even chance of being accepted. Indeed, even shells that failed this relatively mild test had still been issued to ships. Analysis of the test results afterwards by the Ordnance Board suggested the likelihood that 30–70% of shells would not have passed the standard penetration test specified by the Admiralty.

Efforts to replace the shells were initially resisted by the Admiralty, and action was not taken until Jellicoe became First Sea Lord in December 1916. As an initial response, the worst of the existing shells were withdrawn from ships in early 1917 and replaced from reserve supplies. New shells were designed, but did not arrive until April 1918, and were never used in action.

====Battlecruiser losses====
British battlecruisers were designed to chase and destroy enemy cruisers from out of the range of those ships. They were not designed to be ships of the line and exchange broadsides with the enemy. One German and three British battlecruisers were sunk—but none were destroyed by enemy shells penetrating the belt armour and detonating the magazines. Each of the British battlecruisers was penetrated through a turret roof and their magazines ignited by flash fires passing through the turret and shell-handling rooms. &quot;Lützow&quot; sustained 24 hits and her flooding could not be contained. She was eventually sunk by her escorts&#x27; torpedoes after most of her crew had been safely removed (though six trapped stokers died when the ship was scuttled). &quot;Derfflinger&quot; and &quot;Seydlitz&quot; sustained 22 hits each but reached port (although in &quot;Seydlitz&quot;&#x27;s case only just).

Jellicoe and Beatty, as well as other senior officers, gave an impression that the loss of the battlecruisers was caused by weak armour, despite reports by two committees and earlier statements by Jellicoe and other senior officers that Cordite and its management were to blame. This led to calls for armour to be increased, and an additional was placed over the relatively thin decks above magazines. To compensate for the increase in weight, ships had to carry correspondingly less fuel, water and other supplies. Whether or not thin deck armour was a potential weakness of British ships, the battle provided no evidence that it was the case. At least amongst the surviving ships, no enemy shell was found to have penetrated deck armour anywhere. The design of the new battlecruiser (which was being built at the time of the battle) was altered to give her of additional armour.

====Ammunition handling====
British and German propellant charges differed in packaging, handling, and chemistry. The British propellant was of two types, MK1 and MD. The Mark 1 cordite had a formula of 37% nitrocellulose, 58% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. It was a good propellant but burned hot and caused an erosion problem in gun barrels. The petroleum jelly served as both a lubricant and a stabiliser. Cordite MD was developed to reduce barrel wear, its formula being 65% nitrocellulose, 30% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. While cordite MD solved the gun-barrel erosion issue, it did nothing to improve its storage properties, which were poor. Cordite was very sensitive to variations of temperature, and acid propagation/cordite deterioration would take place at a very rapid rate. Cordite MD also shed micro-dust particles of nitrocellulose and iron pyrite. While cordite propellant was manageable, it required a vigilant gunnery officer, strict cordite lot control, and frequent testing of the cordite lots in the ships&#x27; magazines.

British cordite propellant (when uncased and exposed in the silk bag) tended to burn violently, causing uncontrollable &quot;flash fires&quot; when ignited by nearby shell hits. In 1945, a test was conducted by the U.S.N. Bureau of Ordnance (Bulletin of Ordnance Information, No. 245, pp. 54–60) testing the sensitivity of cordite to then-current U.S. Naval propellant powders against a measurable and repeatable flash source. It found that cordite would ignite at from the flash, the current U.S. powder at , and the U.S. flashless powder at .

This meant that about 75 times the propellant would immediately ignite when exposed to flash, as compared to the U.S. powder. British ships had inadequate protection against these flash fires. German propellant (&quot;RP C/12&quot;, handled in brass cartridge cases and used in German artillery because their sliding wedge breeches were hard to obturate with smokeless powder,) was less vulnerable and less volatile in composition. German propellants were not that different in composition from cordite—with one major exception: centralite. This was symmetrical diethyl diphenyl urea, which served as a stabiliser that was superior to the petroleum jelly used in British practice. It stored better and burned but did not explode. Stored and used in brass cases, it proved much less sensitive to flash. RP C/12 was composed of 64.13% nitrocellulose, 29.77% nitroglycerine, 5.75% centralite, 0.25% magnesium oxide and 0.10% graphite.

The Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet had also emphasised speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, cordite could not be supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open that should have been shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions. This &#x27;bad safety habit&#x27; carried over into real battle practices. Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships&#x27; magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.

The British cordite charges were stored two silk bags to a metal cylindrical container, with a 16-oz gunpowder igniter charge, which was covered with a thick paper wad, four charges being used on each projectile. The gun crews were removing the charges from their containers and removing the paper covering over the gunpowder igniter charges. The effect of having eight loads at the ready was to have of exposed explosive, with each charge leaking small amounts of gunpowder from the igniter bags. In effect, the gun crews had laid an explosive train from the turret to the magazines, and one shell hit to a battlecruiser turret was enough to end a ship.

A diving expedition during the summer of 2003 provided corroboration of this practice. It examined the wrecks of &quot;Invincible&quot;, &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, &quot;Defence&quot;, and &quot;Lützow&quot; to investigate the cause of the British ships&#x27; tendency to suffer from internal explosions. From this evidence, a major part of the blame may be laid on lax handling of the cordite propellant for the shells of the main guns. The wreck of the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; revealed cordite containers stacked in the working chamber of the X turret instead of the magazine.

There was a further difference in the propellant itself. While the German &quot;RP C/12&quot; burned when exposed to fire, it did not explode, as opposed to cordite. &quot;RP C/12&quot; was extensively studied by the British and, after World War I, would form the basis of the later Cordite SC.

The memoirs of Alexander Grant, Gunner on &quot;Lion&quot;, suggest that some British officers were aware of the dangers of careless handling of cordite:

Grant had already introduced measures onboard &quot;Lion&quot; to limit the number of cartridges kept outside the magazine and to ensure doors were kept closed, probably contributing to her survival.

On 5 June 1916, the First Lord of the Admiralty advised Cabinet Members that the three battlecruisers had been lost due to unsafe cordite management.

After the battle, the B.C.F. Gunnery Committee issued a report (at the command of Admiral David Beatty) advocating immediate changes in flash protection and charge handling. It reported, among other things, that:
* Some vent plates in magazines allowed flash into the magazines and should be retro-fitted to a new standard.
* Bulkheads in HMS &quot;Lion&quot;″s magazine showed buckling from fire under pressure (overpressure)—despite being flooded and therefore supported by water pressure—and must be made stronger.
* Doors opening inward to magazines were an extreme danger.
* Current designs of turrets could not eliminate flash from shell bursts in the turret from reaching the handling rooms.
* Ignition pads must not be attached to charges but instead be placed just before ramming.
* Better methods must be found for safe storage of ready charges than the current method.
* Some method for rapidly drowning charges already in the handling path must be devised.
* Handling scuttles (special flash-proof fittings for moving propellant charges through ship&#x27;s bulkheads), designed to handle overpressure, must be fitted.

====Gunnery====
British gunnery control systems, based on Dreyer tables, were well in advance of the German ones, as demonstrated by the proportion of main calibre hits made on the German fleet. Because of its demonstrated advantages, it was installed on ships progressively as the war went on, had been fitted to a majority of British capital ships by May 1916, and had been installed on the main guns of all but two of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s capital ships. The Royal Navy used centralised fire-control systems on their capital ships, directed from a point high up on the ship where the fall of shells could best be seen, utilising a director sight for both training and elevating the guns. In contrast, the German battlecruisers controlled the fire of turrets using a training-only director, which also did not fire the guns at once. The rest of the German capital ships were without even this innovation. German range-finding equipment was generally superior to the British FT24, as its operators were trained to a higher standard due to the complexity of the Zeiss range finders. Their stereoscopic design meant that in certain conditions they could range on a target enshrouded by smoke. The German equipment was not superior in range to the British Barr &amp; Stroud rangefinder found in the newest British capital ships, and, unlike the British range finders, the German range takers had to be replaced as often as every thirty minutes, as their eyesight became impaired, affecting the ranges provided to their gunnery equipment.

The results of the battle confirmed the value of firing guns by centralised director. The battle prompted the Royal Navy to install director firing systems in cruisers and destroyers, where it had not thus far been used, and for secondary armament on battleships.

German ships were considered to have been quicker in determining the correct range to targets, thus obtaining an early advantage. The British used a &#x27;bracket system&#x27;, whereby a salvo was fired at the best-guess range and, depending where it landed, the range was progressively corrected up or down until successive shots were landing in front of and behind the enemy. The Germans used a &#x27;ladder system&#x27;, whereby an initial volley of three shots at different ranges was used, with the centre shot at the best-guess range. The ladder system allowed the gunners to get ranging information from the three shots more quickly than the bracket system, which required waiting between shots to see how the last had landed. British ships adopted the German system.

It was determined that range finders of the sort issued to most British ships were not adequate at long range and did not perform as well as the range finders on some of the most modern ships. In 1917, range finders of base lengths of were introduced on the battleships to improve accuracy.

====Signalling====
Throughout the battle, British ships experienced difficulties with communications, whereas the Germans did not suffer such problems. The British preferred signalling using ship-to-ship flag and lamp signals, avoiding wireless, whereas the Germans used wireless successfully. One conclusion drawn was that flag signals were not a satisfactory way to control the fleet. Experience using lamps, particularly at night when issuing challenges to other ships, demonstrated this was an excellent way to advertise your precise location to an enemy, inviting a reply by gunfire. Recognition signals by lamp, once seen, could also easily be copied in future engagements.

British ships both failed to report engagements with the enemy but also, in the case of cruisers and destroyers, failed to actively seek out the enemy. A culture had arisen within the fleet of not acting without orders, which could prove fatal when any circumstances prevented orders being sent or received. Commanders failed to engage the enemy because they believed other, more senior officers must also be aware of the enemy nearby, and would have given orders to act if this was expected. Wireless, the most direct way to pass messages across the fleet (although it was being jammed by German ships), was avoided either for perceived reasons of not giving away the presence of ships or for fear of cluttering up the airwaves with unnecessary reports.

====Fleet Standing Orders====
Naval operations were governed by standing orders issued to all the ships. These attempted to set out what ships should do in all circumstances, particularly in situations where ships would have to react without referring to higher authority, or when communications failed. A number of changes were introduced as a result of experience gained in the battle.

A new signal was introduced instructing squadron commanders to act independently as they thought best while still supporting the main fleet, particularly for use when circumstances would make it difficult to send detailed orders. The description stressed that this was not intended to be the only time commanders might take independent action, but was intended to make plain times when they definitely should. Similarly, instructions on what to do if the fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away with the rest of the fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer&#x27;s destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy.

A number of opportunities to attack enemy ships by torpedo had presented themselves but had been missed. All ships, not just the destroyers armed principally with torpedoes but also battleships, were reminded that they carried torpedoes intended to be used whenever an opportunity arose. Destroyers were instructed to close the enemy fleet to fire torpedoes as soon as engagements between the main ships on either side would keep enemy guns busy directed at larger targets. Destroyers should also be ready to immediately engage enemy destroyers if they should launch an attack, endeavouring to disrupt their chances of launching torpedoes and keep them away from the main fleet.

To add some flexibility when deploying for attack, a new signal was provided for deploying the fleet to the centre, rather than as previously only either to left or right of the standard closed-up formation for travelling. The fast and powerful 5th Battle Squadron was moved to the front of the cruising formation so it would have the option of deploying left or right depending upon the enemy position. In the event of engagements at night, although the fleet still preferred to avoid night fighting, a destroyer and cruiser squadron would be specifically detailed to seek out the enemy and launch destroyer attacks.

==Controversy==

At the time, Jellicoe was criticised for his caution and allowing Scheer to escape. Beatty, in particular, was convinced Jellicoe had missed a tremendous opportunity to annihilate the High Seas Fleet and win what would amount to another Trafalgar. Jellicoe was promoted away from active command to become First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy, while Beatty replaced him as commander of the Grand Fleet.

The controversy raged within the navy and in public for about a decade after the war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe&#x27;s decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the south-east, and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. Supporters of Jellicoe, including the historian Cyril Falls, pointed to the folly of risking defeat in battle when one already has command of the sea. Jellicoe himself, in a letter to the Admiralty seventeen months before the battle, said that he intended to turn his fleet away from any mass torpedo attack (that being the universally accepted proper tactical response to such attacks, practised by all the major navies of the world). He said that, in the event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away, he would assume they intended to draw him over mines or submarines, and he would decline to be so drawn. The Admiralty approved this plan and expressed full confidence in Jellicoe at the time (October 1914).

The stakes were high, the pressure on Jellicoe immense, and his caution it may be argued was understandable. Jellicoe had not only the responsibility of immediate command of the Grand Fleet, the defence of the British waters and British trade; but also of the maintenance of the blockade of Germany which hinged on the continuing presence and superiority of the Grand Fleet. Therefore, Jellicoe had to consider the wider strategic consequences of his actions and results of the battle; which outweighed the short term benefits of a more outright victory. Churchill said of the battle that Jellicoe &quot;was the only man on either side who could have lost the war in an afternoon.&quot;

The criticism of Jellicoe also fails to sufficiently credit Scheer, who was determined to preserve his fleet by avoiding the full British battle line, and who showed great skill in effecting his escape.

===Beatty&#x27;s actions===
On the other hand, some of Jellicoe&#x27;s supporters condemned the actions of Beatty for the British failure to achieve a complete victory. Although Beatty was undeniably brave, his mismanagement of the initial encounter with Hipper&#x27;s squadron and the High Seas Fleet cost him a considerable advantage in the first hours of the battle. His most glaring failure was in not providing Jellicoe with periodic information on the position, course, and speed of the High Seas Fleet. Beatty, aboard the battlecruiser &quot;Lion&quot;, left behind the four fast battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron—the most powerful warships in the world at the time—engaging with six ships when better control would have given him 10 against Hipper&#x27;s five. Though Beatty&#x27;s larger guns out-ranged Hipper&#x27;s guns by thousands of yards, Beatty held his fire for 10 minutes and closed the German squadron until within range of the Germans&#x27; superior gunnery, under lighting conditions that favoured the Germans. Most of the British losses in tonnage occurred in Beatty&#x27;s force.

==Death toll==

The total loss of life on both sides was 9,823 personnel: the British losses numbered 6,784 and the German 3,039. Counted among the British losses were two members of the Royal Australian Navy and one member of the Royal Canadian Navy. Six Australian nationals serving in the Royal Navy were also killed.

==Status of the survivors and wrecks==

In the years following the battle the wrecks were slowly discovered. &quot;Invincible&quot; was found by the Royal Navy minesweeper in 1919. After the Second World War some of the wrecks seem to have been commercially salvaged. For instance, the Hydrographic Office record for SMS &quot;Lützow&quot; (No. 32344) shows that salvage operations were taking place on the wreck in 1960.

During 2000–2016 a series of diving and marine survey expeditions involving veteran shipwreck historian and archaeologist Innes McCartney located all of the wrecks sunk in the battle. It was discovered that over 60 per cent of them had suffered from metal theft. In 2003 McCartney led a detailed survey of the wrecks for the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Clash of the Dreadnoughts&quot;. The film examined the last minutes of the lost ships and revealed for the first time how both &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets of &quot;Invincible&quot; had been blasted out of the ship and tossed into the sea before she broke in half. This was followed by the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Jutland: WWI&#x27;s Greatest Sea Battle&quot;, broadcast in May 2016, which showed how several of the major losses at Jutland had actually occurred and just how accurate the &quot;Harper Record&quot; actually was.

On the 90th anniversary of the battle, in 2006, the UK Ministry of Defence belatedly announced that the 14 British vessels lost in the battle were being designated as &quot;protected places&quot; under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. This legislation only affects British ships and citizens and in practical terms offers no real protection from non-British salvors of the wreck sites. In May 2016 a number of British newspapers named the Dutch salvage company &quot;Friendship Offshore&quot; as one of the main salvors of the Jutland wrecks in recent years and depicted leaked photographs revealing the extent of their activities on the wreck of &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.

The last surviving veteran of the battle, Henry Allingham, a British RAF (originally RNAS) airman, died on 18 July 2009, aged 113, by which time he was the oldest documented man in the world and one of the last surviving veterans of the whole war. Also among the combatants was the then 20-year-old Prince Albert, serving as a junior officer aboard . He was second in the line to the throne, but would become king as George VI following his brother Edward&#x27;s abdication in 1936.

One ship from the battle survives and is still (in 2024) afloat: the light cruiser . Decommissioned in 2011, she is docked at the Alexandra Graving Dock in Belfast, Northern Ireland and is a museum ship.

==Remembrance==
The Battle of Jutland was annually celebrated as a great victory by the right wing in Weimar Germany. This victory was used to repress the memory that the Kiel sailors&#x27; mutiny initiated the German Revolution of 1918–1919, as well as the memory of the defeat in World War I in general. (The celebrations of the Battle of Tannenberg played a similar role.) This is especially true for the city of Wilhelmshaven, where wreath-laying ceremonies and torch-lit parades were performed until the end of the 1960s.

In 1916 Contreadmiral Friedrich von Kühlwetter (1865–1931) wrote a detailed analysis of the battle and published it in a book under the title &quot;Skagerrak&quot; (first anonymously published), which was reprinted in large numbers until after WWII and had a huge influence in keeping the battle in public memory amongst Germans as it was not tainted by the ideology of the Third Reich. Kühlwetter built the School for Naval Officers at Mürwik near Flensburg, where he is still remembered.

May 2016 marked the 100th-anniversary of the Battle of Jutland. On 29 May, a commemorative service was held at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Wimbledon, where the ensign from HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot; is on permanent display. On 31 May, the main service was held at St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, attended by the British prime minister, David Cameron, and the German president, Joachim Gauck, along with Princess Anne and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. Another service was held on board HMS &quot;Duncan&quot;, attended by both British and German sailors, while the German frigate &quot;Brandenburg&quot; laid a flower wreath at the site of the sinking of HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;.

<text>Bambara, also known as Bamana (N&#x27;Ko script: ) or Bamanankan (N&#x27;Ko script: ; Arabic script: ), is a lingua franca and national language of Mali spoken by perhaps 14 million people, natively by 4.2 million Bambara people and about 10 million second-language users. It is estimated that about 80 percent of the population of Mali speak Bambara as a first or second language. It has a subject–object–verb clause structure and two lexical tones.

== Classification ==
Bambara is a variety of a group of closely related languages called Manding, whose native speakers trace their cultural history to the medieval Mali Empire. Varieties of Manding are generally considered (among native speakers) to be mutually intelligible – dependent on exposure or familiarity with dialects between speakers – and spoken by 9.1 million people in the countries Burkina Faso, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast and the Gambia. Manding is part of the larger Mandé family of languages.

==Geographical distribution==
Bambara is spoken throughout Mali as a lingua franca. The language is most widely spoken in the areas east, south, and north of Bamako, where native speakers and/or those that identify as members of the Bambara ethnic group are most densely populated. These regions are also usually considered to be the historical geographical origin of Bambara people, particularly Ségou, after diverging from other Manding groups.

==Dialects==
The main dialect is Standard Bamara, which has significant influence from Maninkakan. Bambara has many local dialects: Kaarta, Tambacounda (west); Beledugu, Bananba, Mesekele (north); Jitumu, Jamaladugu, Segu (center); Cakadugu, Keleyadugu, Jalakadougu, Kurulamini, Banimɔncɛ, Cɛmala, Cɛndugu, Baninkɔ, Shɛndugu, Ganadugu (south); Kala, Kuruma, Saro, dialects to the northeast of Mopti (especially Bɔrɛ); Zegedugu, Bɛndugu, Bakɔkan, Jɔnka (southeast).

==Writing==

Since 1967, Bambara has mostly been written in the Latin script, using some additional phonetic characters from the Africa Alphabet. The vowels are &quot;a, e, ɛ&quot; (formerly &quot;è&quot;), &quot;i, o, ɔ&quot; (formerly &quot;ò&quot;), &quot;u&quot;; accents can be used to indicate tonality. The former digraph &quot;ny&quot; is now written &quot;ɲ&quot; when it designates a palatal nasal; the &quot;ny&quot; spelling is kept for the combination of a nasal vowel with a subsequent oral palatal glide. Following the 1966 Bamako spelling conventions, a velar nasal &quot;ŋ&quot; is written as &quot;ŋ&quot;, although in early publications it was often transcribed as &quot;ng&quot; or &quot;nk&quot;.

The N&#x27;Ko () alphabet is a script devised by Solomana Kante in 1949 as a writing system for the Manding languages of West Africa; N’Ko means &#x27;I say&#x27; in all Manding languages. Kante created N’Ko in response to what he felt were beliefs that Africans were a &quot;cultureless people&quot; since prior to this time there had been no indigenous African writing system for his language. N&#x27;ko first gained a strong user base around the Maninka-speaking area of Kante&#x27;s hometown of Kankan, Guinea and disseminated from there into other Manding-speaking parts of West Africa. N&#x27;ko and the Arabic script are still in use for Bambara, although only the Latin-based orthography is officially recognized in Mali.

Additionally, a script known as Masaba or Ma-sa-ba was developed for the language beginning in 1930 by Woyo Couloubayi (-1982) of Assatiémala. Named for the first characters in Couloubayi&#x27;s preferred collation order, Masaba is a syllabary which uses diacritics to indicate vowel qualities such as tone, length, and nasalization. Though not conclusively demonstrated to be related to other writing systems, Masaba appears to draw on traditional Bambara iconography and shares some similarities with the Vai syllabary of Liberia and with Arabic-derived secret alphabets used in Hodh (now Hodh El Gharbi and Hodh Ech Chargui Regions of Mauritania). As of 1978, Masaba was in limited use in several communities in Nioro Cercle for accounting, personal correspondence, and the recording of Muslim prayers; the script&#x27;s current status and prevalence is unknown.
===Latin orthography===
It uses seven vowels a, e, ɛ, i, o, ɔ and u, each of which can be nasalized, pharyngealized and murmured, giving a total number of 21 vowels (the letters approximate their equivalents). 
Writing with the Latin alphabet began during the French colonization, and the first orthography was introduced in 1967. Literacy is limited, especially in rural areas. Although written literature is only slowly evolving (due to the predominance of French as the &quot;language of the educated&quot;), there exists a wealth of oral literature, which is often tales of kings and heroes. This oral literature is mainly passed on by the griots (&quot;Jeliw&quot; in Bambara) who are a mixture of storytellers, praise singers, and human history books who have studied the trade of singing and reciting for many years. Many of their songs are very old and are said to date back to the old empire of Mali.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Each consonant represents a single sound with some exceptions:
* &quot;W&quot; is pronounced as in English (e.g. wait) except at the end of a word, when it is the plural mark and is pronounced as [u].
* &quot;S&quot; is pronounced most often as in the English word &quot;see&quot; but is sometimes pronounced as &quot;sh&quot; [ʃ] as in the word &quot;shoe&quot; or as [z].
* &quot;G&quot; is pronounced most often as in the English word &quot;go&quot; but in the middle of a word, it can be pronounced as in the Spanish word &quot;abogado&quot; ([ɣ]) and sometimes at the beginning of a word as [gw].

=== Vowels ===
==Grammar==
The basic sentence structure is subject–object–verb (SOV). Take the phrase, &quot;n t&#x27;a lon&quot; (I don&#x27;t know [it]). &quot;n&quot; is the subject (I), &quot;a&quot; is the object (it), and &quot;[ta] lon&quot; is the verb ([to] know). The &quot;t&#x27; &quot; is from the negative present tense marker &quot;té&quot;, &quot;bé&quot; being the affirmative present tense marker (&quot;n b&#x27;a don&quot; would mean &quot;I know it&quot;). Like many SOV languages, Bambara uses postpositions rather than prepositions - their role being similar to English prepositions but placed after the noun.

The language has two (mid/standard and high) tones; e.g. &quot;sa&quot; &#x27;die&#x27; vs. &quot;sá&quot; &#x27;snake.&#x27; The typical argument structure of the language consists of a subject, followed by an aspectival auxiliary, followed by the direct object, and finally a transitive verb.

Bambara does not inflect for gender. Gender for a noun can be specified by adding a suffix, &quot;-cɛ&quot; or &quot;-kɛ&quot; for male and &quot;-muso&quot; for female. The plural is formed by attaching a vocalic suffix &quot;-u&quot;, most often with a low tone (in the orthography, &quot;-w&quot;) to nouns or adjectives.

===Loan words===
In urban areas, many Bamanankan conjunctions have been replaced in everyday use by French borrowings that often mark code-switches. The Bamako dialect makes use of sentences like: &quot;N taara Kita mais il n&#x27;y avait personne là-bas.&quot; : &quot;I went to Kita [Bamanankan ] but there was no one there [French].&quot; The sentence in Bamanankan alone would be &quot;Ń taara Kita nka mɔkɔ si tun tɛ yen.&quot; The French proposition &quot;est-ce que&quot; is also used in Bamanankan ; however, it is pronounced more slowly and as three syllables, .

Bamanankan uses many French loan words. For example, some people might say: &quot;I ka kurusi ye nere ye&quot;: &quot;Your skirt is yellow&quot; (using a derivation of &quot;jaune&quot;, the French word for yellow, they often use &quot;joni&quot;.)

However, one could also say: &quot;I ka kulosi ye nɛrɛmukuman ye&quot;, also meaning &quot;your skirt is yellow.&quot; The original Bamanankan word for yellow comes from &quot;&quot;nɛrɛmuku&quot;,&quot; being flour (&quot;muku&quot;) made from néré (locust bean), a seed from a long seed pod. Nɛrɛmuku is often used in sauces in Southern Mali.

Most French loan words are suffixed with the sound &#x27;i&#x27;; this is particularly common when using French words which have a meaning not traditionally found in Mali. For example, the Bamanankan word for snow is &quot;niegei&quot;, based on the French word for snow &quot;neige&quot;. As there has never been snow in Mali, there was no unique word in Bamanankan to describe it.

===Examples===


==Music==
Malian artists such as Oumou Sangaré, Sidiki Diabaté, Fatoumata Diawara, Rokia Traoré, Ali Farka Touré, Habib Koité and the married duo Amadou &amp; Mariam often sing in Bambara. Lyrics in Bambara occur on &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;.&quot; In 2010, Spanish rock group Dover released its 7th studio album &quot;I Ka Kené&quot; with the majority of lyrics in Bambara, Spanish, English and French. American rapper Nas also released a track titled &quot;Patience&quot; in 2010, which featured Damian Marley and extensively sampled the Amadou &amp; Mariam song &quot;Sabali&quot;, as &quot;sabali&quot; is a Bambara word meaning patience.

==Legal status==
Bambara was until 2023 one of several languages designated by Mali as a national language.

In 2023, after a new constitution was approved by a majority of voters, Bambara became co-official, together with 12 other languages spoken in the country. French was removed as the official language and was kept only as a working language.

<text>Baku (, ; ) is the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus region. Baku is below sea level, which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world below sea level. Baku lies on the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula, on the Bay of Baku. Baku&#x27;s urban population was estimated at two million people as of 2009. Baku is the primate city of Azerbaijan—it is the sole metropolis in the country, and about 25% of all inhabitants of the country live in Baku&#x27;s metropolitan area.

Baku is divided into twelve administrative raions and 48 townships. Among these are the townships on the islands of the Baku Archipelago, as well as the industrial settlement of Neft Daşları built on oil rigs away from Baku city in the Caspian Sea. The Old City, containing the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and the Maiden Tower, was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.

The city is the scientific, cultural, and industrial centre of Azerbaijan. Many sizeable Azerbaijani institutions have their headquarters there. In the 2010s, Baku became a venue for major international events. It hosted the 57th Eurovision Song Contest in 2012, the 2015 European Games, 4th Islamic Solidarity Games, the European Grand Prix in 2016, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix since 2017, the final of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, UEFA Euro 2020 and 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The Baku International Sea Trade Port is capable of handling two million tonnes of general and dry bulk cargoes per year. Baku is renowned for its harsh winds, reflected in its nickname, the &quot;City of Winds&quot;.

==Etymology==
Baku is long attested under the Perso-Arabic name باکو (&quot;Bākū&quot;). Early Arabic sources also refer to the city as &quot;Bākuh&quot; and &quot;Bākuya&quot;, all of which seem to come from a Persian name. The further etymology is unclear.

A popular etymology in the 19th century considered it to be derived from Persian بادکوبه (&quot;Bâd-kube&quot;, meaning &quot;wind-pounded city&quot;, a compound of &quot;bād&quot;, &quot;wind&quot;, and &quot;kube&quot;, which is rooted in the verb کوبیدن &quot;kubidan&quot;, &quot;to pound&quot;, thus referring to a place where wind would be strong and pounding, as is the case of Baku, which is known to experience fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds). This popular name (&quot;Badkubə&quot; in modern Azerbaijani script) gained currency as a nickname for the city by the 19th century (e.g., it is used in &quot;Akinchi&quot;, volume 1, issue 1, p. 1), and is also reflected in the city&#x27;s modern nickname as the &quot;City of Winds&quot; (). Another and even less probable folk etymology explains the name as deriving from &quot;Baghkuy&quot;, meaning &quot;God&#x27;s town&quot;. &quot;Baga&quot; (now &quot;بغ&quot; &quot;bagh&quot;) and &quot;kuy&quot; are the Old Persian words for &quot;god&quot; and &quot;town&quot; respectively; the name &quot;Baghkuy&quot; may be compared with &quot;Baghdād&quot; (&quot;God-given&quot;) in which &quot;dād&quot; is the Old Persian word for &quot;give&quot;.

During Soviet rule, the city was spelled in Cyrillic as &quot;Бакы&quot; in Azerbaijani (while the Russian spelling was and still is &quot;Баку&quot;, &quot;&quot;). The modern Azerbaijani spelling, which has been using the Latin alphabet since 1991, is ; the shift from the Perso-Arabic letter و (&quot;ū&quot;) to Cyrillic &quot;ы&quot; and, later, Latin &quot;ı&quot; may be compared to that in other Azerbaijani words (e.g. compare &quot;qāpū&quot; in old Perso-Arabic spelling with modern Azerbaijani , &quot;door&quot;) or in suffixes, as و was often used to transcribe the vowel harmony in Azerbaijani (which was also the practice in Ottoman Turkish). (See also Azerbaijani alphabet.)

==History==
===Antiquity===

Traces of human settlement in the region of present-day Baku date back to the Stone Age. Bronze Age rock carvings have been discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish in the territory of the Old City. These have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze-Age settlement within the city&#x27;s territory. Near Nardaran, a place called Umid Gaya features a prehistoric observatory, where images of the sun and of various constellations are carved into rock together with a primitive astronomic table. Further archeological excavations have revealed various prehistoric settlements, native temples, statues and other artifacts within the territory of the modern city and around it.

In the 1st century AD, the Romans organised two Caucasian campaigns and reached what is today Baku. Near the city, in what is today Gobustan, Roman inscriptions dating from AD 84 to 96 survive – some of the earliest written evidences for a city there.

According to the 6th-century archbishop and historian St. Sophronius of Cyprus, in 71, St. Bartholomew the Apostle was preaching Christianity in the city of Albana or Albanopolis, associated with present-day Baku or Derbent, both located by the Caspian Sea. St. Bartholomew managed to convert even members of the local royal family who had worshipped the idol Astaroth, but was later martyred by being flayed alive and crucified head down on orders from the pagan king Astyages. The remains of St. Bartholomew were secretly transferred to Mesopotamia.

===Rise of the Shirvanshahs and the Safavid era===
Baku was the realm of the Shirvanshahs during the 8th century AD. The city frequently came under assault from the Khazars and (starting from the 10th century) from the Rus&#x27;. Akhsitan I built a navy in Baku and successfully repelled a Rus&#x27; assault in 1170. After a devastating earthquake struck Shamakhi, the capital of Shirvan, Shirvanshah&#x27;s court moved to Baku in 1191.
The Shirvan era greatly influenced Baku and the remainder of present-day Azerbaijan. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, massive fortifications were built in Baku and the surrounding towns. The Maiden Tower, the Ramana Tower, the Nardaran Fortress, the Shagan Castle, the Mardakan Castle, the Round Castle and also the Sabayil Castle on the island of the Bay of Baku date from this period. The city walls of Baku were also rebuilt and strengthened.

By the early 16th century, Baku&#x27;s wealth and strategic position attracted the attention of its larger neighbours; in the previous two centuries, it was under the rule of the Iran-centred Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed Iranian Safavid dynasty, led by king (&quot;shah&quot;) Ismail I (). Ismail I laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it; he allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty. His successor, king Tahmasp I (), completely removed the Shirvanshahs from power and made Baku a part of the Shirvan province. Baku remained as an integral part of his empire and of successive Iranian dynasties for the next centuries, until ceded to the Russian Empire through the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan. The House of Shirvan, which had ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished in the course of Safavid rule.

At this time, the city was enclosed within lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. The Ottomans briefly gained control over Baku as a result of the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578–1590; by 1607, it came under Iranian control again. In 1604 Shah Abbas I () destroyed Baku fortress.
Baku had a reputation as a focal point for traders from across the world during the Early modern period; commerce was active and the area prospered. Notably, traders from the Indian subcontinent established themselves in the region. These Indian traders built the Ateshgah of Baku during 17th–18th centuries; the temple was used as a Hindu, Sikh, and Zoroastrian place of worship.

=== Downfall of the Safavids and the Khanate of Baku ===
The Safavids temporarily lost power in Iran in 1722; Emperor Peter the Great of Russia took advantage of the situation and invaded. As a result of the Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723, the Safavids were forced to cede Baku to Russia. By 1730 the situation had deteriorated for the Russians; the successes of Nader Shah () led them to sign the Treaty of Ganja near Ganja on 10 March 1735, ceding the city and all other conquered territories in the Caucasus back to Iran.

The eruption of instability following Nader Shah&#x27;s death in 1747 gave rise to the various Caucasian khanates. The semi-autonomous Persian-ruled

=== Russo-Persian Wars and Iran&#x27;s cession ===
From the late 18th century, Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geopolitical stance towards its two neighbours and rivals to the south, namely Iran and the Ottoman Empire. In the spring of 1796, by Catherine II&#x27;s order, General Valerian Zubov&#x27;s troops started a large campaign against Qajar Persia. Zubov had sent 13,000 men to capture Baku, and it was overrun subsequently without any resistance. On 13 June 1796, a Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay, and a garrison of Russian troops was stationed inside the city. Later, however, Emperor Paul I of Russia ordered the cessation of the campaign and the withdrawal of Russian forces following the death of his predecessor, Catherine the Great. In March 1797 the tsarist troops left Baku and the city became part of Qajar Iran again.

In 1813, following the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813, Qajar Iran had to sign the Treaty of Gulistan with Russia this provided for the cession of Baku and of most of Iran&#x27;s territories in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus to Russia. During the next and final bout of hostilities between the two, the Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828, the Iranians briefly recaptured Baku. However, the militarily superior Russians ended this war with a victory as well, and the resulting Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) made Baku&#x27;s inclusion in the Russian Empire definite. When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the war of 1804–13, nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic Tat. Baku within Russia was the administrative center of the Baku Uyezd, Baku Governorate, and the Baku Gradonachalstvo.

=== Discovery of oil ===

The Russians built the first oil-distilling factory in Balaxani in 1837. The first person to drill oil in Baku was an ethnic Armenian Ivan Mirzoev, who is also known as a &#x27;founding father of Baku&#x27;s oil industry.&#x27; Digging for oil began in the 1840s, with the first oil well drilled in the Bibi-Heybat suburb of Baku in 1846. Large-scale oil exploration started in 1872 when the Russian imperial authorities auctioned parcels of oil-rich land around Baku to private investors. The pioneer of oil extracting from the bottom of the sea was the Polish geologist Witold Zglenicki. Soon after, investors appeared in Baku, including the Nobel Brothers in 1873 and the Rothschilds in 1882. An industrial area of oil refineries, better known as Black Town (), developed near Baku by the early 1880s.

Professor A. V. Williams Jackson of Columbia University wrote in his work &quot;From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam&quot; (1911):
By the beginning of the 20th century, half of the oil sold in international markets was extracted in Baku. The oil boom contributed to the massive growth of Baku. Between 1856 and 1910 Baku&#x27;s population grew at a faster rate than that of London, Paris, New York, or Tokyo.

=== World War I ===

In 1917, after the October Revolution and amidst the turmoil of World War I and the Russian Revolution, Baku came under the control of the Baku Commune, led by the veteran Bolshevik Stepan Shahumyan. Seeking to capitalize on the existing ethnic conflicts, by spring 1918, Bolsheviks inspired and condoned civil war in and around Baku. During the March Days of 1918, Bolsheviks and Dashnaks, seeking to establish control over Baku streets, faced armed Azerbaijani groups. The Azerbaijanis suffered defeat from the united forces of the Baku Soviet and were massacred by Dashnak teams in what was called the March Days. An estimated 3,000–12,000 Azerbaijanis were killed in their own capital. After the massacre, on 28 May 1918, the Azerbaijani faction of the Transcaucasian Sejm proclaimed the independence of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) in Ganja, thereby founding the first Muslim-majority democratic and secular republic. The newly independent Azerbaijani republic, being unable to defend the independence of the country on their own, asked the Ottoman Empire for military support in accordance with clause 4 of the treaty between the two countries. Shortly after, Azerbaijani forces, with support of the Ottoman Army of Islam led by Nuru Pasha, started their advance on Baku, eventually capturing the city from the loose coalition of Bolsheviks, SRs, Dashnaks, Mensheviks and British forces under the command of General Lionel Dunsterville on 15 September 1918.

After the Battle of Baku of August–September 1918, the Azerbaijani irregular troops, with the tacit support of the Turkish command, conducted four days of pillaging and killing 10,000–30,000 Armenians of Baku. This pogrom became known as the &quot;September Days&quot;. Shortly after this, Baku was proclaimed the new capital of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

The Ottoman Empire, recognising defeat in World War I by October 1918, signed the Armistice of Mudros with the British (30 October 1918); this meant the evacuation of Turkish forces from Baku. Headed by General William Thomson, some 5,000 British troops, including parts of the former Dunsterforce, arrived in Baku on 17 November. Thomson declared himself military governor of Baku and implemented martial law in the city until &quot;the civil power would be strong enough to release the forces from the responsibility to maintain the public order&quot;. British forces left before the end of 1919.

=== Soviet period ===
The independence of the Azerbaijani republic was a significant but short-lived chapter in Baku&#x27;s history. On 28 April 1920, the 11th Red Army invaded Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.

The city underwent many major changes. As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of Soviet life. Baku was the major oil city of the Soviet Union. From about 1921 the city was headed by the Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as &quot;Bakgorispolkom&quot;. Together with Baku Party Committee (known as the &quot;Baksovet&quot;), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930 Baku became the venue for one of the major trade fairs of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.

=== World War II ===

The major powers continued to note Baku&#x27;s growing importance as a major energy hub. During World War II (1939–1945) and particularly during the 1942 Nazi German invasion of the southwestern Soviet Union, Baku became of vital strategic importance to the Axis powers. In fact, capturing the oil fields of Baku was a primary goal of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Operation Edelweiss, carried out between May and November 1942. However, the German Army reached only a point some northwest of Baku in November 1942, falling far short of the city&#x27;s capture before being driven back during the Soviet Operation Little Saturn in mid-December 1942.

=== Fall of the Soviet Union and later ===
After the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history. Thousands of panel buildings from the Soviet period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the Baku Bay. Improvements were made in general cleaning, maintenance, and garbage collection to bring these services up to Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at pace on an east–west axis along the shores of the Caspian Sea. Sustainability has become a key factor in future urban development.

== Geography ==

Baku is situated on the western coast of the Caspian Sea. In the vicinity of the city there are a number of mud volcanoes (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, Lokbatan and others) and salt lakes (Boyukshor, Khodasan, etc.).

=== Climate ===
Baku has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;) with hot and humid summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with such climate features, Baku does not see extremely hot summers and substantial sunshine hours. This is largely because of its northerly latitude and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea.

Baku, and the Absheron Peninsula on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan (precipitation here is around or less than a year). This is largely due to the rain shadow effect from the Caucasus Mountains, with corresponding latitudes on the Black Sea on average receiving or more. The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these seasons is particularly wet.

During Soviet times, Baku, with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated spa complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea. The city&#x27;s past as a Soviet industrial centre left it one of the most polluted cities in the world, .

At the same time, Baku is noted as a very windy city throughout the year, hence the city&#x27;s nickname the &quot;City of Winds&quot;, and gale-force winds, the cold northern wind &quot;khazri&quot; and the warm southern wind &quot;gilavar&quot; are typical here in all seasons. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.
The speed of the &quot;khazri&quot; sometimes reaches , which can cause damage to crops, trees and roof tiles.

The daily mean temperature in July and August averages , and there is very little rainfall during that season. During summer, the &quot;khazri&quot; sweeps through, bringing desired coolness. Winter is cool and occasionally wet, with the daily mean temperature in January and February averaging . During winter, the &quot;khazri&quot; sweeps through, driven by polar air masses; temperatures on the coast frequently drop below freezing and make it feel bitterly cold. Winter snow storms are occasional; snow usually melts within a few days after each snowfall.

== Administrative divisions ==
Baku is divided into 12 &quot;rayonlar (sub-rayons)&quot; (administrative districts) and 5 settlements of city type.
* Binagadi (Binəqədi) raion
* Garadagh (Qaradağ) raion
* Khatai (Xətai) raion
* Khazar (Xəzər) raion
* Narimanov (Nərimanov) raion
* Nasimi (Nəsimi) raion
* Nizami raion
* Pirallahi (Pirallahı) raion
* Sabail (Səbail) raion
* Sabunchu (Sabunçu) raion
* Surakhani (Suraxanı) raion
* Yasamal raion
== Demographics ==
Until 1988, Baku had very large Russian, Armenian, and Jewish populations which contributed to cultural diversity and added in various ways (music, literature, architecture and progressive outlook) to Baku&#x27;s history. With the onset of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War and the pogrom against Armenians starting in January 1990, the city&#x27;s large Armenian population was expelled. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev returned several synagogues and a Jewish college, nationalised by the Soviets, to the Jewish community; he encouraged the restoration of these buildings. Seven of the original 11 synagogues, including the Gilah synagogue, built in 1896, and the large Kruei Synagogue, were renovated.



=== Ethnic groups ===

Today, the vast majority of Baku&#x27;s population is made up of ethnic Azerbaijanis, and the rest are Talysh, Russians, Lezgi and others. The intensive growth of the population started in the middle of the 19th century when Baku was a small town with a population of about 7,000 people. The population increased again from about 13,000 in the 1860s to 112,000 in 1897 and 215,000 in 1913, making Baku the largest city in the Caucasus region.

Baku has been a cosmopolitan city at certain times during its history, meaning ethnic Azerbaijanis did not constitute the majority of population. It was only in the 1970s that ethnic Azerbaijanis achieved demographic dominance in Baku. In 2003 Baku additionally had 153,400 internally displaced persons and 93,400 refugees.

=== Religion ===

The religion with the largest community of followers is Islam. The majority of the Muslims are Shia Muslims, and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second-highest Shia population percentage in the world, after Iran. The city&#x27;s notable mosques include Juma Mosque, Bibi-Heybat Mosque, Muhammad Mosque and Taza Pir Mosque.

There are some other faiths practised among the different ethnic groups within the country. By article 48 of its Constitution, Azerbaijan is a secular state and ensures religious freedom. Religious minorities include Russian Orthodox Christians, Catholic Levantines, Georgian Orthodox Christians, Albanian-Udi Apostolic Christians, Lutherans, Ashkenazi Jews, and Sufi Muslims. Baku is the seat of the Catholic Apostolic Prefecture of Azerbaijan.

Zoroastrianism, although extinct in the city as well as in the rest of the country by the present time, had a long history in Azerbaijan and the Zoroastrian New Year (Nowruz) continues to be the main holiday in the city as well as in the rest of Azerbaijan.

== Economy ==

Baku is the economic hub of Azerbaijan, hosting many of the country&#x27;s major companies and serving as the center for key industries such as oil and gas, finance, trade, and technology. The city is home to major financial institutions, multinational corporations, and various businesses that contribute to the country’s economy. Baku accounts for approximately 65% of Azerbaijan’s total GDP. Azerbaijani conglomerates such as PASHA Holding which is headquartered in Baku, and AF Holding, operate in the city. Baku also attracts a significant portion of the country’s workforce, with many people relocating for job opportunities and business prospects. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 52% of hired workers in Azerbaijan were employed in Baku. In addition to its role as the economic hub, Baku is home to the largest port in the Caspian Sea, the Baku International Sea Trade Port, more commonly known as Port of Baku. It handles a wide range of cargo, including containers, bulk goods, and liquid cargo, with an annual capacity of 15 million tons of cargo. The port also plays an essential role in the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, facilitating trade between East Asia, Central Asia, Europe, and the Caucasus through integrated sea, rail, and road transport.

Baku&#x27;s largest industry is petroleum, and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to Azerbaijan&#x27;s balance of payments. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku. By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells. Commercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the Baku oil fields were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century, much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century skilled workers and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of oil industry equipment before World War II. The World War II Battle of Stalingrad was fought to determine who would have control of Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world&#x27;s oil supply.

The oil economy of Baku is undergoing a resurgence, with the development of the massive Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field (Shallow water Gunashli by SOCAR, deeper areas by a consortium led by BP), development of the Shah Deniz gas field, the expansion of the Sangachal Terminal and the construction of the BTC Pipeline. The South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP), also known as the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum Pipeline, transports natural gas from Azerbaijan&#x27;s Shah Deniz gas field to Turkey, with further connections to Europe. Spanning over 690 kilometers, the pipeline has been operational since 2007 and plays a central role in the Southern Gas Corridor, which aims to diversify Europe&#x27;s energy sources with an annual export capacity of up to 25 billion cubic metres of gas.

The Baku Stock Exchange is Azerbaijan&#x27;s largest stock exchange, and largest in the Caucasian region by market capitalization. A relatively large number of transnational companies are headquartered in Baku. One of the more prominent institutions headquartered in Baku is the International Bank of Azerbaijan, which employs over 1,000 people. International banks with branches in Baku include HSBC, Société Générale and Credit Suisse.

=== Tourism and shopping ===


Baku is one of the most important tourist destinations in the Caucasus, with hotels in the city earning 7 million euros in 2009. Many sizable world hotel chains have a presence in the city. Baku has many popular tourist and entertainment spots, such as the downtown Fountains Square, the One and Thousand Nights Beach, Shikhov Beach and Oil Rocks. Baku&#x27;s vicinities feature Yanar Dag, an ever-blazing spot of natural gas. On 2 September 2010 with the inauguration of National Flag Square, Baku set the world record for tallest flagpole; on 24 May 2011, the city of Dushanbe in Tajikistan set a new record with a -higher flagpole. A few years later, the Flag Pole was dismantled and the National Flag Square was closed off with fences. It was opened once again after years of repair on On November 8, 2024, to commemorate the Victory Day over Armenia&#x27;s forces in Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. The National Flag Square features a museum, with a collection of about 400 items, along with flags of Khanates and Empires that have been prevalent in the region.

Baku has several shopping malls, including Ganjlik Mall, Deniz Mall, Crescent Mall, Port Baku Mall, 28 Mall, Park Bulvar, City Park and Metro Park.

=== Architecture ===

Baku has wildly varying architecture, ranging from the Old City core to modern buildings and the spacious layout of Baku port. Many of the city&#x27;s landmarks were built during the early 20th century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in eclectic style. Baku has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the &quot;Paris of the East&quot;. Baku joined UNESCO&#x27;s Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on 31 October 2019 on the occasion of World Cities&#x27; Day.

==== Hamams ====

There are a number of ancient hamams in Baku dating back to the 12th, 14th and 18th centuries. Hamams play a very important role in the architectural appearance of Baku.

===== Teze Bey Hamam =====
Teze Bey is the most popular hamam (traditional Islamic bath) in Baku. It was built in 1886 in the centre of Baku, and in 2003 it was fully restored and modernised. Along with its modern amenities, Teze Bey features a swimming pool and architectural details inspired by Oriental, Russian and Finnish baths.

===== Gum Hamam =====
Gum Hamam was discovered during archaeological excavations underneath the sand; hence the name: Gum hamam (sand bath). It was built sometime during the 12th–14th centuries.

===== Bairamali hamam =====
In ancient times, Bairamali Hamam was called &quot;Bey Hamam&quot;. The original structure was built sometime during the 12th–14th centuries and was reconstructed in 1881.

===== Agha Mikayil Hamam =====
Agha Mikayil Hamam was constructed in the 18th century by Haji Agha Mikayil on Kichik Gala Street in the Old City (Icherisheher). It is still operating in its ancient setting. The Hamam is open to women on Mondays and Fridays and to men on the other days of the week.

==== Modern architecture ====
Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the early 2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as Atlant House were razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells have appeared around the city, the most prominent examples being the International Mugham Center, Azerbaijan Tower, Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre, Flame Towers, Baku Crystal Hall, Baku White City, SOCAR Tower and DENIZ Mall. These projects also caught the attention of international media as notable programmes such as Discovery Channel&#x27;s Extreme Engineering did pieces focusing in on changes to the city.

The Old City of Baku, also known as the Walled City of Baku, refers to the ancient Baku settlement. Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived. This section is picturesque, with its maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings: the cobbled streets past the Palace of the Shirvanshahs, two caravansaries, the baths and the Juma Mosque (which used to house the Azerbaijan National Carpet and Arts Museum but is now a mosque again). The old town core also has dozens of small mosques, often without any particular sign to distinguish them as such.

In 2003, UNESCO placed the Inner City on the List of World Heritage in Danger, citing damage from a November 2000 earthquake, poor conservation as well as &quot;dubious&quot; restoration efforts. In 2009 the Inner City was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger.

Western-style clubs target younger, more energetic crowds. Most of the public houses and bars are located near Fountains Square and are usually open until the early hours of the morning.

=== Parks and gardens ===

Baku has large sections of greenery, either preserved by the National Government or designated as green zones. The city, however, continues to lack a green belt development as economic activity pours into the capital, resulting in massive housing projects along the suburbs.

Baku Boulevard is a pedestrian promenade that runs parallel to Baku&#x27;s seafront. The boulevard contains an amusement park, yacht club, musical fountain, statues and monuments. The park is popular with dog-walkers and joggers and is convenient for tourists. It is adjacent to the newly built International Centre of Mugham and the musical fountain.

<doc id="4567" wikidata="Q178389" url="?curid=4567" title="Balalaika">
<text>The balalaika (, ) is a Russian stringed musical instrument with a characteristic triangular wooden, hollow body, fretted neck, and three strings. Two strings are usually tuned to the same note and the third string is a perfect fourth higher. The higher-pitched balalaikas are used to play melodies and chords. The instrument generally has a short sustain, necessitating rapid strumming or plucking when it is used to play melodies. Balalaikas are often used for Russian folk music and dancing.

The balalaika &quot;family of instruments&quot; includes instruments of various sizes, from the highest-pitched to the lowest: the piccolo balalaika, prima balalaika, secunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass balalaika, and contrabass balalaika. There are balalaika orchestras which consist solely of different balalaikas; these ensembles typically play Classical music that has been arranged for balalaikas. The prima balalaika is the most common; the piccolo is rare. There have also been &quot;descant&quot; and &quot;tenor&quot; balalaikas, but these are considered obsolete. All have three-sided bodies; spruce, evergreen, or fir tops; and backs made of three to nine wooden sections (usually maple).

The prima, secunda, and alto balalaikas are played either with the fingers or a plectrum (pick), depending on the music being played, and the bass and contrabass (equipped with extension legs that rest on the floor) are played with leather plectra. The rare piccolo instrument is usually played with a pick.

== Etymology ==

The earliest mention of the term &quot;balalaika&quot; dates back to a 1688 arrest document. Another appearance of the word is found in a claim dated October 1700 in what is now the Verkhotursky district of Russia. Peter the Great requested balalaika performers to play at the wedding celebrations of N.M. Zotov in Saint Petersburg.

In the Ukrainian language, the word was first documented in the 18th century as &quot;balabaika&quot;; this form is also present in South Russian dialects and the Belarusian language, as well as in Siberian Russia.

It made its way into literature in the 18th century, first appearing in &quot;Elysei&quot;, a 1771 poem by V. Maykov. &quot;Balalaika&quot; also appears in Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, written between 1837 and 1842.

== Types ==


The most common solo instrument is the prima, which is tuned E4–E4–A4 (thus the two lower strings are tuned to the same pitch). Sometimes the balalaika is tuned &quot;guitar style&quot; by folk musicians to G3–B3–D4 (mimicking the three highest strings of the Russian guitar), whereby it is easier to play for Russian guitar players, although classically trained balalaika purists avoid this tuning. It can also be tuned to E4–A4–D5, like its cousin, the domra, to make it easier for those trained on the domra to play the instrument, and still have a balalaika sound. The folk (pre-Andreev) tunings D4–F4–A4 and C4–E4–G4 were very popular, as this makes it easier to play certain riffs.

Balalaikas have been made in the following sizes:


Factory-made six-string prima balalaikas with three sets of double courses are also common. These have three double courses similar to the stringing of the mandolin and often use a &quot;guitar&quot; tuning.

Four-string alto balalaikas are also encountered and are used in the orchestra of the Piatnistky Folk Choir.

The piccolo, prima, and secunda balalaikas were originally strung with gut with the thinnest melody string made of stainless steel. Today, nylon strings are commonly used in place of gut.

Amateur and/or souvenir-style prima balalaikas usually have a total of 16 frets, while in professional orchestra-like ones that number raises to 24.

=== Technique ===

An important part of balalaika technique is the use of the left thumb to fret notes on the lower string, particularly on the prima, where it is used to form chords. Traditionally, the side of the index finger of the right hand is used to sound notes on the prima, while a plectrum is used on the larger sizes.

Because of the large size of the contrabass&#x27;s strings, it is not uncommon to see players using a plectrum made from a leather shoe or boot heel. Bass and contrabass balalaikas rest on the ground, on a wooden or metal pin that is drilled into one of its corners.

== History ==
It is possible that the emergence and evolution of the balalaika was a product of interaction with Asian-Oriental cultures. In addition to European culture, early Russian states, also called Rus&#x27; or Rusi, were also influenced by Oriental-Asian cultures. Some theories say that the instrument is descended from the domra, an instrument from the East Slavs. In the Caucasus, similar instruments such as the Mongolian topshur, used in Kalmykia, and the Panduri used in Georgia are played. It is also similar to the Kazakh dombra, which has two strings. Variants of the dombra played by the Bashkirs often have 3 strings and may represent an instrument related to both the dombra and the balalaika.

=== The pre-Andreyev period ===
Early representations of the balalaika show it with anywhere from two to six strings. Similarly, frets on earlier balalaikas were made of animal gut and tied to the neck so that they could be moved around by the player at will (as is the case with the modern saz, which allows for the playing distinctive to Turkish and Central Asian music).

The first known document mentioning the instrument dates back to 1688. A guard&#x27;s logbook from the Moscow Kremlin records that two commoners were stopped from playing the Balalaika whilst drunk. Further documents from 1700 and 1714 also mention the instrument. In the early 18th century the term appeared in Ukrainian documents, where it sounded like &quot;Balabaika&quot;. Balalaika appeared in &quot;Elysei&quot;, a 1771 poem by V. Maikov. In the 19th century, the balalaika evolved into a triangular instrument with a neck that was substantially shorter than that of its Asian counterparts. It was popular as a village instrument for centuries, particularly with the &quot;skomorokhs&quot;, sort of free-lance musical jesters whose tunes ridiculed the Tsar, the Russian Orthodox Church, and Russian society in general.
=== The Andreyev period ===
In the 1880s, Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev, who was then a professional violinist in the music salons of St Petersburg, developed what became the standardized balalaika, with the assistance of violin maker V. Ivanov. The instrument began to be used in his concert performances. A few years later, St. Petersburg craftsman Paserbsky further refined the instruments by adding a fully chromatic set of frets and also a number of balalaikas in orchestral sizes with the tunings now found in modern instruments. One of the reasons why the instruments were not standardised, was because people in the outlying areas built their own instruments because there was so little communication for them. There were no roads and weather conditions were generally bad. Andreyev patented the design and arranged numerous traditional Russian folk melodies for the orchestra. He also composed a body of concert pieces for the instrument.

== Balalaika orchestra ==
The result of Andreyev&#x27;s labours was the establishment of an orchestral folk tradition in Tsarist Russia, which later grew into a movement within the Soviet Union. The balalaika orchestra in its full form consists of balalaikas, domras, gusli, bayan, Vladimir Shepherd&#x27;s Horns, garmoshkas, and several types of percussion instruments.

With the establishment of the Soviet system and the entrenchment of a proletarian cultural direction, the culture of the working classes (which included that of village labourers) was actively supported by the Soviet establishment. The concept of the balalaika orchestra was adopted wholeheartedly by the Soviet government as something distinctively proletarian (that is, from the working classes) and was also deemed progressive. Significant amounts of energy and time were devoted to support and foster the formal study of the balalaika, from which highly skilled ensemble groups such as the Osipov State Russian Folk Orchestra emerged. Balalaika virtuosi such as Boris Feoktistov and Pavel Necheporenko became stars both inside and outside the Soviet Union. The movement was so powerful that even the renowned Red Army Choir, which initially used a normal symphonic orchestra, changed its instrumentation, replacing violins, violas, and violoncellos with orchestral balalaikas and domras.
== Solo instrument ==
Often musicians perform solo on the balalaika. In particular, Alexey Arkhipovsky is well known for his solo performances. In particular, he was invited to play at the opening ceremony of the second semi final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow because the organizers wanted to give a &quot;more Russian appearance&quot; to the contest.

== In popular culture ==
Through the 20th century, interest in Russian folk instruments grew outside of Russia, likely as a result of western tours by Andreyev and other balalaika virtuosi early in the century. Significant balalaika associations are found in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Seattle.

<doc id="4568" wikidata="Q214855" url="?curid=4568" title="Bank of China Tower (Hong Kong)">
<text>The Bank of China Tower (BOC Tower) is a skyscraper located in Central, Hong Kong. Located at 1 Garden Road on Hong Kong Island, the tower houses the headquarters of the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited. One of the most recognisable landmarks in Hong Kong, the building is notable for its distinct shape and design, consisting of triangular frameworks covered by glass curtain walls.

The building was designed by Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei and L. C. Pei of I. M. Pei and Partners. At a height of , reaching high including a spire, the building is the fourth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, after International Commerce Centre, Two International Finance Centre (2 IFC) and Central Plaza. It was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1990 to 1992, and it was the first supertall skyscraper outside the United States, the first to break the 305 m (1,000 ft) mark. It was surpassed by Central Plaza on the same island in 1992.

Construction began on 18 April 1985 on the former site of Murray House, and was completed five years later in 1990. Sporting a steel-column design, the building is accessible from the MTR&#x27;s Central station. The building lies between Cotton Tree Drive and Garden Road.

==History==
===Site===
The site on which the building is constructed was formerly the location of Murray House. After its brick-by-brick relocation to Stanley, the site was sold by the Government for &quot;only HK$1 billion&quot; in August 1982 amidst growing concern over the future of Hong Kong in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty.

The building was initially built by the Hong Kong Branch of the Bank of China; its Garden Road entrance continues to display the name &quot;Bank of China&quot;, rather than BOCHK. The top four and the bottom 19 stories are used by the Bank, while the other floors are leased out. Ownership has since been transferred to BOCHK, although the Bank of China has leased back several floors for use by its own operations in Hong Kong.

===Favouritism controversy===
The Government had apparently given preferential treatment to Chinese companies, and was again criticised for the apparent preferential treatment to the BOCHK.

The price paid was half the amount of the Admiralty II plot, for which the MTR Corporation paid HK$1.82 billion in cash. The BOC would make initial payment of $60 million, with the rest payable over 13 years at 6% interest. The announcement of the sale was also poorly handled, and a dive in business confidence ensued. The Hang Seng Index fell 80 points, and the HK$ lost 1.5% of its value the next day.

=== Construction ===
The tower was built by Japanese contractor Kumagai Gumi. Superstructure work began in May 1986. The tower is a steel-frame structure.

The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 interrupted publicity surrounding the building&#x27;s design and construction. A press conference scheduled for 24 May 1989, two weeks before the incident, was intended to show off the building&#x27;s &quot;designer socialist furnishings&quot;, but was called off as the student demonstrations in Beijing escalated. The public relations firm that organised the conference explained to the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; that &quot;under the circumstances, it has been decided to stop any publicity to do with the Bank of China.&quot;

Once developed, gross floor area was expected to be . The original project was intended for completion on the auspicious date of 8 August 1988. However, owing to project delays, groundbreaking took place in March 1985, almost two years late, with the completion also facing a nearly two-year delay. It was topped out in 1989, and occupied on 15 June 1990.

==Architecture ==
Designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect I. M. Pei, the building is high with two masts reaching high. The 72-storey building is located near Central MTR station. This was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1990 to 1992, the first building outside the United States to break the 305 m (1,000 ft) mark, and the first composite space frame high-rise building. That also means it was the tallest outside the United States from its completion year, 1990. It is now the fourth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, after International Commerce Centre, Two International Finance Centre and Central Plaza.

A small observation deck on the 43rd floor of the building was once open to the public, but is now closed.

The whole structure is supported by the four steel columns at the corners of the building, with the triangular frameworks transferring the weight of the structure onto these four columns. It is covered with glass curtain walls. Structural engineer Leslie E. Robertson, best known for his work on the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center, provided the structural engineering design, while Jaros, Baum &amp; Bolles was the mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineer.

While its distinctive look makes it one of Hong Kong&#x27;s most identifiable landmarks today, it was the source of some controversy at one time, as the bank is the only major building in Hong Kong to have bypassed the convention of consulting with feng shui masters on matters of design prior to construction.

The building has been criticised by some practitioners of feng shui for its sharp edges and its negative symbolism by the numerous &#x27;X&#x27; shapes in its original design, though Pei modified the design to some degree before construction following this feedback. The building&#x27;s profile from some angles resembles that of a meat cleaver and it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;vertical knife&quot;. This earned it the nickname () in Cantonese, literally meaning &#x27;one knife&#x27;.

<text>Lemon Henry &quot;Blind Lemon&quot; Jefferson (September 24, 1893 – December 19, 1929) was an American blues and gospel singer-songwriter and musician. He was one of the most popular and successful blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the &quot;Father of the Texas Blues&quot;.

Due mainly to his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing, Jefferson&#x27;s performances were distinctive. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists. Later blues and rock and roll musicians, however, did attempt to imitate both his songs and his musical style.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jefferson was born blind, near Coutchman, Texas. He was the youngest of seven (or possibly eight) children born to Clarissa and Alex Jefferson, who were African-American sharecroppers. Disputes regarding the date of his birth derive from the fact that census records and his draft registration show different dates. By 1900, the family was farming southeast of Streetman, Texas. Jefferson&#x27;s birth date was recorded as September 1893 in the 1900 census. The 1910 census, taken in May, before his birthday, confirms his year of birth as 1893 and indicated that the family was farming northwest of Wortham, near his birthplace.

In his 1917 draft registration, Jefferson gave his birthday as October 26, 1894, stating that he lived in Dallas, Texas, and had been blind since birth. In the 1920 census, he is recorded as having returned to Freestone County and was living with his half-brother, Kit Banks, on a farm between Wortham and Streetman.

Jefferson began playing the guitar in his early teens and soon after he began performing at picnics and parties. He became a street musician, playing in East Texas towns in front of barbershops and on street corners. According to his cousin Alec Jefferson, quoted in the notes for the compilation album &quot;The Complete 94 Classic Sides: Remastered&quot;:

One of Jefferson&#x27;s first appearances was at the General Association of Baptist Churches in Buffalo, Texas. There he would perform classic gospel music which would later lead to his first album release in 1926 containing two hit gospel songs,  &quot;I Want to Be Like Jesus in My Heart&quot; and &quot;All I Want Is That Pure Religion&quot;. According to his friend, the folk musician Lead Belly, in 1917, Jefferson was commonly found on the corner of Elm and Central Tracks in a part of Dallas called Deep Ellum. Jefferson was restricted in many parts of Dallas by the white population, leaving his only option to play the African-American neighborhood that made up Deep Ellum.

In 1912, Jefferson began traveling frequently to Dallas, where he played with Lead Belly. Jefferson was one of the earliest and most prominent figures in the blues movement developing in Deep Ellum. It is probable that he moved to Deep Ellum on a more permanent basis by 1917, where he met Aaron Thibeaux Walker, also known as T-Bone Walker. Jefferson taught Walker the basics of playing blues guitar in exchange for Walker&#x27;s occasional services as a guide. By the early 1920s, Jefferson was earning enough money for his musical performances to support a wife and, possibly, a child. However, firm evidence of his marriage and children has not been found.

===Beginning of recording career===
Prior to Jefferson, few artists had recorded solo voice and blues guitar, the first of which were the vocalist Sara Martin and the guitarist Sylvester Weaver, who recorded &quot;Longing for Daddy Blues&quot;, probably on October 24, 1923. The first self-accompanied solo performer of a self-composed blues song was Lee Morse, whose &quot;Mail Man Blues&quot; was recorded on October 7, 1924. Jefferson&#x27;s music is uninhibited and represented the classic sounds of everyday life, from a honky-tonk to a country picnic, to street corner blues, to work in the burgeoning oil fields (a reflection of his interest in mechanical objects and processes).

Jefferson did what few had ever done before him – he became a successful solo guitarist and male vocalist in the commercial recording world. Unlike many artists who were &quot;discovered&quot; and recorded in their normal venues, Jefferson was taken to Chicago in December 1925 or January 1926 to record his first tracks. Uncharacteristically for him, the first two recordings on this session were gospel songs (&quot;I Want to Be Like Jesus in My Heart&quot; and &quot;All I Want Is That Pure Religion&quot;), and they were released under the name Deacon L. J. Bates. A second recording session was held in March 1926. His first releases under his own name, &quot;Booster Blues&quot; and &quot;Dry Southern Blues&quot;, were hits. Their popularity led to the release of the other two songs from that session, &quot;Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Long Lonesome Blues&quot;, which became a runaway success, with sales in six figures. He recorded about a hundred tracks between 1926 and 1929; forty-three records were issued, all but one of them on Paramount Records. Almost all of his recordings for Paramount had poor sound quality because Paramount&#x27;s studio techniques and production were poor during that time. In May 1926, Paramount re-recorded Jefferson performing his hits &quot;Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Long Lonesome Blues&quot; in the superior facilities at Marsh Laboratories, and their subsequent releases used these newer versions. Both the original and re-recorded versions appear on modern compilation albums.

===Success with Paramount Records===

Largely because of the popularity of artists such as Jefferson and his contemporaries Blind Blake and Ma Rainey, Paramount became the leading recording company for the blues in the 1920s. Jefferson&#x27;s earnings reputedly enabled him to buy a car and employ chauffeurs (this information has been disputed); he was given a Ford car &quot;worth over $700&quot; by Mayo Williams, Paramount&#x27;s connection with the black community. This was a common compensation for recording rights in that market. Jefferson is known to have done an unusual amount of traveling for the time in the American South, which is reflected in the difficulty of placing his music in a single regional category.

Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;old-fashioned&quot; sound and confident musicianship made it easy to market him. His skillful guitar playing and impressive vocal range opened the door for a new generation of male solo blues performers, such as Furry Lewis, Charlie Patton, and Barbecue Bob. He stuck to no musical conventions, varying his riffs and rhythm and singing complex and expressive lyrics in a manner exceptional at the time for a &quot;simple country blues singer.&quot; According to the North Carolina musician Walter Davis, Jefferson played on the streets in Johnson City, Tennessee, during the early 1920s, at which time Davis and the entertainer Clarence Greene learned the art of blues guitar.

Jefferson was reputedly unhappy with his royalties (although Williams said that Jefferson had a bank account containing as much as $1,500). In 1927, when Williams moved to Okeh Records, he took Jefferson with him, and Okeh quickly recorded and released Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Matchbox Blues&quot;, backed with &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot;. It was his only Okeh recording, probably because of contractual obligations with Paramount. Jefferson&#x27;s two songs released on Okeh have considerably better sound quality than his Paramount records at the time. When he returned to Paramount a few months later, &quot;Matchbox Blues&quot; had already become such a hit that Paramount re-recorded and released two new versions, with the producer Arthur Laibly. In 1927, Jefferson recorded another of his classic songs, the haunting &quot;See That My Grave Is Kept Clean&quot; (again using the pseudonym Deacon L. J. Bates), and two other uncharacteristically spiritual songs, &quot;He Arose from the Dead&quot; and &quot;Where Shall I Be&quot;. &quot;See That My Grave Is Kept Clean&quot; was so successful that it was re-recorded and re-released in 1928.

===Death and grave===

Jefferson died in Chicago at 10:00 a.m. on December 19, 1929, of what his death certificate said was &quot;probably acute myocarditis&quot;. For many years, rumors circulated that a jealous lover had poisoned his coffee, but a more likely explanation is that he died of a heart attack after becoming disoriented during a snowstorm. Some have said that he died of a heart attack after being attacked by a dog in the middle of the night. In his 1983 book &quot;Tolbert&#x27;s Texas&quot;, Frank X. Tolbert claims that he was killed while being robbed of a large royalty payment by a guide escorting him to Chicago Union Station to catch a train home to Texas. Paramount Records paid for the return of his body to Texas by train, accompanied by the pianist William Ezell.

Jefferson was buried at Wortham Negro Cemetery (later Wortham Black Cemetery) in Wortham, Freestone County, Texas. His grave was unmarked until 1967, when a Texas historical marker was erected in the general area of his plot; however, the precise location of the grave is still unknown. By 1996, the cemetery and marker were in poor condition, and a new granite headstone was erected in 1997. The inscription reads: &quot;Lord, it&#x27;s one kind favor I&#x27;ll ask of you, see that my grave is kept clean.&quot; In 2007, the cemetery&#x27;s name was changed to Blind Lemon Memorial Cemetery, and his gravesite is kept clean by a cemetery committee in Wortham.

==Discography and awards==

Jefferson had an intricate and fast style of guitar playing and a particularly high-pitched voice. He was a founder of the Texas blues sound and an important influence on other blues singers and guitarists, including Lead Belly and Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins.

He was the author of many songs covered by later musicians, including the classic &quot;See That My Grave Is Kept Clean&quot;. Another of his songs, &quot;Matchbox Blues&quot;, was recorded more than 30 years later by the Beatles, in a rockabilly version credited to Carl Perkins, who did not credit Jefferson on his 1955 recording. Fellow blues artist B.B. King credited Jefferson as one of his biggest musical influences, next to Lonnie Johnson, Louis Jordan and T-Bone Walker.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame selected Jefferson&#x27;s 1927 recording of &quot;Matchbox Blues&quot; as one of the 500 songs that shaped rock and roll. Jefferson was among the inaugural class of blues musicians inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980.

* Geoff Muldaur refers to Jefferson in the song &quot;Got to Find Blind Lemon&quot; on the album &quot;The Secret Handshake&quot;.
* Art Evans portrayed Jefferson in the 1976 film &quot;Leadbelly&quot;, directed by Gordon Parks.
* Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds recorded the song &quot;Blind Lemon Jefferson&quot; on the album &quot;The Firstborn Is Dead&quot;.
* The 2010 video game &quot;&quot;, in one of its downloadable add-ons &quot;Old World Blues&quot;, features an AI jukebox named Blind Diode Jefferson. The AI claims to have been a blues musician before his music hard drives were stripped from him. The voicing of the AI can be characterized as a Southern drawl in homage to Jefferson.
* In the 2003 movie &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot;, Bobby Cupid (Luke Wilson) gives his friend Jack Fate (Bob Dylan) Jefferson&#x27;s guitar, which he claims was used in recording &quot;Matchbox Blues&quot;.
* Cheech &amp; Chong parodied Jefferson as &quot;Blind Melon Chitlin&#x27;&quot; on their self-titled 1971 album &quot;Cheech and Chong&quot;, on their 1985 album &quot;Get Out of My Room&quot;, and in a stage routine that can be seen in their 1983 film &quot;Still Smokin&#x27;&quot;.
* Chet Atkins called Jefferson &quot;one of my first finger-picking influences&quot; in the song &quot;Nine Pound Hammer&quot;, on the album &quot;The Atkins–Travis Traveling Show&quot;.

References to the nonexistent Adams appeared in subsequent articles in &quot;Down Beat&quot; over the next few years.
* The American dramatic film &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot; was named after one of the only songs Jefferson recorded for Okeh Records.
* Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup took the title of his classic song &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; (which launched the career of Elvis Presley) from a lyric in Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot;.
* According to some sources, the &quot;Jefferson&quot; in the name of the rock group Jefferson Airplane came from &quot;Blind Lemon Jefferson Airplane&quot;, a friend&#x27;s nickname for founding member and blues guitarist Jorma Kaukonen.

<text>are Japanese supernatural beings that are said to devour nightmares. They originate from the Chinese Mo. According to legend, they were created by the spare pieces that were left over when the gods finished creating all other animals. They have a long history in Japanese folklore and art, and more recently have appeared in manga and anime.

The Japanese term &quot;baku&quot; has two current meanings, referring to both the traditional dream-devouring creature and to the Malayan tapir. In recent years, there have been changes in how the &quot;baku&quot; is depicted.

==History and description==
The traditional Japanese nightmare-devouring &quot;baku&quot; originates in Chinese folklore from the &quot;mo&quot; 貘 (giant panda) and was familiar in Japan as early as the Muromachi period (14th–15th century). Hori Tadao has described the dream-eating abilities attributed to the traditional &quot;baku&quot; and relates them to other preventatives against nightmare such as amulets. Kaii-Yōkai Denshō Database, citing a 1957 paper, and Mizuki also describe the dream-devouring capacities of the traditional &quot;baku&quot;.

Before its adaptation to the Japanese dream-caretaker myth creature, an early 17th-century Japanese manuscript, the &quot;Sankai Ibutsu&quot; (), describes the &quot;baku&quot; as a shy, Chinese mythical chimera with the trunk and tusks of an elephant, the ears of a rhinoceros, the tail of a cow, the body of a bear and the paws of a tiger, which protected against pestilence and evil, although eating nightmares was not included among its abilities. However, in a 1791 Japanese wood-block illustration, a specifically dream-destroying &quot;baku&quot; is depicted with an elephant&#x27;s head, tusks, and trunk, with horns and tiger&#x27;s claws. The elephant&#x27;s head, trunk, and tusks are characteristic of &quot;baku&quot; portrayed in classical era (pre-Meiji) Japanese wood-block prints (see illustration) and in shrine, temple, and netsuke carvings.

Writing in the Meiji period, Lafcadio Hearn (1902) described a &quot;baku&quot; with very similar attributes that was also able to devour nightmares.
Legend has it that a person who wakes up from a bad dream can call out to &quot;baku&quot;. A child having a nightmare in Japan will wake up and repeat three times, &quot;Baku-san, come eat my dream.&quot; Legends say that the &quot;baku&quot; will come into the child&#x27;s room and devour the bad dream, allowing the child to go back to sleep peacefully. However, calling to the &quot;baku&quot; must be done sparingly, because if he remains hungry after eating one&#x27;s nightmare, he may also devour their hopes and desires as well, leaving them to live an empty life. The &quot;baku&quot; can also be summoned for protection from bad dreams prior to falling asleep at night. In the 1910s, it was common for Japanese children to keep a &quot;baku&quot; talisman at their bedside.

<text>Edward Teach (or Thatch; – 22 November 1718), better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate who operated around the West Indies and the eastern coast of Britain&#x27;s North American colonies. Little is known about his early life, but he may have been a sailor on privateer ships during Queen Anne&#x27;s War before he settled on the Bahamian island of New Providence, a base for Captain Benjamin Hornigold, whose crew Teach joined around 1716. Hornigold placed him in command of a sloop that he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by Stede Bonnet, but Hornigold retired from piracy toward the end of 1717, taking two vessels with him.

Teach captured a French slave ship known as , renamed her &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge,&quot; equipped her with 40 guns, and crewed her with over 300 men. He became a renowned pirate. His nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance. He was reported to have tied lit fuses (slow matches) under his hat to frighten his enemies. He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, ransoming the port&#x27;s inhabitants. He then ran &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; aground on a sandbar near Beaufort, North Carolina. He parted company with Stede Bonnet and settled in Bath, North Carolina, also known as Bath Town, where he accepted a royal pardon. However, he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of Alexander Spotswood, the governor of Virginia. Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to capture him. On 22 November 1718, following a ferocious battle, Teach and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard.

Teach was a shrewd and calculating leader who spurned the use of violence, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response that he desired from those whom he robbed. He was romanticised after his death and became the inspiration for an archetypal pirate in works of fiction across many genres.

==Early life==
Little is known about Blackbeard&#x27;s early life. It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40 years old and thus born around 1680. In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch or Edward Teach. The latter is most often used because it is the form used in the dispatches of North America&#x27;s only newspaper at the time, the Boston News-Letter, but primary sources written by people who had actually met the pirate all refer to him as &quot;Thatch&quot; or variations thereof. Several spellings of his surname exist: Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche, and Theach. One source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely. Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in piracy so as not to tarnish the family name, which makes it unlikely that Teach&#x27;s real name will ever be known.

The 17th-century rise of Britain&#x27;s American colonies and the rapid 18th-century expansion of the Atlantic slave trade had made Bristol an important international sea port, and Teach was most likely raised in what was then the second-largest city in England. He could almost certainly read and write. He communicated with merchants and, upon his death, had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the Province of Carolina, Tobias Knight. Author Robert Lee speculated that Teach may therefore have been born into a respectable, wealthy family. He may have arrived in the Caribbean in the last years of the 17th century, on a merchant vessel (possibly a slave ship). The 18th-century author Charles Johnson claimed that Teach was for some time a sailor operating from Jamaica on privateer ships during the War of the Spanish Succession, and that &quot;he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage.&quot; It is unknown at what point during the war Teach joined the fighting, as with the record of most of his life before he became a pirate.

==Life as a pirate==
===New Providence===
With its history of colonialism, trade and piracy, the West Indies was the setting for many 17th- and 18th-century maritime incidents. The privateer-turned-pirate Henry Jennings and his followers decided, early in the 18th century, to use the uninhabited island of New Providence as a base for their operations since it was within easy reach of the Florida Strait and its busy shipping lanes, which were filled with European vessels crossing the Atlantic. New Providence&#x27;s harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships but was too shallow for the Royal Navy&#x27;s larger vessels. The author George Woodbury described New Providence as &quot;no city of homes. It was a place of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population,&quot; continuing, &quot;The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on. All others were transient.&quot; In New Providence, pirates found a welcome respite from the law.

Teach was one of those who came to enjoy the island&#x27;s benefits. Probably shortly after the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, he moved there from Jamaica, and, along with most privateers once involved in the war, became involved in piracy. Possibly about 1716, he joined the crew of Captain Benjamin Hornigold, a renowned pirate who operated from New Providence&#x27;s safe waters. In 1716, Hornigold placed Teach in charge of a sloop he had taken as a prize. In early 1717, Hornigold and Teach, each captaining a sloop, set out for the mainland. They captured a boat carrying 120 barrels of flour out of Havana, and shortly thereafter took 100 barrels of wine from a sloop out of Bermuda. A few days later they stopped a vessel sailing from Madeira to Charles Town, South Carolina. Teach and his quartermaster, William Howard, may at this time have struggled to control their crews. By then they had probably developed a taste for Madeira wine, and on 29 September near Cape Charles all they took from the &quot;Betty&quot; of Virginia was her cargo of Madeira, before they scuttled her with the remaining cargo.

It was during this cruise with Hornigold that the earliest known report of Teach was made, in which he is recorded as a pirate in his own right, in command of a large crew. In a report made by a Captain Mathew Munthe on an anti-piracy patrol for North Carolina, &quot;Thatch&quot; was described as operating &quot;a sloop 6 and about 70 men.&quot; In September, Teach and Hornigold encountered Stede Bonnet, a landowner and military officer from a wealthy family who had turned to piracy earlier that year. Bonnet&#x27;s crew of about 70 were reportedly dissatisfied with his command, so with Bonnet&#x27;s permission, Teach took control of his ship, &quot;Revenge.&quot; The pirates&#x27; flotilla now consisted of three ships: Teach on &quot;Revenge,&quot; Teach&#x27;s old sloop, and Hornigold&#x27;s &quot;Ranger.&quot; By October, another vessel had been captured and added to the small fleet. The sloops &quot;Robert&quot; of Philadelphia and &quot;Good Intent&quot; of Dublin were stopped on 22 October 1717 and their cargo holds emptied.

As a former British privateer, Hornigold attacked only his old enemies, but for his crew, the sight of British vessels filled with valuable cargo passing by unharmed became too much, and at some point toward the end of 1717 he was demoted. Whether Teach had any involvement in this decision is unknown, but Hornigold quickly retired from piracy. He took &quot;Ranger&quot; and one of the sloops, leaving Teach with &quot;Revenge&quot; and the remaining sloop. The two never met again and, as did many other occupants of New Providence, Hornigold accepted the King&#x27;s pardon.

===Blackbeard===

On 28 November 1717 Teach&#x27;s two ships attacked a French merchant vessel off the coast of Saint Vincent. They each fired a broadside across its bulwarks, killing several of its crew, and forcing its captain to surrender. The ship was , a large French Guineaman registered in Saint-Malo and carrying a cargo of slaves. This ship had originally been the English merchantman &quot;Concord&quot;, captured in 1711 by a French squadron, and then changed hands several times by 1717. Teach and his crews sailed the vessel south along Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to Bequia, where they disembarked her crew and cargo, and converted the ship for their own use. The crew of were given the smaller of Teach&#x27;s two sloops, which they renamed (&quot;Bad Meeting&quot;), and sailed for Martinique. Teach may have recruited some of their slaves, but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of .

Teach immediately renamed as &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and equipped her with 40 guns. By this time Teach had placed his lieutenant Richards in command of Bonnet&#x27;s &quot;Revenge&quot;. In late November the same year, near Saint Vincent, he attacked the &quot;Great Allen&quot;. After a lengthy engagement, he forced the large and well-armed merchant ship to surrender. He ordered her to move closer to the shore, disembarked her crew and emptied her cargo holds, and then burned and sank the vessel. The incident was chronicled in the &quot;Boston News-Letter&quot;, which called Teach the commander of a &quot;French ship of 32 Guns, a Briganteen of 10 guns and a Sloop of 12 guns.&quot; It is not known when or where Teach collected the ten-gun briganteen, but by that time he may have been in command of at least 150 men split among three vessels.

On 5 December 1717 Teach stopped the merchant sloop &quot;Margaret&quot; off the coast of Crab Island, near Anguilla. Her captain, Henry Bostock, and crew, remained Teach&#x27;s prisoners for about eight hours, and were forced to watch as their sloop was ransacked. Bostock, who had been held aboard &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, was returned unharmed to &quot;Margaret&quot; and was allowed to leave with his crew. He returned to his base of operations on Saint Christopher Island and reported the matter to Governor Walter Hamilton, who requested that he sign an affidavit about the encounter. Bostock&#x27;s deposition details Teach&#x27;s command of two vessels: a sloop and a large French guineaman, Dutch-built, with 36 cannons and a crew of 300 men. The captain believed that the larger ship carried valuable gold dust, silver plate, and &quot;a very fine cup&quot; supposedly taken from the commander of &quot;Great Allen&quot;. Teach&#x27;s crew had apparently informed Bostock that they had destroyed several other vessels, and that they intended to sail to Hispaniola and lie in wait for an expected Spanish armada, supposedly laden with money to pay the garrisons. Bostock also claimed that Teach had questioned him about the movements of local ships, but also that he had seemed unsurprised when Bostock told him of an expected royal pardon from London for all pirates.

Bostock&#x27;s deposition describes Teach as a &quot;tall spare man with a very black beard which he wore very long&quot;. It is the first recorded account of Teach&#x27;s appearance and is the source of his nickname Blackbeard. Later descriptions mention that his thick black beard was braided into pigtails, sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons. Johnson (1724) described him as &quot;such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful.&quot; Whether Johnson&#x27;s description was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear, but it seems likely that Teach understood the value of appearances; better to strike fear into the heart of one&#x27;s enemies than rely on bluster alone. Teach was tall, with broad shoulders. He wore knee-length boots and dark clothing, topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly coloured silk or velvet. Johnson also described Teach in times of battle as wearing &quot;a sling over his shoulders, with three brace of pistols, hanging in holsters like bandoliers; and stuck lighted slow matches under his hat&quot;, the latter apparently to emphasise the fearsome appearance he wished to present to his enemies. Despite his ferocious reputation, there are no verified accounts of his ever having murdered or harmed those he held captive. Teach may have used other aliases; on 30 November, the &quot;Monserrat Merchant&quot; encountered two ships and a sloop, commanded by a Captain Kentish and Captain Edwards (the latter a known alias of Stede Bonnet).

===Enlargement of Teach&#x27;s fleet===
Teach&#x27;s movements between late 1717 and early 1718 are not known. He and Bonnet were probably responsible for an attack off Sint Eustatius in December 1717. Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would head toward the Spanish-controlled Samaná Bay in Hispaniola, but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity. Captain Hume of reported on 6 February that a &quot;Pyrate Ship of 36 Guns and 250 men, and a Sloop of 10 Guns and 100 men were Said to be Cruizing amongst the Leeward Islands&quot;. Hume reinforced his crew with soldiers armed with muskets, and joined up with to track the two ships, to no avail, though they discovered that the two ships had sunk a French vessel off St Christopher Island, and reported also that they had last been seen &quot;gone down the North side of Hispaniola&quot;. Although no confirmation exists that these two ships were controlled by Teach and Bonnet, author Angus Konstam believes it very likely they were.
In March 1718, while taking on water at Turneffe Island east of Belize, both ships spotted the Jamaican logwood-cutting sloop &quot;Adventure&quot; making for the harbour. She was stopped and her captain, Harriot, invited to join the pirates. Harriot and his crew accepted the invitation, and Teach sent over a crew to sail &quot;Adventure&quot; making Israel Hands the captain. They sailed for the Bay of Honduras, where they added another ship and four sloops to their flotilla. On 9 April Teach&#x27;s enlarged fleet of ships looted and burnt &quot;Protestant Caesar&quot;. His fleet then sailed to Grand Cayman where they captured a &quot;small turtler&quot;. Teach probably sailed toward Havana, where he may have captured a small Spanish vessel that had left the Cuban port. They then sailed to the wrecks of the 1715 Spanish fleet, off the eastern coast of Florida. There Teach disembarked the crew of the captured Spanish sloop, before proceeding north to the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, attacking three vessels along the way.

===Blockade of Charles Town===
By May 1718, Teach had awarded himself the rank of Commodore and was at the height of his power. Late that month his flotilla blockaded the port of Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina. All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped, and as the town had no guard ship, its pilot boat was the first to be captured. Over the next five or six days about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past Charles Town Bar, where Teach&#x27;s fleet was anchored. One such ship, headed for London with a group of prominent Charles Town citizens which included Samuel Wragg (a member of the Council of the province of Carolina), was the &quot;Crowley&quot;. Her passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day. Teach informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina, and that if none were forthcoming, all prisoners would be executed, their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt.

Wragg agreed to Teach&#x27;s demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given two days to collect the drugs. Teach moved his fleet, and the captured ships, to within about five or six leagues from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks&#x27;s boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates&#x27; demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.

Teach kept to his side of the bargain and released the captured ships and his prisoners—albeit relieved of their valuables, including the fine clothing some had worn.

===Beaufort Inlet===
Whilst at Charles Town, Teach learned that Woodes Rogers had left England with several men-of-war, with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates. Teach&#x27;s flotilla sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into Topsail Inlet (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), off the coast of North Carolina. There they intended to careen their ships to scrape their hulls, but on 10 June 1718 the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her main-mast and severely damaging many of her timbers. Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her. A sloop commanded by Israel Hands of &quot;Adventure&quot; also ran aground, and both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair, leaving only &quot;Revenge&quot; and the captured Spanish sloop.

===Pardon===

Teach had at some stage learnt of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it. The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5 September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5 January. Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach at risk of being hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions. Teach thought that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited to see what would happen to another captain. Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon. He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the &quot;Revenge&quot; and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to Saint Thomas Island to receive a commission. Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him. He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27 September 1718 at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town.

The author Robert Lee surmised that Teach and Hands intentionally ran the ships aground to reduce the fleet&#x27;s crew complement, increasing their share of the spoils. During the trial of Bonnet&#x27;s crew, &quot;Revenge&quot;″s boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that &quot;the ship was run ashore and lost, which Thatch [Teach] caused to be done.&quot; Lee considers it plausible that Teach let Bonnet in on his plan to accept a pardon from Governor Eden. He suggested that Bonnet do the same, and as war between the Quadruple Alliance of 1718 and Spain was threatening, to consider taking a privateer&#x27;s commission from England. Lee suggests that Teach also offered Bonnet the return of his ship &quot;Revenge&quot;. Konstam (2007) proposes a similar idea, explaining that Teach began to see &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; as something of a liability; while a pirate fleet was anchored, news of this was sent to neighbouring towns and colonies, and any vessels nearby would delay sailing. It was prudent therefore for Teach not to linger for too long, although wrecking the ship was an extreme measure.
Before sailing northward on his remaining sloop to Ocracoke Inlet, Teach marooned about 25 men on a small sandy island about 5 km from the mainland. He may have done this to stifle any protest they made, if they guessed their captain&#x27;s plans. Bonnet rescued them two days later. Teach continued on to Bath, where in June 1718—only days after Bonnet had departed with his pardon—he and his much-reduced crew received their pardon from Governor Eden.

He settled in Bath, on the eastern side of Bath Creek at Plum Point, near Eden&#x27;s home. During July and August he travelled between his base in the town and his sloop off Ocracoke. Johnson&#x27;s account states that he married the daughter of a local plantation owner, although there is no supporting evidence for this. Eden gave Teach permission to sail to St Thomas to seek a commission as a privateer (a useful way of removing bored and troublesome pirates from the small settlement), and Teach was given official title to his remaining sloop, which he renamed &quot;Adventure&quot;. By the end of August he had returned to piracy, and in the same month the governor of Pennsylvania issued a warrant for his arrest, but by then Teach was probably operating in Delaware Bay, some distance away. He took two French ships leaving the Caribbean, moved one crew across to the other, and sailed the remaining ship back to Ocracoke. In September he told Eden that he had found the French ship at sea, deserted. A Vice Admiralty Court was quickly convened, presided over by Tobias Knight and the Collector of Customs. The ship was judged as a derelict found at sea, and of its cargo twenty hogsheads of sugar were awarded to Knight and sixty to Eden; Teach and his crew were given what remained in the vessel&#x27;s hold.

Ocracoke Inlet was Teach&#x27;s favourite anchorage. It was a perfect vantage point from which to view ships travelling between the various settlements of northeast Carolina, and it was from there that Teach first spotted the approaching ship of Charles Vane, another English pirate. Several months earlier Vane had rejected the pardon brought by Woodes Rogers and escaped the men-of-war the English captain brought with him to Nassau. He had also been pursued by Teach&#x27;s old commander, Benjamin Hornigold, who was by then a pirate hunter. Teach and Vane spent several nights on the southern tip of Ocracoke Island, accompanied by such notorious figures as Israel Hands, Robert Deal and Calico Jack.

===Alexander Spotswood===
As it spread throughout the neighbouring colonies, the news of Teach and Vane&#x27;s impromptu party worried the governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates. They were unsuccessful, but Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina. Some of Teach&#x27;s former crew had already moved into several Virginian seaport towns, prompting Spotswood to issue a proclamation on 10 July, requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities, to give up their arms and to not travel in groups larger than three. As head of a Crown colony, Spotswood viewed the proprietary colony of North Carolina with contempt; he had little faith in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates, who he suspected would be back to their old ways, disrupting Virginian commerce, as soon as their money ran out.

Spotswood learned that William Howard, the former quartermaster of &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, was in the area, and believing that he might know of Teach&#x27;s whereabouts had him and his two slaves arrested. Spotswood had no legal authority to have pirates tried, and as a result, Howard&#x27;s attorney, John Holloway, brought charges against Captain Brand of , where Howard was imprisoned. He also sued on Howard&#x27;s behalf for damages of £500, claiming wrongful arrest.

Spotswood&#x27;s council claimed that under a statute of William III the governor was entitled to try pirates without a jury in times of crisis and that Teach&#x27;s presence was a crisis. The charges against Howard referred to several acts of piracy supposedly committed after the pardon&#x27;s cut-off date, in &quot;a sloop belonging to ye subjects of the King of Spain&quot;, but ignored the fact that they took place outside Spotswood&#x27;s jurisdiction and in a vessel then legally owned. Another charge cited two attacks, one of which was the capture of a slave ship off Charles Town Bar, from which one of Howard&#x27;s slaves was presumed to have come. Howard was sent to await trial before a Court of Vice-Admiralty, on the charge of piracy, but Brand and his colleague, Captain Gordon (of ) refused to serve with Holloway present. Incensed, Holloway had no option but to stand down, and was replaced by the Attorney General of Virginia, John Clayton, whom Spotswood described as &quot;an honester man [than Holloway]&quot;. Howard was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged, but was saved by a commission from London, which directed Spotswood to pardon all acts of piracy committed by surrendering pirates before 18 August 1718.

Spotswood had obtained from Howard valuable information on Teach&#x27;s whereabouts, and he planned to send his forces across the border into North Carolina to capture him. He gained the support of two men keen to discredit North Carolina&#x27;s governor—Edward Moseley and Colonel Maurice Moore. He also wrote to the Lords of Trade, suggesting that the Crown might benefit financially from Teach&#x27;s capture. Spotswood personally financed the operation, possibly believing that Teach had fabulous treasures hidden away. He ordered Captains Gordon and Brand of HMS &quot;Pearl&quot; and HMS &quot;Lyme&quot; to travel overland to Bath. Lieutenant Robert Maynard of HMS &quot;Pearl&quot; was given command of two commandeered sloops, to approach the town from the sea. An extra incentive for Teach&#x27;s capture was the offer of a reward from the Assembly of Virginia, over and above any that might be received from the Crown.

Maynard took command of the two armed sloops on 17 November. He was given 57 men—33 from HMS &quot;Pearl&quot; and 24 from HMS &quot;Lyme&quot;. Maynard and the detachment from HMS &quot;Pearl&quot; took the larger of the two vessels and named her &quot;Jane&quot;; the rest took &quot;Ranger&quot;, commanded by one of Maynard&#x27;s officers, a Mister Hyde. Some from the two ships&#x27; civilian crews remained aboard. They sailed from Kecoughtan, along the James River, on 17 November. The two sloops moved slowly, giving Brand&#x27;s force time to reach Bath. Brand set out for North Carolina six days later, arriving within three miles of Bath on 23 November. Included in Brand&#x27;s force were several North Carolinians, including Colonel Moore and Captain Jeremiah Vail, sent to counter any local objection to the presence of foreign soldiers. Moore went into the town to see if Teach was there, reporting back that he was not, but that he was expected at &quot;every minute.&quot; Brand then went to Governor Eden&#x27;s home and informed him of his purpose. The next day, Brand sent two canoes down Pamlico River to Ocracoke Inlet, to see if Teach could be seen. They returned two days later and reported on what eventually transpired.

===Last battle===
Maynard found the pirates anchored on the inner side of Ocracoke Island, on the evening of 21 November. He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but being unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack. He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet—preventing any warning of his presence—and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that Teach could not escape to sea. On the other side of the island, Teach was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout. With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about 24 of &quot;Adventure&quot;″s sailors, he also had a much-reduced crew. Johnson (1724) reported Teach had &quot;no more than twenty-five men on board&quot; and that he &quot;gave out to all the vessels that he spoke with that he had forty&quot;. &quot;Thirteen white and six Negroes&quot;, was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty.

At daybreak, preceded by a small boat taking soundings, Maynard&#x27;s two sloops entered the channel. The small craft was quickly spotted by &quot;Adventure&quot; and fired at as soon as it was within range of her guns. While the boat made a quick retreat to the &quot;Jane&quot;, Teach cut the &quot;Adventure&quot;″s anchor cable. His crew hoisted the sails and the &quot;Adventure&quot; manoeuvred to point her starboard guns toward Maynard&#x27;s sloops, which were slowly closing the gap. Hyde moved &quot;Ranger&quot; to the port side of &quot;Jane&quot; and the Union flag was unfurled on each ship. &quot;Adventure&quot; then turned toward the beach of Ocracoke Island, heading for a narrow channel. What happened next is uncertain. Johnson claimed that there was an exchange of small arms fire following which &quot;Adventure&quot; ran aground on a sandbar, and Maynard anchored and then lightened his ship to pass over the obstacle. Another version claimed that &quot;Jane&quot; and &quot;Ranger&quot; ran aground, although Maynard made no mention of this in his log.

The &quot;Adventure&quot; eventually turned her guns on the two ships and fired. The broadside was devastating; in an instant, Maynard had lost as much as a third of his forces. About 20 on &quot;Jane&quot; were either wounded or killed and 9 on &quot;Ranger&quot;. Hyde was dead and his second and third officers either dead or seriously injured. His sloop was so badly damaged that it played no further role in the attack. Contemporary accounts of what happened next are confused, but small-arms fire from &quot;Jane&quot; may have cut &quot;Adventure&quot;″s jib sheet, causing her to lose control and run onto the sandbar. In the aftermath of Teach&#x27;s overwhelming attack, &quot;Jane&quot; and &quot;Ranger&quot; may also have been grounded; the battle would have become a race to see who could float their ship first.
Maynard had kept many of his men below deck, and in anticipation of being boarded told them to prepare for close fighting. Teach watched as the gap between the vessels closed, and ordered his men to be ready. The two vessels contacted one another as the &quot;Adventure&quot;″s grappling hooks hit their target and several grenades, made from powder and shot-filled bottles and ignited by fuses, broke across the sloop&#x27;s deck. As the smoke cleared, Teach led his men aboard, buoyant at the sight of Maynard&#x27;s apparently empty ship, his men firing at the small group of men with Maynard at the stern.

The rest of Maynard&#x27;s men then burst from the hold, shouting and firing. The plan to surprise Teach and his crew worked; the pirates were apparently taken aback at the assault. Teach rallied his men and the two groups fought across the deck, which was already slick with blood from those killed or injured by Teach&#x27;s broadside. Maynard and Teach fired their flintlocks at each other. Maynard managed to hit Teach, while Teach missed. Both then threw their flintlocks away and drew their cutlasses. Teach broke Maynard&#x27;s cutlass at the hilt. Against superior training and a slight advantage in numbers, the pirates were pushed back toward the bow, allowing the &quot;Jane&quot;″s crew to surround Maynard and Teach, who was by then completely isolated. Teach pressed onward and was about to deliver a killing blow, but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynard&#x27;s men. This redirected Teach&#x27;s cutlass to strike Maynard&#x27;s knuckles instead of killing him. Badly wounded, Teach was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynard&#x27;s crew. The remaining pirates quickly surrendered. Those left on the &quot;Adventure&quot; were captured by the &quot;Ranger&quot;″s crew, including one who planned to set fire to the powder room and blow up the ship. Varying accounts exist of the battle&#x27;s list of casualties; Maynard reported that 8 of his men and 12 pirates were killed. Brand reported that 10 pirates and 11 of Maynard&#x27;s men were killed. Spotswood claimed ten pirates and ten of the King&#x27;s men dead.
Maynard later examined Teach&#x27;s body, noting that it had been shot five times and cut about twenty. He also found several items of correspondence, including a letter from Tobias Knight. Teach&#x27;s corpse was thrown into the inlet and his head was suspended from the bowsprit of Maynard&#x27;s sloop so that the reward could be collected. On their return to Virginia, Teach&#x27;s head was placed on a pole at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay as a warning to other pirates and a greeting to other ships, and it stood there for several years.

==Legacy==
Lieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days, making repairs and burying the dead. Teach&#x27;s loot—sugar, cocoa, indigo and cotton—found &quot;in pirate sloops and ashore in a tent where the sloops lay&quot;, was sold at auction along with sugar and cotton found in Tobias Knight&#x27;s barn, for £2,238. Governor Spotswood used a portion of this to pay for the entire operation. The prize money for capturing Teach was to have been about £400 (£ in 2025), but it was split between the crews of HMS &quot;Lyme&quot; and HMS &quot;Pearl&quot;. As Captain Brand and his troops had not been the ones fighting for their lives, Maynard thought this extremely unfair. He lost much of any support he might have had though when it was discovered that he and his crew had helped themselves to about £90 of Teach&#x27;s booty. The two companies did not receive their prize money for another four years, and despite his bravery Maynard was not promoted, and faded into obscurity.

The remainder of Teach&#x27;s crew and former associates were found by Brand, in Bath, and were transported to Williamsburg, Virginia, where they were jailed on charges of piracy. Several were black, prompting Spotswood to ask his council what could be done about &quot;the Circumstances of these Negroes to exempt them from undergoing the same Tryal as other pirates.&quot; Regardless, the men were tried with their comrades in Williamsburg&#x27;s Capitol building, under admiralty law, on 12 March 1719. No records of the day&#x27;s proceedings remain, but 14 of the 16 accused were found guilty. Of the remaining two, one proved that he had partaken of the fight out of necessity, having been on Teach&#x27;s ship only as a guest at a drinking party the night before, and not as a pirate. The other, Israel Hands, was not present at the fight. He claimed that during a drinking session Teach had shot him in the knee, and that he was still covered by the royal pardon. The remaining pirates were hanged, then left to rot in gibbets along Williamsburg&#x27;s Capitol Landing Road (known for some time after as &quot;Gallows Road&quot;).

Governor Eden was certainly embarrassed by Spotswood&#x27;s invasion of North Carolina, and Spotswood disavowed himself of any part of the seizure. He defended his actions, writing to Lord Carteret, a shareholder of the province of Carolina, that he might benefit from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests. He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden &quot;could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design&quot;, and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king. Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice. By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion. Lee (1974) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods. Eden doubtless shared the same view. As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach, on 4 April 1719, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning. Israel Hands had, weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the &quot;Adventure&quot; in August 1718, shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize. Four pirates had testified that with Teach they had visited Knight&#x27;s home to give him presents. This testimony and the letter found on Teach&#x27;s body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence. Despite being very sick and close to death, he questioned the reliability of Spotswood&#x27;s witnesses. He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress, and that under North Carolinian law the other witness, an African, was unable to testify. The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally, and Teach had visited him only on business, in his official capacity. The board found Knight innocent of all charges. He died later that year.

Eden was annoyed that the accusations against Knight arose during a trial in which he played no part. The goods which Brand seized were officially North Carolinian property and Eden considered him a thief. The argument raged back and forth between the colonies until Eden&#x27;s death on 17 March 1722. His will named one of Spotswood&#x27;s opponents, John Holloway, a beneficiary. In the same year, Spotswood, who for years had fought his enemies in the House of Burgesses and the council, was replaced by Hugh Drysdale, once Robert Walpole was convinced to act.

==Modern view==

Official views on pirates were sometimes quite different from those held by contemporary authors, who often described their subjects as despicable rogues of the sea. Privateers who became pirates were generally considered by the English government to be reserve naval forces, and were sometimes given active encouragement; as far back as 1581 Francis Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, when he returned to England from a round-the-world expedition with plunder worth an estimated £1,500,000. Royal pardons were regularly issued, usually when England was on the verge of war, and the public&#x27;s opinion of pirates was often favourable, some considering them akin to patrons. Economist Peter Leeson believes that pirates were generally shrewd businessmen, far removed from the modern, romanticised view of them as barbarians. After Woodes Rogers&#x27; 1718 landing at New Providence and his ending of the pirate republic, piracy in the West Indies fell into terminal decline. With no easily accessible outlet to fence their stolen goods, pirates were reduced to a subsistence livelihood, and following almost a century of naval warfare between the British, French and Spanish—during which sailors could find easy employment—lone privateers found themselves outnumbered by the powerful ships employed by the British Empire to defend its merchant fleets. The popularity of the slave trade helped bring to an end the frontier condition of the West Indies, and in these circumstances, piracy was no longer able to flourish as it once did.

Since the end of the Golden Age of Piracy, Teach and his exploits have become the stuff of lore, inspiring books, films and even amusement park rides. Much of what is known about him can be sourced to Charles Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates&quot;, published in Britain in 1724. A recognised authority on the pirates of his time, Johnson&#x27;s descriptions of such figures as Anne Bonny and Mary Read were for years required reading for those interested in the subject. Readers were titillated by his stories and a second edition was quickly published, though author Angus Konstam suspects that Johnson&#x27;s entry on Blackbeard was &quot;coloured a little to make a more sensational story.&quot; &quot;A General Historie&quot;, though, is generally considered to be a reliable source. Johnson may have been an assumed alias. As Johnson&#x27;s accounts have been corroborated in personal and official dispatches, Lee (1974) considers that whoever he was, he had some access to official correspondence. Konstam speculates further, suggesting that Johnson may have been the English playwright Charles Johnson, the British publisher Charles Rivington, or the writer Daniel Defoe. In his 1951 work &quot;The Great Days of Piracy&quot;, author George Woodbury wrote that Johnson is &quot;obviously a pseudonym&quot;, continuing &quot;one cannot help suspecting that he may have been a pirate himself.&quot;

Despite his infamy, Teach was not the most successful of pirates. Henry Every retired a rich man, and Bartholomew Roberts took an estimated five times the amount Teach stole. Treasure hunters have long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumoured hoard of gold and silver, but nothing found in the numerous sites explored along the east coast of the US has ever been connected to him. Some tales suggest that pirates often killed a prisoner on the spot where they buried their loot, and Teach is no exception in these stories, but that no finds have come to light is not exceptional; buried pirate treasure is often considered a modern myth for which almost no supporting evidence exists. The available records include nothing to suggest that the burial of treasure was a common practice, except in the imaginations of the writers of fictional accounts such as &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Such hoards would necessitate a wealthy owner, and their supposed existence ignores the command structure of a pirate vessel, in which the crew served for a share of the profit. The only pirate ever known to bury treasure was William Kidd. The only treasure so far recovered from Teach&#x27;s exploits is that taken from the wreckage of what is presumed to be the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, which was found in 1996 by Intersal Inc., a private research firm. As of 2013 around 280,000 artefacts had been recovered from the wreck site, a selection of which is on public display at the North Carolina Maritime Museum.

Various superstitious tales exist of Teach&#x27;s ghost. Unexplained lights at sea are often referred to as &quot;Teach&#x27;s light&quot;, and some recitals claim that the notorious pirate now roams the afterlife searching for his head, for fear that his friends, and the Devil, will not recognise him. A North Carolinian tale holds that Teach&#x27;s skull was used as the basis for a silver drinking chalice; a local judge even claimed to have drunk from it one night in the 1930s.

The name of Blackbeard has been attached to many local attractions, such as Charleston&#x27;s Blackbeard&#x27;s Cove. His name and persona have also featured heavily in literature. He is the main subject of Matilda Douglas&#x27;s fictional 1835 work &quot;Blackbeard: A page from the colonial history of Philadelphia&quot;.

Film renditions of his life include &quot;Blackbeard the Pirate&quot; (1952) starring West Country native Robert Newton whose exaggerated West Country accent is credited with popularising the stereotypical &quot;pirate voice&quot;, &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1968), &quot;Blackbeard: Terror at Sea&quot; (2005) and the 2006 Hallmark Channel miniseries &quot;Blackbeard&quot;. Parallels have also been drawn between Johnson&#x27;s Blackbeard and the character of Captain Jack Sparrow in the 2003 adventure film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. Blackbeard is also portrayed as a central character in three TV series: by John Malkovich in &quot;Crossbones&quot; (2014), by Ray Stevenson in seasons three and four of &quot;Black Sails&quot; (2016–2017), and by Taika Waititi in &quot;Our Flag Means Death&quot; (2022).

In 2013 and 2015, the state government of North Carolina uploaded Nautilus Productions videos of the wreck of the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; to its website without permission. As a result, Nautilus Productions, the company documenting the recovery since 1998, filed suit in federal court over copyright violations and the passage of &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Law&quot; by the North Carolina General Assembly. Before posting the videos the General Assembly passed &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Law&quot;, N.C. Gen Stat §121-25(b), which stated, &quot;All photographs, video recordings, or other documentary materials of a derelict vessel or shipwreck or its contents, relics, artifacts, or historic materials in the custody of any agency of North Carolina government or its subdivisions shall be a public record pursuant to Chapter 132 of the General Statutes.&quot; On 5 November 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in &quot;Allen v. Cooper&quot;. The Supreme Court subsequently ruled in the state&#x27;s favor, and struck down the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act, which Congress passed in 1989 to attempt to curb such infringements of copyright by states.

As a result of the ruling Nautilus filed a motion for reconsideration in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. On 18 August 2021 Judge Terrence Boyle granted the motion for reconsideration which North Carolina promptly appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The 4th Circuit denied the state&#x27;s motion on 14 October 2022. Nautilus then filed their second amended complaint on 8 February 2023 alleging 5th and 14th Amendment violations of Nautilus&#x27; constitutional rights, additional copyright violations, and claiming that North Carolina&#x27;s &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Law&quot; represents a Bill of Attainder. Eight years after the passage of Blackbeard&#x27;s Law, on 30 June 2023, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper signed a bill repealing the law.

<text>Bugzilla is a web-based general-purpose bug tracking system and testing tool originally developed and used by the Mozilla project, and licensed under the Mozilla Public License.

Released as open-source software by Netscape Communications in 1998, it has been adopted by a variety of organizations for use as a bug tracking system for both free and open-source software and proprietary projects and products. Bugzilla is used, among others, by the Mozilla Foundation, WebKit, Linux kernel, FreeBSD, KDE, Apache, Eclipse and LibreOffice. Red Hat uses it, but is gradually migrating its product to use Jira. It is also self-hosting.

== History ==

Bugzilla was originally devised by Terry Weissman in 1998 for the nascent Mozilla.org project, as an open source application to replace the in-house system then in use at Netscape Communications for tracking defects in the Netscape Communicator suite. Bugzilla was originally written in Tcl, but Weissman decided to port it to Perl before its release as part of Netscape&#x27;s early open-source code drops, in the hope that more people would be able to contribute to it, given that Perl seemed to be a more popular language at the time.

Bugzilla 2.0 was the result of that port to Perl, and the first version was released to the public via anonymous CVS. In April 2000, Weissman handed over control of the Bugzilla project to Tara Hernandez. Under her leadership, some of the regular contributors were coerced into taking more responsibility, and Bugzilla development became more community-driven. In July 2001, facing distraction from her other responsibilities in Netscape, Hernandez handed control to Dave Miller, who was still in charge .

Bugzilla 3.0 was released on May 10, 2007, and brought a refreshed UI, an XML-RPC interface, custom fields and resolutions, mod_perl support, shared saved searches, and improved UTF-8 support, along with other changes.

Bugzilla 4.0 was released on February 15, 2011, and Bugzilla 5.0 was released in July 2015.

=== Timeline ===

Bugzilla&#x27;s release timeline:

== Requirements ==

Bugzilla&#x27;s system requirements include:

* A compatible database management system
* A suitable release of Perl 5
* An assortment of Perl modules
* A compatible web server
* A suitable mail transfer agent, or any SMTP server

Currently supported database systems are MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQLite. Bugzilla is usually installed on Linux using the Apache HTTP Server, but any web server that supports CGI such as Lighttpd, Hiawatha, Cherokee can be used. Bugzilla&#x27;s installation process is command line driven and runs through a series of stages where system requirements and software capabilities are checked.

== Design ==
While the potential exists in the code to turn Bugzilla into a technical support ticket system, task management tool, or project management tool, Bugzilla&#x27;s developers have chosen to focus on the task of designing a system to track software defects.

== Zarro Boogs ==

Bugzilla returns the string &quot;zarro boogs found&quot; instead of &quot;0 bugs found&quot; when a search for bugs returns no results. &quot;Zarro Boogs&quot; is intended as a &#x27;buggy&#x27; statement itself (a misspelling of &quot;zero bugs&quot;) and is thus a meta-statement about the nature of software debugging, implying that even when no bugs have been identified, some may exist.

The following comment is provided in the Bugzilla source code to developers who may be confused by this behaviour:

:Zarro Boogs Found
:This is just a goofy way of saying that there were no bugs found matching your query. When asked to explain this message, Terry Weissman had the following to say:

:I&#x27;ve been asked to explain this ... way back when, when Netscape released version 4.0 of its browser, we had a release party. Naturally, there had been a big push to try and fix every known bug before the release. Naturally, that hadn&#x27;t actually happened. (This is not unique to Netscape or to 4.0; the same thing has happened with every software project I&#x27;ve ever seen.) Anyway, at the release party, T-shirts were handed out that said something like &quot;Netscape 4.0: Zarro Boogs&quot;. Just like the software, the T-shirt had no known bugs. Uh-huh. So, when you query for a list of bugs, and it gets no results, you can think of this as a friendly reminder. Of *course* there are bugs matching your query, they just aren&#x27;t in the bugsystem yet...
:— Terry Weissman

==WONTFIX==

WONTFIX is used as a label on issues in Bugzilla and other systems. It indicates that a verified issue will not be addressed for one of several possible reasons including fixing would be too expensive, complicated or risky.

<doc id="4575" wikidata="Q182659" url="?curid=4575" title="Ballad">
<text>A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of Great Britain and Ireland from the Late Middle Ages until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in Australia, North Africa, North America and South America.

While ballads have no prescribed structure and may vary in their number of lines and stanzas, many ballads employ quatrains with ABCB or ABAB rhyme schemes, the key being a rhymed second and fourth line. Contrary to a popular conception, it is rare if not unheard-of for a ballad to contain exactly 13 lines. Additionally, couplets rarely appear in ballads.

Many ballads were written and sold as single-sheet broadsides. The form was often used by poets and composers from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century, the term took on the meaning of a slow form of popular love song and is often used for any love song, particularly the sentimental ballad of pop or rock music, although the term is also associated with the concept of a stylized storytelling song or poem, particularly when used as a title for other media such as a film.

==Origins==
A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French &quot;chanson balladée&quot; or &quot;ballade&quot;, which were originally &quot;dancing songs&quot; (L: &quot;ballare&quot;, to dance), yet becoming &quot;stylized forms of solo song&quot; before being adopted in England. As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from Scandinavian and Germanic traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Musically they were influenced by the Minnelieder of the Minnesang tradition. The earliest example of a recognizable ballad in form in England is &quot;Judas&quot; in a 13th-century manuscript.

==Ballad form==
Ballads were originally written to accompany dances, and so were composed in couplets with refrains in alternate lines. These refrains would have been sung by the dancers in time with the dance. Most northern and west European ballads are written in ballad stanzas or quatrains (four-line stanzas) of alternating lines of iambic (an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable) tetrameter (eight syllables) and iambic trimeter (six syllables), known as ballad meter. Usually, only the second and fourth line of a quatrain are rhymed (in the scheme a, b, c, b), which has been taken to suggest that, originally, ballads consisted of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. This can be seen in this stanza from &quot;Lord Thomas and Fair Annet&quot;:

The horse | fair Ann | et rode | upon |
He amb | led like | the wind |,
With sil | ver he | was shod | before,
With burn | ing gold | behind |.

There is considerable variation on this pattern in almost every respect, including length, number of lines and rhyming scheme, making the strict definition of a ballad extremely difficult. In southern and eastern Europe, and in countries that derive their tradition from them, ballad structure differs significantly, like Spanish &quot;romanceros&quot;, which are octosyllabic and use consonance rather than rhyme.

Ballads usually are heavily influenced by the regions in which they originate and use the common dialect of the people. Scotland&#x27;s ballads in particular, both in theme and language, are strongly characterised by their distinctive tradition, even exhibiting some pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as travel to the Fairy Kingdom in the Scots ballad &quot;Tam Lin&quot;. The ballads do not have any known author or correct version; instead, having been passed down mainly by oral tradition since the Middle Ages, there are many variations of each. The ballads remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the 18th century led collectors such as Bishop Thomas Percy (1729–1811) to publish volumes of popular ballads.

In all traditions most ballads are narrative in nature, with a self-contained story, often concise, and rely on imagery, rather than description, which can be tragic, historical, romantic or comic. Themes concerning rural labourers and their sexuality are common, and there are many ballads based on the Robin Hood legend. Another common feature of ballads is repetition, sometimes of fourth lines in succeeding stanzas, as a refrain, sometimes of third and fourth lines of a stanza and sometimes of entire stanzas.

==Composition==
Scholars of ballads have been divided into &quot;communalists&quot;, such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) and the Brothers Grimm, who argue that ballads are originally communal compositions, and &quot;individualists&quot; such as Cecil Sharp, who assert that there was one single original author. Communalists tend to see more recent, particularly printed, broadside ballads of known authorship as a debased form of the genre, while individualists see variants as corruptions of an original text. More recently scholars have pointed to the interchange of oral and written forms of the ballad.

==Transmission==

The transmission of ballads comprises a key stage in their re-composition. In romantic terms this process is often dramatized as a narrative of degeneration away from the pure &#x27;folk memory&#x27; or &#x27;immemorial tradition&#x27;. In the introduction to &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot; (1802) the romantic poet and historical novelist Walter Scott argued a need to &#x27;remove obvious corruptions&#x27; in order to attempt to restore a supposed original. For Scott, the process of multiple recitations &#x27;incurs the risk of impertinent interpolations from the conceit of one rehearser, unintelligible blunders from the stupidity of another, and omissions equally to be regretted, from the want of memory of a third.&#x27; Similarly, John Robert Moore noted &#x27;a natural tendency to oblivescence&#x27;.

==Classification==
European Ballads have been generally classified into three major groups: traditional, broadside and literary. In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and &#x27;Native American ballads&#x27;, developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music. For the late 20th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term &#x27;ballad&#x27; to mean a slow love song.

===Traditional ballads===
The traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering minstrels of late medieval Europe. From the end of the 15th century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music. A reference in William Langland&#x27;s &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; indicates that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is Wynkyn de Worde&#x27;s collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.

Early collections of English ballads were made by Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) and in the Roxburghe Ballads collected by Robert Harley, (1661–1724), which paralleled the work in Scotland by Walter Scott and Robert Burns. Inspired by his reading as a teenager of &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; by Thomas Percy, Scott began collecting ballads while he attended Edinburgh University in the 1790s. He published his research from 1802 to 1803 in a three-volume work, &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot;. Burns collaborated with James Johnson on the multi-volume &quot;Scots Musical Museum&quot;, a miscellany of folk songs and poetry with original work by Burns. Around the same time, he worked with George Thompson on &quot;A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice&quot;.

Both Northern English and Southern Scots shared in the identified tradition of Border ballads, particularly evinced by the cross-border narrative in versions of &quot;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&quot; sometimes associated with the Lancashire-born sixteenth-century minstrel Richard Sheale.

It has been suggested that the increasing interest in traditional popular ballads during the eighteenth century was prompted by social issues such as the enclosure movement as many of the ballads deal with themes concerning rural laborers. James Davey has suggested that the common themes of sailing and naval battles may also have prompted the use (at least in England) of popular ballads as naval recruitment tools.

Key work on the traditional ballad was undertaken in the late 19th century in Denmark by Svend Grundtvig and for England and Scotland by the Harvard professor Francis James Child. They attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions. Since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot;. There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous. The traditional form and content of the ballad were modified to form the basis for twenty-three bawdy pornographic ballads that appeared in the underground Victorian magazine &quot;The Pearl&quot;, which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880. Unlike the traditional ballad, these obscene ballads aggressively mocked sentimental nostalgia and local lore.

===Broadsides===
Broadside ballads (also known as &#x27;broadsheet&#x27;, &#x27;stall&#x27;, &#x27;vulgar&#x27; or &#x27;come all ye&#x27; ballads) were a product of the development of cheap print in the 16th century. They were generally printed on one side of a medium to large sheet of poor quality paper. In the first half of the 17th century, they were printed in black-letter or gothic type and included multiple, eye-catching illustrations, a popular tune title, as well as an alluring poem. By the 18th century, they were printed in white letter or roman type and often without much decoration (as well as tune title). These later sheets could include many individual songs, which would be cut apart and sold individually as &quot;slip songs.&quot; Alternatively, they might be folded to make small cheap books or &quot;chapbooks&quot; which often drew on ballad stories. They were produced in huge numbers, with over 400,000 being sold in England annually by the 1660s. Tessa Watt estimates the number of copies sold may have been in the millions. Many were sold by travelling chapmen in city streets or at fairs. The subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad, although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides. Among the topics were love, marriage, religion, drinking-songs, legends, and early journalism, which included disasters, political events and signs, wonders and prodigies.

===Literary ballads===
Literary or lyrical ballads grew out of an increasing interest in the ballad form among social elites and intellectuals, particularly in the Romantic movement from the later 18th century. Respected literary figures Robert Burns and Walter Scott in Scotland collected and wrote their own ballads. Similarly in England William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge produced a collection of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; in 1798 that included Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;. Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats were attracted to the simple and natural style of these folk ballads and tried to imitate it. At the same time in Germany Goethe cooperated with Schiller on a series of ballads, some of which were later set to music by Schubert. Later important examples of the poetic form included Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Barrack-Room Ballads&quot; (1892–6) and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot; (1897).

==Ballad operas==
In the 18th century ballad operas developed as a form of English stage entertainment, partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene. It consisted of racy and often satirical spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Rather than the more aristocratic themes and music of the Italian opera, the ballad operas were set to the music of popular folk songs and dealt with lower-class characters. Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.

The first, most important and successful was &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; of 1728, with a libretto by John Gay and music arranged by John Christopher Pepusch, both of whom probably influenced by Parisian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of Thomas d&#x27;Urfey (1653–1723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work. Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title &quot;Polly&quot;. Henry Fielding, Colley Cibber, Arne, Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity. Ballad opera was attempted in America and Prussia. Later it moved into a more pastoral form, like Isaac Bickerstaffe&#x27;s &quot;Love in a Village&quot; (1763) and Shield&#x27;s &quot;Rosina&quot; (1781), using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the 18th century its influence can be seen in light operas like that of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s early works like &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; as well as in the modern musical.

In the 20th century, one of the most influential plays, Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s (1928) &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; was a reworking of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite, but only using one tune from the original. The term ballad opera has also been used to describe musicals using folk music, such as &quot;The Martins and the Coys&quot; in 1944, and Peter Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;The Transports&quot; in 1977. The satiric elements of ballad opera can be seen in some modern musicals such as &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Cabaret&quot;.

==Beyond Europe==
===American ballads===

Some 300 ballads sung in North America have been identified as having origins in Scottish traditional or broadside ballads. Examples include &#x27;The Streets of Laredo&#x27;, which was found in Great Britain and Ireland as &#x27;The Unfortunate Rake&#x27;; however, a further 400 have been identified as originating in America, including among the best known, &#x27;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&#x27; and &#x27;Jesse James&#x27;. They became an increasing area of interest for scholars in the 19th century and most were recorded or catalogued by George Malcolm Laws, although some have since been found to have British origins and additional songs have since been collected. They are usually considered closest in form to British broadside ballads and in terms of style are largely indistinguishable, however, they demonstrate a particular concern with occupations, journalistic style and often lack the ribaldry of British broadside ballads.

===Blues ballads===

The blues ballad has been seen as a fusion of Anglo-American and Afro-American styles of music from the 19th century. Blues ballads tend to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, but frequently lacking a strong narrative and emphasizing character instead. They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar which followed the blues musical format. The most famous blues ballads include those about John Henry and Casey Jones.

===Bush ballads===
The ballad was taken to Australia by early settlers from Great Britain and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural outback. The rhyming songs, poems and tales written in the form of ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in The Bush, and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards. The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including John Meredith whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the National Library of Australia. The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, sheep shearing, wanderings, war stories, the 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike, class conflicts between the landless working class and the squatters (landowners), and outlaws such as Ned Kelly, as well as love interests and more modern fare such as trucking. The most famous bush ballad is &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, which has been called &quot;the unofficial national anthem of Australia&quot;.

==Sentimental ballads==

Sentimental ballads, sometimes called &quot;tear-jerkers&quot; or &quot;drawing-room ballads&quot; owing to their popularity with the middle classes, had their origins in the early &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; music industry of the later 19th century. They were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an opera (descendants perhaps of broadside ballads, but with printed music, and usually newly composed). Such songs include &quot;Little Rosewood Casket&quot; (1870), &quot;After the Ball&quot; (1892) and &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. The association with sentimentality led to the term &quot;ballad&quot; being used for slow love songs from the 1950s onwards. Modern variations include &quot;jazz ballads&quot;, &quot;pop ballads&quot;, &quot;rock ballads&quot;, &quot;R&amp;B ballads&quot; and &quot;power ballads&quot;.

<text>Blue Öyster Cult ( ; sometimes abbreviated BÖC or BOC) is an American rock band formed on Long Island, New York, in the hamlet of Stony Brook, in 1967. 
The band has sold 25 million records worldwide, including 7 million in the United States. The band&#x27;s fusion of hard rock with psychedelia, and penchant for occult, fantastical and tongue-in-cheek lyrics, had a major influence on heavy metal music. They developed a cult following and, while achieving mainstream hits like &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; (1976) and &quot;Burnin&#x27; for You&quot; (1981), their commercial success was limited. Both songs, and others such as &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1977), remain classic rock radio staples. The band were early adopters of the music video format, and their videos received heavy rotation on MTV in its early period.

Blue Öyster Cult continued making studio albums and touring throughout the 1980s, although their popularity had declined such that they were dropped from their longtime label CBS/Columbia Records, following the commercial failure of their 11th studio album &quot;Imaginos&quot; (1988). Other than contributing to the soundtrack of the 1992 film &quot;Bad Channels&quot; and an album of re-recorded material, &quot;Cult Classic&quot;, in 1994, the band continued as a live act until releasing its first studio album of original material in 10 years, &quot;Heaven Forbid&quot; (1998). The lackluster sales of its follow-up &quot;Curse of the Hidden Mirror&quot; (2001) led to another hiatus from studio recording, but they continued performing live. Two more studio albums were released in the 2020s, &quot;The Symbol Remains&quot; (2020) and &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; (2024), the latter of which is said to be the band&#x27;s last.

Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s longest-lasting and the most commercially successful lineup included Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals), Eric Bloom (lead vocals, &quot;stun guitar&quot;, keyboards, synthesizer), Allen Lanier (keyboards, rhythm guitar), Joe Bouchard (bass, vocals, keyboards), and Albert Bouchard (drums, percussion, vocals, miscellaneous instruments). The band&#x27;s current lineup still includes Bloom and Roeser, in addition to Danny Miranda (bass, backing vocals), Richie Castellano (keyboards, rhythm guitar, backing vocals), and Jules Radino (drums, percussion). The duo of the band&#x27;s manager Sandy Pearlman and rock critic Richard Meltzer, who also met at Stony Brook University, played a key role in writing many of the band&#x27;s lyrics.

==History==
===Early years as Soft White Underbelly (1967–1971)===
Blue Öyster Cult was formed in 1967 as Soft White Underbelly (a name the group would occasionally use in the 1970s and 1980s to play small club gigs around the United States and UK) in a communal house at Stony Brook University on Long Island when rock critic Sandy Pearlman overheard a jam session consisting of fellow Stony Brook classmate Donald Roeser and his friends. Pearlman offered to become the band&#x27;s manager and creative partner, to which the band agreed. The band&#x27;s original lineup consisted of guitarist Roeser, drummer Albert Bouchard, keyboardist Allen Lanier, Les Braunstein and bassist Andrew Winters.

In October 1967, the band made its debut performance as Steve Noonan&#x27;s backing band at the Stony Brook University Gymnasium, a gig booked by Pearlman. The band&#x27;s name came from Winston Churchill&#x27;s description of Italy as &quot;the soft underbelly of the Axis.&quot;

Pearlman was important to the band – he was able to get them gigs and recording contracts with Elektra and Columbia, and he provided them with his poetry for use as lyrics for many of their songs, including &quot;Astronomy.&quot; Writer Richard Meltzer, also a Stony Brook University student, provided the band with lyrics from their early days up through their most recent studio album. In 1968, the band moved in together at their first house in the Thomaston area of Great Neck, New York. The band recorded an album&#x27;s worth of material for Elektra Records in 1968.

Braunstein played his final show as Soft White Underbelly&#x27;s lead singer in the spring of 1969. His departure led Elektra to shelve the album recorded with him on vocals.

Eric Bloom was hired by the band as their acoustic engineer. He eventually replaced Braunstein as lead singer through a series of unlikely coincidences, one being Lanier deciding to join Bloom on a drive to an upstate gig, where he spent the night with Bloom&#x27;s old college bandmates and got to hear old tapes of Bloom&#x27;s talent as lead vocalist. Because of this, Bloom was offered the job of lead singer for Soft White Underbelly.

However, a bad review of a 1969 Fillmore East show caused Pearlman to change the name of the band – first to Oaxaca, then to the Stalk-Forrest Group. Pearlman also gave stage names to each of the band members (Jesse Python for Eric Bloom, Buck Dharma for Donald Roeser, Andy Panda for Andy Winters, Prince Omega for Albert Bouchard, La Verne for Allen Lanier) but only Buck Dharma kept his. The band recorded yet another album&#x27;s worth of material for Elektra, but only one single (&quot;What Is Quicksand?&quot; b/w &quot;Arthur Comics&quot;) was released (and only in a promo edition of 300 copies) on Elektra Records (this album was eventually released, with additional outtakes, by Rhino Handmade Records as &quot;St. Cecilia: The Elektra Recordings&quot; in 2001). The album featured Bloom as their main lead singer, but Roeser also sang lead on a few songs, a pattern of sharing lead vocals that has continued throughout the band&#x27;s career. With Bloom, Soft White Underbelly/Stalk-Forrest Group became one of Stony Brook University&#x27;s &quot;house bands,&quot; popular on campus.

After a few more temporary band names, including the Santos Sisters, the band settled on Blue Öyster Cult in 1971 (see below for its origin).

New York City producer/composer and jingle writer David Lucas saw the band perform and took them into his Warehouse Recording Studio and produced four demos, with which Pearlman was able to get the renamed band another audition with Columbia Records. Clive Davis liked what he heard, and signed the band to the label. The first album was subsequently produced and recorded by Lucas on eight-track at Lucas&#x27; studio. Winters would leave the band and be replaced by Bouchard&#x27;s brother, Joe Bouchard.

===Black-and-white years (1971–1975)===

Their debut album &quot;Blue Öyster Cult&quot; was released in January 1972, with a black-and-white cover designed by artist Bill Gawlik. The album featured the songs &quot;Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Stairway to the Stars&quot;, and &quot;Then Came the Last Days of May&quot;. By this time, the band&#x27;s sound had become more oriented toward hard rock, but songs like &quot;She&#x27;s As Beautiful As a Foot&quot; and &quot;Redeemed&quot; also showed a strong element of the band&#x27;s psychedelic roots. Pearlman wanted the group to be the American answer to Black Sabbath. All of the band members except for Allen Lanier sang lead, a pattern that would continue on many subsequent albums, although lead singer Eric Bloom sang the majority of the songs. The album sold well, and Blue Öyster Cult toured with artists such as the Byrds, Mahavishnu Orchestra and Alice Cooper. As the band toured, its sound became heavier and more direct.

Their second album &quot;Tyranny and Mutation&quot;, released in 1973, was written while the band was on tour for their first album. It contained songs such as &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; (an ode to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a rewrite of &quot;I&#x27;m on the Lamb But I Ain&#x27;t No Sheep&quot; from their debut album, and also a reference to the novel of the same name by Stendhal), &quot;Hot Rails to Hell&quot; and &quot;Baby Ice Dog&quot;, the first of the band&#x27;s many collaborations with Patti Smith. It featured a harder-rocking approach than before, although the band&#x27;s songs were also growing more complex. The album outsold its predecessor, a trend that would continue with their next few albums.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Secret Treaties&quot; (1974), received positive reviews, featuring songs such as &quot;Career of Evil&quot; (co-written by Patti Smith), &quot;Dominance and Submission&quot; and &quot;Astronomy&quot;. As a result of constant touring, the band was now capable of headlining shows. The album continued their upward sales trend, and would eventually go gold.

As the three albums during this formative period all had black-and-white covers, the period of their career has been dubbed the &quot;black and white years&quot; by fans and critics.

===Commercial success (1975–1981)===
The band&#x27;s first live album &quot;On Your Feet or on Your Knees&quot; (1975) achieved greater success and went gold. Its success gave the band more time to work on a follow-up. The band members were able to purchase home recording equipment to record demos for their next album.

Their next studio album, &quot;Agents of Fortune&quot; (1976), was their first to go platinum and was again produced by David Lucas. It contained the hit single &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot;, which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts and has become a classic of the hard rock genre. Other major songs on the album were &quot;(This Ain&#x27;t) The Summer of Love&quot;, &quot;E.T.I. (Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)&quot; and &quot;The Revenge of Vera Gemini&quot;. Having recorded demos of the songs at home before recording the album, the band&#x27;s songwriting process had become more individual, with none of the songs featuring the collaborative writing between the band members that had been common on their earlier albums. Although the album still featured their trademark hard rock with sinister lyrics, the songs had become more conventional in structure, and the production was more polished. For the first and only time, the album featured lead vocals from all five band members, with Allen Lanier singing lead on the song &quot;True Confessions.&quot; With Albert Bouchard singing lead on three songs and Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser singing lead on one each, Eric Bloom ended up taking the lead on only four of the album&#x27;s ten songs.

For the tour, the band added lasers to their light show, for which they became known. They were among the first acts to use lasers in performance.

Their next album, &quot;Spectres&quot; (1977), had the FM radio hit &quot;Godzilla,&quot; and would become one of the band&#x27;s better-selling albums, with other well-known songs like &quot;I Love the Night&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Through the Motions&quot;. However, its sales were not as strong as those for the previous album, going gold but not platinum, becoming their first album to sell less than its predecessor. It featured even more polished production, and continued the trend of the lead vocals extensively shared between members, although Allen Lanier did not sing lead. As with the previous album, Eric Bloom sang lead on fewer than half the songs.

The band then released another live album, &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; (1978). Although it was intended as another double-live album in the vein of &quot;On Your Feet or on Your Knees&quot;, Columbia insisted that it be edited down to single-album length. It was a resounding commercial success, becoming Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s most popular album and eventually selling over two million copies. It also revealed that while the band&#x27;s studio work was becoming increasingly well-produced, they were still very much a hard rock band on stage.

It was followed by the studio album &quot;Mirrors&quot; (1979). For &quot;Mirrors&quot;, instead of working with previous producers Sandy Pearlman (who instead went on to manage Black Sabbath) and Murray Krugman, Blue Öyster Cult chose Tom Werman, who had worked with acts such as Cheap Trick and Ted Nugent. It featured the band&#x27;s glossiest production to date. It also gave Roeser, the lead vocalist on the band&#x27;s biggest hits, bigger prominence as a vocalist, singing lead on four of the nine songs. However, the resulting album sales were disappointing.

Pearlman&#x27;s association with Black Sabbath led to Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; producer Martin Birch being hired for the next Blue Öyster Cult record. The album found the band returning to their hard rock roots, and although both of the Bouchard brothers and guitarist Roeser all got lead vocal turns, Bloom would sing the majority of the tracks. The result was positive, with &quot;Cultösaurus Erectus&quot; (1980) receiving good reviews. The album went to number 12 in the United Kingdom, but did not do as well in the United States. The song &quot;Black Blade&quot;, which was written by Bloom with lyrics by science fiction and fantasy author Michael Moorcock, is a kind of retelling of Moorcock&#x27;s epic Elric of Melniboné saga. The band also did a co-headlining tour with Black Sabbath in support of the album, calling the tour &quot;Black and Blue&quot;.

Birch produced the band&#x27;s next album as well, &quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot; (1981), which peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting album. The biggest hit on this album was the Top 40 hit &quot;Burnin&#x27; for You,&quot; a song Roeser had written with a Richard Meltzer lyric. He had intended to use it on his solo album, &quot;Flat Out&quot; (1982), but he was convinced to use it on the Blue Öyster Cult album instead. The revival of the band&#x27;s heavier sound continued, albeit with fairly heavy use of synthesizers and some noticeable New Wave influence on a few tracks. It contained other fan favorites such as &quot;Joan Crawford&quot; (inspired by the book and film &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;) and &quot;Veteran of the Psychic Wars&quot;, another song co-written by Moorcock. Several of the songs had been written for the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, but only &quot;Veteran of the Psychic Wars&quot; (which had not been written for &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;) was actually used in the movie. The album marked a strong commercial resurgence for the band and achieved gold status, their first studio album since &quot;Spectres&quot; to do so.

During the tour for &quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot;, Albert Bouchard had a falling out with the others and left the band, and Rick Downey (formerly the band&#x27;s lighting designer) replaced him on drums. This marked the end of the band&#x27;s original and best-known lineup.

===Declining popularity (1982–1989)===
After leaving the band, Albert Bouchard spent five years working on a solo album based on Sandy Pearlman&#x27;s poem &quot;Imaginos&quot;. Blue Öyster Cult also released their third live album, &quot;Extraterrestrial Live&quot;, in 1982.

The band then went to the studio for the next album, &quot;The Revölution by Night&quot; (1983), with Bruce Fairbairn as producer. After two albums of a return to a harder rocking sound, the band adopted a more radio-friendly, AOR-oriented sound with Fairbairn providing a 1980s-style production. This approach met with some success, especially on its highest-charting single, Roeser&#x27;s &quot;Shooting Shark&quot;, co-written by Patti Smith and featuring Randy Jackson on bass, which reached number 83 on the charts. Bloom&#x27;s &quot;Take Me Away&quot; achieved some FM radio play. However, the album didn&#x27;t match sales of its predecessor, failed to achieve gold status, and marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s second commercial decline. After touring for &quot;Revölution&quot;, Rick Downey left, leaving Blue Öyster Cult without a drummer.

Blue Öyster Cult re-united with Albert Bouchard for a California tour in February 1985, infamously known as the &#x27;Albert Returns&#x27; Tour. This arrangement was only temporary and caused more tensions between the band and Bouchard, since he had thought he would be staying on permanently, which was not the case. The band had intended to use him only as a fill-in until another drummer could come on board, which resulted in Bouchard&#x27;s leaving after the tour. Allen Lanier also quit the band shortly thereafter, leaving them without a keyboardist and with only three remaining original members. This incarnation of the band would sometimes be referred to as &#x27;3ÖC&#x27; by fans, which is a pun on the number of original members left.

Blue Öyster Cult hired drummer Jimmy Wilcox and keyboardist Tommy Zvoncheck to finish the album &quot;Club Ninja&quot;, which was poorly received, with only &quot;Dancin&#x27; in the Ruins,&quot; one of several songs on the record written entirely by outside songwriters, enjoying minimal success on radio and MTV. The best-known original on the album is &quot;Perfect Water&quot; written by Dharma and Jim Carroll (noted author of &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;). While the band members have generally been disparaging about the album in retrospect, Joe Bouchard has stated that &quot;Perfect Water&quot; is &quot;perfect genius&quot;.

The band toured in Germany, after which bassist Bouchard left, leaving only two members of the classic lineup: Eric Bloom and Donald Roeser. Some people referred to the band as &quot;Two Öyster Cult&quot; during this period. Jon Rogers was hired to replace Joe and this version of the band finished out the 1986 tour. After it wound up that year, the band took a temporary break from recording and touring. When Blue Öyster Cult received an offer to tour in Greece in the early summer of 1987, the band reformed. Wilcox quit while Zvoncheck was fired for making excessive financial demands. Allen Lanier then was offered to rejoin and agreed, so the new line-up now featured three founding members, along with Jon Rogers returning on bass and Ron Riddle as their newest drummer.

Columbia Records was not interested in releasing the &quot;Imaginos&quot; project as an Albert Bouchard solo album so it was arranged for the record to be released in 1988 by Columbia as a Blue Öyster Cult album, with some new lead vocal overdubs from Bloom and Roeser and lead guitar overdubs from Roeser. These replaced most of Albert Bouchard&#x27;s lead vocals, as well as many lead guitar parts that had been recorded by session musicians. Joe Bouchard and Allen Lanier had earlier contributed some minor keyboard and backing vocal parts to the album, allowing all five original members to be credited. The album did not sell well (despite a positive review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine) and although the then-current Blue Öyster Cult lineup (minus both Bouchard brothers) toured to promote &quot;Imaginos&quot;, promotion by the label was virtually non-existent. Most songs from the album have not been performed live by the band since at least 1989. When Columbia Records&#x27; parent company CBS Records was purchased by Sony and became Sony Music Entertainment, Blue Öyster Cult were dropped from the label.

===First studio hiatus, &quot;Heaven Forbid&quot; and &quot;Curse of the Hidden Mirror&quot; (1990–2003)===

The band spent most of the 1990s touring without releasing an album of new material, although they did contribute two new songs to the &quot;Bad Channels&quot; movie soundtrack, released in 1992, and also released an album of re-recorded songs from the band&#x27;s original lineup, called &quot;Cult Classic&quot;, in 1994. During these years, while the three original members remained constant, there were several changes in the band&#x27;s rhythm section. Ron Riddle quit in 1991 and was followed by a series of other drummers including
Chuck Burgi (1991–1992, 1992–1995, 1996–1997), John Miceli (1992, 1995), John O&#x27;Reilly (1995–1996) and Bobby Rondinelli (1997–2004). As for the bass position, Rogers left in 1995, and was replaced by Danny Miranda.

In the late 1990s, Blue Öyster Cult secured a recording contract with CMC Records (later purchased by Sanctuary Records), and continued to tour frequently. Two studio albums were released, &quot;Heaven Forbid&quot; (1998) and &quot;Curse of the Hidden Mirror&quot; (2001). Both albums featured songs co-written by cyberpunk/horror novelist John Shirley. The first mostly featured Miranda on bass and Burgi on drums, although a few tracks feature earlier bassist Jon Rogers and one track features Rondinelli on drums, who had joined the band near the end of the recording. &quot;Curse of the Hidden Mirror&quot; features Miranda and Rondinelli as the rhythm section, and the pair contributed to the songwriting as well. Neither album sold well.

In 2001, Sony/Columbia&#x27;s reissue arm, Legacy Records issued expanded versions of the first four Blue Öyster Cult studio albums, including some previously unreleased demos and outtakes from album sessions, live recordings (from the &quot;Live 72&quot; EP), and post-&quot;St. Cecilia&quot; tunes from the Stalk-Forrest Group era.

Another live record and DVD &quot;A Long Day&#x27;s Night&quot; followed in 2002, both drawn from one concert in Chicago. This album also featured the Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Miranda, Rondinelli lineup.

===Live-only activities (2004–2016)===

Although the band&#x27;s lineup had remained stable from 1997 to 2004, they began to experience personnel changes again in 2004. Rondinelli left in 2004, and was replaced by Jules Radino. Miranda left during the same year to become the bassist for Queen + Paul Rodgers in place of the retired John Deacon. He was replaced by Richie Castellano, who would also take occasional turns as a lead vocalist onstage.

Allen Lanier retired from live performances in 2007 after not appearing with the band since late 2006. Castellano switched to rhythm guitar and keyboards (Castellano also filled in on lead guitar and vocals for an ailing Buck Dharma in two shows in 2005), and the position of bassist was taken up by Rudy Sarzo (previously a member of Quiet Riot, Whitesnake, Ozzy Osbourne and Dio), with the band employing Danny Miranda and Jon Rogers as guest bassists to fill in when Sarzo was unavailable. Sarzo then joined as an official member of the band, although Rogers continued to occasionally fill in when Sarzo was busy.

In February 2007, the Sony Legacy remaster series continued, releasing expanded versions of studio album &quot;Spectres&quot; and live album &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;.

In June 2012, the band announced that bassist Rudy Sarzo was leaving the band and was being replaced by former Utopia bassist Kasim Sulton.

In August of the same year, it was announced that Sony Legacy would be releasing a 17-disc boxed set entitled &quot;The Complete Columbia Albums Collection&quot; on October 30, 2012. The set includes the first round of the remastered series plus the long-awaited remastered versions of &quot;On Your Feet or on Your Knees&quot;, &quot;Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Cultösaurus Erectus&quot;, &quot;Fire Of Unknown Origin&quot;, &quot;Extraterrestrial Live&quot;, &quot;The Revölution by Night&quot;, &quot;Club Ninja&quot; and &quot;Imaginos&quot;. Also exclusive to this set are two discs of rare and unreleased B-sides, demos and radio broadcasts.

Also in 2012, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Blue Öyster Cult, the then-current incarnation of the band reunited for the first time in 25 years with other original members Joe and Albert Bouchard and Allen Lanier as guests for a special event in New York.

Founding keyboardist/guitarist Allen Lanier died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on August 14, 2013.

In 2016, Albert Bouchard played again as guest with the then-current line-up of the band, playing at shows in New York, Los Angeles, Dublin and London, where Blue Öyster Cult played the album &quot;Agents of Fortune&quot; in its entirety. The shows featured songs from &quot;Agents of Fortune&quot; that had either not been played live before (&quot;True Confessions&quot;, &quot;The Revenge of Vera Gemini&quot;, &quot;Sinful Love&quot;, &quot;Tenderloin&quot;, &quot;Debbie Denise&quot;), songs that had not been played since the album&#x27;s debut tour (&quot;Morning Final&quot;), and songs that were no longer/never played frequently (&quot;This Ain&#x27;t the Summer of Love&quot;, &quot;Tattoo Vampire&quot;), as well as the fan favorite &quot;Five Guitars&quot;, which had not been played since Albert initially left the band in 1981. Albert played in the following songs at the show: &quot;The Revenge of Vera Gemini&quot; (vocals, guitar), &quot;Sinful Love&quot; (vocals, guitar), &quot;Tattoo Vampire&quot; (guitar), &quot;Morning Final&quot; (guitar), &quot;Tenderloin&quot; (cymbals), &quot;Debbie Denise&quot; (vocals, acoustic guitar), &quot;Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll&quot; (vocals, drums), and &quot;Five Guitars&quot; (guitar).

===&quot;The Symbol Remains&quot; and &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; (2017–present)===

In a May 2017 appearance on Castellano&#x27;s &quot;Band Geek&quot; podcast, Bloom confirmed that there were tentative plans to release a new album in 2018 and that the band was currently considering offers from multiple record labels. He also stated that former bassist Danny Miranda would be playing with the band for the remainder of the year due to Sulton&#x27;s prior touring commitments with Todd Rundgren. During the same year, the band&#x27;s official website started to list Miranda as an official member, stating that Miranda had &quot;returned to BÖC&quot; in early 2017.

Buck Dharma stated in February 2019 that the band would be recording a new album to be released by fall. On July 10, 2019, it was announced that the band had signed to Frontiers Music, and would in fact be releasing the new album in 2020. &quot;It&#x27;s been a long time since BÖC&#x27;s last studio album. Recording with Danny, Richie and Jules should be a great experience as we&#x27;ve been touring together for years, and Buck and I look forward to including them in the creative and recording process,&quot; said Bloom. &quot;The current band is GREAT and has never been recorded other than live, so we feel now&#x27;s the time for new songs to be written and recorded. About half of the songs for the new record exist and the rest will be finished during the process,&quot; added Buck Dharma. In February 2020, Richie Castellano posted a short video to Facebook featuring himself and Eric Bloom, stating that the band were working on the new Blue Öyster Cult record remotely by using ConnectionOpen online audio collaboration tool.

In August 2020, the band announced on their website that their fifteenth studio album &quot;The Symbol Remains&quot; would be released on October 9, 2020. The span of nineteen years between &quot;Curse of the Hidden Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Symbol Remains&quot; marks the longest gap between studio albums in Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s career. The album was released to a positive critical reception, with tracks such as &quot;Box In My Head&quot; and &quot;The Alchemist&quot; receiving high praise.

In October 2022, during their European headlining tour, Blue Öyster Cult supported Deep Purple at five arena shows in the United Kingdom.

On April 12, 2024, Blue Öyster Cult released their sixteenth and final studio album &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, which includes both reimagined tracks and &quot;lost gems&quot; from between 1978 and 2016, as well as studio versions of their covers of MC5&#x27;s &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; and The Animals&#x27; &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place.&quot;.

== Musical style ==
Blue Öyster Cult is usually described as a hard rock band, albeit one with their own tongue-in-cheek style. Their music has also been described as heavy metal, psychedelic rock, occult rock, acid rock, and progressive rock. They have also been recognized for helping pioneer genres such as stoner metal. The band has also experimented with additional genres on specific albums, such as on &quot;Mirrors&quot;.

They have acknowledged the influence of artists such as Alice Cooper, Grateful Dead, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, MC5, The Blues Project, Jimi Hendrix, and Black Sabbath.

==Lyrics==
The band have frequently collaborated with outside lyricists, although all of the original members wrote lyrics at some point, most notably Donald Roeser. The principal lyricists in the early days were manager Sandy Pearlman and fellow rock critic Richard Meltzer. Key members of the New York punk scene Patti Smith, Helen &quot;Wheels&quot; Robbins and Jim Carroll - all friends of the band - contributed from the mid-1970s. Later in the decade frontman Eric Bloom, a science fiction fan, recruited English author Michael Moorcock to write for the band, and later did the same with Eric Van Lustbader and John Shirley.

In order to add to their mystique the band would often use out-of-context fragments of Pearlman&#x27;s unpublished sci-fi poetry cycle &quot;The Soft Doctrines of Imaginos&quot; as lyrics, rendering their meaning obscure. Additionally, they kept a folder of Pearlman&#x27;s and Meltzer&#x27;s word associations to insert into their songs.

== Band name and logo ==
The name &quot;Blue Öyster Cult&quot; also came from Pearlman&#x27;s &quot;Imaginos&quot; cycle, explored most extensively on the 1988 album of the same name. Pearlman had also come up with the band&#x27;s earlier name, &quot;Soft White Underbelly&quot;, from a phrase used by Winston Churchill in describing Italy during World War II. In Pearlman&#x27;s poetry, the &quot;Blue Oyster Cult&quot; is a group of aliens who had assembled secretly to guide Earth&#x27;s history. &quot;Initially, the band was not happy with the name, but settled for it, and went to work preparing to record their first release...&quot;

In a 1976 interview published in the U.K. music magazine &quot;ZigZag&quot;, Pearlman claimed the origin of the band&#x27;s name was as an anagram of &quot;Cully Stout Beer&quot;.

The addition of an umlaut was suggested by Allen Lanier, but Richard Meltzer claims to have suggested it just after Pearlman came up with the name, reportedly &quot;because of the Wagnerian aspect of Metal&quot;. Other bands later copied the practice of using umlauts or diacritic marks in their own band names, such as Motörhead, Mötley Crüe, Queensrÿche and parodied by Spın̈al Tap.

The hook-and-cross logo was designed by fellow Stony Brook student Bill Gawlik for his master&#x27;s thesis in January 1972, and appears on all of the band&#x27;s albums. In Greek mythology, &quot;... the hook-and-cross symbol is that of Kronos (Cronus), the king of the Titans and father of Zeus ... and is the alchemical symbol for lead (a heavy metal), one of the heaviest of metals.&quot; Sandy Pearlman considered this, along with the &quot;heavy&quot; distorted guitar sound of the band, meant that the description &quot;heavy metal&quot; would be apt for the band&#x27;s sound. The hook-and-cross symbol also resembled the astrological symbol for Saturn, the Roman god of agriculture, and the sickle, which is associated with both Kronos (Cronus) and Saturn (both the planet and the Roman god). The logo&#x27;s &quot;... metaphysical, alchemical and mythological connotations, combined with its similarity to some religious symbols gave it a flair of decadence and mystery ...&quot;

The band was billed, for the only time, as &quot;&quot;The&quot; Blue Öyster Cult&quot; on the cover and label of their second album, &quot;Tyranny and Mutation&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
Blue Öyster Cult have been influential to the realm of hard rock and heavy metal, leading them to being referred to as &quot;the thinking man&#x27;s heavy metal band&quot; due to their often cryptic lyrics, literate songwriting, and links to famous authors. They have influenced many acts including Iron Maiden, Metallica, Fates Warning, Iced Earth, Cirith Ungol, Alice in Chains, Twisted Sister, Ratt, Steel Panther, Green River (and later Mudhoney), Body Count, Possessed, Candlemass, Saint Vitus, Trouble, Opeth, White Zombie, Kvelertak, HIM, Turbonegro, Radio Birdman, The Cult, The Minutemen, Firehose, Hoodoo Gurus, Widespread Panic, Queens of the Stone Age, Umphrey&#x27;s McGee, Stabbing Westward, Royal Trux, and Moe.

The band&#x27;s influence has extended beyond the musical sphere. The lyrics of &quot;Astronomy&quot; have been named by author Shawn St. Jean as inspirational to the later chapters of his fantasy novel &quot;Clotho&#x27;s Loom&quot;, wherein Sandy Pearlman&#x27;s &quot;Four Winds Bar&quot; provides the setting for a portion of the action. Titles and lines from the band&#x27;s songs provided structure and narrative for the third book in Robert Galbraith&#x27;s (a pseudonym for J. K. Rowling), series of Cormoran Strike novels, &quot;Career of Evil&quot;.

Their hit single &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; was featured in the famous &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch &quot;More Cowbell&quot;. The original recording was produced at The Record Plant in New York by David Lucas, who sang background vocals with Roeser, and introduced the now-famous cowbell part, which may have been played by himself, Albert Bouchard, or Eric Bloom.

&quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; was also used in writer/director John Carpenter&#x27;s horror film classic, &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978). The opening sequence of the miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Stand&quot; (1994) by Stephen King, and covered by The Mutton Birds for Peter Jackson&#x27;s horror-comedy film &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (1996). &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; was also used throughout the comedy film &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; (1994) and plays a role in its storyline. In the film &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014), the song plays on the radio during a car driving scene with actor Ben Affleck. The song was also used as the opening theme and main story element in the 1996 FMV computer game &quot;Ripper&quot;, by Take Two Interactive, and was also featured in the 2006 game &quot;Prey&quot; and the 2021 game &quot;Returnal&quot;. The lyrics for &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; are featured in the introduction of Stephen King&#x27;s book &quot;The Stand&quot;. The song was also used in Orange Is the New Black&#x27;s season 2 finale.

<text>Battery Park City is a mainly residential planned community and neighborhood on the west side of the southern tip of the island of Manhattan in New York City. It is bounded by the Hudson River on the west, the Hudson River shoreline on the north and south, and the West Side Highway on the east. The neighborhood is named for the Battery, formerly known as Battery Park, located directly to the south.

More than one-third of the development is parkland. The land upon which it is built was created in the 1970s by land reclamation on the Hudson River using over of soil and rock excavated during the construction of the World Trade Center, the New York City Water Tunnel, and certain other construction projects, as well as from sand dredged from New York Harbor off Staten Island. The neighborhood includes Brookfield Place (formerly the World Financial Center), along with numerous buildings designed for housing, commercial, and retail.

Battery Park City is part of Manhattan Community District 1. It is patrolled by the 1st Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

== Geography ==
Battery Park City is bounded on the east by West Street, which separates the area from the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. To the west, north, and south, the area is surrounded by the Hudson River.

The development consists of roughly five major sections. Traveling north to south, the first neighborhood has high-rise residential buildings, the Stuyvesant High School, a Regal Entertainment Group movie theater, and the Battery Park City branch of the New York Public Library. It is also the site of the 463-suite Conrad New York luxury hotel, which has a ballroom and a conference center. Other restaurants located in that hotel, as well as a DSW store and a New York Sports Club branch, were closed in 2009 after the takeover of the property by Goldman Sachs. Former undeveloped lots in the area have been developed into high-rise buildings; for example, Goldman Sachs built a new headquarters at 200 West Street.

Nearby is Brookfield Place, a complex of several commercial buildings formerly known as the World Financial Center.

Current residential neighborhoods of Battery Park City are divided into northern and southern sections, separated by Brookfield Place. The northern section consists entirely of large, 20–45-story buildings, all various shades of orange brick. The southern section, extending down from the Winter Garden, which is located in Brookfield Place, contains residential apartment buildings such as Gateway Plaza and the Rector Place apartment buildings. In this section lies the majority of Battery Park City&#x27;s residential areas, in three sections: Gateway Plaza, a high-rise building complex; the &quot;Rector Place Residential Neighborhood&quot;; and the&quot; Battery Place Residential Neighborhood&quot;. These subsections contain most of the area&#x27;s residential buildings, along with park space, supermarkets, restaurants, and movie theaters. Construction of residential buildings began north of the World Financial Center in the late 1990s, and completion of the final lots took place in early 2011. Additionally, a park restoration was completed in 2013.

== History ==

=== Site and formation ===

Throughout the 19th century and early-20th century, the area adjoining today&#x27;s Battery Park City was known as Little Syria with Lebanese, Greeks, Armenians, and other ethnic groups. In 1929, the land was the proposed site of a $50 million (equivalent to $ million in ) residential development that would have served workers in the Wall Street area. The Battery Tower project was left unfinished after workers digging the foundation ran into forty feet of old bulkheads, sunken docks, and ships.

By the late-1950s, the once-prosperous port area of downtown Manhattan was occupied by a number of dilapidated shipping piers, casualties of the rise of container shipping which drove sea traffic to Port Elizabeth, New Jersey. The initial proposal to reclaim this area through landfill was offered in the early-1960s by private firms and supported by the mayor, part of a long history of Lower Manhattan expansion. That plan became complicated when Governor Nelson Rockefeller announced his desire to redevelop a part of the area as a separate project. The various groups reached a compromise, and in 1966 the governor unveiled the proposal for what would become Battery Park City. The creation of architect Wallace K. Harrison, the proposal called for a &#x27;comprehensive community&#x27; consisting of housing, social infrastructure and light industry.

In 1968, the New York State Legislature created the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) to oversee development. Rockefeller named Charles J. Urstadt as the first chairman of the authority&#x27;s board that year. He then served as the chief executive officer from 1973 to 1978. Urstadt later served as the authority&#x27;s vice chair from 1996 to 2010. The New York State Urban Development Corporation and ten other public agencies were also involved in the development project. For the next several years, the BPCA made slow progress. In April 1969, it unveiled a master plan for the area, which was approved in October. In early-1972, the BPCA issued $200 million in bonds to fund construction efforts, with Harry B. Helmsley designated as the developer. That same year, the city approved plans to alter the number of apartments designated for lower, middle and upper income renters. Urstadt said the changes were needed to make the financing for the project viable. In addition to the change in the mix of units, the city approved adding nine acres, which extended the northern boundary from Reade Street to Duane Street.

Landfill material from construction of the World Trade Center and other buildings in Lower Manhattan was used to add fill for the southern portion. Cellular cofferdams were constructed to retain the material. After removal of the piers, wooden piles and overburden of silt, the northern portion (north of, and including the marina) was filled with sand dredged from areas adjacent to Ambrose Channel in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as stone from the construction of Water Tunnel #3. By 1976, the landfill was completed. Seating stands for viewing the American Bicentennial &quot;Operation Sail&quot; flotilla parade were set up on the completed landfill in July 1976. Construction efforts ground to a halt in 1977, as a result of the city&#x27;s fiscal crisis. That year, the presidential administration of Jimmy Carter approved mortgage insurance for 1,600 of the development&#x27;s proposed units. In 1979, the title to the landfill was transferred from the city to the Battery Park City Authority, which financially restructured itself and created a new, more viable master plan, designed by Alex Cooper of Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners and Stanton Eckstut. By that time, only two of the proposed development&#x27;s buildings had been built, and the $200 million bond issue was supposed to have been paid off the next year.

The design of BPC to some degree reflects the values of vibrant city neighborhoods championed by Jane Jacobs. The Urban Land Institute (ULI) awarded the Battery Park City Master Plan its 2010 Heritage Award, for having &quot;facilitated the private development of of commercial space, of residential space, and nearly of open space in lower Manhattan, becoming a model for successful large-scale planning efforts and marking a positive shift away from the urban renewal mindset of the time.&quot;

=== Construction and early development ===
During the late-1970s and early-1980s, the site hosted Creative Time&#x27;s landmark Art on the Beach sculpture exhibitions. On September 23, 1979, the landfill was the site of an anti-nuclear rally attended by 200,000 people.

In 1978, a temporary heliport operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey opened at the southern end of the landfill and was initially used by New York Airways helicopters providing scheduled service to Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports. The helicopter landing pad later accommodated flights diverted from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport while that facility was closed for reconstruction from 1983 to 1987. The Battery Park City Heliport was located on the south side of the future site of the Museum of Jewish Heritage.

Construction began on the first residential building in June 1980. In April 1981, the New York State Urban Development Corporation (now the Empire State Development Corporation) issued a request for proposal, ultimately selecting six real-estate companies to develop over 1,800 residential units. The same year, the World Financial Center started construction; Olympia and York of Toronto was named as the developer for the World Financial Center, who then hired Cesar Pelli as the lead architect. By 1985, construction was completed and the World Financial Center (later renamed Brookfield Place New York) saw its first tenants. The newly completed development was lauded by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a triumph of urban design&quot;, with the World Financial Center being deemed &quot;a symbol of change&quot;.
During early construction, two acres of land in the southern section of the Battery Park landfill was used by artist Agnes Denes to plant wheat in an exhibition titled &quot;Wheatfield – A Confrontation&quot;. The project was a visual contradiction: a golden field of wheat set among the steel skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan. It was created during a six-month period in the spring, summer, and fall of 1982 when Denes, with the support of the Public Art Fund, planted the field of wheat on rubble-strewn land near Wall Street and the World Trade Center site. Denes stated that her &quot;decision to plant a wheatfield in Manhattan, instead of designing just another public sculpture, grew out of a long-standing concern and need to call attention to our misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values.&quot;

Throughout the 1980s, the BPCA oversaw a great deal of construction, including the entire Rector Place neighborhood and the river esplanade. It was during that period that Amanda Burden, later City Planning Department Director in the Bloomberg administration, worked on Battery Park City. During the 1980s, a total of 13 buildings were constructed. The Vietnam Veterans Plaza was established by Edward I. Koch in 1985. Constructed at a cost of $150 million (equivalent to $ million in ) and with a capacity for 2,700 students, Battery Park City became the new home of the Stuyvesant High School in 1992. During the 1990s, an additional six buildings were added to the neighborhood. By the turn of the 21st century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street.

Initially, in the 1980s, 23 buildings were built in the area. By the 1990s, 9 more buildings were built, followed by the construction of 11 buildings in the 2000s and 3 buildings in the 2010s. The Battery Park City Authority, wishing to attract more middle-class residents, started providing subsidies in 1998 to households whose annual incomes were $108,000 or less. By the end of the decade, nearly the entire landfill had been developed.

=== Early 21st century ===

The September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 had a major impact on Battery Park City. The residents of Lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced for an extended period of time. Parts of the community were an official crime scene and therefore residents were unable to return to live or even collect property. Many of the displaced residents were not allowed to return to the area for months and none were given government guidance of where to live temporarily on the already-crowded island of Manhattan. With most hotel rooms booked, residents, including young children and the elderly, were forced to fend for themselves. When they were finally allowed to return to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted.

Upon residents&#x27; return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until December 2001. More than half of the area&#x27;s residents moved away permanently from the community after the adjacent World Trade Center towers collapsed and spread toxic dust, debris, and smoke. Gateway Plaza&#x27;s 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. Temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.

After September 11, 2001, residents of Battery Park City and Tribeca formed the TriBattery Pops Tom Goodkind Conductor in response to the events of the attacks. The &quot;Pops&quot; have been Grammy-nominated and are the first lower Manhattan all-volunteer community band in a century.

Since then, real estate development in the area has continued robustly. Commercial development includes the 200 West Street, the Goldman Sachs global headquarters, which began construction in 2005 and opened for occupancy in October 2009. 200 West Street received in 2010 gold-level certification under the United States Green Building Council&#x27;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program by incorporating various water and energy conservation features. As of 2018, there is no new construction planned.

== Ownership and maintenance ==
Battery Park City is owned and managed by the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority (BPCA), a Class A New York State public-benefit corporation created by New York State in 1968 to redevelop outmoded and deteriorated piers, a project that has involved reclaiming the land, replanning the area and facilitating new construction of a mixed commercial and residential community. It has operated under the authority of the Urban Development Corporation. Its mission is &quot;to plan, create, coordinate and sustain a balanced community of commercial, residential, retail, and park space within its designated 92-acre site on the lower west side of Manhattan&quot;. The authority&#x27;s board is composed of seven uncompensated members who are appointed by the governor and who serve six-year terms. Raju Mann is the president and chief executive officer. The BPCA is invested with substantial powers: it can acquire, hold and dispose of real property, enter into lease agreements, borrow money and issue debt, and manage the project. Like other public benefit corporations, the BPCA is exempt from property taxes and has the ability to issue tax exempt bonds. In 2021, the BPCA has operating expenses of $69.1 million as well as an outstanding debt of $875.09 million, and it employed 200 people.

Under the 1989 agreement between the BPCA and the City of New York, $600 million was transferred by the BPCA to the city. Charles J. Urstadt, the first chairman and CEO of the BPCA, noted in an August 19, 2007, op-ed piece in the &quot;New York Post&quot; that the aggregate figure of funds transferred to the City of New York is above $1.4 billion, with the BPCA continuing to contribute $200 million a year. The Independent Budget Office of the City of New York also recommended the city take over Battery Park City in a report published in February 2020. The report echoed Urstadt&#x27;s proposal as a way to increase revenue to the city. An article published by &quot;The Broadsheet Daily&quot; described the complex shared ownership structure of Battery Park City between the city and state that was set up by Urstadt.

Excess revenue from the area was to be contributed to other housing efforts, typically low-income projects in the Bronx and Harlem. Much of this funding has historically been diverted to general city expenses, under section 3.d of the 1989 agreement. However, in July 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Governor George Pataki, and Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. announced the final approval for the New York City Housing Trust Fund derived from $130 million in Battery Park City revenues. The fund aimed to preserve or create 4,300 units of low- and moderate-income housing by 2009. It also provided seed financing for the New York Acquisition Fund, a $230 million initiative that aims to serve as a catalyst for the construction and preservation of more than 30,000 units of affordable housing citywide by 2016. The Acquisition Fund has since established itself as a model for similar funds in cities and states across the country.

By 2018, thirty residential buildings had been built in Battery Park City and no new construction was planned. The Battery Park City Authority&#x27;s main focus turned to maintenance of existing infrastructure, security and conservancy of the public spaces. The authority was creating over 1,000 free activities per year.

Condo owners in Battery Park City pay higher monthly charges than owners of comparable apartments elsewhere in New York City because residents pay their building&#x27;s common charges in addition to PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes). The PILOT payments replace real estate taxes and the land lease. The cumulative effect is lower property values for homeowners.

Because none of the properties in Battery Park City own the land they are built on, many banks have refused to write loans when those ground leases are periodically up for renewal. This has been a regular source of anger and frustration for owners in Battery Park City who are looking to sell.

== Buildings ==

*Millennium Point, a , 38-story skyscraper built from 1999 to 2001. It occupies the street addresses 25–39 Battery Place. However, due to the September 11 attacks which hit the nearby World Trade Center, opening of Millennium Point was delayed until January 2002. The building won the 2001 Silver Emporis Skyscraper Award. The tower section contains 113 luxury condominiums. The wider, lower 12 floors are occupied by a 5-star hotel, The Wagner at the Battery (formerly the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park).

It was designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli and completed in 2003. The Solaire is located at 20 River Terrace. The developer received funding from the State of New York, which was somewhat controversial as the developer was only required to agree to set aside 10% of the units as &quot;affordable housing&quot; or &quot;moderate income&quot;, rather than the usual 80:20 agreement. When the building opened, rents ranged from roughly $2,500 to $9,001 depending on the size of the unit. The building has been rated LEED Platinum. The energy conserving building design is 35% more energy-efficient than code requires, resulting in a 67% lower electricity demand during peak hours, resulting in, among other benefits, lower electric bills for residents.

Sustainability was a driving factor in the design of the library including use of an energy-efficient lighting system, maximization of natural lighting, and use of recycled materials. 1100 Architect, in collaboration with Atelier Ten, an international team of environmental design consultants and building services engineers, designed the library&#x27;s energy-efficient lighting system. The open plan layout and large use of glass allow for ample natural daylight year-round and low-energy LED light illuminates communal spaces. Recycled materials are incorporated into the design including carpet made from re-purposed truck tires, floors made from reclaimed window frame wood, and furniture made from FSC-certified plywood and recycled steel. Design features include a seemingly &quot;floating&quot; origami-style ceiling made up of triangular panels hung at varying angles and a padded reading nook fitted into the library&#x27;s terrazzo-finished steel and concrete staircase. The interior uses an easy-to-navigate layout with its three distinct spatial areas of entry area, first floor space, and mezzanine visually unified through the ceiling.

The building also won the &quot;Interior Design&quot;, Best of Year Merit Award in 2011, followed by &quot;The National Terrazzo and Mosaic Association&quot;, Port Morris Tile and Marble Corporation Craftsmanship Award in 2011 and the &quot;Contract&quot;, Public Space Interiors Award in 2012.

<doc id="4581" wikidata="Q804521" url="?curid=4581" title="Bacterial vaginosis">
<text>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection of the vagina caused by excessive growth of bacteria. Common symptoms include increased vaginal discharge that often smells like fish. The discharge is usually white or gray in color. Burning with urination may occur. Itching is uncommon. Occasionally, there may be no symptoms. Having BV approximately doubles the risk of infection by a number of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. It also increases the risk of early delivery among pregnant women.

BV is caused by an imbalance of the naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina. There is a change in the most common type of bacteria and a hundred to thousandfold increase in total numbers of bacteria present. Typically, bacteria other than &quot;Lactobacilli&quot; become more common. Risk factors include douching, new or multiple sex partners, antibiotics, and using an intrauterine device, among others. However, it is not considered a sexually transmitted infection and, unlike gonorrhoea and chlamydia, sexual partners are not treated. Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms, and may be verified by testing the vaginal discharge and finding a higher than normal vaginal pH, and large numbers of bacteria. BV is often confused with a vaginal yeast infection or infection with &quot;Trichomonas&quot;.

Usually treatment is with an antibiotic, such as clindamycin or metronidazole. These medications may also be used in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. The antiseptic boric acid can also be effective. BV often recurs following treatment. Probiotics may help prevent re-occurrence. It is unclear if the use of probiotics or antibiotics affects pregnancy outcomes.

BV is the most common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. The percentage of women affected at any given time varies between 5% and 70%. BV is most common in parts of Africa and least common in Asia and Europe. In the United States about 30% of women between the ages of 14 and 49 are affected. Rates vary considerably between ethnic groups within a country. While BV-like symptoms have been described for much of recorded history, the first clearly documented case occurred in 1894.

==Signs and symptoms==
Although about 50% of women with BV are asymptomatic, common symptoms include increased vaginal discharge that usually smells like fish. The discharge is often white or gray in color. There may be burning with urination. Occasionally, there may be no symptoms.

The discharge coats the walls of the vagina, and is usually without significant irritation, pain, or erythema (redness), although mild itching can sometimes occur. By contrast, the normal vaginal discharge will vary in consistency and amount throughout the menstrual cycle and is at its clearest at ovulation—about two weeks before the period starts. Some practitioners claim that BV can be asymptomatic in almost half of affected women, though others argue that this is often a misdiagnosis.

===Complications===
Although previously considered a mere nuisance infection, untreated bacterial vaginosis may cause increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and pregnancy complications.

It has been shown that HIV-infected women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) are more likely to transmit HIV to their sexual partners than those without BV.
There is evidence of an association between BV and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS. BV is associated with up to a six-fold increase in HIV shedding. BV is a risk factor for viral shedding and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection. BV may increase the risk of infection with or reactivation of human papillomavirus (HPV).

In addition, bacterial vaginosis as either pre-existing, or acquired, may increase the risk of pregnancy complications, most notably premature birth or miscarriage.
Pregnant women with BV have a higher risk of chorioamnionitis, miscarriage, preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and postpartum endometritis. Women with BV who are treated with in vitro fertilization have a lower implantation rate and higher rates of early pregnancy loss.

==Causes==

Healthy vaginal microbiota consists of species that neither cause symptoms or infections, nor negatively affect pregnancy. It is dominated mainly by Lactobacillus species. BV is defined by the disequilibrium in the vaginal microbiota, with decline in the number of lactobacilli. While the infection involves a number of bacteria, it is believed that most infections start with &quot;Gardnerella vaginalis&quot; creating a biofilm, which allows other opportunistic bacteria, such as &quot;Prevotella&quot; and &quot;Bacteroides&quot;, to thrive.

One of the main risks for developing BV is douching, which alters the vaginal microbiota and predisposes women to developing BV. Douching is strongly discouraged by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and various medical authorities, for this and other reasons.

BV is a risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease, HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), endometriosis, and reproductive and obstetric disorders or negative outcomes. Although BV can be associated with sexual activity, there is no clear evidence of sexual transmission. It is possible for sexually inactive persons to develop bacterial vaginosis.

Also, subclinical iron deficiency may correlate with bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy. A longitudinal study published in February 2006, in the &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&quot;, showed a link between psychosocial stress and bacterial vaginosis persisted even when other risk factors were taken into account. Exposure to the spermicide nonoxynol-9 does not affect the risk of developing bacterial vaginosis.

The cause of the fishy smell of BV is mainly due to reduction of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) to trimethylamine (TMA) by bacteria in vaginal secretion. TMA is the same compound that is predominantly responsible for the smell of decomposing fish. The diamines putrescine and cadaverine, which are the decarboxylation products of arginine and lysine amino acid metabolism, respectively, are also present in BV and may contribute to the fishy smell of the condition as well.

==Diagnosis==

To make a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, a swab from inside the vagina should be obtained. These swabs can be tested for:

* Gram stain which shows the depletion of lactobacilli and overgrowth of &quot;Gardnerella vaginalis&quot; bacteria. Bacterial vaginosis is usually confirmed by a Gram stain of vaginal secretions.
* A characteristic &quot;fishy&quot; odor on wet mount. This test, called the &quot;whiff test&quot;, is performed by adding a small amount of potassium hydroxide to a microscope slide containing the vaginal discharge. A characteristic fishy odor is considered a positive whiff test and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis. Addition of a base to vaginal secretion with the diamines putrescine and cadaverine causes them to become volatile and thereby produce a more intense fishy smell.
* Loss of acidity. To control bacterial growth, the vagina is normally slightly acidic with a pH of 3.8–4.2. A swab of the discharge is put onto litmus paper to check its acidity. A pH greater than 4.5 is considered alkaline and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.
* The presence of &quot;clue cells&quot; on wet mount. Similar to the whiff test, the test for clue cells is performed by placing a drop of sodium chloride solution on a slide containing vaginal discharge. If present, clue cells can be visualized under a microscope. They are so-named because they give a clue to the reason behind the discharge. These are epithelial cells that are coated with bacteria.

Differential diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis includes the following:

* Normal vaginal discharge.
* Candidiasis (thrush, or a yeast infection).
* Trichomoniasis, an infection caused by &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;.
* Aerobic vaginitis

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines STIs as &quot;a variety of clinical syndromes and infections caused by pathogens that can be acquired and transmitted through sexual activity.&quot; But the CDC does not specifically identify BV as sexually transmitted infection.

===Amsel criteria===
In clinical practice BV can be diagnosed using the Amsel criteria:

# Thin, white, yellow, homogeneous discharge
# Clue cells on microscopy
# pH of vaginal fluid &gt;4.5
# Release of a fishy odor on adding alkali—10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution.

At least three of the four criteria should be present for a confirmed diagnosis.
A modification of the Amsel criteria accepts the presence of two instead of three factors and is considered equally diagnostic.

===Gram stain===
An alternative is to use a Gram-stained vaginal smear, with the Hay/Ison criteria or the Nugent criteria. The Hay/Ison criteria are defined as follows:

* Grade 1 (Normal): Lactobacillus morphotypes predominate.
* Grade 2 (Intermediate): Some lactobacilli present, but &quot;Gardnerella&quot; or &quot;Mobiluncus&quot; morphotypes also present.
* Grade 3 (Bacterial Vaginosis): Predominantly &quot;Gardnerella&quot; and/or &quot;Mobiluncus&quot; morphotypes. Few or absent lactobacilli. (Hay et al., 1994)

&quot;Gardnerella vaginalis&quot; is the main culprit in BV. &quot;Gardnerella vaginalis&quot; is a short, Gram-variable rod (coccobacillus). Hence, the presence of clue cells and gram variable coccobacilli are indicative or diagnostic of bacterial vaginosis.

===Nugent score===
The Nugent score is now rarely used by physicians due to the time it takes to read the slides and requires the use of a trained microscopist. A score of 0–10 is generated from combining three other scores. The scores are as follows:

* 0–3 is considered negative for BV
* 4–6 is considered intermediate
* 7+ is considered indicative of BV.

At least 10–20 high power (1000× oil immersion) fields are counted and an average determined.

DNA hybridization testing with Affirm VPIII was compared to the Gram stain using the Nugent criteria. The Affirm VPIII test may be used for the rapid diagnosis of BV in symptomatic women but uses expensive proprietary equipment to read results, and does not detect other pathogens that cause BV, including &quot;Prevotella&quot; spp, &quot;Bacteroides&quot; spp, and &quot;Mobiluncus&quot; spp. The cervicovaginal microbiome measured using 16S rRNA sequencing has the capacity to increase throughput of the Nugent Score and has demonstrate to be directly comparable to clinical Nugent Score measurement.

===Screening===
Screening during pregnancy is not recommended in the United States as of 2020 because &quot; the US Preventive Services Task Force concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery&quot;.

==Prevention==
Some steps suggested to lower the risk include: not douching, avoiding sex, or limiting the number of sex partners.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses from 2022 to 2023 have concluded that probiotics may help prevent re-occurrence.

Early evidence suggested that antibiotic treatment of male partners could re-establish the normal microbiota of the male urogenital tract and prevent the recurrence of infection. However, a 2016 Cochrane review found high-quality evidence that treating the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis had no effect on symptoms, clinical outcomes, or recurrence in the affected women. It also found that such treatment may lead treated sexual partners to report increased adverse events.

==Treatment==
===Antibiotics===
Treatment is typically with the antibiotics metronidazole or clindamycin. They can be either given by mouth or applied inside the vagina with similar efficacy. Other antibiotics related to metronidazole, including tinidazole and the newer secnidazole, are also approved and used to treat BV. When clindamycin is given to pregnant women symptomatic with BV before 22 weeks of gestation the risk of pre-term birth before 37 weeks of gestation is lower. Additional antibiotics that are not approved for treatment of BV but might work include macrolides, lincosamides, and penicillins.

Although antibiotics are effective, about 10% to 15% of people do not improve with the first course of antibiotics and recurrence rates of up to 80% have been documented. Recurrence rates are increased with sexual activity with the same pre-/post-treatment partner and inconsistent condom use.

BV is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, and antibiotic treatment of a male sexual partner of a woman with BV is not recommended.

===Antiseptics===
Topical antiseptics, for example dequalinium chloride, policresulen, hexetidine, povidone-iodine, or boric acid vaginal suppositories may be applied, if the risk of ascending infections is low (outside of pregnancy and in immunocompetent people without histories of upper genital tract infections).

Dequalinium chloride is available as a prescription vaginal tablet, for instance in Europe and Canada, is given as a 6-day course, and is non-inferior to metronidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Povidone-iodine is approved as a vaginal gel to treat bacterial vaginosis under the brand name Astrodimer, among others. One study found that vaginal irrigations with hydrogen peroxide (3%) resulted in a slight improvement, but this was much less than with the use of oral metronidazole. Dequalinium chloride and povidone-iodine (as Astrodimer) have the best evidence of effectiveness. Neither of these are available in the United States, though they are available in other countries. Intravaginal boric acid, alone or in conjunction with other medications, may be helpful in the treatment of recurrent BV.

TOL-463, an experimental formulation of boric acid enhanced with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), is under development as an intravaginal medication for the treatment of BV and has shown preliminary effectiveness in clinical trials.

===Probiotics===
A 2009 Cochrane review found tentative but insufficient evidence for probiotics as a treatment for BV. A 2014 review reached the same conclusion. A 2013 review found some evidence supporting the use of probiotics during pregnancy. The preferred probiotics for BV are those containing high doses of lactobacilli (around 109 ) given in the vagina. Intravaginal administration is preferred to taking them by mouth. Prolonged repetitive courses of treatment appear to be more promising than short courses.

The lack of effectiveness of commercially available &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; probiotics may be because most do not actually contain vaginal lactobacilli strains. LACTIN-V is a live biopharmaceutical medication containing the vaginally important &quot;Lactobacillus crispatus&quot; which is under development for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and recurrent urinary tract infections. It has shown initial effectiveness in considerably reducing recurrence of bacterial vaginosis following antibiotic treatment. LACTIN-V is not yet Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or commercially available.

===Miscellaneous===
Estrogen-containing contraceptives have been found to decrease recurrence of BV.

==Epidemiology==
BV is the most common infection of the vagina in women of reproductive age. The percentage of women affected at any given time varies between 5% and 70%. BV is most common in parts of Africa, and least common in Asia and Europe. In the United States, about 30% of those between the ages of 14 and 49 are affected. Rates vary considerably between ethnic groups within a country.

<doc id="4582" wikidata="Q2927496" url="?curid=4582" title="Bud Selig">
<text>Allan Huber &quot;Bud&quot; Selig (; born July 30, 1934) is an American baseball executive who currently serves as the commissioner emeritus of baseball. Previously, he served as the ninth commissioner of baseball from 1998 to 2015. He initially served as de facto acting commissioner beginning in 1992 in his capacity as chairman of the Major League Baseball (MLB) Executive Committee before being named the official commissioner in 1998. Selig oversaw baseball through the 1994 strike, the introduction of the wild card, interleague play, and the de facto merging of the National and American Leagues under the Office of the Commissioner. He was instrumental in organizing the World Baseball Classic in 2006. Selig also introduced revenue sharing. He is credited for the financial turnaround of baseball during his tenure with a 400 percent increase in the revenue of MLB and annual record breaking attendance.

During Selig&#x27;s term of service, the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs became a public issue. The Mitchell Report, commissioned by Selig, concluded that the MLB commissioners, club officials, the Players Association, and the players all share &quot;to some extent in the responsibility for the steroid era.&quot; Following the release of the Mitchell Report, Congressman Cliff Stearns called publicly for Selig to step down as commissioner, citing his &quot;glacial response&quot; to the &quot;growing stain on baseball.&quot; Selig has pledged on numerous occasions to rid baseball of performance-enhancing drugs, and has overseen and instituted many rule changes and penalties to that end.

A Milwaukee native, Selig was previously the owner and team president of the Milwaukee Brewers. The franchise, originally known as the Seattle Pilots, was acquired by Selig in bankruptcy court in 1970, and renamed after the minor league team of the same name that he had watched in his youth and had existed until the arrival of the Braves in Milwaukee in 1953. Selig was credited with keeping baseball in Milwaukee. The Brewers went to the 1982 World Series (but were defeated in seven games by the St. Louis Cardinals), and Selig won seven Organization of the Year awards during his tenure. Selig remains a resident of Milwaukee.

On January 17, 2008, Selig&#x27;s contract was extended through 2012, after which he planned to retire, but he then decided to stay as commissioner until the end of the 2014 season, a move approved by the owners on January 12, 2012, which would take his leadership past his 80th birthday. Selig made $14.5 million in the 12-month period ending October 31, 2005. Selig announced on September 26, 2013, that he would retire in January 2015. On January 22, 2015, MLB announced that Selig would formally step down from the office when his current term expired on January 24, 2015. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2017.

== Early life ==
Selig was born in Milwaukee, and grew up in a Jewish family. His father, Ben Selig, had come to the United States from Romania with his family when he was four years old. Selig graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a B.A. in American history and political science in 1956. He served two years in the U.S. Army before working with his father who owned a car leasing business in Milwaukee. Selig continues to be involved in the automotive industry, serving as president of the Selig Executive Lease Company.

Selig&#x27;s interest in baseball came from his mother. An immigrant from Ukraine, Marie Selig attended college, a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early 20th century, and became a school teacher. When Selig was only three, Marie began taking him and his older brother, Jerry, to Borchert Field, where the minor league Milwaukee Brewers played. When the Boston Braves relocated to Milwaukee in 1953, Selig switched allegiances, and eventually became the team&#x27;s largest public stockholder. Selig was devastated when he learned that the Braves were going to leave Milwaukee in favor of Atlanta. In 1965, when the Braves left Milwaukee, he divested his stock in the team. As a youngster, Selig&#x27;s favorite player was Hershel Martin. He developed a friendship with Hank Aaron, when the young player joined the Braves. The elder Selig&#x27;s company provided loaner cars to Braves players, which gave the family access to the clubhouse and players. Selig and Aaron attended Green Bay Packers games together and sat together on the Brave&#x27;s plane.

== Milwaukee Brewers owner ==
As a minority owner of the Milwaukee Braves, Selig founded the organization Teams, Inc., in an attempt to prevent the majority owners (based out of Chicago) from moving the club to a larger television market. This was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations (in the modern era) left a city without a team. Prior movements had all originated in cities that were home to at least two teams. When his quest to keep the team in Milwaukee finally failed after the 1965 season, he changed the group&#x27;s name to Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc., after the minor league baseball team he grew up watching, and devoted himself to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.

Selig arranged for major league games to be played at Milwaukee County Stadium. The first, a pre-season match-up between the Chicago White Sox and Minnesota Twins, drew more than 51,000 spectators. Selig followed this up by hosting nine White Sox regular-season games in 1968 and eleven in 1969. One of the games played in Milwaukee that year was against the expansion Seattle Pilots, the team that would become the Brewers. Those Milwaukee &quot;home&quot; games were phenomenally successful, with the handful of games accounting for about &quot;one-third&quot; of total White Sox home attendance.

To satisfy that fan base, Selig decided to purchase the White Sox (with the intention of moving them to Milwaukee) in 1969. He entered into an agreement to buy the club, but the American League vetoed the sale, preferring to keep an American League team in Chicago, which at the time was still America&#x27;s second-largest city. Selig turned his attention to other franchises.

In 1970, he purchased the bankrupt Seattle Pilots franchise, moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the &quot;Brewers&quot;.

During Selig&#x27;s tenure as club president, the Brewers participated in postseason play in 1981, when the team finished first in the American League East during the second half of the season, and in 1982, when the team made it to the World Series, under the leadership of future Hall of Famers Robin Yount and Paul Molitor. Under Selig&#x27;s watch, the Brewers also won seven Organization of the Year awards. Selig was part of the owners&#x27; collusion in 1985–1987, resulting in the owners paying US$280 million in damages to the players.

Upon his assumption of the commissioner&#x27;s role, Selig transferred his ownership interest in the Brewers to his daughter Wendy Selig-Prieb in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest, though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations. Although the team was sold to Los Angeles investor Mark Attanasio in 2005, questions remain regarding Selig&#x27;s past involvement. Selig&#x27;s defenders point to the poor management of the team after Selig-Prieb took control as proof that Selig was not working behind the scenes.

Selig was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.

On August 24, 2010, a statue of Selig, the &quot;Selig Monument&quot;, commissioned by Brewers owner Mark Attanasio and designed by artist Brian Maughan, was unveiled outside Miller Park in Milwaukee.

== Acting Commissioner (1992–1998) ==
Selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of Commissioner Fay Vincent, and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal. Selig has never stated that the owners colluded, while Vincent has:

Following an 18-9 no-confidence vote, Vincent resigned. Selig had by this time become chairman of the Executive Council of Major League Baseball, and as such became de facto acting commissioner.

His first major act was to institute the Wild Card and divisional playoff play, which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans. Those against the Wild Card see it as diminishing the importance of the pennant race and the regular season, with the true race often being for second rather than first place, while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a first-place finish in their division, thus maintaining fan interest later in the season.

Selig suspended Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott for a year in 1993 for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions. The same year, Selig reinstated New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by Selig&#x27;s predecessor Fay Vincent. Pete Rose has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration. Rose, along with his close friend and former teammate Mike Schmidt (who is a strong supporter of Rose&#x27;s reinstatement into baseball), met with Selig in 2002, where Rose privately admitted to Selig (two years before going public with his admission) about betting on baseball. Bud Selig was a close friend of the late Bart Giamatti, who was the commissioner when Rose was first banned from the sport in 1989.

As acting commissioner, Selig represented MLB owners during the 1994 strike. On September 15, he cancelled the World Series, marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since 1904.

While serving as acting commissioner, MLB also implemented interleague play in 1997. 

== Commissioner (1998–2015) ==

After a six-year search for a new commissioner, the owners voted to give Selig the title on a permanent basis on July 9, 1998.

During his tenure, MLB avoided additional work stoppages by adopting collective bargaining agreements with its players in 2002 and 2006.

Whereas in the past, the National and American leagues had separate administrative organizations (which, for example, allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the designated hitter), under Selig, Major League Baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the Commissioner&#x27;s Office in 2000. The last official presidents of the NL and AL were Leonard S. Coleman Jr. and Dr. Gene Budig respectively.

=== Reaction after September 11, 2001 ===

On September 11, 2001, Selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the terror attacks on New York and Washington. The games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims, but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players.

===2001 contraction attempt===

After the conclusion of the 2001 World Series, Selig held a vote on contracting two teams, reportedly the Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos. This action led to Selig (along with former Expos owner Jeffrey Loria) being sued for racketeering and conspiring with Loria to deliberately defraud the Expos minority owners. If found liable, the league could have been ordered to pay as much as $500 million in total damages. The judge ruled that the Expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over. The case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

A week after Selig&#x27;s announcement, Hennepin County Judge Harry Seymour Crump issued a temporary restraining order that forced the Twins to honor their lease and play the 2002 season at the Metrodome. In August 2002, the effort to contract the Twins officially fizzled as players and owners reached a consensus on a new labor agreement which extended the team&#x27;s Metrodome lease.

=== Changes to the MLB All-Star Game ===

The 2002 All-Star Game, played in Selig&#x27;s hometown of Milwaukee, was tied 7–7 after nine innings, and remained tied after the bottom of the 11th inning. Due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings, both managers had used their entire roster. Concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound, Selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie, to the dissatisfaction of the Milwaukee fans. Selig later said that this call was &quot;embarrassing&quot; and that he was &quot;tremendously saddened&quot; by the outcome of the game.

Selig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the All-Star Game by awarding the winning league home-field advantage in the World Series; that practice was initiated in 2003 and continued through 2016. The 2003 All-Star Game had the same U.S. viewership as 2002 (9.5 rating; 17 share) and the ratings declined in 2004 (8.8 rating; 15 share) and 2005 (8.1 rating; 14 share). The American television audience increased in 2006 (9.3 rating; 16 share).

=== Disciplinary actions ===

On July 1, 2005, Selig suspended Texas Rangers pitcher Kenny Rogers for 20 games and fined him US$50,000. The punishment stemmed from an incident on June 29, 2005, during a Rangers pre-game warmup session, where Rogers had shoved two local news reporters and knocked one camera to the ground. One of the reporters resumed filming after picking up said camera, which angered Rogers into shoving him again, after grabbing and throwing the camera to the ground, kicking it. He was then led away by a teammate and later sent home by the club. While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the 2005 All-Star Game in Detroit, where fans loudly booed him. On July 22, 2005, Selig heard Rogers&#x27; appeal of his suspension. Selig decided to uphold the 20 games, however, an independent arbitrator ruled that Selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to 13 games, but upheld the fine.

=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===
In 2005, Selig faced Congress on the issue of steroids. After the Congressional hearings in early 2005, and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue, Selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performance-enhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system. This proposal also included the banning of amphetamines, a first for the major North American sports leagues. The MLB Players Association and MLB reached an agreement in November on the new policy.

Selig&#x27;s testimony on the subject has been contradictory. In 2005, Selig told reporters, &quot;I never even heard about them [steroids] until 1998 or 1999. I ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and I never heard any comment from them. It wasn&#x27;t until 1998 or &#x27;99 that I heard the discussion.&quot; But a year later, testifying to Congress in 2006, Selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early: &quot;In 1994, before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball, we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the MLBPA. As early as 1998, I began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing substances from the game.&quot; During the 1988 ALCS, Oakland&#x27;s Jose Canseco had been repeatedly taunted by Boston fans with a chant of &quot;ster-oids, ster-oids, ster-oids.&quot; Speaking at the 2013 All-Star Game, Selig complained, &quot;People say, &#x27;Well, you were slow to react.&#x27; We were not slow to react. In fact, I heard that this morning, and it aggravated me all over again.&quot;

By early 2006, Selig was forced to deal with the issue of steroid use. On March 30, 2006, as a response to the controversy of the use of performance-enhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by Barry Bonds, Selig asked former U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseball&#x27;s recent past. Joe Sheehan from &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot; wrote that the commission has been focusing &quot;blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel&quot;, and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management.

Much controversy surrounded Selig and his involvement in Bonds&#x27; all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig and the possibility that he and Henry Aaron would not attend Bonds&#x27; games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds&#x27; record-tying home run against the San Diego Padres, sitting in Padres owner John Moores&#x27; private suite. When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds&#x27; accomplishment, instead choosing to keep his hands in his pockets and have a look of disdain on his face. Bud Selig also did not attend the San Francisco Giants&#x27; game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run against the Washington Nationals; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.

On December 13, 2007, former senator Mitchell released his report on the use of performance-enhancing substances by MLB players. The report names many current and former players who allegedly used performance-enhancing drugs during their careers.

Selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; columnist Jay Mariotti called Selig the &quot;Steroids Commissioner.&quot; Selig has been called to Congress several times to testify on performance-enhancing drug use. Congressman Cliff Stearns said in December 2007 that Selig should resign because of use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure.

=== Post-season schedule ===
Selig&#x27;s decision to extend the traditional post-season schedule into November in an attempt to increase Nielsen ratings was met with widespread disdain, both inside and outside the baseball community. Mike Scioscia, manager of the American League West Division Champion Los Angeles Angels, dismissed the decision as &quot;Ridiculous. I don&#x27;t know. Can I say it any clearer than that? We should have never had a day off last Wednesday. We should never have three days off after the season. You shouldn&#x27;t even have two days off after the season.&quot;

=== Controversies ===
Selig has been embroiled in a number of controversial decisions during his tenure as commissioner. Notably, he has been accused of favoring the Milwaukee Brewers, his former team, such as he was during the 2001 contraction controversy when it was suggested the Minnesota Twins be one of two teams (the other being the Montreal Expos) to be contracted for economic reasons. Sportswriter Rob Dibble posted an open letter to Bud Selig, criticizing the plan for benefiting only the Brewers, noting that the contraction of the Twins would benefit the Brewers, as they would potentially claim the Twins&#x27; share of the upper Midwest market.

During the 2011 Los Angeles Dodgers ownership dispute, he was accused of not acting in good faith towards and treating the Dodgers differently from other teams when he rejected the television deal that Frank McCourt negotiated that intended to bring the franchise out of bankruptcy, claiming McCourt violated the Baseball Agreement. In comparison, no action was taken against New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon despite being in a similar position. United States bankruptcy judge Kevin Gross rendered a stern warning to Selig, stating: &quot;Should the Commissioner falter in proving alleged wrongdoing, the Court may allow LAD (Los Angeles Dodgers) to take further, limited discovery.&quot; Some critics have used Selig&#x27;s handling of the Dodgers to point out a double standard in treatment of MLB owners. More specifically in regards to the Mets, critics have accused Selig of favoritism towards the Mets due to Selig&#x27;s personal relationship with Wilpon, claiming that it motivated him to stall any possible removal of Wilpon as that club&#x27;s principal owner.

Selig also notably failed to resolve a 6-year conflict between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics regarding the Athletics&#x27; proposed move to San Jose. Selig established a blue-ribbon panel in 2009 to resolve the dispute; however, despite years to find a resolution, the blue-ribbon panel completely failed to make any progress toward resolving the issue, leading San Jose to sue MLB. The lawsuit, which is currently ongoing, questions the league&#x27;s anti-trust exemption and its ability to enforce particular clubs&#x27; geographic territories. In addition, he blocked the sale of the Athletics in 1999 to an ownership group led by Bob Piccinini, then the CEO of Save Mart Supermarkets, and Joe Lacob, who would later purchase Golden State Warriors, from purchasing the Athletics in 2005. Both potential ownership groups were committed to keeping the team in Oakland that would render this territorial dispute meaningless. Instead, Selig permitted only Lew Wolff, his fraternity brother from college, and John J. Fisher to buy the team. The latter has since initiated the process to move the Athletics from Oakland to Las Vegas.

=== Term of service ===

On December 1, 2006, Selig announced that he would be retiring as commissioner of baseball upon the expiration of his contract in 2009. Selig earned $14.5 million from MLB over the timespan October 31, 2005 to October 31, 2006. However, in January 2008, Selig agreed to a three-year contract extension, announcing he planned to retire after the 2012 season. He further decided against retirement, and after a two-year extension for the previous deal was agreed to on January 12, 2012, it was announced that Selig would remain commissioner until the end of the 2014 season.

===Post-Commissioner Activities===
In 2021, Selig was appointed as &quot;non-voting co-Chair&quot; (with Jane Forbes Clark) for the December 2021 Early Baseball Era Committee meeting, to consider candidates for election to the Hall of Fame whose major contributions to the game took place prior to 1950. The committee elected Bud Fowler and Buck O&#x27;Neil.

== Israel Baseball League ==

Selig and his family served a supportive role on the advisory board of the Israel Baseball League during its inaugural season in 2007. In response to issues with the league&#x27;s financial management, after the season, the Selig family requested that their names be removed from the list of board members.

==&quot;Selig Experience&quot;==
In May 2015, the Milwaukee Brewers honored Bud Selig with the unveiling of the &quot;Selig Experience&quot; exhibit at American Family Field (formerly Miller Park.) The &quot;Selig Experience&quot; is a fifteen-minute documentary showing Bud Selig&#x27;s life and work for the Milwaukee Brewers.

== Personal life ==
Selig has been married twice. He married his first wife, Donna Chaimson, in the 1950s, and they had two daughters: Sari (born 1957) and Wendy (born 1960). The couple divorced in 1976 after 19 years of marriage on the grounds that Selig had been &quot;unduly absenting yourself from the home of the parties and isolating yourself ... in pursuit of your baseball interests to the detriment of your marriage.&quot; Chaimson later stated that
the marriage ended because her husband &quot;divorced me and married baseball.&quot; Since 1977, Selig has been married to the former Suzanne Steinman, who has a daughter from a previous marriage.

== Teaching ==
In 2009, Selig began teaching as an adjunct professor of sports law and policy at Marquette University Law School. His classes have covered numerous topics, including &quot;the history of collective bargaining and free agency, baseball&#x27;s antitrust exemption, revenue sharing – as well as finer points of sports law like intellectual property rights, ambush marketing, and why baseball does not allow game footage on YouTube.&quot;

In 2010, Selig endowed the Allan H. Selig Chair in the History of Sport and Society in the United States, as well as a Distinguished Lecture Series in Sport and Society at his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin. The inaugural lecture was given by Adrian Burgos. Selig has since endowed two more chairs in the university&#x27;s history department.

In February 2016, Selig began teaching at the Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor College of Law at Arizona State University. His title at the law school is distinguished professor of sports in America. He is also a lecturer at UW–Madison and Marquette.

==Honors==

Selig was awarded the U.S. Department of the Army Outstanding Civilian Service Award in April 2015 for supporting soldiers, veterans, and their families through his work in Major League Baseball. On April 6, 2015, the Milwaukee Brewers retired uniform number 1 in his honor.

In 2014, Selig was inducted onto the inaugural Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor.

On December 4, 2016, it was announced Selig was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2017. He was formally inducted on July 30, 2017.

In 2016, Selig was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Coach Lombardi&#x27;s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the Coach.

<text>A bison (: bison) is a large bovine in the genus Bison (Greek: &quot;wild ox&quot; (bison)) within the tribe Bovini. Two extant and numerous extinct species are recognised.

Of the two surviving species, the American bison, &quot;B. bison&quot;, found only in North America, is the more numerous. Although colloquially referred to as a buffalo in the United States and Canada, it is only distantly related to the true buffalo. The North American species is composed of two subspecies, the Plains bison, &quot;B. b. bison&quot;, and the generally more northern wood bison, &quot;B. b. athabascae&quot;. A third subspecies, the eastern bison (&quot;B. b. pennsylvanicus&quot;) is no longer considered a valid taxon, being a junior synonym of &quot;B. b. bison&quot;. Historical references to &quot;woods bison&quot; or &quot;wood bison&quot; from the Eastern United States refer to this synonym animal (and to their eastern woodland habitat), not to &quot;B. b. athabascae&quot;, which was not found in the region. Its European kind &quot;B. bonasus&quot; or wisent —also &#x27;zubr&#x27; or colloquially &#x27;European buffalo&#x27;— is found in Europe and the Caucasus, reintroduced after being extinct in the wild.

While bison species have been traditionally classified in their own genus, modern genetics indicates that they are nested within the genus &quot;Bos,&quot; which includes, among others, cattle, yaks and gaur, being most closely related to yaks.

==Description==
The American bison and the European bison (wisent) are the largest surviving terrestrial animals in North America and Europe. They are typical artiodactyl (cloven hooved) ungulates, and are similar in appearance to other bovines such as cattle and true buffalo. They are broad and muscular with shaggy coats of long hair. Adults grow up to in height and in length for American bison and up to in height and in length for European bison. American bison can weigh from around and European bison can weigh from . European bison tend to be taller than American bison.

Bison are nomadic grazers and travel in herds. The bulls leave the herds of females at two or three years of age, and join a herd of males, which usually are smaller than female herds. Mature bulls rarely travel alone. Towards the end of the summer, for the reproductive season, the sexes necessarily commingle.

American bison are known for living in the Great Plains, but formerly had a much larger range, including much of the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. Both species were hunted close to extinction during the 19th and 20th centuries, but have since rebounded. The wisent in part owes its survival to the Chernobyl disaster, as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a kind of wildlife preserve for wisent and other rare megafauna such as the Przewalski&#x27;s horse, though poaching has become a threat in the 21st century. The American Plains bison is no longer listed as endangered, but this does not mean the species is secure. Genetically pure &quot;B. b. bison&quot; currently number only about 20,000, separated into fragmented herds—all of which require active conservation measures. The wood bison is on the endangered species list in Canada and is listed as threatened in the United States, though numerous attempts have been made by beefalo ranchers to have it entirely removed from the Endangered Species List.

Although superficially similar, physical and behavioural differences exist between the American and European bison. The American species has 15 ribs, while the European bison has 14. The American bison has four lumbar vertebrae, while the European has five. (The difference in this case is that what would be the first lumbar vertebra has ribs attached to it in American bison and is thus counted as the 15th thoracic vertebra, compared to 14 thoracic vertebrae in wisent.) Adult American bison are less slim in build and have shorter legs. American bison tend to graze more, and browse less than their European relatives. Their anatomies reflect this behavioural difference; the American bison&#x27;s head hangs lower than the European&#x27;s. The body of the American bison is typically hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point through the plane of their faces, making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison, which favours butting. American bison are more easily tamed than their European cousins, and breed with domestic cattle more readily.

==Evolution and genetic history==
The bovine tribe (Bovini) split about 5 to 10 million years ago into the buffalos (&quot;Bubalus&quot; and &quot;Syncerus&quot;) and a group leading to bison and taurine cattle. Genetic evidence from nuclear DNA indicates that the closest living relatives of bison are yaks, with bison being nested within the genus &quot;Bos,&quot; rendering &quot;Bos&quot; without including bison paraphyletic. While nuclear DNA indicates that both extant bison species are each other&#x27;s closest living relatives, the mitochondrial DNA of European bison is more closely related to that of domestic cattle and aurochs (while the mitochondrial DNA of American bison is closely related to that of yaks). This discrepancy is either suggested to be the result of incomplete lineage sorting or ancient introgression. Bison are widely believed to have evolved from a lineage belonging to the extinct genus &quot;Leptobos&quot; during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene in Asia. The earliest members of the bison lineage, known from the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene of the Indian Subcontinent (&quot;Bison sivalensis&quot;) and China (&quot;Bison palaeosinensis&quot;), approximately 3.4-2.6 million years ago (Ma) are placed in the subgenus &quot;Bison&quot; (&quot;Eobison&quot;)&quot;.&quot; The oldest remains of &quot;Eobison&quot; in Europe are those &quot;Bison georgicus&quot; found in Dmanisi, Georgia, dated to around 1.76 Ma. More derived members of the genus are placed in the subgenus &quot;Bison&quot; (&quot;Bison&quot;), which first appeared towards the end of the Early Pleistocene, around 1.2 Ma, with early members of the subgenus including the widespread &quot;Bison schoetensacki&quot;.

The steppe bison (&quot;Bison priscus&quot;) first appeared during the mid-Middle Pleistocene in eastern Eurasia, and subsequently became widely distributed across Eurasia. During the late Middle Pleistocene, around 195,000-135,000 years ago, the steppe bison migrated across the Bering land bridge into North America, becoming ancestral to North American bison species, including the large &quot;Bison latifrons,&quot; and the smaller &quot;Bison antiquus,&quot; which became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene. Modern American bison are thought to have evolved from &quot;B. antiquus&quot; during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition via the intermediate form &quot;Bison occidentalis&quot;. The European bison, &quot;Bison bonasus,&quot; first appeared in Europe during the late Middle Pleistocene, where it existed in sympatry with the steppe bison. Its relationship with other extinct bison species is unclear, though it appears to be only distantly related to the steppe and American bisons, with possibly some interbreeding between the two lineages during the Middle Pleistocene. The steppe bison survived into the early-mid Holocene in Alaska-Yukon and eastern Siberia, before becoming extinct.

Prior to the late 19th century, the population of American bison likely numbered in the tens of millions, perhaps as many as 60 million. During the population bottleneck caused by the great slaughter of American bison during the 19th century, the number of bison remaining alive in North America declined to as low as 541. During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce &quot;cattleo&quot; (today called &quot;beefalo&quot;). Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with bison cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. Wisent-American bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in Germany (and found to be fully fertile) and a herd of such animals is maintained in Russia. A herd of cattle-wisent crossbreeds (zubron) is maintained in Poland. First-generation crosses do not occur naturally, requiring caesarean delivery. First-generation males are infertile. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics that prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species. In the United States, many ranchers are now using DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%.

There are also remnant purebred American bison herds on public lands in North America. Two subspecies of bison exist in North America: the &quot;plains bison&quot; and the &quot;wood bison&quot;. Herds of importance are found in Yellowstone National Park, Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, Blue Mounds State Park in Minnesota, Elk Island National Park in Alberta, and Grasslands National Park in Saskatchewan. In 2015, a purebred herd of 350 individuals was identified on public lands in the Henry Mountains of southern Utah via genetic testing of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. This study, published in 2015, also showed the Henry Mountains bison herd to be free of brucellosis, a bacterial disease that was imported with non-native domestic cattle to North America.

In 2021, the American Society of Mammalogists considered &quot;Bison&quot; to be a subgenus, and placed both bison species back into &quot;Bos&quot;.

==Behavior==
Wallowing is a common behavior of bison. A &quot;bison wallow&quot; is a shallow depression in the soil, either wet or dry. Bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with mud or dust. Possible explanations suggested for wallowing behavior include grooming behavior associated with moulting, male-male interaction (typically rutting behavior), social behavior for group cohesion, play behavior, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of ectoparasite load (ticks and lice), and thermoregulation. In the process of wallowing, bison may become infected by the fatal disease anthrax, which may occur naturally in the soil.

Bison temperament is often unpredictable. They usually appear peaceful, unconcerned, or even lazy, but they may attack without warning or apparent reason. They can move at speeds up to and cover long distances at a lumbering gallop.

Their most obvious weapons are the horns borne by both males and females, but their massive heads can be used as battering rams, effectively using the momentum produced by what is a typical weight of moving at . The hind legs can also be used to kill or maim with devastating effect. In the words of early naturalists, they were dangerous, savage animals that feared no other animal and in prime condition could best any foe except for a brown bear or a pack of wolves.

The rutting, or mating, season lasts from June through September, with peak activity in July and August. At this time, the older bulls rejoin the herd, and fights often take place between bulls. The herd exhibits much restlessness during breeding season. The animals are belligerent, unpredictable, and most dangerous.

==Habitat==

American bison live in river valleys and on prairies and plains. Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison. They also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep. Although not particularly known as high-altitude animals, bison in the Yellowstone Park bison herd are frequently found at elevations above . The Henry Mountains bison herd is found on the plains around the Henry Mountains, Utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the Henry Mountains to an altitude of .

European bison most commonly live in lightly wooded to fully wooded areas as well as areas with increased shrubs and bushes. European bison can sometimes be found living on grasslands and plains as well.

===Restrictions===
Throughout most of their historical range, landowners have sought restrictions on free-ranging bison. Herds on private land are required to be fenced in.

In the state of Montana, free-ranging bison on public land are legally shot, due to transmission of disease to cattle and damage to public property.

In 2013, Montana legislative measures concerning the bison were proposed and passed, but opposed by Native American tribes as they impinged on sovereign tribal rights. Three such bills were vetoed by Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana. The bison&#x27;s circumstances remain an issue of contention between Native American tribes and private landowners.

==Diet==

Bison are ruminants, able to ferment cellulose in a specialized stomach prior to digestion. Bison were once thought to almost exclusively consume grasses and sedges, but are now known to consume a wide-variety of plants including woody plants and herbaceous eudicots. Over the course of the year, bison shift which plants they select in their diet based on which plants have the highest protein or energy concentrations at a given time and will reliably consume the same species of plants across years. Protein concentrations of the plants they eat tend to be highest in the spring and decline thereafter, reaching their lowest in the winter. In Yellowstone National Park, bison browsed willows and cottonwoods, not only in the winter when few other plants are available, but also in the summer. Bison are thought to migrate to optimize their diet, and will concentrate their feeding on recently burned areas due to the higher quality forage that regrows after the burn. Wisent tend to browse on shrubs and low-hanging trees more often than do the American bison, which prefer grass to shrubbery and trees.

== Reproduction ==

Female bison (&quot;cows&quot;) typically reproduce after three years of age and can continue beyond 19 years of age. Cows produce calves annually as long as their nutrition is sufficient, but not after years when weight gain is low. Reproduction is dependent on a cow&#x27;s mass and age. Heavier cows produce heavier calves (weighed in the fall at weaning), and weights of calves are lower for older cows (after age 8).

==Predators==

Owing to their size, bison have few predators. Five exceptions are humans, grey wolves, cougars, grizzly bears, and coyotes. Wolves generally take down a bison while in a pack, but cases of a single wolf killing bison have been reported. Grizzly bears also consume bison, often by driving off the pack and consuming the wolves&#x27; kill. Grizzly bears and coyotes also prey on bison calves. Historically and prehistorically, lions, cave lions, tigers, dire wolves, &quot;Smilodon&quot;, &quot;Homotherium&quot;, cave hyenas, and Neanderthals posed threats to bison.

==Infections and illness==
For American bison, a main illness is malignant catarrhal fever, though brucellosis is a serious concern in the Yellowstone Park bison herd.&lt;ref name=&quot;billingsgazette/carcasses-yellowstone&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bison in the Antelope Island bison herd are regularly inoculated against brucellosis, parasites, &quot;Clostridium&quot; infection, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and bovine vibriosis.

The major illnesses in European bison are foot-and-mouth disease and balanoposthitis. Inbreeding of a small population plays a role in a number of genetic defects and lowers immunity to disease; that poses greater risk to the population.

== Name ==
The name &#x27;bison&#x27; was first used for the European species— ancient Greek authors Pausanias and Oppian in 2nd-century AD wrote about them in Greek as &quot;bisōn&quot;; so did Roman authors Pliny the Elder and Gaius Julius Solinus (as Latin ). The Germanic name &#x27;wisent&#x27; is a cognate, meaning that the two words share a common origin. The Latin was made into a genus name by Charles Hamilton Smith  in 1827.

Although called &quot;buffalo&quot; in American English, they are only distantly related to two &quot;true buffalo&quot;, the Asian water buffalo and the African buffalo. Samuel de Champlain applied the French term &quot;buffle&quot; to the bison in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the Nipissing First Nation, who said they travelled 40 days (from east of Lake Huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals. Though &quot;bison&quot; might be considered more scientifically correct, &quot;buffalo&quot; is also considered correct as a result of standard usage in American English, and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison. &quot;Buffalo&quot; has a much longer history than &quot;bison&quot;, which was first recorded in 1774.

==Bison and human culture==
Bison was a significant resource for indigenous peoples of North America for food and raw materials until near extinction in the late 19th century. For the indigenous peoples of the Plains, it was their principal food source. Native Americans highly valued their relationship with the bison and saw them as sacred, treating them respectfully to ensure their abundance and longevity. In his biography, Lakota teacher and elder John Fire Lame Deer describes the relationship as such:


European colonials were almost exclusively accountable for the near-extinction of the American bison in the 1800s. At the beginning of the century, tens of millions of bison roamed North America. Colonists slaughtered an estimated 50 million bison during the 19th century, although the causes of decline and the numbers killed are disputed and debated. Railroads were advertising &quot;hunting by rail&quot;, where trains encountered large herds alongside or crossing the tracks. Men aboard fired from the train&#x27;s roof or windows, leaving countless animals to rot where they died. This overhunting was in part motivated by the U.S. government&#x27;s desire to limit the range and power of indigenous plains Indians whose diets and cultures depended on the buffalo herds. The overhunting of the bison reduced their population to hundreds.

The American bison&#x27;s nadir came in 1889, with an estimated population of only 1,091 animals (both wild and captive). Repopulation attempts via enforced protection of government herds and extensive ranching began in 1910 and have continued (with excellent success) to the present day, with some caveats. Extensive farming has increased the bison&#x27;s population to nearly 150,000, and it is officially no longer considered an endangered species. However, from a genetic standpoint, most of these animals are actually hybrids with domestic cattle and only two populations in Yellowstone National Park in the United States and Elk Island National Park in Canada remain as genetically pure bison. These genetically pure animals account for only ~5% of the currently extant American bison population, reflecting the loss of most of the species&#x27; genetic diversity.

As of July 2015, an estimated 4,900 bison lived in Yellowstone National Park, the largest U.S. bison population on public land. During 1983–1985 visitors experienced 33 bison-related injuries (range = 10–13/year), so the park implemented education campaigns. After years of success, five injuries associated with bison encounters occurred in 2015, because visitors did not maintain the required distance of 75 ft (23 m) from bison while hiking or taking pictures.

==Nutrition==
Bison is an excellent source of complete protein and a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of multiple vitamins, including riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, and is also a rich source of minerals, including iron, phosphorus, and zinc. Additionally, bison is a good source (10% or more of the DV) of thiamine. 

==Livestock==

The earliest plausible accounts of captive bison are those of the zoo at Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, which held an animal the Spaniards called &quot;the Mexican bull&quot;. In 1552, Francisco Lopez de Gomara described Plains Indians herding and leading bison like cattle in his controversial book, &quot;Historia general de las Indias&quot;. Gomara, having never visited the Americas himself, likely misinterpreted early ethnographic accounts as the more familiar pastoralist relationship of the Old World. Today, bison are increasingly raised for meat, hides, and wool products. The majority of bison in the world are raised for human consumption or fur clothing. Bison meat is generally considered to taste very similar to beef, but is lower in fat and cholesterol, yet higher in protein than beef. A market even exists for kosher bison meat; these bison are slaughtered at one of the few kosher mammal slaughterhouses in the U.S. and Canada, and the meat is then distributed worldwide. Beefalo have been advertised as a hybrid breed between bison and cattle, but many beefalo, including the original pedigree founding herd of the breed, have no detectable bison ancestry.

In America, the commercial industry for bison has been slow to develop despite individuals, such as Ted Turner, who have long marketed bison meat. In the 1990s, Turner found limited success with restaurants for high-quality cuts of meat, which include bison steaks and tenderloin. Lower-quality cuts suitable for hamburger and hot dogs have been described as &quot;almost nonexistent&quot;. This created a marketing problem for commercial farming because the majority of usable meat, about 400 pounds for each bison, is suitable for these products. In 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture purchased $10 million worth of frozen overstock to save the industry, which would later recover through better use of consumer marketing. Restaurants have played a role in popularizing bison meat, like Ted&#x27;s Montana Grill, which added bison to their menus. Ruby Tuesday first offered bison on their menus in 2005.

In Canada, commercial bison farming began in the mid-1980s, concerning an unknown number of animals then. The first census of the bison occurred in 1996, which recorded 45,235 bison on 745 farms, and grew to 195,728 bison on 1,898 farms for the 2006 census.

Several pet food companies use bison as a red meat alternative in dog foods. The companies producing these formulas include Natural Balance Pet Foods, Freshpet, the Blue Buffalo Company, Solid Gold, Canidae, and Taste of the Wild (made by Diamond Pet Foods, Inc., owned by Schell and Kampeter, Inc.).

<doc id="4584" wikidata="Q159731" url="?curid=4584" title="Baryon">
<text>In particle physics, a baryon is a type of composite subatomic particle that contains an odd number of valence quarks, conventionally three. Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons; because baryons are composed of quarks, they belong to the hadron family of particles. Baryons are also classified as fermions because they have half-integer spin.

The name &quot;baryon&quot;, introduced by Abraham Pais, comes from the Greek word for &quot;heavy&quot; (βαρύς, &quot;barýs&quot;), because, at the time of their naming, most known elementary particles had lower masses than the baryons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle (antibaryon) where their corresponding antiquarks replace quarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.

Baryons participate in the residual strong force, which is mediated by particles known as mesons. The most familiar baryons are protons and neutrons, both of which contain three quarks, and for this reason they are sometimes called &quot;triquarks&quot;. These particles make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe and compose the nucleus of every atom (electrons, the other major component of the atom, are members of a different family of particles called leptons; leptons do not interact via the strong force). Exotic baryons containing five quarks, called pentaquarks, have also been discovered and studied.

A census of the Universe&#x27;s baryons indicates that 10% of them could be found inside galaxies, 50 to 60% in the , and the remaining 30 to 40% could be located in the warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).

== Background ==
Baryons are strongly interacting fermions; that is, they are acted on by the strong nuclear force and are described by Fermi–Dirac statistics, which apply to all particles obeying the Pauli exclusion principle. This is in contrast to the bosons, which do not obey the exclusion principle.

Baryons, alongside mesons, are hadrons, composite particles composed of quarks. Quarks have baryon numbers of &quot;B&quot; =  and antiquarks have baryon numbers of &quot;B&quot; = −. The term &quot;baryon&quot; usually refers to &quot;triquarks&quot;—baryons made of three quarks (&quot;B&quot; =  +  +  = 1).

Other exotic baryons have been proposed, such as pentaquarks—baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark (&quot;B&quot; =  +  +  +  −  = 1), but their existence is not generally accepted. The particle physics community as a whole did not view their existence as likely in 2006, and in 2008, considered evidence to be overwhelmingly against the existence of the reported pentaquarks. However, in July 2015, the LHCb experiment observed two resonances consistent with pentaquark states in the Λ → J/ψKp decay, with a combined statistical significance of 15σ.

In theory, heptaquarks (5 quarks, 2 antiquarks), nonaquarks (6 quarks, 3 antiquarks), etc. could also exist.

== Baryonic matter ==
Nearly all matter that may be encountered or experienced in everyday life is baryonic matter, which includes atoms of any sort, and provides them with the property of mass. Non-baryonic matter, as implied by the name, is any sort of matter that is not composed primarily of baryons. This might include neutrinos and free electrons, dark matter, supersymmetric particles, axions, and black holes.

The very existence of baryons is also a significant issue in cosmology because it is assumed that the Big Bang produced a state with equal amounts of baryons and antibaryons. The process by which baryons came to outnumber their antiparticles is called baryogenesis.

== Baryogenesis ==
Experiments are consistent with the number of quarks in the universe being conserved alongside the total baryon number, with antibaryons being counted as negative quantities. Within the prevailing Standard Model of particle physics, the number of baryons may change in multiples of three due to the action of sphalerons, although this is rare and has not been observed under experiment. Some grand unified theories of particle physics also predict that a single proton can decay, changing the baryon number by one; however, this has not yet been observed under experiment. The excess of baryons over antibaryons in the present universe is thought to be due to non-conservation of baryon number in the very early universe, though this is not well understood.

== Properties ==

=== Isospin and charge ===

The concept of isospin was first proposed by Werner Heisenberg in 1932 to explain the similarities between protons and neutrons under the strong interaction. Although they had different electric charges, their masses were so similar that physicists believed they were the same particle. The different electric charges were explained as being the result of some unknown excitation similar to spin. This unknown excitation was later dubbed &quot;isospin&quot; by Eugene Wigner in 1937.

This belief lasted until Murray Gell-Mann proposed the quark model in 1964 (containing originally only the u, d, and s quarks). The success of the isospin model is now understood to be the result of the similar masses of u and d quarks. Since u and d quarks have similar masses, particles made of the same number then also have similar masses. The exact specific u and d quark composition determines the charge, as u quarks carry charge + while d quarks carry charge −. For example, the four Deltas all have different charges ( (uuu), (uud), (udd), (ddd)), but have similar masses (~1,232 MeV/c2) as they are each made of a combination of three u or d quarks. Under the isospin model, they were considered to be a single particle in different charged states.

The mathematics of isospin was modeled after that of spin. Isospin projections varied in increments of 1 just like those of spin, and to each projection was associated a &quot;charged state&quot;. Since the &quot;Delta particle&quot; had four &quot;charged states&quot;, it was said to be of isospin &quot;I&quot; = . Its &quot;charged states&quot; , , , and , corresponded to the isospin projections &quot;I&quot;3 = +, &quot;I&quot;3 = +, &quot;I&quot;3 = −, and &quot;I&quot;3 = −, respectively. Another example is the &quot;nucleon particle&quot;. As there were two nucleon &quot;charged states&quot;, it was said to be of isospin . The positive nucleon (proton) was identified with &quot;I&quot;3 = + and the neutral nucleon (neutron) with &quot;I&quot;3 = −. It was later noted that the isospin projections were related to the up and down quark content of particles by the relation:
: formula_1
where the &quot;n&quot;&#x27;s are the number of up and down quarks and antiquarks.

In the &quot;isospin picture&quot;, the four Deltas and the two nucleons were thought to be the different states of two particles. However, in the quark model, Deltas are different states of nucleons (the N++ or N− are forbidden by Pauli&#x27;s exclusion principle). Isospin, although conveying an inaccurate picture of things, is still used to classify baryons, leading to unnatural and often confusing nomenclature.

=== Flavour quantum numbers ===
The strangeness flavour quantum number &quot;S&quot; (not to be confused with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb octets and decuplets. Since only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers works well only for octet and decuplet made of one u, one d, and one other quark, and breaks down for the other octets and decuplets (for example, ucb octet and decuplet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called &quot;symmetric&quot;, as they would all behave in the same way to the strong interaction. Since quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be broken.

It was noted that charge (&quot;Q&quot;) was related to the isospin projection (&quot;I&quot;3), the baryon number (&quot;B&quot;) and flavour quantum numbers (&quot;S&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;B&quot;′, &quot;T&quot;) by the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula:
: formula_2
where &quot;S&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;B&quot;′, and &quot;T&quot; represent the strangeness, charm, bottomness and topness flavour quantum numbers, respectively. They are related to the number of strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks and antiquark according to the relations:
: formula_3
meaning that the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula is equivalent to the expression of charge in terms of quark content:
: formula_4

=== Spin, orbital angular momentum, and total angular momentum ===

Spin (quantum number &quot;S&quot;) is a vector quantity that represents the &quot;intrinsic&quot; angular momentum of a particle. It comes in increments of  ħ (pronounced &quot;h-bar&quot;). The ħ is often dropped because it is the &quot;fundamental&quot; unit of spin, and it is implied that &quot;spin 1&quot; means &quot;spin 1 ħ&quot;. In some systems of natural units, ħ is chosen to be 1, and therefore does not appear anywhere.

Quarks are fermionic particles of spin (&quot;S&quot; = ). Because spin projections vary in increments of 1 (that is 1 ħ), a single quark has a spin vector of length , and has two spin projections (&quot;S&quot;z = + and &quot;S&quot;z = −). Two quarks can have their spins aligned, in which case the two spin vectors add to make a vector of length &quot;S&quot; = 1 and three spin projections (&quot;S&quot;z = +1, &quot;S&quot;z = 0, and &quot;S&quot;z = −1). If two quarks have unaligned spins, the spin vectors add up to make a vector of length &quot;S&quot; = 0 and has only one spin projection (&quot;S&quot;z = 0), etc. Since baryons are made of three quarks, their spin vectors can add to make a vector of length &quot;S&quot; = , which has four spin projections (&quot;S&quot;z = +, &quot;S&quot;z = +, &quot;S&quot;z = −, and &quot;S&quot;z = −), or a vector of length &quot;S&quot; =  with two spin projections (&quot;S&quot;z = +, and &quot;S&quot;z = −).

There is another quantity of angular momentum, called the orbital angular momentum (azimuthal quantum number &quot;L&quot;), that comes in increments of 1 ħ, which represent the angular moment due to quarks orbiting around each other. The total angular momentum (total angular momentum quantum number &quot;J&quot;) of a particle is therefore the combination of intrinsic angular momentum (spin) and orbital angular momentum. It can take any value from to , in increments of 1.
Particle physicists are most interested in baryons with no orbital angular momentum (&quot;L&quot; = 0), as they correspond to ground states—states of minimal energy. Therefore, the two groups of baryons most studied are the &quot;S&quot; = ; &quot;L&quot; = 0 and &quot;S&quot; = ; &quot;L&quot; = 0, which corresponds to &quot;J&quot; = + and &quot;J&quot; = +, respectively, although they are not the only ones. It is also possible to obtain &quot;J&quot; = + particles from &quot;S&quot; =  and &quot;L&quot; = 2, as well as &quot;S&quot; =  and &quot;L&quot; = 2. This phenomenon of having multiple particles in the same total angular momentum configuration is called &quot;degeneracy&quot;. How to distinguish between these degenerate baryons is an active area of research in baryon spectroscopy.

=== Parity ===
If the universe were reflected in a mirror, most of the laws of physics would be identical—things would behave the same way regardless of what we call &quot;left&quot; and what we call &quot;right&quot;. This concept of mirror reflection is called &quot;intrinsic parity&quot; or simply &quot;parity&quot; (&quot;P&quot;). Gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the strong interaction all behave in the same way regardless of whether or not the universe is reflected in a mirror, and thus are said to conserve parity (P-symmetry). However, the weak interaction does distinguish &quot;left&quot; from &quot;right&quot;, a phenomenon called parity violation (P-violation).

Based on this, if the wavefunction for each particle (in more precise terms, the quantum field for each particle type) were simultaneously mirror-reversed, then the new set of wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy the laws of physics (apart from the weak interaction). It turns out that this is not quite true: for the equations to be satisfied, the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by −1, in addition to being mirror-reversed. Such particle types are said to have negative or odd parity (&quot;P&quot; = −1, or alternatively &quot;P&quot; = –), while the other particles are said to have positive or even parity (&quot;P&quot; = +1, or alternatively &quot;P&quot; = +).

For baryons, the parity is related to the orbital angular momentum by the relation:
: formula_5

As a consequence, baryons with no orbital angular momentum (&quot;L&quot; = 0) all have even parity (&quot;P&quot; = +).

== Nomenclature ==
Baryons are classified into groups according to their isospin (&quot;I&quot;) values and quark (&quot;q&quot;) content. There are six groups of baryons: nucleon (), Delta (), Lambda (), Sigma (), Xi (), and Omega (). The rules for classification are defined by the Particle Data Group. These rules consider the up (), down () and strange () quarks to be &quot;light&quot; and the charm (), bottom (), and top () quarks to be &quot;heavy&quot;. The rules cover all the particles that can be made from three of each of the six quarks, even though baryons made of top quarks are not expected to exist because of the top quark&#x27;s short lifetime. The rules do not cover pentaquarks.
* Baryons with (any combination of) three and/or quarks are s (&quot;I&quot; = ) or baryons (&quot;I&quot; = ).
* Baryons containing two and/or quarks are baryons (&quot;I&quot; = 0) or baryons (&quot;I&quot; = 1). If the third quark is heavy, its identity is given by a subscript.
* Baryons containing one or quark are baryons (&quot;I&quot; = ). One or two subscripts are used if one or both of the remaining quarks are heavy.
* Baryons containing no or quarks are baryons (&quot;I&quot; = 0), and subscripts indicate any heavy quark content.
* Baryons that decay strongly have their masses as part of their names. For example, Σ0 does not decay strongly, but Δ++(1232) does.

It is also a widespread (but not universal) practice to follow some additional rules when distinguishing between some states that would otherwise have the same symbol.
* Baryons in total angular momentum &quot;J&quot; =  configuration that have the same symbols as their &quot;J&quot; =  counterparts are denoted by an asterisk ( * ).
* Two baryons can be made of three different quarks in &quot;J&quot; =  configuration. In this case, a prime ( ′ ) is used to distinguish between them.
** &quot;Exception&quot;: When two of the three quarks are one up and one down quark, one baryon is dubbed Λ while the other is dubbed Σ.

Quarks carry a charge, so knowing the charge of a particle indirectly gives the quark content. For example, the rules above say that a contains a c quark and some combination of two u and/or d quarks. The c quark has a charge of (&quot;Q&quot; = +), therefore the other two must be a u quark (&quot;Q&quot; = +), and a d quark (&quot;Q&quot; = −) to have the correct total charge (&quot;Q&quot; = +1).

<text>A braille embosser is an impact printer that renders text as tactile braille cells. Using braille translation software, a document or digital text can be embossed with relative ease. This makes braille production efficient and cost-effective. Braille translation software may be free and open-sourced or paid. Braille embossers can emboss single-sided or double-sided (called interpoint) and can produce 6- or 8-dot braille.

Blind users tend to call other printers &quot;ink printers,&quot; to distinguish them from their braille counterparts. This is often the case regardless of the type of printer being discussed (e.g., thermal printers being called &quot;ink printers&quot; even though they use no ink).

As with ink printers and presses, embossers range from those intended for consumers to those used by large publishers. The price of embossers increase with the volume of braille it produces .

== Types ==
The fastest industrial braille embosser is probably the $92,000 Belgian-made NV Interpoint 55, first produced in 1991, which uses a separate air compressor to drive the embossing head and can output up to 800 braille characters per second. Adoption was slow at first; in 2000 the National Federation of the Blind said there were only three of these in the US, one owned by the NFB itself and the other two by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. As of 2008, there are more than 60 in use across the world.

Smaller desktop braille embossers are more common and can be found in libraries, universities, and specialist education centers, as well as being privately owned by blind individuals. It may be necessary to use an acoustic cabinet or hood to dampen the noise level.

Braille embossers usually need special braille paper which is thicker and more expensive than normal paper. Some high-end embossers are capable of printing on normal paper. Embossers can be either one-sided or two-sided. Two-sided embossing requires lining up the dots so they do not overlap (called &quot;interpoint&quot; because the points on the other side are placed in between the points on the first side). Two-sided embossing uses less paper and reduces the size of the output.

Once one copy of a document has been produced, printing further copies is often quicker by means of a device called a thermoform, which produces copies on soft plastic. However, the resulting braille is not as easily readable as braille that has been freshly embossed, in much the same way that a poor-quality photocopy is not as readable as the original. Hence large publishers do not generally use thermoforms.

Some embossers can produce &quot;dotty Moon&quot;, i.e., Moon type shapes formed by dots.

<text>Basic Role-Playing (BRP) is a tabletop role-playing game which originated in the &quot;RuneQuest&quot; fantasy role-playing game. Chaosium released the &quot;BRP&quot; standalone booklet in 1980 in the boxed set release of the second edition of &quot;RuneQuest&quot;. Greg Stafford and Lynn Willis are credited as the authors. Chaosium used the percentile skill-based system as the basis for most of their games, including &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, and &quot;Elfquest&quot;.

== History ==
The core rules were written by Steve Perrin as part of his game &quot;RuneQuest&quot;. It was Greg Stafford&#x27;s idea to simplify the rules (eliminating such mechanics as Strike Ranks and Hit Locations) and issue them in a 16-page booklet called &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot;. Since the first &quot;BRP&quot; release, designers including Sandy Petersen, Lynn Willis, and Steve Henderson, have contributed to the system.

The system was notable for being the first role-playing game system to introduce a full skill system to characters regardless of their profession. This was developed in &quot;RuneQuest&quot; but was also later adopted by the more skill-oriented &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; RPG.

&quot;BRP&quot; was conceived of as a generic system. Specific rule systems for support differing genres could be added to the core rules in a modular fashion. In order to underscore this, in 1982 Chaosium released the &quot;Worlds of Wonder&quot; box set, which contained a revised main booklet and several booklets providing the additional rules for playing in specific genres. The superhero-themed &quot;Superworld&quot; originated as part of this set. A third edition of the core booklet, now entitled &quot;Basic Roleplaying: The Chaosium System&quot;, was released in 2002.

In 2004, Chaosium began publishing the &quot;Basic Roleplaying&quot; monographs, a series of paperback booklets. The first four monographs (&quot;Players Book&quot;, &quot;Magic Book&quot;, &quot;Creatures Book&quot;, and &quot;Gamemaster Book&quot;) was the same as &quot;RuneQuest&quot; 3rd Edition, but with trademarked elements removed, as Chaosium had lost the rights to the name but retained copyright to the rules text. Additional monographs allowing for new mechanics, thereby extending the system to other genres, were released in the following years. Many of these monographs reproduced rules from other Chaosium-published &quot;BRP&quot; games that had gone out of print.

Jason Durall and Sam Johnson gathered up previous works and updated them to a new edition. published in 2008. This comprehensive book, &quot;Basic Roleplaying: The Chaosium System&quot; nicknamed the &quot;Big Gold Book&quot;. It allowed game masters to build their own game out of the included subsystems. A quickstart booklet for new players accompanied it. In 2011, it was updated to a second edition.

In 2020, Chaosium released &quot;Basic Roleplaying&quot; as a System Reference Document (SRD).

A new edition, entitled &quot;Basic Roleplaying: Universal Game Engine&quot;, appeared in 2023, initially as a PDF and later as a hardbound book.

==Licensed adaptations== 
Preexisting RPG and fiction settings converted to the system by Chaosium using the &quot;BRP&quot; ruleset include &quot;Ringworld&quot;, &quot;Hawkmoon&quot;, and an adaptation of the French RPG &quot;Nephilim&quot;.

== Rules system ==
&quot;BRP&quot; is similar to other generic systems such as &quot;GURPS&quot;, &quot;Hero System&quot;, or &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; in that it uses a simple resolution method which can be broadly applied. It uses a core set of seven characteristics: Size, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Power, and Appearance or Charisma. From these, a character derives scores in various skills, expressed as percentages. These skill scores are the basis of play. When attempting an action, the player rolls percentile dice to attempt to get a result equal to or lower than the character&#x27;s skill score. Each incarnation of the &quot;BRP&quot; rules changed or added to the core ideas and mechanics, so that games are not identical. For example, in &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, skills may never be over 100%, while in &quot;Stormbringer&quot; skills in excess of 100% are within reach for all characters. Scores can increase through experience checks, the mechanics of which vary in an individual game.

The system treats armor and defense as separate: the act of parrying is a defensive skill that reduces an opponent&#x27;s chance to successfully land an attack, and the purpose of armor is to absorb damage.

In most &quot;BRP&quot; games there is no difference between the player character race systems and that of monsters or other opponents. By varying ability scores, the same system is used for a human hero as a troll villain. This approach allows for players to play a variety of nonhuman species.

== Adaptations of the system ==
Chaosium was an early adopter of licensing out its &quot;BRP&quot; system to other companies, something that was unique at the time they began but commonplace now thanks to the d20 licenses. This places &quot;BRP&quot; in the notable position of being one of the first products to allow other game companies to develop games or game aids for their work. For example, &quot;Other Suns&quot;, published by Fantasy Games Unlimited, used them under license. &quot;BRP&quot; was also used as the base for the Swedish game &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot; from Target Games.

==Reception==
In the July 1981 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 41), Ronald Pehr commented that &quot;&quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; is too little too late. &quot;RuneQuest&quot; is long established, does an adequate job of teaching role-playing, and there are now even more games to choose from. If you want to teach role-playing to a very young, but literate, child, &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; is excellent. Otherwise, for all its charm, it&#x27;s not much use.&quot;.

In the August 1981 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 52), John Sapienza noted that &quot;Basic Roleplaying&quot; was &quot;not a fantasy role-playing game as such, but a handbook on how to role-play and a simple combat system to help the beginner get into the act.&quot; Despite this, Sapienza called it &quot;one of the best introductions to the practical social interactions in gaming that I have read, and will give beginning gamers the kind of guidance they typically do not get in the full-scale games they will graduate to, since game writers usually spend their time on mechanics instead of on the proper relationships between player and player, player and referee, or player and character.&quot; He concluded, &quot;&quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; is a truly universal introduction to the hobby — highly recommended.&quot;

=== Awards ===
The &quot;BRP&quot; itself has been the recipient, via its games, of many awards. Most notable was the 1981 Origins Award for &quot;Best Roleplaying Rules of 1981&quot; for &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;. Other editions of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; have also won Origins Awards including the Hall of Fame award. The &quot;BRP&quot; Character Generation software has also won awards for its design.

<text>In cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm that operates on fixed-length groups of bits, called &quot;blocks&quot;. Block ciphers are the elementary building blocks of many cryptographic protocols. They are ubiquitous in the storage and exchange of data, where such data is secured and authenticated via encryption.

A block cipher uses blocks as an unvarying transformation. Even a secure block cipher is suitable for the encryption of only a single block of data at a time, using a fixed key. A multitude of modes of operation have been designed to allow their repeated use in a secure way to achieve the security goals of confidentiality and authenticity. However, block ciphers may also feature as building blocks in other cryptographic protocols, such as universal hash functions and pseudorandom number generators.

==Definition==

A block cipher consists of two paired algorithms, one for encryption, , and the other for decryption, . Both algorithms accept two inputs: an input block of size bits and a key of size bits; and both yield an -bit output block. The decryption algorithm is defined to be the inverse function of encryption, i.e., . More formally, a block cipher is specified by an encryption function
:formula_1
which takes as input a key , of bit length (called the &quot;key size&quot;), and a bit string , of length (called the &quot;block size&quot;), and returns a string of bits. is called the plaintext, and is termed the ciphertext. For each , the function () is required to be an invertible mapping on . The inverse for is defined as a function
:formula_2
taking a key and a ciphertext to return a plaintext value , such that
:formula_3

For example, a block cipher encryption algorithm might take a 128-bit block of plaintext as input, and output a corresponding 128-bit block of ciphertext. The exact transformation is controlled using a second input – the secret key. Decryption is similar: the decryption algorithm takes, in this example, a 128-bit block of ciphertext together with the secret key, and yields the original 128-bit block of plain text.

For each key &quot;K&quot;, &quot;EK&quot; is a permutation (a bijective mapping) over the set of input blocks. Each key selects one permutation from the set of formula_4 possible permutations.

==History==
The modern design of block ciphers is based on the concept of an iterated product cipher. In his seminal 1949 publication, &quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems&quot;, Claude Shannon analyzed product ciphers and suggested them as a means of effectively improving security by combining simple operations such as substitutions and permutations. Iterated product ciphers carry out encryption in multiple rounds, each of which uses a different subkey derived from the original key. One widespread implementation of such ciphers named a Feistel network after Horst Feistel is notably implemented in the DES cipher. Many other realizations of block ciphers, such as the AES, are classified as substitution–permutation networks.

The root of all cryptographic block formats used within the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards lies with the Atalla Key Block (AKB), which was a key innovation of the Atalla Box, the first hardware security module (HSM). It was developed in 1972 by Mohamed M. Atalla, founder of Atalla Corporation (now Utimaco Atalla), and released in 1973. The AKB was a key block, which is required to securely interchange symmetric keys or PINs with other actors in the banking industry. This secure interchange is performed using the AKB format. The Atalla Box protected over 90% of all ATM networks in operation as of 1998, and Atalla products still secure the majority of the world&#x27;s ATM transactions as of 2014.

The publication of the DES cipher by the United States National Bureau of Standards (subsequently the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) in 1977 was fundamental in the public understanding of modern block cipher design. It also influenced the academic development of cryptanalytic attacks. Both differential and linear cryptanalysis arose out of studies on DES design. , there is a palette of attack techniques against which a block cipher must be secure, in addition to being robust against brute-force attacks.

==Design==

===Iterated block ciphers===
Most block cipher algorithms are classified as &quot;iterated block ciphers&quot; which means that they transform fixed-size blocks of plaintext into identically sized blocks of ciphertext, via the repeated application of an invertible transformation known as the &quot;round function&quot;, with each iteration referred to as a &quot;round&quot;.

Usually, the round function &quot;R&quot; takes different &quot;round keys&quot; &quot;Ki&quot; as a second input, which is derived from the original key:
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the plaintext and formula_7 the ciphertext, with &quot;r&quot; being the number of rounds.

Frequently, key whitening is used in addition to this. At the beginning and the end, the data is modified with key material (often with XOR):
:formula_8
:formula_9
:formula_10

Given one of the standard iterated block cipher design schemes, it is fairly easy to construct a block cipher that is cryptographically secure, simply by using a large number of rounds. However, this will make the cipher inefficient. Thus, efficiency is the most important additional design criterion for professional ciphers. Further, a good block cipher is designed to avoid side-channel attacks, such as branch prediction and input-dependent memory accesses that might leak secret data via the cache state or the execution time. In addition, the cipher should be concise, for small hardware and software implementations.

===Substitution–permutation networks===

One important type of iterated block cipher known as a &quot;substitution–permutation network (SPN)&quot; takes a block of the plaintext and the key as inputs and applies several alternating rounds consisting of a substitution stage followed by a permutation stage—to produce each block of ciphertext output. The non-linear substitution stage mixes the key bits with those of the plaintext, creating Shannon&#x27;s &quot;confusion&quot;. The linear permutation stage then dissipates redundancies, creating &quot;diffusion&quot;.

A &quot;substitution box (S-box)&quot; substitutes a small block of input bits with another block of output bits. This substitution must be one-to-one, to ensure invertibility (hence decryption). A secure S-box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits on average, exhibiting what is known as the avalanche effect—i.e. it has the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit.

A &quot;permutation box (P-box)&quot; is a permutation of all the bits: it takes the outputs of all the S-boxes of one round, permutes the bits, and feeds them into the S-boxes of the next round. A good P-box has the property that the output bits of any S-box are distributed to as many S-box inputs as possible.

At each round, the round key (obtained from the key with some simple operations, for instance, using S-boxes and P-boxes) is combined using some group operation, typically XOR.

Decryption is done by simply reversing the process (using the inverses of the S-boxes and P-boxes and applying the round keys in reversed order).

===Feistel ciphers===
In a &quot;Feistel cipher&quot;, the block of plain text to be encrypted is split into two equal-sized halves. The round function is applied to one half, using a subkey, and then the output is XORed with the other half. The two halves are then swapped.

Let formula_11 be the round function and let
formula_12 be the sub-keys for the rounds formula_13 respectively.

Then the basic operation is as follows:

Split the plaintext block into two equal pieces, (formula_14, formula_15)

For each round formula_16, compute

:formula_17
:formula_18.

Then the ciphertext is formula_19.

The decryption of a ciphertext formula_19 is accomplished by computing for formula_21

:formula_22
:formula_23.

Then formula_24 is the plaintext again.

One advantage of the Feistel model compared to a substitution–permutation network is that the round function formula_11 does not have to be invertible.

===Lai–Massey ciphers===

The Lai–Massey scheme offers security properties similar to those of the Feistel structure. It also shares the advantage that the round function formula_26 does not have to be invertible. Another similarity is that it also splits the input block into two equal pieces. However, the round function is applied to the difference between the two, and the result is then added to both half blocks.

Let formula_26 be the round function and formula_28 a half-round function and let formula_29 be the sub-keys for the rounds formula_13 respectively.

Then the basic operation is as follows:

Split the plaintext block into two equal pieces, (formula_14, formula_15)

For each round formula_16, compute

:formula_34

where formula_35 and formula_36

Then the ciphertext is formula_37.

The decryption of a ciphertext formula_38 is accomplished by computing for formula_21

:formula_40

where formula_41 and formula_42

Then formula_43 is the plaintext again.

===Operations===

====ARX (add–rotate–XOR)====
Many modern block ciphers and hashes are ARX algorithms—their round function involves only three operations: (A) modular addition, (R) rotation with fixed rotation amounts, and (X) XOR. Examples include ChaCha20, Speck, XXTEA, and BLAKE. Many authors draw an ARX network, a kind of data flow diagram, to illustrate such a round function.

These ARX operations are popular because they are relatively fast and cheap in hardware and software, their implementation can be made extremely simple, and also because they run in constant time, and therefore are immune to timing attacks. The rotational cryptanalysis technique attempts to attack such round functions.

====Other operations====
Other operations often used in block ciphers include data-dependent rotations as in RC5 and RC6, a substitution box implemented as a lookup table as in Data Encryption Standard and Advanced Encryption Standard, a permutation box, and multiplication as in IDEA.

==Modes of operation==
A block cipher by itself allows encryption only of a single data block of the cipher&#x27;s block length. For a variable-length message, the data must first be partitioned into separate cipher blocks. In the simplest case, known as electronic codebook (ECB) mode, a message is first split into separate blocks of the cipher&#x27;s block size (possibly extending the last block with padding bits), and then each block is encrypted and decrypted independently. However, such a naive method is generally insecure because equal plaintext blocks will always generate equal ciphertext blocks (for the same key), so patterns in the plaintext message become evident in the ciphertext output.

To overcome this limitation, several so-called block cipher modes of operation have been designed and specified in national recommendations such as NIST 800-38A and BSI TR-02102 and international standards such as ISO/IEC 10116. The general concept is to use randomization of the plaintext data based on an additional input value, frequently called an initialization vector, to create what is termed probabilistic encryption. In the popular cipher block chaining (CBC) mode, for encryption to be secure the initialization vector passed along with the plaintext message must be a random or pseudo-random value, which is added in an exclusive-or manner to the first plaintext block before it is encrypted. The resultant ciphertext block is then used as the new initialization vector for the next plaintext block. In the cipher feedback (CFB) mode, which emulates a self-synchronizing stream cipher, the initialization vector is first encrypted and then added to the plaintext block. The output feedback (OFB) mode repeatedly encrypts the initialization vector to create a key stream for the emulation of a synchronous stream cipher. The newer counter (CTR) mode similarly creates a key stream, but has the advantage of only needing unique and not (pseudo-)random values as initialization vectors; the needed randomness is derived internally by using the initialization vector as a block counter and encrypting this counter for each block.

From a security-theoretic point of view, modes of operation must provide what is known as semantic security. Informally, it means that given some ciphertext under an unknown key one cannot practically derive any information from the ciphertext (other than the length of the message) over what one would have known without seeing the ciphertext. It has been shown that all of the modes discussed above, with the exception of the ECB mode, provide this property under so-called chosen plaintext attacks.

==Padding==

Some modes such as the CBC mode only operate on complete plaintext blocks. Simply extending the last block of a message with zero bits is insufficient since it does not allow a receiver to easily distinguish messages that differ only in the number of padding bits. More importantly, such a simple solution gives rise to very efficient padding oracle attacks. A suitable padding scheme is therefore needed to extend the last plaintext block to the cipher&#x27;s block size. While many popular schemes described in standards and in the literature have been shown to be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, a solution that adds a one-bit and then extends the last block with zero-bits, standardized as &quot;padding method 2&quot; in ISO/IEC 9797-1, has been proven secure against these attacks.

==Cryptanalysis==
===Brute-force attacks===
 This property results in the cipher&#x27;s security degrading quadratically, and needs to be taken into account when selecting a block size. There is a trade-off though as large block sizes can result in the algorithm becoming inefficient to operate. Earlier block ciphers such as the DES have typically selected a 64-bit block size, while newer designs such as the AES support block sizes of 128 bits or more, with some ciphers supporting a range of different block sizes.

===Differential cryptanalysis===

===Linear cryptanalysis===
&quot;A linear cryptanalysis&quot; is a form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis.

The discovery is attributed to Mitsuru Matsui, who first applied the technique to the FEAL cipher (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992).

===Integral cryptanalysis===

&quot;Integral cryptanalysis&quot; is a cryptanalytic attack that is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on substitution–permutation networks. Unlike differential cryptanalysis, which uses pairs of chosen plaintexts with a fixed XOR difference, integral cryptanalysis uses sets or even multisets of chosen plaintexts of which part is held constant and another part varies through all possibilities. For example, an attack might use 256 chosen plaintexts that have all but 8 of their bits the same, but all differ in those 8 bits. Such a set necessarily has an XOR sum of 0, and the XOR sums of the corresponding sets of ciphertexts provide information about the cipher&#x27;s operation. This contrast between the differences between pairs of texts and the sums of larger sets of texts inspired the name &quot;integral cryptanalysis&quot;, borrowing the terminology of calculus.

===Other techniques===

In addition to linear and differential cryptanalysis, there is a growing catalog of attacks: truncated differential cryptanalysis, partial differential cryptanalysis, integral cryptanalysis, which encompasses square and integral attacks, slide attacks, boomerang attacks, the XSL attack, impossible differential cryptanalysis, and algebraic attacks. For a new block cipher design to have any credibility, it must demonstrate evidence of security against known attacks.

==Provable security==
When a block cipher is used in a given mode of operation, the resulting algorithm should ideally be about as secure as the block cipher itself. ECB (discussed above) emphatically lacks this property: regardless of how secure the underlying block cipher is, ECB mode can easily be attacked. On the other hand, CBC mode can be proven to be secure under the assumption that the underlying block cipher is likewise secure. Note, however, that making statements like this requires formal mathematical definitions for what it means for an encryption algorithm or a block cipher to &quot;be secure&quot;. This section describes two common notions for what properties a block cipher should have. Each corresponds to a mathematical model that can be used to prove properties of higher-level algorithms, such as CBC.

This general approach to cryptography – proving higher-level algorithms (such as CBC) are secure under explicitly stated assumptions regarding their components (such as a block cipher) – is known as &quot;provable security&quot;.

===Standard model===

Informally, a block cipher is secure in the standard model if an attacker cannot tell the difference between the block cipher (equipped with a random key) and a random permutation.

To be a bit more precise, let &quot;E&quot; be an &quot;n&quot;-bit block cipher. We imagine the following game:
# The person running the game flips a coin.
#* If the coin lands on heads, he chooses a random key &quot;K&quot; and defines the function &quot;f&quot; = &quot;E&quot;&quot;K&quot;.
#* If the coin lands on tails, he chooses a random permutation on the set of &quot;n&quot;-bit strings and defines the function &quot;f&quot; = .
# The attacker chooses an &quot;n&quot;-bit string &quot;X&quot;, and the person running the game tells him the value of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).
# Step 2 is repeated a total of &quot;q&quot; times. (Each of these &quot;q&quot; interactions is a &quot;query&quot;.)
# The attacker guesses how the coin landed. He wins if his guess is correct.

The attacker, which we can model as an algorithm, is called an &quot;adversary&quot;. The function &quot;f&quot; (which the adversary was able to query) is called an &quot;oracle&quot;.

Note that an adversary can trivially ensure a 50% chance of winning simply by guessing at random (or even by, for example, always guessing &quot;heads&quot;). Therefore, let &quot;P&quot;&quot;E&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) denote the probability that adversary &quot;A&quot; wins this game against &quot;E&quot;, and define the &quot;advantage&quot; of &quot;A&quot; as 2(&quot;P&quot;&quot;E&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) − 1/2). It follows that if &quot;A&quot; guesses randomly, its advantage will be 0; on the other hand, if &quot;A&quot; always wins, then its advantage is 1. The block cipher &quot;E&quot; is a &quot;pseudo-random permutation&quot; (PRP) if no adversary has an advantage significantly greater than 0, given specified restrictions on &quot;q&quot; and the adversary&#x27;s running time. If in Step 2 above adversaries have the option of learning &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;X&quot;) instead of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) (but still have only small advantages) then &quot;E&quot; is a &quot;strong&quot; PRP (SPRP). An adversary is &quot;non-adaptive&quot; if it chooses all &quot;q&quot; values for &quot;X&quot; before the game begins (that is, it does not use any information gleaned from previous queries to choose each &quot;X&quot; as it goes).

These definitions have proven useful for analyzing various modes of operation. For example, one can define a similar game for measuring the security of a block cipher-based encryption algorithm, and then try to show (through a reduction argument) that the probability of an adversary winning this new game is not much more than &quot;P&quot;&quot;E&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) for some &quot;A&quot;. (The reduction typically provides limits on &quot;q&quot; and the running time of &quot;A&quot;.) Equivalently, if &quot;P&quot;&quot;E&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is small for all relevant &quot;A&quot;, then no attacker has a significant probability of winning the new game. This formalizes the idea that the higher-level algorithm inherits the block cipher&#x27;s security.

===Ideal cipher model===
==Practical evaluation==
Block ciphers may be evaluated according to multiple criteria in practice. Common factors include:
* Key parameters, such as its key size and block size, both of which provide an upper bound on the security of the cipher.
* The &quot;estimated security level&quot;, which is based on the confidence gained in the block cipher design after it has largely withstood major efforts in cryptanalysis over time, the design&#x27;s mathematical soundness, and the existence of practical or certificational attacks.
* The cipher&#x27;s &quot;complexity&quot; and its suitability for implementation in hardware or software. Hardware implementations may measure the complexity in terms of gate count or energy consumption, which are important parameters for resource-constrained devices.
* The cipher&#x27;s &quot;performance&quot; in terms of processing throughput on various platforms, including its memory requirements.
* The &quot;cost&quot; of the cipher refers to licensing requirements that may apply due to intellectual property rights.
* The &quot;flexibility&quot; of the cipher includes its ability to support multiple key sizes and block lengths.

==Notable block ciphers==

===Lucifer / DES===

Lucifer is generally considered to be the first civilian block cipher, developed at IBM in the 1970s based on work done by Horst Feistel. A revised version of the algorithm was adopted as a U.S. government Federal Information Processing Standard: FIPS PUB 46 Data Encryption Standard (DES). It was chosen by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS) after a public invitation for submissions and some internal changes by NBS (and, potentially, the NSA). DES was publicly released in 1976 and has been widely used.

DES was designed to, among other things, resist a certain cryptanalytic attack known to the NSA and rediscovered by IBM, though unknown publicly until rediscovered again and published by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir in the late 1980s. The technique is called differential cryptanalysis and remains one of the few general attacks against block ciphers; linear cryptanalysis is another but may have been unknown even to the NSA, prior to its publication by Mitsuru Matsui. DES prompted a large amount of other work and publications in cryptography and cryptanalysis in the open community and it inspired many new cipher designs.

DES has a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 56 bits. 64-bit blocks became common in block cipher designs after DES. Key length depended on several factors, including government regulation. Many observers in the 1970s commented that the 56-bit key length used for DES was too short. As time went on, its inadequacy became apparent, especially after a special-purpose machine designed to break DES was demonstrated in 1998 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. An extension to DES, Triple DES, triple-encrypts each block with either two independent keys (112-bit key and 80-bit security) or three independent keys (168-bit key and 112-bit security). It was widely adopted as a replacement. As of 2011, the three-key version is still considered secure, though the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards no longer permit the use of the two-key version in new applications, due to its 80-bit security level.

===IDEA===
The &quot;International Data Encryption Algorithm&quot; (&quot;IDEA&quot;) is a block cipher designed by James Massey of ETH Zurich and Xuejia Lai; it was first described in 1991, as an intended replacement for DES.

IDEA operates on 64-bit blocks using a 128-bit key and consists of a series of eight identical transformations (a &quot;round&quot;) and an output transformation (the &quot;half-round&quot;). The processes for encryption and decryption are similar. IDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different groups – modular addition and multiplication, and bitwise &quot;exclusive or (XOR)&quot; – which are algebraically &quot;incompatible&quot; in some sense.

The designers analysed IDEA to measure its strength against differential cryptanalysis and concluded that it is immune under certain assumptions. No successful linear or algebraic weaknesses have been reported. , the best attack which applies to all keys can break a full 8.5-round IDEA using a narrow-bicliques attack about four times faster than brute force.

===RC5===
RC5 is a block cipher designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994 which, unlike many other ciphers, has a variable block size (32, 64, or 128 bits), key size (0 to 2040 bits), and a number of rounds (0 to 255). The original suggested choice of parameters was a block size of 64 bits, a 128-bit key, and 12 rounds.

A key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations; one of the goals of RC5 was to prompt the study and evaluation of such operations as a cryptographic primitive. RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and XORs. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like a network. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of &quot;nothing up my sleeve numbers&quot;. The tantalizing simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive object of study for cryptanalysts.

12-round RC5 (with 64-bit blocks) is susceptible to a differential attack using 244 chosen plaintexts. 18–20 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection.

===Rijndael / AES===

The &quot;Rijndael&quot; cipher developed by Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen was one of the competing designs to replace DES. It won the 5-year public competition to become the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

Adopted by NIST in 2001, AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits, whereas Rijndael can be specified with block and key sizes in any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 bits. The block size has a maximum of 256 bits, but the key size has no theoretical maximum. AES operates on a 4×4 column-major order matrix of bytes, termed the &quot;state&quot; (versions of Rijndael with a larger block size have additional columns in the state).

===Blowfish===

&quot;Blowfish&quot; is a block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable key length from 1 bit up to 448 bits. It is a 16-round Feistel cipher and uses large key-dependent S-boxes. Notable features of the design include the key-dependent S-boxes and a highly complex key schedule.

It was designed as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as an alternative to the aging DES and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by patents, or were commercial/government secrets. Schneier has stated that &quot;Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain, and can be freely used by anyone.&quot; The same applies to Twofish, a successor algorithm from Schneier.

==Generalizations==

===Tweakable block ciphers===

M. Liskov, R. Rivest, and D. Wagner have described a generalized version of block ciphers called &quot;tweakable&quot; block ciphers. A tweakable block cipher accepts a second input called the &quot;tweak&quot; along with its usual plaintext or ciphertext input. The tweak, along with the key, selects the permutation computed by the cipher. If changing tweaks is sufficiently lightweight (compared with a usually fairly expensive key setup operation), then some interesting new operation modes become possible. The disk encryption theory article describes some of these modes.

===Format-preserving encryption===

Block ciphers traditionally work over a binary alphabet. That is, both the input and the output are binary strings, consisting of &quot;n&quot; zeroes and ones. In some situations, however, one may wish to have a block cipher that works over some other alphabet; for example, encrypting 16-digit credit card numbers in such a way that the ciphertext is also a 16-digit number might facilitate adding an encryption layer to legacy software. This is an example of &quot;format-preserving encryption&quot;. More generally, format-preserving encryption requires a keyed permutation on some finite language. This makes format-preserving encryption schemes a natural generalization of (tweakable) block ciphers. In contrast, traditional encryption schemes, such as CBC, are not permutations because the same plaintext can encrypt multiple different ciphertexts, even when using a fixed key.

==Relation to other cryptographic primitives==
Block ciphers can be used to build other cryptographic primitives, such as those below. For these other primitives to be cryptographically secure, care has to be taken to build them the right way.

* Stream ciphers can be built using block ciphers. OFB mode and CTR mode are block modes that turn a block cipher into a stream cipher.
* Cryptographic hash functions can be built using block ciphers. See the one-way compression function for descriptions of several such methods. The methods resemble the block cipher modes of operation usually used for encryption.
* Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be built using block ciphers.
* Secure pseudorandom permutations of arbitrarily sized finite sets can be constructed with block ciphers; see Format-Preserving Encryption.
* A publicly known unpredictable permutation combined with key whitening is enough to construct a block cipher -- such as the single-key Even–Mansour cipher, perhaps the simplest possible provably secure block cipher.
* Message authentication codes (MACs) are often built from block ciphers. CBC-MAC, OMAC, and PMAC are such MACs.
* Authenticated encryption is also built from block ciphers. It means to both encrypt and MAC at the same time. That is to both provide confidentiality and authentication. CCM, EAX, GCM, and OCB are such authenticated encryption modes.

Just as block ciphers can be used to build hash functions, like SHA-1 and SHA-2 are based on block ciphers which are also used independently as SHACAL, hash functions can be used to build block ciphers. Examples of such block ciphers are BEAR and LION.

<text>Wireless broadband is a telecommunications technology that provides high-speed wireless Internet access or computer networking access over a wide area. The term encompasses both fixed and mobile broadband.

==The term broadband==
Originally the word &quot;broadband&quot; had a technical meaning, but became a marketing term for any kind of relatively high-speed computer network or Internet access technology.
According to the 802.16-2004 standard, broadband means &quot;having instantaneous bandwidths greater than 1 MHz and supporting data rates greater than about 1.5 Mbit/s.&quot;
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently re-defined the word to mean download speeds of at least 25 Mbit/s and upload speeds of at least 3 Mbit/s.

==Technology and speeds==

A wireless broadband network is an outdoor fixed and/or mobile wireless network providing point-to-multipoint or point-to-point terrestrial wireless links for broadband services.

Wireless networks can feature data rates exceeding 1 Gbit/s. Many fixed wireless networks are exclusively half-duplex (HDX), however, some licensed and unlicensed systems can also operate at full-duplex (FDX) allowing communication in both directions simultaneously.

Outdoor fixed wireless broadband networks commonly use a priority TDMA based protocol in order to divide communication into timeslots. This timeslot technique eliminates many of the issues common to 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol in outdoor networks such as the hidden node problem.

Few wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) provide download speeds of over 100 Mbit/s; most broadband wireless access (BWA) services are estimated to have a range of from a tower. Technologies used include Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) and Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS), as well as heavy use of the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands and one particular access technology was standardized by IEEE 802.16, with products known as WiMAX.

WiMAX is highly popular in Europe but has not been fully accepted in the United States because cost of deployment. In 2005 the Federal Communications Commission adopted a Report and Order that revised the FCC&#x27;s rules to open the 3650 MHz band for terrestrial wireless broadband operations.

Another system that is popular with cable internet service providers uses point-to-multipoint wireless links that extend the existing wired network using a transparent radio connection. This allows the same DOCSIS modems to be used for both wired and wireless customers.

==Development in the United States==
On November 14, 2007, the Commission released Public Notice DA 07–4605 in which the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau announced the start date for licensing and registration process for the 3650–3700 MHz band.
In 2010 the FCC adopted the TV White Space Rules (TVWS) and allowed some of the better no line of sight frequency (700 MHz) into the FCC Part-15 Rules. The Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, a national association of WISPs, petitioned the FCC and won.

Initially, WISPs were found only in rural areas not covered by cable or DSL. These early WISPs would employ a high-capacity T-carrier, such as a T1 or DS3 connection, and then broadcast the signal from a high elevation, such as at the top of a water tower. To receive this type of Internet connection, consumers mount a small dish to the roof of their home or office and point it to the transmitter. Line of sight is usually necessary for WISPs operating in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands with 900 MHz offering better NLOS (non-line-of-sight) performance.

===Residential Wireless Internet===
Providers of fixed wireless broadband services typically provide equipment to customers and install a small antenna or dish somewhere on the roof. This equipment is usually deployed as a service and maintained by the company providing that service. Fixed wireless services have become particularly popular in many rural areas where cable, DSL or other typical home internet services are not available.

===Business Wireless Internet===
Many companies in the US and worldwide have started using wireless alternatives to incumbent and local providers for internet and voice service. These providers tend to offer competitive services and options in areas where there is a difficulty getting affordable Ethernet connections from terrestrial providers such as ATT, Comcast, Verizon and others. Also, companies looking for full diversity between carriers for critical uptime requirements may seek wireless alternatives to local options.

===Demand for spectrum===

To cope with increased demand for wireless broadband, increased spectrum would be needed. Studies began in 2009, and while some unused spectrum was available, it appeared broadcasters would have to give up at least some spectrum. This led to strong objections from the broadcasting community. In 2013, auctions were planned, and for now any action by broadcasters is voluntary.

==Mobile wireless broadband==
In the United States, mobile broadband technologies include services from providers such as Verizon, AT&amp;T Mobility, and T-Mobile which allow a more mobile version of Internet access. Consumers can purchase a PC card, laptop card, USB equipment, or mobile broadband modem, to connect their PC or laptop to the Internet via cell phone towers. This type of connection would be stable in almost any area that could also receive a strong cell phone connection. These connections can cost more for portable convenience as well as having speed limitations in all but urban environments.

On June 2, 2010, after months of discussion, AT&amp;T became the first wireless Internet provider in the US to announce plans to charge according to usage. As the only iPhone service in the United States, AT&amp;T experienced the problem of heavy Internet use more than other providers. About 3 percent of AT&amp;T smart phone customers account for 40 percent of the technology&#x27;s use. 98 percent of the company&#x27;s customers use less than 2 gigabytes (4000 page views, 10,000 emails or 200 minutes of streaming video), the limit under the $25 monthly plan, and 65 percent use less than 200 megabytes, the limit for the $15 plan. For each gigabyte in excess of the limit, customers would be charged $10 a month starting June 7, 2010, though existing customers would not be required to change from the $30 a month unlimited service plan. The new plan would become a requirement for those upgrading to the new iPhone technology later in the summer.

==Licensing==
A wireless connection can be either licensed or unlicensed. In the US, licensed connections use a private spectrum the user has secured rights to from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The unlicensed mobile wireless broadband, in US operates on CBRS Which has three tiers. Tier 1 – Incumbent Access, reserved for US Federals Government, Tier 2 – Priority Access, a paid access with priority on the spectrum, Tier 3 – General Authorized Access (GAA), a shared spectrum. In other countries, spectrum is licensed from the country&#x27;s national radio communications authority (such as the ACMA in Australia or Nigerian Communications Commission in Nigeria (NCC)). Licensing is usually expensive and often reserved for large companies who wish to guarantee private access to spectrum for use in point to point communication. Because of this, most wireless ISP&#x27;s use unlicensed spectrum which is publicly shared.

<doc id="4601" wikidata="Q104506" url="?curid=4601" title="Björn Borg">
<text>Björn Rune Borg (; born 6 June 1956) is a Swedish former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 109 weeks. Borg won 66 singles titles during his career, including eleven majors: six at the French Open and five consecutively at Wimbledon. Borg was ATP Player of the Year from 1976 to 1980, the year-end No. 1 in the ATP rankings in 1979 and 1980, and the ITF World Champion from 1978 to 1980.

A teenage sensation at the start of his career, Borg experienced unprecedented stardom and consistent success that helped propel the rising popularity of tennis during the 1970s. Between 1974 and 1981, Borg claimed 11 major singles titles, the most by any man in the Open Era up to that point. His rivalries with Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe became cultural touchstones beyond the world of tennis, with the latter rivalry peaking at the 1980 Wimbledon final, considered one of the greatest matches ever played. Following defeats to McEnroe in the 1981 Wimbledon and US Open finals, Borg unexpectedly retired from tennis at the age of 25. He made a brief and unsuccessful comeback in 1991.

Borg won four consecutive French Open titles (1978–81) and was undefeated in six French Open finals. He is the only man to achieve the Channel Slam three times. He won three major titles without losing a set during those tournaments. However, he never won the US Open despite four runner-up finishes. Borg also won three year-end championships and 16 Grand Prix Super Series titles. In 1979, Borg became the first player to earn more than US$1 million in prize money in a single season. Overall, he set numerous records, some of which still stand.

Borg is widely considered one of the all-time greats of the sport, and was ranked by &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine as the sixth-greatest male player of the Open Era.

==Early life==
Björn Borg was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 6 June 1956, the only child of Rune (1932–2008), an electrician, and Margaretha Borg (b. 1934). He grew up in nearby Södertälje. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racket that his father won at a table-tennis tournament. His father gave him the racket, beginning his tennis career.

A player of great athleticism and endurance, he had a distinctive style and appearance—bowlegged and very fast. His muscularity allowed him to put heavy topspin on both his forehand and two-handed backhand. He followed Jimmy Connors in using the two-handed backhand. By the time he was 13, he was beating the best of Sweden&#x27;s under-18 players, and Davis Cup captain Lennart Bergelin (who served as Borg&#x27;s primary coach throughout his professional career) cautioned against anyone trying to change Borg&#x27;s rough-looking, jerky strokes.

==Career==

===1972–73 – Davis Cup debut and first year on the tour===

At the age of 15, Borg represented Sweden in the 1972 Davis Cup and won his debut singles rubber in five sets against veteran Onny Parun of New Zealand. Later that year, he won the Wimbledon junior singles title, recovering from a 5–2 deficit in the final set to overcome Britain&#x27;s Buster Mottram. Then in December, he won the Orange Bowl Junior Championship for boys 18 and under after a straight-sets victory in the final over Vitas Gerulaitis. Borg joined the professional circuit in 1973, and reached his first singles final in April at the Monte Carlo Open, which he lost to Ilie Năstase. He was unseeded at his first French Open and reached the fourth round where he lost in four sets to eighth-seeded Adriano Panatta. Borg was seeded sixth at his first Wimbledon Championships, in large part due to a boycott by the ATP, and reached the quarterfinal, where he was defeated in a five-set match by Roger Taylor. In the second half of 1973, he was runner-up in San Francisco, Stockholm and Buenos Aires and finished the year ranked No. 18.

===1974 – First French Open title===

Borg made his only appearance at the Australian Open at the age of 17, and reached the third round, where he lost in straight sets to eventual finalist Phil Dent. In January, he won his first career singles title at the New Zealand Open, followed by titles in London and São Paulo in February and March respectively. Just before his 18th birthday in June 1974, Borg won his first top-level singles title at the Italian Open, defeating defending champion and top-seeded Ilie Năstase in the final and becoming its youngest winner. Two weeks later, he won the singles title at the French Open, his first Grand Slam tournament title, defeating Manuel Orantes in the final in five sets. Barely 18, Borg was the youngest-ever male French Open champion up to that point.

===1975 – Retained French Open title===

In early 1975, Borg defeated Rod Laver, then 36 years old, in a semifinal of the World Championship Tennis (WCT) finals in Dallas, Texas, in five sets. Borg subsequently lost to Arthur Ashe in the final.
Borg retained his French Open title in 1975, beating Guillermo Vilas in the final in straight sets. Borg then reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals, where he lost to eventual champion Ashe. Borg did not lose another match at Wimbledon until 1981. Borg won two singles and one doubles rubber in the 1975 Davis Cup final, as Sweden beat Czechoslovakia 3–2. With these singles wins, Borg had won 19 consecutive Davis Cup singles rubbers since 1973. That was already a record at the time. However, Borg never lost another Davis Cup singles rubber, and, by the end of his career, he had stretched that winning streak to 33.

===1976 – First Wimbledon title===

In early 1976, Borg won the World Championship Tennis year-end WCT Finals in Dallas, Texas, with a four-set victory over Guillermo Vilas in the final. At the 1976 French Open, Borg lost to the Italian Adriano Panatta, who remains the only player to defeat Borg at this tournament. Panatta did it twice: in the fourth round in 1973, and in the 1976 quarterfinals. Borg won Wimbledon in 1976 without losing a set, defeating the favored Ilie Năstase in the final. Borg became the youngest male Wimbledon singles champion since Sidney Wood in 1931 at 20 years and 1 month (a record subsequently broken by Boris Becker, who won Wimbledon aged 17 in 1985). Năstase later said, &quot;We&#x27;re playing tennis and he&#x27;s playing something else.&quot; Borg also reached the final of the 1976 U.S. Open, which was then being played on clay courts. Borg lost in four sets to world no. 1 Jimmy Connors. Borg was awarded the ATP Player of the Year award and ranked world No. 1 by &quot;Tennis Magazine&quot; (France).

===1977 – Second Wimbledon title and world No.1 ranking===
In February 1977 World Championship Tennis (WCT) sued Borg and his management company IMG claiming that Borg had committed a breach of contract by electing to participate in the competing 1977 Grand Prix circuit instead of the WCT circuit. Borg eventually played, and won, a single WCT event, the Monte Carlo WCT. An out-of-court settlement was reached whereby Borg committed to play six or eight WCT events in 1978 which were then part of the Grand Prix circuit.

Borg skipped the French Open in 1977 because he was under contract with WTT, but he repeated his Wimbledon triumph, although this time he was pushed much harder. He defeated his good friend Vitas Gerulaitis in a semifinal in five sets. His match with Gerulaitis was deemed by Wimbledon itself as &quot;probably the greatest gentlemen&#x27;s singles match played at Wimbledon&quot;. In the 1977 final Borg was pushed to five sets for the third time in the tournament, this time by Connors. The win propelled Borg to the No. 1 ranking in the ATP point system, albeit for just one week in August. Prior to the 1977 US Open, Borg aggravated a shoulder injury while waterskiing with Vitas Gerulaitis. This injury ultimately forced him to retire from the Open during a Round of 16 match vs Dick Stockton. Borg was rated number one for 1977 by &quot;Tennis Magazine&quot; (France), &quot;Tennis Magazine&quot; (U.S.), Barry Lorge, Lance Tingay, Rino Tommasi, Judith Elian and Rod Laver. Borg was also named &quot;ATP Player of the Year&quot;. Through 1977, he had never lost to a player younger than himself.

===1978 – French and Wimbledon titles===
Borg was at the height of his career from 1978 through 1980, completing the French Open-Wimbledon double all three years. In 1978, Borg won the French Open with a win over Vilas in the final. Borg did not drop a set during the tournament, a feat only he, Năstase (in 1973), and Rafael Nadal (in 2008, 2010, 2017 and 2020) have accomplished at the French Open during the open era. Borg defeated Connors in straight sets in the 1978 Wimbledon final. At the 1978 US Open, now held on hard courts in Flushing Meadow, New York, he lost the final in straight sets to Connors. Borg was suffering from a bad blister on his thumb that required pre-match injections. That autumn, Borg faced John McEnroe for the first time in a semifinal of the Stockholm Open, and lost. Borg was named ATP Player of the Year and was the first ITF World Champion.

===1979 – French and Wimbledon titles and year-end No. 1 ranking===

Borg lost to McEnroe again in four sets in the final of the 1979 WCT Finals but was now overtaking Connors for the top ranking. Borg established himself firmly in the top spot with his fourth French Open singles title and fourth straight Wimbledon singles title, defeating Connors in a straight-set semifinal at the latter tournament. At the 1979 French Open, Borg defeated big-serving Víctor Pecci in a four-set final, and in the 1979 Wimbledon final Borg came from behind to overcome an even bigger server, Roscoe Tanner. Borg was upset by Tanner at the US Open, in a four-set quarterfinal played under the lights. At the season-ending Masters tournament in January 1980, Borg survived a close semifinal against McEnroe. He then beat Gerulaitis in straight sets, winning his first Masters and first title in New York. Borg finished the year at No. 1 in the ATP Point rankings and was considered the No. 1 player in the world by most authorities.

===1980 – French and fifth consecutive Wimbledon title===

In June, Borg overcame Gerulaitis, again in straight sets, for his fifth French Open title. Again, he did not drop a set during the tournament.

Borg then won his fifth consecutive Wimbledon singles title, defeating McEnroe in a five-set final, often cited as the best Wimbledon final ever played. Having lost the opening set to an all-out McEnroe assault, Borg took the next two and had two championship points at 5–4 in the fourth. However, McEnroe averted disaster and went on to level the match in Wimbledon&#x27;s most memorable tiebreaker, which McEnroe won 18–16. In the fourth-set tiebreak, McEnroe saved five match points, and Borg six set points, before McEnroe won the set. Björn served first to begin the 5th set and fell behind 0–30. Borg then won 19 straight points on serve in the deciding set and prevailed after 3 hours, 53 minutes. Borg himself commented years later that this was the first time that he was afraid that he would lose, as well as feeling that it was the beginning of the end of his dominance.

In September, 1980 Borg reached the final of the U.S. Open for the third time, losing to John McEnroe in five sets in a match that cemented what had become the greatest contemporary rivalry, albeit short-lived, in men&#x27;s tennis.

He defeated McEnroe in the final of the 1980 Stockholm Open, and faced him one more time that year, in the round-robin portion of the year-end Masters, actually played in January 1981. With 19,103 fans in attendance, Borg won a deciding third-set tie-break for the second year in a row. Borg then defeated Ivan Lendl for his second Masters title. Borg again finished the year at No. 1 in the ATP Point Rankings and was considered the No. 1 player in the world by most tennis authorities.

===1981 – Sixth and final French Open title===
Borg won his last Grand Slam title at the French Open in 1981, defeating Lendl in a five-set final. Borg&#x27;s six French Open Grand Slam titles was a record bettered only by Rafael Nadal in 2012.

In reaching the Wimbledon final in 1981, Borg stretched his winning streak at the All England Club to a record 41 matches. In a semifinal, Borg was down to Connors by two sets to love, before coming back to win the match. However, Borg&#x27;s streak was brought to an end by McEnroe, who defeated him in four sets. Years afterward, Borg remarked &quot;And when I lost what shocked me was I wasn&#x27;t even upset. That was not me: losing a Wimbledon final and not upset. I hate to lose.&quot; Borg around that time felt that his desire to play was gone, despite McEnroe&#x27;s desperate efforts to persuade him not to retire and continue their rivalry.

Borg went on to lose to McEnroe at the 1981 US Open. After that defeat, Borg walked off the court and out of the stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun, and headed straight for the airport. There are reports that Borg received threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would be the Swede&#x27;s last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule; by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. However, Borg wanted to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often. Although he felt in good condition physically, he recognized that the relentless drive to win and defy tour organizers had begun to fade.

Borg failed to win the US Open in nine tries, losing four finals, 1976 (the surface was clay that year) and 1978 to Jimmy Connors, and 1980 and 1981 to John McEnroe. The surface was hard court from 1978 onward and Borg reached the final there on hard court on three occasions, in 1978, 1980 and 1981. He led 3–2 in the fifth set of the 1980 final, before losing. That match followed Borg&#x27;s classic encounter with McEnroe at the 1980 Wimbledon. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, Borg was halfway to a Grand Slam after victories at the French and Wimbledon (the Australian Open being the last Grand Slam tournament of each year at the time) only to falter at Flushing Meadows, the left-handed Roscoe Tanner being his conqueror in 1979.

===1982–91: Retirement===

In 1982, Borg played only two tournaments. He lost to Yannick Noah in the quarterfinals of Monte Carlo in April and in the same month he lost to Dick Stockton in the second round of qualifying at the Alan King Tennis Classic in Las Vegas. Nevertheless, Borg&#x27;s announcement in January 1983 that he was retiring from the game at the age of 26 was a shock to the tennis world. McEnroe tried unsuccessfully to persuade Borg to continue. He did, however, play Monte Carlo again in March 1983, reaching the second round, and Stuttgart in July 1984, losing to Henri Leconte in both occasions.

Upon retirement, Borg had three residences: a penthouse in Monte Carlo, not far from his pro shop; a mansion on Long Island, New York and a small island off the Swedish coast.

Borg later bounced back as the owner of the Björn Borg fashion label. In Sweden, his label has become very successful, second only to Calvin Klein.

===Attempted comeback===

In 1991–1993, Borg attempted a comeback on the men&#x27;s professional tennis tour, coached by Welsh karate expert Ron Thatcher. Before his 1991 return, Borg grew his hair out as it had been during his previous professional tennis career and he returned to using a wooden racket; he had kept his hair cut and used modern graphite rackets in exhibitions he played during the late 1980s. Borg, however, failed to win a single match. He faced Jordi Arrese in his first match back, again at Monte Carlo but without practising or playing any exhibition matches and lost in two sets. In his first nine matches, played in 1991 and 1992, Borg failed to win a single set. He fared slightly better in 1993, taking a set off his opponent in each of the three matches he played. He came closest to getting a win in what turned out to be his final tour match, falling to second seed Alexander Volkov 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7–9) at the 1993 Kremlin Cup in Moscow.

In 1992 Borg, aged 35, using a graphite racket, defeated John Lloyd, 37, at the Inglewood Forum Tennis Challenge. Borg later joined the Champions tour, using modern rackets.

==Playing style==
Borg had one of the most distinctive playing styles in the Open Era. He played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes. His highly unorthodox backhand involved taking his racket back with both hands but actually generating his power with his dominant right hand, letting go of the grip with his left hand around point of contact, and following through with his swing as a one-hander. He hit the ball hard and high from the back of the court and brought it down with considerable topspin, which made his ground strokes very consistent. There had been other players, particularly Rod Laver and Arthur Ashe, who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand, yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to mix up their shots to pass their opponents at the net easily. Borg was one of the first top players to use heavy topspin on his shots consistently.

Complementing his consistent ground-strokes was his fitness. Both of these factors allowed Borg to be dominant at the French Open.

One of the factors that made Borg unique was his dominance on the grass courts of Wimbledon, where, since World War II, baseliners did not usually succeed. Some experts attributed his dominance on this surface to his consistency, an underrated serve, equally underrated volleys, and his adaptation to grass courts. Against the best players, he almost always served-and-volleyed on his first serves, while he naturally played from the baseline after his second serves.

Another trait usually associated with Borg was his grace under pressure. His calm court demeanor earned him the nickname of the &quot;Ice Man&quot; or &quot;Ice-Borg&quot;.

Borg&#x27;s physical conditioning was unrivalled by contemporaries. He could outlast most of his opponents under the most grueling conditions. Contrary to popular belief, however, this was not due to his exceptionally low resting heart rate, often reported to be near 35 beats per minute. In his introduction to Borg&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Life and Game&quot;, Eugene Scott relates that this rumor arose from a medical exam the 18-year-old Borg once took for military service, where his pulse was recorded as 38. Scott goes on to reveal Borg&#x27;s true pulse rate as &quot;about 50 when he wakes up and around 60 in the afternoon&quot;. Borg is credited with helping to develop the style of play that has come to dominate the game today.

==Mental approach==
Borg&#x27;s first wife has said that he was &quot;always very placid and calm, except if he lost a match – he wouldn&#x27;t talk for at least three days. He couldn&#x27;t stand losing.&quot; This mental approach changed by 1981, when he has said that when he lost the Wimbledon final &quot;what shocked me was I wasn&#x27;t even upset&quot;.

==Personal life==

Borg and Romanian tennis pro Mariana Simionescu began their relationship in 1976 and married in Bucharest on 24 July 1980. The marriage ended in divorce in 1984. He fathered a son named Robin in 1985 with the Swedish model Jannike Björling; Robin had a daughter in 2014. Borg was married to the Italian singer Loredana Bertè from 1989 to 1993. On 8 June 2002, he married his third wife, Patricia Östfeld. Together they have a son, Leo, born in 2003, who is also a professional tennis player.

He narrowly avoided personal bankruptcy when business ventures failed. After selling his mansion Astaholm at Ingarö in the Stockholm archipelago in 2019, Borg moved to an apartment in Norrmalm, central Stockholm.

==Film==
In 2017, &quot;Borg vs McEnroe&quot;, a biographical film focusing on the rivalry between Borg and McEnroe and the 1980 Wimbledon final, was released. In 2022, interviews about this friendship and rivalry were also featured in &quot;McEnroe,&quot; a Showtime documentary.

==Memorabilia preserved==
In March 2006, Bonhams Auction House in London announced that it would auction Borg&#x27;s Wimbledon trophies and two of his winning rackets on 21 June 2006. Several players then called Borg in an attempt to make him reconsider, including Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi, who volunteered to buy them to keep them together. According to – who had talked to Borg – McEnroe called Borg from New York and asked, &quot;What&#x27;s up? Have you gone mad?&quot; and said &quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; The conversation with McEnroe, paired with pleas from Connors and Agassi, eventually persuaded Borg to buy out the trophies from Bonhams for an undisclosed amount.

==Recognition==

With 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg ranks sixth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind Novak Djokovic (24), Rafael Nadal (22), Roger Federer (20), Pete Sampras (14) and Roy Emerson (12). The French Open—Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was described by Wimbledon officials as &quot;the most difficult double in tennis&quot;. Only Nadal (in 2008 and 2010), Federer (in 2009), Djokovic (in 2021) and Alcaraz (in 2024) have managed to achieve this double since, and Agassi, Nadal, Federer, Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men&#x27;s singles titles over their career. Ilie Năstase once said about Borg, &quot;We&#x27;re playing tennis, and he&#x27;s playing something else&quot;.
Borg is widely considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.
In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, Bud Collins chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time. In 1983 Fred Perry listed his greatest male players of all time and listed them in two categories, before World War 2 and after. Perry&#x27;s modern best behind Laver: &quot;Borg, McEnroe, Connors, Hoad, Jack Kramer, John Newcombe, Ken Rosewall, Manuel Santana&quot;. In 1988, a panel consisting of Bud Collins, Cliff Drysdale, and Butch Buchholz ranked their top five male tennis players of all time. Buchholz and Drysdale both listed Borg number two on their lists, behind Rod Laver. Collins listed Borg number five behind Laver, McEnroe, Rosewall and Gonzales.

In 2008, ESPN.com asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open-era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories: defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness—with his mental game and footwork singled out as the best in open-era history.

Borg never won the US Open, losing in the final four times. Borg also did not win the Australian Open, which he only played once in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. Phil Dent, a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments—especially the Australian Open—was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm. Additionally, another contemporary Arthur Ashe told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;I think Bjorn could have won the US Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam, but by the time he left, the historical challenge didn&#x27;t mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like Elvis or Liz Taylor or somebody.&quot;

==Laver Cup==
From 22 to 24 September 2017, Borg was the victorious captain of Team Europe in the first-ever edition of the Laver Cup, held in Prague, Czech Republic. Borg&#x27;s Team Europe defeated a rest of the world team, known as Team World, who were coached by Borg&#x27;s old rival, John McEnroe. Europe won the contest 15 points to 9, with Roger Federer achieving a narrow vital victory over Nick Kyrgios in the last match played.

Borg returned as the coach of Team Europe for the second edition in Chicago, Illinois from 21 to 23 September 2018. McEnroe also returned as the coach for Team World. Borg again led Europe to victory as Alexander Zverev defeated Kevin Anderson to secure the title 13–8, after trailing Anderson in the match tiebreak until the last few points.

In the tournament&#x27;s third edition, held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 20 to 22 September 2019, Borg captained Team Europe to a third consecutive victory, defeating McEnroe&#x27;s Team World 13 points to 11, with Zverev again winning the deciding match.

The fourth edition was held in Boston from 24 to 26 September 2021, having had its original September 2020 date postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Borg once again returned as captain of Team Europe, which had a resounding win over Team World, defeating McEnroe&#x27;s players 14 to 1.

Sutter has attempted to list all tournaments meeting his criteria for selection beginning with 1946 and ending in the fall of 1991. For each tournament, he has indicated the city, the date of the final, the winner, the runner-up, and the score of the final. A tournament is included in his list if: (1) the draw for the tournament included at least eight players (with a few exceptions, such as the Pepsi Grand Slam tournaments in the second half of the 1970s which included only players that had won a Grand Slam tournament); and (2) the level of the tournaments was at least equal to the present day challenger tournaments. Sutter&#x27;s book is probably the most exhaustive source of tennis tournament information since World War II, even though some professional tournaments held before the start of the open era are missing. Later, Sutter issued a second edition of his book, with only the players, their wins, and years for the 1946 through 27 April 2003, period.

<text>The Battle of the Nile (also known as the Battle of Aboukir Bay; ) was a major naval battle fought between Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy and the French Republic Navy at Aboukir Bay on the Mediterranean coast off the Nile Delta of Egypt between 1–3 August 1798. The battle was the climax of a naval campaign that had raged across the Mediterranean during the previous three months, as a large French convoy sailed from Toulon to Alexandria carrying an expeditionary force under General Napoleon Bonaparte. The British fleet was led in the battle by Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson; they decisively defeated the French under Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d&#x27;Aigalliers, destroying the best of the French navy, which was weakened for the rest of the Napoleonic Wars.

Bonaparte sought to invade Egypt as the first step in a campaign against British India, as part of a greater effort to drive Britain out of the French Revolutionary Wars. As Bonaparte&#x27;s fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the Tagus to learn the purpose of the French expedition and to defeat it. He chased the French for more than two months, on several occasions missing them only by a matter of hours. Bonaparte was aware of Nelson&#x27;s pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination. He was able to capture Malta and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.

With the French army ashore, the French fleet anchored in Aboukir Bay, northeast of Alexandria. Commander Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d&#x27;Aigalliers believed that he had established a formidable defensive position. The British fleet arrived off Egypt on 1 August and discovered Brueys&#x27;s dispositions, and Nelson ordered an immediate attack. His ships advanced on the French line and split into two divisions as they approached. One cut across the head of the line and passed between the anchored French and the shore, while the other engaged the seaward side of the French fleet. Trapped in a crossfire, the leading French warships were battered into surrender during a fierce three-hour battle, although the centre of the line held out for a while until more British ships were able to join the attack. At 22:00, the French flagship exploded which prompted the rear division of the French fleet to attempt to break out of the bay. With Brueys dead and his vanguard and centre defeated, only two ships of the line and two frigates escaped from a total of 17 ships engaged.

The battle reversed the strategic situation between the two nations&#x27; forces in the Mediterranean and entrenched the Royal Navy in the dominant position that it retained for the rest of the Napoleonic Wars. It also encouraged other European countries to turn against France, and was a factor in the outbreak of the War of the Second Coalition. Bonaparte&#x27;s army was trapped in Egypt, and Royal Navy dominance off the Syrian coast contributed significantly to the French defeat at the siege of Acre in 1799 which preceded Bonaparte&#x27;s abandonment of Egypt and return to Europe. Nelson was wounded in the battle, and he was proclaimed a hero across Europe and was subsequently made Baron Nelson—although he was privately dissatisfied with his rewards. His captains were also highly praised and went on to form the nucleus of the legendary Nelson&#x27;s Band of Brothers. The legend of the battle has remained prominent in the popular consciousness, with perhaps the best-known representation being Felicia Hemans&#x27; 1826 poem &quot;Casabianca&quot;.

==Background==
Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s victories in northern Italy over the Austrian Empire helped secure victory for the French in the War of the First Coalition in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still at war with the French Republic. The French Directory investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of Ireland and Britain and the expansion of the French Navy to challenge the Royal Navy at sea. Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term, and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the Atlantic Ocean. However, the French navy was dominant in the Mediterranean, following the withdrawal of the British fleet after the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain in 1796. This allowed Bonaparte to propose an invasion of Egypt as an alternative to confronting Britain directly, believing that the British would be too distracted by an imminent Irish uprising to intervene in the Mediterranean.

Bonaparte believed that, by establishing a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral Ottoman Empire), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against British India, possibly by means of an alliance with the Tipu Sultan of Seringapatam, that might successfully drive the British out of the war. The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, an essential part of the British Empire whose trade generated the wealth that Britain required to prosecute the war successfully. The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte&#x27;s plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel as far from France as possible. During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at Toulon. He also formed the &quot;Commission des Sciences et des Arts&quot;, a body of scientists and engineers intended to establish a French colony in Egypt. Napoleon kept the destination of the expedition top secret—most of the army&#x27;s officers did not know of its target, and Bonaparte did not publicly reveal his goal until the first stage of the expedition was complete.

===Mediterranean campaign===


Bonaparte&#x27;s armada sailed from Toulon on 19 May, making rapid progress through the Ligurian Sea and collecting more ships at Genoa, before sailing southwards along the Sardinian coast and passing Sicily on 7 June. On 9 June, the fleet arrived off Malta, then under the ownership of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, ruled by Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim. Bonaparte demanded that his fleet be permitted entry to the fortified harbour of Valletta. When the Knights refused, the French general responded by ordering a large scale invasion of the Maltese Islands, overrunning the defenders after 24 hours of skirmishing. The Knights formally surrendered on 12 June and, in exchange for substantial financial compensation, handed the islands and all of their resources over to Bonaparte, including the extensive property of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta. Within a week, Bonaparte had resupplied his ships, and on 19 June, his fleet departed for Alexandria in the direction of Crete, leaving 4,000 men at Valletta under General Claude-Henri Vaubois to ensure French control of the islands.

While Bonaparte was sailing to Malta, the Royal Navy re-entered the Mediterranean for the first time in more than a year. Alarmed by reports of French preparations on the Mediterranean coast, Lord Spencer at the Admiralty sent a message to Vice-Admiral Earl St. Vincent, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet based in the Tagus, to despatch a squadron to investigate. This squadron, consisting of three ships of the line and three frigates, was entrusted to Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson.

Nelson was a highly experienced officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in Corsica in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish ships of the line at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in February 1797. In July 1797, he lost an arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and had been forced to return to Britain to recuperate. Returning to the fleet at the Tagus in late April 1798, he was ordered to collect the squadron stationed at Gibraltar and sail for the Ligurian Sea. On 21 May, as Nelson&#x27;s squadron approached Toulon, it was struck by a fierce gale and Nelson&#x27;s flagship, , lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast. The remainder of the squadron was scattered. The ships of the line sheltered at San Pietro Island off Sardinia; the frigates were blown to the west and failed to return.

On 7 June, following hasty repairs to his flagship, a fleet consisting of ten ships of the line and a fourth-rate joined Nelson off Toulon. The fleet, under the command of Captain Thomas Troubridge, had been sent by Earl St. Vincent to reinforce Nelson, with orders that he was to pursue and intercept the Toulon convoy. Although he now had enough ships to challenge the French fleet, Nelson suffered two great disadvantages: He had no intelligence regarding the destination of the French, and no frigates to scout ahead of his force. Striking southwards in the hope of collecting information about French movements, Nelson&#x27;s ships stopped at Elba and Naples, where the British ambassador, Sir William Hamilton, reported that the French fleet had passed Sicily headed in the direction of Malta. Despite pleas from Nelson and Hamilton, King Ferdinand of Naples refused to lend his frigates to the British fleet, fearing French reprisals. On 22 June, a brig sailing from Ragusa brought Nelson the news that the French had sailed eastwards from Malta on 16 June. After conferring with his captains, the admiral decided that the French target must be Egypt and set off in pursuit. Incorrectly believing the French to be five days ahead rather than two, Nelson insisted on a direct route to Alexandria without deviation.

On the evening of 22 June, Nelson&#x27;s fleet passed the French in the darkness, overtaking the slow invasion convoy without realising how close they were to their target. Making rapid time on a direct route, Nelson reached Alexandria on 28 June and discovered that the French were not there. After a meeting with the suspicious Ottoman commander, Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim, Nelson ordered the British fleet northwards, reaching the coast of Anatolia on 4 July and turning westwards back towards Sicily. Nelson had missed the French by less than a day—the scouts of the French fleet arrived off Alexandria in the evening of 29 June.

Concerned by his near encounter with Nelson, Bonaparte ordered an immediate invasion, his troops coming ashore in a poorly managed amphibious operation in which at least 20 drowned. Marching along the coast, the French army stormed Alexandria and captured the city, after which Bonaparte led the main force of his army inland. He instructed his naval commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys D&#x27;Aigalliers, to anchor in Alexandria harbour, but naval surveyors reported that the channel into the harbour was too shallow and narrow for the larger ships of the French fleet. As a result, the French selected an alternative anchorage at Aboukir Bay, northeast of Alexandria.

Nelson&#x27;s fleet reached Syracuse in Sicily on 19 July and took on essential supplies. There the admiral wrote letters describing the events of the previous months: &quot;It is an old saying, &#x27;the Devil&#x27;s children have the Devil&#x27;s luck.&#x27; I cannot find, or at this moment learn, beyond vague conjecture where the French fleet are gone to. All my ill fortune, hitherto, has proceeded from want of frigates.&quot; Meanwhile, the French were securing Egypt by the Battle of the Pyramids. By 24 July, the British fleet was resupplied and, having determined that the French must be somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, Nelson sailed again in the direction of the Morea. On 28 July, at Coron, Nelson finally obtained intelligence describing the French attack on Egypt and turned south across the Mediterranean. His scouts, and , sighted the French transport fleet at Alexandria on the afternoon of 1 August.

===Aboukir Bay===
When Alexandria harbour had proved inadequate for his fleet, Brueys had gathered his captains and discussed their options. Bonaparte had ordered the fleet to anchor in Aboukir Bay, a shallow and exposed anchorage, but had supplemented the orders with the suggestion that, if Aboukir Bay was too dangerous, Brueys could sail north to Corfu, leaving only the transports and a handful of lighter warships at Alexandria. Brueys refused, in the belief that his squadron could provide essential support to the French army on shore, and called his captains aboard his 120-gun flagship to discuss their response should Nelson discover the fleet in its anchorage. Despite vocal opposition from Contre-amiral Armand Blanquet, who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a line of battle inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson. It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans, although Bedouin partisans intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions.

Aboukir Bay is a coastal indentation across, stretching from the village of Abu Qir in the west to the town of Rosetta to the east, where one of the mouths of the River Nile empties into the Mediterranean. In 1798, the bay was protected at its western end by extensive rocky shoals which ran into the bay from a promontory guarded by Aboukir Castle. A small fort situated on an island among the rocks protected the shoals. The fort was garrisoned by French soldiers and armed with at least four cannon and two heavy mortars. Brueys had augmented the fort with his bomb vessels and gunboats, anchored among the rocks to the west of the island in a position to give support to the head of the French line. Further shoals ran unevenly to the south of the island and extended across the bay in a rough semicircle approximately from the shore. These shoals were too shallow to permit the passage of larger warships, and so Brueys ordered his thirteen ships of the line to form up in a line of battle following the northeastern edge of the shoals to the south of the island, a position that allowed the ships to disembark supplies from their port sides while covering the landings with their starboard batteries. Orders were issued for each ship to attach strong cables to the bow and stern of their neighbours, which would effectively turn the line into a long battery forming a theoretically impregnable barrier. Brueys positioned a second, inner line of four frigates approximately west of the main line, roughly halfway between the line and the shoal. The van of the French line was led by , positioned southeast of Aboukir Island and about from the edge of the shoals that surrounded the island. The line stretched southeast, with the centre bowed seawards away from the shoal. The French ships were spaced at intervals of and the whole line was long, with the flagship &quot;Orient&quot; at the centre and two large 80-gun ships anchored on either side. The rear division of the line was under the command of Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve in .

In deploying his ships in this way, Brueys hoped that the British would be forced by the shoals to attack his strong centre and rear, allowing his van to use the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack the British once they were engaged. However, he had made a serious misjudgement: he had left enough room between &quot;Guerrier&quot; and the shoals for an enemy ship to cut across the head of the French line and proceed between the shoals and the French ships, allowing the unsupported vanguard to be caught in a crossfire by two divisions of enemy ships. Compounding this error, the French only prepared their ships for battle on their starboard (seaward) sides, from which they expected the attack would have to come; their landward port sides were unprepared.
The port side gun ports were closed, and the decks on that side were uncleared, with various stored items blocking access to the guns. Brueys&#x27; dispositions had a second significant flaw: The 160-yard gaps between ships were large enough for a British ship to push through and break the French line. Furthermore, not all of the French captains had followed Brueys&#x27; orders to attach cables to their neighbours&#x27; bow and stern, which would have prevented such a manoeuvre. The problem was exacerbated by orders to only anchor at the bow, which allowed the ships to swing with the wind and widened the gaps. It also created areas within the French line not covered by the broadside of any ship. British vessels could anchor in those spaces and engage the French without reply. In addition, the deployment of Brueys&#x27; fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.

A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Constant attacks by Bedouin partisans, however, required escorts of heavily armed guards for each party. Hence, up to a third of the fleet&#x27;s sailors were away from their ships at any one time. Brueys wrote a letter describing the situation to Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix, reporting that &quot;Our crews are weak, both in number and quality. Our rigging, in general, out of repair, and I am sure it requires no little courage to undertake the management of a fleet furnished with such tools.&quot;

==Battle==
===Nelson&#x27;s arrival===

Although initially disappointed that the main French fleet was not at Alexandria, Nelson knew from the presence of the transports that they must be nearby. At 14:00 on 1 August, lookouts on reported the French anchored in Aboukir Bay, its signal lieutenant just beating the lieutenant on with the signal, but inaccurately describing 16 French ships of the line instead of 13. At the same time, French lookouts on , the ninth ship in the French line, sighted the British fleet approximately nine nautical miles off the mouth of Aboukir Bay. The French initially reported just 11 British ships – &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Alexander&quot; were still returning from their scouting operations at Alexandria, and so were to the west of the main fleet, out of sight. Troubridge&#x27;s ship, , was also some distance from the main body, towing a captured merchant ship. At the sight of the French, Troubridge abandoned the vessel and made strenuous efforts to rejoin Nelson. Due to the need for so many sailors to work onshore, Brueys had not deployed any of his lighter warships as scouts, which left him unable to react swiftly to the sudden appearance of the British.

As his ships readied for action, Brueys ordered his captains to gather for a conference on &quot;Orient&quot; and hastily recalled his shore parties, although most had still not returned by the start of the battle. To replace them, large numbers of men were taken out of the frigates and distributed among the ships of the line. Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs and &quot;Railleur&quot; to act as decoys in the shallow waters. By 16:00, &quot;Alexander&quot; and &quot;Swiftsure&quot; were also in sight, although some distance from the main British fleet. Brueys gave orders to abandon the plan to remain at anchor and instead for his line to set sail. Blanquet protested the order on the grounds that there were not enough men aboard the French ships to both sail the ships and man the guns. Nelson gave orders for his leading ships to slow down, to allow the British fleet to approach in a more organised formation. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. He rescinded his earlier order to sail. Brueys may have been hoping that the delay would allow him to slip past the British during the night and thus follow Bonaparte&#x27;s orders not to engage the British fleet directly if he could avoid it.

Nelson ordered the fleet to slow down at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig &quot;springs&quot; on their anchor cables, a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their broadsides to face an enemy while stationary. It also increased manoeuvrability and therefore reduced the risk of coming under raking fire. Nelson&#x27;s plan, shaped through discussion with his senior captains during the return voyage to Alexandria, was to advance on the French and pass down the seaward side of the van and centre of the French line, so that each French ship would face two British ships and the massive &quot;Orient&quot; would be fighting against three. The direction of the wind meant that the French rear division would be unable to join the battle easily and would be cut off from the front portions of the line. To ensure that in the smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another, Nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at the head of their mizzen mast and hoist an illuminated White Ensign, which was different enough from the French tricolour that it would not be mistaken in poor visibility, reducing the risk that British ships might fire on one another in the darkness. As his ship was readied for battle, Nelson held a final dinner with &quot;Vanguard&quot;s officers, announcing as he rose: &quot;Before this time tomorrow I shall have gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey,&quot; in reference to the rewards of victory or the traditional burial place of British military heroes.
Shortly after the French order to set sail was abandoned, the British fleet began rapidly approaching once more. Brueys, now expecting to come under attack that night, ordered each of his ships to place springs on their anchor cables and prepare for action. He sent the &quot;Alerte&quot; ahead, which passed close to the leading British ships and then steered sharply to the west over the shoal, in the hope that the ships of the line might follow and become grounded. None of Nelson&#x27;s captains fell for the ruse and the British fleet continued undeterred. At 17:30, Nelson hailed one of his two leading ships, HMS &quot;Zealous&quot; under Captain Samuel Hood, which had been racing &quot;Goliath&quot; to be the first to fire on the French. The admiral ordered Hood to establish the safest course into the harbour. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map &quot;Swiftsure&quot; had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on &quot;Zealous&quot;, and a 35-year-old French map aboard &quot;Goliath&quot;. Hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test the depth of the water, and that, &quot;If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going.&quot; Shortly afterwards, Nelson paused to speak with the brig , whose commander, Lieutenant Thomas Hardy, had seized some maritime pilots from a small Alexandrine vessel. As &quot;Vanguard&quot; came to a stop, the following ships slowed. This caused a gap to open up between &quot;Zealous&quot; and &quot;Goliath&quot; and the rest of the fleet. To counter this effect, Nelson ordered under Captain Ralph Miller to pass his flagship and join &quot;Zealous&quot; and &quot;Goliath&quot; in the vanguard. By 18:00, the British fleet was again under full sail, &quot;Vanguard&quot; sixth in the line of ten ships as &quot;Culloden&quot; trailed behind to the north and &quot;Alexander&quot; and &quot;Swiftsure&quot; hastened to catch up to the west. Following the rapid change from a loose formation to a rigid line of battle, both fleets raised their colours; each British ship hoisted additional Union Flags in its rigging in case its main flag was shot away. At 18:20, as &quot;Goliath&quot; and &quot;Zealous&quot; rapidly bore down on them, the leading French ships &quot;Guerrier&quot; and opened fire.
Ten minutes after the French opened fire, &quot;Goliath&quot;, ignoring fire from the fort to starboard and from &quot;Guerrier&quot; to port, most of which was too high to trouble the ship, crossed the head of the French line. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between &quot;Guerrier&quot; and the shallow water of the shoal. On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap. As the bow of &quot;Guerrier&quot; came within range, &quot;Goliath&quot; opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of &quot;Guerrier.&quot; Foley&#x27;s Royal Marines and a company of Austrian grenadiers joined the attack, firing their muskets. Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed &quot;Guerrier&quot; entirely. &quot;Goliath&quot; eventually stopped close to the bow of &quot;Conquérant&quot;, opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate and bomb vessel &quot;Hercule&quot;, which were anchored inshore of the battle line.

Foley&#x27;s attack was followed by Hood in &quot;Zealous&quot;, who also crossed the French line and successfully anchored next to &quot;Guerrier&quot; in the space Foley had intended, engaging the lead ship&#x27;s bow from close range. Within five minutes &quot;Guerrier&quot;s foremast had fallen, to cheers from the crews of the approaching British ships. The speed of the British advance took the French captains by surprise; they were still aboard &quot;Orient&quot; in conference with the admiral when the firing started. Hastily launching their boats, they returned to their vessels. Captain Jean-François-Timothée Trullet of &quot;Guerrier&quot; shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on &quot;Zealous&quot;.

The third British ship into action was under Captain Sir James Saumarez, which rounded the engagement at the head of the battle line and passed between the French main line and the frigates that lay closer inshore. As he did so, the frigate &quot;Sérieuse&quot; opened fire on &quot;Orion&quot;, wounding two men. The convention in naval warfare of the time was that ships of the line did not attack frigates when there were ships of equal size to engage, but in firing first French Captain Claude-Jean Martin had negated the rule. Saumarez waited until the frigate was at close range before replying. &quot;Orion&quot; needed just one broadside to reduce the frigate to a wreck, and Martin&#x27;s disabled ship drifted away over the shoal. During the delay this detour caused, two other British ships joined the battle: &quot;Theseus&quot;, which had been disguised as a first-rate ship, followed Foley&#x27;s track across &quot;Guerrier&quot;s bow. Miller steered his ship through the middle of the melee between the anchored British and French ships until he encountered the third French ship, . Anchoring to port, Miller&#x27;s ship opened fire at close range. under Captain Davidge Gould crossed the French line between &quot;Guerrier&quot; and &quot;Conquérant&quot;, anchoring between the ships and raking them both. &quot;Orion&quot; then rejoined the action further south than intended, firing on the fifth French ship, &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot;, and Admiral Blanquet&#x27;s flagship, .

The next three British ships, &quot;Vanguard&quot; in the lead followed by and , remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40. Nelson focused his flagship&#x27;s fire on &quot;Spartiate&quot;, while Captain Thomas Louis in &quot;Minotaur&quot; attacked the unengaged and Captain John Peyton in &quot;Defence&quot; joined the attack on &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot;. With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered, the following British ships, and , passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre. Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than they and began to take severe damage. Captain Henry Darby on &quot;Bellerophon&quot; missed his intended anchor near &quot;Franklin&quot; and instead found his ship underneath the main battery of the French flagship. Captain George Blagdon Westcott on &quot;Majestic&quot; also missed his station and almost collided with &quot;Heureux&quot;, coming under heavy fire from . Unable to stop in time, Westcott&#x27;s jib boom became entangled with &quot;Tonnant&quot;″s shroud.

The French suffered too, Admiral Brueys on &quot;Orient&quot; was severely wounded in the face and hand by flying debris during the opening exchange of fire with &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. The final ship of the British line, &quot;Culloden&quot; under Troubridge, sailed too close to Aboukir Island in the growing darkness and became stuck fast on the shoal. Despite strenuous efforts from the &quot;Culloden&quot;s boats, the brig &quot;Mutine&quot; and the 50-gun under Captain Thomas Thompson, the ship of the line could not be moved, and the waves drove &quot;Culloden&quot; further onto the shoal, inflicting severe damage to the ship&#x27;s hull.

===Surrender of the French vanguard===
At 19:00 the identifying lights in the mizzenmasts of the British fleet were lit. By this time, &quot;Guerrier&quot; had been completely dismasted and heavily battered. &quot;Zealous&quot; by contrast was barely touched: Hood had situated &quot;Zealous&quot; outside the arc of most of the French ship&#x27;s broadsides, and in any case &quot;Guerrier&quot; was not prepared for an engagement on both sides simultaneously, with its port guns blocked by stores. Although their ship was a wreck, the crew of &quot;Guerrier&quot; refused to surrender, continuing to fire the few functional guns whenever possible despite heavy answering fire from &quot;Zealous&quot;. In addition to his cannon fire, Hood called up his marines and ordered them to fire volleys of musket shot at the deck of the French ship, driving the crew out of sight but still failing to secure the surrender from Captain Trullet. It was not until 21:00, when Hood sent a small boat to &quot;Guerrier&quot; with a boarding party, that the French ship finally surrendered. &quot;Conquérant&quot; was defeated more rapidly, after heavy broadsides from passing British ships and the close attentions of &quot;Audacious&quot; and &quot;Goliath&quot; brought down all three masts before 19:00. With his ship immobile and badly damaged, the mortally wounded Captain Etienne Dalbarade struck his colours and a boarding party seized control. Unlike &quot;Zealous&quot;, these British ships suffered relatively severe damage in the engagement. &quot;Goliath&quot; lost most of its rigging, suffered damage to all three masts and suffered more than 60 casualties. With his opponents defeated, Captain Gould on &quot;Audacious&quot; used the spring on his cable to transfer fire to &quot;Spartiate&quot;, the next French ship in line. To the west of the battle the battered &quot;Sérieuse&quot; sank over the shoal. Her masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore.

The transfer of &quot;Audacious&quot;s broadside to &quot;Spartiate&quot; meant that Captain Maurice-Julien Emeriau now faced three opponents. Within minutes all three of his ship&#x27;s masts had fallen, but the battle around &quot;Spartiate&quot; continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck. Although &quot;Spartiate&quot; was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line, &quot;Aquilon&quot;, which was the only ship of the French van squadron fighting a single opponent, &quot;Minotaur&quot;. Captain Antoine René Thévenard used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson&#x27;s flagship, which consequently suffered more than 100 casualties, including the admiral. At approximately 20:30, an iron splinter fired in a langrage shot from &quot;Spartiate &quot;struck Nelson over his blinded right eye. The wound caused a flap of skin to fall across his face, rendering him temporarily completely blind. Nelson collapsed into the arms of Captain Edward Berry and was carried below. Certain that his wound was fatal, he cried out &quot;I am killed, remember me to my wife&quot;, and called for his chaplain, Stephen Comyn. The wound was immediately inspected by &quot;Vanguard&quot;s surgeon Michael Jefferson, who informed the admiral that it was a simple flesh wound and stitched the skin together. Nelson subsequently ignored Jefferson&#x27;s instructions to remain inactive, returning to the quarterdeck shortly before the explosion on &quot;Orient&quot; to oversee the closing stages of the battle. Although Thévenard&#x27;s manoeuvre was successful, it placed his own bow under &quot;Minotaur&quot;″s guns and by 21:25 the French ship was dismasted and battered, Captain Thévenard killed and his junior officers forced to surrender. With his opponent defeated, Captain Thomas Louis then took &quot;Minotaur&quot; south to join the attack on &quot;Franklin&quot;.
&quot;Defence&quot; and &quot;Orion &quot;attacked the fifth French ship, &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot;, from either side and the ship rapidly lost the fore and main masts. Aboard the &quot;Orion&quot;, a wooden block was smashed off one of the ship&#x27;s masts, killing two men before wounding Captain Saumarez in the thigh. On &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot;, Captain Pierre-Paul Raccord was badly wounded and ordered his ship&#x27;s anchor cable cut in an effort to escape the bombardment. &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot; drifted south towards the flagship &quot;Orient&quot;, which mistakenly opened fire on the darkened vessel. &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Defence&quot; were unable to immediately pursue. &quot;Defence&quot; had lost its fore topmast and an improvised fireship that drifted through the battle narrowly missed &quot;Orion&quot;. The origin of this vessel, an abandoned and burning ship&#x27;s boat laden with highly flammable material, is uncertain, but it may have been launched from &quot;Guerrier&quot; as the battle began. &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot; anchored not far from &quot;Orient&quot;, but took no further part in the fighting. The wrecked ship surrendered during the night. &quot;Franklin&quot; remained in combat, but Blanquet had suffered a severe head wound and Captain Gillet had been carried below unconscious with severe wounds. Shortly afterwards, a fire broke out on the quarterdeck after an arms locker exploded, which was eventually extinguished with difficulty by the crew.

To the south, HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was in serious trouble as the huge broadside of &quot;Orient&quot; pounded the ship. At 19:50 the mizzenmast and main mast both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points. Although the blazes were extinguished, the ship had suffered more than 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from &quot;Tonnant&quot; as the foremast collapsed as well. &quot;Orient&quot; had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half. He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below. &quot;Orient&quot;s captain, Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca, was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious, while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he stood beside his father. The most southerly British ship, &quot;Majestic&quot;, had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun &quot;Tonnant&quot;, and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain George Blagdon Westcott was among the dead, killed by French musket fire. Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged &quot;Majestic&quot; to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between &quot;Tonnant&quot; and the next in line, &quot;Heureux&quot;, engaging both. To support the centre, Captain Thompson of &quot;Leander&quot; abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded &quot;Culloden&quot; off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot; and opening a fierce raking fire on &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Orient&quot;.
While the battle raged in the bay, the two straggling British ships made strenuous efforts to join the engagement, focusing on the flashes of gunfire in the darkness. Warned away from the Aboukir shoals by the grounded &quot;Culloden&quot;, Captain Benjamin Hallowell in &quot;Swiftsure&quot; passed the melee at the head of the line and aimed his ship at the French centre. Shortly after 20:00, a dismasted hulk was spotted drifting in front of &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and Hallowell initially ordered his men to fire before rescinding the order, concerned for the identity of the strange vessel. Hailing the battered ship, Hallowell received the reply &quot;&quot;Bellerophon&quot;, going out of action disabled.&quot; Relieved that he had not accidentally attacked one of his own ships in the darkness, Hallowell pulled up between &quot;Orient&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot; and opened fire on them both. &quot;Alexander&quot;, the final unengaged British ship, which had followed &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, pulled up close to &quot;Tonnant&quot;, which had begun to drift away from the embattled French flagship. Captain Alexander Ball then joined the attack on &quot;Orient&quot;.

===Destruction of &quot;L&#x27;Orient&quot;===

At 21:00, the British observed a fire on the lower decks of the &quot;Orient&quot;, the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the &quot;Orient&quot;, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship&#x27;s stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, &quot;Alexander&quot;, and &quot;Orion&quot;, all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship in anticipation of the detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships &quot;Tonnant&quot;, &quot;Heureux&quot;, and all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and the &quot;Orient&quot; was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, &quot;Alexander&quot;, and &quot;Franklin&quot;, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on &quot;Franklin&quot;.
It has never been firmly established how the fire on &quot;Orient&quot; broke out, but one common account is that jars of oil and paint had been left on the poop deck, instead of being properly stowed after painting of the ship&#x27;s hull had been completed shortly before the battle. Burning wadding from one of the British ships is believed to have floated onto the poop deck and ignited the paint. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral&#x27;s cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. Alternatively, Fleet Captain Honoré Ganteaume later reported the cause as an explosion on the quarterdeck, preceded by a series of minor fires on the main deck among the ship&#x27;s boats. Whatever its origin, the fire spread rapidly through the ship&#x27;s rigging, unchecked by the fire pumps aboard, which had been smashed by British shot. A second blaze then began at the bow, trapping hundreds of sailors in the ship&#x27;s waist. Subsequent archaeological investigation found debris scattered over of seabed and evidence that the ship was wracked by two explosions. Hundreds of men dived into the sea to escape the flames, but fewer than 100 survived the blast. British boats picked up approximately 70 survivors, including the wounded staff officer Léonard-Bernard Motard. A few others, including Ganteaume, managed to reach the shore on rafts. The remainder of the crew, numbering more than 1,000 men, were killed, including Captain Casabianca and his son, Giocante.

For ten minutes after the explosion there was no firing; sailors from both sides were either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of &quot;Orient&quot;. At 22:10, &quot;Franklin&quot; restarted the engagement by firing on &quot;Swiftsure&quot;. Isolated and battered, Blanquet&#x27;s ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Defence&quot;. More than half of &quot;Franklin&quot;s crew had been killed or wounded.

By midnight only &quot;Tonnant&quot; remained engaged, as Commodore Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars continued his fight with &quot;Majestic&quot; and fired on &quot;Swiftsure&quot; when the British ship moved within range. By 03:00, after more than three hours of close quarter combat, &quot;Majestic&quot; had lost its main and mizzen masts while &quot;Tonnant&quot; was a dismasted hulk. Although Captain Du Petit Thouars had lost both legs and an arm he remained in command, insisting on having the tricolour nailed to the mast to prevent it from being struck and giving orders from his position propped up on deck in a bucket of wheat. Under his guidance, the battered &quot;Tonnant&quot; gradually drifted southwards away from the action to join the southern division under Villeneuve, who failed to bring these ships into effective action. Throughout the engagement the French rear had kept up an arbitrary fire on the battling ships ahead. The only noticeable effect was the smashing of ″s rudder by misdirected fire from the neighbouring .

===Morning===

As the sun rose at 04:00 on 2 August, firing broke out once again between the French southern division of &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, &quot;Tonnant&quot;, &quot;Généreux&quot; and &quot;Timoléon&quot; and the battered &quot;Alexander&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;. Although briefly outmatched, the British ships were soon joined by &quot;Goliath&quot; and &quot;Theseus&quot;. As Captain Miller manoeuvred his ship into position, &quot;Theseus&quot; briefly came under fire from the frigate . Miller turned his ship towards &quot;Artémise&quot;, but Captain Pierre-Jean Standelet struck his flag and ordered his men to abandon the frigate. Miller sent a boat under Lieutenant William Hoste to take possession of the empty vessel, but Standelet had set fire to his ship as he left and &quot;Artémise&quot; blew up shortly afterwards. The surviving French ships of the line, covering their retreat with gunfire, gradually pulled to the east away from the shore at 06:00. &quot;Zealous&quot; pursued, and was able to prevent the frigate from boarding &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, which was anchored at the southern point of the bay undergoing hasty repairs.

Two other French ships still flew the tricolour, but neither was in a position to either retreat or fight. When &quot;Heureux&quot; and &quot;Mercure&quot; had cut their anchor cables to escape the exploding &quot;Orient&quot;, their crews had panicked and neither captain (both of whom were wounded) had managed to regain control of his ship. As a result, both vessels had drifted onto the shoal. &quot;Alexander&quot;, &quot;Goliath&quot;, &quot;Theseus&quot; and &quot;Leander&quot; attacked the stranded and defenceless ships, and both surrendered within minutes. The distractions provided by &quot;Heureux&quot;, &quot;Mercure&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; allowed Villeneuve to bring most of the surviving French ships to the mouth of the bay at 11:00. On the dismasted &quot;Tonnant&quot;, Commodore Du Petit Thouars was now dead from his wounds and thrown overboard at his own request. As the ship was unable to make the required speed it was driven ashore by its crew. &quot;Timoléon&quot; was too far south to escape with Villeneuve and, in attempting to join the survivors, had also grounded on the shoal. The force of the impact dislodged the ship&#x27;s foremast. The remaining French vessels—the ships of the line &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; and &quot;Généreux&quot; and the frigates &quot;Justice&quot; and —formed up and stood out to sea, pursued by &quot;Zealous&quot;. Despite strenuous efforts, Captain Hood&#x27;s isolated ship came under heavy fire and was unable to cut off the trailing &quot;Justice&quot; as the French survivors escaped seawards. &quot;Zealous&quot; was struck by a number of French shot and lost one man killed.

For the remainder of 2 August Nelson&#x27;s ships made improvised repairs and boarded and consolidated their prizes. &quot;Culloden&quot; especially required assistance. Troubridge, having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than of water an hour. Emergency repairs to the hull and fashioning a replacement rudder from a spare topmast took most of the next two days. On the morning of 3 August, Nelson sent &quot;Theseus&quot; and &quot;Leander&quot; to force the surrender of the grounded &quot;Tonnant&quot; and &quot;Timoléon&quot;. The &quot;Tonnant&quot;, its decks crowded with 1,600 survivors from other French vessels, surrendered as the British ships approached while &quot;Timoléon&quot; was set on fire by its remaining crew who then escaped to the shore in small boats. &quot;Timoléon&quot; exploded shortly after midday, the eleventh and final French ship of the line destroyed or captured during the battle.

==Aftermath==

British casualties in the battle were recorded with some accuracy in the immediate aftermath as 218 killed and approximately 677 wounded, although the number of wounded who subsequently died is not known. The ships that suffered most were &quot;Bellerophon&quot; with 201 casualties and &quot;Majestic&quot; with 193. Other than &quot;Culloden&quot; the lightest loss was on &quot;Zealous&quot;, which had one man killed and seven wounded.

The casualty list included Captain Westcott, five lieutenants and ten junior officers among the dead, and Admiral Nelson, Captains Saumarez, Ball and Darby, and six lieutenants wounded. Other than &quot;Culloden&quot;, the only British ships seriously damaged in their hulls were &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, &quot;Majestic,&quot; and &quot;Vanguard&quot;. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; were the only ships to lose masts: &quot;Majestic&quot; the main and mizzen and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; all three.

French casualties are harder to calculate but were significantly higher. Estimates of French losses range from 2,000 to 5,000, with a suggested median point of 3,500, which includes more than 1,000 captured wounded and nearly 2,000 killed, half of whom died on &quot;Orient&quot;. In addition to Admiral Brueys killed and Admiral Blanquet wounded, four captains died and seven others were seriously wounded. The French ships suffered severe damage: Two ships of the line and two frigates were destroyed (as well as a bomb vessel scuttled by its crew), and three other captured ships were too battered ever to sail again. Of the remaining prizes, only three were ever sufficiently repaired for frontline service. For weeks after the battle, bodies washed up along the Egyptian coast, decaying slowly in the intense, dry heat.

Nelson, who on surveying the bay on the morning of 2 August said, &quot;Victory is not a name strong enough for such a scene&quot;, remained at anchor in Aboukir Bay for the next two weeks, preoccupied with recovering from his wound, writing dispatches, and assessing the military situation in Egypt using documents captured on board one of the prizes. Nelson&#x27;s head wound was recorded as being &quot;three inches long&quot; with &quot;the cranium exposed for one inch&quot;. He suffered pain from the injury for the rest of his life and was badly scarred, styling his hair to disguise it as much as possible. As their commander recovered, his men stripped the wrecks of useful supplies and made repairs to their ships and prizes.

Throughout the week, Aboukir Bay was surrounded by bonfires lit by Bedouin tribesmen in celebration of the British victory. On 5 August, &quot;Leander&quot; was despatched to Cadiz with messages for Earl St. Vincent carried by Captain Edward Berry. Over the next few days the British landed all but 200 of the captured prisoners on shore under strict terms of parole, although Bonaparte later ordered them to be formed into an infantry unit and added to his army. The wounded officers taken prisoner were held on board &quot;Vanguard&quot;, where Nelson regularly entertained them at dinner. Historian Joseph Allen recounts that on one occasion Nelson, whose eyesight was still suffering following his wound, offered toothpicks to an officer who had lost his teeth and then passed a snuff-box to an officer whose nose had been torn off, causing much embarrassment. On 8 August the fleet&#x27;s boats stormed Aboukir Island, which surrendered without a fight. The landing party removed four of the guns and destroyed the rest along with the fort they were mounted in, renaming the island &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Island&quot;.

On 10 August, Nelson sent Lieutenant Thomas Duval from &quot;Zealous&quot; with messages to the government in India. Duval travelled across the Middle East overland via camel train to Aleppo and took the East India Company ship &quot;Fly&quot; from Basra to Bombay, acquainting Governor-General of India Viscount Wellesley with the situation in Egypt. On 12 August the frigates under Captain Thomas Moutray Waller and under Captain George Johnstone Hope, and the sloop under Captain Robert Retalick, arrived off Alexandria. Initially the British mistook the frigate squadron for French warships and &quot;Swiftsure&quot; chased them away. They returned the following day once the error had been realised. The same day as the frigates arrived, Nelson sent &quot;Mutine&quot; to Britain with dispatches, under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Bladen Capel, who had replaced Hardy after the latter&#x27;s promotion to captain of &quot;Vanguard&quot;. On 14 August, Nelson sent &quot;Orion&quot;, &quot;Majestic&quot;, &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, &quot;Minotaur&quot;, &quot;Defence&quot;, &quot;Audacious&quot;, &quot;Theseus&quot;, &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Tonnant&quot;, &quot;Aquilon&quot;, &quot;Conquérant&quot;, &quot;Peuple Souverain,&quot; and &quot;Spartiate&quot; to sea under the command of Saumarez. Many ships had only jury masts and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August. On 16 August the British burned and destroyed the grounded prize &quot;Heureux&quot; as no longer fit for service and on 18 August also burned &quot;Guerrier&quot; and &quot;Mercure&quot;. On 19 August, Nelson sailed for Naples with &quot;Vanguard&quot;, &quot;Culloden,&quot; and &quot;Alexander&quot;, leaving Hood in command of &quot;Zealous&quot;, &quot;Goliath&quot;, &quot;Swiftsure,&quot; and the recently joined frigates to watch over French activities at Alexandria.

The first message to reach Bonaparte regarding the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his camp on the road between Salahieh and Cairo. The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General Jean Baptiste Kléber, and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve&#x27;s ships at sea. One account reports that when he was handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced &quot;Nous n&#x27;avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens&quot; (&quot;We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients&quot;). Another story, as told by the general&#x27;s secretary, Bourienne, claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed &quot;Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!&quot; Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering &quot;Franklin&quot; while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity. Bonaparte&#x27;s most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were &quot;marvellous,&quot; Bonaparte responded that it was just as well, since he would have them shot if they continued &quot;fostering mutinies and preaching revolt.&quot; To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.

===Reaction===
Nelson&#x27;s first set of dispatches were captured when &quot;Leander&quot; was intercepted and defeated by &quot;Généreux&quot; in a fierce engagement off the western shore of Crete on 18 August 1798. As a result, reports of the battle did not reach Britain until Capel arrived in &quot;Mutine&quot; on 2 October, entering the Admiralty at 11:15 and personally delivering the news to Lord Spencer, who collapsed unconscious when he heard the report. Although Nelson had previously been castigated in the press for failing to intercept the French fleet, rumours of the battle had begun to arrive in Britain from the continent in late September and the news Capel brought was greeted with celebrations right across the country. Within four days Nelson had been elevated to Baron Nelson of the Nile and Burnham Thorpe, a title with which he was privately dissatisfied, believing his actions deserved better reward. King George III addressed the Houses of Parliament on 20 November with the words:

Saumarez&#x27;s convoy of prizes stopped first at Malta, where Saumarez provided assistance to a rebellion on the island among the Maltese population. It then sailed to Gibraltar, arriving on 18 October to the cheers of the garrison. Saumarez wrote that, &quot;We can never do justice to the warmth of their applause, and the praises they all bestowed on our squadron.&quot; On 23 October, following the transfer of the wounded to the military hospital and provision of basic supplies, the convoy sailed on towards Lisbon, leaving &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; behind for more extensive repairs. &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot; also remained at Gibraltar: The ship was deemed too badly damaged for the Atlantic voyage to Britain and so was converted to a guardship under the name of HMS &quot;Guerrier&quot;. The remaining prizes underwent basic repairs and then sailed for Britain, spending some months at the Tagus and joining with the annual merchant convoy from Portugal in June 1799 under the escort of a squadron commanded by Admiral Sir Alan Gardner, before eventually arriving at Plymouth. Their age and battered state meant that neither &quot;Conquérant&quot; nor &quot;Aquilon&quot; were considered fit for active service in the Royal Navy and both were subsequently hulked, although they had been bought into the service for £20,000 (the equivalent of £ million as of ) each as HMS &quot;Conquerant&quot; and HMS &quot;Aboukir&quot; to provide a financial reward to the crews that had captured them. Similar sums were also paid out for &quot;Guerrier&quot;, &quot;Mercure&quot;, &quot;Heureux&quot; and &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot;, while the other captured ships were worth considerably more. Constructed of Adriatic oak, &quot;Tonnant&quot; had been built in 1792 and &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Spartiate&quot; were less than a year old. &quot;Tonnant&quot; and &quot;Spartiate&quot;, both of which later fought at the Battle of Trafalgar, joined the Royal Navy under their old names while &quot;Franklin&quot;, considered to be &quot;the finest two-decked ship in the world&quot;, was renamed HMS &quot;Canopus&quot;. The total value of the prizes captured at the Nile and subsequently bought into the Royal Navy was estimated at just over £130,000 (the equivalent of £ million as of ).
Additional awards were presented to the British fleet: Nelson was awarded £2,000 (£ as of ) a year for life by the Parliament of Great Britain and £1,000 per annum by the Parliament of Ireland, although the latter was inadvertently discontinued after the Act of Union dissolved the Irish Parliament. Both parliaments gave unanimous votes of thanks, each captain who served in the battle was presented with a specially minted gold medal and the first lieutenant of every ship engaged in the battle was promoted to commander. Troubridge and his men, initially excluded, received equal shares in the awards after Nelson personally interceded for the crew of the stranded &quot;Culloden, &quot;even though they did not directly participate in the engagement. The Honourable East India Company presented Nelson with £10,000 (£ as of ) in recognition of the benefit his action had on their holdings and the cities of London, Liverpool and other municipal and corporate bodies made similar awards. Nelson&#x27;s own captains presented him with a sword and a portrait as &quot;proof of their esteem.&quot; Nelson publicly encouraged this close bond with his officers and on 29 September 1798 described them as &quot;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers&quot;, echoing William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry V&quot;. From this grew the notion of the Nelsonic Band of Brothers, a cadre of high-quality naval officers that served with Nelson for the remainder of his life. Nearly five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.

Other rewards were bestowed by foreign states, particularly the Ottoman Emperor Selim III, who made Nelson the first Knight Commander of the newly created Order of the Crescent, and presented him with a chelengk, a diamond studded rose, a sable fur and numerous other valuable presents. Tsar Paul I of Russia sent, among other rewards, a gold box studded with diamonds, and similar gifts in silver arrived from other European rulers. On his return to Naples, Nelson was greeted with a triumphal procession led by King Ferdinand IV and Sir William Hamilton and was introduced for only the third time to Sir William&#x27;s wife Emma, Lady Hamilton, who fainted violently at the meeting, and apparently took several weeks to recover from her injuries. Lauded as a hero by the Neapolitan court, Nelson was later to dabble in Neapolitan politics and become the Duke of Bronté, actions for which he was criticised by his superiors and his reputation suffered. British general John Moore, who met Nelson in Naples at this time, described him as &quot;covered with stars, medals and ribbons, more like a Prince of Opera than the Conqueror of the Nile.&quot;

Rumours of a battle first appeared in the French press as early as 7 August, although credible reports did not arrive until 26 August, and even these claimed that Nelson was dead and Bonaparte a British prisoner. When the news became certain, the French press insisted that the defeat was the result both of an overwhelmingly large British force and unspecified &quot;traitors.&quot; Among the anti-government journals in France, the defeat was blamed on the incompetence of the French Directory and on supposed lingering Royalist sentiments in the Navy. Villeneuve came under scathing attack on his return to France for his failure to support Brueys during the battle. In his defence, he pleaded that the wind had been against him and that Brueys had not issued orders for him to counterattack the British fleet. Writing many years later, Bonaparte commented that if the French Navy had adopted the same tactical principles as the British:

By contrast, the British press were jubilant; many newspapers sought to portray the battle as a victory for Britain over anarchy, and the success was used to attack the supposedly pro-republican Whig politicians Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan.

In the United States, the outcome of the battle led President John Adams to pursue diplomacy with France to end the Quasi-War, as the French naval defeat rendered the prospect of an invasion of the United States less likely.

There has been extensive historiographical debate over the comparative strengths of the fleets, although they were ostensibly evenly matched in size, each containing 13 ships of the line. However, the loss of &quot;Culloden&quot;, the relative sizes of &quot;Orient&quot; and &quot;Leander&quot; and the participation in the action by two of the French frigates and several smaller vessels, as well as the theoretical strength of the French position, leads most historians to the conclusion that the French were marginally more powerful. This is accentuated by the weight of broadside of several of the French ships: &quot;Spartiate&quot;, &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Orient&quot;, &quot;Tonnant&quot; and &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; were each significantly larger than any individual British ship in the battle. However inadequate deployment, reduced crews, and the failure of the rear division under Villeneuve to meaningfully participate, all contributed to the French defeat.

===Effects===
The Battle of the Nile has been called &quot;arguably, the most decisive naval engagement of the great age of sail&quot;, and &quot;the most splendid and glorious success which the British Navy gained.&quot; Historian and novelist C. S. Forester, writing in 1929, compared the Nile to the great naval actions in history and concluded that &quot;it still only stands rivalled by Tsu-Shima as an example of the annihilation of one fleet by another of approximately equal material force&quot;. The effect on the strategic situation in the Mediterranean was immediate, reversing the balance of the conflict and giving the British control at sea that they maintained for the remainder of the war. The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet allowed the Royal Navy to return to the sea in force, as British squadrons set up blockades off French and allied ports. In particular, British ships cut Malta off from France, aided by the rebellion among the native Maltese population that forced the French garrison to retreat to Valletta and shut the gates. The ensuing siege of Malta lasted for two years before the defenders were finally starved into surrender. In 1799, British ships harassed Bonaparte&#x27;s army as it marched east and north through Palestine, and played a crucial part in Bonaparte&#x27;s defeat at the siege of Acre, when the barges carrying the siege train were captured and the French storming parties were bombarded by British ships anchored offshore. It was during one of these latter engagements that Captain Miller of &quot;Theseus&quot; was killed in an ammunition explosion. The defeat at Acre forced Bonaparte to retreat to Egypt and effectively ended his efforts to carve an empire in the Middle East. The French general returned to France without his army late in the year, leaving Kléber in command of Egypt.

The Ottoman Empire, with whom Bonaparte had hoped to conduct an alliance once his control of Egypt was complete, was encouraged by the Battle of the Nile to go to war against France. This led to a series of campaigns that slowly sapped the strength from the French army trapped in Egypt. The British victory also encouraged the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire, both of whom were mustering armies as part of a Second Coalition, which declared war on France in 1799. With the Mediterranean undefended, an Imperial Russian Navy fleet entered the Ionian Sea, while Austrian armies recaptured much of the Italian territory lost to Bonaparte in the previous war. Without their best general and his veterans, the French suffered a series of defeats and it was not until Bonaparte returned to become First Consul that France once again held a position of strength on Continental Europe. In 1801 a British Expeditionary Force defeated the demoralised remains of the French army in Egypt. The Royal Navy used its dominance in the Mediterranean to invade Egypt without the fear of ambush while anchored off the Egyptian coast.

In spite of the overwhelming British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian Edward Ingram noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue the war in the Middle East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The potential of a successful engagement at sea to change the course of history is underscored by the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Auguste de Marmont, Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, Louis Desaix, Jean Reynier, Antoine-François Andréossy, Jean-Andoche Junot, Louis-Nicolas Davout and Dumas were all passengers on the cramped Mediterranean crossing.

===Legacy===
The Battle of the Nile remains one of the Royal Navy&#x27;s most famous victories, and has remained prominent in the British popular imagination, sustained by its depiction in a large number of cartoons, paintings, poems, and plays. One of the best known poems about the battle is &quot;Casabianca&quot;, which was written by Felicia Dorothea Hemans in 1826 and gives a fictional account of the actual death of the French Captain Casabianca&#x27;s son on &quot;Orient&quot;, i.e. the boy who famously &quot;stood on the burning deck&quot; was French.

Monuments were raised, including Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle in London. Muhammad Ali of Egypt gave the monument in 1819 in recognition of the battle of 1798 and the campaign of 1801 but Great Britain did not erect it on the Victoria Embankment until 1878. Another memorial, the Nile Clumps near Amesbury, consists of stands of beech trees purportedly planted by Lord Queensbury at the behest of Lady Hamilton and Thomas Hardy after Nelson&#x27;s death. The trees form a plan of the battle; each clump represents the position of a British or French ship.

On the Hall Place estate, Burchetts Green, Berkshire (now Berkshire College of Agriculture), a double line of oak trees, each tree representing a ship of the opposing fleets, was planted by William East, Baronet, in celebration of the victory. He also constructed a scale-sized pyramid and a life-sized statue of Nelson on the highest point of the estate.

The composer Joseph Haydn had just completed the Missa in Angustiis (mass for troubled times) after Napoleon Bonaparte had defeated the Austrian army in four major battles. The well received news of France&#x27;s defeat at the Nile however resulted in the mass gradually acquiring the nickname &quot;Lord Nelson Mass&quot;. The title became indelible when, in 1800, Nelson himself visited the Palais Esterházy, accompanied by his mistress, Lady Hamilton, and may have heard the mass performed.

The Royal Navy commemorated the battle with the ship names , and , and in 1998 commemorated the 200th anniversary of the battle with a visit to Aboukir Bay by the modern frigate , whose crew laid wreaths in memory of those who lost their lives in the battle.

In John le Carré&#x27;s novel Smiley&#x27;s People there is mention of a bar on Battle of the Nile Street named &#x27;The Defeated Frog&#x27;.

==== Archaeology ====
Although Nelson biographer Ernle Bradford assumed in 1977 that the remains of &quot;Orient&quot; &quot;are almost certainly unrecoverable,&quot; the first archaeological investigation into the battle began in 1983, when a French survey team under Jacques Dumas discovered the wreck of the French flagship. Franck Goddio later took over the work, leading a major project to explore the bay in 1998. He found that material was scattered over an area in diameter. In addition to military and nautical equipment, Goddio recovered a large number of gold and silver coins from countries across the Mediterranean, some from the 17th century. It is likely that these were part of the treasure taken from Malta that was lost in the explosion aboard &quot;Orient&quot;. In 2000, Italian archaeologist Paolo Gallo led an excavation focusing on ancient ruins on Nelson&#x27;s Island. It uncovered a number of graves that date from the battle, as well as others buried there during the 1801 invasion. These graves, which included a woman and three children, were relocated in 2005 to a cemetery at Shatby in Alexandria. The reburial was attended by sailors from the modern frigate and a band from the Egyptian Navy, as well as a descendant of the only identified burial, Commander James Russell.

<doc id="4607" wikidata="Q185856" url="?curid=4607" title="Barnabas">
<text>Barnabas (; ; ), born Joseph () or Joses (), was according to tradition an early Christian, one of the prominent Christian disciples in Jerusalem. According to Acts 4:36, Barnabas was a Cypriot Levite. Identified as an apostle in Acts 14:14, he and Paul the Apostle undertook missionary journeys together and defended Gentile converts against the Judaizers. They traveled together making more converts ( AD), and participated in the Council of Jerusalem ( AD). Barnabas and Paul successfully evangelized among the &quot;God-fearing&quot; Gentiles who attended synagogues in various Hellenized cities of Anatolia.

Barnabas&#x27; story appears in the Acts of the Apostles, and Paul mentions him in some of his epistles. Tertullian named him as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, but this and other attributions are conjecture. The Epistle of Barnabas was ascribed to him by Clement of Alexandria and others in the early church and the epistle is included under his name in Codex Sinaiticus, the earliest extant manuscript of the complete New Testament. A few modern scholars concur with this traditional attribution but it is presently a minority view.

Although the date, place, and circumstances of his death are historically unverifiable, Christian tradition holds that Barnabas was martyred at Salamis, Cyprus. He is traditionally identified as the founder of the Cypriot Orthodox Church. The feast day of Barnabas is celebrated on 11 June.

Barnabas is usually identified as the cousin of Mark the Evangelist on the basis of the term used in Colossians 4, which carries the connotation of &quot;cousin&quot;. Orthodox tradition holds that Aristobulus of Britannia, one of the Seventy Disciples, was the brother of Barnabas.

== Name and etymologies ==
His Hellenic Jewish parents called him Joseph (although the Byzantine text-type calls him , , &#x27;Joses&#x27;, a Greek variant of &#x27;Joseph&#x27;), but when recounting the story of how he sold his land and gave the money to the apostles in Jerusalem, the Book of Acts says the apostles called him Barnabas. (The &quot;s&quot; at the end is the Greek nominative case ending, and it is not present in the Aramaic form.) The Greek text of Acts 4:36 explains the name as , , meaning &quot;son of encouragement&quot; or &quot;son of comforter&quot;. One theory is that this is from the Aramaic , , meaning &#x27;son (of) prophet&#x27;. Another is that it is related to the Hebrew word (, Aramaic ) meaning &quot;prophet&quot;. In the Syriac Bible, the phrase &quot;son of prophet&quot; is translated .

== Biblical narrative ==

Barnabas appears mainly in Acts, a history of the early Christian church. He also appears in several of Paul&#x27;s epistles.

Barnabas, a native of Cyprus and a Levite, is first mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as a member of the early Christian community in Jerusalem, who sold the land that he owned and gave the proceeds to the community. When the future Paul the Apostle returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas introduced him to the apostles. Easton, in his Bible Dictionary, supposes that they had been fellow students in the school of Gamaliel.

The successful preaching of Christianity at Antioch to non-Jews led the church at Jerusalem to send Barnabas there to oversee the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Paul (still referred to as Saul), &quot;an admirable colleague&quot;, to assist him. Paul returned with him to Antioch and labored with him for a whole year. At the end of this period, the two were sent up to Jerusalem (44 AD) with contributions from the church at Antioch for the relief of the poorer Christians in Judea.

They returned to Antioch taking John Mark with them, the cousin or nephew of Barnabas. Later, they went to Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. After recounting what the governor of Cyprus Sergius Paulus believed, Acts 13:9 speaks of Barnabas&#x27;s spiritual brother no longer as Saul, but as Paul, his Roman name. From that point forward, when Acts refers to the two as a pair, it generally no longer uses &quot;Barnabas and Saul&quot;, but &quot;Paul and Barnabas&quot;. Only in Acts 14:14 and Acts 15:12,25 does Barnabas again occupy the first place; in Acts 14:14 with reference to Barnabas being mentioned first two verses earlier in Acts 14:12, and in Acts 15:12,25, because Barnabas stood in closer relation to the Jerusalem church than Paul. Paul appears as the more eloquent missionary, whence the Lystrans regarded him as Hermes and Barnabas as Zeus.

Acts 14:14 is also the only biblical verse where Barnabas is referred to using the Greek word for Apostle.

Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church. According to Galatians 2:9–10, Barnabas was included with Paul in the agreement made between them, on the one hand, and James, Peter, and John, on the other, that the two former should in the future preach to the pagans, not forgetting the poor at Jerusalem. This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the agreement of the council that Gentiles were to be admitted into the church without having to adopt Jewish practices.

After Paul and Barnabas returned from the Jerusalem council to Antioch, Peter also came to Antioch. Peter associated freely with the Gentiles there, including eating with them, until he was criticized for this by some disciples of James, as doing so was contrary to Mosaic law. Peter then refused to eat any longer with the Gentiles, apparently through fear of displeasing these disciples, and Barnabas followed his example. Paul then stated that Peter and Barnabas &quot;walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel&quot; (Galatians 2:14) and upbraided them before the whole church. In Galatians 2:11–13, Paul says, &quot;And when Kephas [Peter] came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he clearly was wrong. For, until some people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separated himself, because he was afraid of the circumcised. And the rest of the Jews (also) acted hypocritically along with him, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.&quot;

Paul then asked Barnabas to accompany him on another journey. Barnabas wished to take John Mark along, but Paul did not, as John Mark had left them on the earlier journey. The dispute ended by Paul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Paul took Silas as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and Cilicia; while Barnabas took John Mark to visit Cyprus.

Little is known of the subsequent career of Barnabas. He was still living and labouring as an Apostle in 56 or 57 AD, when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians (1 Corinthians 9:5–6), in which it is stated that he, too, like Paul, earned his own living. The reference indicates also that the friendship between the two was unimpaired. A few years later, when Paul was a prisoner in Rome (61–63 AD), John Mark was attached to him as a disciple, which is regarded as an indication that Barnabas was no longer living (Colossians 4:10).

== Barnabas and Antioch ==
Antioch, the third-most important city of the Roman Empire after Rome and Alexandria, then the capital city of Syria province, today Antakya, Turkey, was where Christians were first called thus.

Some of those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose because of Stephen went to Antioch, which became the site of an early Christian community. A considerable minority of the Antioch church of Barnabas&#x27;s time belonged to the merchant class, and they provided support to the poorer Jerusalem church.

== Martyrdom ==
Church tradition developed outside of the canon of the New Testament describes the martyrdom of many saints, including the legend of the martyrdom of Barnabas. It relates that certain Jews coming to Syria and Salamis, where Barnabas was then preaching the gospel, being highly exasperated at his extraordinary success, fell upon him as he was disputing in the synagogue, dragged him out, and stoned him to death. His kinsman, John Mark, privately interred his body.

Although it is believed he was martyred by being stoned, the apocryphal Acts of Barnabas states that he was bound with a rope by the neck, and then being dragged only to the site where he would be burned to death.

According to the &quot;History of the Cyprus Church&quot;, in 478 Barnabas appeared in a dream to the Archbishop Anthemios of Cyprus and revealed to him the place of his sepulchre beneath a carob-tree. The following day Anthemios found the tomb and inside it the remains of Barnabas with a manuscript of Matthew&#x27;s Gospel on his breast. Anthemios presented the Gospel to Emperor Zeno at Constantinople and received from him the privileges of the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus, that is, the purple cloak which the Greek Archbishop of Cyprus wears at festivals of the church, the imperial sceptre and the red ink with which he affixes his signature.

Anthemios then placed the venerable remains of Barnabas in a church which he founded near the tomb. Excavations near the site of a present-day church and monastery, have revealed an early church with two empty tombs, believed to be that of St. Barnabas and Anthemios.

St. Barnabas is venerated as the patron saint of Cyprus. He is also considered a patron saint in many other places in the world, highlighting 
Milan in Italy. On the island of Tenerife (Spain), St. Barnabas was invoked in historical times as patron saint and protector of the island&#x27;s fields against drought, together with St. Benedict of Nursia.

Barnabas the Apostle is remembered in the Church of England with a festival on 11 June.

==Other sources==
Although many assume that the biblical Mark the cousin of Barnabas is the same as John Mark and Mark the Evangelist, the traditionally believed author of the Gospel of Mark, they are listed as three distinct people in Pseudo-Hippolytus&#x27; &quot;On the Seventy Apostles of Christ,&quot; which includes Barnabas himself as one of the Seventy-Two Disciples. There are two people named Barnabas among Hippolytus&#x27; list of Seventy Disciples, One (#13) became the bishop of Milan, the other (#25) the bishop of Heraclea. Most likely one of these two is the biblical Barnabas; the first one is more likely, because the numbering by Hippolytus seems to indicate a level of significance, and Barnabas is traditionally credited with founding the apostolic see of Milan. Clement of Alexandria also makes Barnabas one of the Seventy Disciples that are mentioned in the Gospel of Luke.

Other sources bring Barnabas to Rome and Alexandria. In the &quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot; (i, 7) he is depicted as preaching in Rome even during Christ&#x27;s lifetime.

Cypriots developed the tradition of his later activity and martyrdom no earlier than the 3rd century. The question whether Barnabas was an apostle was often discussed during the Middle Ages.

== Alleged writings ==
Tertullian and other Western writers regard Barnabas as the author of the Letter to the Hebrews. This may have been the Roman tradition—which Tertullian usually follows—and in Rome the epistle may have had its first readers. Modern biblical scholarship considers its authorship unknown, though Barnabas amongst others has been proposed as potential authors.

&quot;Photius of the ninth century, refers to some in his day who were uncertain whether the Acts was written by Clement of Rome, Barnabas, or Luke. Yet Photius is certain that the work must be ascribed to Luke.&quot;

He is also traditionally associated with the Epistle of Barnabas, although some modern scholars think it more likely that the epistle was written in Alexandria in the 130s.

The 5th century &quot;Decretum Gelasianum&quot; includes a &quot;Gospel of Barnabas&quot; amongst works condemned as apocryphal; but no certain text or quotation from this work has been identified.

Another book using that same title, the Gospel of Barnabas, survives in two post-medieval manuscripts in Italian and Spanish. Contrary to the canonical Christian Gospels, and in accordance with the Islamic view of Jesus, this later Gospel of Barnabas states that Jesus was not the son of God, but a prophet and messenger.

==The Barnabites==
In 1538, the Catholic religious order officially known as &quot;Clerics Regular of St. Paul&quot; (&quot;Clerici Regulares Sancti Pauli&quot;), gained the grand old Monastery of Saint Barnabas by the city wall of Milan as their main seat. The Order was thenceforth known by the popular name of &quot;Barnabites&quot;.

<text>Birka (&quot;Birca&quot; in medieval sources), on the island of Björkö (lit. &quot;Birch Island&quot;) in present-day Sweden, was an important Viking Age trading center which handled goods from Scandinavia as well as many parts of Continental Europe and the Orient. Björkö is located in Lake Mälaren, 30 kilometers west of contemporary Stockholm, in the municipality of Ekerö.

Birka was founded around AD 750 and it flourished for more than 200 years. It was abandoned c. AD 975, around the same time Sigtuna was founded as a Christian town some 35 km to the northeast. It has been estimated that the population in Viking Age Birka was between 500 and 1000 people.

The archaeological sites of Birka and Hovgården, on the neighbouring island of Adelsö, make up an archaeological complex which illustrates the elaborate trading networks of Viking Scandinavia and their influence on the subsequent history of Europe. Generally regarded as Sweden&#x27;s oldest town, Birka (along with Hovgården) has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993. Many burial sites have been uncovered at Birka, leading to the finding of many objects including jewelry and many textile fragments. In recent years, objects from Birka have been in the public eye due to ongoing academic research connection Birka to evidence of trade with the Middle East.

==History==


Birka was founded around 750 AD as a trading port by a king or merchants trying to control trade. It is one of the earliest urban settlements in Scandinavia. Birka was the Baltic link in the Dnieper Trade Route through Ladoga (&quot;Aldeigja&quot;) and Novgorod (&quot;Holmsgard&quot;) to the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate. Birka is the site of the first known Christian in Sweden, founded in 831 by Saint Ansgar.

As a trading center, Birka most likely offered furs, iron goods, and craft products, in exchange for various materials from much of Europe and Western Asia. Furs were obtained from the Sami people, the Finns, and people in Northwestern Russia, as well as from local trappers. Furs included bear, fox, marten, otter, beaver, and other species. Reindeer antlers and objects carved from reindeer antlers like combs were important items of trade. The trade of walrus tusks, amber, and honey is also documented.

Foreign goods found from the graves of Birka include glass and metalware, pottery from the Rhineland, clothing and textiles including Chinese silk, Byzantine embroidery with extremely fine gold thread, brocades with gold passementerie, and plaited cords of high quality. From the ninth century onwards coins minted at Haithabu in Northern Germany and elsewhere in Scandinavia start to appear. However, the vast majority of the coins found at Birka are silver dirhams from the Middle East while English and Carolingian coins are rare.

== Written accounts ==
Sources from Birka are mainly archaeological remains. No texts survive from this area, though the written text &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot; (&quot;The Life of Ansgar&quot;) by Rimbert (c. 865) describes the missionary work of Ansgar around 830 at Birka, and &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum&quot; (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) by Adam of Bremen in 1075 describes the Archbishop Unni, who died at Birka in 936. Saint Ansgar&#x27;s work was the first attempt to convert the people of Birka from the Norse religion to Christianity. It was unsuccessful.

Both Rimbert and Adam were German clergymen writing in Latin. There are no known Norse sources mentioning the name of the settlement, or even the settlement itself, and the original Norse name of Birka is unknown. &quot;Birca&quot; is the Latinised form given in the written sources by Rimbert and Adam; and &quot;Birka&quot; is the contemporary, unhistorical Swedish form. The Latin name is probably derived from an Old Norse word &quot;birk&quot; which probably means a market place. Related to this was the &quot;Bjärköa law&quot; (bjärköarätt) which regulated the life of market places in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Birka and similar spellings are very common in Scandinavian place names still today leading to speculation that all references to Birka, especially those by Adam of Bremen, were not about the same location.

Both publications are silent on Birka&#x27;s size, layout, and appearance. Based on Rimbert&#x27;s account, Birka was significant because it had a port and it was the location of the regional ting. Adam only mentions the port, but otherwise, Birka seems to have been significant to him because it was the start of Ansgar&#x27;s Christian mission and because Archbishop Unni was buried there.

&quot;Vita Ansgari&quot; and &quot;Gesta&quot; are sometimes ambiguous, which has caused some controversy as to whether Birka and the Björkö settlement are the same location. Many other locations have been suggested through the years. However, Björkö is the only location that shows remains of a town of Birka&#x27;s significance, which is why the vast majority of scholars regard Björkö as the location of Birka.

Birka was abandoned during the latter half of the 10th century. Based on the dating of the coins, the city seems to have died out around 960. Roughly around the same time, the nearby settlement of Sigtuna supplanted Birka as the main trading center in the Mälaren area. The reasons for Birka&#x27;s decline are disputed. The Baltic island of Gotland was also in a better strategic position for Rus&#x27;-Byzantine trade and was gaining eminence as a mercantile stronghold. Historian Neil Kent has speculated that the area may have been the victim of an enemy assault.

The Varangian trade stations in Russia suffered a serious decline at roughly the same date.

===Rimbert&#x27;s description===
In &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot; (&quot;The life of Ansgar&quot;) monk and later archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen Rimbert gives the first known description of Birka. The town was the center of Catholic missionary activities in the 9th century Sweden. Rimbert&#x27;s interests were in the Christian faith, not so much in the Swedish geopolicy, so his descriptions of Birka remain approximate at best.

====Bridgehead of Christian missionaries====
This is how it all started in 829:

Meanwhile it happened that Swedish ambassadors had come to the Emperor Louis the Pious, and, amongst other matters which they had been ordered to bring to the attention of the emperor, they informed him that there were many belonging to their nation who desired to embrace the Christian religion, and that their king so far favoured this suggestion that he would permit God&#x27;s priests to reside there, provided that they might be deemed worthy of such a favour and that the emperor would send them suitable preachers. (Chapter IX)

Ansgar then undertook the mission committed to him by the emperor, who desired that he should go to the Swedes and discover whether this people was prepared to accept the faith as their messengers had declared. (Chapter X)

Ansgar was already experienced in the missionary work in Denmark, and set forth to Sweden. Rimbert describes the trip very generally:

It may suffice for me to say that while they were in the midst of their journey they fell into the hands of pirates. The merchants with whom they were travelling, defended themselves vigorously and for a time successfully, but eventually they were conquered and overcome by the pirates, who took from them their ships and all that they possessed, whilst they themselves barely escaped on. foot to land. —With great difficulty they accomplished their long journey on foot, traversing also the intervening seas (maria), where it was possible, by ship, and eventually arrived at the Swedish port called Birka. (Chapters X and XI)

Rimbert does not say where Ansgar sailed off or where he landed. Noteworthy is just his note about several &quot;seas&quot; that they had to cross to get to Birka from the place they had landed to. Since Rimbert mentions them to have crossed the seas by ship &quot;where it was possible&quot; they clearly had the alternative of going around them as well, meaning that the seas were probably the numerous lakes in southern Sweden. When Ansgar again travelled to Birka from Germany about 852, it went easier:

Ansgar accomplished the journey on which he had set out, and after spending nearly twenty days in a ship, he arrived at Birka (Chapter XXVI)

This might mean that he sailed off from Hamburg or Bremen instead of some port in Baltic Sea, since the later account by Adam of Bremen gives the distance of Scania and Birka to be only five days at sea.

====Kings====
Several Swedish kings of the 9th century, Björn, Anund and Olof, are all mentioned in &quot;Vita&quot; to have spent time in Birka. None of them is however said to have had his residence there, as the Swedish king and his retinue periodically moved between the Husbys, parts of the network of royal estates called Uppsala öd.

King Björn met Ansgar in Birka when he arrived there in 829 (Chapter XI). Later King Olof met him there as well during his last trip in 852 (Chapter XXVI).

====Church====
Ansgar&#x27;s missionary work resulted in first churches to be built in Sweden. Talking about Herigar, the prefect of Birka:

A little later he built a church on his own ancestral property and served God with the utmost devotion. (Chapter XI)

Herigar&#x27;s church was not far from the place where tings were held:

On one occasion he himself was sitting in an assembly of people, a stage having been arranged for a council on an open plain. He then summoned his servants and told them to carry him to his church. (Chapter XIX)

Another church was also built in Sweden, however location is left open:

This Gautbert, who at his consecration received the honoured name of the apostle Simeon, went to Sweden, and was honourably received by the king and the people; and he began, amidst general goodwill and approval, to build a church there (Chapter XIV)

The exiled Swedish King Anund Uppsale confirms that either one of the churches was in Birka itself when he ponders if Birka should be plundered:

&quot;There are there,&quot; he said, &quot;many great and powerful gods, and in former time a church was built there, and there are many Christians there who worship Christ&quot; (Chapter XIX)

====Probable fortress====

Danes attacked Birka, accompanied with the deposed king Anund, which caused great distress in the town.

Being in great difficulty they fled to a neighbouring city (ad civitatem, quæ iuxta erat, confugerunt) and began to promise and offer to their gods—But inasmuch as the city was not strong and there were few to offer resistance, they sent messengers to the Danes and asked for friendship and alliance. —Hergeir, the faithful servant of the Lord, was angry with them and said, &quot;They will lead away your wives and sons as captives, they will burn our city (urbs) and town (vicus)&quot; and will destroy you with the sword (Chapter XIX)

As the neighbouring &quot;city&quot; is not mentioned in any other context than during the Danish attack as a place where people took refuge, it probably meant a nearby fortress. Eventually Danes left, sparing Birka from destruction.

====&quot;Ting&quot; assembly====
When Ansgar asked if King Olof would permit him to establish the Christian religion in the kingdom during his second visit in 852, the king said to him:

On this account I have not the power, nor do I dare, to approve the objects of your mission until I can consult our gods by the casting of lots and until I can enquire the will of the people in regard to this matter. Let your messenger attend with me the next assembly (Chapter XXVI)

When the day for the assembly which was held in the town of Birka drew near, in accordance with their national custom the king caused a proclamation to be made to the people by the voice of a herald, in order that they might be informed concerning the object of their mission. —The king then rose up from amongst the assembly and forthwith directed one of his own messengers to accompany the bishop&#x27;s messenger, and to tell him that the people were unanimously inclined to accept his proposal and at the same time to tell him that, whilst their action was entirely agreeable to him, he could not give his full consent until, in another assembly, which was to be held in another part of his kingdom, he could announce this resolution to the people who lived in that district. (Chapter XXVII)

Tings were huge open-air events, which required plenty of space. The more important ting that king Olof talked about was probably the &quot;Ting of all Swedes&quot;, which was held at the end of February in Uppsala, during the Disting. The king was obliged to obey the common decisions made at this ting, and the most powerful man at this assembly was not the king, but the lawspeaker of Tiundaland. Locally important tings were the Westrogothic &quot;Ting of all Geats&quot; in Skara and the Ostrogothic &quot;Lionga ting&quot; in the vicinity of today&#x27;s Linköping.

===Adam of Bremen&#x27;s description===
In &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church), Adam of Bremen mentions Birka many times, and the book is the main source of information on the city. After its initial release in 1075–6, &quot;Gesta&quot; was complemented with supplementary &quot;Scholias&quot; until the death of Adam in the 1080s. Birca is described as an existing city in the original version, but then as destroyed in &quot;Scholia 138&quot;.

One of Adam&#x27;s main sources had been the German bishop Adalvard the Younger of Sigtuna and later of Skara as hinted in &quot;Scholia 119&quot;. He was also very familiar with Rimbert&#x27;s work. Adam himself never visited Birka.

====Location and port====
Adam described Birka as a Geatish port town and had gathered many details about it.

Birka is the main Geatish town (oppidum Gothorum), situated in the middle of Sweden (Suevoniae), not far (non longe) from the temple called Uppsala (Ubsola) which the Swedes (Sueones) held in the highest esteem when it comes to the worship of the gods; here forms an inlet of the Baltic or the Barbaric Sea a port facing north which welcomes all the wild peoples all around this sea but which is risky for those who are careless or ignorant of such places ... they have therefore blocked this inlet of the troubled sea with hidden masses of rocks along more than 100 stadions (18 km). On this anchorage, being the best sheltered within the maritime region of Sweden (Suevoniae), all the ships belonging to Danes (Danorum) known as Norwegians (Nortmannorum) as well as to Slavs (Sclavorum), Sembrians (Semborum) and other Scythian (Scithiae) peoples use to convene every year for sundry necessary commerce. (I 62)

Turning from the northern parts to the mouth of the Baltic Sea we first meet the Norwegians (Nortmanni), then the Danish region of Skåne (Sconia) stands out, and beyond these live the Geats (Gothi) for a long stretch all the way to Birka. (IV 14)

Having described Västergötland and Skara, Adam writes:

Beyond it Östergötland (Ostrogothia) extends along the sea, that is called the Baltic Sea, all the way to Birka. (IV 23)

Noteworthy in the following statement is the usage of the term &quot;not far&quot; (non longe) which was also used to describe the distance between Birka and the Uppsala temple:

Furthermore we have been told that there are many more islands in that sea, one of which is called the Great Estland (Aestland) – And this island is told to be quite close to the Woman Land (terrae feminarum), which is not far (non longe) away from Birka of the Swedes. (IV 17)

Adam also had travel instructions from Skåne to Sigtuna:

From Skåne (Sconia) of the Danes one reaches Sigtuna (Sictonam) or Birka after five days at sea, for they are indeed alike. But by land from Skåne across the Geatish people (Gothorum populos) and cities Skara (Scaranem), Telgas and Birka, one reaches Sigtuna only after a full month. (IV 28)

&quot;Telgas&quot; is not mentioned anywhere else, and it remains as speculative as Birka. The most popular identification among many telge names in Sweden is Södertälje. &quot;Scholia 121&quot; of IV 20 tells also:

For those who sail from Skåne (Sconia) of the Danes to Birka, the journey takes five days, from Birka to Russia (Ruzziam) likewise five days at sea. (Scholia 121)

The following definition remains even more mysterious:

In pity of their errors, our archbishop ordained as their diocesan capital Birka, which is in the middle of Sweden (Sueoniae) facing Jumne (Iumnem), the capital of the Slavs, and equally distant from all the coasts of the surrounding sea. (IV 20)

Since it is physically impossible for any Swedish town to face Jumne, the latter being situated along River Oder, Adam&#x27;s statement is probably a misunderstanding. No place having a similar name to Birka is known to have situated on the opposite shore of Oder, so it may be possible that something similar to Jumne was located opposite to Birka.

====Bishop====
Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen that oversaw the missionary work in Scandinavia until 1103, had appointed bishops to Sweden at least from 1014 onwards, the first see being in Skara. Several bishops were appointed for Sweden in 1060s, one also for Birka.

For Sweden, six were consecrated: Adalvard the Elder (Adalwardum) and Acilinum, also Adalvard the Younger (Adalwardum) and Tadicum, and furthermore Simeon (Symeonem) and the monk John (Iohannem). (III 70)

&quot;Scholia 94&quot; appends this as follows:

Adalvard the Elder (Adalwardus senior) was to superintend both lands of the Geats (uterque praefectus est Gothiae), Adalvard the Younger Sigtuna (Sictunam) and Uppsala (Ubsalam), Simeon (Symon) the Sami people (Scritefingos), John (Iohannes) the islands of the Baltic Sea. (Scholia 94)

Furthermore, the following was said about John&#x27;s location after talking about Birka:

For this city he ordained, as the first among our people, the abbot Hiltin, whom he wanted to call John. (IV 20)

John seems to have been situated in Birka in order to prepare for the missionary work among the many heathen people that flooded to Birca from around the Baltic coasts. This was a logical continuation to Birka&#x27;s position as the first missionary town in Sweden. Noteworthy here is that the biggest islands in the Baltic Sea, Öland and Gotland, were part of the diocese of Linköping in the Middle Ages, covering also Östergötland and eastern Småland.

====Location of Unni&#x27;s tomb====
&quot;Scholia 122&quot; of IV 20 locates the tomb of Hamburg&#x27;s archbishop Unni in Birka:

There is the port of Saint Ansgar and the tomb of the holy Archbishop Unni, and a familiar haven, it is said, for the holy confessors of our diocese. (Scholia 122)

According to &quot;Gesta&quot;, Unni had died in 936 (I 64).

====Destruction====
After having consistently described Birka as an existing city, &quot;Scholia 138&quot; of IV 29 describes Birka&#x27;s sudden demise. Talking about Adalvard the Younger, the bishop of Sigtuna and later that of Skara, Adam or a later copyist has written:

During his journey he seized the opportunity to make a detour to Birka, which is now reduced to loneliness so that one can hardly find vestiges of the city; therefore impossible to come upon the tomb of the holy Archbishop Unni. (Scholia 138)

The remark does not make it clear if Adalvard found the city destroyed or if that had happened after his visit and the later remark was just to warn the future pilgrims not to go there anymore in vain. As Adalvard was back in Bremen already by 1069 and is mentioned as one of Adam&#x27;s sources of information, it would have been expected that word about Birka&#x27;s destruction had reached also Adam before he published his work half a decade later.

==Björkö archaeological site==
The exact location of Birka was also lost during the centuries, leading to speculation from Swedish historians. In 1450, the island of Björkö was first claimed to be Birka by the &quot;Chronicle of Sweden&quot; (&quot;Prosaiska krönikan&quot;).

In search of Birka, National Antiquarian Johan Hadorph was the first to attempt excavations on Björkö in the late 17th century.

In the late 19th century, Hjalmar Stolpe, an entomologist by education, arrived on Björkö to study fossilized insects found in amber on the island. Stolpe found very large amounts of amber, which is unusual since amber is not normally found in lake Mälaren. Stolpe speculated that the island may have been an important trading post, prompting him to conduct a series of archeological excavations between 1871 and 1895. The excavations soon indicated that a major settlement had been located on the island and eventually Stolpe spent two decades excavating the island. After Björkö came to be identified with ancient Birka, it has been assumed that the original name of Birka was simply &quot;Bierkø&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Bjärkö&quot;), an earlier form of &quot;Björkö&quot;.

A significant collection of textiles fragments were retrieved during excavations, mostly from chamber graves. Agnes Geijer published the most detailed analysis of this collection in 1938, although her study was based upon only around 5% of the 4800 textile fragments preserved from the site. The collection represents a usual variety of different types of textiles showing high quality textiles manufactured by different techniques like tabby and twill. Mostly made from wool and flax, the quality of the textiles studied by Geijer ranged from very coarse to fine fabrics with high thread counts that required complicated techniques to create. The variety of materials and techniques to make the tablet woven textiles led Geijer to theorize that some of the textiles were imported. Geijer also found remains of the three-end twill textile that has not been found anywhere else in Northern Europe. Geijer theorized that some of the fragments came from the East, possibly China, due the use of gold and silver wire as well as silk.

Ownership of Björkö is today mainly in private hands and is used for farming and management also benefits biodiversity.

The archaeological remains are located in the north part of Björkö and span an area of about 7 hectares (17 acres). The remains are both burial-sites and buildings, and in the south part of this area, there is also a hill fort called &quot;Borgen&quot; (&quot;The Fortress&quot;). The construction technique of the buildings is still unknown, but the main material was wood. An adjacent island holds the remains of Hovgården, an estate that housed the King&#x27;s retinue during visits.

Approximately 700 people lived at Birka when it was at its largest, and about 3,000 graves have been found. Its administrative center was supposedly located outside of the settlement itself, on the nearby island of Adelsö.

The most recent large excavation was undertaken between 1990 and 1995 in a region of dark earth, believed to be the site of the main settlement.

===Shipyard===

On 15 June 2022, it was announced that archaeologists from Stockholm University&#x27;s Archaeological Research Laboratory had found a Viking Age shipyard in Lake Mälaren. It was the first time a site like the shipyard had been found.

&quot;The site found consisted of a stone-lined depression in the Viking Age shore zone with a wooden boat slip at the bottom. The finds at the site consist of large quantities of both unused and used boat rivets, whetstones made from slate and woodworking tools.&quot;

=== &quot;Allah&quot; textile controversy ===
In 2017, Annika Larsson, a textile researcher, claimed in a press release by Uppsala University to have discovered a textile among the finds from Birka that bore the Arabic words &quot;Allah&quot; and &quot;Ali&quot;. She theorized that some of the Vikings could have been influenced by Islam, leading to widespread media coverage. Stephennie Mulder, a professor of Islamic art at the University of Texas at Austin, replied to Larsson&#x27;s findings in a Twitter thread. Based on the epigraphy, Mulder argued that the textile bore a simple geometric pattern and not Arabic writing because the dating of the textile was from the 10th century and the style of writing Larsson claimed was on the textile, square Kufic, is not seen until the 15th century. Larsson had also proposed extensions to the tablet weaving that expanded beyond the original drawing by Agnes Geijer in 1938. Textile specialist Carolyn Priest-Dorman argued that the expansions are impossible because the fragment has finished edges called selvages and the band would have shown cut weft threads if the fragment had been narrowed at some point. Larsson&#x27;s drawings were speculative and not based on evidence that an expansion existed. The backlash following these criticisms led the press release on the Uppsala University website to include a note that Larsson&#x27;s research was preliminary and a comment regarding the criticisms. In 2020, Larsson published an article reiterating her claim that the textile bore Arabic writing, without addressing these criticisms.

=== &quot;Allah&quot; ring controversy ===

A ring was found during the archeological excavations at Birka between 1872 and 1895, when archeologist Hjalmar Stolpe discovered it in a 9th-century Viking woman&#x27;s burial. It is made of high-quality silver alloy and is set with a pink-violet oval glass. The ring, preserved at the Swedish history museum, became known as the &quot;Allah ring&quot; because of the pseudo-Kufic inscription found on the ring&#x27;s glass that resembles the word Allah (Arabic: الله). While other rings were found at the Birka excavations, the &quot;Allah ring&quot; was the only one that had this type of inscription. The Arabic historical linguist Marijn van Putten argued that the inscription on the ring was an example of pseudo-Kufic and that it has no meaning in Arabic. Nevertheless, other analysts extrapolated that the pseudo-Kufic engraving was indeed Arabic and that this was sufficient evidence to directly link Vikings to Islamic civilization. In her Twitter thread on the &quot;Allah” textile, Stephennie Mulder drew on the work of van Putten to argue that like the textile, the ring had been similarly misunderstood. However, she acknowledged that the Arabic language—found on the ring and other objects from Birka—was appreciated by the Vikings as a sign of social status. The inscription could suggest that the ring&#x27;s owner might have been one of the Viking elites who were in contact with the Islamic world via trade or travel.

=== Dragonhead ===
The Birka dragonhead is a 45mm long decorative object made from a tin alloy. Sven Kalmring and Lena Holmquist maintain that the dragonhead was cast from a soapstone mold due to the presence of casting burs on the object and the fact that similar casting molds of dragons have been found in Birka. Stylistically similar dragonheads have been discovered around the Baltic, and scholars like Anne-Sofie Gräslund believe they likely functioned as dress pins.
=== Wearable accessories ===
10 small silver crosses were found in graves at Birka. Missionaries, brought by Rimbert and others, lead to some converts to Christianity. 27 graves contained small pendants of Thor&#x27;s hammer from around the 10th century. Both traditional Viking religious beliefs and Christianity were present at Birka.

Many Birka grave excavations produced a number of funerary findings unique to the deceased and the region of the grave. In the excavation of grave Bj 463, a small copper alloy brooch with animal motifs was found alongside the skeletal remains of a young girl from Birka, and similar ones appeared in other excavations around Birka.

The brooch is understood to be typically related to female burials and also female jewelry of the Viking period. The surrounding fragments of textiles attached to these brooches, scattered around various graves across Sweden, also give an understanding of what the typical womenswear of the Viking age may have been in the 9th and 10th centuries.

=== Dirham coins ===
Dirham coins have been located all around Scandinavian countries and suggest strong trade relations existed between the medieval Middle East and Northern Europe. A dirham coin was found in the excavation of grave sites in Birka, with Arabic writing and an absence of imagery that would date the coin sometime after the 7th century. Other writing on the coin indicates the location of the mint as well as the names of a caliph and an Amir, which place the coin&#x27;s origins in al-Shah, modern day Tashkent in Uzbekistan. The coin&#x27;s inscription in Arabic translates into English:There is no deity but Allah alone he has no equal For God Muhammad is the messenger of God.

== Birka burial sites ==

Over 3,000 grave sites are located in Birka, including both cremations and inhumations in coffins or chamber graves. Skeletal analysis and the presence of gender-specific jewelry and objects in graves has shown that the majority of the deceased are female. Scholar Nancy L. Wicker suggests that the disproportionate number of female graves is due to the fact that female grave goods are easily identifiable, but male graves without objects are difficult to identify.

Many graves contain objects such as coins, glass, and textiles that originated in foreign countries as far as the Middle East and Eastern Asia. According to Nancy L. Wicker, these objects were either imported to Birka as luxury trade goods, or they belonged to foreign individuals who were buried at Birka.

Grave Bj 463 contained the skeleton of a girl from the mid-10th century. She was buried in a coffin with grave goods associated with high-status women, including a round brooch, glass beads, and a needle case. By the condition of her teeth, she was 5–6 years old at the time of her death, and further analysis determined that her diet was similar to that of male warriors instead of a typical child&#x27;s diet. Scholar Marianne Hem Eriksen maintains that this girl is an unusual case of a high-status child burial, as children were seldom buried with identifiable grave goods.
