<text>In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making formula_1 comparisons, where formula_2 is the number of elements in the array. Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables, that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.

There are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in computational geometry and in numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.

== Algorithm ==
Binary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration.

=== Procedure ===
Given an array formula_3 of formula_2 elements with values or records formula_5sorted such that formula_6, and target value formula_7, the following subroutine uses binary search to find the index of formula_7 in formula_3.
# Set formula_10 to formula_11 and formula_12 to formula_13.
# If formula_14, the search terminates as unsuccessful.
# Set formula_15 (the position of the middle element) to the floor of formula_16, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to formula_16.
# If formula_18, set formula_10 to formula_20 and go to step 2.
# If formula_21, set formula_12 to formula_23 and go to step 2.
# Now formula_24, the search is done; return formula_15.

This iterative procedure keeps track of the search boundaries with the two variables formula_10 and formula_12. The procedure may be expressed in pseudocode as follows, where the variable names and types remain the same as above, codice_1 is the floor function, and codice_2 refers to a specific value that conveys the failure of the search.

 function binary_search(A, n, T) is
 L := 0
 R := n − 1
 while L ≤ R do
 m := floor((L + R) / 2)
 if A[m] &lt; T then
 L := m + 1
 else if A[m] &gt; T then
 R := m − 1
 else:
 return m
 return unsuccessful

Alternatively, the algorithm may take the ceiling of formula_16. This may change the result if the target value appears more than once in the array.

==== Alternative procedure ====
In the above procedure, the algorithm checks whether the middle element (formula_15) is equal to the target (formula_7) in every iteration. Some implementations leave out this check during each iteration. The algorithm would perform this check only when one element is left (when formula_31). This results in a faster comparison loop, as one comparison is eliminated per iteration, while it requires only one more iteration on average.

Hermann Bottenbruch published the first implementation to leave out this check in 1962.

# Set formula_10 to formula_11 and formula_12 to formula_13.
# While formula_36,
## Set formula_15 (the position of the middle element) to the ceiling of formula_16, which is the least integer greater than or equal to formula_16.
## If formula_21, set formula_12 to formula_23.
## Else, formula_43; set formula_10 to formula_15.
# Now formula_31, the search is done. If formula_47, return formula_10. Otherwise, the search terminates as unsuccessful.

Where codice_3 is the ceiling function, the pseudocode for this version is:

 function binary_search_alternative(A, n, T) is
 L := 0
 R := n − 1
 while L != R do
 m := ceil((L + R) / 2)
 if A[m] &gt; T then
 R := m − 1
 else:
 L := m
 if A[L] = T then
 return L
 return unsuccessful

=== Duplicate elements ===
The procedure may return any index whose element is equal to the target value, even if there are duplicate elements in the array. For example, if the array to be searched was formula_49 and the target was formula_50, then it would be correct for the algorithm to either return the 4th (index 3) or 5th (index 4) element. The regular procedure would return the 4th element (index 3) in this case. It does not always return the first duplicate (consider formula_51 which still returns the 4th element). However, it is sometimes necessary to find the leftmost element or the rightmost element for a target value that is duplicated in the array. In the above example, the 4th element is the leftmost element of the value 4, while the 5th element is the rightmost element of the value 4. The alternative procedure above will always return the index of the rightmost element if such an element exists.

==== Procedure for finding the leftmost element ====
To find the leftmost element, the following procedure can be used:

# Set formula_10 to formula_11 and formula_12 to formula_2.
# While formula_56,
## Set formula_15 (the position of the middle element) to the floor of formula_16, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to formula_16.
## If formula_18, set formula_10 to formula_20.
## Else, formula_63; set &quot;formula_12&quot; to formula_15.
# Return formula_10.

If formula_67 and formula_68, then formula_69 is the leftmost element that equals formula_7. Even if formula_7 is not in the array, formula_10 is the rank of formula_7 in the array, or the number of elements in the array that are less than formula_7.

Where codice_1 is the floor function, the pseudocode for this version is:

 function binary_search_leftmost(A, n, T):
 L := 0
 R := n
 while L &lt; R:
 m := floor((L + R) / 2)
 if A[m] &lt; T:
 L := m + 1
 else:
 R := m
 return L

==== Procedure for finding the rightmost element ====
To find the rightmost element, the following procedure can be used:

# Set formula_10 to formula_11 and formula_12 to formula_2.
# While formula_56,
## Set formula_15 (the position of the middle element) to the floor of formula_16, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to formula_16.
## If formula_21, set formula_12 to formula_15.
## Else, formula_43; set &quot;formula_10&quot; to formula_20.
# Return formula_89.

If formula_90 and formula_91, then formula_92 is the rightmost element that equals formula_7. Even if &quot;formula_7&quot; is not in the array, formula_95 is the number of elements in the array that are greater than &quot;formula_7&quot;.

Where codice_1 is the floor function, the pseudocode for this version is:

 function binary_search_rightmost(A, n, T):
 L := 0
 R := n
 while L &lt; R:
 m := floor((L + R) / 2)
 if A[m] &gt; T:
 R := m
 else:
 L := m + 1
 return R - 1

=== Approximate matches ===

The above procedure only performs &quot;exact&quot; matches, finding the position of a target value. However, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches because binary search operates on sorted arrays. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.
* Rank queries can be performed with the procedure for finding the leftmost element. The number of elements &quot;less than&quot; the target value is returned by the procedure.
* Predecessor queries can be performed with rank queries. If the rank of the target value is formula_97, its predecessor is formula_98.
* For successor queries, the procedure for finding the rightmost element can be used. If the result of running the procedure for the target value is &quot;formula_97&quot;, then the successor of the target value is formula_100.
* The nearest neighbor of the target value is either its predecessor or successor, whichever is closer.
* Range queries are also straightforward. Once the ranks of the two values are known, the number of elements greater than or equal to the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether the array contains entries matching those endpoints.

== Performance ==

In terms of the number of comparisons, the performance of binary search can be analyzed by viewing the run of the procedure on a binary tree. The root node of the tree is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root, and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. Starting from the root node, the left or right subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration.

In the worst case, binary search makes formula_101 iterations of the comparison loop, where the formula_102 notation denotes the floor function that yields the greatest integer less than or equal to the argument, and formula_103 is the binary logarithm. This is because the worst case is reached when the search reaches the deepest level of the tree, and there are always formula_101 levels in the tree for any binary search.

The worst case may also be reached when the target element is not in the array. If formula_105 is one less than a power of two, then this is always the case. Otherwise, the search may perform formula_101iterations if the search reaches the deepest level of the tree. However, it may make formula_107 iterations, which is one less than the worst case, if the search ends at the second-deepest level of the tree.

On average, assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, binary search makes formula_108 iterations when the target element is in the array. This is approximately equal to formula_109 iterations. When the target element is not in the array, binary search makes formula_110 iterations on average, assuming that the range between and outside elements is equally likely to be searched.

In the best case, where the target value is the middle element of the array, its position is returned after one iteration.

In terms of iterations, no search algorithm that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst-case performance than binary search. The comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as every level above the lowest level of the tree is filled completely. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, increasing the number of iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over &quot;all&quot; elements is worse than binary search. By dividing the array in half, binary search ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.

=== Space complexity ===
Binary search requires three pointers to elements, which may be array indices or pointers to memory locations, regardless of the size of the array. Therefore, the space complexity of binary search is formula_111 in the word RAM model of computation.

=== Derivation of average case ===
The average number of iterations performed by binary search depends on the probability of each element being searched. The average case is different for successful searches and unsuccessful searches. It will be assumed that each element is equally likely to be searched for successful searches. For unsuccessful searches, it will be assumed that the intervals between and outside elements are equally likely to be searched. The average case for successful searches is the number of iterations required to search every element exactly once, divided by formula_2, the number of elements. The average case for unsuccessful searches is the number of iterations required to search an element within every interval exactly once, divided by the formula_113 intervals.

==== Successful searches ====

In the binary tree representation, a successful search can be represented by a path from the root to the target node, called an &quot;internal path&quot;. The length of a path is the number of edges (connections between nodes) that the path passes through. The number of iterations performed by a search, given that the corresponding path has length , is formula_114 counting the initial iteration. The &quot;internal path length&quot; is the sum of the lengths of all unique internal paths. Since there is only one path from the root to any single node, each internal path represents a search for a specific element. If there are elements, which is a positive integer, and the internal path length is formula_115, then the average number of iterations for a successful search formula_116, with the one iteration added to count the initial iteration.

Since binary search is the optimal algorithm for searching with comparisons, this problem is reduced to calculating the minimum internal path length of all binary trees with nodes, which is equal to:

formula_117

For example, in a 7-element array, the root requires one iteration, the two elements below the root require two iterations, and the four elements below require three iterations. In this case, the internal path length is:

formula_118

The average number of iterations would be formula_119 based on the equation for the average case. The sum for formula_115 can be simplified to:

formula_121

Substituting the equation for formula_115 into the equation for formula_123:

formula_124

For integer , this is equivalent to the equation for the average case on a successful search specified above.

==== Unsuccessful searches ====
Unsuccessful searches can be represented by augmenting the tree with &quot;external nodes&quot;, which forms an &quot;extended binary tree&quot;. If an internal node, or a node present in the tree, has fewer than two child nodes, then additional child nodes, called external nodes, are added so that each internal node has two children. By doing so, an unsuccessful search can be represented as a path to an external node, whose parent is the single element that remains during the last iteration. An &quot;external path&quot; is a path from the root to an external node. The &quot;external path length&quot; is the sum of the lengths of all unique external paths. If there are formula_2 elements, which is a positive integer, and the external path length is formula_126, then the average number of iterations for an unsuccessful search formula_127, with the one iteration added to count the initial iteration. The external path length is divided by formula_128 instead of formula_2 because there are formula_128 external paths, representing the intervals between and outside the elements of the array.

This problem can similarly be reduced to determining the minimum external path length of all binary trees with formula_2 nodes. For all binary trees, the external path length is equal to the internal path length plus formula_132. Substituting the equation for formula_115:

formula_134

Substituting the equation for formula_126 into the equation for formula_136, the average case for unsuccessful searches can be determined:

formula_137

==== Performance of alternative procedure ====
Each iteration of the binary search procedure defined above makes one or two comparisons, checking if the middle element is equal to the target in each iteration. Assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, each iteration makes 1.5 comparisons on average. A variation of the algorithm checks whether the middle element is equal to the target at the end of the search. On average, this eliminates half a comparison from each iteration. This slightly cuts the time taken per iteration on most computers. However, it guarantees that the search takes the maximum number of iterations, on average adding one iteration to the search. Because the comparison loop is performed only formula_101 times in the worst case, the slight increase in efficiency per iteration does not compensate for the extra iteration for all but very large formula_105.

=== Running time and cache use ===
In analyzing the performance of binary search, another consideration is the time required to compare two elements. For integers and strings, the time required increases linearly as the encoding length (usually the number of bits) of the elements increase. For example, comparing a pair of 64-bit unsigned integers would require comparing up to double the bits as comparing a pair of 32-bit unsigned integers. The worst case is achieved when the integers are equal. This can be significant when the encoding lengths of the elements are large, such as with large integer types or long strings, which makes comparing elements expensive. Furthermore, comparing floating-point values (the most common digital representation of real numbers) is often more expensive than comparing integers or short strings.

On most computer architectures, the processor has a hardware cache separate from RAM. Since they are located within the processor itself, caches are much faster to access but usually store much less data than RAM. Therefore, most processors store memory locations that have been accessed recently, along with memory locations close to it. For example, when an array element is accessed, the element itself may be stored along with the elements that are stored close to it in RAM, making it faster to sequentially access array elements that are close in index to each other (locality of reference). On a sorted array, binary search can jump to distant memory locations if the array is large, unlike algorithms (such as linear search and linear probing in hash tables) which access elements in sequence. This adds slightly to the running time of binary search for large arrays on most systems.

== Binary search versus other schemes ==
Sorted arrays with binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval, taking formula_140 time for each such operation. In addition, sorted arrays can complicate memory use especially when elements are often inserted into the array. There are other data structures that support much more efficient insertion and deletion. Binary search can be used to perform exact matching and set membership (determining whether a target value is in a collection of values). There are data structures that support faster exact matching and set membership. However, unlike many other searching schemes, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching, usually performing such matches in formula_141 time regardless of the type or structure of the values themselves. In addition, there are some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, that can be performed efficiently on a sorted array.

=== Linear search ===
Linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short, although the array needs to be sorted beforehand. All sorting algorithms based on comparing elements, such as quicksort and merge sort, require at least formula_142 comparisons in the worst case. Unlike linear search, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching. There are operations such as finding the smallest and largest element that can be done efficiently on a sorted array but not on an unsorted array.

=== Trees ===
A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure that works based on the principle of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary search trees. This can be faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.

However, binary search is usually more efficient for searching as binary search trees will most likely be imperfectly balanced, resulting in slightly worse performance than binary search. This even applies to balanced binary search trees, binary search trees that balance their own nodes, because they rarely produce the tree with the fewest possible levels. Except for balanced binary search trees, the tree may be severely imbalanced with few internal nodes with two children, resulting in the average and worst-case search time approaching formula_105 comparisons. Binary search trees take more space than sorted arrays.

Binary search trees lend themselves to fast searching in external memory stored in hard disks, as binary search trees can be efficiently structured in filesystems. The B-tree generalizes this method of tree organization. B-trees are frequently used to organize long-term storage such as databases and filesystems.

=== Hashing ===
For implementing associative arrays, hash tables, a data structure that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records. Most hash table implementations require only amortized constant time on average. However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, as the only information given on a failed search is that the target is not present in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. Binary search also supports approximate matches. Some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, can be done efficiently on sorted arrays but not on hash tables.

=== Set membership algorithms ===
A related problem to search is set membership. Any algorithm that does lookup, like binary search, can also be used for set membership. There are other algorithms that are more specifically suited for set membership. A bit array is the simplest, useful when the range of keys is limited. It compactly stores a collection of bits, with each bit representing a single key within the range of keys. Bit arrays are very fast, requiring only formula_144 time. The Judy1 type of Judy array handles 64-bit keys efficiently.

For approximate results, Bloom filters, another probabilistic data structure based on hashing, store a set of keys by encoding the keys using a bit array and multiple hash functions. Bloom filters are much more space-efficient than bit arrays in most cases and not much slower: with formula_145 hash functions, membership queries require only formula_146 time. However, Bloom filters suffer from false positives.

=== Other data structures ===
There exist data structures that may improve on binary search in some cases for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.

== Variations ==

=== Uniform binary search ===
Uniform binary search stores, instead of the lower and upper bounds, the difference in the index of the middle element from the current iteration to the next iteration. A lookup table containing the differences is computed beforehand. For example, if the array to be searched is , the middle element (formula_15) would be . In this case, the middle element of the left subarray () is and the middle element of the right subarray () is . Uniform binary search would store the value of as both indices differ from by this same amount. To reduce the search space, the algorithm either adds or subtracts this change from the index of the middle element. Uniform binary search may be faster on systems where it is inefficient to calculate the midpoint, such as on decimal computers.

=== Exponential search ===
Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. It starts by finding the first element with an index that is both a power of two and greater than the target value. Afterwards, it sets that index as the upper bound, and switches to binary search. A search takes formula_148 iterations before binary search is started and at most formula_149 iterations of the binary search, where formula_150 is the position of the target value. Exponential search works on bounded lists, but becomes an improvement over binary search only if the target value lies near the beginning of the array.

=== Interpolation search ===
Instead of calculating the midpoint, interpolation search estimates the position of the target value, taking into account the lowest and highest elements in the array as well as length of the array. It works on the basis that the midpoint is not the best guess in many cases. For example, if the target value is close to the highest element in the array, it is likely to be located near the end of the array.

A common interpolation function is linear interpolation. If formula_3 is the array, formula_152 are the lower and upper bounds respectively, and formula_7 is the target, then the target is estimated to be about formula_154 of the way between formula_10 and formula_12. When linear interpolation is used, and the distribution of the array elements is uniform or near uniform, interpolation search makes formula_157 comparisons.

In practice, interpolation search is slower than binary search for small arrays, as interpolation search requires extra computation. Its time complexity grows more slowly than binary search, but this only compensates for the extra computation for large arrays.

=== Fractional cascading ===
Fractional cascading is a technique that speeds up binary searches for the same element in multiple sorted arrays. Searching each array separately requires formula_158 time, where formula_145 is the number of arrays. Fractional cascading reduces this to formula_160 by storing specific information in each array about each element and its position in the other arrays.

Fractional cascading was originally developed to efficiently solve various computational geometry problems. Fractional cascading has been applied elsewhere, such as in data mining and Internet Protocol routing.

=== Generalization to graphs ===
Binary search has been generalized to work on certain types of graphs, where the target value is stored in a vertex instead of an array element. Binary search trees are one such generalization—when a vertex (node) in the tree is queried, the algorithm either learns that the vertex is the target, or otherwise which subtree the target would be located in. However, this can be further generalized as follows: given an undirected, positively weighted graph and a target vertex, the algorithm learns upon querying a vertex that it is equal to the target, or it is given an incident edge that is on the shortest path from the queried vertex to the target. The standard binary search algorithm is simply the case where the graph is a path. Similarly, binary search trees are the case where the edges to the left or right subtrees are given when the queried vertex is unequal to the target. For all undirected, positively weighted graphs, there is an algorithm that finds the target vertex in formula_1 queries in the worst case.

=== Noisy binary search ===

Noisy binary search algorithms solve the case where the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array. For each pair of elements, there is a certain probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. Every noisy binary search procedure must make at least formula_162 comparisons on average, where formula_163 is the binary entropy function and formula_164 is the probability that the procedure yields the wrong position. The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, a variant of Twenty Questions where the answers may be wrong.

=== Quantum binary search ===
Classical computers are bounded to the worst case of exactly formula_165 iterations when performing binary search. Quantum algorithms for binary search are still bounded to a proportion of formula_166 queries (representing iterations of the classical procedure), but the constant factor is less than one, providing for a lower time complexity on quantum computers. Any &quot;exact&quot; quantum binary search procedure—that is, a procedure that always yields the correct result—requires at least formula_167 queries in the worst case, where formula_168 is the natural logarithm. There is an exact quantum binary search procedure that runs in formula_169 queries in the worst case. In comparison, Grover&#x27;s algorithm is the optimal quantum algorithm for searching an unordered list of elements, and it requires formula_170 queries.

== History ==
The idea of sorting a list of items to allow for faster searching dates back to antiquity. The earliest known example was the Inakibit-Anu tablet from Babylon dating back to . The tablet contained about 500 sexagesimal numbers and their reciprocals sorted in lexicographical order, which made searching for a specific entry easier. In addition, several lists of names that were sorted by their first letter were discovered on the Aegean Islands. &quot;Catholicon&quot;, a Latin dictionary finished in 1286 CE, was the first work to describe rules for sorting words into alphabetical order, as opposed to just the first few letters.

In 1946, John Mauchly made the first mention of binary search as part of the Moore School Lectures, a seminal and foundational college course in computing. In 1957, William Wesley Peterson published the first method for interpolation search. Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when Derrick Henry Lehmer published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an ALGOL 60 implementation of binary search that placed the comparison for equality at the end, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The uniform binary search was developed by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University in 1971. In 1986, Bernard Chazelle and Leonidas J. Guibas introduced fractional cascading as a method to solve numerous search problems in computational geometry.

== Implementation issues ==
When Jon Bentley assigned binary search as a problem in a course for professional programmers, he found that ninety percent failed to provide a correct solution after several hours of working on it, mainly because the incorrect implementations failed to run or returned a wrong answer in rare edge cases. A study published in 1988 shows that accurate code for it is only found in five out of twenty textbooks. Furthermore, Bentley&#x27;s own implementation of binary search, published in his 1986 book &quot;Programming Pearls&quot;, contained an overflow error that remained undetected for over twenty years. The Java programming language library implementation of binary search had the same overflow bug for more than nine years.

In a practical implementation, the variables used to represent the indices will often be of fixed size (integers), and this can result in an arithmetic overflow for very large arrays. If the midpoint of the span is calculated as formula_16, then the value of formula_172 may exceed the range of integers of the data type used to store the midpoint, even if formula_10 and formula_12 are within the range. If &quot;formula_10&quot; and &quot;formula_12&quot; are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint as formula_177.

An infinite loop may occur if the exit conditions for the loop are not defined correctly. Once &quot;formula_10&quot; exceeds &quot;formula_12&quot;, the search has failed and must convey the failure of the search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, or in the case of an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that most of the programmers who incorrectly implemented binary search made an error in defining the exit conditions.

== Library support ==
Many languages&#x27; standard libraries include binary search routines:

* C provides the function codice_6 in its standard library, which is typically implemented via binary search, although the official standard does not require it so.
* C++&#x27;s standard library provides the functions codice_7, codice_8, codice_9 and codice_10.
* D&#x27;s standard library Phobos, in codice_11 module provides a type codice_12 (returned by codice_13 and codice_14 functions) with methods codice_15, codice_16, codice_17 and codice_18, that use binary search techniques by default for ranges that offer random access.
* COBOL provides the codice_19 verb for performing binary searches on COBOL ordered tables.
* Go&#x27;s codice_20 standard library package contains the functions codice_21, codice_22, codice_23, and codice_24, which implement general binary search, as well as specific implementations for searching slices of integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, respectively.
* Java offers a set of overloaded codice_25 static methods in the classes and in the standard codice_26 package for performing binary searches on Java arrays and on codice_27s, respectively.
* Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Framework 2.0 offers static generic versions of the binary search algorithm in its collection base classes. An example would be codice_28&#x27;s method codice_29.
* For Objective-C, the Cocoa framework provides the method in Mac OS X 10.6+. Apple&#x27;s Core Foundation C framework also contains a codice_30 function.
* Python provides the codice_31 module that keeps a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion.
* Ruby&#x27;s Array class includes a codice_32 method with built-in approximate matching.
* Rust&#x27;s slice primitive provides codice_7, codice_34, codice_35, and codice_36.

<text>Belle and Sebastian are a Scottish indie pop band formed in Glasgow in 1996. Led by Stuart Murdoch, the band has released twelve studio albums. They are often compared with acts such as the Smiths and Nick Drake. The band took their name from the 1965 television series &quot;Belle and Sebastian&quot;. Though consistently lauded by critics, Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s &quot;wistful pop&quot; has enjoyed only limited commercial success.

==History==
===Formation, early years and &quot;Tigermilk&quot; (1994–1996)===
In 1994, Stuart Murdoch and Stuart David both enrolled at Stow College&#x27;s Beatbox programme for unemployed musicians in Glasgow. Together, with music professor Alan Rankine (formerly of the Associates), they recorded some demos, which in 1996 were picked up by the college&#x27;s Music Business course that produces and releases one single each year on the college&#x27;s label, Electric Honey. As Murdoch had a number of songs already and the label was extremely impressed with the demos, he was granted permission to record a full-length album, which was recorded mostly live over three days, entitled &quot;Tigermilk&quot;.

Murdoch and David recruited local musicians Stevie Jackson (guitar and vocals), Isobel Campbell (cello/vocals), Chris Geddes (keys) and Richard Colburn (drums), the latter of whom shared a flat with David and was a student on the Music Business course, to perform on the album, with Murdoch describing the process as a &quot;product of botched capitalism&quot;. The band chose the name Belle and Sebastian from a short story Murdoch had written inspired by the television series of the same name, about a six-year-old boy and his dog, named Belle, a Great Pyrenees. In June 1996, Electric Honey pressed up one thousand copies of &quot;Tigermilk&quot; on vinyl.

===&quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot; and early EPs (1996–1998)===
The warm response &quot;Tigermilk&quot; received led to the band being signed to Jeepster Records in August 1996, who released their second album &quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot; on 18 November. The album was named by &quot;Spin&quot; as one of the 100 greatest albums between 1985 and 2005, and it is widely considered the band&#x27;s masterpiece. Just before the recording of &quot;Sinister&quot;, Sarah Martin (violin/vocals) joined the band.

Following this a series of EPs were released throughout 1997. The first of these was &quot;Dog on Wheels&quot;, released in May and consisting of four demo tracks recorded prior to the real formation of the band. In fact, the only long-term band members to play on the songs were Murdoch, David, and Mick Cooke, who played trumpet on the EP but would not officially join the band until a few years later. It charted at No. 59 in the UK singles chart. The &quot;Lazy Line Painter Jane&quot; EP followed in July. The track was recorded in the church where Murdoch lived and features vocals from Monica Queen. The EP narrowly missed out on the UK top 40, peaking at No. 41. The last of the EPs was October&#x27;s &quot;3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light&quot;. The EP was made Single of the Week in both the &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and reached No. 32 in the charts, thus becoming the band&#x27;s first top 40 single.

Despite the band&#x27;s growing popularity, during this period they kept a low profile at the insistence of Murdoch, who was still regaining his strength following years struggling with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The band played gigs sporadically, rarely gave interviews, and refused to appear in publicity photographs, often getting friends and acquaintances to pose instead. The relative reclusiveness helped to create an aura of mystique around them.

===&quot;The Boy with the Arab Strap&quot;, &quot;Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant&quot; and Line-up Changes (1998–2003)===

The band released their third LP, &quot;The Boy with the Arab Strap&quot; in 1998, and it reached No. 12 in the UK charts. &quot;Arab Strap&quot; garnered an NPR interview and positive reviews from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice,&quot; and others; however, the album has its detractors, including &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, who gave the album a particularly poor review, calling it a &quot;parody&quot; of their earlier work (Pitchfork has since removed the review from their website and re-reviewed the album positively in 2018). During the recording of the album, long-time studio trumpet-player Mick Cooke was asked to join the band as a full member. The &quot;This Is Just a Modern Rock Song&quot; EP followed later that year.

In 1999, the band was awarded with Best Newcomer (for their third album) at the BRIT Awards, upsetting better-known acts such as Steps and 5ive. That same year, the band hosted their own festival, the Bowlie Weekender. &quot;Tigermilk&quot; was also given a full release by Jeepster before the band started work on their next LP. The result was &quot;Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first top 10 album in the UK, though critics felt that the band were starting to stagnate. A stand-alone single, &quot;Legal Man&quot;, reached No. 15 and gave them their first appearance on Top of the Pops.

As the band&#x27;s popularity and recognition was growing worldwide, their music began appearing in films and on television. The 2000 film &quot;High Fidelity&quot; mentions the band (with Jack Black&#x27;s character referring to them as &quot;old sad bastard music&quot; and disdaining their soft style) and features a clip from the song &quot;Seymour Stein&quot; from &quot;The Boy with the Arab Strap&quot;. Two songs by the band (&quot;Expectations&quot; and &quot;Piazza, New York Catcher&quot;) appeared on the soundtrack for the 2007 hit film &quot;Juno.&quot; Also, the title track from &quot;Arab Strap&quot; was played over the end credits of the UK television series &quot;Teachers,&quot; and the lyric &quot;Colour my life with the chaos of trouble&quot; from the song was quoted by one of the characters in the 2009 film &quot;(500) Days of Summer&quot;.

Stuart David soon left the band to concentrate on his side project, Looper, and his book writing, which included his &quot;The Idle Thoughts of a Daydreamer&quot;. He was replaced by Bobby Kildea of V-Twin. The &quot;Jonathan David&quot; single, sung by Stevie Jackson, was released in June 2001 and was followed by &quot;I&#x27;m Waking Up to Us&quot; in November, which saw the band use an outside producer (Mike Hurst) for the first time. Most of 2002 was spent touring and recording a soundtrack album, &quot;Storytelling&quot; (for &quot;Storytelling&quot; by Todd Solondz). Campbell left the band in the spring of 2002, in the middle of the band&#x27;s North American tour to pursue a solo career, first as The Gentle Waves, and later under her own name. She later collaborated with singer Mark Lanegan on three albums.

===&quot;Dear Catastrophe Waitress&quot;, &quot;The Life Pursuit&quot; and hiatus (2003–2010)===
The band left Jeepster in 2002, signing a four-album deal with Rough Trade Records. Their first album for Rough Trade, &quot;Dear Catastrophe Waitress&quot;, was released in 2003 and was produced by Trevor Horn. The album showed a markedly more &quot;produced&quot; sound compared to their first four LPs, as the band was making a concerted effort to produce more &quot;radio-friendly&quot; music. At this point, the band began to engage more with the press and started appearing in publicity shots. The album was warmly received and is credited with restoring the band&#x27;s &quot;indie cred&quot;. The album also marked the return of Murdoch as the group&#x27;s primary songwriter, following the poorly received &quot;Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant&quot; and &quot;Storytelling&quot;, both of which were more collaborative than the band&#x27;s early work. A documentary DVD, &quot;Fans Only&quot;, was released by Jeepster in October 2003, featuring promotional videos, live clips and unreleased footage. A single from the album, &quot;Step into My Office, Baby&quot; followed in November 2003; it would be their first single to be taken from an album, and included a track recorded with Divine Comedy producer Darren Allison entitled &quot;Love on the March&quot;.

The Thin Lizzy-inspired &quot;I&#x27;m a Cuckoo&quot; was the second single from the album. It achieved their highest chart position yet, reaching No. 14 in the UK. The &quot;Books&quot; EP followed, a double A-side single led by &quot;Wrapped Up in Books&quot; from &quot;Dear Catastrophe Waitress&quot; and the new &quot;Your Cover&#x27;s Blown&quot;. This EP became the band&#x27;s third top 20 UK release, and the band was nominated for both the Mercury Music Prize and an Ivor Novello Award. In January 2005, B&amp;S was voted Scotland&#x27;s greatest band in a poll by The List, beating Simple Minds, Idlewild, Travis, Franz Ferdinand, and The Proclaimers, among others.

In April 2005, members of the band visited Israel and the Palestinian territories with the UK charity War on Want; the group subsequently recorded a song inspired by the trip titled &quot;The Eighth Station of the Cross Kebab House&quot;, which would first appear on the digital-download version of the charity album Help!: A Day in the Life and would later have a physical release as a B-side on 2006&#x27;s &quot;Funny Little Frog&quot; single. &quot;Push Barman to Open Old Wounds&quot;, a compilation of the Jeepster singles and EPs, was released in May 2005 while the band were recording their seventh album in California. The result of the sessions was &quot;The Life Pursuit&quot;, produced by Tony Hoffer. The album, originally intended to be a double album, became the band&#x27;s highest-charting album upon its release in February 2006, peaking at No. 8 in the UK and No. 65 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Funny Little Frog&quot;, which preceded it, also proved to be their highest-charting single, debuting at No. 13.

On 6 July 2006, the band played a historic show with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. The opening act at the 18,000 seat sell-out concert was The Shins. The members of the band see this as a landmark event, with Stevie Jackson saying, &quot;This is the biggest thrill of my entire life&quot;. In October 2006, members of the band helped put together a CD collection of new songs for children titled &quot;Colours Are Brighter&quot;, with the involvement of major bands such as Franz Ferdinand and The Flaming Lips.

On 18 November 2008 the band released &quot;The BBC Sessions&quot;, which features songs from the period of 1996–2001 (including the last recordings featuring Isobel Campbell before she left the band), along with a second disc featuring a recording of a live performance in Belfast from Christmas 2001.

===&quot;Write About Love&quot; and &quot;Girls In Peacetime Want to Dance&quot; (2010–2016)===
On 17 July 2010, the band performed their first UK gig in almost four years to a crowd of around 30,000 at Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Southwold. They performed two new songs, &quot;I Didn&#x27;t See It Coming&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Living in the Real World&quot;.

Their eighth studio album, released in the UK and internationally on 25 September 2010, was titled &quot;Write about Love&quot;. The first single from the album, as well as the record&#x27;s title track &quot;Write about Love&quot;, was released in the US on 7 September 2010. &quot;Write about Love&quot; entered the UK albums chart in its first week of release, peaking at No. 8 as of 19 October 2010. Norah Jones is featured on the track &quot;Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John&quot;, and Carey Mulligan sings on the title track.

In December 2010 Belle and Sebastian curated the sequel to the &quot;Bowlie Weekender&quot; in the form of &quot;Bowlie 2&quot; presented by All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties.

In 2013, Pitchfork TV released an hour-long documentary in February, directed by RJ Bentler which focused on the band&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot;, as well as the formation and early releases of the band. The documentary featured interviews with every member that was present on the album, as well as several archival photos and videos from the band&#x27;s early days. The band compiled a second compilation album &quot;The Third Eye Centre&quot; which included the B-sides and rarities released after &quot;Push Barman to Open Old Wounds&quot;, from the albums &quot;Dear Catastrophe Waitress&quot;, &quot;The Life Pursuit&quot;, and &quot;Write about Love&quot;. In an interview at the end of 2013, Mick Cooke confirmed he had left the band on good terms.

The band received an &#x27;Outstanding Contribution to Music Award&#x27; at the NME Awards 2014.

In 2014, the band returned to the studio, recording in Atlanta, Georgia for their ninth studio album, along with announcing tour dates for various festivals and concerts across the world during 2014. Their ninth album &quot;Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance&quot; was released on 19 January 2015. It was their first album with Dave McGowan, who had been their touring bassist since 2011.

The Belle and Sebastian song &quot;There&#x27;s Too Much Love&quot; forms much of the soundtrack for the Brazilian film &quot;The Way He Looks&quot;, about a blind, gay teenage boy and his friends, released in 2014.

Belle and Sebastian performed at the Glastonbury Festival on 28 June 2015, on &#x27;The Other Stage&#x27; and at O2 Academy, Glasgow in March 2017 which was televised in the UK as part of the &#x27;BBC 6 MUSIC Presents Festival&#x27;.

===&quot;How to Solve Our Human Problems&quot;, &quot;A Bit of Previous&quot; and &quot;Late Developers&quot; (2017–present)===

In mid-2017, the band put out a new single, &quot;We Were Beautiful&quot;. During the same year, the band appeared in the news for a comical story that occurred during their US tour, in which they accidentally forgot Colburn in a North Dakota Walmart. In December 2017 and January and February 2018, the band released a trio of EPs under the name &quot;How to Solve Our Human Problems&quot;.

On 3 November 2018, the band announced that Dave McGowan had become a member.

In August 2019, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first Bowlie Weekender festival, Belle &amp; Sebastian held a third festival, dubbed the &quot;Boaty Weekender&quot;. Unlike the previous two festivals, the Boaty Weekender was held on a cruise ship in the Mediterranean Sea instead of UK holiday parks.

The band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;A Bit of Previous&quot;, was released in May 2022.

In January 2023, the band announced the surprise release of their twelfth studio album, &quot;Late Developers&quot;. Lead single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What You See in Me&quot; was released on 9 January 2023 with the album released on 13 January 2023.

<doc id="4279" wikidata="Q922117" url="?curid=4279" title="Broadcast domain">
<text>A broadcast domain is a logical division of a computer network, in which all nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer. A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments.

In terms of current popular technologies, any computer connected to the same Ethernet repeater or switch is a member of the same broadcast domain. Further, any computer connected to the same set of interconnected switches or repeaters is a member of the same broadcast domain. Routers and other network-layer devices form boundaries between broadcast domains.

The notion of a broadcast domain can be compared with a collision domain, which would be all nodes on the same set of inter-connected repeaters and divided by switches and network bridges. Collision domains are generally smaller than and contained within broadcast domains. While some data-link-layer devices are able to divide the collision domains, broadcast domains are only divided by network-layer devices such as routers or layer-3 switches. Separating VLANs divides broadcast domains as well.

== Further explanation ==
The distinction between broadcast and collision domains comes about because simple Ethernet and similar systems use a shared medium for communication. In simple Ethernet (without switches or bridges), data frames are transmitted to all other nodes on a network. Each receiving node checks the destination address of each frame and simply ignores any frame not addressed to its own MAC address or the broadcast address.

Switches act as buffers, receiving and analyzing the frames from each connected network segment. Frames destined for nodes connected to the originating segment are not forwarded by the switch. Frames destined for a specific node on a different segment are sent only to that segment. Only broadcast frames are forwarded to all other segments. This reduces unnecessary traffic and collisions.

In such a switched network, transmitted frames may not be received by all other reachable nodes. Nominally, only broadcast frames will be received by all other nodes. Collisions are localized to the physical-layer network segment they occur on. Thus, the broadcast domain is the entire inter-connected layer-2 network, and the segments connected to each switch or bridge port are each a collision domain. To clarify; repeaters do not divide collision domains but switches do. This means that since switches have become commonplace, collision domains are isolated to the specific segment between the switch port and the connected node. Full-duplex segments, or links, don&#x27;t form a collision domain as there is a dedicated channel between each transmitter and receiver, eliminating the possibility of collisions.

==Broadcast domain control==
With a sufficiently sophisticated switch, it is possible to create a network in which a broadcast domain is strictly controlled. One implementation of this concept is a private VLAN. Another implementation is possible with Linux and iptables. One analogy is that by creating multiple VLANs, the number of broadcast domains increases, but the size of each broadcast domain decreases. This is because a VLAN defines a broadcast domain.

This is achieved by designating one or more &quot;provider&quot; nodes, either by MAC address or switch port. Broadcast frames are allowed to originate from these sources and are sent to all other nodes. Broadcast frames from all other sources are directed only to the provider nodes. Traffic from other sources not destined to the provider nodes (peer-to-peer traffic) is blocked.

The result is a network based on a nominally shared transmission system; like Ethernet, but in which client nodes cannot communicate with each other, only with the provider. Allowing direct data link layer communication between client nodes exposes the network to various security attacks, such as ARP spoofing.

<text>Beechcraft is an American brand of civil aviation and military aircraft owned by Textron Aviation since 2014, headquartered in Wichita, Kansas. Originally, it was a brand of Beech Aircraft Corporation, an American manufacturer of general aviation, commercial, and military aircraft, ranging from light single-engined aircraft to twin-engined turboprop transports, business jets, and military trainers. Beech later became a division of Raytheon and then Hawker Beechcraft before a bankruptcy sale turned its assets over to Textron (parent company of Beech&#x27;s historical cross-town Wichita rival, Cessna Aircraft Company). It remains a brand of Textron Aviation.

== History ==

Beech Aircraft Company was founded in Wichita, Kansas, in 1932 by Walter Beech as president, his wife Olive Ann Beech as secretary, Ted A. Wells as vice president of engineering, K. K. Shaul as treasurer, and investor C. G. Yankey as vice president. The company began operations in an idle Cessna factory. With designer Ted Wells, they developed the first aircraft under the Beechcraft name, the classic Beechcraft Model 17 Staggerwing, which first flew in November 1932. Over 750 Staggerwings were built, with 352 manufactured for the United States Army Air Forces and 67 for the United States Navy during World War II.

Beechcraft was not Beech&#x27;s first company, as he had previously formed Travel Air in 1924 and the design numbers used at Beechcraft followed the sequence started at Travel Air, and were then continued at Curtiss-Wright, after Travel Air had been absorbed into the much larger company in 1929. Beech had become president of Curtiss-Wright&#x27;s airplane division and VP of sales, but was dissatisfied with being so far removed from aircraft production. He quit to form Beechcraft, using the original Travel Air facilities and employing many of the same people. Model numbers prior to 11/11000 were built under the &quot;Travel Air&quot; name, while Curtiss-Wright built the CW-12, 14, 15, and 16 as well as previous successful Travel Air models (mostly the model 4).

In 1942 Beech won its first Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award production award and became one of the elite five percent of war contracting firms in the country to win five straight awards for production efficiency, mostly for the production of the Beechcraft Model 18 which remains in widespread use worldwide. Beechcraft ranked 69th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

After the war, the Staggerwing was replaced by the revolutionary Beechcraft Bonanza with a distinctive V-tail. Perhaps the best known Beech aircraft, the single-engined Bonanza has been manufactured in various models since 1947. The Bonanza has had the longest production run of any airplane, past or present, in the world. Other important Beech aircraft are the King Air and Super King Air line of twin-engined turboprops, in production since 1964, the Baron, a twin-engined variant of the Bonanza, and the Beechcraft Model 18, originally a business transport and commuter airliner from the late 1930s through the 1960s, which remains in active service as a cargo transport.

In 1950, Olive Ann Beech was installed as president and CEO of the company, after the sudden death of her husband from a heart attack on November 29 of that year. She continued as CEO until Beech was purchased by Raytheon Company on February 8, 1980. Ted Wells had been replaced as chief engineer by Herbert Rawdon, who remained at the post until his retirement in the early 1960s.

Throughout much of the mid-to-late 20th century, Beechcraft was considered one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; in the field of general aviation manufacturing, along with Cessna and Piper Aircraft.

In 1973, Beechcraft found Beechcraft Heritage Museum to host its historical aircraft.

In 1994, Raytheon merged Beechcraft with the Hawker product line it had acquired in 1993 from British Aerospace, forming Raytheon Aircraft Company. In 2002, the Beechcraft brand was revived to again designate the Wichita-produced aircraft. In 2006, Raytheon sold Raytheon Aircraft to Goldman Sachs creating Hawker Beechcraft. Since its inception Beechcraft has resided in Wichita, Kansas, also the home of chief competitor Cessna, the birthplace of Learjet and of Stearman, whose trainers were used in large numbers during WW II.

The entry into bankruptcy of Hawker Beechcraft on May 3, 2012, ended with its emergence on February 16, 2013, as a new entity, Beechcraft Corporation, with the Hawker Beechcraft name being retired. The new and much smaller company produce the King Air line of aircraft as well as the T-6 and AT-6 military trainer/attack aircraft, as well as the piston-powered single-engined Bonanza and twin-engined Baron aircraft. The jet line was discontinued, but the new company continues to support the aircraft already produced with parts, plus engineering and airworthiness documentation.

By October 2013, the company, now financially turned around, was up for sale.

On December 26, 2013, Textron agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale was concluded in the first half of 2014, with government approval. Textron CEO Scott Donnelly indicated that Beechcraft and Cessna would be combined to form a new light aircraft manufacturing concern, Textron Aviation, that would result in US$65M–$85M in annual savings over keeping the companies separate. Textron has kept both the Beechcraft and Cessna names as separate brands.

<doc id="4283" wikidata="Q609030" url="?curid=4283" title="Battle of Peleliu">
<text>The Battle of Peleliu, codenamed Operation Stalemate II by the US military, was fought between the United States and Japan during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign of World War II, from 15 September to 27 November 1944, on the island of Peleliu.

US Marines of the 1st Marine Division and then soldiers of the US Army&#x27;s 81st Infantry Division fought to capture an airfield on the small coral island of Peleliu. The battle was part of a larger offensive campaign known as Operation Forager, which ran from June to November 1944 in the Pacific Theater.

Major General William Rupertus, the commander of the 1st Marine Division, predicted that the island would be secured within four days. However, after repeated Imperial Japanese Army defeats in previous island campaigns, Japan had developed new island-defense tactics and well-crafted fortifications, which allowed them to offer stiff resistance and extended the battle to more than two months. The heavily outnumbered Japanese defenders put up such staunch resistance, often fighting to the death in the name of the Japanese Emperor, that the island became known in Japanese as the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Island.&quot;

In the US, the battle was controversial because of the island&#x27;s negligible strategic value and the high casualty rate incurred by American troops during the fighting, which exceeded that of all other amphibious operations during the Pacific War. The National Museum of the Marine Corps called it &quot;the bitterest battle of the war for the Marines&quot;.

==Background==
By 1944, American victories in the Southwest and Central Pacific had brought the war closer to Japan, with American bombers able to strike at the Japanese main islands from air bases secured during the Mariana Islands campaign (June–August 1944). There was disagreement among the U.S. Joint Chiefs over two proposed strategies to defeat the Japanese Empire. The strategy proposed by General Douglas MacArthur called for the recapture of the Philippines, followed by the capture of Okinawa, then an attack on the Japanese home islands. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz favored a more direct strategy of bypassing the Philippines but seizing Okinawa and Taiwan as staging areas to an attack on the Japanese mainland, followed by the future invasion of Japan&#x27;s southernmost islands.

The 1st Marine Division had already been chosen to make the assault. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt traveled to Pearl Harbor to personally meet both MacArthur and Nimitz and hear their arguments. In the end, MacArthur&#x27;s strategy was chosen. However, before MacArthur could retake the Philippines, the Palau Islands, specifically Peleliu and Angaur, were to be neutralized and an airfield built to protect the southern flank of MacArthur&#x27;s planned landings on the Philippines.

==Preparations==
===Japanese===

By 1944, Peleliu was occupied by about 11,000 Japanese troops of the 14th Infantry Division, along with a handful of Korean laborers. Considered a crack unit, the division had been detached from the Kwantung Army in Manchuria to garrison Peleliu after the fall of the Marshall Islands earlier in 1944, and had arrived on the island in May. Colonel Kunio Nakagawa, commander of the division&#x27;s 2nd Regiment, led the preparations for the island&#x27;s defense. 

After their losses in the Solomons, Gilberts, Marshalls and Marianas, the Imperial Japanese Army assembled a research team to develop new island-defense tactics. Previously, Japanese island garrisons had heavily contested enemy landings on the beach itself, which rendered them highly vulnerable to naval bombardment. Abandoning this model, the Japanese formulated new tactics that envisioned only a token defense of the landing beaches, and instead hinged upon waging a protracted struggle utilizing more defensible terrain in the island interior. Peleliu&#x27;s steep, twisting coral ridges were ideally suited for such a defense in depth. Colonel Nakagawa utilized this rough terrain to his advantage by ordering the construction of a system of heavily fortified bunkers, caves, and other subterranean positions, all interlocked in a &quot;honeycomb&quot; system. Traditional &quot;banzai charge&quot; attacks were to be discontinued, as they were both wasteful of manpower and ineffective. These changes in tactics were designed to force the Americans into a war of attrition, compelling them to spend more troops, materiel and time to secure Japanese island garrisons.
Nakagawa&#x27;s defenses were centered on Peleliu&#x27;s highest point, Umurbrogol Mountain, a collection of hills and steep ridges located at the center of Peleliu and overlooking a large portion of the island, including the crucial airfield. The Umurbrogol contained some 500 limestone caves, connected via tunnel by Japanese engineers. Many of these caves were former mine shafts developed by Nanyo Kohatsu Kaisha (South Seas Development Company), a Japanese firm established in 1921 primarily to develop the sugar industry in Saipan, where its headquarters were located. However, the company also owned and worked the phosphate deposits on Peleliu. The phosphate material was mined with native labor and transported via narrow gauge railcars operated by manpower to a phosphate refinery located at the wharf on Peleliu.

The mines and caves were turned into defensive positions. Engineers added sliding armored steel doors with multiple openings to many cave entrances, providing extra protection and concealment for both artillery and machine guns. Cave entrances were opened or altered to be slanted as a defense against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast tunnel and trench system throughout central Peleliu, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking interior lines.

The Japanese garrison was well armed with  and mortars and  anti-aircraft cannons, backed by a light tank unit and an anti-aircraft detachment. The Japanese also used the beach terrain to their advantage. The northern end of the landing beaches faced a coral promontory that overlooked the beaches from a small peninsula, a spot later known to the Marines who assaulted it simply as &quot;The Point&quot;. Holes were blasted into the Point to accommodate a gun and six 20 mm cannons. The positions were then sealed shut, leaving only a thin slit to fire on the beaches. The Japanese constructed similar positions along the stretch of landing beaches on the western shore of Peleliu.

The beaches were also filled with thousands of obstacles for the landing craft, principally mines and a large number of heavy artillery shells buried with the fuses exposed, designed to explode when they were run over. Nakagawa placed a battalion along the beach to defend against the landing, but this unit was meant to merely delay the inevitable American advance inland. Neither Nakagawa nor his superior officers expected the garrison to survive if Peleliu was attacked, and Japanese military planners made no contingencies to evacuate any survivors. 

===American===
Unlike the Japanese, who drastically altered their tactics for the upcoming battle, the American invasion plan was unchanged from that of previous amphibious landings, even after suffering 3,000 casualties and enduring two months of delaying tactics while overcoming entrenched Japanese defenders at the Battle of Biak. On Peleliu, American planners chose to land on the southwest beaches because of their proximity to the airfield on south Peleliu. The 1st Marine Regiment, commanded by Colonel Lewis B. &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller, was to land on the northern end of the beaches. The 5th Marine Regiment, under Colonel Harold Harris, would land in the center, and the 7th Marine Regiment, under Colonel Herman Hanneken, would land at the southern end.

The division&#x27;s artillery regiment, the 11th Marines under Colonel William Harrison, would land after the infantry regiments. The plan was for the 1st and 7th Marines to push inland, guarding the 5th Marines&#x27; flanks and allowing them to capture the airfield located directly to the center of the landing beaches. The 5th Marines were to push across to the eastern shore of Peleliu, cutting the island in half. The 1st Marines would push north into the Umurbrogol, while the 7th Marines would clear the southern end of the island. Only one battalion was held in reserve, with the U.S. Army&#x27;s 81st Infantry Division available for support from Angaur, just south of Peleliu.

On 4 September the Marines shipped off from their station on Pavuvu, north of Guadalcanal, a trip across the Pacific to Peleliu. A Navy Underwater Demolition Team cleared the beaches of some obstacles, while warships began their pre-invasion bombardment of Peleliu on 12 September.

The battleships , , , and , heavy cruisers , , and , and light cruisers , and , led by the command ship , subjected the island to a massive three-day bombardment, pausing only to permit air strikes from the three aircraft carriers, five light aircraft carriers, and eleven escort carriers that sailed with the attack force. A total of 519 rounds of shells, 1,845 rounds of shells and 1,793 bombs pounded Peleliu during this period.

The Americans believed the bombardment to be successful, as Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf claimed that the Navy had run out of targets. In reality, most Japanese soldiers survived; even the battalion left to defend the beaches was virtually unscathed. During the initial American assault, the island&#x27;s defenders exercised unusual firing discipline to avoid giving away their positions. However, the bombardment destroyed Japan&#x27;s aircraft on the island and the buildings surrounding the airfield. The Japanese remained in their fortified positions, waiting to attack the American landing troops.

==Battle==
===Landing===
US Marines began landing on Peleliu at 08:32 on 15 September. The 1st Marines landed to the north on White Beach 1 and 2, while the 5th and 7th Marines landed to the center and south on Orange Beach 1, 2, and 3. As the additional landing craft approached the beaches, the Marines on shore were caught in a crossfire when the Japanese opened the steel doors guarding their positions and began firing artillery. The positions on the coral promontories guarding each flank fired on the Marines with 47 mm guns and 20 mm cannons. By 09:30 the Japanese had destroyed 60 LVTs and DUKWs.
The 1st Marines were quickly bogged down by heavy fire from the high coral ridge on their left flank, &quot;The Point&quot;. Puller&#x27;s LVT was hit by a dud high velocity artillery round, and his communications section was destroyed on its way to the beach by a hit from a 47 mm round. The 7th Marines faced a cluttered Orange Beach 3, with natural and man-made obstacles forcing the LVTs to bunch together and approach in column.

The 5th Marines made the most progress on the first day, aided by cover provided by coconut groves. As they approached the airfield they were met with Nakagawa&#x27;s first counterattack. His armored tank company attacked across the airfield, attempting to push the Marines back to the beach, but was swiftly engaged by tanks, howitzers, naval guns, and dive bombers. Nakagawa&#x27;s tanks and escorting infantrymen were quickly destroyed.

At the end of the first day, the Americans held their stretch of landing beaches but little else. Their biggest push in the south moved inland, but the 1st Marines to the north made very little progress in the face of extremely heavy Japanese resistance. The Marines had suffered 200 dead and 900 wounded on the first day. Rupertus, still unaware of his enemy&#x27;s change of tactics, believed the Japanese defenses would quickly crumble since their perimeter had been broken.

===Airfield/South Peleliu===
On 16 September the 5th Marines moved to capture the airfield and push toward Peleliu&#x27;s eastern shore. The entire regiment crossed the airfield simultaneously, enduring heavy artillery fire from the highlands to the north, and suffered heavy casualties in the process. After capturing the airfield, they rapidly advanced to the eastern end of Peleliu, leaving the island&#x27;s southern defenders to be destroyed by the 7th Marines.

This area was hotly contested by the Japanese, who still occupied numerous pillboxes. Heat indices were around , and the Marines suffered high casualties from heat exhaustion. Further complicating the situation, the Marines&#x27; drinking water was distributed in empty oil drums, which contaminated the water with the oil residue. Regardless, by 23 September the 5th and 7th Marines had accomplished their objectives, holding the airfield and the southern portion of the island, although the airfield remained under threat of sustained Japanese fire from the heights of Umurbrogol Mountain until the end of the battle.

American forces began using the airfield on 17 September. Stinson OY-1 Sentinels from VMO-3 began aerial spotting missions for Marine artillery and naval gunfire support. On 26 September Marine F4U Corsairs from VMF-114 landed on the airstrip. The Corsairs began dive-bombing missions across Peleliu, firing rockets into open cave entrances in support of infantry attacks, and dropping napalm. This was only the second time that napalm had been used in the Pacific theater, and it proved effective at burning away vegetation hiding spider holes, usually killing their occupants. The time from takeoff to the target area for the Corsairs operating from Peleliu Airfield was very short, sometimes only 10 to 15 seconds. Most pilots did not bother to raise their landing gear, leaving them down during the strike. After a strike was completed, the Corsair simply turned back into the landing pattern again.

===The Point===
&quot;The Point&quot; at the end of the northern landing beaches continued to cause heavy Marine casualties from the enfilading fire of Japanese heavy machine guns and anti-tank artillery across the landing beaches. Puller ordered Captain George P. Hunt, commander of K Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, to capture the position. Hunt&#x27;s company approached &quot;The Point&quot; short on supplies, having lost most of its machine guns while approaching the beaches. Hunt&#x27;s second platoon was pinned down for nearly a day in an anti-tank trench between fortifications. The rest of his company was threatened when the Japanese cut a hole in their line, surrounding his unit and leaving his right flank cut off.

A rifle platoon then began knocking out the Japanese gun positions one by one. Using smoke grenades for concealment, the platoon swept through each hole, destroying the positions via a combination of rifle grenades and close-quarters combat. After knocking out six machine gun positions, the Marines faced a cave housing the 47 mm gun. A lieutenant blinded the gun crew with a smoke grenade, allowing Corporal Henry W. Hahn to launch a grenade through the cave&#x27;s aperture. The grenade detonated the 47 mm&#x27;s shells, forcing the Japanese defenders out with their bodies alight and their ammunition belts exploding around their waists. A Marine fire team was positioned on the flank of the cave, where the emerging occupants were gunned down.

K Company had captured &quot;The Point&quot;, but Nakagawa again counterattacked. Over the next 30 hours the Japanese counterattacked four times against a single company, critically low on supplies, out of water and virtually surrounded. The Marines had to resort to hand-to-hand combat to fend off the Japanese attackers. By the time reinforcements arrived, the company had successfully repulsed all the Japanese attacks, but had been reduced to 18 men, suffering 157 casualties during the battle for The Point. Hunt and Hahn were both awarded the Navy Cross for their actions.

===Ngesebus Island===
The 5th Marines—after securing the airfield—were sent to capture Ngesebus Island, just north of Peleliu. Ngesebus was occupied by multiple Japanese artillery positions and was the site of an airfield still under construction. The tiny island was connected to Peleliu by a narrow causeway, but 5th Marines commander Harris opted instead to make a shore-to-shore amphibious landing, predicting the causeway to be an obvious target for the island&#x27;s defenders.

Harris coordinated a pre-landing bombardment of the island on 28 September, carried out by Army guns, naval guns, howitzers from the 11th Marines, strafing runs from VMF-114&#x27;s Corsairs and fire from the approaching LVTs. Unlike the Navy&#x27;s bombardment of Peleliu, Harris&#x27; assault on Ngesebus successfully killed most of the Japanese defenders. The Marines still faced opposition in the ridges and caves, but the island fell quickly, with relatively light casualties for the 5th Marines. They had suffered 15 killed and 33 wounded and inflicted 470 casualties on the Japanese.

===Bloody Nose Ridge===
After capturing &quot;The Point&quot;, the 1st Marines moved north into the Umurbrogol pocket, nicknamed &quot;Bloody Nose Ridge&quot; by the Marines. Puller led his men in numerous assaults, but each incurred severe casualties from Japanese fire. The 1st Marines&#x27; movement was constrained by the narrow paths between the ridges, with each ridge fortification able to support the others with direct and indirect fires.
The Marines took increasingly heavy casualties as they slowly advanced through the ridges. The Japanese again showed unusual fire discipline, striking only when they could inflict maximum casualties. As casualties mounted, Japanese snipers began to take aim at stretcher bearers, knowing that if stretcher bearers were injured or killed, more would have to return to replace them, providing more targets. In small groups, Japanese soldiers also frequently attempted to infiltrate the American lines at night. The Marines built two-man fighting holes, so one Marine could sleep while the other kept watch for infiltrators.

A particularly intense engagement occurred on Bloody Nose Ridge, when the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines—under the command of Major Raymond Davis—attacked Hill 100. Over six days of fighting, the battalion suffered 71% casualties. Captain Everett P. Pope and his company penetrated deep into the ridges, leading his remaining 90 men to seize what he thought was Hill 100. It took a day&#x27;s fighting to reach what he thought was the crest of the hill, which was in fact another ridge occupied by more Japanese defenders. 
Trapped at the base of the ridge, Pope set up a small defensive perimeter, which was attacked relentlessly by the Japanese throughout the night. The Marines ran out of ammunition and had to fight the attackers with knives and fists, even resorting to throwing coral rock and empty ammunition boxes at the Japanese. Pope and his men managed to hold out until dawn, which brought on more deadly fire. When they evacuated the position, only nine men remained. Pope later received the Medal of Honor for the action.

The Japanese inflicted 70% casualties on Puller&#x27;s 1st Marines, or 1,749 men. After six days of fighting in the ridges of the Umurbrogol, Geiger sent elements of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 81st Infantry Division to Peleliu to relieve the regiment. The 321st Regiment Combat Team landed on the western beaches of Peleliu—at the northern end of Umurbrogol mountain—on 23 September. The warren of ridges still occupied by Japanese troops became colloquially known as &quot;the Pocket&quot; by American forces on Peleliu. The 321st and the 7th Marines had fully encircled this &quot;Pocket&quot; by 24 September, D+9.

By 15 October the 7th Marines had suffered 46% casualties, and Geiger relieved them with the 5th Marines. Col. Harris adopted siege tactics, using bulldozers and flamethrower tanks to methodically destroy Japanese positions, and pushed into the ridges from the north. On 30 October the 81st Infantry Division took over command of Peleliu. It would take another six weeks, using the same tactics as the Marines, to finally reduce &quot;The Pocket&quot;.

After emerging victorious in the Battle of Angaur, the 81st Infantry Division was ordered to assist the 1st Marine Division in their efforts to seize Peleliu. The 81st Infantry Division eventually relieved the 1st Marine Division, and assumed command of combat operations on Peleliu. The 81st Infantry Division remained engaged on the island until the end of organized Japanese resistance on 18 January 1945.

On 24 November Nakagawa proclaimed, &quot;Our sword is broken and we have run out of spears&quot;. He then burnt his regimental colors and performed ritual suicide. He was posthumously promoted to lieutenant general for his concerted defensive campaign on Peleliu. On 27 November the island was declared secure, ending the 73-day-long battle.

A Japanese lieutenant with twenty-six 2nd Infantry soldiers and eight 45th Guard Force sailors held out in the caves on Peleliu until 22 April 1947, only surrendering after a former Japanese admiral convinced them the war was over.

==Aftermath==
The reduction of the Japanese positions in &quot;the Pocket&quot; around Umurbrogol mountain has been called the most difficult fight that the U.S. military encountered during the entire war. The 1st Marine Division was severely mauled, and remained out of action until the invasion of Okinawa on 1 April 1945. In total, the 1st Marine Division suffered over 6,500 casualties during a month of combat on Peleliu, over one third of the entire division. The 81st Infantry Division also suffered heavy losses, incurring 3,300 casualties during its tenure on the island.

Postwar statisticians calculated that it took U.S. forces over 1,500 rounds of ammunition to kill each individual Japanese defender, and that the Americans expended 13.32 million rounds of .30-calibre, 1.52 million rounds of .45-calibre, 693,657 rounds of .50-calibre bullets, 118,262 hand grenades, and 150,000 mortar rounds over the course of the battle.

The battle was controversial in the United States. Many felt that too many American lives had been lost for an island that had little strategic value. The Japanese defenders lacked the means to interfere with potential US operations in the Philippines, and the airfield captured on Peleliu did not play a key role in any subsequent operations. Instead, Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands was used as a staging base for the invasion of Okinawa. The high casualty rate exceeded all other amphibious operations during the Pacific War.

In addition, few news reports were published about the battle because Rupertus&#x27; prediction of a &quot;three days&quot; victory motivated only six war reporters to report from shore. The battle was also overshadowed by MacArthur&#x27;s return to the Philippines and the Allies&#x27; push towards Germany in Europe.

The battles for Angaur and Peleliu offered the Americans a preview of future Japanese island defense, but American planners made few adjustments to their tactics before the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Naval bombardment prior to amphibious assault at Iwo Jima was only slightly more effective than at Peleliu, but at Okinawa the preliminary shelling was greatly improved. Frogmen performing underwater demolition at Iwo Jima confused the enemy by sweeping both coasts, but later alerted Japanese defenders to the exact assault beaches at Okinawa. American ground forces at Peleliu gained experience in assaulting heavily fortified positions, which they would encounter again on both Iwo Jima and Okinawa.

At the recommendation of Admiral William Halsey Jr., the planned occupation of Yap Island in the Caroline Islands was canceled. Halsey actually recommended that the landings on Peleliu and Angaur be canceled, too, and their Marines and soldiers be sent to Leyte Island instead, but this plan was overruled by Nimitz.

In his book &quot;With the Old Breed&quot;, Eugene Sledge describes his experiences in the Battle for Peleliu. One of the final scenes in &quot;Parer&#x27;s War&quot;, a 2014 Australian television film, shows the Battle of Peleliu recorded by Damien Parer with his camera at the time of his death.

<text>The Battle of Stalingrad (17 July 19422 February 1943) was a major battle on the Eastern Front of World War II, beginning when Nazi Germany and its Axis allies attacked and became locked in a protracted struggle with the Soviet Union for control over the Soviet city of Stalingrad (now known as Volgograd) in southern Russia. The battle was characterized by fierce close-quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in aerial raids; the battle epitomized urban warfare, being the single largest and costliest urban battle in military history. It was the bloodiest and fiercest battle of the entirety of World War II—and arguably in all of human history—as both sides suffered tremendous casualties amidst ferocious fighting in and around the city. The battle is commonly regarded as the turning point in the European theatre of World War II, as Germany&#x27;s was forced to withdraw a considerable amount of military forces from other regions to replace losses on the Eastern Front. By the time the hostilities ended, the German 6th Army and 4th Panzer Army had been destroyed and Army Group B was routed. The Soviets&#x27; victory at Stalingrad shifted the Eastern Front&#x27;s balance of power in their favour, while also boosting the morale of the Red Army.

Both sides placed great strategic importance on Stalingrad, for it was the largest industrial centre of the Soviet Union and an important transport hub on the Volga River: controlling Stalingrad meant gaining access to the oil fields of the Caucasus and having supreme authority over the Volga River. The city also held significant symbolic importance because it bore the name of Joseph Stalin, the incumbent leader of the Soviet Union. As the conflict progressed, Germany&#x27;s fuel supplies dwindled and thus drove it to focus on moving deeper into Soviet territory and taking the country&#x27;s oil fields at any cost. The German military first clashed with the Red Army&#x27;s Stalingrad Front on the distant approaches to Stalingrad on 17 July. On 23 August, the 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army launched their offensive with support from intensive bombing raids by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, which reduced much of the city to rubble. The battle soon degenerated into house-to-house fighting, which escalated drastically as both sides continued pouring reinforcements into the city. By mid-November, the Germans, at great cost, had pushed the Soviet defenders back into narrow zones along the Volga&#x27;s west bank. However, winter set in within a few months and conditions became particularly brutal, with temperatures often dropping tens of degrees below freezing. In addition to fierce urban combat, brutal trench warfare was prevalent at Stalingrad as well.

On 19 November, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack targeting the Romanian armies protecting the 6th Army&#x27;s flanks. The Axis flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was encircled. Adolf Hitler was determined to hold the city for Germany at all costs and forbade the 6th Army from trying a breakout; instead, attempts were made to supply it by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Though the Soviets were successful in preventing the Germans from making enough airdrops to the trapped Axis armies at Stalingrad, heavy fighting continued for another two months. On 2 February 1943, the 6th Army, having exhausted their ammunition and food, finally capitulated after several months of battle, making it the first of Hitler&#x27;s field armies to have surrendered.

In modern Russia, the legacy of the Red Army&#x27;s victory at Stalingrad is commemorated among the Days of Military Honour. It is also well known in many other countries that belonged to the Allied powers, and has thus become ingrained in popular culture. Likewise, in a number of the post-Soviet states, the Battle of Stalingrad is recognized as an important aspect of what is known as the Great Patriotic War.

==Background==
By the spring of 1942, despite the failure of Operation Barbarossa to defeat the Soviet Union in a single campaign, the Wehrmacht had captured vast territories, including Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic republics. On the Western Front, Germany held most of Europe, the U-boat offensive was curbing American support, and in North Africa, Erwin Rommel had just captured Tobruk. In the east, the Germans had stabilized a front running from Leningrad to Rostov, with several minor salients. Hitler remained confident of breaking the Red Army, despite heavy losses west of Moscow in the winter of 1941–42, because large parts of Army Group Centre had been rested and re-equipped. Hitler decided that the 1942 summer campaign would target the southern Soviet Union. The initial objectives around Stalingrad were to destroy the city&#x27;s industrial capacity and block the Volga River traffic, crucial for connecting the Caucasus and Caspian Sea to central Russia. The capture of Stalingrad would also disrupt Lend-Lease supplies via the Persian Corridor.

On 23 July 1942, Hitler expanded the campaign&#x27;s objectives to include occupying Stalingrad, a city with immense propaganda value due to its name, which bore that of the Soviet leader. Hitler ordered the annihilation of Stalingrad&#x27;s population, declaring that after its capture, all male citizens would be killed and women and children deported due to their &quot;thoroughly communistic&quot; nature. The city&#x27;s fall was intended to secure the northern and western flanks of the German advance on Baku to capture its petroleum resources. This expansion of objectives stemmed from German overconfidence and an underestimation of Soviet reserves.

Meanwhile, Stalin, convinced that the main German attack would target Moscow, prioritized defending the Soviet capital. As the Soviet winter counteroffensive of 1941–1942 culminated in March, the Soviet high command began planning for the summer campaign. Although Stalin desired a general offensive, he was dissuaded by Chief of the General Staff Boris Shaposhnikov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff Aleksandr Vasilevsky, and Western Main Direction commander Georgy Zhukov. Ultimately, Stalin instructed that the summer campaign be based on &quot;active strategic defense,&quot; while also ordering local offensives across the Eastern Front. Southwestern Main Direction commander Semyon Timoshenko proposed an attack from the Izyum salient south of Kharkov to encircle and destroy the German 6th Army. Despite opposition from Shaposhnikov and Vasilevsky, Stalin approved the plan.

After delays in troop movements and logistical challenges, the Kharkov operation began on 12 May. The Soviets achieved initial success, prompting 6th Army commander Friedrich Paulus to request reinforcements. However, a German counterattack on 13 May halted the Soviet advance. On 17 May, Ewald von Kleist&#x27;s forces launched Operation Fridericus I, encircling and destroying much of the Soviet forces in the ensuing Second Battle of Kharkov. The defeat at Kharkov left the Soviets vulnerable to the German summer offensive. Despite the setback, Stalin continued to prioritize defending Moscow, allocating only limited reinforcements to the Southwestern Front.

The commitment of panzer divisions needed for Case Blue to the Second Battle of Kharkov further delayed the offensive&#x27;s start. On 1 June, Hitler modified the summer plans, delaying Case Blue to 20 June after preliminary operations in Ukraine.

==Prelude==


Army Group South was selected for a sprint forward through the southern Russian steppes into the Caucasus to capture the vital Soviet oil fields there. The planned summer offensive, code-named &quot;Fall Blau&quot; (Case Blue), was to include the German 6th, 17th, 4th Panzer and 1st Panzer Armies.

Hitler intervened, however, ordering the Army Group to split in two. Army Group South (A), under the command of Wilhelm List, was to continue advancing south towards the Caucasus as planned with the 17th Army and First Panzer Army. Army Group South (B), including Paulus&#x27;s 6th Army and Hermann Hoth&#x27;s 4th Panzer Army, was to move east towards the Volga and Stalingrad. Army Group B was commanded by General Maximilian von Weichs.

The start of &quot;Case Blue&quot; had been planned for late May 1942. However, a number of German and Romanian units that were to take part in &quot;Blau&quot; were besieging Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula. Delays in ending the siege pushed back the start date for &quot;Blau&quot; several times, and the city did not fall until early July.

Operation Fridericus I by the Germans against the &quot;Izyum bulge&quot;, pinched off the Soviet salient in the Second Battle of Kharkov, and resulted in the envelopment of a large Soviet force between 17 May and 29 May. Similarly, Operation Wilhelm attacked Voltshansk on 13 June, and Operation Fridericus attacked Kupiansk on 22 June.

&quot;Blau&quot; finally opened as Army Group South began its attack into southern Russia on 28 June 1942. The German offensive achieved rapid success, as Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units outflanked them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around Millerovo, Rostov Oblast, a week later. Meanwhile, the Hungarian 2nd Army and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an assault on Voronezh, capturing the city on 5 July.

The initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive road block resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer choked the roads, stopping both in their tracks while they cleared the mess of thousands of vehicles. The traffic jam is thought to have delayed the advance by at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.

By the end of July, Soviet forces were pushed back across the Don River. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers are only apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don. The Germans began using the armies of their Italian, Hungarian and Romanian allies to guard their left (northern) flank. Italian actions were also mentioned in official German communiques. Italian forces were generally held in little regard by the Germans, and were accused of low morale: in reality, the Italian divisions fought comparatively well, with the 3rd Infantry Division &quot;Ravenna&quot; and 5th Infantry Division &quot;Cosseria&quot; showing spirit, according to a German liaison officer. Italian forces were forced to retreat only after a massive armoured attack in which German reinforcements failed to arrive in time.

To the south, Army Group A was pushing far into the Caucasus, but the advance slowed as supply lines grew overextended. The two German army groups were too far apart to support one another.

After German intentions became clear in July, Stalin appointed General Andrey Yeryomenko commander of the Southeastern Front on 1 August 1942. Yeryomenko and Commissar Nikita Khrushchev were tasked with planning the defence of Stalingrad. Beyond the Volga River on the eastern boundary of Stalingrad, additional Soviet units were formed into the 62nd Army under Lieutenant General Vasiliy Chuikov on 11 September 1942. Tasked with holding the city at all costs, Chuikov proclaimed, &quot;We will defend the city or die in the attempt.&quot; The battle earned him one of his two Hero of the Soviet Union awards.

==Orders of battle==
=== Red Army ===
During the defence of Stalingrad, the Red Army deployed five armies in and around the city (28th, 51st, 57th, 62nd and 64th Armies); and an additional nine armies in the encirclement counteroffensive (24th, 65th, 66th Armies and 16th Air Army from the north as part of the Don Front offensive, and 1st Guards Army, 5th Tank, 21st Army, 2nd Air Army and 17th Air Army from the south as part of the Southwestern Front).

===Axis===
==Attack on Stalingrad==
===Initial attack===
German forces first clashed with the Stalingrad Front on 17 July on the distant approaches to Stalingrad, in the bend of the Don. A significant clash in the early stages of the battle was fought at Kalach, in which &quot;We had had to pay a high cost in men and material ... left on the Kalach battlefield were numerous burnt-out or shot-up German tanks.&quot; Military historian David Glantz indicated that four hard-fought battles – collectively known as the Kotluban Operations – north of Stalingrad, where the Soviets made their greatest stand, decided Germany&#x27;s fate before the Nazis ever set foot in the city itself, and were a turning point in the war. Beginning in late August and lasting into October, the Soviets committed between two and four armies in hastily coordinated and poorly controlled attacks against the Germans&#x27; northern flank. The actions resulted in over 200,000 Soviet Army casualties but did slow the German assault.

The Germans formed bridgeheads across the Don on 20 August, with the 295th and 76th Infantry Divisions enabling the XIVth Panzer Corps &quot;to thrust to the Volga north of Stalingrad.&quot; The German 6th Army was only a few dozen kilometres from Stalingrad. The 4th Panzer Army, ordered south on 13 July to block the Soviet retreat &quot;weakened by the 17th Army and the 1st Panzer Army&quot;, had turned northwards to help take the city from the south. On 19 August, German forces were in position to launch an attack on the city.

On 23 August, the 6th Army reached the outskirts of Stalingrad in pursuit of the 62nd and 64th Armies, which had fallen back into the city. Kleist said after the war:

The Soviets had enough warning of the German advance to ship grain, cattle, and railway cars across the Volga out of harm&#x27;s way. This &quot;harvest victory&quot; left the city short of food even before the German attack began. Before the &quot;Heer&quot; reached the city itself, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had cut off shipping on the Volga. In the days between 25 and 31 July, 32 Soviet ships were sunk, with another nine crippled.

&quot;Generaloberst&quot; Wolfram von Richthofen&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; dropped some 1,000 tons of bombs on 23 August, with the aerial attack on Stalingrad being the most single intense aerial bombardment at that point on the Eastern Front, and the heaviest bombing raid that had ever taken place on the Eastern Front. At least 90% of the city&#x27;s housing stock was obliterated as a result. The Stalingrad Tractor Factory continued to turn out T-34 tanks up until German troops burst into the plant. The 369th (Croatian) Reinforced Infantry Regiment was the only non-German unit selected by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; to enter Stalingrad city during assault operations, with it fighting as part of the 100th Jäger Division.

Georgy Zhukov, who was deputy commander-in-chief and commander of Stalingrad&#x27;s defence during the battle, noted the importance of the battle, stating that:Stalin rushed all available troops to the east bank of the Volga, some from as far away as Siberia. Regular river ferries were quickly destroyed by the Luftwaffe, which then targeted troop barges being towed slowly across by tugs. It has been said that Stalin prevented civilians from leaving the city in the belief that their presence would encourage greater resistance from the city&#x27;s defenders. Civilians, including women and children, were put to work building trenchworks and protective fortifications. Casualties due to the air raid on 23 August and beyond are debated, as between 23 and 26 August, Soviet reports indicate 955 people were killed and another 1,181 wounded as a result of the bombing. However, death toll of civilians due to the bombing has been estimated to have been 40,000, or as many as 70,000, though these estimates may be exaggerated. Also estimated are 150,000 wounded.

The Soviet Air Force, the &quot;Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily&quot; (VVS), was swept aside by the Luftwaffe. The VVS bases in the immediate area lost 201 aircraft between 23 and 31 August, and despite meagre reinforcements of some 100 aircraft in August, it was left with just 192 serviceable aircraft, 57 of which were fighters.

Early on 23 August, the German 16th Panzer and 3rd Motorized Divisions attacked out of the Vertyachy bridgehead with a force 120 tanks and over 200 armored personnel carriers strong. The German attack broke through the 1382nd Rifle Regiment of the 87th Rifle Division and the 137th Tank Brigade, which were forced to retreat towards Dmitryevka. The 16th Panzer Division drove east towards the Volga, supported by the strikes of Henschel Hs 129 ground attack aircraft. Crossing the railway line to Stalingrad at 564 km Station around midday, both divisions continued their rush towards the river. Around 15:00, Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz&#x27;s Panzer Detachment and the &quot;kampfgruppe&quot; of the 2nd Battalion, 64th Panzer Grenadier Regiment from the 16th Panzer reached the area of Latashanka, Rynok, and Spartanovka, northern suburbs of Stalingrad, and the Stalingrad Tractor Factory.
A Soviet female soldier stated about the battle that:One of the first units to offer resistance in this area was the 1077th Anti-Aircraft Regiment, covering the Stalingrad Tractor Factory and the Volga ferry near Latashanka. The majority of the regiment was composed of men, but its directing and rangefinding crews and unit headquarters were made up of women. Several women also crewed anti-aircraft guns. The 1077th was notified of the German tanks&#x27; approach at 14:30 and its 6th Battery, dominating the Sukhaya Mechatka ravine, claimed the destruction of 28 German tanks. Later that day, its 3rd Battery on the road between Yerzovka and Stalingrad, saw particularly intense fighting against the 16th Panzer, reportedly fighting &quot;shot for shot.&quot; Two women were decorated for their actions that day, and the regiment&#x27;s report praised the &quot;exceptional steadfastness and heroism&quot; of the women soldiers. The regiment lost 35 guns, eighteen killed, 46 wounded, and 74 missing on 23 and 24 August. The 16th Panzer Division&#x27;s history mentioned its encounter with the regiment, claiming the destruction of 37 guns, and the unit&#x27;s surprise that its opponents had in part included women.

In the early stages of the battle, the NKVD organised poorly armed &quot;Workers&#x27; militias&quot; similar to those that had defended the city twenty-four years earlier, composed of civilians not directly involved in war production for immediate use in the battle. The civilians were often sent into battle without rifles. Staff and students from the local technical university formed a &quot;tank destroyer&quot; unit. They assembled tanks from leftover parts at the tractor factory. These tanks, unpainted and lacking gun-sights, were driven directly from the factory floor to the front line. They could only be aimed at point-blank range through the bore of their gun barrels. Chuikov later remarked that soldiers approaching the battle would say &quot;We are entering hell&quot;, but after one or two days, they said &quot;No, this isn&#x27;t hell, this is ten times worse than hell&quot;.

By the end of August, Army Group South (B) had finally reached the Volga, north of Stalingrad. Another advance to the river south of the city followed, while the Soviets abandoned their Rossoshka position for the inner defensive ring west of Stalingrad. The wings of the 6th Army and the 4th Panzer Army met near Jablotchni along the Zaritza on 2 September.

===September city battles===
A letter found on the body of a German officer described the insanity of the battle and brutal nature of the urban combat: Historian David Glantz stated that the grinding and brutal battle resembled &quot;the fighting on the Somme and at Verdun in 1916 more than it did the familiar blitzkrieg war of the previous three summers&quot;.

On 5 September, the Soviet 24th and 66th Armies organized a massive attack against XIV Panzer Corps. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; helped repel the offensive by heavily attacking Soviet artillery positions and defensive lines. The Soviets were forced to withdraw at midday after only a few hours. Of the 120 tanks the Soviets had committed, 30 were lost to air attack.

On 13 September, the battle for the city itself began. With German forces launching an attack which overran the small hill where the 62nd Soviet Army headquarters was established, in addition, the railway station was captured, and German forces advanced far enough to threaten the Volga landing stage.

Soviet operations were constantly hampered by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. On 18 September, the Soviet 1st Guards and 24th Army launched an offensive against VIII Army Corps at Kotluban. &quot;VIII. Fliegerkorps&quot; dispatched multiple waves of Stuka dive-bombers to prevent a breakthrough. The offensive was repelled. The Stukas claimed 41 of the 106 Soviet tanks knocked out that morning, while escorting Bf 109s destroyed 77 Soviet aircraft.

Lieutenant General Alexander Rodimtsev was in charge of the 13th Guards Rifle Division, and received one of two Hero of the Soviet Union awards issued during the battle for his actions. Stalin&#x27;s Order No. 227 of 27 July 1942 decreed that all commanders who ordered unauthorised retreats would be subject to a military tribunal. Blocking detachments composed of NKVD or regular troops were positioned behind Red Army units to prevent desertion and straggling, sometimes executing deserters and perceived malingerers. During the battle, the 62nd Army had the most arrests and executions: 203 in all, of which 49 were executed, while 139 were sent to penal companies and battalions. Blocking detachments of the Stalingrad and Don Fronts detained 51,758 men from the beginning of the battle to 15 October, with the majority returned to their units. Of those detained, the vast majority of which were from the Don Front, 980 were executed and 1,349 sent to penal companies. In the two-day period between 13 and 15 September, the 62nd Army blocking detachment detained 1,218 men, returning most to their units while shooting 21 men and arresting ten. Beevor claims that 13,500 Soviet soldiers were executed by Soviet authorities during the battle, however, this claim has been disputed.

By 12 September, at the time of their retreat into the city, the Soviet 62nd Army had been reduced to 90 tanks, 700 mortars and just 20,000 personnel. The remaining tanks were used as immobile strong-points within the city. The initial German attack on 14 September attempted to take the city in a rush. The 51st Army Corps&#x27; 295th Infantry Division went after the Mamayev Kurgan hill, the 71st attacked the central rail station and toward the central landing stage on the Volga, while 48th Panzer Corps attacked south of the Tsaritsa River. Though initially successful, the German attacks stalled in the face of Soviet reinforcements brought in from across the Volga. Rodimtsev&#x27;s 13th Guards Rifle Division had been hurried up to cross the river and join the defenders inside the city. Assigned to counterattack at the Mamayev Kurgan and at Railway Station No. 1, it suffered particularly heavy losses. Despite their losses, Rodimtsev&#x27;s troops were able to inflict similar damage on their opponents. By 26 September, the opposing 71st Infantry Division had half of its battalions considered exhausted, reduced from all of them being considered average in combat capability when the attack began twelve days earlier.

The brutality of the battle was noted in a journal found on German lieutenant Weiner of the 24th Panzer Division:

A ferocious battle raged for several days at the giant grain elevator in the south of the city. About fifty Red Army defenders, cut off from resupply, held the position for five days and fought off ten different assaults before running out of ammunition and water. Only forty dead Soviet fighters were found, though the Germans had thought there were many more due to the intensity of resistance. The Soviets burned large amounts of grain during their retreat in order to deny the enemy food. The grain elevator and silos were decided upon by Paulus to be the symbol of Stalingrad for a patch he was having designed to commemorate the battle after victory.

Mamayev Kurgan changed hands multiple times over the course of days, with fighting over the hill, rail station and Red Square being so intense that it was difficult to determine who was attacking and who was defending.

In another part of the city, a Soviet platoon under the command of Sergeant Yakov Pavlov fortified a four-story building that oversaw a square 300 meters from the river bank, which was later called &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s House&quot;. The soldiers surrounded it with minefields, set up machine-gun positions at the windows and breached the walls in the basement for better communications. The soldiers found about ten Soviet civilians hiding in the basement. They were not relieved, and not significantly reinforced, for two months, with the defense lasting around 60 days. The building was labelled &quot;Festung&quot; (&quot;Fortress&quot;) on German maps. Pavlov was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title for his actions. General Chuikov took note of the brutal efficiency of the defense of &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s House&quot;, stating that &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s small group of men, defending one house, killed more enemy soldiers than the Germans lost in taking Paris&quot;.
&quot;Generalmajor&quot; Hans Doerr stated about the conditions of the battle that:

Stubborn defenses of semi-fortified buildings in the center of the city cost the Germans countless soldiers. A violent battle occurred for the Univermag department store on Red Square, which served as the headquarters of the 1st Battalion of the 13th Guards Rifle Division&#x27;s 42nd Guards Rifle Regiment. Another battle occurred for a nearby warehouse dubbed the &quot;nail factory&quot;. In a three-story building close by, guardsmen fought on for five days, their noses and throats filled with brick dust from pulverized walls, with only six out of close to half a battalion escaping alive.

The Germans made slow but steady progress through the city. Positions were taken individually, but the Germans were never able to capture the key crossing points along the river bank. By 27 September, the Germans occupied the southern portion of the city, but the Soviets held the centre and northern part. Most importantly, the Soviets controlled the ferries to their supplies on the east bank of the Volga.

===Fighting in the industrial district===
After 27 September, much of the fighting in the city shifted north to the industrial district. Having slowly advanced over 10 days against strong Soviet resistance, the 51st Army Corps was finally in front of the three giant factories of Stalingrad: the Red October Steel Factory, the Barrikady Arms Factory and Stalingrad Tractor Factory. It took a few more days for them to prepare for the most savage offensive of all, which was unleashed on 14 October, which Chuikov considered to be the worst day of the battle. Exceptionally intense shelling and bombing paved the way for the first German assault groups. The main attack (led by the 14th Panzer and 305th Infantry Divisions) attacked towards the tractor factory, while another assault led by the 24th Panzer Division hit to the south of the giant plant.

Werth points out the difficulties the Siberian Division faced, as throughout the course of an entire month, German forces launched 117 assaults at the division&#x27;s regiments, and on one day they launched 23 attacks. Every trench, pillbox, rifle-pit and ruin in the area was turned into a strongpoint with its own direction and system of communications.

According to Beevor, &quot;The Red October complex and Barrikady gun factory had been turned into fortresses as lethal as those of Verdun. If anything, they were more dangerous because the Soviet regiments were so well hidden.&quot; The danger of the Barrikady Arms Factory was made apparent firsthand by German sergeant Ernst Wohlfahrt, who witnessed 18 German pioneers get killed by a Russian booby trap. The fighting for the Barrikady has been described as some of the most brutal and ferocious fighting ever, with it being stated that the &quot;battlefield east of the Barrikady blazed with the most violent and profligate clash the world would ever see&quot; and that in regard to hand-to-hand fighting, &quot;nowhere was it more brutal, more savage, more relentless, than in the Barrikady&quot;.

The German onslaught crushed the 37th Guards Rifle Division of Major General Viktor Zholudev and in the afternoon the forward assault group reached the tractor factory before arriving at the Volga River, splitting the 62nd Army into two. In response to the German breakthrough to the Volga, the front headquarters committed three battalions from the 300th Rifle Division and the 45th Rifle Division of Colonel Vasily Sokolov, a substantial force of over 2,000 men, to the fighting at the Red October Factory.

According to Werth:Fighting raged inside the Barrikady Factory until the end of October. The Soviet-controlled area shrank down to a few strips of land along the western bank of the Volga, and in November the fighting concentrated around what Soviet newspapers referred to as &quot;Lyudnikov&#x27;s Island&quot;, a small patch of ground behind the Barrikady Factory where the remnants of Colonel Ivan Lyudnikov&#x27;s 138th Rifle Division resisted all ferocious assaults thrown by the Germans and became a symbol of the stout Soviet defence of Stalingrad.

In the north of Stalingrad, by early November, the 16th Panzer Division referred to the Rynok-Spartanovka region as &quot;little Verdun&quot; because &quot;there was hardly a square meter that had not been churned up by bombs and shells.&quot;

===Air attacks===

From 5 to 12 September, &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; conducted 7,507 sorties (938 per day). From 16 to 25 September, it carried out 9,746 missions (975 per day). Determined to crush Soviet resistance, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4&#x27;s &quot;Stukawaffe&quot; flew 900 individual sorties against Soviet positions at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory on 5 October. Several Soviet regiments were wiped out; the entire staff of the Soviet 339th Infantry Regiment was killed the following morning during an air raid.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; retained air superiority into November, and Soviet daytime aerial resistance was nonexistent. However, the combination of constant air support operations on the German side and the Soviet surrender of the daytime skies began to affect the strategic balance in the air. From 28 June to 20 September, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4&#x27;s original strength of 1,600 aircraft, of which 1,155 were operational, fell to 950, of which only 550 were operational. The fleet&#x27;s total strength decreased by 40 percent. Daily sorties decreased from 1,343 per day to 975 per day. Soviet offensives in the central and northern portions of the Eastern Front tied down &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; reserves and newly built aircraft, reducing &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4&#x27;s percentage of Eastern Front aircraft from 60 percent on 28 June to 38 percent by 20 September. The &quot;Kampfwaffe&quot; (bomber force) was the hardest hit, having only 232 out of an original force of 480 left.

In mid-October, after receiving reinforcements from the Caucasus theatre, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; intensified its efforts against the remaining Red Army positions holding the west bank. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4 flew 1,250 sorties on 14 October and its Stukas dropped 550 tonnes of bombs, while German infantry surrounded the three factories. &quot;Stukageschwader&quot; 1, 2, and 77 had largely silenced Soviet artillery on the eastern bank of the Volga before turning their attention to the shipping that was once again trying to reinforce the narrowing Soviet pockets of resistance. The 62nd Army had been cut in two and, due to intensive air attack on its supply ferries, was receiving much less material support. With the Soviets forced into a strip of land on the western bank of the Volga, over 1,208 &quot;Stuka&quot; missions were flown in an effort to eliminate them.

The Soviet bomber force, the &quot;Aviatsiya Dal&#x27;nego Deystviya&quot; (Long Range Aviation; ADD), having taken crippling losses over the past 18 months, was restricted to flying at night. The Soviets flew 11,317 night sorties over Stalingrad and the Don-bend sector between 17 July and 19 November. These raids caused little damage and were of nuisance value only.

As historian Chris Bellamy notes, the Germans paid a high strategic price for the aircraft sent into Stalingrad: the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was forced to divert much of its air strength away from the oil-rich Caucasus, which had been Hitler&#x27;s original grand-strategic objective.

The Royal Romanian Air Force was also involved in the Axis air operations at Stalingrad. Starting 23 October 1942, Romanian pilots flew a total of 4,000 sorties, during which they destroyed 61 Soviet aircraft. The Romanian Air Force lost 79 aircraft, most of them captured on the ground along with their airfields.

===Germans reach the Volga===
In August 1942 after three months of slow advance, the Germans finally reached the river banks, capturing 90% of the ruined city and splitting the remaining Soviet forces into two narrow pockets. Ice floes on the Volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the Soviet defenders. Nevertheless, the fighting continued, especially on the slopes of Mamayev Kurgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city. From 21 August to 20 November, the German 6th Army lost 60,548 men, including 12,782 killed, 45,545 wounded and 2,221 missing. Fighting for the Volga banks has been noted as the &quot;most concentrated and ferocious fighting in perhaps the whole war&quot;.

==Soviet counter-offensives==
Recognising that German troops were ill-prepared for offensive operations during the winter of 1942 and that most of them were deployed elsewhere on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the Stavka decided to conduct a number of offensive operations between 19 November 1942 and 2 February 1943. These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942–1943 (19 November 1942 – 3 March 1943), which involved some fifteen Armies operating on several fronts. As per Zhukov, &quot;German operational blunders were aggravated by poor intelligence: they failed to spot preparations for the major counter-offensive near Stalingrad where there were 10 field, 1 tank and 4 air armies.&quot;

===Weakness on the Axis flanks===

During the siege, the German and allied Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian armies protecting Army Group B&#x27;s north and south flanks had pressed their headquarters for support. The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and Voronezh. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where stretches were being defended by a single platoon (platoons typically have around 20 to 50 men). These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons. Zhukov states, &quot;Compared with the Germans, the troops of the satellites were not so well armed, less experienced and less efficient, even in defence.&quot;

Because of the total focus on the city, the Axis forces had neglected for months to consolidate their positions along the natural defensive line of the Don River. The Soviet forces were allowed to retain bridgeheads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These bridgeheads in retrospect presented a serious threat to Army Group B.

Similarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector, the front southwest of Kotelnikovo was held only by the Romanian 4th Army. Beyond that army, a single German division, the 16th Motorised Infantry, covered 400 km. Paulus had requested permission on 10 November to &quot;withdraw the 6th Army behind the Don,&quot; but was rejected. According to Paulus&#x27;s comments to his adjutant Wilhelm Adam, &quot;There is still the order whereby no commander of an army group or an army has the right to relinquish a village, even a trench, without Hitler&#x27;s consent.&quot;

===Operation Uranus===

In autumn, Zhukov and Vasilevsky, responsible for strategic planning in the Stalingrad area, concentrated forces in the steppes to the north and south of the city. The northern flank was defended by Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes. The natural line of defence, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side. The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons. The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.

During the preparations for the attack, Marshal Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organisation, insisted on a one-week delay in the start date of the planned attack. The operation was code-named &quot;Uranus&quot; and launched in conjunction with Operation Mars, which was directed at Army Group Center about to the northwest. The plan was similar to that used by Zhukov to achieve victory at Khalkhin Gol in 1939, where he had sprung a double envelopment and destroyed the 23rd Division of the Japanese army.

On 19 November 1942, Operation Uranus was launched. The attacking Soviet units under the command of Gen. Nikolay Vatutin consisted of three complete armies, the 1st Guards Army, 5th Tank Army and 21st Army, including a total of 18 infantry divisions, eight tank brigades, two motorised brigades, six cavalry divisions and one anti-tank brigade. The preparations for the attack were heard by the Romanians, who pushed for reinforcements, only to be refused. Romania&#x27;s 3rd Army, which protected the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was overrun, due to thin lines, and being outnumbered and poorly equipped.

On 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad against points held by the Romanian 4th Army Corps. The Romanian forces, made up primarily of infantry, were overrun by large numbers of tanks. The Soviet forces raced west and met on 23 November at the town of Kalach, sealing the ring around Stalingrad.

==Sixth Army surrounded==


By the time of the encirclement, approximately 330,000 Axis personnel, including Germans, Romanians, Italians, and Croatians, were trapped. Among them were between 40,000 and 65,000 &quot;Hilfswillige&quot; (&quot;Hiwi&quot;), or &quot;volunteer auxiliaries,&quot; recruited from Soviet POWs and civilians. These &quot;Hiwi&quot; often served in supporting roles but were also deployed in frontline units due to their growing numbers.

The conditions within the German 6th Army deteriorated to those reminiscent of World War I trench warfare. Troops were forced to take up positions in the open steppe, lacking basic sanitation, which led to rapid spread of infections and dysentery, further debilitating the soldiers. By 19 November 1942, the German forces in the pocket numbered about 210,000, with 50,000 soldiers outside the encirclement. Of those trapped, 10,000 continued to fight, 105,000 eventually surrendered, 35,000 were evacuated by air, and 60,000 died.

Despite the 6th Army&#x27;s dire situation, no reinforcements were pulled from Army Group A in the Caucasus to aid in the relief of Stalingrad. It was only after Soviet forces broke through in Operation Little Saturn, threatening to encircle Army Group A, that a withdrawal was ordered on December 31 to avoid complete entrapment.

Army Group Don was established under Field Marshal von Manstein, tasked with leading the 20 German and two Romanian divisions encircled at Stalingrad. Despite Manstein&#x27;s recommendation for a breakout, Hitler insisted on holding the city, relying on an ill-fated airlift to supply the 6th Army, which failed to deliver the necessary supplies. The airlift fell drastically short, delivering only 105 tons per day, far below the required 750 tons. The situation worsened after the Soviets captured Tatsinskaya Airfield on 24 December, forcing the Germans to relocate their air operations to more distant and less effective bases. As supplies dwindled, starvation and disease ravaged the 6th Army. By the time the airlift was terminated, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had lost nearly 500 aircraft, including 266 Ju 52s, and failed to maintain adequate supply levels. Ultimately, the failure to relieve Stalingrad sealed the fate of the 6th Army, leading to one of the most catastrophic defeats in military history.

==End of the battle==

===Operation Winter Storm===

Manstein&#x27;s plan to rescue the Sixth Army – Operation Winter Storm – was developed in full consultation with Führer headquarters. It aimed to break through to the Sixth Army and establish a corridor to keep it supplied and reinforced, so that, according to Hitler&#x27;s order, it could maintain its &quot;cornerstone&quot; position on the Volga, &quot;with regard to operations in 1943&quot;. Manstein, however, who knew that Sixth Army could not survive the winter there, instructed his headquarters to draw up a further plan in the event of Hitler&#x27;s seeing sense.

This would include the subsequent breakout of Sixth Army, in the event of a successful first phase, and its physical reincorporation in Army Group Don. This second plan was given the name Operation Thunderclap. Winter Storm, as Zhukov had predicted, was originally planned as a two-pronged attack. One thrust would come from the area of Kotelnikovo, well to the south, and around from the Sixth Army. The other would start from the Chir front west of the Don, which was little more than from the edge of the Kessel, but the continuing attacks of Romanenko&#x27;s 5th Tank Army against the German detachments along the river Chir ruled out that start-line.

This left only the LVII Panzer Corps around Kotelnikovo, supported by the rest of Hoth&#x27;s very mixed Fourth Panzer Army, to relieve Paulus&#x27;s trapped divisions. The LVII Panzer Corps, commanded by General Friedrich Kirchner, had been weak at first. It consisted of two Romanian cavalry divisions and the 23rd Panzer Division, which mustered no more than thirty serviceable tanks. The 6th Panzer Division, arriving from France, was a vastly more powerful formation, but its members hardly received an encouraging impression. The Austrian divisional commander, General Erhard Raus, was summoned to Manstein&#x27;s royal carriage in Kharkov station on 24 November, where the field marshal briefed him. &quot;He described the situation in very sombre terms&quot;, recorded Raus.

Three days later, when the first trainload of Raus&#x27;s division steamed into Kotelnikovo station to unload, his troops were greeted by &quot;a hail of shells&quot; from Soviet batteries. &quot;As quick as lightning, the Panzergrenadiers jumped from their wagons. But already the enemy was attacking the station with their battle-cries of &#x27;Urrah!&#x27;&quot;

By 18 December, the German Army had pushed to within 48 km (30 mi) of Sixth Army&#x27;s positions. However, the predictable nature of the relief operation brought significant risk for all German forces in the area. The starving encircled forces at Stalingrad made no attempt to break out or link up with Manstein&#x27;s advance. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler&#x27;s orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, concerned about the Red Army attacks on the flank of Army Group Don and Army Group B in their advance on Rostov-on-Don, &quot;an early abandonment&quot; of Stalingrad &quot;would result in the destruction of Army Group A in the Caucasus&quot;, and the fact that his 6th Army tanks only had fuel for a 30 km advance towards Hoth&#x27;s spearhead, a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of resupply by air. Of his questions to Army Group Don, Paulus was told, &quot;Wait, implement Operation &#x27;Thunderclap&#x27; only on explicit orders!&quot; – Operation Thunderclap being the code word initiating the breakout.

===Operation Little Saturn===

On 16 December, the Soviets launched Operation Little Saturn, which attempted to punch through the Axis army (mainly Italians) on the Don. The Germans set up a &quot;mobile defence&quot; of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armour arrived. From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions – supported by at least 100 tanks – attacked the Italian Cosseria and Ravenna Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders, but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines.

The fighting forced a total revaluation of the German situation. Sensing that this was the last chance for a breakout, Manstein pleaded with Hitler on 18 December, but Hitler refused. Paulus himself also doubted the feasibility of such a breakout. The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus. The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions. But in its defensive position on the Volga, the 6th Army continued to tie down a significant number of Soviet Armies.

On 23 December, the attempt to relieve Stalingrad was abandoned and Manstein&#x27;s forces switched over to the defensive to deal with new Soviet offensives. As Zhukov states, 

===Soviet victory===

The Red Army High Command sent three envoys while, simultaneously, aircraft and loudspeakers announced the terms of capitulation on 7 January 1943. The letter was signed by Colonel-General of Artillery Voronov and the commander-in-chief of the Don Front, Lieutenant-General Rokossovsky. A low-level Soviet envoy party (comprising Major Aleksandr Smyslov, Captain Nikolay Dyatlenko and a trumpeter) carried generous surrender terms to Paulus: if he surrendered within 24 hours, he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners, medical care for the sick and wounded, prisoners being allowed to keep their personal belongings, &quot;normal&quot; food rations, and repatriation to any country they wished after the war. Rokossovsky&#x27;s letter also stressed that Paulus&#x27; men were in an untenable situation. Paulus requested permission to surrender, but Hitler rejected Paulus&#x27; request out of hand. Accordingly, Paulus did not respond. The German High Command informed Paulus, &quot;Every day that the army holds out longer helps the whole front and draws away the Russian divisions from it.&quot;

The operation launched on 10 January 1943 with what was the single largest bombardment of the war at that point, with nearly 7,000 field guns, launchers and mortars firing against German positions. The operation was likely the largest scale economy-of-force offensive conducted in military history. The Germans retreated from the suburbs of Stalingrad to the city. The loss of the two airfields, Pitomnik on 16 January 1943 and Gumrak on the night of 21/22 January, meant an end to air supplies and the evacuation of the wounded. The third and last serviceable runway was at the Stalingradskaya flight school, which had its last landings and takeoffs on 23 January. After 23 January, there were no more reported landings, just intermittent air drops of ammunition and food until the end.

Despite the horrendous situation that German forces faced, both starving and running out of ammunition, they continued to resist, with transcripts showing that despite many German soldiers yelling &quot;Hitler kaput&quot; to avoid being shot while surrendering, the level of armed resistance remained extraordinarily high till the end of the battle. In particular, the so-called &quot;HiWis&quot;, Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. Bloody urban warfare began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defence of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown.

On 22 January, Rokossovsky once again offered Paulus a chance to surrender. Paulus requested that he be granted permission to accept the terms. He told Hitler that he was no longer able to command his men, who were without ammunition or food. Hitler rejected it on a point of honour. He telegraphed the 6th Army later that day, claiming that it had made a historic contribution to the greatest struggle in German history and that it should stand fast &quot;to the last soldier and the last bullet&quot;. Hitler told Goebbels that the plight of the 6th Army was a &quot;heroic drama of German history&quot;. On 24 January, in his radio report to Hitler, Paulus reported: &quot;18,000 wounded without the slightest aid of bandages and medicines.&quot;

On 26 January 1943, the German forces inside Stalingrad were split into two pockets north and south of Mamayev-Kurgan. The northern pocket consisting of the VIIIth Corps, under General Walter Heitz, and the XIth Corps, was now cut off from telephone communication with Paulus in the southern pocket. Now &quot;each part of the cauldron came personally under Hitler&quot;. On 28 January, the cauldron was split into three parts. The northern cauldron consisted of the XIth Corps, the central with the VIIIth and LIst Corps, and the southern with the XIVth Panzer Corps and IVth Corps &quot;without units&quot;. The sick and wounded reached 40,000 to 50,000.

On 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of Hitler&#x27;s coming to power, Goebbels read out a proclamation that included the sentence: &quot;The heroic struggle of our soldiers on the Volga should be a warning for everybody to do the utmost for the struggle for Germany&#x27;s freedom and the future of our people, and thus in a wider sense for the maintenance of our entire continent.&quot; The same day, Hermann Göring broadcast from the air ministry, comparing the situation of the surrounded German 6th Army to that of the Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae, the speech was not well received by soldiers however. Paulus notified Hitler that his men would likely collapse before the day was out. In response, Hitler then issued a tranche of field promotions to the Sixth Army&#x27;s officers, with Paulus made a &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;. In deciding to promote Paulus, Hitler noted that there was no record of a German or Prussian field marshal having ever surrendered. The implication was clear: if Paulus surrendered, he would shame himself and would become the highest-ranking German officer ever to be captured. As a result, Hitler believed that Paulus would either fight to the last man or commit suicide.

On the next day, the southern pocket in Stalingrad collapsed. Soviet forces reached the entrance to the German headquarters in the ruined GUM department store. Major Anatoly Soldatov described the conditions of the department store basement as such, &quot;it was unbelievably filthy, you couldn&#x27;t get through the front or back doors, the filth came up to your chest, along with human waste and who knows what else. The stench was unbelievable.&quot; When interrogated by the Soviets, Paulus claimed that he had not surrendered. He said that he had been taken by surprise. He denied that he was the commander of the remaining northern pocket in Stalingrad and refused to issue an order in his name for them to surrender.

The central pocket, under the command of Heitz, surrendered the same day, while the northern pocket, under the command of General Karl Strecker, held out for two more days. Four Soviet armies were deployed against the northern pocket. At four in the morning on 2 February, Strecker was informed that one of his own officers had gone to the Soviets to negotiate surrender terms. Seeing no point in continuing, he sent a radio message saying that his command had done its duty and fought to the last man. When Strecker finally surrendered, he and his chief of staff, Helmuth Groscurth, drafted the final signal sent from Stalingrad, purposely omitting the customary exclamation to Hitler, replacing it with &quot;Long live Germany!&quot;

Around 91,000 exhausted, ill, wounded, and starving prisoners were taken. The prisoners included 22 generals. Hitler was furious and confided that Paulus &quot;could have freed himself from all sorrow and ascended into eternity and national immortality, but he prefers to go to Moscow&quot;.

==Tactics and battle conditions==
German military doctrine was based on the principle of combined-arms teams and close cooperation between tanks, infantry, engineers, artillery and ground-attack aircraft. To negate the German usage of tanks and artillery in the ruins of the city, Soviet commander Chuikov introduced a tactic he described as &quot;hugging&quot; the enemy: keeping Soviet front-line positions as close as possible to those of the Germans, so German artillery and aircraft could not attack without risking friendly fire. After mid-September, to reduce casualties, he ceased launching organized daylight counterattacks, instead emphasizing small unit tactics in which infantry moved through the city&#x27;s sewers to strike into the rear of attacking German units. The Soviets preferred night attacks, which disrupted German morale by depriving them of sleep. Soviet reconnaissance patrols were used to find German positions and take prisoners for interrogation, enabling them to anticipate attacks. When Soviet troops detected a coming attack, they launched their own counterattacks at dawn before German air support could arrive. Soviet troops blunted the German attacks themselves through ambushes that separated tanks from their supporting infantry, as well as the employment of booby traps and mines. These tactical innovations became widespread.

The Soviets used the great amount of destruction to their advantage, by adding man-made defenses such as barbed wire, minefields, trenches, and bunkers to the rubble, while large factories even housed tanks and large-caliber guns within. &quot;Red Army soldiers enjoyed inventing gadgets to kill Germans. New booby traps were dreamed up, each seemingly more ingenious and unpredictable in its results than the last.&quot; The battle saw all types of &quot;MOUT&quot; combat techniques at the time.

The forces involved in the battle were composed of well-trained, and in some cases, very-experienced troops, with the German 6th Army highly regarded, as it is noted that &quot;Stalingrad was fought and lost by the finest collection of divisions in an army that had not known strategic defeat for a quarter of a century&quot; in reference to German forces.

Stalingrad was the supreme example of &quot;total war&quot;, described as &quot;approaching Clausewitz&#x27;s theoretical description of absolute war&quot;. The Soviets persisted against German forces by using all available means, with the commitment being reflected in their planning, orders and actions. Stalin’s commitment to Stalingrad became total, using every available resource to hold it, and ordering the city be held at all costs. Evidence of commitment was the vast casualties the Soviets were willing to sustain. Collateral damage was not a major concern, the first priority was victory and all weapons would be used to that end with little regard for collateral damage. This is also reflected by a common saying among the Soviet defenders, who often exclaimed that &quot;for us, there is no land beyond the Volga&quot;. Total war was reflected by Axis forces, as they attacked without concern and committed to a bombing campaign which utterly destroyed the city and killed thousands of civilians, and Hitler would not allow for German forces to retreat, even with the threat of encirclement. On 14 October, Hitler suspended all operations along the entire Eastern Front except for Stalingrad, and continued pushing even harder for Army Group B to capture the city, showing his willingness to capture it at all costs.

An important weapon was the flamethrower, which was &quot;effectively terrifying&quot; in its use of clearing sewer tunnels, cellars, and inaccessible hiding places. Operators were immediately targeted as soon as they were spotted. The Katyusha rocket launcher, known to the Germans as &quot;Stalin&#x27;s organ&quot;, was used with devastating effect. In hand-to-hand fighting, spades were used as axes. Equipment used during the battle represented a full spectrum of World War II equipment, encompassing manufactured and field-improvised systems, as both sides fielded and used their complete arsenals.

The battle consumed a tremendous amount of ammunition and resources, in September fighting alone, the 6th Army expended 25 million rounds of small arms, 500,000 anti-tank rounds, 752,000 artillery shells and 178,000 hand grenades, with German forces expending 300 to 500 tons of artillery ammunition each day. The Red Army fired more ammunition in this battle than any other operation of the war.

The Soviet urban warfare tactics relied on 20-to-50-man-assault groups, armed with machine guns, grenades and satchel charges, with buildings fortified as strongpoints with clear fields of fire. Strongpoints were defended by guns or tanks on the ground floor, while machine gunners and artillery observers operated from the upper floors. Assault groups used sewers or broke through walls into adjoining buildings, to maintain concealment while moving into the rear of German attacks. Soviet tactical innovations were a &quot;combination of intelligence, discipline, and determination&quot; enabling the Soviet defenders to keep fighting when the Germans had achieved victory by &quot;all conventional measures.&quot;

The battle was notable for hand-to-hand combat, the &quot;most savage hand-to-hand battle in human memory&quot;. Ferocious fighting raged for ruins, streets, factories, houses, basements, and staircases. Blocks and buildings would change hands numerous times through intense hand-to-hand fighting. Combat was so close at times that soldiers preferred using melee weapons, such as knives, and grenades being tossed in such short distances they could be thrown back before they exploded. &quot;Every building had to be fought for; single buildings and single blocks became major military objectives. Often both German and Russian troops occupied parts of the same building.&quot; Even the sewers saw firefights. The Germans called this unseen urban warfare &quot;Rat War&quot;. Buildings had to be cleared room by room through the bombed-out debris of residential areas, office blocks, basements and apartment high-rises. Antony Beevor describes how this process was particularly brutal, &quot;In its way, the fighting in Stalingrad was even more terrifying than the impersonal slaughter at Verdun...It possessed a savage intimacy which appalled their generals, who felt that they were rapidly losing control over events.&quot; According to Peter Calvocoressi and Guy Wint, &quot;The closest and bloodiest battle of the war was fought among the stumps of buildings burnt or burning&quot;. Buildings saw floor-by-floor, close combat, with the Germans and Soviets on alternate levels, firing at each other through holes in the floors. Fighting on and around Mamayev Kurgan, a prominent hill above the city, was particularly merciless; indeed, the position changed hands many times. A notable building brutally fought for was Gerhardt&#x27;s Mill, still kept as a memorial. It was eventually cleared by the 39th Guards Regiment in close-quarters combat. Another example was on 14 September, the main railway station changed hands five times, and over the course of the next three days, another thirteen times. 

The brutality was shown by the military casualties taken by units. The 13th Guards Rifle Division suffered 30% casualties in the first twenty-four hours, with only 320 men out of 10,000 remaining at the battle&#x27;s conclusion. With buildings and floors changing hands dozens of times and taking up days to win, platoons and companies took up to 90% and even 100% casualties to win a building or floor within it. Chuikov estimated that about three thousand Germans had been killed during the fighting for the tractor factory on 14 October alone.

The Germans used aircraft, tanks and heavy artillery to clear the city with varying success. Towards the end of August, the gigantic railroad gun nicknamed &quot;Dora&quot; was brought in, being withdrawn soon after due to Soviet threats to the gun. Germans would shell Soviet reinforcements coming across the Volga without pause, with the Soviets firing back. Despite the notion of the vulnerability of tanks in urban settings, tank warfare was important, and the basis of every Soviet position was anti-tank warfare, with significant efforts made to resist German tank assaults. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; conducted 100,000 sorties and dropped 100,000 tons of bombs on the city and river crossings.

The battle epitomized the use of snipers in urban warfare. Snipers on both sides used the ruins to inflict casualties, with Soviet command heavily emphasizing sniper tactics to wear down the Germans. The most famous Soviet sniper was Vasily Zaytsev, who became a propaganda hero, credited with 225 kills. Targets were often soldiers bringing up food or water to forward positions. Artillery spotters were an especially prized target for snipers.

The ferocious and intense fighting was not only within the city itself. Most brutal fighting that consumed both forces occurred outside and west of the city, in the snow-covered steppes. The battle turned from the mobile warfare during the German push towards the city into positional warfare, with trench warfare becoming common inside and outside the city, as both sides entrenched themselves and built up positions, with trenches being turned into strongpoints and brutally fought for.

A historical debate concerns the degree of terror in the Red Army. Beevor noted the &quot;sinister&quot; message from the Stalingrad Front&#x27;s Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: &quot;The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower&quot; as an example of the coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (renamed SMERSH). On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers, and argued terror alone cannot explain such self-sacrifice. A Soviet officer interviewed, explained the feeling, &quot;There was this sense that every soldier and officer in Stalingrad was itching to kill as many Germans as possible. In Stalingrad people felt a particularly intense hatred for the Germans.&quot; German observers were perplexed by the relentlessness of the Soviets, with a 29 October 1942 article in the SS newspaper, &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot;, stating &quot;The Bolshevists attack until total exhaustion, and defend themselves until the physical extermination of the last man and weapon . . . Sometimes the individual will fight beyond the point considered humanly possible&quot;. One example of the heroism seen in Soviet troops was Soviet marine Mikhail Panikakha, who was covered in flames after his Molotov cocktail was shot while attempting to throw it, however he continued with another Molotov and destroyed a tank.

Richard Overy addresses the question of how important the Red Army&#x27;s coercive methods were to the war effort compared with other factors such as hatred for the enemy, stating that while it is &quot;easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the Soviet army fought because it was forced to fight,&quot; to concentrate solely on coercion is nonetheless to &quot;distort our view of the Soviet war effort.&quot; After conducting interviews with Soviet veterans on the terror on the Eastern Front – and specifically Order No. 227 (&quot;Not a step back!&quot;) – Catherine Merridale notes, seemingly paradoxically, &quot;their response was frequently relief.&quot; Infantryman Lev Lvovich&#x27;s explanation is typical, &quot;[i]t was a necessary and important step. We all knew where we stood after we had heard it. And we all – it&#x27;s true – felt better. Yes, we felt better.&quot;

Many women fought on the Soviet side or were under fire. As General Chuikov acknowledged, &quot;Remembering the defence of Stalingrad, I can&#x27;t overlook the very important question … about the role of women in war, in the rear, but also at the front. Equally with men they bore all the burdens of combat life and together with us men, they went all the way to Berlin.&quot; At the beginning of the battle there were 75,000 women and girls from the Stalingrad area who had finished military or medical training, and they were to serve in the battle. Women staffed many anti-aircraft batteries that fought the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and German tanks. Soviet nurses not only treated wounded personnel under fire but were involved in the dangerous work of bringing wounded soldiers back to hospitals under fire. Many Soviet wireless and telephone operators were women who often suffered heavy casualties when their command posts came under fire. Though women were not usually trained as infantry, many Soviet women fought as machine gunners, mortar operators, scouts, and as snipers. Three air regiments at Stalingrad were entirely female. At least three women won the Hero of the Soviet Union while driving tanks.

For Stalin and Hitler, Stalingrad became a matter of prestige beyond its strategic significance. A book analyzing urban warfare remarked that &quot;Among the cases collected here, the most extreme example of politics and sentiment investing a city with importance is that of Stalingrad&quot;. Another paper notes &quot;the battle between German and Soviet forces at Stalingrad was representative of the battle of wills between Hitler and Stalin&quot;. The strain on military commanders was immense: Paulus developed an uncontrollable tic in his eye, which eventually affected the left side of his face, while Chuikov experienced an outbreak of eczema that required him to have his hands completely bandaged. Troops on both sides faced the constant strain of close-range combat.

The Soviets used psychological warfare tactics to intimidate and demoralize. On loudspeakers throughout the ruined city, it was continuously announced that &quot;Every seven seconds a German soldier dies in Russia. Stalingrad. . .mass grave&quot;. The sound was interspersed with the monotonous sound of a ticking clock, and an orchestral melody dubbed the &quot;Tango of Death&quot;.

===Medical and food conditions===
The conditions of both armies were atrocious. Disease ran rampant, with many deaths due to dysentery, typhus, diphtheria, tuberculosis and jaundice, causing medical staff to fear a possible epidemic. Rats and mice were plentiful, serving as one reason Germans could not counterattack in time, due to mice having chewed their tank wiring. Lice were heavily prevalent, and plagues of flies would gather around kitchens, adding to the possibility of wound infections. Brutal winter conditions affected soldiers tremendously, with temperatures at times reaching as low as −40 °C in the second half of November, and −30 °C in late January. The weather conditions were considered to be extreme and the worst possible. The weather conditions caused rapid frostbite, with many cases of gangrene and amputation. The conditions saw soldiers dying en masse due to frostbite and hypothermia. Both armies suffered food shortages, with mass starvation on both sides. Stress, tiredness and the cold upset the metabolism of soldiers, receiving a reduced amount of calories from food. German forces eventually ran out of medical supplies such as ether, antiseptics and bandages. Surgery had to be done without anaesthesia.

Biologist Kenneth Alibek suggested the Red Army used tularemia as a biological weapon during the battle, though this is thought to have resulted from natural causes.

==Casualties==

The Axis suffered 800,000–1,500,000 casualties (killed, wounded or captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and their allies:
* 282,606 in the 6th Army from 21 August to the end of the battle; 17,293 in the 4th Panzer Army from 21 August to 31 January; 55,260 in the Army Group Don from 1 December 1942 to the end of the battle (12,727 killed, 37,627 wounded and 4,906 missing) Walsh estimates the losses to 6th Army and 4th Panzer division were over 300,000; while Louis A. DiMarco estimated the Germans suffered 400,000 total casualties during the battle. Soviet officials recovered 250,000 German and Romanian corpses in and around Stalingrad.
* According to Peter H. Wilson: German forces suffered 800,000 casualties, including the Romanians.
* According to the multivolume “The Great Patriotic War 1941-1945”: Germany and its allies suffered up to 1.5 million casualties for the entire battle, in the Don, Volga and Stalingrad areas. The figure of 1.5 million total Axis casualties was also stated by Geoffrey Jukes in 1968. This has been cited as an overestimate however.
* According to G. G. Matishov, et al.: Germany and its allies suffered more than 880,000 casualties from November 1942 to early February 1943 between Stalingrad and the &quot;great bend of the Don&quot;.
* According to Frieser, et al.: 109,000 Romanians casualties (from November 1942 to December 1942), included 70,000 captured or missing. 114,000 Italians and 105,000 Hungarians were killed, wounded or captured (from December 1942 to February 1943).
* According to Stephen Walsh: Romanian casualties were 158,854; 114,520 Italians (84,830 killed, missing and 29,690 wounded); and 143,000 Hungarian (80,000 killed, missing and 63,000 wounded), with total losses of Germany&#x27;s allies at 494,374. Losses among Soviet POW turncoats Hiwis range between 19,300 and 52,000.

235,000 German and allied troops in total, from all units, including Manstein&#x27;s ill-fated relief force, were captured during the battle.

It is estimated that as many as over one million soldiers and civilians combined were killed during the battle. Historian William Craig, while researching for his book, stressed the incredible death toll of the battle, stating that &quot;Most appalling was the growing realization, formed by statistics I uncovered, that the battle was the greatest military bloodbath in recorded history. Well over a million men and women died because of Stalingrad, a number far surpassing the previous records of dead at the first battle of the Somme and Verdun in 1916.&quot; Historian Edwin P. Hoyt states that &quot;In less than seven months the Stalingrad dead numbered over three million&quot;. Historian Jochen Hellbeck described the lethality of the battle as such, &quot;The battle of Stalingrad—the most ferocious and lethal battle in human history—ended on February 2. With an estimated death toll in an excess of a million, the bloodletting at Stalingrad far exceeded that of Verdun, one of the costliest battles of World War I.&quot; According to military historian Louis A. DiMarco, &quot;In terms of raw casualty numbers, the battle for Stalingrad was the single most brutal battle in history.&quot; Military historian Victor Davis Hanson affirmed that &quot;The costliest land battle in history took place at Stalingrad&quot; and that the &quot;fighting inside a besieged Stalingrad proved to be the most costly single battle of World War II. At least 1.5 million Russians and Germans died over the months of contesting the city&#x27;s rubble, comparably only to the World War I German attack on the fortress complex at Verdun.&quot; British historian Andrew Roberts stated that &quot;Superlatives are unavoidable when describing the battle of Stalingrad; it was the struggle of Gog and Magog, the merciless clash where the rules of war were discarded . . . Around 1.1 million died in the battle on both sides&quot;.

The Germans lost 900 aircraft (including 274 transports and 165 bombers used as transports), 500 tanks and 6,000 artillery pieces. A recent Soviet report states that 5,762 guns, 1,312 mortars, 12,701 heavy machine guns, 156,987 rifles, 80,438 sub-machine guns, 10,722 trucks, 744 aircraft; 1,666 tanks, 261 other armoured vehicles, 571 half-tracks and 10,679 motorcycles were captured by the Soviets.

The USSR, according to archival figures, suffered 1,129,619 total casualties; 478,741 personnel killed or missing, termed to be &quot;irrevocable&quot;, and 650,878 wounded or sick. The USSR lost 4,341 tanks destroyed or damaged, 15,728 artillery pieces and 2,769 combat aircraft. Though the losses given by Soviet officials have been met with criticism, for accuracy of Soviet losses and underreporting. Recent clarifications of data and estimates of losses state that the USSR suffered 1,347,214 total casualties, with 674,990 irrevocable losses, and 672,224 being wounded or sick, with an extension of this data to include NKVD troops and volunteer formations, the total casualties could extend to 1.36 to 1.37 million. However, the data is still questioned as being underestimated. The British historian Laurence Rees gives a figure of one million Soviet soldiers dead on the Stalingrad front.

Russian historian Boris Vadimovich Sokolov cites the memoirs of a former director of the Tsaritsyn-Stalingrad Defense Museum, who noted that over two million Soviets dead were counted before being ordered to stop, with &quot;still many months of work left&quot;. Sokolov states it as being closer to the true death toll than official statistics due to severe underreporting.

According to incomplete data from the Volgograd party archive, 42,754 people died during the course of the battle. However, research by Russian historian Tatyana Pavlova calculated there to be 710,000 inhabitants in the city on 23 August, and of that amount, 185,232 people had died by the battle&#x27;s conclusion, and including about 50,000 in the rural areas of Stalingrad, for a total of 235,232 civilians dead. Also from her research, Pavlova states that &quot;The losses of the civilian population of Stalingrad are 32.3% higher than the losses of the population of Hiroshima from the atomic bombing&quot; and that &quot;In Stalingrad, an absolute world record was set for the mass destruction of the civilian population during World War II.&quot; A 2018 study concluded that the demographic losses due to the battle ranged from 2.5 to 3 million, thereby describing it as a &quot;real demographic catastrophe&quot;.

===Luftwaffe losses===
The losses of transport planes were especially serious, as they destroyed the capacity for supply of the trapped 6th Army. The destruction of 72 aircraft when the airfield at Tatsinskaya Airfield was overrun meant the loss of about 10 percent of the Luftwaffe transport fleet.

==Aftermath==


The German public was not officially told of the impending disaster until the end of January 1943, though positive media reports had stopped in the weeks before the announcement. Stalingrad marked the first time that the Nazi government publicly acknowledged a failure in its war effort. On 31 January, regular programmes on German state radio were replaced by a broadcast of the sombre Adagio movement from Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Seventh Symphony, followed by the announcement of the defeat at Stalingrad. On 18 February, Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels gave the famous &quot;Sportpalast&quot; speech in Berlin, encouraging the Germans to accept a total war that would claim all resources and efforts from the entire population.

Based on Soviet records, over 11,000 German soldiers continued to resist in isolated groups within the city for the next month. Some have presumed that they were motivated by a belief that fighting on was better than a slow death in Soviet captivity. Historian Omer Bartov claims they were motivated by belief in Hitler and National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany. Generally, the letters expressed belief in Germany&#x27;s ultimate victory and the soldiers&#x27; willingness to fight and die at Stalingrad to achieve that victory. Bartov reported that a great many of the soldiers were well aware that they would not be able to escape from Stalingrad, but in their letters to their families stated that they were proud to &quot;sacrifice themselves for the Führer&quot;.

A Soviet officer interviewed months after the battle, Nikolai Nikitich Aksyonov, described the scale of devastation and conflict at Stalingrad, stating that &quot;As a historian, I tried to draw comparisons to battles I know from history: Borodino, Verdun during the Imperialist War, but none of that was right because the scale of conflict in Stalingrad makes it hard to compare it to anything. It seemed as if Stalingrad was breathing fire for days on end.&quot; Some German soldiers expressed in their letters that they were trapped in a &quot;second Verdun&quot;, while Soviet defenders described the battle as their &quot;Red Verdun&quot;, in which they would refuse to surrender to the enemy. German captain Wilhelm Hosenfeld wrote in early October 1942 that, &quot;The fight for Stalingrad now surpasses all our previous struggles — it has rightly been compared to Verdun. We must hope that the outcome is different. For I believe that the city holds a similar power for the Bolsheviks as Verdun did for the French in the First World War. It has become a symbol. This is a decisive moment. The French would say; Whoever holds Verdun will win the war.’ The Führer has spoken in similar fashion of Stalingrad — and the city still has not fallen to us.&quot; In October 1942, a Soviet war correspondent remarked that &quot;A city of peace has become a city of war. The laws of warfare have placed it on the front line, at the epicenter of a battle that will shape the outcome of the entire war. After sixty days of fighting the Germans now know what this means. &#x27;Verdun!&#x27; they scoff. &#x27;This is no Verdun. This is something new in the history of warfare. This is Stalingrad.&quot; The world press commonly referred to it as the &quot;Verdun on the Volga&quot; during the battle.

Historian David Glantz stated that Stalingrad was &quot;the most brutal clash of arms in the most terrible of twentieth-century wars&quot;. Further, French historian François Kersaudy stated that &quot;Stalingrad was unique in the Second World War, in terms of duration, the number of soldiers killed, the relentlessness, the significance&quot; and that &quot;It was terrifying on both sides. They both had to carry on fighting until the very end. The people present there would have preferred hell itself&quot;. Historian Andrew Roberts stated that &quot;The battle of Stalingrad is deservedly considered to be the most desperate in human history. The German Sixth Army was sucked into a house-by-house, street-by-street, factory-by-factory struggle often even more attritional than the trench warfare of the Great War.&quot;

The battle is not only infamous for being a military bloodbath, but also for its disregard for civilians by both sides. When German forces reached the hospital for mentally handicapped children in the city, they promptly shot all the ten to fourteen year old patients. Soviet sniper Vasily Zaytsev took note of atrocities that took place during the battle, stating that, &quot;another time you see young girls, children hanging from trees in the park. . .It has tremendous impact.&quot; A Soviet sergeant in the 389th Infantry Division noted that Russian women coming out of houses during the fighting for the Barrikady workers&#x27; settlement to take shelter from German firing, ended up being killed by Russian machine-gun fire. 

The bombing campaign and over five months of ferocious fighting had utterly destroyed 99% of the city, with the city being nothing more than a heap of rubble. Of the population of well over half a million before the battle, a quick census revealed only 1,515 people remained following the battle&#x27;s conclusion. However, Beevor notes that a census revealed that 9,796 civilians were in the city at the battle&#x27;s conclusion, including 994 children. 

The remaining forces continued to resist, hiding in cellars and sewers, but by early March 1943 the last small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered. According to Soviet intelligence documents shown in the documentary, a remarkable NKVD report from March 1943 is available showing the tenacity of some of these German groups:

The operative report of the Don Front&#x27;s staff issued on 5 February 1943, 22:00 said,

The condition of the troops that surrendered was pitiful. British war correspondent Alexander Werth described the following scene in his &quot;Russia at War&quot; book, based on a first-hand account of his visit to Stalingrad on 3–5 February 1943,

Most of the nearly 91,000 German prisoners captured in Stalingrad perished. Weakened by disease, starvation and lack of medical care during the encirclement, they were sent on forced marches to prisoner camps and later to labour camps all over the Soviet Union. Some 35,000 were eventually sent on transports, of which 17,000 did not survive. Most died of wounds, disease (particularly typhus), cold, overwork, mistreatment and malnutrition. Some were kept in the city to help rebuild it.

A handful of senior officers were taken to Moscow and used for propaganda purposes, and some of them joined the National Committee for a Free Germany. Some, including Paulus, signed anti-Hitler statements that were broadcast to German troops. Paulus testified for the prosecution during the Nuremberg Trials and assured families in Germany that those soldiers taken prisoner at Stalingrad were safe. He remained in the Soviet Union until 1952, then moved to Dresden in East Germany, where he spent the remainder of his days defending his actions at Stalingrad and was quoted as saying that Communism was the best hope for postwar Europe. General Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach offered to raise an anti-Hitler army from the Stalingrad survivors, but the Soviets did not accept the offer. It was not until 1955 that the last of the 5,000–6,000 survivors were repatriated (to West Germany) after a plea to the Politburo by Konrad Adenauer.

==Significance==

Stalingrad has been described as the greatest single defeat in the history of the German Army. Historian Geoffrey Roberts described it as &quot;the biggest and most traumatic defeat in German military history&quot; and that &quot;the myth of the invincible &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; was gone forever&quot;. The German military historian Walter Görlitz stated that &quot;It was a second Jena, and was certainly the greatest defeat in history that a German Army had ever undergone&quot;. The battle is commonly identified as the turning point on the Eastern Front, in the war against Germany overall, and in the entire Second World War. The battle is analyzed as being a &quot;point of no return&quot; on the Eastern Front and as the &quot;final military consequence&quot; of Germany&#x27;s decreasing chances to win the war against the Soviet Union. The Soviet general Viktor Matsulenko deemed the battle to be the &quot;beginning of a basic turning point not just in the course of the Great Patriotic War, but for the entire World War II&quot; and that the battle was the &quot;most important military-political event of World War II&quot;. The battle is also seen as the turning point in the air war, as German forces lost countless aircraft and experienced crewmen. Stalingrad gave the people of the Soviet Union hope, with military historian David Glantz asserting that &quot;Russians, as well as many of the former Soviet Union’s other ethnic minorities, saw the Red Army’s victory at Stalingrad as a catharsis which saved Stalin’s city and salvaged a nation’s shattered pride&quot;. In 1989, a comprehensive quantitative analysis concluded that Stalingrad was the military turning point of the war, the turning point for the Soviet leadership, as Stalin recognized the practicality of using his experienced commanders and gave his generals more freedom in fighting the war, and that the Soviet Union had indeed seized the initiative as a result of the battle, based on some of the critical factors examined in the study. An analysis in 2004 also concluded that the epic battle sealed the fate of the Germans in the East, a blow in which they would never recover from, and as a result the strategic initiative shifted to the Soviet side, therefore establishing the Battle of Stalingrad as the fundamental turning point in the war on the Eastern Front. A year of Axis gains from Case Blue had been wiped out. The Sixth Army of Germany had ceased to exist, and the forces of Germany&#x27;s European allies, except Finland, had been shattered. In a speech on 9 November 1944, Hitler himself blamed Stalingrad for Germany&#x27;s impending doom. Furthermore, according to some historians, such as Mikhail Myagkov, a Russian historian, the battle ended up completely dissuading Turkey and Japan from declaring war on the Soviet Union. The battle also stifled plans for future joint strategy in the Indian Ocean area between the Japanese and the Germans once their forces met up, and made certain that the German ambitions to use Soviet resources to fight against the Western Allies were no longer feasible. Its importance was further noted by historian John Erickson, who stated that &quot;If the battle of Poltava in 1709 turned Russia into a European power, then Stalingrad set the Soviet Union on the road to being a world power&quot;.

According to Roberts, &quot;Battles do change the course of history. They determine the outcome of wars, the shape and character of victory and the peace that follows. They also change how the history of a war is viewed. In both these respects no battle changed history more than Stalingrad&quot;, and that &quot;The coming of the nuclear era meant that there would never be another battle like Stalingrad. The greatest battle of the last great war of the pre-atomic age was an epic struggle that will never be surpassed.&quot; Historian J. Bradford Delong expressed that the Battle of Stalingrad, &quot;of any battle in human history, has made the greatest positive difference for humanity&quot;.

The destruction of multiple armies and the halting of Germany&#x27;s advance made the battle a watershed moment. Germany had lost its best army, as the Sixth Army was regarded as &quot;the finest and most triumphant infantry in the world at that time&quot; and was deemed to have been the &quot;invincible, unstoppable spearhead of the Third Reich&#x27;s arms&quot;. At the time, the global significance of the battle was not in doubt. A Dresden newspaper wrote in early August that the battle would become the &quot;most fateful battle of the war&quot;, and an article from the British &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in September shared similar views. Joseph Goebbels also shared similar sentiment, declaring that the battle was a &quot;question of life or death, and all of our prestige, just as that of the Soviet Union, will depend on how it will end&quot;. The Reich Ministry of Propaganda declared it to be &quot;the greatest battle of attrition the world has ever seen&quot;. On 2 February 1943, American journalist Barnet Nover wrote in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; that &quot;Stalingrad&#x27;s role in this war was that of the Battles of the Marne, Verdun and the Second Marne of the last war rolled into one&quot;. While on 3 February 1943, the &quot;New York Times&quot; heralded the destruction of &quot;the flower of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s army&quot;. The next day, on 4 February, French newspaper, &quot;La Semaine&quot;, headlined it as &quot;the greatest battle of all time&quot;. Writing in his diary on 1 January 1943, British General Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, reflected on the change in the position from a year before:

At this point, the British had won the Battle of El Alamein in November 1942. However, there were only about 50,000 German soldiers at El Alamein in Egypt, while at Stalingrad, at least 200,000 Germans had been lost. Stalingrad is viewed as being more important than both El Alamein and Operation Torch.

On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. Joseph Goebbels read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. 

The reverse was the case on the Soviet side. There was an overwhelming surge in confidence and belief in victory. A common saying was: &quot;You cannot stop an army which has done Stalingrad.&quot; Stalin was feted as the hero of the hour and made a Marshal of the Soviet Union.

The news of the battle echoed round the world, with many people now believing that Hitler&#x27;s defeat was inevitable. The Turkish Consul in Moscow predicted that &quot;the lands which the Germans have destined for their living space will become their dying space&quot;. Britain&#x27;s conservative &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; proclaimed that the victory had saved European civilisation. The country celebrated &quot;Red Army Day&quot; on 23 February 1943. A ceremonial Sword of Stalingrad was forged to the order of King George VI. After being put on public display in Britain, this was presented to Stalin by Winston Churchill at the Tehran Conference later in 1943. Soviet propaganda spared no effort and wasted no time in capitalising on the triumph, impressing a global audience. The prestige of Stalin, the Soviet Union, and the worldwide Communist movement was immense, and their political position greatly enhanced.

===Commemoration===

In recognition of the determination of its defenders, Stalingrad was awarded the title Hero City in 1945. A colossal monument called &quot;The Motherland Calls&quot; was erected in 1967 on Mamayev Kurgan, the hill overlooking the city where bones and rusty metal splinters can still be found. The statue forms part of a war memorial complex which includes the ruins of the Grain Silo and Pavlov&#x27;s House. On 2 February 2013 Volgograd hosted a military parade and other events to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the final victory. Since then, military parades have always commemorated the victory in the city.

Every year still, hundreds of bodies of soldiers who died in the battle are recovered in the area around Stalingrad and reburied in the cemeteries at Mamayev Kurgan or Rossoshka.

==In popular culture==
The events of the Battle for Stalingrad have been covered in numerous media works of British, American, German, and Russian origin, for its significance as a turning point in the Second World War and for the loss of life associated with the battle. Stalingrad has become synonymous with large-scale urban battles with immense casualties on both sides, and according to historian David Glantz, has become a &quot;metaphor for the ferocity of the Soviet-German conflict and, indeed, for the devastating nature of twentieth-century warfare as a whole&quot;. Also, historian Geoffrey Roberts states that &quot;No battle of any war has had more written about it than Stalingrad&quot; and that &quot;No battle of the Second World War has captured the public imagination as much as the clash between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany at Stalingrad in 1942... Stalingrad was an epic battle unmatched by any other in its dimensions, drama and decisiveness.&quot; In addition, besides the battle being recognized as the bloodiest and fiercest of the war, it is also considered to have been the closest of the war as well, as Geoffrey Roberts quotes the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s remark about the Battle of Waterloo as a &quot;close-run thing&quot; to describe the Battle of Stalingrad, further adding to its popularity status and notoriety.

<text>Bodhidharma was a semi-legendary Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th or 6th century CE. He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China, and is regarded as its first Chinese patriarch. He is also popularly regarded as the founder of Shaolin kung fu, an idea popularized in the 20th century, but based on the 17th century Yijin Jing and the Daoist association of &quot;daoyin&quot; gymnastics with Bodhidharma. 

Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend and unreliable details. According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions, which typically refers to Central Asia but can also include the Indian subcontinent, and is described as either a &quot;Persian Central Asian&quot; or a &quot;South Indian [...] the third son of a great Indian king.&quot; Aside from the Chinese accounts, several popular traditions also exist regarding Bodhidharma&#x27;s origins. Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as an ill-tempered, large-nosed, profusely-bearded, wide-eyed non-Chinese person. He is referred to as &quot;The Blue-Eyed Barbarian&quot; () in Chan texts.

The accounts also differ on the date of his arrival, with one early account claiming that he arrived during the Liu Song dynasty (420–479 CE) and later accounts dating his arrival to the Liang dynasty (502–557 CE). Bodhidharma was primarily active in the territory of the Northern Wei (386–534 CE). Modern scholarship dates him to about the early 5th century CE.

Bodhidharma&#x27;s teachings and practice centered on meditation and the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;. The &quot;Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall&quot; (952) identifies Bodhidharma as the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in an uninterrupted line that extends back to the Gautama Buddha himself.
==Etymology==
His name means &quot;&quot;dharma&quot; of awakening (bodhi)&quot; in Sanskrit.

== Biography ==

=== Principal sources ===
There are two known extant accounts written by contemporaries of Bodhidharma. According to these sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions, and is described as either a &quot;Persian Central Asian&quot; or a &quot;South Indian [...] the third son of a great Indian king.&quot; Later sources draw on these two sources, adding additional details, including a change to being descended from a &quot;Brahmin&quot; king, which accords with the reign of the Pallavas, who &quot;claim[ed] to belong to a brahmin lineage.&quot;

The &quot;Western Regions&quot; was a historical name specified in the Chinese chronicles between the 3rd century BCE to the 8th century CE that referred to the regions west of Yumen Pass, most often Central Asia or sometimes, more specifically, the easternmost portion of it (e.g. Altishahr or the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang). Sometimes, it was used more generally to refer to other regions to the west of China as well, such as the Indian subcontinent (as in the novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;).

==== &quot;The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang&quot; ====
The earliest text mentioning Bodhidharma is &quot;The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang&quot; ( &quot;Luòyáng Qiélánjì&quot;) which was compiled in 547 by Yang Xuanzhi (), a writer and translator of Mahayana sutras into Chinese. Yang gave the following account:
The account of Bodhidharma in the Luoyan Record does not particularly associate him with meditation, but rather depicts him as a thaumaturge capable of mystical feats. This may have played a role in his subsequent association with the martial arts and esoteric knowledge.

==== Tanlin – preface to the Two Entrances and Four Acts ====

The second account was written by Tanlin (曇林; 506–574). Tanlin&#x27;s brief biography of the &quot;Dharma Master&quot; is found in his preface to the &quot;Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices&quot;, a text traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma and the first text to identify him as South Indian:
Tanlin&#x27;s account was the first to mention that Bodhidharma attracted disciples, specifically mentioning Daoyu () and Dazu Huike (), the latter of whom would later figure very prominently in the Bodhidharma literature. Although Tanlin has traditionally been considered a disciple of Bodhidharma, it is more likely that he was a student of Huike.

==== &quot;Record of the Masters and Students of the Laṅka&quot; ====
The &quot;Record of the Masters and Students of the Laṅka&quot; (Léngqié Shīzī Jì 楞伽師資記), which survives both in Chinese and in Tibetan translation (although the surviving Tibetan translation is apparently of older provenance than the surviving Chinese version), states that Bodhidharma is not the first ancestor of Zen, but instead the second. This text instead claims that Guṇabhadra, the translator of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;, is the first ancestor in the lineage. It further states that Bodhidharma was his student. The Tibetan translation is estimated to have been made in the late eighth or early ninth century, indicating that the original Chinese text was written at some point before that.

Tanlin&#x27;s preface has also been preserved in Jingjue&#x27;s (683–750) &quot;Lengjie Shizi ji&quot; &quot;Chronicle of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; Masters&quot;, which dates from 713 to 716./ca. 715 He writes, 
==== &quot;Further Biographies of Eminent Monks&quot; ====
In the 7th-century historical work &quot;Further Biographies of Eminent Monks&quot; (續高僧傳 &quot;Xù gāosēng zhuàn&quot;), Daoxuan () possibly drew on Tanlin&#x27;s preface as a basic source, but made several significant additions:

Firstly, Daoxuan adds more detail concerning Bodhidharma&#x27;s origins, writing that he was of &quot;South Indian Brahman stock&quot; (南天竺婆羅門種 &quot;nán tiānzhú póluómén zhŏng&quot;).

Secondly, more detail is provided concerning Bodhidharma&#x27;s journeys. Tanlin&#x27;s original is imprecise about Bodhidharma&#x27;s travels, saying only that he &quot;crossed distant mountains and seas&quot; before arriving in Wei. Daoxuan&#x27;s account, however, implies &quot;a specific itinerary&quot;: &quot;He first arrived at Nan-yüeh during the Sung period. From there, he turned north and came to the Kingdom of Wei&quot; This implies that Bodhidharma had travelled to China by sea and that he had crossed over the Yangtze.

Thirdly, Daoxuan suggests a date for Bodhidharma&#x27;s arrival in China. He writes that Bodhidharma makes landfall in the time of the Song, thus making his arrival no later than the time of the Song&#x27;s fall to the Southern Qi in 479.

Finally, Daoxuan provides information concerning Bodhidharma&#x27;s death. Bodhidharma, he writes, died at the banks of the Luo River, where he was interred by his disciple Dazu Huike, possibly in a cave. According to Daoxuan&#x27;s chronology, Bodhidharma&#x27;s death must have occurred prior to 534, the date of the Northern Wei&#x27;s fall, because Dazu Huike subsequently leaves Luoyang for Ye. Furthermore, citing the shore of the Luo River as the place of death might possibly suggest that Bodhidharma died in the mass executions at Heyin () in 528. Supporting this possibility is a report in the Chinese Buddhist canon stating that a Buddhist monk was among the victims at Héyīn.

=== Later accounts ===

==== &quot;Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall&quot; ====

In the &quot;Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall&quot; (祖堂集 &quot;Zǔtángjí&quot;) of 952, the elements of the traditional Bodhidharma story are in place. Bodhidharma is said to have been a disciple of Prajñātāra, thus establishing the latter as the 27th patriarch in India. After a three-year journey, Bodhidharma reached China in 527, during the Liang (as opposed to the Song in Daoxuan&#x27;s text). The &quot;Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall&quot; includes Bodhidharma&#x27;s encounter with Emperor Wu of Liang, which was first recorded around 758 in the appendix to a text by Shenhui (), a disciple of Huineng.

Finally, as opposed to Daoxuan&#x27;s figure of &quot;over 180 years,&quot; the &quot;Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall&quot; states that Bodhidharma died at the age of 150. He was then buried on Mount Xiong&#x27;er (熊耳山), to the west of Luoyang. However, three years after the burial, in the Pamir Mountains, Song Yun ()—an official of one of the later Wei kingdoms—encountered Bodhidharma, who claimed to be returning to India and was carrying a single sandal. Bodhidharma predicted the death of Song Yun&#x27;s ruler, a prediction which was borne out upon the latter&#x27;s return. Bodhidharma&#x27;s tomb was then opened, and only a single sandal was found inside.

According to the &quot;Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall&quot;, Bodhidharma left the Liang court in 527 and relocated to Mount Song near Luoyang and the Shaolin Monastery, where he &quot;faced a wall for nine years, not speaking for the entire time&quot;, his date of death can have been no earlier than 536. Moreover, his encounter with the Wei official indicates a date of death no later than 554, three years before the fall of the Western Wei.

==== Daoyuan – Transmission of the Lamp ====
Subsequent to the &quot;Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall&quot;, the only dated addition to the biography of Bodhidharma is in the &quot;Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp&quot; (景德傳燈錄 &quot;Jĭngdé chuándēng lù&quot;, published 1004 CE), by Daoyuan (), in which it is stated that Bodhidharma&#x27;s original name had been Bodhitāra but was changed by his master Prajñātāra. The same account is given by the Japanese master Keizan&#x27;s 13th-century work of the same title.

=== Popular traditions ===
Several contemporary popular traditions also exist regarding Bodhidharma&#x27;s origins. An Indian tradition regards Bodhidharma to be the third son of a Pallava king from Kanchipuram. This is consistent with the Southeast Asian traditions which also describe Bodhidharma as a former South Indian Tamil prince who had awakened his kundalini and renounced royal life to become a monk. The Tibetan version similarly characterises him as a dark-skinned siddha from South India. Conversely, the Japanese tradition generally regards Bodhidharma as a red-haired Persian.

== Practice and teaching ==
=== Two Entrances and Four Practices ===
Bodhidharma is traditionally seen as introducing a Mahayana Buddhist practice of dhyana (meditation) in China. According to modern scholars, like the Japanese scholar of Chan Yanagida Seizan, generally hold that the &quot;Two Entrances and Four Practices&quot; &quot;(&quot;二入四行論&quot;)&quot; is the only extant work that can be attributed to Bodhidharma and as such, this is the main source for our knowledge of his teaching.

According to this text, Bodhidharma taught two &quot;entrances&quot; to the Dharma. The first is a subitist teaching that directly apprehends the ultimate principle, that is, the true nature or buddha-nature. The second entrance deals with four practices: (1) accepting all our sufferings as the fruit of past karma, (2) accept our circumstances with equanimity, (3) to be without craving, and (4) to let go of wrong thoughts and practice the six perfections.

According to Yanagida Seizan, the first &quot;entrance of principle&quot;, was a subitist teaching which derives from the sudden enlightenment thought of Tao-sheng; while the four practices are a reworking of the &quot;four foundations of mindfulness&quot;, which were popular in the late Six Dynasties period Buddhist meditation circles.

=== Wall-gazing ===

Tanlin, in the preface to &quot;Two Entrances and Four Practices&quot;, and Daoxuan, in the &quot;Further Biographies of Eminent Monks&quot;, mentions a practice of Bodhidharma&#x27;s termed &quot;wall-gazing&quot; (壁觀 &quot;bìguān&quot;). Both Tanlin and Daoxuan associate this &quot;wall-gazing&quot; with &quot;quieting [the] mind&quot; ().

In the &quot;Two Entrances and Four Practices&quot;, the term &quot;wall-gazing&quot; is given as follows:

Daoxuan states, &quot;the merits of Mahāyāna wall-gazing are the highest&quot;. These are the first mentions in the historical record of what may be a type of meditation being ascribed to Bodhidharma. Exactly what sort of practice Bodhidharma&#x27;s &quot;wall-gazing&quot; was remains uncertain. Nearly all accounts have treated it either as an undefined variety of meditation, as Daoxuan and Dumoulin, or as a variety of seated meditation akin to the zazen () that later became a defining characteristic of Chan. The latter interpretation is particularly common among those working from a Chan standpoint.

There have also, however, been interpretations of &quot;wall-gazing&quot; as a non-meditative phenomenon. Jeffrey Broughton points out that where Bodhidharma&#x27;s teachings appear in Tibetan translation among the Dunhuang manuscripts, the Chinese phrase &quot;in a coagulated state abides in wall-examining&quot; (ning chu pi-kuan) is replaced in Tibetan with &quot;rejects discrimination and &quot;abides in brightness&quot;&quot; (rtogs pa spangs te | lham mer gnas na). Broughton sees this as a curious divergence, as Tibetan translations of Chinese Chan texts are usually quite literal. He concludes that in early Tibet, &quot;wall examining&quot; did not refer to a literal practice of sitting cross-legged facing a wall.

=== The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; ===

There are early texts which explicitly associate Bodhidharma with the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;. Daoxuan, for example, in a late recension of his biography of Bodhidharma&#x27;s successor Huike, has the sūtra as a basic and important element of the teachings passed down by Bodhidharma:

Another early text, the &quot;&quot;Record of the Masters and Disciples of the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;&quot; () of Jingjue (淨覺; 683–750), also mentions Bodhidharma in relation to this text. Jingjue&#x27;s account also makes explicit mention of &quot;sitting meditation&quot; or zazen:

In other early texts, the school that would later become known as Chan Buddhism is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra school&quot; (楞伽宗 &quot;Léngqié zōng&quot;).

The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;, one of the Mahayana sutras, is a highly &quot;difficult and obscure&quot; text whose basic thrust is to emphasize &quot;the inner enlightenment that does away with all duality and is raised above all distinctions&quot;. It is among the first and most important texts for East Asian Yogācāra.

According to Suzuki, one of the recurrent emphases in the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; is a lack of reliance on words to effectively express reality:

In contrast to the ineffectiveness of words, the sūtra instead stresses the importance of the &quot;self-realization&quot; that is &quot;attained by noble wisdom&quot; and, according to Suzuki, occurs &quot;when one has an insight into reality as it is&quot;: &quot;The truth is the state of self-realization and is beyond categories of discrimination&quot;. According to Suzuki, reflecting his own emphasis on kensho, the sūtra goes on to outline the ultimate effects of an experience of self-realization:

== Legends about Bodhidharma ==
Several stories about Bodhidharma have become popular legends, which are still being used in the Ch&#x27;an, Seon, and Zen-tradition.

=== Encounter with Emperor Wu of Liang ===
The &quot;Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall&quot; says that in 527, Bodhidharma visited Emperor Wu of Liang, a fervent patron of Buddhism:
This encounter was included as the first kōan of the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;.

=== Nine years of wall-gazing ===

Failing to make a favorable impression in South China, Bodhidharma is said to have travelled to the Shaolin Monastery. After either being refused entry or being ejected after a short time, he lived in a nearby cave, where he &quot;faced a wall for nine years, not speaking for the entire time&quot;.

The biographical tradition is littered with apocryphal tales about Bodhidharma&#x27;s life and circumstances. In one version of the story, he is said to have fallen asleep seven years into his nine years of wall-gazing. Becoming angry with himself, he cut off his eyelids to prevent it from happening again. According to the legend, as his eyelids hit the floor the first tea plants sprang up, and thereafter, tea would provide a stimulant to help keep students of Chan awake during zazen.

The most popular account relates that Bodhidharma was admitted into the Shaolin temple after nine years in the cave and taught there for some time. However, other versions report that he &quot;passed away, seated upright&quot;; or that he disappeared, leaving behind the &quot;Yijin Jing&quot;; or that his legs atrophied after nine years of sitting, which is why Daruma dolls have no legs.

=== Huike cuts off his arm ===
In one legend, Bodhidharma refused to resume teaching until his would-be student, Dazu Huike, who had kept vigil for weeks in the deep snow outside of the monastery, cut off his own left arm to demonstrate sincerity.

=== Transmission ===
==== Skin, flesh, bone, marrow ====
&quot;Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp&quot; (景德传灯录) of Daoyuan, presented to the emperor in 1004, records that Bodhidharma wished to return to India and called together his disciples:

Bodhidharma passed on the symbolic robe and bowl of dharma succession to Dazu Huike and, some texts claim, a copy of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;. Bodhidharma then either returned to India or died.

=== Bodhidharma at Shaolin ===
Some Chinese myths and legends describe Bodhidharma as being disturbed by the poor physical shape of the Shaolin monks, after which, he instructed them in techniques to maintain their physical condition as well as teaching meditation. He is said to have taught a series of external exercises called the Eighteen Arhat Hands and an internal practice called the Sinew Metamorphosis Classic. In addition, after his departure from the temple, two manuscripts by Bodhidharma were said to have been discovered inside the temple: the &quot;Yijin Jing&quot; and the &quot;Xisui Jing&quot;. Copies and translations of the &quot;Yijin Jing&quot; survive to the modern day. The &quot;Xisui Jing&quot; has been lost.

=== Travels in Southeast Asia ===

According to Southeast Asian folklore, Bodhidharma travelled from Jambudvipa by sea to Palembang, Indonesia. Passing through Sumatra, Java, Bali, Malaysia, and Luzon Island, he eventually entered China through Nanyue. In his travels through the region, Bodhidharma is said to have transmitted his knowledge of the Mahayana doctrine and the martial arts. Malay legend holds that he introduced forms to silat. In Tagalog legend, Bodhidharma reached the island of Luzon in the Philippines passing through Palawan and he introduced Arnis to the locals.

Vajrayana tradition links Bodhidharma with the 11th-century south Indian monk Dampa Sangye who travelled extensively to Tibet and China spreading tantric teachings.

=== Appearance after his death ===
Three years after Bodhidharma&#x27;s death, Ambassador Song Yun of northern Wei is said to have seen him walking while holding a shoe at the Pamir Mountains. Song asked Bodhidharma where he was going, to which Bodhidharma replied, &quot;I am going home&quot;. When asked why he was holding his shoe, Bodhidharma answered, &quot;You will know when you reach Shaolin monastery. Don&#x27;t mention that you saw me or you will meet with disaster&quot;. After arriving at the palace, Song told the emperor that he met Bodhidharma on the way. The emperor said Bodhidharma was already dead and buried and had Song arrested for lying. At Shaolin Monastery, the monks informed them that Bodhidharma was dead and had been buried in a hill behind the temple. The grave was exhumed and was found to contain a single shoe. The monks then said, &quot;Master has gone back home&quot; and prostrated three times: &quot;For nine years, he had remained and nobody knew him; Carrying a shoe in hand he went home quietly, without ceremony.&quot;

== Lineage ==

=== Construction of lineages ===
The idea of a patriarchal lineage in Ch&#x27;an dates back to the epitaph for Faru (), a disciple of the 5th patriarch Hongren (). In the &quot;Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices&quot; and the &quot;Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks&quot;, Daoyu and Dazu Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.

In the 6th century, the biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre, the typical Chan lineage was developed:

According to McRae, it is not clear that the practitioners surrounding Bodhidharma and his disciple Huike considered themselves as belonging to a unified movement or group, such as a &quot;Chan school,&quot; nor did they have any sense of sharing any continuity with the later tradition. He says even the name &quot;proto-Chan&quot; is not really reflective of their activities.

D. T. Suzuki contends that Chan&#x27;s growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had &quot;no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism&quot; and that Chan historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.

=== Six patriarchs ===
The earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma into the 5th to 7th generation of patriarchs. Various records of different authors are known, which give a variation of transmission lines:
=== Continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha ===
Eventually, these descriptions of the lineage evolved into a continuous lineage from Śākyamuni Buddha to Bodhidharma. The idea of a line of descent from Śākyamuni Buddha is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of Chan Buddhism.

According to the &quot;Song of Enlightenment&quot; (證道歌 &quot;Zhèngdào gē&quot;) by Yongjia Xuanjue, Bodhidharma was the 28th Patriarch of Chan, in a line of descent from Gautama Buddha via his disciple Mahākāśyapa:
&lt;poem&gt;Mahakashyapa was the first, leading the line of transmission;
Twenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;
The Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;
And Bodhidharma became the First Father here
His mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,
And by them many minds came to see the Light.&lt;/poem&gt;
The &quot;Transmission of the Light&quot; gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission:

== Modern scholarship ==
Bodhidharma has been the subject of critical scientific research, which has shed new light on the traditional stories about Bodhidharma.

=== Biography as a hagiographic process ===
According to John McRae, Bodhidharma has been the subject of a hagiographic process which served the needs of Chan Buddhism. According to him, it is not possible to write an accurate biography of Bodhidharma:

McRae&#x27;s standpoint accords with Yanagida&#x27;s standpoint: &quot;Yanagida ascribes great historical value to the witness of the disciple Tanlin, but at the same time, acknowledges the presence of &#x27;many puzzles in the biography of Bodhidharma&#x27;&quot;. Given the present state of the sources, he considers it impossible to compile a reliable account of Bodhidharma&#x27;s life.

Several scholars have suggested that the composed image of Bodhidharma depended on the combination of supposed historical information on various historical figures over several centuries. Bodhidharma as a historical person may even never have actually existed.

=== Origins and place of birth ===
Dumoulin comments on the three principal sources. The Persian heritage is doubtful, according to Dumoulin: &quot;In the &quot;Description of the Lo-yang temple&quot;, Bodhidharma is called a Persian. Given the ambiguity of geographical references in writings of this period, such a statement should not be taken too seriously.&quot; Dumoulin considers Tanlin&#x27;s account of Bodhidharma being &quot;the third son of a great Brahman king&quot; to be a later addition, and finds the exact meaning of &quot;South Indian Brahman stock&quot; unclear: &quot;And when Daoxuan speaks of origins from South Indian Brahman stock, it is not clear whether he is referring to roots in nobility or to India in general as the land of the Brahmans.&quot;

These Chinese sources lend themselves to make inferences about Bodhidharma&#x27;s origins. &quot;The third son of a Brahman king&quot; has been speculated to mean &quot;the third son of a Pallava king&quot;. Based on a specific pronunciation of the Chinese characters 香至 as Kang-zhi, meaning &quot;fragrance extreme&quot;, Tsutomu Kambe identifies 香至 to be Kanchipuram, an old capital town in the state Tamil Nadu, India. According to Tsutomu Kambe, &quot;Kanchi means &#x27;a radiant jewel&#x27; or &#x27;a luxury belt with jewels&#x27;, and puram means a town or a state in the sense of earlier times. Thus, it is understood that the &#x27;香至-Kingdom&#x27; corresponds to the old capital &#x27;Kanchipuram&#x27;.&quot;

Acharya Raghu, in his work &#x27;Bodhidharma Retold&#x27;, used a combination of multiple factors to identify Bodhidharma from the state of Andhra Pradesh in South India, specifically to the geography around Mt. Sailum or modern day Srisailam.

The Pakistani scholar Ahmad Hasan Dani speculated that according to popular accounts in Pakistan&#x27;s northwest, Bodhidharma may be from the region around the Peshawar valley, or possibly around modern Afghanistan&#x27;s eastern border with Pakistan.

=== Caste ===
In the context of the Indian caste system, the mention of &quot;Brahman king&quot; acquires a nuance. Broughton notes that &quot;king&quot; implies that Bodhidharma was of a caste of warriors and rulers. Brahman is, in western contexts, easily understood as Brahmana or Brahmin, which means &quot;priest&quot;.

=== Name ===
According to tradition, Bodhidharma was given this name by his teacher, known variously as Panyatara, Prajnatara, or Prajñādhara. His name prior to monkhood is said to have been Jayavarman.

Bodhidharma is associated with several other names, and is also known by the name Bodhitara. Faure notes that:
Tibetan sources give his name as &quot;Bodhidharmottara&quot; or &quot;Dharmottara&quot;, that is, &quot;Highest teaching (dharma) of enlightenment&quot;.

=== Abode in China ===
Buswell dates Bodhidharma&#x27;s abode in China approximately at the early 5th century. Broughton dates Bodhidharma&#x27;s presence in Luoyang to between 516 and 526, when the temple referred to—Yongning Temple (), was at the height of its glory. Starting in 526, Yǒngníngsì suffered damage from a series of events, ultimately leading to its destruction in 534.

=== Shaolin boxing ===
The idea that Bodhidharma founded martial arts at the Shaolin Temple was spread in the 20th century. Martial arts historians have shown that this legend stems from a 17th-century qigong manual known as the &quot;Yijin Jing&quot; (&quot;Muscle Change Classic,&quot; &quot;Sinews Transformation&#x27;s Classic&quot;). While the Shaolin-minks attributed the origins of their fighting-skills to Vajrapani, the daoist author of the &quot;Yijin Jing&quot; wrongly assumed that the monks attributed these skills to Bodhidharma, due to the daoist tradition of attributing &quot;daoyin&quot; gymnastics to Bodhidharma, and the influence of Buddhism on Daoist meditation techniques. The preface of this work says that Bodhidharma left behind the &quot;Yi Jin Jing&quot;, and further states that the monks obtained the fighting skills which made them gain some fame from this manual.

The attribution of the &quot;Yijin Jing&quot; to Bodhidharma has been discredited early on, and is also rejected by historians like Tang Hao, Xu Zhen, and Matsuda Ryuchi. According to Lin Boyuan, &quot;This manuscript is full of errors, absurdities, and fantastic claims; it cannot be taken as a legitimate source.&quot;

The composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624, while the oldest available copy was published in 1827. In the 19th century, when the &quot;Yijin Jing&quot; became popular in military circles, and the Shaolin monks started to use it, the Shaolin martial tradition became gradually associated with Bodhidharma. The association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904–1907 serialization of the novel &quot;The Travels of Lao Ts&#x27;an&quot; in &quot;Illustrated Fiction Magazine&quot;, which incorporated this newly developed attribution of Shaolin martial arts to Bodhidharma. According to Henning, the &quot;story is clearly a twentieth-century invention,&quot; which &quot;is confirmed by writings going back at least 250 years earlier, which mention both Bodhidharma and martial arts but make no connection between the two.&quot;

== Cultural legacy ==
In the Zen &quot;kōan&quot; tradition, Bodhidharma is mentioned as a significant figure. In Dogen&#x27;s 13th century &quot;kōan&quot; collection, the &quot;Shinji Shōbōgenzō&quot;, Bodhidharma is mentioned in fourteen different &quot;kōans&quot;. In &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot; by Wumen Huikai:

In a short addendum from 1245 CE, the text refers to a motto attributed to Bodhidharma: &quot;Bodhidharma coming from the west, unattached to any words, pointing directly to the mind of man, advocated seeing into one&#x27;s nature and becoming Buddha.&quot; The legend of Dazu Huike and Bodhidharma is recounted in case no. 41 of &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;.

Bodhidharma&#x27;s image became the inspiration for Japanese Daruma dolls, which originated in Meiwa-era Takasaki as good luck charms. A is held at the Shorinzan Daruma Temple in Takasaki every year, celebrating the city as the birthplace of the Daruma doll. Over 400,000 attendants come to purchase new dolls. The Japanese version of the children&#x27;s game statues is named .

A 1989 South Korean film, &quot;Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?&quot;, derives its title from a &quot;kōan&quot; about Bodhidharma&#x27;s legendary transmission of Chan Buddhism to China. The film screened at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and was the first South Korean film to release theatrically in the United States. In 1994, the Hong Kong film &quot;Master of Zen&quot; (also known as &quot;Bodhidharma&quot;) adapted the legends of Bodhidharma&#x27;s life into a martial arts drama film, partly inspired by the master&#x27;s association with Shaolin Kung Fu. The 2011 Indian Tamil science fiction martial arts film &quot;7aum Arivu&quot; features a descendant of Bodhidharma as a main character, with its plot centering on the ancient monk&#x27;s legendary skills and knowledge. The film faced criticism for its historical inaccuracies, particularly regarding Bodhidharma&#x27;s age upon entering China. The controversy led to hunger strikes among Indian followers of Bodhidharma.

== Attributed works ==
Modern scholars, such as the Japanese scholar of early Chan, Yanagida Seizan, agree that only one extant text can be attributed to Bodhidharma. This is the &quot;Two Entrances and Four Practices&quot; &quot;(二入四行論),&quot; also known as &quot;Outline of Practice&quot; (二種入 &quot;Er zhong ru)&quot;, which is part of the larger &quot;Bodhidharma Anthology&quot; that also includes teachings from some of Bodhidharma&#x27;s students, such as Huike and Dharma master Yuan.

There also exists a Dunhuang manuscript titled &quot;Treatise of Dhyana Master Bodhidharma&quot; (&quot;Tianzhu guo Putidamo chan shi lun&quot; 天竺國菩提達摩禪師論). According to McRae, this text &quot;might be taken as a guide to the teachings of early Ch&#x27;an. The text is probably relatively early, although its putative date of compilation or transcription, 681, is not reliable. Unfortunately, its contents do not lend themselves to precise dating.&quot;

=== Later attributions ===
Throughout the history of Chan, various other works became attributed to Bodhidharma and modern scholars have studied these as well, attempting to understand their provenance.

Commonly attributed works include: 
* &quot;Treatise on the Destruction of Characteristics&quot; (《破相論》 &quot;Poxiang lun&quot;), also known as the &quot;Treatise on the Contemplation of the Mind&quot; (觀心論 &quot;Kuan-hsin lun&quot;), according to Yanagida, this is a work of Shenxiu.
* &quot;The Wake-up Treatise&quot; or &quot;Treatise on Realizing the Nature&quot;《悟性論 Wu-hsing lun》, according to Yanagida, this is a later reformulation of ideas of the East mountain teachings and respond to Shenhui&#x27;s criticisms of the school.
* &quot;The Bloodstream Treatise&quot; (血脈論 &quot;Xuemai lun&quot;), according to Yanagida, this is a treatise by a member of the Oxhead school (7th-8th century) of Chan.
*The &quot;Jueguan lun,&quot; (Treatise on the Transcendence of Cognition), a text discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts, has been attributed to Bodhidharma, however it is more likely by an anonymous member of the Oxhead school, an important Chan faction during the Tang dynasty.
* &quot;The Genealogical Treatise&quot; (&quot;Hsueh-mo lun&quot;), this is a &quot;post-Platform Sutra and immediately pre-Ma-tsu text&quot; according to Yanagida, which discusses the teaching that &quot;does not posit words,&quot; and &quot;seeing the nature and achieving buddhahood.&quot; 
* The &quot;Verses on the Heart Sutra&quot;, &quot;a clearly apocryphal text&quot; that introduces Yogacara ideas associated with Xuanzang&#x27;s translations into Chan.

=== Pointing directly to one&#x27;s mind ===
One of the fundamental Chán texts attributed to Bodhidharma is a four-line stanza whose first two verses echo the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;″s disdain for words and whose second two verses stress the importance of the insight into reality achieved through &quot;self-realization&quot;:
The stanza, in fact, is not Bodhidharma&#x27;s, but rather dates to the year 1108.

<text>In propositional logic, biconditional introduction is a valid rule of inference. It allows for one to infer a biconditional from two conditional statements. The rule makes it possible to introduce a biconditional statement into a logical proof. If formula_1 is true, and if formula_2 is true, then one may infer that formula_3 is true. For example, from the statements &quot;if I&#x27;m breathing, then I&#x27;m alive&quot; and &quot;if I&#x27;m alive, then I&#x27;m breathing&quot;, it can be inferred that &quot;I&#x27;m breathing if and only if I&#x27;m alive&quot;. Biconditional introduction is the converse of biconditional elimination. The rule can be stated formally as:

:formula_4

where the rule is that wherever instances of &quot;formula_1&quot; and &quot;formula_2&quot; appear on lines of a proof, &quot;formula_3&quot; can validly be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The &quot;biconditional introduction&quot; rule may be written in sequent notation:
:formula_8

where formula_9 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula_3 is a syntactic consequence when formula_1 and formula_2 are both in a proof;

or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:

:formula_13

where formula_14, and formula_15 are propositions expressed in some formal system.

<doc id="4292" wikidata="Q145911" url="?curid=4292" title="Base pair">
<text>A base pair (bp) is a fundamental unit of double-stranded nucleic acids consisting of two nucleobases bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. They form the building blocks of the DNA double helix and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and RNA. Dictated by specific hydrogen bonding patterns, &quot;Watson–Crick&quot; (or &quot;Watson–Crick–Franklin&quot;) base pairs (guanine–cytosine and adenine–thymine) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its nucleotide sequence. The complementary nature of this based-paired structure provides a redundant copy of the genetic information encoded within each strand of DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which DNA polymerase replicates DNA and RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base-pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.

Intramolecular base pairs can occur within single-stranded nucleic acids. This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., transfer RNA), where Watson–Crick base pairs (guanine–cytosine and adenine–uracil) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non–Watson–Crick interactions (e.g., G–U or A–A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional structures. In addition, base-pairing between transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) forms the basis for the molecular recognition events that result in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming translated into the amino acid sequence of proteins via the genetic code.

The size of an individual gene or an organism&#x27;s entire genome is often measured in base pairs because DNA is usually double-stranded. Hence, the number of total base pairs is equal to the number of nucleotides in one of the strands (with the exception of non-coding single-stranded regions of telomeres). The haploid human genome (23 chromosomes) is estimated to be about 3.2 billion base pairs long and to contain 20,000–25,000 distinct protein-coding genes. A kilobase (kb) is a unit of measurement in molecular biology equal to 1000 base pairs of DNA or RNA. The total number of DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 with a weight of 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 TtC (trillion tons of carbon).

==Hydrogen bonding and stability==

Top, a G.C base pair with three hydrogen bonds. Bottom, an A.T base pair with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the bases are shown as dashed lines. The wiggly lines stand for the connection to the pentose sugar and point in the direction of the minor groove. 

Hydrogen bonding is the chemical interaction that underlies the base-pairing rules described above. Appropriate geometrical correspondence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows only the &quot;right&quot; pairs to form stably. DNA with high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low GC-content. Crucially, however, stacking interactions are primarily responsible for stabilising the double-helical structure; Watson-Crick base pairing&#x27;s contribution to global structural stability is minimal, but its role in the specificity underlying complementarity is, by contrast, of maximal importance as this underlies the template-dependent processes of the central dogma (e.g. DNA replication).

The bigger nucleobases, adenine and guanine, are members of a class of double-ringed chemical structures called purines; the smaller nucleobases, cytosine and thymine (and uracil), are members of a class of single-ringed chemical structures called pyrimidines. Purines are complementary only with pyrimidines: pyrimidine–pyrimidine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too far apart for hydrogen bonding to be established; purine–purine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too close, leading to overlap repulsion. Purine–pyrimidine base-pairing of AT or GC or UA (in RNA) results in proper duplex structure. The only other purine–pyrimidine pairings would be AC and GT and UG (in RNA); these pairings are mismatches because the patterns of hydrogen donors and acceptors do not correspond. The GU pairing, with two hydrogen bonds, does occur fairly often in RNA (see wobble base pair).

Paired DNA and RNA molecules are comparatively stable at room temperature, but the two nucleotide strands will separate above a melting point that is determined by the length of the molecules, the extent of mispairing (if any), and the GC content. Higher GC content results in higher melting temperatures; it is, therefore, unsurprising that the genomes of extremophile organisms such as &quot;Thermus thermophilus&quot; are particularly GC-rich. On the converse, regions of a genome that need to separate frequently — for example, the promoter regions for often-transcribed genes — are comparatively GC-poor (for example, see TATA box). GC content and melting temperature must also be taken into account when designing primers for PCR reactions.

===Examples===
The following DNA sequences illustrate pair double-stranded patterns. By convention, the top strand is written from the 5′-end to the 3′-end; thus, the bottom strand is written 3′ to 5′.

:The corresponding RNA sequence, in which uracil is substituted for thymine in the RNA strand:

==Base analogs and intercalators==
Chemical analogs of nucleotides can take the place of proper nucleotides and establish non-canonical base-pairing, leading to errors (mostly point mutations) in DNA replication and DNA transcription. This is due to their isosteric chemistry. One common mutagenic base analog is 5-bromouracil, which resembles thymine but can base-pair to guanine in its enol form.

Other chemicals, known as DNA intercalators, fit into the gap between adjacent bases on a single strand and induce frameshift mutations by &quot;masquerading&quot; as a base, causing the DNA replication machinery to skip or insert additional nucleotides at the intercalated site. Most intercalators are large polyaromatic compounds and are known or suspected carcinogens. Examples include ethidium bromide and acridine.

==Mismatch repair==

Mismatched base pairs can be generated by errors of DNA replication and as intermediates during homologous recombination. The process of mismatch repair ordinarily must recognize and correctly repair a small number of base mispairs within a long sequence of normal DNA base pairs. To repair mismatches formed during DNA replication, several distinctive repair processes have evolved to distinguish between the template strand and the newly formed strand so that only the newly inserted incorrect nucleotide is removed (in order to avoid generating a mutation). The proteins employed in mismatch repair during DNA replication, and the clinical significance of defects in this process are described in the article DNA mismatch repair. The process of mispair correction during recombination is described in the article gene conversion.

==Length measurements==
The following abbreviations are commonly used to describe the length of a D/RNA molecule:
* bp = base pair—one bp corresponds to approximately 3.4 Å (340 pm) of length along the strand, and to roughly 618 or 643 daltons for DNA and RNA respectively.
* kb (= kbp) = kilo–base-pair = 1,000 bp
* Mb (= Mbp) = mega–base-pair = 1,000,000 bp
* Gb (= Gbp) = giga–base-pair = 1,000,000,000 bp

For single-stranded DNA/RNA, units of nucleotides are used—abbreviated nt (or knt, Mnt, Gnt)—as they are not paired.
To distinguish between units of computer storage and bases, kbp, Mbp, Gbp, etc. may be used for base pairs.

The centimorgan is also often used to imply distance along a chromosome, but the number of base pairs it corresponds to varies widely. In the human genome, the centimorgan is about 1 million base pairs.

==Unnatural base pair (UBP)==

An unnatural base pair (UBP) is a designed subunit (or nucleobase) of DNA which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature. DNA sequences have been described which use newly created nucleobases to form a third base pair, in addition to the two base pairs found in nature, A-T (adenine – thymine) and G-C (guanine – cytosine). A few research groups have been searching for a third base pair for DNA, including teams led by Steven A. Benner, Philippe Marliere, Floyd E. Romesberg and Ichiro Hirao. Some new base pairs based on alternative hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions and metal coordination have been reported.

In 1989 Steven Benner (then working at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) and his team led with modified forms of cytosine and guanine into DNA molecules &quot;in vitro&quot;. The nucleotides, which encoded RNA and proteins, were successfully replicated &quot;in vitro&quot;. Since then, Benner&#x27;s team has been trying to engineer cells that can make foreign bases from scratch, obviating the need for a feedstock.

In 2002, Ichiro Hirao&#x27;s group in Japan developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions in transcription and translation, for the site-specific incorporation of non-standard amino acids into proteins. In 2006, they created 7-(2-thienyl)imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (Ds) and pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (Pa) as a third base pair for replication and transcription. Afterward, Ds and 4-[3-(6-aminohexanamido)-1-propynyl]-2-nitropyrrole (Px) was discovered as a high fidelity pair in PCR amplification. In 2013, they applied the Ds-Px pair to DNA aptamer generation by &quot;in vitro&quot; selection (SELEX) and demonstrated the genetic alphabet expansion significantly augment DNA aptamer affinities to target proteins.

In 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair (UBP). The two new artificial nucleotides or &quot;Unnatural Base Pair&quot; (UBP) were named d5SICS and dNaM. More technically, these artificial nucleotides bearing hydrophobic nucleobases, feature two fused aromatic rings that form a (d5SICS–dNaM) complex or base pair in DNA. His team designed a variety of &quot;in vitro&quot; or &quot;test tube&quot; templates containing the unnatural base pair and they confirmed that it was efficiently replicated with high fidelity in virtually all sequence contexts using the modern standard &quot;in vitro&quot; techniques, namely PCR amplification of DNA and PCR-based applications. Their results show that for PCR and PCR-based applications, the d5SICS–dNaM unnatural base pair is functionally equivalent to a natural base pair, and when combined with the other two natural base pairs used by all organisms, A–T and G–C, they provide a fully functional and expanded six-letter &quot;genetic alphabet&quot;.

In 2014 the same team from the Scripps Research Institute reported that they synthesized a stretch of circular DNA known as a plasmid containing natural T-A and C-G base pairs along with the best-performing UBP Romesberg&#x27;s laboratory had designed and inserted it into cells of the common bacterium &quot;E. coli&quot; that successfully replicated the unnatural base pairs through multiple generations. The transfection did not hamper the growth of the &quot;E. coli&quot; cells and showed no sign of losing its unnatural base pairs to its natural DNA repair mechanisms. This is the first known example of a living organism passing along an expanded genetic code to subsequent generations. Romesberg said he and his colleagues created 300 variants to refine the design of nucleotides that would be stable enough and would be replicated as easily as the natural ones when the cells divide. This was in part achieved by the addition of a supportive algal gene that expresses a nucleotide triphosphate transporter which efficiently imports the triphosphates of both d5SICSTP and dNaMTP into &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria. Then, the natural bacterial replication pathways use them to accurately replicate a plasmid containing d5SICS–dNaM. Other researchers were surprised that the bacteria replicated these human-made DNA subunits.

The successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of amino acids which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 20 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel proteins. The artificial strings of DNA do not encode for anything yet, but scientists speculate they could be designed to manufacture new proteins which could have industrial or pharmaceutical uses. Experts said the synthetic DNA incorporating the unnatural base pair raises the possibility of life forms based on a different DNA code.

== Non-canonical base pairing ==
In addition to the canonical pairing, some conditions can also favour base-pairing with alternative base orientation, and number and geometry of hydrogen bonds. These pairings are accompanied by alterations to the local backbone shape.

The most common of these is the wobble base pairing that occurs between tRNAs and mRNAs at the third base position of many codons during transcription and during the charging of tRNAs by some tRNA synthetases. They have also been observed in the secondary structures of some RNA sequences.

Additionally, Hoogsteen base pairing (typically written as A•U/T and G•C) can exist in some DNA sequences (e.g. CA and TA dinucleotides) in dynamic equilibrium with standard Watson–Crick pairing. They have also been observed in some protein–DNA complexes.

In addition to these alternative base pairings, a wide range of base-base hydrogen bonding is observed in RNA secondary and tertiary structure. These bonds are often necessary for the precise, complex shape of an RNA, as well as its binding to interaction partners.

<text>The Baltimore Ravens are a professional American football team based in Baltimore. The Ravens compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at M&amp;T Bank Stadium and is headquartered in Owings Mills, Maryland.

The Baltimore Ravens were established in 1996 after Art Modell, then owner of the Cleveland Browns, announced plans in 1995 to relocate the franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore. As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns&#x27; history, team colors, and records in Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would resume play in 1999. In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore, where such personnel would form an expansion team. Steve Bisciotti has been the Ravens&#x27; majority owner since 2004; the franchise was valued at $4.63 billion in 2023, making it the 28th-most valuable sports franchise in the world.

The Ravens have been one of the most successful NFL franchises since their inception, compiling a regular season record of , the highest among active franchises. They also own the fourth-highest playoff winning percentage at . The team has qualified for the NFL playoffs 16 times since 2000 with two Super Bowl titles (Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLVII), two AFC Championship titles (2000 and 2012), five AFC Championship game appearances (2000, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2023), and eight AFC North division titles (2003, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2018, 2019, 2023, and 2024). They are one of two teams to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowl appearances, along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Ravens organization was led by general manager Ozzie Newsome from 1996 until his retirement following the 2018 season, and has had three head coaches: Ted Marchibroda, Brian Billick, and since 2008, John Harbaugh. Starting with a record-breaking defensive performance in their 2000 season, the Ravens have established a reputation for strong defensive play throughout team history. Former players such as middle linebacker Ray Lewis, safety Ed Reed, and offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==History==
===Team name===
The name &quot;Ravens&quot; was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot;. Chosen in a fan contest that drew 33,288 voters, the allusion honors Poe who spent the early part of his career in Baltimore and is buried there. Other names polled included &quot;Marauders&quot;, &quot;Americans&quot;, and &quot;Bombers&quot;, among others. As &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reported at the time, fans also &quot;liked the tie-in with the other birds in town, the Orioles, and found it easy to visualize a tough, menacing black bird&quot;. Edgar Allan Poe also had distant relatives who played football for the Princeton Tigers in the 1880s through the early 1900s. These brothers were famous players in the early days of American football.

Before the football team, there was the Baltimore Ravens wheelchair basketball team — the original Baltimore Ravens. In 1972, the Ravens wheelchair basketball team was founded by Ralph Smith, long-term resident of Baltimore, second Vice President of the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA) and Member of the NWBA Hall of Fame. The name &quot;Ravens&quot; was inspired by Bob Ardinger, a member of the Ravens wheelchair basketball team. In the 1990s, the naming rights were later sold to the football team when they came to the city and the wheelchair basketball team became known as the Maryland Ravens.

===Background===
After the controversial 1984 relocation of the Colts to Indianapolis, several attempts were made to bring an NFL team back to Baltimore. In 1993, ahead of the 1995 league expansion, the city was considered a favorite, behind only St. Louis, to be granted one of two new franchises. League officials and team owners feared litigation due to conflicts between rival bidding groups if St. Louis was awarded a franchise. In October Charlotte, North Carolina was the first city chosen. Several weeks later, Baltimore&#x27;s bid for a franchise—dubbed the Baltimore Bombers, in honor of the locally produced Martin B-26 Marauder bomber—had three ownership groups in place and a state financial package which included a proposed $200 million, rent-free stadium and permission to charge up to $80 million in personal seat license fees. Baltimore, however, was unexpectedly passed over in favor of Jacksonville, Florida, despite Jacksonville&#x27;s minor TV market status and that the city had withdrawn from contention in the summer, only to return with then-Commissioner Paul Tagliabue&#x27;s urging. Although league officials denied that any city had been favored, it was reported that Tagliabue and his longtime friend Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke had lobbied against Baltimore due to its proximity to Washington, D.C., and that Tagliabue had used the initial committee voting system to prevent the entire league ownership from voting on Baltimore&#x27;s bid. This led to public outrage and &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; describing Tagliabue as having an &quot;Anybody But Baltimore&quot; policy. Maryland governor William Donald Schaefer said afterward that Tagliabue had led him on, praising Baltimore and the proposed owners while working behind-the-scenes to oppose Baltimore&#x27;s bid.

By May 1994, Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos had gathered a new group of investors, including author Tom Clancy, to bid on teams whose owners had expressed interest in relocating. Angelos found a potential partner in Georgia Frontiere, who was open to moving the Los Angeles Rams to Baltimore. Jack Kent Cooke opposed the move, intending to build the Redskins&#x27; new stadium in Laurel, Maryland, close enough to Baltimore to cool outside interest in bringing in a new franchise. This led to heated arguments between Cooke and Angelos, who accused Cooke of being a &quot;carpetbagger&quot;. The league eventually persuaded Rams team president John Shaw to relocate to St. Louis instead, leading to a league-wide rumor that Tagliabue was again steering interest away from Baltimore, a claim which Tagliabue denied. In response to anger in Baltimore, including Governor Schaefer&#x27;s threat to announce over the loudspeakers Tagliabue&#x27;s exact location in Camden Yards any time he attended a Baltimore Orioles game, Tagliabue remarked of Baltimore&#x27;s financial package: &quot;Maybe (Baltimore) can open another museum with that money.&quot; Following this, Angelos made an unsuccessful $200 million bid to bring the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to Baltimore.

Having failed to obtain a franchise via the expansion, the city, despite having &quot;misgivings&quot;, turned to the possibility of obtaining the Cleveland Browns, whose owner Art Modell was financially struggling and at odds with the city of Cleveland over needed improvements to the team&#x27;s stadium.

===Return of American football in Baltimore===

Enticed by Baltimore&#x27;s available funds for a first-class stadium and a promised yearly operating subsidy of $25 million, Modell announced on November 6, 1995, his intention to relocate the team from Cleveland to Baltimore the following year. The resulting controversy ended when representatives of Cleveland and the NFL reached a settlement on February 8, 1996. Tagliabue promised the city of Cleveland that an NFL team would be located in Cleveland, either through relocation or expansion, &quot;no later than 1999&quot;. Additionally, the agreement stipulated that the Browns&#x27; name, colors, uniform design and franchise records would remain in Cleveland. The franchise history includes Browns club records and connections with Pro Football Hall of Fame players. Modell&#x27;s Baltimore team, while retaining all current player contracts, would, for purposes of team history, appear as an expansion team, a new franchise. Not all players, staff or front office would make the move to Baltimore, however.
After relocation, Modell hired Ted Marchibroda as the head coach for his new team in Baltimore. Marchibroda was already well known because of his work as head coach of the Baltimore Colts during the 1970s and the Indianapolis Colts during the early 1990s. Ozzie Newsome, the Browns&#x27; tight end for many seasons, joined Modell in Baltimore as director of football operations. He was later promoted to vice-president/general manager.

The home stadium for the Ravens first two seasons was Baltimore&#x27;s Memorial Stadium, previously home to the Baltimore Colts, the Baltimore Orioles, and the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Baltimore Stallions. The Ravens moved to their own new stadium, now known as M&amp;T Bank Stadium, next to Camden Yards in 1998.

===The early years and Ted Marchibroda era (1996–1998)===
In the 1996 NFL draft, the Ravens, with two picks in the first round, drafted offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden at No. 4 overall and linebacker Ray Lewis at No. 26 overall. Both Ogden and Lewis went on to play for the Ravens for their entire professional careers and were both inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
The 1996 Ravens won their opening game against the Oakland Raiders, but finished the season 4–12 despite receiver Michael Jackson leading the league with 14 touchdown catches. The 1997 Ravens started 3–1. Peter Boulware, a rookie defender from Florida State, recorded 11.5 sacks and was named AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year. The team finished 6–9–1. On October 26, the team made its first trip to Landover, Maryland to play their new regional rivals, the Washington Redskins. The Ravens won the game 20–17. On December 14, 1997, the Ravens played the final professional sporting event at Baltimore&#x27;s historic Memorial Stadium, winning 21–19 over the Tennessee Oilers.

1998 marked the opening of a new stadium for the Ravens, currently known as M&amp;T Bank Stadium, but originally named &quot;PSINet Stadium&quot; after the now-defunct internet service provider which purchased the original naming rights. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde left for the New York Jets before the season, and was replaced by former Indianapolis Colt Jim Harbaugh, and later Eric Zeier. Cornerback Rod Woodson joined the team after a successful stint with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Priest Holmes started getting the first playing time of his career and ran for 1,000 yards. The Ravens finished 1998 with a 6–10 record. On November 29, the Ravens welcomed the Colts back to Baltimore for the first time in 15 years. Amidst a shower of negative cheers towards the Colts, the Ravens won 38–31.

===Brian Billick era (1999–2007)===

Three consecutive losing seasons under Marchibroda led to a change in the head coach. Brian Billick took over as head coach in 1999. Billick had been offensive coordinator for the record-setting Minnesota Vikings the season before. Quarterback Tony Banks came to Baltimore from the St. Louis Rams and had the best season of his career with 17 touchdown passes and an 81.2 pass rating. He was joined by receiver Qadry Ismail, who posted a 1,000-yard season. The Ravens initially struggled with a record of 4–7 but managed to finish with an 8–8 record.

Due to continual financial hardships for the organization, the NFL took an unusual move and directed Modell to initiate the sale of his franchise. On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti. In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004, the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti&#x27;s purchase of the majority stake in the club.

====2000: Super Bowl XXXV champions====

Banks shared playing time in the 2000 regular season with Trent Dilfer. Both players put up decent numbers (and a 1,364-yard rushing season by rookie Jamal Lewis helped too) but the defense became the team&#x27;s hallmark and bailed a struggling offense out in many instances through the season. Ray Lewis was named Defensive Player of the Year. Two of his defensive teammates, Sam Adams and Rod Woodson, made the Pro Bowl. Baltimore&#x27;s season started strong with a 5–1 record. But the team struggled through mid-season, at one point going five games without scoring an offensive touchdown. The team regrouped and won each of their last seven games, finishing 12–4 and making the playoffs for the first time.

During the 2000 season, the Ravens&#x27; dominating defense broke a notable NFL record. They held opposing teams to 165 total points, surpassing the 1986 Chicago Bears mark of 187 points for a 16-game season, which at that time was the current NFL record. That record still stands, and the 2000 Ravens remain in the discussion as one of the greatest NFL defenses of all time, most notably alongside the 1985 Chicago Bears defense.

Since the divisional rival Tennessee Titans had a record of 13–3, the Ravens had to play in the wild card round. They dominated the Denver Broncos 21–3 in their first game. In the divisional playoff, they went on the road to Tennessee. With the score tied 10–10 in the fourth quarter, an Al Del Greco field goal attempt was blocked and returned for a touchdown by Anthony Mitchell, and a Ray Lewis interception return for a score put the game squarely in Baltimore&#x27;s favor. The 24–10 win put the Ravens in the AFC Championship against the Oakland Raiders. The game was rarely in doubt. Shannon Sharpe&#x27;s 96-yard touchdown catch early in the second quarter followed by an injury to Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon were crucial as the Ravens won easily, 16–3.
Baltimore then went to Tampa for Super Bowl XXXV against the New York Giants. The Ravens&#x27; defense carried them to a win. They recorded four sacks and forced five turnovers, one of which was a Kerry Collins interception returned for a touchdown by Duane Starks. The Giants&#x27; only score was a Ron Dixon kickoff return for a touchdown; however, the Ravens immediately countered with a touchdown return on the ensuing kickoff by Jermaine Lewis. The Ravens became champions with a 34–7 win.

====2001–2007====
In 2001, the Ravens attempted to defend their title with Elvis Grbac as their new starting quarterback, but a season-ending injury to Jamal Lewis on the first day of training camp and poor offensive performances stymied the team. After a 3–3 start, the Ravens defeated the Minnesota Vikings in the final week to clinch a wild card berth at 10–6. In the first round the Ravens showed flashes of their previous year with a 20–3 win over the Miami Dolphins, in which the team forced three turnovers and out-gained the Dolphins 347 yards to 151. In the divisional playoff the Ravens played the Pittsburgh Steelers. Three interceptions by Grbac ended the Ravens&#x27; season, as they lost 27–10.

Baltimore ran into salary cap problems entering the 2002 season and was forced to part with a number of impactful players. In the NFL Draft, the team selected Ed Reed with the 24th overall pick. Reed would go on to become one of the best safeties in NFL history, making nine Pro Bowls until leaving the Ravens for the Houston Texans in 2013. Despite low expectations, the Ravens stayed somewhat competitive in 2002 until a losing streak in December eliminated any chances of a postseason berth and a 7–9 finish.
In 2003, the Ravens drafted their new quarterback, Kyle Boller, but he was injured midway through the season and was replaced by Anthony Wright. Jamal Lewis ran for 2,066 yards (including a then-NFL record 295 yards in one game against the Cleveland Browns on September 14). With a 10–6 record, Baltimore won their first AFC North division title. Their first playoff game, at home against the Tennessee Titans, went back and forth, with the Ravens being held to only 54 yards total rushing. The Titans won 20–17 on a late field goal, and Baltimore&#x27;s season ended early.

Ray Lewis was also named Defensive Player of the year for the second time in his career.

In April 2003, Art Modell sold 49% of the team to Steve Bisciotti, a local businessman who had made his fortune in the temporary staffing field. After the season, Art Modell sold his remaining 51% ownership to Bisciotti, ending over 40 years of tenure as an NFL franchise owner.

The Ravens did not make the playoffs in 2004 and finished the season with a record of 9–7 with Boller spending the season at QB. They did get good play from veteran corner Deion Sanders and third-year safety Ed Reed, who won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. They were also the only team to defeat the 15–1 Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular season.
The next off-season, the Ravens looked to augment their receiving corps (which was second-worst in the NFL in 2004) by signing Derrick Mason from the Titans and drafting Oklahoma wide receiver Mark Clayton in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft. However, the Ravens ended their season 6–10.
The 2006 Baltimore Ravens season began with the team trying to improve on their 6–10 record of 2005. The Ravens, for the first time in franchise history, started 4–0, under the leadership of former Titans quarterback Steve McNair.

In 2006, The Ravens lost two straight games mid-season on offensive troubles, prompting coach Billick to drop their offensive coordinator Jim Fassel in their week seven bye. After the bye, and with Billick calling the offense, Baltimore would record a five-game win streak before losing to the Cincinnati Bengals in week 13. Still ranked second overall to first-place San Diego Chargers, the Ravens continued on. They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, and held the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers to only one touchdown at Heinz Field, allowing the Ravens to clinch the AFC North.

The Ravens ended the regular season with a franchise-best 13–3 record. Baltimore had secured the AFC North title, the No. 2 AFC playoff seed, and clinched a 1st-round bye by season&#x27;s end. The Ravens were slated to face the Indianapolis Colts in the second round of the playoffs, in the first meeting of the two teams in the playoffs. Many Baltimore and Indianapolis fans saw this historic meeting as a sort of &quot;Judgment Day&quot; with the new team of Baltimore facing the old team of Baltimore (the former Baltimore Colts having left Baltimore under questionable circumstances in 1984). Both Indianapolis and Baltimore were held to scoring only field goals as the two defenses slugged it out all over M&amp;T Bank Stadium. McNair threw two costly interceptions, including one at the 1-yard line. The eventual Super Bowl champion Colts won 15–6, ending Baltimore&#x27;s season.
The Ravens hoped to improve upon their 13–3 record but injuries and poor play plagued the team. The Ravens finished the 2007 season in the AFC North cellar with a disappointing 5–11 record. A humiliating 22–16 overtime loss to the previously winless Miami Dolphins on December 16 ultimately led to Billick&#x27;s dismissal after the end of the regular season. He was replaced by John Harbaugh, the special teams coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and the older brother of former Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh (1998).

===John Harbaugh/Joe Flacco era (2008–2018)===

====2008: Arrival of Harbaugh and Flacco====
With rookies at head coach (John Harbaugh) and quarterback (Joe Flacco), the Ravens entered the 2008 campaign with much uncertainty. Baltimore smartly recovered in 2008, winning eleven games and achieving a wild card spot in the postseason. On the strength of four interceptions, one resulting in an Ed Reed touchdown, the Ravens began its postseason run by winning a rematch over Miami 27–9 at Dolphin Stadium on January 4, 2009, in a wild-card game. Six days later, they advanced to the AFC Championship Game by avenging a Week 5 loss to the Titans 13–10 at LP Field on a Matt Stover field goal with 53 seconds left in regulation time. The Ravens fell one victory short of Super Bowl XLIII by losing to the Steelers 23–14 at Heinz Field on January 18, 2009.

====2009–2011====
In 2009, the Ravens won their first three games, then lost the next three, including a close match in Minnesota. The rest of the season was an uneven string of wins and losses, which included a home victory over Pittsburgh in overtime followed by a Monday Night loss in Green Bay. That game was notable for the number of penalties committed, costing a total of 310 yards, and almost tying with the record set by Tampa Bay and Seattle in 1976. Afterwards, the Ravens easily crushed the Lions and Bears, giving up less than ten points in both games. The next match was against the Steelers, where Baltimore lost a close one before beating the Raiders to end the season. With a record of 9–7, the team finished second in the division and gained another wild card. Moving into the playoffs, they overwhelmed the Patriots 33–14; nevertheless they did not reach the AFC Championship because they were routed 20–3 by the Colts in the Divisional Round a week later.

Baltimore managed to beat the Jets 10–9 on the 2010 opener, but then lost a poorly played game against Cincinnati the following week. The Ravens rebounded against the other two division teams, beating Cleveland 24–17 in Week 3 and then. The Ravens scored a fine win (31–17) at home against Denver in Week 5. The Ravens finished the season 12–4, second in the division due to a tiebreaker with Pittsburgh, and earning a wild card spot. Baltimore headed to Kansas City and defeated the Chiefs 30–7, but once again were knocked from the playoffs by Pittsburgh in a hard-fought game 31–24.
The Ravens hosted their arch-enemy in Week 1 of the 2011 season. On a hot, humid day in M&amp;T Bank Stadium, crowd noise and multiple Steelers mistakes allowed Baltimore to crush them with four touchdowns 35–7. The frustrated Pittsburgh players also committed several costly penalties. Thus, the Ravens had gained their first-ever victory over the Steelers with Ben Roethlisberger playing and avenged themselves of repeated regular and postseason losses in the series.

But in Week 2, the Ravens collapsed in Tennessee and lost 26–13. They rebounded by routing the Rams in Week 3 and then overpowering the Jets 34–17 in Week 4.
Week 5, the Ravens had a bye week, following a game against the Texans. But in Week 7, Baltimore had a stunning MNF upset loss in Jacksonville as they were held to one touchdown in a 12–7 loss. Their final scoring drive failed as Joe Flacco threw an interception in the closing seconds of the game.
After beating the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17 of the regular season, the Ravens advanced to the playoffs as the Number 2 seed in the AFC with a record of 12–4. They gained the distinction of AFC North Champions over Pittsburgh (12–4) due to a tie-breaker.

Ravens&#x27; Lee Evans was stripped of a 14-yard touchdown pass by the Patriots Sterling Moore with 22 seconds left and Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff pushed a 32-yard field goal attempt wide left on fourth down as the Patriots held on to beat the Ravens 23–20 during the AFC championship game and advance to Super Bowl XLVI.

====2012: Ray Lewis&#x27; final season and second Super Bowl victory====

The Ravens&#x27; attempt to convert Joe Flacco into a pocket passer remained a work in progress as the 2012 season began. Terrell Suggs suffered a tendon injury during an off-season basketball game and was unable to play for at least several weeks. In the opener on September 10, Baltimore routed Cincinnati 44–13. After this easy win, the team headed to Philadelphia, but lost 24–23.

Returning home for a primetime rematch of the AFC Championship, another bizarre game ensued. New England picked apart the Baltimore defense (which was considerably weakened without Terrell Suggs and some other players lost over the off-season) for the first half. Trouble began early in the game when a streaker ran out onto the field and had to be tackled by security, and accelerated when, at 2:18 in the 4th quarter, the referees made a holding call on RG Marshal Yanda. Enraged fans repeatedly chanted an obscenity at this penalty. The Ravens finally drove downfield and on the last play of the game, Justin Tucker kicked a 27-yard field goal to win the game 31–30, capping off a second intense and controversially officiated game in a row for the Ravens.

The Ravens would win the AFC North with a 10–6 record, but finished 4th in the AFC playoff seeding, and thus had to play a wild-card game. After defeating the Indianapolis Colts 24–9 at home (the final home game of Ray Lewis), the Ravens traveled to Denver to play against the top-seeded Broncos. In a very back-and-forth contest, the Ravens pulled out a 38–35 victory in two overtimes. They then won their 2nd AFC championship by coming back from a 13–7 halftime deficit to defeat the Patriots once again, 28–13.

The Ravens played the Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers. Baltimore built a 28–6 lead early in the third quarter before a partial power outage in the Superdome suspended play for 34 minutes (earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl). After play resumed, San Francisco scored 17 unanswered third-quarter points to cut the Ravens&#x27; lead, 28–23, and continued to chip away in the fourth quarter. With the Ravens leading late in the game, 34–29, the 49ers advanced to the Baltimore 7-yard line just before the two-minute warning but turned the ball over on downs. The Ravens then took an intentional safety in the waning moments of the game to preserve the victory. Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco, who completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns, was named Super Bowl MVP.

====2013–2018====
Coming off as the defending Super Bowl champions, this was the first year in franchise history for the team without Ray Lewis. The Ravens started out 3–2, and started the 2–0 Houston Texans 14-loss streak by shutting them 30–9 in Week 3. However, the Ravens lost their next 3 games, losing to the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers in last-minute field goals and were shut out in an attempt to tie the game against the Cleveland Browns 24–18.

After winning and losing their next game, the Ravens came out 4–6, but managed winning their next four games in dominating the Jets 19–3, a Steelers win 22–20 during Thanksgiving, a booming ending in Baltimore against the Vikings 29–26, and an 18–16 win at Detroit, including Justin Tucker&#x27;s 61-yard game-winning field goal. The Ravens were 8–6, with the 6th seed, but after losing their next two games, and the San Diego Chargers winning their next two to clinch the 6th seed, the Ravens finished 8–8 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007.

On January 27, 2014, the Ravens hired former Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak to be their new offensive coordinator after Jim Caldwell accepted the new available head coaching job with the Detroit Lions. On February 15, 2014, star running back Ray Rice and his fiancée Janay Palmer were arrested and charged with assault after a physical altercation at Revel Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Celebrity news website TMZ posted a video of Rice dragging Palmer&#x27;s body out of an elevator after apparently knocking her out. For the incident, Rice was initially suspended for the first two games of the 2014 NFL season on July 25, 2014, which led to widespread criticism of the NFL.

In Week 1, on September 7, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the Cincinnati Bengals, 23–16. The next day, on September 8, 2014, TMZ released additional footage from an elevator camera showing Rice punching Palmer. The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice&#x27;s contract as a result, and was later indefinitely suspended by the NFL, although a judge later vacated this indefinite suspension. In Week 12, the Ravens traveled down for an interconference battle with the New Orleans Saints, which the Ravens won. In Week 16, the Ravens traveled to Houston to take on the Texans. In one of Flacco&#x27;s worst performances, the offense sputtered against the Houston defense and Flacco threw three interceptions, falling to the Texans 25–13. With their playoff chances and season hanging in the balance, the Ravens took on the Browns in Week 17 at home. After three quarters had gone by and down 10–3, Joe Flacco led the Ravens on a comeback scoring 17 unanswered points, winning 20–10. With the win, and the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Diego Chargers, the Ravens clinched their sixth playoff berth in seven seasons.

In the wild card round, the Ravens won 30–17 against their divisional rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, at Heinz Field. In the next game in the Divisional round, the Ravens faced the New England Patriots. Despite a strong offensive effort and having a 14-point lead twice in the game, the Ravens were defeated by the Patriots 35–31, ending their season.

The 2015 season marked 20 seasons of the franchise&#x27;s existence competing in the NFL, which the franchise recognized with a special badge being worn on their uniforms during the 2015 NFL season. The Ravens lost key players such as Joe Flacco, Justin Forsett, Terrell Suggs, Steve Smith Sr., and Eugene Monroe to season-ending injuries. Injuries and their inability to win close games early in the season led to the first losing season in the Harbaugh-Flacco era with a 5–11 mark. The 2016 Ravens finished 8–8, but failed to qualify the playoffs for the second straight year. They were eliminated from playoff contention after their Week 16 loss to their division rivals, the Steelers. This was the first time the Ravens missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons since 2004–2005, as well as the first in the Harbaugh/Flacco era.

During the 2017 season, the Ravens improved upon their 8–8 record from 2016 by one win, finishing the season 9–7 and missing the playoffs for the third year in a row. This marked the first time the Ravens failed to make the playoffs in three straight seasons since the team&#x27;s first three years of existence (1996–1998). The Ravens suffered a loss at home to the Cincinnati Bengals in the final game of the season that prevented them from earning a playoff berth.

===Lamar Jackson era (2018–present)===

The Ravens drafted quarterback Lamar Jackson with the 32nd pick in the 2018 draft. After the team started the season with a 4–5 record, Jackson took over as the starting QB in Week 11 when Joe Flacco was sidelined with a hip injury. The team won six of its next seven games, finishing the 2018 season with a 10–6 record and winning the AFC North, giving them their first playoff appearance since 2014 and their first division title since 2012. The Ravens lost to the Los Angeles Chargers in the Wild Card round with Jackson at quarterback, making him the youngest QB in NFL history to start a playoff game. At the conclusion of the season, Ozzie Newsome stepped down as the team&#x27;s general manager. He was replaced by longtime assistant Eric DeCosta.

On March 13, 2019, the Ravens traded Joe Flacco to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft. That season, Lamar Jackson led the Ravens to a franchise-best 14–2 record, including a 12-game winning streak to finish the regular season. On December 22, they clinched home-field advantage for the first time in franchise history following a win over the Cleveland Browns. On December 8, Jackson became only the second player in NFL history to rush for over 1,000 yards from the quarterback position. Four days later, Jackson broke Michael Vick&#x27;s single-season quarterback rushing record of 1,037 yards. Thirteen Ravens were selected to the 2019 Pro Bowl, matching the all-time NFL record.
The Ravens finished the 2019 regular season with 3,296 rushing yards, the most rushing yards by any team in NFL history during a season and they became the first team in NFL history to average at least 200 passing yards and 200 rushing yards per game in the same season.

Despite earning the number-one seed in the playoffs, the Ravens were eliminated by the sixth-seeded Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, 28–12. Lamar Jackson was unanimously voted AP NFL MVP, becoming only the second player in NFL history to do so, after Tom Brady in 2010.

In 2020, the Ravens went 6–5 in their first 11 games, but rebounded and finished the season 11–5, taking second place in the AFC North and earning a Wild Card playoff berth with the fifth seed. They also led the NFL in rushing yards for the second year in a row during the regular season, with 3,071 yards. In the Wild Card round, they defeated the fourth-seeded Tennessee Titans in Nashville, 20–13. In the Divisional Round, they fell to the second-seeded Buffalo Bills, 17–3.

In 2021, the Ravens claimed the record of consecutive preseason wins with 20, overtaking Vince Lombardi&#x27;s Green Bay Packers record. In Week 3 of the 2021 season against the Detroit Lions, Justin Tucker put his name in the NFL record books by kicking the longest field goal in the history of the National Football League, 66 yards, which also was the field goal that won the game and 5 yards longer than his previous career long of 61 yards that was also kicked in Detroit. The following week, the Ravens tied the NFL record of consecutive 100 yard rushing games by a team with 43 in a win over the Denver Broncos, equaling the 1974 to &#x27;77 Pittsburgh Steelers record. The team reached an 8–3 record by Week 12, but ended the season on a six-game losing streak to finish 8–9, missing the playoffs and coming in last in the AFC North. Jackson sustained an ankle injury during the Week 14 loss to the Browns and did not appear in any subsequent games. In the 2022 season, the Ravens finished with a 10–7 record, which finished second in the AFC North. They lost in the Wild Card Round 24–17 to the Cincinnati Bengals. 

In the 2023 season, the Ravens finished with a 13–4 record, which earned them the AFC North title and the #1 overall seed for the AFC playoffs. In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Houston Texans 34–10. In the AFC Championship, they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 17–10.

Prior to the start of the 2024 season, the Ravens acquired All-Pro running back Derrick Henry and by week 6 became the first NFL team to post six straight games with at least 150 yards and one touchdown through the air and one on the ground. In the 2024 season, the Ravens finished with a 12–5 record and won the AFC North title. The Ravens defeated the Steelers 28–14 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Bills 27–25 in the Divisional Round.

==Rivalries==
===Divisional===
====Pittsburgh Steelers====
By far the team&#x27;s biggest rival is the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are separated by a less-than-5-hour drive along Interstate 70. Both teams are known for their hard-hitting physical style of play. They play twice a year in the AFC North, and have met five times in the playoffs. Pittsburgh leads the all-time series, 33–25, and holds a 3–2 advantage in the five matchups in the postseason. Games between these two teams usually come down to the wire as most within the last 5 years have come down to under 4 points.
The rivalry is considered one of the most significant and intense in the NFL today.

====Cincinnati Bengals====
The Ravens&#x27; rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 32–27 as of the 2024 season. The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.

====Cleveland Browns====

The Browns–Ravens rivalry in the AFC North began when the Cleveland Browns resumed operations in 1999, after suspending operations for three seasons after the original Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens. The rivalry between the Browns and Ravens was more directed at former Browns owner Art Modell, who orchestrated the move, than the team itself, and has, by most Ravens fans, been simply considered a divisional game. The rivalry has been largely one-sided, as the Ravens hold a 37–15 series lead as of the end of the 2024 season. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.

===Conference===
====New England Patriots====

The Ravens first met the New England Patriots in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27–24 loss in the Patriots&#x27; quest for perfection. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Patriots beat the Ravens 27–21 in a game that involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game.

As of the 2023 season, the Patriots lead the overall series, 11–5. The two teams have split four postseason meetings, 2–2. The Ravens won the 2009 Wild Card Round, 33–14, and the 2012 AFC Championship game, 28–13. The Patriots won the 2011 AFC Championship Game 23–20 and the 2014 Divisional Round, 35–31.

====Tennessee Titans====

Reemerging in the late 2010s, the rivalry between the Ravens and Tennessee Titans actually started in the early 2000s when both teams were in the AFC Central, with both teams having tough and bitter games. The Ravens gave the Titans their first ever loss at the new Adelphia Coliseum in the 2000 season and the Ravens eliminated Tennessee during the playoffs later on. Fans and analysts have noted an emerging rivalry between the Baltimore Ravens and the Tennessee Titans of the AFC South. While there is no known animosity between the cities of Baltimore and Nashville, games between their respective teams have become heated and included fiery verbal exchanges between coaches and players. In the five postseason matchups between the two teams, the road team has won every time to date. As of the 2023 season, the Ravens lead the all-time series 14–13.

===Instate===
==== Beltway Bowl: Washington Commanders ====
Though the two teams only play each other every 4 years, the Ravens have taken part in a minor geographic rivalry with the Washington Commanders as both stadiums are approximately 40 miles apart. The Commanders particularly had long blocked the return of an NFL team to Baltimore since the Colts franchise relocated to Indianapolis in 1984. Former owner Jack Kent Cooke had been accused in multiple instances of orchestrating any means to prevent the city from receiving a new franchise until the Cleveland Browns relocated to Baltimore in 1996, prompting Cooke to put the Redskins&#x27; then-new stadium in Landover, Maryland. The two teams play each other annually during the preseason. The Ravens currently lead the all-time series 4–3.

==Overall head-to-head record vs. NFL teams==
==Logo controversy==
The team&#x27;s first helmet logo, used from 1996 through the 1999 Pro Bowl, featured raven wings outspread from a shield displaying a letter &quot;B&quot; framed by the word &quot;Ravens&quot; overhead and a cross bottony underneath. The US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict that the logo infringed on a copyright retained by Frederick E. Bouchat, an amateur artist and security guard in Maryland, though he was not awarded a dollar amount for his claim.

Bouchat had submitted his design to the Maryland Stadium Authority by fax after learning that Baltimore was to acquire an NFL team. He was not credited for the design when the logo was announced. Bouchat sued the team, claiming to be the designer of the emblem; representatives of the team asserted that the image had been designed independently. The court ruled in favor of Bouchat, noting that team owner Modell had access to Bouchat&#x27;s work. Bouchat&#x27;s fax had gone to John Moag, the Maryland Stadium Authority chairman, whose office was located in the same building as Modell&#x27;s. Bouchat ultimately was not awarded monetary compensation in the damages phase of the case.

&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; ran a poll showing three designs for new helmet logos. Fans participating in the poll expressed a preference for a raven&#x27;s head in profile over other designs. Art Modell announced that he would honor this preference but still wanted a letter &quot;B&quot; to appear somewhere in the design. The new Ravens logo, introduced in 1999, featured a raven&#x27;s head in profile with the letter B superimposed. The secondary logo is a shield that honors Baltimore&#x27;s history of heraldry. Alternating Calvert and Crossland emblems (seen also in the flag of Maryland and the flag of Baltimore) are interlocked with stylized letters &quot;B&quot; and &quot;R&quot;.

==Uniforms==
The design of the Ravens uniform has remained essentially unchanged since the team&#x27;s inaugural season in 1996. Art Modell admitted to ESPN&#x27;s Roy Firestone that the Ravens&#x27; colors, introduced in early 1996, were inspired by the Northwestern Wildcats 1995 dream season. Helmets are black with purple &quot;talon&quot; stripes rising from the facemask to the crown. Players normally wear purple jerseys at home and white jerseys on the road. In 1996 the team wore black pants with a single large white stripe for all games.

In 1997 the Ravens opted for a more classic NFL look with white pants sporting stripes in purple and black, along with the jerseys sporting a different font for the uniform numbers. The white pants were worn with both home and road jerseys. The road uniform (white pants with white jerseys) was worn by the Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV, at the end of the 2000 NFL season. This all-white combination was originally worn with black socks, but starting in 2021, the Ravens began wearing white hosiery with the all-white uniform.

In the 2002 season the Ravens began the practice of wearing white jerseys for the home opener that has a 1:00 kickoff. In recent seasons, the practice has come when the home game is played in week one. Since John Harbaugh became the head coach in 2008, the Ravens have also worn their white jerseys at home for preseason games.

In November 2004 the team introduced an alternate uniform design featuring black jerseys and solid black pants with black socks. The all-black uniform was first worn for a home game against the Cleveland Browns, entitled &quot;Pitch Black&quot; night, that resulted in a Ravens win. The uniform has since been worn for select prime-time national game broadcasts and other games of significance.

The Ravens began wearing black pants again with the white jersey in 2008. On December 7, 2008, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Washington Redskins, the Ravens introduced a new combination of black jersey with white pants. It was believed to be due to the fact that John Harbaugh doesn&#x27;t like the &quot;blackout&quot; look. However, on December 19, 2010, the Ravens wore their black jerseys and black pants in a 30–24 victory over the New Orleans Saints.

Since 2010, the Ravens have worn their black jerseys at least twice each season. From 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, they wore the all blacks once and the black on white once. In 2014 and 2016, they wore all black both times they wore alternate uniforms. In 2017, they wore all black twice and black on white once (although the league is supposed to limit teams to wearing alternate jerseys a maximum of two times a season).

On December 5, 2010, the Ravens reverted to the black pants with the purple jerseys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers during NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; telecast. The Ravens lost to the Steelers 13–10. They wore the same look again for their game against the Cleveland Browns on December 24, 2011, and they won, 20–14. They wore this combination a third time against the Houston Texans on January 15, 2012, in the AFC Divisional playoff. They won 20–13. They would again wear this combination on January 6, 2013, during the AFC Wild Card playoff and what turned out to be Ray Lewis&#x27; final home game, where they defeated the Indianapolis Colts 24–9.

From their inaugural season until 2006, the Ravens wore white cleats with their uniforms; they switched to black cleats in 2007. From the mid-2010s onward, the NFL relaxed its rules regarding primary cleat colors, and Ravens players began wearing customized cleats in either purple, black, gold or white.

On December 20, 2015, the team unexpectedly debuted gold pants for the first time, wearing them with their regular purple jerseys against the Kansas City Chiefs. Although gold is an official accent color of the Ravens, the pants got an overwhelmingly negative response on social media by both Ravens fans and fans of other NFL teams, with some comparisons being made to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; pants, and mustard.

During the 2015 season, the NFL announced a jersey promotion called Color Rush in which teams would wear uniforms typically of one color head-to-toe during select prime-time games. The promotion was used three times that season; all the games that featured them were on Thursday Night and had both teams wear them in each. The following season, the league released uniforms for all 32 teams and announced they would be worn during all Thursday Night games that year, as well as on Christmas. The Ravens had one Thursday Night game in 2016; they wore their all-purple Color Rush uniforms and won 28–7 over the division rival Cleveland Browns. They had one other Thursday night game the following season, in which they again wore the jerseys and won 40–0 over the Miami Dolphins. In their Christmas 2016 game against the Steelers, the Ravens wore their regular all-white uniforms while their rivals wore their Color Rush uniforms. Starting in 2024, the Ravens would wear alternate purple helmets with the Color Rush uniform, featuring a new front-facing Ravens logo as the helmet decals. The full set was rebranded as the &quot;Purple Rising&quot; uniforms.

On September 13, 2018, the Ravens debuted a new combination in a road game against the Cincinnati Bengals, wearing white jerseys with purple pants. The purple pants are similar to the ones used for Color Rush except that it has side stripes of black and white; the Color Rush purple pants have gold and white stripes. Then on October 21 against the New Orleans Saints, the Ravens paired their new purple pants with their regular purple uniforms. Black socks were originally worn with this combination, but on January 2, 2022, the Ravens wore purple socks with the regular all-purple combination against the Los Angeles Rams, essentially replicating their Color Rush uniforms but with minimal gold elements.

For the regular season finale against the Browns on December 30, the Ravens wore their black uniforms with purple pants. The Ravens wore this combination again October 11, 2021, against the Indianapolis Colts on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in a 31–25 overtime win.

==Marching band==

The team marching band is called Baltimore&#x27;s Marching Ravens. They began as the Colts&#x27; marching band and have operated continuously from September 7, 1947, to the present. They helped campaign for football to return to Baltimore after the Colts moved. Because they stayed in Baltimore after the Colts left, the band is nicknamed &quot;the band that would not die&quot; and were the subject of an episode of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot;. The Washington Commanders are the only other NFL team that currently has a marching band.

===Current roster===
===Pro Football Hall of Fame===

Note: The following lists inductees of the Hall of Fame who spent portions of their careers with the Ravens. Bold number indicates player inducted primarily for their contributions to the franchise. For other Hall of Famers, players whose numbers were retired, and players who played for the Baltimore Colts, see Indianapolis Colts. For Cleveland Browns players, including those in the Hall of Fame and those whose numbers were retired, see Cleveland Browns.

===Retired numbers===
The Ravens do not have officially retired numbers. However, the number 19 has not been issued out of respect for Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, except for quarterback Scott Mitchell in his lone season in Baltimore in 1999. In addition, numbers 75, 52, 20, 55, and 73 in honor of Jonathan Ogden, Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Terrell Suggs, and Marshal Yanda respectively, have not been issued since those players&#x27; retirements from football.

===Ring of Honor===
The Ravens have a &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; which is on permanent display encircling the field of M&amp;T Bank Stadium. The ring currently honors 20 members, including eight former members of the Baltimore Colts.

Key/Legend


==First-round draft picks==

The team&#x27;s first draft was the 1996 NFL draft, where they selected UCLA offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden fourth overall and University of Miami linebacker Ray Lewis 24th overall. Both players won a Super Bowl with the team, earned numerous Pro Bowl and All-Pro selections, and are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Along with their pick in the next year&#x27;s draft, this was the highest first-round draft pick that the Ravens have had. In 1996, 2000, 2003, 2018, 2021 and 2022, the Ravens had two first-round draft picks. In 2004, 2010, and 2012, they had none. Two of their first round picks have made at least ten Pro Bowls.

<doc id="4294" wikidata="Q161269" url="?curid=4294" title="British National Party">
<text>The British National Party (BNP) is a far-right, fascist political party in the United Kingdom. It is headquartered in Wigton, Cumbria, and is led by Adam Walker. A minor party, it has no elected representatives at any level of UK government. The party was founded in 1982, and reached its greatest level of success in the 2000s, when it had over fifty seats in local government, one seat on the London Assembly, and two Members of the European Parliament. It has been largely inactive since 2019.

Taking its name from that of a defunct 1960s far-right party, the BNP was created by John Tyndall and other former members of the fascist National Front (NF). During the 1980s and 1990s, the BNP placed little emphasis on contesting elections, in which it did poorly. Instead, it focused on street marches and rallies, creating the Combat 18 paramilitary—its name a coded reference to Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler—to protect its events from anti-fascist protesters. A growing &#x27;moderniser&#x27; faction was frustrated by Tyndall&#x27;s leadership, and ousted him in 1999. The new leader Nick Griffin sought to broaden the BNP&#x27;s electoral base by presenting a more moderate image, targeting concerns about rising immigration rates, and emphasising localised community campaigns. This resulted in increased electoral growth throughout the 2000s, to the extent that it became the most electorally successful far-right party in British history. Concerns regarding financial mismanagement resulted in Griffin being removed as leader in 2014. By this point, the BNP&#x27;s membership and vote share had declined dramatically, groups like Britain First and National Action had splintered off, and the English Defence League had supplanted it as the UK&#x27;s foremost far-right group.

Ideologically positioned on the extreme-right or far-right of British politics, the BNP has been characterised as fascist or neo-fascist by political scientists. Under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership, it was more specifically regarded as neo-Nazi. The party is ethnic nationalist, and it once espoused the view that only white people should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls for an end to non-white migration into the UK. It called initially for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites but, since 1999, it has advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes biological racism and the white genocide conspiracy theory, calling for global racial separatism and condemning interracial relationships. Under Tyndall, the BNP emphasised anti-semitism and Holocaust denial, promoting the conspiracy theory that Jews seek to dominate the world through both communism and international capitalism. Under Griffin, the party&#x27;s focus switched from anti-semitism towards Islamophobia. It promotes economic protectionism, Euroscepticism, and a transformation away from liberal democracy, while its social policies oppose feminism, LGBT rights, and societal permissiveness.

Operating around a highly centralised structure that gave its chair near total control, the BNP built links with far-right parties across Europe and created various sub-groups, including a record label and trade union. The BNP attracted most support from within White British working-class communities in northern and eastern England, particularly among middle-aged and elderly men. A poll in the 2000s suggested that most Britons favoured a ban on the party. It faced much opposition from anti-fascists, religious organisations, the mainstream media, and most politicians, and BNP members were banned from various professions.

== History ==

=== John Tyndall&#x27;s leadership (1982–1999) ===

The British National Party (BNP) was founded by the extreme-right political activist John Tyndall. Tyndall had been involved in neo-Nazi groups since the late 1950s before leading the far-right National Front (NF) throughout most of the 1970s. Following an argument with senior party member Martin Webster, he resigned from the NF in 1980. In June 1980 Tyndall established a rival, the New National Front (NNF). At the recommendation of Ray Hill—who was secretly an anti-fascist spy seeking to sow disharmony among Britain&#x27;s far-right—Tyndall decided to unite an array of extreme-right groups as a single party. To this end, Tyndall established a Committee for Nationalist Unity (CNU) in January 1982. In March 1982, the CNU held a conference at the Charing Cross Hotel in London, at which 50 far-right activists agreed to the formation of the BNP.

The BNP was formally launched on 7 April 1982 at a press conference in Victoria. Led by Tyndall, most of its early members came from the NNF, although others were defectors from the NF, British Movement, British Democratic Party, and Nationalist Party. Tyndall remarked that there was &quot;scarcely any difference [between the BNP and NF] in ideology or policy save in the minutest detail&quot;, and most of the BNP&#x27;s leading activists had formerly been senior NF figures. Under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership the party was neo-Nazi in orientation and engaged in nostalgia for Nazi Germany. It adopted the NF&#x27;s tactic of holding street marches and rallies, believing that these boosted morale and attracted new recruits. Their first march took place in London on St. George&#x27;s Day 1982. These marches often involved clashes with anti-fascist protesters and resulted in multiple arrests, helping to cement the BNP&#x27;s association with political violence and older fascist groups in the public eye. As a result, BNP organisers began to favour indoor rallies, although street marches continued to be held throughout the mid-to-late 1980s.

In its early years, the BNP&#x27;s involvement in elections was &quot;irregular and intermittent&quot;, and for its first two decades it faced consistent electoral failure. It suffered from low finances and few personnel, and its leadership was aware that its electoral viability was weakened by the anti-immigration rhetoric of Conservative Party Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In the 1983 general election the BNP stood 54 candidates, although it only campaigned in five seats. Although it was able to air its first party political broadcast, it averaged a vote share of 0.06% in the seats it contested.
After the Representation of the People Act 1985 raised the electoral deposit to £500, the BNP adopted a policy of &quot;very limited involvement&quot; in elections. It abstained in the 1987 general election, and stood only 13 candidates in the 1992 general election. In a 1993 local by-election the BNP gained one council seat—won by Derek Beackon in the East London district of Millwall—after a campaign that played to local whites who were angry at the perceived preferential treatment received by Bangladeshi migrants in social housing. Following an anti-BNP campaign launched by local religious groups and the Anti-Nazi League, it lost this seat during the 1994 local elections. In the 1997 general election, it contested 55 seats and gained an average 1.4% of the vote.

In the early 1990s, the paramilitary group Combat 18 (C18) was formed to protect BNP events from anti-fascists. In 1992, C18 carried out attacks on left-wing targets like an anarchist bookshop and the headquarters of the &quot;Morning Star&quot;. Tyndall was angered by C18&#x27;s growing influence on the BNP&#x27;s street activities, and by August 1993, C18 activists were physically clashing with other BNP members. In December 1993, Tyndall issued a bulletin to BNP branches declaring C18 to be a proscribed organisation, furthermore suggesting that it may have been established by agents of the state to discredit the party. To counter the group&#x27;s influence among militant British nationalists, he secured the American white nationalist militant William Pierce as a guest speaker at the BNP&#x27;s annual rally in November 1995.

In the early 1990s, a &quot;moderniser&quot; faction emerged within the party, favouring a more electorally palatable strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections. It was impressed by the electoral gains made by a number of extreme-right parties in continental Europe — such as Jörg Haider&#x27;s Austrian Freedom Party and Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s National Front — which had been achieved by both switching focus from biological racism to the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups and by replacing anti-democratic platforms with populist ones. 
The modernisers called for community campaigns among the white working-class populations of London&#x27;s East End, and Northern England. While the modernisers gained some concessions from the party&#x27;s hard-liners, Tyndall opposed many of their ideas and sought to stem their growing influence. In his view, &quot;we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves in order to make our features more appealing to the public&quot;.

=== Nick Griffin&#x27;s leadership (1999–2014) ===
After the BNP&#x27;s poor performance at the 1997 general election, opposition to Tyndall&#x27;s leadership grew. The modernisers called the party&#x27;s first leadership election, and in October 1999 Tyndall was ousted when two-thirds of those voting backed Nick Griffin, who offered an improved administration, financial transparency, and greater support for local branches. Often characterised as a political chameleon, Griffin had once been considered a party hardliner before switching allegiance to the modernisers in the late 1990s. In his youth, he had been involved in the NF as well as Third Positionist groups like Political Soldier and the International Third Position. Criticising his predecessors for fuelling the image of the BNP as &quot;thugs, losers and troublemakers&quot;, Griffin inaugurated a period of change in the party.

Influenced by Le Pen&#x27;s National Front in France, Griffin sought to widen the BNP&#x27;s appeal to individuals who were concerned about immigration but had not previously voted for the extreme-right. The BNP replaced Tyndall&#x27;s policy of compulsory deportation of non-whites to a voluntary system whereby non-whites would be given financial incentives to emigrate. It downplayed biological racism and stressed the cultural incompatibility of different racial groups. This emphasis on culture allowed it to foreground Islamophobia; following the September 11 attacks in 2001, it launched a &quot;Campaign Against Islam&quot;. It stressed the claim that the BNP was &quot;&quot;not&quot; a racist party&quot; but an &quot;organised response to anti-white racism&quot;. At the same time Griffin sought to reassure the party&#x27;s base that these reforms were based on pragmatism and not a change in principle.

Griffin also sought to shed the BNP&#x27;s image as a single-issue party, by embracing a diverse array of social and economic issues. Griffin renamed the party&#x27;s monthly newspaper from &quot;British Nationalist&quot; to &quot;The Voice of Freedom&quot;, and established a new journal, &quot;Identity&quot;. The party developed community-based campaigns, through which it targeted local issues, particularly in those areas with large numbers of skilled white working-class people who were disaffected with the Labour Party government. For instance, in Burnley it campaigned for lower speed limits on housing estates and against the closure of a local swimming bath, while in South Birmingham it targeted pensioners&#x27; concerns about youth gangs. In 2006, the party urged its activists to carry out local activities like cleaning up children&#x27;s play areas and removing graffiti while wearing high-vis jackets emblazoned with the party logo.

Griffin believed that Peak Oil and a growth in Third World migrants arriving in Britain would result in a BNP government coming to power by 2040. 
The close of the twentieth century produced more favourable conditions for the extreme-right in Britain as a result of increased public concerns about immigration and established Muslim communities coupled with growing dissatisfaction with the established mainstream parties. In turn, the BNP gained rapidly growing levels of support over the coming years. In July 2000, it came second in the council elections for the North End of the London Borough of Bexley, its best result since 1993. At the 2001 general election it gained 16% of the vote in one constituency and over 10% in two others. In the 2002 local elections the BNP gained four councillors, three of whom were in Burnley, where it had capitalised on white anger surrounding the disproportionately high levels of funding being directed to the Asian-dominated Daneshouse ward. This breakthrough generated public anxieties about the party, with a poll finding that six in ten supported a ban on it. In the 2003 local elections, the BNP gained 13 additional councillors, including seven more in Burnley; the party received over 100,000 votes in this election. Concerned that much of its potential vote was going to the UK Independence Party (UKIP), in 2003 the BNP offered UKIP an electoral pact but was rebuffed. Griffin then accused UKIP of being a Labour Party scheme to steal the BNP&#x27;s votes. It invested much in the campaign for the 2004 European Parliament election, at which it received 800,000 votes but failed to secure a parliamentary seat. In the 2004 local elections, it secured four more seats, including three in Epping.
For the 2005 general election, the BNP expanded its number of candidates to 119 and targeted specific regions. Its average vote in the areas it contested rose to 4.3%. It gained significantly more support in three seats, achieving 10% in Burnley, 13% in Dewsbury, and 17% in Barking. In the 2006 local elections the party gained 220,000 votes, with 33 additional councillors, having averaged a vote share of 18% in the areas it contested. In Barking and Dagenham, it saw 12 of its 13 candidates elected to the council. At the 2008 London Assembly election, the BNP gained 130,000 votes, reaching the 5% mark and thus gaining an Assembly seat. At the 2009 European Parliament election, the party gained almost 1 million votes, with two of its candidates, Nick Griffin and Andrew Brons, being elected as Members of the European Parliament for North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber respectively. That election also saw extreme-right parties winning seats for various other EU member-states. This victory marked a major watershed for the party. Amid significant public controversy, Griffin was invited to appear on the BBC show &quot;Question Time&quot; in October 2009, the first time that the BNP had been invited to share a national television platform with mainstream panellists. Griffin&#x27;s performance was however widely regarded as poor.

Despite its success, there was dissent in the party. In 2007 a group of senior members known as the &quot;December rebels&quot; challenged Griffin, calling for internal party democracy and financial transparency, but were expelled. In 2008, a group of BNP activists in Bradford split to form the Democratic Nationalists. In November 2008, the BNP membership list was posted to WikiLeaks, after appearing briefly on a weblog. A year later, in October 2009, another list of BNP members was leaked.

Eddy Butler then led a challenge to Griffin&#x27;s leadership, alleging financial corruption, but he had insufficient support. The rebels who supported him split into two groups: one section remained as the internal Reform Group, the other left the BNP to form the British Freedom Party.
By 2010, there was discontent among the party&#x27;s grassroots, a result of the change to its white-only membership policy and rumours of financial corruption among its leadership. Some defected to the National Front or left to form parties like the Britannica Party. Anti-fascist groups like Hope not Hate had campaigned extensively in Barking to stop the area&#x27;s locals voting for the BNP. At the 2010 general election, the BNP had hoped to make a breakthrough by gaining a seat in the House of Commons, although it failed to achieve this. It nevertheless gained the fifth largest national vote share, with 1.9% of the vote, representing the most successful electoral performance for an extreme-right party in UK history. In the 2010 local elections, it lost all of its councillors in Barking and Dagenham. Nationally, the party&#x27;s number of councillors dropped from over fifty to 28. Griffin described the results as &quot;disastrous&quot;.

=== Decline (2014–present) ===
In a 2011 leadership election, Griffin secured a narrow victory, beating Brons by nine votes of a total of 2,316 votes cast. In October 2012, Brons left the party, leaving Griffin as its sole MEP. In the 2012 local elections, the party lost all of its seats and saw its vote share fall dramatically; whereas it gained over 240,000 votes in 2008, this had fallen to under 26,000 by 2012. Commenting on the result, the political scientist Matthew Goodwin noted: &quot;Put simply, the BNP&#x27;s electoral challenge is over.&quot; In the 2012 London mayoral election, the BNP candidate came seventh, with 1.3% of first-preference votes, its poorest showing in the London mayoral contest. The 2012 election results established that the BNP&#x27;s steady growth had ended. In the 2013 local elections, the BNP fielded 99 candidates but failed to win any council seats, leaving it with only two.

In June 2013, Griffin visited Syria along with members of Hungarian far-right party Jobbik to meet with government officials, including the Speaker of the Syrian People&#x27;s Assembly, Mohammad Jihad al-Laham, and the Prime Minister Wael Nader al-Halqi. Griffin claims he was influential in the speaker of Syria&#x27;s Parliament writing an open letter to British MPs urging them to &quot;turn Great Britain from the warpath&quot; by not intervening in the Syrian conflict. Griffin lost his European Parliament seat in the May 2014 European election. The party blamed the UK Independence Party for its decline, accusing the latter of stealing BNP policies and slogans. In July 2014, Griffin resigned and was succeeded by Adam Walker as acting chairman. In October, Griffin was expelled from the party for &quot;trying to cause disunity [in the party] by deliberately fabricating a state of crisis&quot;.

In January 2015, membership of the party numbered 500, down from 4,220 in December 2013. At the general election in 2015, the BNP fielded eight candidates, down from 338 in 2010. The party&#x27;s vote share declined 99.7% from its 2010 result. In January 2016, the Electoral Commission de-registered the BNP for failing to pay its annual registration fee of £25. At this time, it was estimated that BNP assets totalled less than £50,000. According to the commission, &quot;BNP candidates cannot, at present, use the party&#x27;s name, descriptions or emblems on the ballot paper at elections.&quot; A month later, the party was re-registered. There were ten BNP candidates at the general election in 2017. At the 2018 local elections, the party&#x27;s last remaining councillor—Brian Parker of Pendle—decided not to stand for re-election, leaving the party without representation at any level of UK government. The BNP fielded only one candidate, David Furness, at the 2019 general election in Hornchurch and Upminster, where he came last.

The BNP has been essentially inactive since 2019, and has not put forward a single candidate in any elections since 2019, with the only evidence of any activity being the occasional post on its website or Twitter account.

== Ideology ==
===Far-right politics, fascism and neo-Nazism===
Many academic historians and political scientists have described the BNP as a far-right party, or as an extreme-right party. As the political scientist Matthew Goodwin used it, the term referred to &quot;a particular form of political ideology that is defined by two anti-constitutional and anti-democratic elements: first, right-wing extremists are &quot;extremist&quot; because they reject or undermine the values, procedures and institutions of the democratic constitutional state; and second they are &quot;right-wing&quot; because they reject the principle of fundamental human equality&quot;.

Various political scientists and historians have described the BNP as being fascist in ideology. Others have instead described it as neo-fascist, a term which the historian Nigel Copsey argued was more exact. Academic observers—including the historians Copsey, Graham Macklin, and Roger Griffin, and the political theologian Andrew P. Davey—have argued that Nick Griffin&#x27;s reforms were little more than a cosmetic process to obfuscate the party&#x27;s fascist roots. According to Copsey, under Griffin the BNP was &quot;fascism recalibrated—a form of neo-fascism—to suit contemporary sensibilities&quot;. Macklin noted that despite Griffin&#x27;s &#x27;modernisation&#x27; project, the BNP retained its ideological continuity with earlier fascist groups and thus had not transformed itself into a genuinely &quot;post-fascist&quot; party. In this it was distinct from parties like the Italian National Alliance of Gianfranco Fini, which has been credited with successfully shedding its fascist past and becoming post-fascist.

In 1995, the anti-fascist activist Gerry Gable referred to the BNP as a &quot;Nazi organisation&quot;, while the Anti-Nazi League published leaflets describing the BNP as the &quot;British Nazi Party&quot;. Copsey suggested that while the BNP under Tyndall could be described as neo-Nazi, it was not &quot;crudely mimetic&quot; of the original German Nazism. Davey characterised the BNP as a &quot;populist ethno-nationalist&quot; party.

In his writings, Griffin acknowledged that much of his &#x27;modernisation&#x27; was an attempt to hide the BNP&#x27;s core ideology behind more electorally palatable policies. Like the National Front, the BNP&#x27;s private discourse differed from its public one, with Griffin stating that &quot;Of course we must teach the truth to the hardcore ... [but] when it comes to influencing the public, forget about racial differences, genetics, Zionism, historical revisionism and so on ... we must at all times present them with an image of moderate reasonableness&quot;. The BNP has eschewed the labels &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;Nazi&quot;, stating that it is neither. In its 1992 electoral manifesto, it said that &quot;Fascism was Italian. Nazism was German. We are British. We will do things our own way; we will not copy foreigners&quot;. In 2009, Griffin that the term &quot;fascism&quot; was simply &quot;a smear that comes from the far left&quot;; he added that the term should be reserved for groups that engaged in &quot;political violence&quot; and desired a state that &quot;should impose its will on people&quot;, claiming that it was the anti-fascist group Unite Against Fascism—and not the BNP—who were the real fascists. More broadly, many on Britain&#x27;s extreme right sought to avoid the term &quot;British fascism&quot; because of its electorally unpalatable connotations, utilising &quot;British nationalism&quot; in its place.

After Griffin took control of the party, it made increasing use of nativist themes in order to emphasise its &quot;British&quot; credentials. In its published material, the party made appeals to the idea of Britain and Britishness in a manner not dissimilar to mainstream political parties. In this material it has also made prominent use of the Union flag and the colours red, white, and blue. Roger Griffin noted that the terms &quot;Britain&quot; and &quot;England&quot; appear &quot;confusingly interchangeable&quot; in BNP literature, while Copsey has pointed out that the BNP&#x27;s form of British nationalism is &quot;Anglo-centric&quot;. The party employed militaristic rhetoric under both Tyndall and Griffin&#x27;s leadership; under the latter for example its published material spoke of a &quot;war without uniforms&quot; and a &quot;war for our survival as a people&quot;. Tyndall described the BNP as a revolutionary party, calling it a &quot;guerrilla army operating in occupied territory&quot;.

===Ethnic nationalism and biological racism===
The BNP adheres to biological racist ideas, displaying an obsession with the perceived differences of racial groups. Both Tyndall and Griffin believed that there was a biologically distinct white-skinned &quot;British race&quot; which was one branch of a wider Nordic race, a view akin to those of earlier fascists such as Hitler and Arnold Leese.

The BNP adheres to an ideology of ethnic nationalism. It promotes the idea that not all citizens of the United Kingdom belong to the British nation. Instead, it states that the nation only belongs to &quot;the English, Scots, Irish and Welsh along with the limited numbers of peoples of European descent, who have arrived centuries or decades ago and who have fully integrated into our society&quot;. This is a group that Griffin referred to as the &quot;home people&quot; or &quot;the folk&quot;. According to Tyndall, &quot;The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism.&quot; Richard Edmonds in 1993 told &quot;The Guardian&quot; Duncan Campbell that &quot;we [the BNP] are 100% racist&quot;. The BNP does not regard UK citizens who are not ethnic white Europeans as &quot;British&quot;, and party literature calls on supporters to avoid referring to such individuals as &quot;Black Britons&quot; or &quot;Asian Britons&quot;, instead describing them as &quot;racial foreigners&quot;.
Tyndall believed the white British and the broader Nordic race to be superior to other races; under his leadership, the BNP promoted pseudoscientific claims in support of white supremacy. Following Griffin&#x27;s ascendency to power in the party, it officially repudiated racial supremacism and insisted that no racial group was superior or inferior to another. Instead it foregrounded an &quot;ethno-pluralist&quot; racial separatism, claiming that different racial groups had to be kept separate and distinct for their own preservation, maintaining that global ethno-cultural diversity was something to be protected. This switch in focus owed much to the discourse of the French movement which had emerged within France&#x27;s extreme right during the 1960s. At the same time the BNP switched focus from openly promoting biological racism to stressing what it perceived as the cultural incompatibility of racial groups. It placed great focus on opposing what it referred to as &quot;multiculturalism&quot;, characterising this as a form of &quot;cultural genocide&quot;, and stating that it promoted the interests of non-whites at the expense of the white British population. However, internal documents produced and circulated under Griffin&#x27;s leadership demonstrated that—despite the shift in its public statements—it remained privately committed to biological racist ideas.

The party emphasises what it sees as the need to protect the racial purity of the white British. It condemns miscegenation and &quot;race mixing&quot;, stating that this is a threat to the British race. Tyndall said that he &quot;felt deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage&quot; but had &quot;no sympathy whatsoever for the parents&quot;. Griffin similarly stated that mixed-race children were &quot;the most tragic victims of enforced multi-racism&quot;, and that the party would not &quot;accept miscegenation as moral or normal ... we never will&quot;. In its 1983 election manifesto, the BNP stated that &quot;family size is a private matter&quot; but still called for white Britons who are &quot;of intelligent, healthy and industrious stock&quot; to have large families and thus raise the white British birth rate. The encouragement of high birth rates among white British families continued under Griffin&#x27;s leadership.

Under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership, the BNP promoted eugenics, calling for the forced sterilisation of those with genetically transmittable disabilities. In party literature, it talked of improving the British &#x27;racial stock&#x27; by removing &quot;inferior strains within the indigenous races of the British Isles&quot;. Tyndall argued that medical professionals should be responsible for determining whom to sterilise, while a lowering of welfare benefits would discourage breeding among those he deemed to be genetic inferiors. In his magazine &quot;Spearhead&quot;, Tyndall also stated that &quot;the gas chamber system&quot; should be used to eliminate &quot;sub-human elements&quot;, &quot;perverts&quot;, and &quot;asocials&quot; from British society.

===Anti-immigration and repatriation===

Opposition to immigration has been central to the BNP&#x27;s political platform. It has engaged in xenophobic campaigns which emphasise the idea that immigrants and ethnic minorities are both different from, and a threat to, the white British and white Irish populations. In its campaign material it presented non-whites both as a source of crime in the UK, and as a socio-economic threat to the white British population by taking jobs, housing, and welfare away from them. It engaged in welfare chauvinism, calling for white Britons to be prioritised by the UK&#x27;s welfare state. Party literature included such as claims as that the BNP was the only party which could &quot;do anything effective about the swamping of Britain by the Third World&quot; or &quot;lead the native peoples of Britain in our version of the New Crusade that must be organised if Europe is not to sink under the Islamic yoke&quot;.

Much of its published material made claims about a forthcoming race war and promoted the conspiracy theory about white genocide. In a 2009 radio interview, Griffin referred to this as a &quot;bloodless genocide&quot;. It presents the idea that white Britons are engaged in a battle against their own extinction as a racial group. It reiterated a sense of urgency about the situation, claiming that both high immigration rates and high birth rates among ethnic minorities were a threat to the white British. In 2010, it for instance was promoting the idea that at current levels, &quot;indigenous Britons&quot; would be a minority within the UK by 2060.

The BNP calls for the non-white population of Britain to either be reduced in size or removed from the country altogether. Under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership, it promoted the compulsory removal of non-whites from the UK, stating that under a BNP government they would be &quot;repatriated&quot; to their countries of origin. In the early 1990s it produced stickers with the slogan &quot;Our Final Solution: Repatriation&quot;. Tyndall understood this to be a two-stage process that would take ten to twenty years, with some non-whites initially leaving willingly and the others then being forcibly deported. During the 1990s, party modernisers suggested that the BNP move away from a policy of compulsory repatriation and toward a voluntary system, whereby non-white persons would be offered financial incentives to leave the UK. This idea, adopted from Powellism, was deemed more electorally palatable.

When Griffin took control of the party, the policy of voluntary repatriation was officially adopted, with the party suggesting that this could be financed through the use of the UK&#x27;s pre-existing foreign aid budget. It stated that any non-whites who refused to leave would be stripped of their British citizenship and categorised as &quot;permanent guests&quot;, while continuing to be offered incentives to emigrate. Griffin&#x27;s BNP also stressed its support for an immediate halt to non-white immigration into Britain and for the deportation of any migrants illegally in the country. Speaking on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Marr Show&quot; in 2009, Griffin declared that, unlike Tyndall, he &quot;does not want all-white UK&quot; because &quot;nobody out there wants it or would pay for it&quot;.

=== Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia ===
Under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership, the BNP was openly anti-Semitic. From A. K. Chesterton, Tyndall had inherited a belief that there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, viewing the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, which is known to be a forgery, as genuine evidence for this. He believed that Jews were responsible for both communism and international finance capitalism and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race. He believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of the Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races. In an early edition of &quot;Spearhead&quot; published in the 1960s, Tyndall wrote that &quot;if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about ... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?&quot; Tyndall added Holocaust denial to the anti-Semitic beliefs inherited from Chesterton, believing that the Holocaust was a hoax created by the Jews to gain sympathy for themselves and thus aid their plot for world domination. Among those to endorse such anti-Semitic conspiracy theories was Griffin, who promoted them in his 1997 pamphlet, &quot;Who are the Mind Benders?&quot; Griffin also engaged in Holocaust denial, publishing articles promoting such ideas in &quot;The Rune&quot;, a magazine produced by the Croydon BNP. In 1998, these articles resulted in Griffin being convicted of inciting racial hatred.

When Griffin took power, he sought to banish overt anti-Semitic discourse from the party. He informed party members that &quot;we can get away with criticising Zionists, but any criticism of Jews is likely to be legal and political suicide&quot;. In 2006, he complained that the &quot;obsession&quot; that many BNP members had with &quot;the Jews&quot; was &quot;insane and politically disastrous&quot;. In 2004, the party selected a Jewish candidate, Pat Richardson, to stand for it during local council elections, something Tyndall lambasted as a &quot;gimmick&quot;. References to Jews in BNP literature were often coded to hide the party&#x27;s electorally unpalatable anti-Semitic ideas. For instance, the term &quot;Zionists&quot; was often used in party literature as a euphemism for &quot;Jews&quot;. As noted by Macklin, Griffin still framed many of his arguments &quot;within the parameters of recognizably anti-Semitic discourse&quot;. The BNP&#x27;s literature is replete with references to a conspiratorial group who have sought to suppress nationalist sentiment among the British population, who have encouraged immigration and mixed-race relationships, and who are promoting the Islamification of the country. This group is likely a reference to the Jews, being an old fascist canard.

Sectors of the extreme-right were highly critical of Griffin&#x27;s softening on the subject of the Jews, claiming that he had &quot;sold out&quot; to the &#x27;Zionist Occupied Government&#x27;. In 2006, John Bean, editor of &quot;Identity&quot;, included an article in which he reassured BNP members that the party had not &quot;sold out to the Jews&quot; or &quot;embraced Zionism&quot; but that it remained &quot;committed to fighting ... subversive Jews&quot;. Under Griffin, the BNP&#x27;s website linked to other web pages that explicitly portrayed immigration as part of a Jewish conspiracy, while it also sold books that promoted Holocaust denial. In 2004, secretly filmed footage was captured in which Griffin was seen claiming that &quot;the Jews simply bought the West, in terms of press and so on, for their own political ends&quot;.
Copsey noted that a &quot;culture of anti-Semitism&quot; still pervaded the BNP. In 2004, a London activist told reporters that &quot;most of us hate Jews&quot;, while a Scottish BNP group was observed making Nazi salutes while shouting &quot;Auschwitz&quot;. The party&#x27;s Newcastle upon Tyne Central candidate compared the Auschwitz concentration camp to Disneyland, while their Luton North candidate stated her refusal to buy from &quot;the kikes that run Tesco&quot;. In 2009, a BNP councillor from Stoke-on-Trent resigned from the party, complaining that it still contained Holocaust deniers and Nazi sympathisers.

Griffin informed BNP members that rather than &quot;bang on&quot; about the Jews—which would be deemed extremist and prove electorally unpopular—their party should focus on criticising Islam, an issue that would be more resonant among the British public. After Griffin took over, the party increasingly embraced an Islamophobic stance, launching a &quot;Campaign Against Islam&quot; in September 2001. In &quot;Islam: A Threat to Us All&quot;, a leaflet distributed to London households in 2007, the BNP claimed that it would stand up to both Islamic extremism and &quot;the threat that &#x27;mainstream&#x27; Islam poses to our British culture&quot;. In contrast to the mainstream British view that the actions of militant Islamists—such as those who perpetrated the 7 July 2005 London bombings—are not representative of mainstream Islam, the BNP insists that they are. In some of its literature it presents the view that every Muslim in Britain is a threat to the country. Griffin referred to Islam as an &quot;evil, wicked faith&quot;, and elsewhere publicly described it as a &quot;cancer&quot; that needed to be removed from Europe through &quot;chemotherapy&quot;.

The BNP has called for the prohibition of immigration from Muslim countries and for the banning of the burka, halal meat, and the building of new mosques in the UK. It also called for the immediate deportation of radical Islamist preachers from the country. In 2005, the party stated that its primary issue of concern was the &quot;growth of fundamentalist-militant Islam in the UK and its ever-increasing threat to Western civilization and our implicit values&quot;. To broaden its anti-Islamic agenda, Griffin&#x27;s BNP made overtures to the UK&#x27;s Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities; Griffin&#x27;s claim that Jews can make &quot;good allies&quot; in the fight against Islam caused controversy within the international far-right.

===Government===
Tyndall believed that liberal democracy was damaging to British society, stating that liberalism was a &quot;doctrine of decay and degeneration&quot;. Under Tyndall, the party sought to dismantle the UK&#x27;s liberal democratic system of parliamentary governance, although was vague about what it sought to replace this system with. In his 1988 work &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, Tyndall wrote of the need for &quot;an utter rejection of liberalism and a dedication to the resurgence of authority&quot;. Tyndall&#x27;s BNP perceived itself as a revolutionary force that would bring about a national rebirth in Britain, entailing a radical transformation of society. It proposed a state in which the Prime Minister would have full executive powers, and would be elected directly by the population for an indefinite period of time. This Prime Minister could be dismissed from office in a further election that could be called if Parliament produced a vote of no confidence in them. It stated that rather than having political parties, candidates standing for election to the parliament would be independent. During the period of Griffin&#x27;s leadership, the party downplayed its anti-democratic themes and instead foregrounded populist ones. Its campaign material called for the devolution of greater powers to local communities, the reestablishment of county councils, and the introduction of citizens&#x27; initiative referendums based on those used in Switzerland.
The BNP has adopted a hard Eurosceptic platform from its foundation. Under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership, the BNP had overt anti-Europeanist tendencies. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he maintained the party&#x27;s opposition to the European Economic Community. Antagonism toward what became the European Union was retained under Griffin&#x27;s leadership, which called for the UK to leave the Union. One of Vote Leave&#x27;s biggest donors during the Brexit referendum was former BNP member Gladys Bramall, and the party has claimed that its anti-Establishment rhetoric &quot;created the road&quot; to Britain&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union.

Tyndall suggested replacing the EEC with a trading association among the &quot;White Commonwealth&quot;, namely countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Tyndall held imperialist views and was sympathetic to the re-establishment of the British Empire through the recolonization of parts of Africa. However, officially the BNP had no plans to re-establish the British Empire or secure dominion over non-white nations. In the 2000s, it called for an immediate military withdrawal from both the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. During his appearance on &quot;Question Time&quot;, regarding the Iraq War, Griffin described the war as &quot;illegal&quot;, saying, &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t have gone into Iraq, we must never go into Iran, we should leave them alone.&quot; It has advocated ending overseas aid to provide economic support within the UK and to finance the voluntary repatriation of legal immigrants.

Under Tyndall, the BNP rejected both Welsh nationalism and Scottish nationalism, stating that they were bogus because they caused division among the wider &quot;British race&quot;. Tyndall also led the BNP in support of Ulster loyalism, for instance by holding public demonstrations against the Irish republican party Sinn Féin, and endorsing Ulster loyalist paramilitaries. Under Griffin, the BNP continued to support Northern Ireland&#x27;s membership of the United Kingdom, calling for the crushing of the Irish Republican Army and the scrapping of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Griffin later expressed the view that &quot;the only solution that could possibly be acceptable to loyalists and republicans alike&quot; would be the reintegration of the Irish Republic into the United Kingdom, which would be reorganised along federal lines. However, while retaining the party&#x27;s commitment to Ulster loyalism, under Griffin the importance of the issue was downplayed, something that was criticised by Tyndall loyalists.

===Economic policy===
Tyndall described his approach to the economy as &quot;National Economics&quot;, expressing the view that &quot;politics must lead, and not be led by, economic forces&quot;. His approach rejected economic liberalism because it did not serve &quot;the national interest&quot;, although still saw advantages in a capitalist system, looking favourably on individual enterprise. He called on capitalist elements to be combined with socialist ones, with the government playing a role in planning the economy. He promoted the idea of the UK becoming an autarky which was economically self-sufficient, with domestic production protected from foreign competition. This attitude was heavily informed by the corporatist system that had been introduced in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist Italy.

A number of senior members, including Griffin and John Bean, had anti-capitalist leanings, having been influenced by Strasserism and National Bolshevism. Under Griffin&#x27;s leadership, the BNP promoted economic protectionism and opposed globalisation. Its economic policies reflect a vague commitment to distributist economics, ethno-socialism, and national autarky. The BNP maintains a policy of protectionism and economic nationalism, although in comparison with other far-right nationalist parties, the BNP focuses less on corporatism. It has called for British ownership of its own industries and resources and the &quot;subordination of the power of the City to the power of the government&quot;. It has promoted the regeneration of farming in the United Kingdom, with the object of achieving maximum self-sufficiency in food production. In 2002, the party criticised corporatism as a &quot;mixture of big capitalism and state control&quot;, saying it favoured a &quot;distributionist tradition established by home-grown thinkers&quot; favouring small business. The BNP has also called for the renationalisation of the railways. The BNP, in its 2010 manifesto, called for Britain to emulate the &quot;tiger states&quot; of East Asia, such as South Korea and Singapore.

When it comes to environmentalism, the BNP refers to itself as the &quot;real green party&quot;, stating that the Green Party of England and Wales engages in &quot;watermelon&quot; politics by being green (environmentalist) on the outside but red (leftist) on the inside. Influenced by the Nouvelle Droite, it framed its arguments regarding environmentalism in an anti-immigration manner, talking about the need for &#x27;sustainability&#x27;. It engages in climate change denial, with Griffin claiming that global warming is a hoax orchestrated by those trying to establish the New World Order.

===Social issues===

The BNP is opposed to feminism and has pledged that—if in government—it would introduce financial incentives to encourage women to leave employment and become housewives. It would also seek to discourage children being born out of wedlock. It has stated that it would criminalise abortion, except in cases where the child has been conceived as a result of rape, the mother&#x27;s life is threatened, or the child will be disabled. There are nevertheless circumstances where it has altered this anti-abortion stance; an article in &quot;British Nationalist&quot; stated that a white woman bearing the child of a black man should &quot;abort the pregnancy ... for the good of society&quot;. More widely, the party censures inter-racial sex and accuses the British media of encouraging inter-racial relationships.

Under Tyndall, the BNP called for the re-criminalisation of homosexual activity. Following Griffin&#x27;s takeover, it moderated its policy on homosexuality. However, it opposed the 2004 introduction of civil partnerships for same-sex couples. During his 2009 &quot;Question Time&quot; appearance, Griffin described the sight of two men kissing as &quot;for a lot of us (Christians) ... really creepy&quot;. The party has also condemned the availability of pornography; its 1992 manifesto stated that the BNP would give the &quot;pedlars of this filth ... the criminal status that they deserve&quot;. The BNP promoted the reintroduction of capital punishment, and the sterilisation of some criminals. It also called for the reintroduction of national service in the UK, adding that on completion of this service adults would be permitted to keep their standard issue assault rifle.

According to the academic Steven Woodbridge, the BNP had a &quot;rather ambivalent attitude toward Christian belief and religious themes in general&quot; during most of its history, but under Griffin&#x27;s modernisation the party increasingly utilised Christian terminology and themes in its discourse. Various members of the party presented themselves as &quot;true Christians&quot;, and defenders of the faith, with key ideologues stating that the religion has been &quot;betrayed&quot; and &quot;sold out&quot; by mainstream clergy and the British establishment. British Christianity, the BNP said, was under threat from Islam, Marxism, multiculturalism, and &quot;political correctness&quot;. On analysing the BNP&#x27;s use of Christianity, Davey argued that the party&#x27;s emphasis was not on Christian faith itself, but on the inheritance of European Christian culture.

The BNP long considered the mainstream media to be one of its major impediments to electoral success. Tyndall said that the media represents a &quot;state above the state&quot; which was committed to the &quot;left-liberal&quot; goals of internationalism, liberal democracy, and racial integration. The party has said that the mainstream media has given disproportionate coverage to the achievements of ethnic minority sportsmen and to the victims of anti-black racism while ignoring white victims of racial prejudice and the BNP&#x27;s activities. Both Tyndall and Griffin have said that the mainstream media is controlled by Jews, who use it for their own devices; the latter promoted this idea in his &quot;Who are the Mind Benders?&quot; Griffin has described the BBC as &quot;a thoroughly unpleasant, ultra-leftist establishment&quot;. The BNP has stated that if it took power, it would end &quot;the dictatorship of the media over free debate&quot;. It said that it would introduce a law prohibiting the media from disseminating falsehoods about an individual or organisation for financial or political gain, and that it would ban the media from promoting racial integration.
BNP policy pledges to protect freedom of speech, as part of which it would repeal all laws banning racial or religious hate speech. It would repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.

=== Voter base ===
Goodwin described the BNP&#x27;s voters as being &quot;socially distinct and concerned about a specific set of issues&quot;. Under Griffin&#x27;s leadership, the party targeted areas with high proportions of skilled white working-class voters, particularly those who were disenchanted with the Labour government. It has attempted to appeal to disaffected Labour voters with slogans such as &quot;We are the Labour Party your Grandfather Voted For&quot;. The BNP had little success in gaining support from women, the middle classes, and the more educated.

Goodwin noted a &quot;strong male bias&quot; in the party&#x27;s support base, with statistical polling revealing that between 2002 and 2006, seven out of ten BNP voters were male. That same research also indicated that BNP voters were disproportionately middle-aged and elderly, with three quarters being aged over 35, and only 11% aged between 18 and 24. This contrasted to the NF&#x27;s support base during the 1970s, when 40% of its voters were aged between 18 and 24. Goodwin suggested two possibilities for the BNP&#x27;s failure to appeal to younger voters: one was the &#x27;life cycle effect&#x27;, that older people have obtained more during their life and thus have more to lose, feeling both more threatened by change and more socially conservative in their views. The other explanation was the &#x27;generational effect&#x27;, with younger Britons who have grown up since the onset of mass immigration having had greater social exposure to ethnic minorities and thus being more tolerant toward them. Conversely, many older voters came of age during the 1970s, under the impact of the anti-immigrant rhetoric promoted by Powellism, Thatcherism, and the NF, and thus have less tolerant attitudes.

Most BNP voters had no formal qualifications and the party&#x27;s support was centred largely in areas with low educational attainment. According to the 2002–2006 data, two-thirds of BNP voters had either no formal qualifications or had left education after their O-levels/GCSEs. Only one in ten BNP voters possessed an A-level, and an even smaller percentage had a university degree. Most of the BNP&#x27;s voting base were from the financially insecure lower classes. Research conducted from 2002 to 2006 indicated that seven out of ten BNP voters were either skilled or unskilled workers or unemployed. A 2009 poll found that six out of ten BNP voters fitted this profile. Goodwin suggested that it was the skilled working classes rather than their unskilled or unemployed neighbours who were the main support base behind the BNP, because they owned some assets and thus felt that they had more to lose as a result of the economic threat posed by immigrants and ethnic minorities.

Research indicated that BNP voters also held opinions that were distinct from the average British citizen. They were far more pessimistic about their economic prospects than average, with seven out of ten BNP voters expecting their economic prospects to decline in future, contrasted with four out of ten who held this view in the wider population. In the 2002–2006 period, 59% of BNP voters considered immigration to be the most important issue facing the UK, compared with only 16% of the wider population who agreed. By 2009, 87% of BNP voters identified immigration and asylum as the most important issue, to 49% of the wider population. BNP voters were also more likely to identify law and order, the EU, and Islamic extremism as the most important issues facing the UK than other voters, and less likely than average to rate the economy, NHS, pensions, and housing market as the most important.

BNP voters were also more likely than average to believe both that white Britons face unfair discrimination, and that Muslims, non-whites, and homosexuals had unfair advantages in British society. 78% of BNP voters endorsed the belief that the Labour Party prioritised immigrants and ethnic minorities over white British people, to 44% of the wider population. When asked questions about immigration and Muslims, BNP voters were found to be far more hostile to them than the average Briton, and also more willing than average to support outright racially discriminatory policies toward them. Copsey believed that &quot;popular racism&quot;—namely against asylum seekers and Muslims—generated the BNP&#x27;s &quot;largest reservoir of support&quot;, and that in many Northern English towns the main factors behind BNP support were white resentment toward Asian communities, anger at Asian-on-white crime, and the perception that Asians received disproportionately high levels of public funding.

Research also indicated that BNP voters were more mistrustful of the establishment than average citizens. In 2002–2006, 92% of BNP voters described themselves as being dissatisfied with the government, to 62% of the wider population. Over 80% of BNP voters were found to distrust their local Member of Parliament, council officials, and civil servants, and were also more likely than average to think that politicians were personally corrupt. There was also a tendency for BNP voters to read tabloids like the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Daily Express&quot;, and &quot;The Sun&quot;, all of which promote anti-immigration sentiment. Whether these voters gained such sentiment as a result of reading these tabloids or they read these tabloids because it endorsed their pre-existing views is unclear.

The early stronghold of the BNP was in London, where it established enclaves of support in the boroughs of Enfield, Hackney, Lewisham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets, with smaller units in Bexley, Camden, Greenwich, Hillingdon, Lambeth and Redbridge. By the late 1990s, the party was increasingly retreating from its original East End heartland, finding that its electoral support had declined in the area. Griffin expressed the view that it was too dangerous for BNP activists to campaign in the East End, suggesting that they would be likely to be attacked by opponents. Instead, the party shifted its focus to parts of Outer London, in particular the boroughs of Barking, Bexley, Dagenham, Greenwich and Havering. After Griffin took power, the party focused on building support in the North of England, taking advantage of the anxieties generated by the ethnic riots that took place in Bradford, Oldham and Burnley in 2001. In the period between 2002 and 2006, over 40% of the BNP&#x27;s voters were in Northern England.

The decline of the BNP as an electoral force around 2014 helped to open the way for the growth of another right-wing party, UKIP. In a study Goodwin produced with Robert Ford, the two political scientists noted that UKIP&#x27;s support base mirrored the BNP&#x27;s in that it had the same &quot;very clear social profile&quot;: the &quot;old, male, working class, white and less educated&quot;. One area where the two differed, they noted, was in the fact that BNP support had been highest among the middle-aged before tailing off among the over 55s, whereas UKIP retained strong support with those over 55. Ford and Goodwin suggested that this might be because more over 55s had &quot;direct or indirect experiences&quot; of the Second World War, in which Britain defeated the fascist powers, resulting in them being less inclined to support fascist parties than their younger counterparts. Despite these commonalities, UKIP proved far more successful at mobilising these social groups than did the BNP. This was likely in part because UKIP had a &quot;reputational shield&quot;; it emerged from within the Eurosceptic tradition of British politics rather than from the far-right and thus, while often ridiculed by the mainstream, was regarded as a legitimate democratic actor in a way that the BNP was not.

== Organisation ==
=== Structure ===
On its formation, the BNP avoided the National Front&#x27;s committee-rule system of collective leadership in the hope of evading the infighting and factionalism that had damaged the NF. Instead it was founded around what it called the &quot;leadership principle&quot;, with a central chairman having complete control over the party, which was then arranged in a highly hierarchical structure. The BNP lacked internal democracy, with the grassroots membership having almost no formal power, except for electing the party leader. On taking power, Griffin retained the leadership principle inherited from Tyndall. He nevertheless established an Advisory Council which would meet several times a year; the members were to be selected by Griffin himself and would serve as his advisors.

The party&#x27;s branches and local groups were referred to as &quot;units&quot; within the party. These were designed to recruit followers, raise funds, and campaign during elections. Under Tyndall, the party operated with a skeleton organisation. It had no full-time staff and for most of the 1980s lacked a telephone number. Instead it relied on a handful of geographically scattered, unpaid regional organisers. Its early activists were recruited from within the extreme-right movement, and thus lacked the experience and skills in electoral campaigning. When Griffin took control, he introduced a variety of internal departments to help manage the party&#x27;s activities: the administration and enquiries department, department for group development, legal affairs department, security department, and communications department. Griffin tried to build a more professional party machine by educating and training BNP members, providing them with incentives, establishing a steady income stream, and overcoming factionalism and dissent. He launched an &quot;annual college&quot; for activists in 2001 and formed an education and training department in 2007. In 2008 and 2010, he oversaw the establishment of &quot;summer schools&quot; for high-ranking officials. The party also began employing full-time members of staff, having three in 2001 and 13 in 2007.

To incentivise members to remain committed to the party, Griffin followed the example of the Swedish National Democrats by implementing a new &quot;voting membership&quot; scheme in 2007. This meant that those who had been BNP members for two years could become a &quot;voting member&quot;, at which they would go on a year&#x27;s probation. During this year they were required to attend educational and training seminars, to engage in a certain amount of activism and to donate a specified amount of money to the party. Once completed, they were allowed to vote on certain matters at general members&#x27; meetings and annual conferences, to participate in policy debates, and to be eligible for intermediate and senior positions. This policy ensured that those who reached the higher echelons of the BNP were fully trained in the party&#x27;s ideology and electoral strategy.

===Sub-groups and propaganda output===
Griffin hoped to build a wider social movement around the BNP by establishing affiliated networks and organisations. In many cases, these were presented to the public in a way that concealed any direct connection to the BNP. Most of these affiliated groups were poorly funded and had few members. The party established its own record label, Great White Records, a radio station, and a trade union known as Solidarity – The Union for British Workers. It formed a group for young people known as the Young BNP, although in 2010 renamed this group as the BNP Crusaders, &quot;to pay homage to our ancestors from the Middle Ages who saved Christian Europe from the onslaught of Islam&quot;. It established a Land and People group to recruit support in rural areas, a Family Circle to recruit women and families, and both a Veterans Group and an Association of British ex-Servicemen for former military servicemen. A group called Families Against Immigrant Racism was established to counter perceived racism against white Britons, while an Ethnic Liaison Committee was created to build links with anti-Muslim Hindu and Sikh groups active in Britain. Another group was the American Friends of the British National Party (AFBNP), set up by Mark Cotterill in 1999 to gain support from sympathisers in the United States. In 2001 it had 100 members, and by 2008 had 107.

A group called Islands of the North Atlantic (IONA) was established to promote the BNP&#x27;s view of British culture and identity. The British Students Association was founded to promote the party&#x27;s views among university students in 2000.
Albion Life Insurance was set up in September 2006 as an insurance brokerage company established on behalf of the BNP to raise funds for its activities. The firm ceased to operate in November 2006. In 2006, the BNP launched the Christian Council of Britain (CCB), a group designed to rival the Muslim Council of Britain and oppose the growing &quot;Islamification&quot; of inner city areas. The CCB was established and run by BNP member Robert West, who claimed to have been ordained by the Apostolic Church, a claim that the church denies. West is a Calvinist and espouses a theology of nations which is influenced by Calvinist theologians like Abraham Kuyper, holding that God wishes every race and nation to remain separate until end time.

Griffin&#x27;s BNP also established an annual Red, White and Blue festival, which was based on the organised by France&#x27;s National Front. The festival brought party activists together and aimed to promote a more family friendly image for the group, although it also provided a venue for white power skinhead bands like Stigger, Nemesis and Warlord. Around 1,000 BNP members attended the party&#x27;s 2001 festival.

Under Griffin&#x27;s leadership, the BNP zealously embraced the use of alternative media to promote itself in a way different from the negative portrayal that featured in the mainstream media. On its website—which had been established in 1995—it created an internet television channel, &#x27;BNPtv&#x27;. It has created blogs that cover different themes without being explicitly political in order to promote the party&#x27;s message. The BNP established an online marketing platform, Excalibur, through which to sell its merchandise. In 2003, the BNP said that it had the most viewed website of a political party in Britain, and by 2011 was claiming to have the most viewed such website in Europe. In September 2007, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper reported that Hitwise, the online competitive intelligence service, said that the BNP website had more hits than any other website of a British political party.

=== Leadership ===
=== Membership ===

For most of its history, the BNP had a whites-only membership policy. In 2009, the state&#x27;s Equality and Human Rights Commission stated that this was a violation of the Race Relations Act 1976 and called on the party to amend its constitution accordingly. Responding to this, in early 2010 members voted to remove the racial restriction to membership, although it is unlikely that many non-whites joined. 
At its creation, the BNP had approximately 1,200 members. By the 1983 general election, this had grown to approximately 2,500, although by 1987 had slumped to 1,000, with no significant further growth until the 21st century. After taking control Griffin began publishing the party&#x27;s membership figures: 2,174 in 2001, 3,487 in 2002, 5,737 in 2003, and 7,916 in 2004. Membership dropped slightly to 6,281 in 2005, but had grown to 9,297 in 2007 and to 10,276 in spring 2010. In 2011, it was noted that this meant that the BNP had experienced the most rapid growth since 2001 of any minor party in the UK.

A party membership list dating from late 2007 was leaked onto the internet by a disgruntled activist, containing the names and addresses of 12,000 members. This included names, addresses and other personal details. People on the list included prison officers (barred from BNP membership), teachers, soldiers, civil servants and members of the clergy. The leaked list indicated that membership was concentrated in particular areas, namely the East Midlands, Essex, and Pennine Lancashire, but with particular clusters in Charnwood, Pendle, and Amber Valley. Many of these areas had long been targeted by extreme-right campaigns, dating back to the NF activity of the 1970s, suggesting that such longstanding activism may have had an effect on levels of BNP membership. This information also revealed that membership was most likely in urban areas with low rates of educational attainment and large numbers of economically insecure people employed in manufacturing, with further correlations to nearby Muslim communities. Following an investigation by Welsh police and the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office, two people were arrested in December 2008 for breach of the Data Protection Act concerning the leak. Matthew Single was subsequently found guilty and fined £200 in September 2009. The &#x27;low&#x27; fine was criticised as an &quot;absolute disgrace&quot; by a BNP spokesman and a detective sergeant involved said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the outcome, stating that people were fearful for their safety. More than 160 complaints were made nationally to police after attacks on BNP members and their property.

The leaked membership list showed that the party was 17.22% female. While women have occupied key positions within the BNP, men dominated at every level of the party. In 2009, over 80% of the party&#x27;s Advisory Council was male and from 2002 to 2009, three-quarters of its councillors were male. The average percentage of female candidates presented at local elections in 2001 was 6%, although this had risen to 16% by 2010. Since 2006, the party had made a point of selecting female candidates, with Griffin stating that this was necessary to &quot;soften&quot; the party&#x27;s image. Goodwin suggested that membership fell into three camps: the &quot;activist old guard&quot; who had previously been involved in the NF during the 1970s, the &quot;political wanderers&quot; who had defected from other parties to the BNP, and the &quot;new recruits&quot; who had joined post-2001 and who had little or no political interest or experience beforehand.

Having performed qualitative research among the BNP by interviewing various members, Goodwin noted that few of those he interviewed &quot;conformed to the popular stereotypes of them being irrational and uninformed crude racists&quot;. He noted that most strongly identified with the working class and claimed to have either been former Labour voters or from a Labour-voting family. None of those interviewed claimed a family background in the ethnic nationalist movement. Instead, he noted that members said that they joined the party as a result of a &quot;profound sense of anxiety over immigration and rising ethno-cultural diversity&quot; in Britain, along with its concomitant impact on &quot;British culture and society&quot;. He noted that among these members, the perceived cultural threat of immigrants and ethnic minorities was given greater prominence than the perceived economic threat that they posed to white Britons. He noted that in his interviews with them, members often framed Islam in particular as a threat to British values and society, expressing the fear that British Muslims wanted to Islamicise the country and eventually impose &quot;sharia&quot; on its population.

=== Finances ===
In contrast to the UK&#x27;s mainstream parties, the BNP received few donations from businesses, wealthy donors, or trade unions. Instead it relied on finances produced by its membership. Under Tyndall, the party operated on a shoestring budget with a lack of transparency; in 1992 it collected £5000 and in 1997 it collected £10,000. It also tried raising money by selling extreme-right literature, and opened a bookshop in Welling in 1989, although this was closed in 1996 after being attacked by anti-fascists and proving too costly to run. In 1992, the party formed a dining club of its wealthier supporters, which was renamed the Trafalgar Club in 2000. By the 1997 general election, it admitted that its expenses had &quot;far out-stripped&quot; its income, and it was appealing for donations to pay off loans it had taken out.

Griffin placed greater emphasis on fundraising; from 2001 through to 2008, the BNP&#x27;s annual turnover increased almost fivefold. Membership subscriptions grew from £35,000 to £166,000, while its donations raised from £38,000 to £660,000. However, expenses also rose as the BNP spent more on its electoral campaigns, and the party reported a financial deficit in 2004 and again in 2005. Between 2007 and 2009, the BNP accumulated debts of £500,000.

=== International affiliations ===
Under Griffin, the BNP forged stronger links with various extreme-right parties elsewhere in Europe, among them France&#x27;s National Front, Germany&#x27;s National Democratic Party (NPD), Sweden&#x27;s National Democrats, and Hungary&#x27;s Jobbik. Griffin unsuccessfully urged the NPD to move away from neo-Nazism and embark on the same &#x27;modernisation&#x27; project that he had taken the BNP. Jean-Marie Le Pen of the French Front National was the guest of honour at an &quot;Anglo-French Patriotic Dinner&quot; held by the BNP in April 2004.
Griffin met leaders of the Hungarian far right party Jobbik to discuss co-operation between the two parties and spoke at a Jobbik party rally in August 2008. In April 2009, Simon Darby, deputy chairman of the BNP, was welcomed with fascist salutes by members of the Italian nationalist Forza Nuova during a trip to Milan. Darby stated that the BNP would look to form an alliance with France&#x27;s Front National in the European Parliament. Following the election of two BNP MEPs in 2009, the following year saw the BNP join with other extreme-right parties to form the Alliance of European National Movements, with Griffin becoming its vice president. The party also had close links with the Historical Review Press, a publisher focused on promoting Holocaust denial.

Britain&#x27;s extreme-right has long faced internal and public divisions. Disgruntled BNP members left the party to found or join a wide range of rivals, among them the British Freedom Party, White Nationalist Party, Nationalist Alliance, Wolf&#x27;s Hook White Brotherhood, British People&#x27;s Party, England First Party, Britain First, Democratic Nationalists, and the New Nationalist Party. Various BNP members were involved in the nascent English Defence League (EDL)—with EDL leader Tommy Robinson having been a former BNP activist—although Griffin proscribed the organisation and condemned it as having been manipulated by &quot;Zionists&quot;. The political scientist Chris Allen noted that the EDL shared much of the BNP&#x27;s ideology, but that its &quot;strategies and actions&quot; were very different, with the EDL favouring street marches over electoral politics. By 2014, both the BNP and EDL were in decline, and Britain First—founded by former BNP members James Dowson and Paul Golding—had risen to prominence. It combined the electoral tactics of the BNP with the street marches of the EDL.

The Steadfast Trust was established as a charity in 2004 with the stated aims of reducing poverty among those of Anglo-Saxon descent and supporting English culture. It has many former and current BNP, NF and British Ku Klux Klan members. It was deregistered as a charity by the Charity Commission in February 2014. In 2014, after Nick Griffin lost the leadership of BNP, he set up British Voice, but before it was launched, he decided to set up a different group, British Unity.

== Electoral performance ==

The BNP has contested seats in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research from Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin shows that BNP support is concentrated among older and less educated working-class men living in the declining industrial towns of the North and Midlands regions, in contrast to previous significant far-right parties like the National Front, which drew support from a younger demographic.

===General elections===
The BNP placed comparatively little emphasis on elections to the British House of Commons, aware that the first past the post voting system was a major obstacle.

The British National Party has contested general elections since 1983. It put forward no candidates for the 2024 general election.

The BNP in the 2001 general election saved five deposits (out of 33 contested seats) and secured its best general election result in Oldham West and Royton (which had recently been the scene of racially motivated rioting between white and Asian youths) where party leader Nick Griffin secured 16% of the vote.

The 2005 general election was considered a major breakthrough by the BNP, as it received 192,746 votes in the 119 constituencies it contested, took a 0.7% share of the overall vote and retained a deposit in 40 of the seats.

The BNP put forward candidates for 338 out of 650 seats for the 2010 general election gaining 563,743 votes (1.9%), finishing in fifth place and failing to win any seats. However, a record of 73 deposits were saved. Party chairman Griffin came third in the Barking constituency, behind Margaret Hodge of Labour and Simon Marcus of the Conservatives, who were first and second respectively. At 14.6%, this was the BNP&#x27;s best result in any of the seats it contested that year.

===Local elections===

The BNP&#x27;s first electoral success came in 1993, when Derek Beackon was returned as a councillor in Millwall, London. He lost his seat in elections the following year. The next BNP success in local elections was not until the 2002 local elections, when three BNP candidates gained seats on the Burnley council. The BNP&#x27;s first councillor for six years was John Haycock, elected as a parish councillor for Bromyard and Winslow in Herefordshire in 2000. Haycock failed to attend any council meetings for six months and was later disqualified from office.

The party had 55 councillors for a time in 2009. After the 2013 local county council elections, the BNP was left with a total of two borough councillors in England.

As of 2011, the BNP had yet to make &quot;a major breakthrough&quot; on local councils.
The BNP&#x27;s councillors usually had &quot;an extremely limited impact on local politics&quot; because they were isolated as individuals or small groups on the council. Councillors from the main parties often disliked their BNP colleagues and deemed having to work alongside them as an affront to dignity and decency.
Questions were often raised as to whether BNP councillors could adequately represent the interests of all of their local constituents. On being elected, Beackon for instance stated that he refused to serve his Asian constituents in Millwall. There were also allegations made that BNP councillors had particularly low attendance at council meetings, although research indicated that this was not the case, with the BNP&#x27;s attendance record being largely average.

There is evidence to suggest that racially and religiously motivated crime increased in those areas where BNP councillors had been elected. For instance, after the 1993 election of Beackon, there was a spike in racist attacks in the borough of Tower Hamlets. BNP members were directly responsible for some of this; the party&#x27;s national organiser Richard Edmonds was sentenced to three months imprisonment for his part in an attack on a black man and his white girlfriend.

===Regional assemblies and parliaments===


BNP lead candidate Richard Barnbrook won a seat in the London Assembly in May 2008, after the party gained 5.3% of the London-wide vote. However, in August 2010, he resigned the party whip and became an independent.

In the 2007 Welsh Assembly elections, the BNP fielded 20 candidates, four in each of the five regional lists, with Nick Griffin standing in the South Wales West region. It did not win any seats, but was the only minor party to have saved deposits in the electoral regions, one in the North Wales region and the other in the South Wales West region. In total the BNP polled 42,197 votes (4.3%).

In the 2011 Welsh Assembly elections, the BNP fielded 20 candidates, four in each of the five regional lists and for the first time 7 candidates were fielded in FPTP constituencies. On the regional lists, the BNP polled 22,610 votes (2.4%), down 1.9% from 2007. In 2 out of the 7 FPTP constituencies contested the BNP saved deposits: (Swansea East and Islwyn).

In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the party fielded 32 candidates, entitling it to public funding and an election broadcast, prompting criticism. The BNP received 24,616 votes (1.2%), no seats were won, nor were any deposits saved. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the BNP fielded 32 candidates in the regional lists. 15,580 votes were polled (0.78%).

The BNP fielded 3 candidates for the first time in three constituencies each in the 2011 Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly elections (Belfast East, East Antrim and South Antrim). 1,252 votes were polled (0.2%), winning no seats for the party.

===European Parliament===

The BNP has taken part in European Parliament elections since 1999, when it received 1.13% of the total vote (102,647 votes).

In the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, the BNP won 4.9% of the vote, making it the sixth biggest party overall, but did not win any seats.

The BNP won two seats in the European Parliament in the 2009 elections. Andrew Brons was elected in the Yorkshire and the Humber regional constituency with 9.8% of the vote. Party chairman Nick Griffin was elected in the North West region, with 8% of the vote. Nationally, the BNP received 6.26%.

The UK government announced in 2009 that the BNP&#x27;s two MEPs would be denied some of the access and information afforded to other MEPs. The BNP would be subject to the &quot;same general principles governing official impartiality&quot; and they would receive &quot;standard written briefings as appropriate from time to time&quot;, but diplomats would not be &quot;proactive&quot; in dealing with the BNP MEPs and that any requests for policy briefings from them would be treated differently and on a discretionary basis.

The BNP did not stand any candidates in the 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom.

== Public profile == 

=== Association with violence ===
The leaders and senior officers of the BNP have criminal convictions for inciting racial hatred.
John Hagan claims that the BNP has conducted right-wing extremist violence to gain &quot;institutionalized power&quot;. A 1997 report by Human Rights Watch accused the party of recruiting from skinhead groups and promoting racist violence.

In the past, Nick Griffin has defended the threat of violence to further the party&#x27;s aims. After the BNP won its first council seat in 1993, he wrote that the BNP should not be a &quot;postmodernist rightist party&quot; but &quot;a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan &#x27;Defend Rights for Whites&#x27; with well-directed boots and fists. When the crunch comes, power is the product of force and will, not of rational debate&quot;. In 1997 he said: &quot;It is more important to control the streets of a city than its council chambers.&quot;

A BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; programme reported on a number of BNP members who have had criminal convictions, some racially motivated. Some of the more notable convictions include:
* John Tyndall had convictions for assault and organising paramilitary neo-Nazi activities. In 1986 he was jailed for conspiracy to publish material likely to incite racial hatred.
* In 1998, Nick Griffin was convicted of violating section 19 of the Public Order Act 1986, relating to incitement to racial hatred. He received a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and was fined £2,300.
* Joseph Owens, a BNP candidate in Liverpool&#x27;s local elections, served eight months in prison for sending razor blades in the post to Jewish people and another term for carrying CS gas and knuckledusters.
* Colin Smith, who in 2004 was the BNP&#x27;s South East London organiser, has 17 convictions for burglary, theft, possession of drugs and assaulting a police officer.
* Richard Edmonds, at the time BNP National Organiser, was sentenced to three months in prison in 1994 for his part in a racist attack. Edmonds threw a glass at the victim as he was walking past an East London pub where a group of BNP supporters was drinking. Others then &#x27;glassed&#x27; the man in the face and punched and kicked him as he lay on the ground, including BNP supporter Stephen O&#x27;Shea, who was jailed for 12 months. Another BNP supporter, Simon Biggs, was jailed for four and a half years for his part in the attack.

Some members of the BNP were radicalised during their involvement with the party and subsequently sought to carry out acts of violence and terrorism. Tony Lecomber was imprisoned for three years for possessing explosives, after a nail bomb exploded while he was transporting it to the offices of the Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party in 1985. He was imprisoned for three years in 1991 whilst serving as the BNP&#x27;s Director of Propaganda for assaulting a Jewish teacher. In 1999, the ex-BNP member David Copeland used nail bombs to target homosexuals and ethnic minorities in London. In 2005, the BNP&#x27;s Burnley candidate Robert Cottage was convicted of stockpiling chemicals for use in what he believed was a coming civil war, while a Yorkshire BNP member, Terry Gavan, was convicted in 2010 for stockpiling firearms and nail bombs.

=== Reception ===

In 2011, Goodwin described the BNP as being &quot;the most successful party in the history of the extreme right in Britain&quot;. That same year, John E. Richardson noted that it had achieved &quot;a level of electoral success that is unparalleled in the history of British fascism&quot;. The historian Alan Sykes stated that &quot;in electoral terms&quot;, the BNP achieved &quot;more in the first three years of the twenty-first century&quot; than the British far right &quot;as a whole achieved in the previous seventy&quot;. However, Copsey said that the party&#x27;s belief that one day the conditions would be right for it to win a general election belonged to the &quot;Never-Never Land of British politics&quot;. Copsey also said that the BNP&#x27;s electoral successes had been modest in comparison to those achieved by extreme-right groups elsewhere in Western Europe such as France&#x27;s National Front, Italy&#x27;s National Alliance, and Belgium&#x27;s Vlaams Blok.

The BNP&#x27;s growth met a hostile reaction, and in 2011 the political scientists Copsey and Macklin described it as &quot;Britain&#x27;s most disliked party&quot;. It was widely reviled as racist and even following Griffin&#x27;s &quot;modernisation&quot; project it was still heavily tainted by its associations with neo-Nazism. For many years it remained closely associated with the National Front in the British public imagination.
The BNP remained unable to gain a broad appeal or widespread credibility. In a 2004 poll, seven out of ten voters said that they would never consider voting for the BNP. A 2009 poll found that two-thirds would &quot;under no circumstances&quot; consider voting BNP, while only 4% of respondents would &quot;definitely consider&quot; voting for them.

The Conservative leader Michael Howard stated that the BNP were a &quot;stain&quot; on British democracy, adding that &quot;this is not a political movement, this is a bunch of thugs dressed up as a political party&quot;. His successor David Cameron described it as a &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; organisation which &quot;thrives on hatred&quot;. The Labour prime minister, Tony Blair, called it a &quot;nasty, extreme organisation&quot;, while the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg termed it a &quot;party of thugs and fascists&quot;. In 2004, the General Synod of the Church of England declared that supporting the BNP was incompatible with Christianity, comparing it to &quot;spitting in the face of God&quot;. Christian groups throughout Britain have maintained that the BNP&#x27;s hostility toward cultural and ethnic diversity in the country was at odds with mainstream Christianity&#x27;s emphasis on inclusiveness, tolerance, and interfaith dialogue. Winston Churchill&#x27;s family has criticised the BNP&#x27;s use of his image and quotations, labelling it &quot;offensive and disgusting&quot;. The singer Vera Lynn condemned the party for selling a CD featuring her recordings on its website. In 2009, the Royal British Legion asked Griffin—at first privately and then publicly—to not wear their poppy symbol.

The British police, Fire Brigades Union, and Church of England, prohibited its members from joining the BNP. In 2002, Martin Narey, banned BNP membership among prison workers; he subsequently received death threats. In 2010, the Education Secretary Michael Gove announced bans allowing headteachers to ban their staff from being party members.
Individuals whose membership of the party was made public sometimes faced ostracism and the loss of their job: examples include a school headmaster who had to resign, a caretaker who was sacked after attending a BNP rally, and a police officer dismissed from his position. After BNP membership lists were leaked on the Internet, a number of police forces investigated officers whose names appeared on the lists.

In 2005, an invitation to Nick Griffin by the University of St Andrews Union Debating Society to participate in a debate on multiculturalism was withdrawn after protests. The BNP says that National Union of Journalists guidelines on reporting &quot;far right&quot; organisations forbid unionised journalists from reporting uncritically on the party. In April 2007, an election broadcast was cancelled by BBC Radio Wales whose lawyers believed that the broadcast was defamatory of the Chief Constable of North Wales Police, Richard Brunstrom. The BNP said that BBC editors were following an agenda.

==== Mainstream media and academia ====
Attitudes toward the BNP in both mainstream broadcast media and print journalism have been overwhelmingly negative, and no mainstream newspaper has endorsed the party. This hostile coverage has even been found in right-wing tabloids like the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; which otherwise share the BNP&#x27;s hostile attitude toward issues like immigration. In 2003, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; described the BNP as &quot;poisonous bigots&quot;, while in 2004 &quot;The Sun&quot; printed the headline of &quot;BNP: Bloody Nasty People&quot;. Senior BNP figures nevertheless believed that these tabloids&#x27; hostile coverage of immigration and Islam helped to legitimise and normalise the party and its views among much of the British public, a view echoed by some academic observers. When, in 2004, anti-racist activists picketed outside the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; office in central London to protest against its negative coverage of asylum seekers, BNP members organised a counter-picket at which they displayed the placard &quot;Vote BNP, Read the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;&quot;.

The BNP initially faced a &#x27;no platform for fascists&#x27; policy from the broadcast media, although this eroded as Griffin was invited on to a number of television programmes amid the party&#x27;s growing electoral success. When the BBC invited him to appear on &quot;Question Time&quot; in 2009 it was criticised by several trade unions, sections of the media, and several Labour politicians, all of whom believed that the BNP should not be given a public platform. Anti-fascist protesters assembled outside of the television studio to protest Griffin&#x27;s inclusion.

The first academic attention to be directed at the BNP appeared after it gained a councillor in the 1993 local elections. Nevertheless, throughout the 1990s it remained the subject of little academic research. Academic interest increased following its victories at local elections from 2002 onward. The first detailed monograph study to be devoted to the party was Nigel Copsey&#x27;s &quot;Contemporary British Fascism&quot;, first published in 2004. In September 2008, an academic symposium on the BNP was held at Teesside University.

==== The wider extreme-right and anti-fascists ====
Opposition to the BNP also came from the organised anti-fascist movement. By the mid-1990s, the BNP&#x27;s attempts to stage public events in Scotland, the North West and the Midlands were largely thwarted by the militant disruption of the Anti-Fascist Action (AFA) group. The BNP&#x27;s modernisation and move away from street demonstrations and toward electoral campaigning caused problems for the AFA, who proved unable to successfully change their tactics; on those occasions when AFA activists tried to forcibly disrupt BNP activities, they were prevented and arrested by riot police.

More liberal sections of the anti-fascist movement sought to counter the BNP through community-based initiatives. &quot;Searchlight&quot; encouraged trade unions to establish localised campaigns that would ensure that ethnic minority and other anti-BNP locals voted. It suggested that such campaigns should avoid associating with the mainstream parties from which BNP voters felt disenfranchised and that they should not be afraid of calling out Islamic fundamentalists and extremists active in the area. The Unite Against Fascism group also sought to maximise anti-BNP turnout at elections, calling on the electorate to vote for &quot;anyone but fascists&quot;. Evidence suggests that such anti-fascist activities did little to erode the far-right vote; this was in part because anti-fascist groups had encouraged the stereotype that BNP candidates were violent skinheads, something which conflicted with the more normal, friendly image that BNP activists cultivated when canvassing.

The BNP often received a hostile response from other sections of the British extreme-right. Some extreme-right-wingers, such as the British Freedom Party, expressed frustration at the party&#x27;s inability to moderate itself further on the issue of race, while those such as Colin Jordan and the NF accused the BNP—particularly under Griffin&#x27;s leadership—of being too moderate. This latter view was articulated by an extreme-right groupuscule, the International Third Position, when it said that the BNP &quot;has been openly courting the Jewish vote and pumping out material which confirms what most us knew years ago: the BNP has become a multi-racist, Zionist, queer-tolerant anti-Muslim pressure group&quot;.

In &quot;ASLEF v. United Kingdom&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights overturned an employment appeal tribunal ruling that awarded BNP member and train driver Jay Lee damages for expulsion from a trade union. In Redfearn v United Kingdom, the court ruled that members of racist organisations could lawfully be dismissed on health and safety grounds if there was a danger of violence occurring in the workplace. In November 2012, the European Court of Human Rights made a majority ruling (4 to 3) that in Redfearn&#x27;s case against the UK government, his rights under Article 11 (free association) had been infringed, but not those under Article 10 (free expression) or Article 14 (discrimination).

<doc id="4295" wikidata="Q176825" url="?curid=4295" title="Batavi (Germanic tribe)">
<text>The Batavi were an ancient Germanic tribe that lived around the modern Dutch Rhine delta in the area that the Romans called Batavia, from the second half of the first century BC to the third century AD. The name is also applied to several military units employed by the Romans that were originally raised among the Batavi. The tribal name, probably a derivation from &quot;batawjō&quot; (&quot;good island&quot;, from Germanic &quot;bat-&quot; meaning &quot;good, excellent&quot;, which is also in the English &quot;better&quot;, and &quot;awjō&quot; meaning &quot;island, land near water&quot;), may refer to the fertile Betuwe, a region today known as the &quot;fruitbasket of the Netherlands&quot;.

==Location==

The Batavi themselves are not mentioned by Julius Caesar in his commentary &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, although he is often thought to have founded his dynasty&#x27;s Germanic bodyguard, which was at least in later generations dominated by Batavi. But he did mention the &quot;Batavian island&quot; in the Rhine river. The island&#x27;s easternmost point is at a split in the Rhine, one arm being the Waal the other the Lower Rhine/Old Rhine (hence the Latin name &quot;Insula Batavorum&quot;, &quot;Island of the Batavi&quot;). Much later Tacitus wrote that they had originally been a tribe of the Chatti, a tribe in Germany also never mentioned by Caesar (unless they were his &quot;Suebi&quot;), who were forced by internal dissension to move to their new home. The time when this happened is unknown, but Caesar does describe forced movements of tribes from the east in his time, such as the Usipetes and Tencteri.

Tacitus also reports that before their arrival the area had been &quot;an uninhabited district on the extremity of the coast of Gaul, and also of a neighbouring island, surrounded by the ocean in front, and by the river Rhine in the rear and on either side&quot;. This view, however, is contradicted by the archeological evidence, which shows continuous habitation from at least the third century BC onward. 
The strategic position, to wit the high bank of the Waal offering an unimpeded view far into Germania Transrhenana (Germania Beyond the Rhine), was recognized first by Drusus, who built a massive fortress (&quot;castra&quot;) and a headquarters (&quot;praetorium&quot;) in imperial style. The latter was in use until the Batavian revolt.

Archeological evidence suggests they lived in small villages, composed of six to 12 houses in the very fertile lands between the rivers, and lived by agriculture and cattle-raising. Finds of horse skeletons in graves suggest a strong equestrian preoccupation. On the south bank of the Waal (in what is now Nijmegen) a Roman administrative center was built, called &quot;Oppidum Batavorum&quot;. An Oppidum was a fortified warehouse, where a tribe&#x27;s treasures were stored and guarded. This centre was razed during the Batavian Revolt. The Smetius Collection was instrumental in settling the debate about the exact location of the Batavians.

==Military units==
The first Batavi commander we know of is named Chariovalda, who led a charge across the Vīsurgis (Weser) river against the Cherusci led by Arminius during the campaigns of Germanicus in &quot;Germania Transrhenana&quot;.

Tacitus (&quot;De origine et situ Germanorum&quot; XXIX) described the Batavi as the bravest of the tribes of the area, hardened in the Germanic wars, with cohorts under their own commanders transferred to Britannia. They retained the honour of the ancient association with the Romans, not required to pay tribute or taxes and used by the Romans only for war: &quot;They furnished to the Empire nothing but men and arms&quot;, Tacitus remarked. Well regarded for their skills in horsemanship and swimming—for men and horses could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus. Dio Cassius describes this surprise tactic employed by Aulus Plautius against the &quot;barbarians&quot;—the British Celts— at the battle of the River Medway, 43:

The barbarians thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of Germanic tribesmen, who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. [...] Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found; but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. However, the Germans swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them. (Cassius Dio, Roman History, Book 60:20)
It is uncertain how they were able to accomplish this feat. The late fourth century writer on Roman military affairs Vegetius mentions soldiers using reed rafts, drawn by leather leads, to transport equipment across rivers. But the sources suggest the Batavi were able to swim across rivers actually wearing full armour and weapons. This would only have been possible by the use of some kind of buoyancy device: Ammianus Marcellinus mentions that the &quot;Cornuti&quot; regiment swam across a river floating on their shields &quot;as on a canoe&quot; (357). Since the shields were wooden, they may have provided sufficient buoyancy

The Batavi were used to form the bulk of the Emperor&#x27;s personal Germanic bodyguard from Augustus to Galba. They also provided a contingent for their indirect successors, the Emperor&#x27;s horse guards, the &quot;Equites singulares Augusti&quot;.

A Batavian contingent was used in an amphibious assault on Ynys Mon (Anglesey), taking the assembled Druids by surprise, as they were only expecting Roman ships.

Numerous altars and tombstones of the cohorts of Batavi, dating to the second century and third century, have been found along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, notably at Castlecary and Carrawburgh. As well as in Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania and Austria.

===Revolt of the Batavi===

Despite the alliance, one of the high-ranking Batavi, Julius Paullus, to give him his Roman name, was executed by Fonteius Capito on a false charge of rebellion. His kinsman Gaius Julius Civilis was paraded in chains in Rome before Nero; though he was acquitted by Galba, he was retained at Rome, and when he returned to his kin in the year of upheaval in the Roman Empire, 69, he headed a Batavian rebellion. He managed to capture Castra Vetera, the Romans&#x27; lost two legions, while two others (I Germanica and XVI Gallica) were controlled by the rebels. The rebellion became a real threat to the Empire when the conflict escalated to northern Gaul and Germania. The Roman army retaliated and invaded the &quot;insula Batavorum&quot;. A bridge was built over the river Nabalia, where the warring parties approached each other on both sides to negotiate peace. The narrative was told in great detail in Tacitus&#x27; History, book iv, although, unfortunately, the narrative breaks off abruptly at the climax. Following the uprising, Legio X &quot;Gemina&quot; was housed in a stone &quot;castra&quot; to keep an eye on the Batavians.

== Fate of the Batavi==
The Batavi were still mentioned in 355 during the reign of Constantius II (317–361), when their island was already dominated by the Salii, a Frankish tribe that had sought Roman protection there in 297 after having been expelled from their own country by the Saxons.

Constantius Gallus added inhabitants of Batavia to his legions, &quot;of whose discipline we still make use.&quot; It has been assumed they merged with the Salii shortly before or after and, after having been expelled by another tribe (it has been proposed this was the Chamavi), shared their subsequent migration to Toxandria. In the Late Roman army there was a unit called &quot;Batavi&quot;.

The name of the Bavarian town of Passau descends from the Roman &quot;Batavis&quot;, which was named after the Batavi. The town&#x27;s name is old as it shows the typical effects of the High German consonant shift (b &gt; p, t &gt; ss).

==The Batavian revival==

In the 16th-century emergence of a popular foundation story and origin myth for the Dutch people, the Batavians came to be regarded as their ancestors during their national struggle for independence during the Eighty Years&#x27; War. The mix of fancy and fact in the &quot;Cronyke van Hollandt, Zeelandt ende Vriesland&quot; (called the &quot;Divisiekroniek&quot;) by the Augustinian friar and humanist Cornelius Gerardi Aurelius, first published in 1517, brought the spare remarks in Tacitus&#x27; newly rediscovered &quot;Germania&quot; to a popular public; it was being reprinted as late as 1802. Contemporary Dutch virtues of independence, fortitude and industry were fully recognizable among the Batavians in more scholarly history represented in Hugo Grotius&#x27; &quot;Liber de Antiquitate Republicae Batavicorum&quot; (1610). The origin was perpetuated by Romeyn de Hooghe&#x27;s &quot;Spiegel van Staat der Vereenigden Nederlanden&quot; (&quot;Mirror of the State of the United Netherlands,&quot; 1706), which also ran to many editions, and it was revived in the atmosphere of Romantic nationalism in the late eighteenth-century reforms that saw a short-lived Batavian Republic and, in the colony of the Dutch East Indies, a capital that was named Batavia. Though since Indonesian independence the city is called Jakarta, its inhabitants up to the present still call themselves &quot;Betawi&quot; or &quot;Orang Betawi&quot;, i.e. &quot;People of Batavia&quot; – a name ultimately derived from the ancient Batavians.

The success of this tale of origins was mostly due to resemblance in anthropology, which was based on tribal knowledge. Being politically and geographically inclusive, this historical vision filled the needs of Dutch nation-building and integration in the 1890–1914 era.

However, a disadvantage of this historical nationalism soon became apparent. It suggested there were no strong external borders, while allowing for the fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society polarized into three parts. After 1945, the tribal knowledge lost its grip on anthropology and mostly vanished. Modern variants of the Batavian founding myth are made more accurate by pointing out that the Batavians were one part of the ancestry of the Dutch people - together with the Frisians, Franks and Saxons – by tracing patterns of DNA. Echoes of this cultural continuity can still be found among various areas of Dutch modern culture, such as the very popular replica of the ship &quot;Batavia&quot; that can today be found in Lelystad.

<doc id="4298" wikidata="Q35856" url="?curid=4298" title="Baptism">
<text>Baptism (from ) is a Christian sacrament of initiation almost invariably with the use of water. It may be performed by sprinkling or pouring water on the head, or by immersing in water either partially or completely, traditionally three times, once for each person of the Trinity. The synoptic gospels recount that John the Baptist baptised Jesus. Baptism is considered a sacrament in most churches, and as an ordinance in others. Baptism according to the Trinitarian formula, which is done in most mainstream Christian denominations, is seen as being a basis for Christian ecumenism, the concept of unity amongst Christians. Baptism is also called christening, although some reserve the word &quot;christening&quot; for the baptism of infants. In certain Christian denominations, such as the Catholic Churches, Eastern Orthodox Churches, Oriental Orthodox Churches, Assyrian Church of the East, and Lutheran Churches, baptism is the door to church membership, with candidates taking baptismal vows. It has also given its name to the Baptist churches and denominations.

Certain schools of Christian thought (such as Catholic and Lutheran theology) regard baptism as necessary for salvation, but some writers, such as Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531), have denied its necessity. Though water baptism is extremely common among Christian denominations, some, such as Quakers and The Salvation Army, do not practice water baptism at all. Among denominations that practice baptism, differences occur in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite. Most Christians baptize using the trinitarian formula &quot;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&quot; (following the Great Commission), but Oneness Pentecostals baptize using Jesus&#x27; name only. The majority of Christians baptize infants; many others, such as Baptist Churches, regard only believer&#x27;s baptism as true baptism. In certain denominations, such as the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, the individual being baptized receives a cross necklace that is worn for the rest of their life, inspired by the Sixth Ecumenical Council (Synod) of Constantinople.

Outside of Christianity, Mandaeans undergo repeated baptism for purification instead of initiation. They consider John the Baptist to be their greatest prophet and name all rivers &quot;yardena&quot; after the River Jordan.

The term &quot;baptism&quot; has also been used metaphorically to refer to any ceremony, trial, or experience by which a person is initiated, purified, or given a name. Martyrdom was identified early in Christian church history as &quot;baptism by blood&quot;, enabling the salvation of martyrs who had not been baptized by water. Later, the Catholic Church identified a baptism of desire, by which those preparing for baptism who die before actually receiving the sacrament are considered saved. In the Methodist tradition, Baptism with the Holy Spirit, has referred to the second work of grace, entire sanctification; in Pentecostalism, the term Baptism with the Holy Spirit is identified with speaking in tongues.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;baptism&quot; is derived indirectly through Latin from the neuter Greek concept noun (Greek , ), which is a neologism in the New Testament derived from the masculine Greek noun (), a term for ritual washing in Greek language texts of Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period, such as the Septuagint. Both of these nouns are derived from the verb (, transitive verb), which is used in Jewish texts for ritual washing, and in the New Testament both for ritual washing and also for the apparently new rite of .

The Greek verb (), , from which the verb is derived, is in turn hypothetically traced to a reconstructed Indo-European root *&quot;gʷabh-&quot;, .

The Greek words are used in a great variety of meanings. and in Hellenism had the general usage of &quot;immersion&quot;, &quot;going under&quot; (as a material in a liquid dye) or &quot;perishing&quot; (as in a ship sinking or a person drowning), with the same double meanings as in English &quot;to sink into&quot; or &quot;to be overwhelmed by&quot;, with bathing or washing only occasionally used and usually in sacral contexts.
==History==

The practice of baptism emerged from Jewish ritualistic practices during the Second Temple Period, out of which figures such as John the Baptist emerged. For example, various texts in the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) corpus at Qumran describe ritual practices involving washing, bathing, sprinkling, and immersing. One example of such a text is a DSS known as the Rule of the Community, which says &quot;And by the compliance of his soul with all the laws of God his flesh is cleansed by being sprinkled with cleansing waters and being made holy with the waters of repentance.&quot;

The Mandaeans, who are followers of John the Baptist, practice frequent full immersion baptism (&quot;masbuta&quot;) as a ritual of purification. According to Mandaean sources, they left the Jordan Valley in the 1st century AD.

John the Baptist, who is considered a forerunner to Christianity, used baptism as the central sacrament of his messianic movement. The apostle Paul distinguished between the baptism of John, (&quot;baptism of repentance&quot;) and baptism in the name of Jesus, and it is questionable whether Christian baptism was in some way linked with that of John. However, according to Mark 1:8, John seems to connect his water baptism as a type of the true, ultimate baptism of Jesus, which is by the Spirit. Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism.

Though some form of immersion was likely the most common method of baptism in the early church, many of the writings from the ancient church appeared to view this mode of baptism as inconsequential. The Didache 7.1–3 (AD 60–150) allowed for affusion practices in situations where immersion was not practical. Likewise, Tertullian (AD 196–212) allowed for varying approaches to baptism even if those practices did not conform to biblical or traditional mandates (cf. De corona militis 3; De baptismo 17). Finally, Cyprian (ca. AD 256) explicitly stated that the amount of water was inconsequential and defended immersion, affusion, and aspersion practices (Epistle 75.12). As a result, there was no uniform or consistent mode of baptism in the ancient church prior to the fourth century.

By the third and fourth centuries, baptism involved catechetical instruction as well as chrismation, exorcisms, laying on of hands, and recitation of a creed.

In the Early Middle Ages infant baptism became common and the rite was significantly simplified and increasingly emphasized. In Western Europe Affusion became the normal mode of baptism between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, though immersion was still practiced into the sixteenth. In the medieval period, some radical Christians rejected the practice of baptism as a sacrament. Sects such as the Tondrakians, Cathars, Arnoldists, Petrobrusians, Henricans, Brethren of the Free Spirit and the Lollards were regarded as heretics by the Catholic Church. In the sixteenth century, Martin Luther retained baptism as a sacrament, but Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli considered baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper to be symbolic. Anabaptists denied the validity of the practice of infant baptism, and rebaptized converts.

==Mode and manner==

Baptism is practiced in several different ways. Aspersion is the sprinkling of water on the head, and affusion is the pouring of water over the head. Traditionally, a person is sprinkled, poured, or immersed three times for each person of the Holy Trinity, with this ancient Christian practice called &quot;trine baptism&quot; or &quot;triune baptism&quot;. &quot;The Didache&quot; specifies:
The word &quot;immersion&quot; is derived from late Latin &quot;immersio&quot;, a noun derived from the verb &quot;immergere&quot; (&quot;in&quot; – &quot;into&quot; + &quot;mergere&quot; &quot;dip&quot;). In relation to baptism, some use it to refer to any form of dipping, whether the body is put completely under water or is only partly dipped in water; they thus speak of immersion as being either total or partial. Others, of the Anabaptist belief, use &quot;immersion&quot; to mean exclusively plunging someone entirely under the surface of the water. The term &quot;immersion&quot; is also used of a form of baptism in which water is poured over someone standing in water, without submersion of the person. On these three meanings of the word &quot;immersion&quot;, see Immersion baptism.

When &quot;immersion&quot; is used in opposition to &quot;submersion&quot;, it indicates the form of baptism in which the candidate stands or kneels in water and water is poured over the upper part of the body. Immersion in this sense has been employed in West and East since at least the 2nd century and is the form in which baptism is generally depicted in early Christian art. In the West, this method of baptism began to be replaced by affusion baptism from around the 8th century, but it continues in use in Eastern Christianity.

The word submersion comes from the late Latin (&quot;sub-&quot; &quot;under, below&quot; + &quot;mergere&quot; &quot;plunge, dip&quot;) and is also sometimes called &quot;complete immersion&quot;. It is the form of baptism in which the water completely covers the candidate&#x27;s body. Submersion is practiced in the Orthodox and several other Eastern Churches. In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, baptism by submersion is used in the Ambrosian Rite and is one of the methods provided in the Roman Rite of the baptism of infants. It is seen as obligatory among some groups that have arisen since the Protestant Reformation, such as Baptists.

===Meaning of the Greek verb &quot;baptizein&quot;===

The Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott gives the primary meaning of the verb &quot;baptízein&quot;, from which the English verb &quot;baptize&quot; is derived, as &quot;dip, plunge&quot;, and gives examples of plunging a sword into a throat or an embryo and for drawing wine by dipping a cup in the bowl; for New Testament usage it gives two meanings: &quot;baptize&quot;, with which it associates the Septuagint mention of Naaman dipping himself in the Jordan River, and &quot;perform ablutions&quot;, as in Luke 11:38.

Although the Greek verb &quot;baptízein&quot; does not exclusively mean dip, plunge or immerse (it is used with literal and figurative meanings such as &quot;sink&quot;, &quot;disable&quot;, &quot;overwhelm&quot;, &quot;go under&quot;, &quot;overborne&quot;, &quot;draw from a bowl&quot;), lexical sources typically cite this as a meaning of the word in both the Septuagint and the New Testament.

&quot;While it is true that the basic root meaning of the Greek words for baptize and baptism is immerse/immersion, it is not true that the words can simply be reduced to this meaning, as can be seen from Mark 10:38–39, Luke 12:50, Matthew 3:11, Luke 3:16, and Corinthians10:2.&quot;

Two passages in the Gospels indicate that the verb &quot;baptízein&quot; did not always indicate submersion. The first is Luke 11:38, which tells how a Pharisee, at whose house Jesus ate, &quot;was astonished to see that he did not first wash (&quot;ἐβαπτίσθη&quot;, aorist passive of &quot;βαπτίζω&quot;—literally, &quot;was baptized&quot;) before dinner&quot;. This is the passage that Liddell and Scott cites as an instance of the use of &#x27; to mean &quot;perform ablutions&quot;. Jesus&#x27; omission of this action is similar to that of his disciples: &quot;Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash (&#x27;) not their hands when they eat bread&quot;. The other Gospel passage pointed to is: &quot;The Pharisees...do not eat unless they wash (&quot;&quot;, the ordinary word for washing) their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they wash themselves (literally, &quot;baptize themselves&quot;—&quot;βαπτίσωνται&quot;, passive or middle voice of &quot;βαπτίζω&quot;)&quot;.

Scholars of various denominations claim that these two passages show that invited guests, or people returning from market, would not be expected to immerse themselves (&quot;baptize themselves&quot;) totally in water but only to practise the partial immersion of dipping their hands in water or to pour water over them, as is the only form admitted by present Jewish custom. In the second of the two passages, it is actually the hands that are specifically identified as &quot;washed&quot;, not the entire person, for whom the verb used is &quot;baptízomai&quot;, literally &quot;be baptized&quot;, &quot;be immersed&quot;, a fact obscured by English versions that use &quot;wash&quot; as a translation of both verbs. Zodhiates concludes that the washing of the hands was done by immersing them. The Liddell–Scott–Jones Greek-English Lexicon (1996) cites the other passage (Luke 11:38) as an instance of the use of the verb &quot;baptízein&quot; to mean &quot;perform ablutions&quot;, not &quot;submerge&quot;. References to the cleaning of vessels which use βαπτίζω also refer to immersion.

As already mentioned, the lexicographical work of Zodhiates says that, in the second of these two cases, the verb &quot;baptízein&quot; indicates that, after coming from the market, the Pharisees washed their hands by immersing them in collected water. Balz &amp; Schneider understand the meaning of βαπτίζω, used in place of ῥαντίσωνται (sprinkle), to be the same as βάπτω, to dip or immerse, a verb used of the partial dipping of a morsel held in the hand into wine or of a finger into spilled blood.

A possible additional use of the verb &quot;baptízein&quot; to relate to ritual washing is suggested by Peter Leithart (2007) who suggests that Paul&#x27;s phrase &quot;Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead?&quot; relates to Jewish ritual washing. In Jewish Greek the verb &quot;baptízein&quot; &quot;baptized&quot; has a wider reference than just &quot;baptism&quot; and in Jewish context primarily applies to the masculine noun &quot;baptismós&quot; &quot;ritual washing&quot;

The verb &quot;baptízein&quot; occurs four times in the Septuagint in the context of ritual washing, &quot;baptismós&quot;; Judith cleansing herself from menstrual impurity, Naaman washing seven times to be cleansed from leprosy, etc.

Additionally, in the New Testament only, the verb &quot;baptízein&quot; can also relate to the neuter noun &quot;báptisma&quot; &quot;baptism&quot; which is a neologism unknown in the Septuagint and other pre-Christian Jewish texts.

This broadness in the meaning of &quot;baptízein&quot; is reflected in English Bibles rendering &quot;wash&quot;, where Jewish ritual washing is meant: for example Mark 7:4 states that the Pharisees &quot;except they wash (Greek &quot;baptize&quot;), they do not eat&quot;, and &quot;baptize&quot; where &quot;báptisma&quot;, the new Christian rite, is intended.

===Derived nouns===

Two nouns derived from the verb &quot;baptízō&quot; (βαπτίζω) appear in the New Testament: the masculine noun &quot;baptismós&quot; (βαπτισμός) and the neuter noun &quot;báptisma&quot; (βάπτισμα):
* &quot;baptismós&quot; (βαπτισμός) refers in Mark 7:4 to a water-rite for the purpose of purification, washing, cleansing, of dishes; in the same verse and in Hebrews 9:10 to Levitical cleansings of vessels or of the body; and in Hebrews 6:2 perhaps also to baptism, though there it may possibly refer to washing an inanimate object. According to Spiros Zodhiates when referring merely to the cleansing of utensils &quot;baptismós&quot; (βαπτισμός) is equated with &quot;rhantismós&quot; (ῥαντισμός, &quot;sprinkling&quot;), found only in Hebrews 12:24 and Peter 1:2, a noun used to indicate the symbolic cleansing by the Old Testament priest.
* &quot;báptisma&quot; (βάπτισμα), which is a neologism appearing to originate in the New Testament, and probably should not be confused with the earlier Jewish concept of &quot;baptismós&quot; (βαπτισμός), Later this is found only in writings by Christians. In the New Testament, it appears at least 21 times:
** 13 times with regard to the rite practised by John the Baptist;
** 3 times with reference to the specific Christian rite (4 times if account is taken of its use in some manuscripts of Colossians 2:12, where, however, it is most likely to have been changed from the original &quot;baptismós&quot; than vice versa);
** 5 times in a metaphorical sense.
* Manuscript variation: In Colossians, some manuscripts have neuter noun &quot;báptisma&quot; (βάπτισμα), but some have masculine noun &quot;baptismós&quot; (βαπτισμός), and this is the reading given in modern critical editions of the New Testament. If this reading is correct, then this is the only New Testament instance in which &quot;baptismós&quot; (βαπτισμός) is clearly used of Christian baptism, rather than of a generic washing, unless the opinion of some is correct that Hebrews 6:2 may also refer to Christian baptism.
* The feminine noun &quot;baptisis&quot;, along with the masculine noun &quot;baptismós&quot; both occur in Josephus&#x27; Antiquities (J. AJ 18.5.2) relating to the murder of John the Baptist by Herod. This feminine form is not used elsewhere by Josephus, nor in the New Testament.

===Apparel===

Until the Middle Ages, most baptisms were performed with the candidates naked—as is evidenced by most of the early portrayals of baptism (some of which are shown in this article), and the early Church Fathers and other Christian writers. Deaconesses helped female candidates for reasons of modesty.

Typical of these is Cyril of Jerusalem who wrote &quot;On the Mysteries of Baptism&quot; in the 4th century (c. 350 AD):

The symbolism is threefold:

1. Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth—&quot;by water and the Spirit&quot;—the nakedness of baptism (the second birth) paralleled the condition of one&#x27;s original birth. For example, John Chrysostom calls the baptism &quot;λοχείαν&quot;, i.e., giving birth, and &quot;new way of creation...from water and Spirit&quot; (&quot;to John&quot; speech 25,2), and later elaborates:

2. The removal of clothing represented the &quot;image of putting off the old man with his deeds&quot; (as per Cyril, above), so the stripping of the body before for baptism represented taking off the trappings of sinful self, so that the &quot;new man&quot;, which is given by Jesus, can be put on.

3. As Cyril again asserts above, as Adam and Eve in scripture were naked, innocent and unashamed in the Garden of Eden, nakedness during baptism was seen as a renewal of that innocence and state of original sinlessness. Other parallels can also be drawn, such as between the exposed condition of Christ during His crucifixion, and the crucifixion of the &quot;old man&quot; of the repentant sinner in preparation for baptism.

Changing customs and concerns regarding modesty probably contributed to the practice of permitting or requiring the baptismal candidate to either retain their undergarments (as in many Renaissance paintings of baptism such as those by da Vinci, Tintoretto, Van Scorel, Masaccio, de Wit and others) or to wear, as is almost universally the practice today, baptismal robes. These robes are most often white, symbolizing purity. Some groups today allow any suitable clothes to be worn, such as trousers and a T-shirt—practical considerations include how easily the clothes will dry (denim is discouraged), and whether they will become see-through when wet.

In certain Christian denominations, the individual being baptized receives a cross necklace that is worn for the rest of their life as a &quot;sign of the triumph of Christ over death and our belonging to Christ&quot; (though it is replaced with a new cross pendant if lost or broken). This practice of baptized Christians wearing a cross necklace at all times is derived from Canon 73 and Canon 82 of the Sixth Ecumenical Council (Synod) of Constantinople, which declared:

==Meaning and effects==

There are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Catholics, Orthodox, and most mainline Protestant groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a sacrament, and speak of &quot;baptismal regeneration&quot;. Its importance is related to their interpretation of the meaning of the &quot;Mystical Body of Christ&quot; as found in the New Testament. This view is shared by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox denominations, and by churches formed early during the Protestant Reformation such as Lutheran and Anglican. For example, Martin Luther said:

The Churches of Christ,&quot; Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Christadelphians, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints espouse baptism as necessary for salvation.

For Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of the children of God (&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, 1212–13). It configures the person to Christ (CCC 1272), and obliges the Christian to share in the church&#x27;s apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood (martyrdom). In his encyclical &quot;Mystici corporis Christi&quot; of June 29, 1943, Pope Pius XII spoke of baptism and profession of the true faith as what makes members of the one true church, which is the body of Jesus Christ himself, as God the Holy Spirit has taught through the Apostle Paul:
By contrast, Anabaptist and Evangelical Protestants recognize baptism as an outward sign of an inward reality following on an individual believer&#x27;s experience of forgiving grace. Reformed and Methodist Protestants maintain a link between baptism and regeneration, but insist that it is not automatic or mechanical, and that regeneration may occur at a different time than baptism. Churches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God &quot;by the merits of Christ&#x27;s blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God&#x27;s kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.&quot; Thus, they see baptism as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it &quot;is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God&quot;.

===Christian traditions===
The liturgy of baptism for Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists makes clear reference to baptism as not only a symbolic burial and resurrection, but an actual supernatural transformation, one that draws parallels to the experience of Noah and the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea divided by Moses. Thus, baptism is literally and symbolically not only cleansing, but also dying and rising again with Christ. Catholics believe baptism is necessary to cleanse the taint of original sin, and so commonly baptise infants.

The Eastern Churches (Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy) also baptize infants on the basis of texts, such as Matthew 19:14, which are interpreted as supporting full church membership for children. In these denominations, baptism is immediately followed by Chrismation and Communion at the next Divine Liturgy, regardless of age. Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin of Adam. Anglicans believe that baptism is also the entry into the church. Most Methodists and Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.

Eastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on complete threefold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. Latin Church Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Eastern Catholics usually by submersion, or at least partial immersion. However, submersion is gaining in popularity within the Latin Church. In newer church sanctuaries, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion. Anglicans baptize by immersion or affusion.

According to evidence which can be traced back to about the year 200, sponsors or godparents are present at baptism and vow to uphold the Christian education and life of the baptized.

Baptists argue that the Greek word originally meant &quot;to immerse&quot;. They interpret some Biblical passages concerning baptism as requiring submersion of the body in water. They also state that only submersion reflects the symbolic significance of being &quot;buried&quot; and &quot;raised&quot; with Christ. Baptist Churches baptize in the name of the Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, they do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation; but rather that it is an act of Christian obedience.

Some &quot;Full Gospel&quot; charismatic churches such as Oneness Pentecostals baptize only in the name of Jesus Christ, citing Peter&#x27;s preaching baptism in the name of Jesus as their authority.

===Ecumenical statements===
In 1982 the World Council of Churches published the ecumenical paper &quot;Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry&quot;. The preface of the document states:

A 1997 document, &quot;Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism&quot;, gave the views of a commission of experts brought together under the aegis of the World Council of Churches. It states:

Those who heard, who were baptized and entered the community&#x27;s life, were already made witnesses of and partakers in the promises of God for the last days: the forgiveness of sins through baptism in the name of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on all flesh. Similarly, in what may well be a baptismal pattern, 1 Peter testifies that proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and teaching about new life lead to purification and new birth. This, in turn, is followed by eating and drinking God&#x27;s food, by participation in the life of the community—the royal priesthood, the new temple, the people of God—and by further moral formation. At the beginning of 1 Peter the writer sets this baptism in the context of obedience to Christ and sanctification by the Spirit. So baptism into Christ is seen as baptism into the Spirit. In the fourth gospel Jesus&#x27; discourse with Nicodemus indicates that birth by water and Spirit becomes the gracious means of entry into the place where God rules.

===Validity considerations by some churches===
The vast majority of Christian denominations admit the theological idea that baptism is a sacrament, that has actual spiritual, holy and salvific effects. Certain key criteria must be complied with for it to be valid, i.e., to actually have those effects. If these key criteria are met, violation of some rules regarding baptism, such as varying the authorized rite for the ceremony, renders the baptism illicit (contrary to the church&#x27;s laws) but still valid.

One of the criteria for validity is use of the correct form of words. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb &quot;to baptize&quot; is essential. Catholics of the Latin Church, Anglicans and Methodists use the form &quot;I baptize you in the name of...&quot;. The passive voice is used by Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholics, the form being &quot;The Servant of God is baptized in the name of...&quot;.

Use of the Trinitarian formula (&quot;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&quot;) is also considered essential; thus these churches do not accept as valid baptisms of non-Trinitarian churches such as Oneness Pentecostals.

Another essential condition is use of water. A baptism in which some liquid that would not usually be called water, such as wine, milk, soup or fruit juice was used would not be considered valid.

Another requirement is that the celebrant intends to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention &quot;to do what the Church does&quot;, not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.

Some conditions expressly do not affect validity—for example, whether submersion, immersion, affusion (pouring) or aspersion (sprinkling) is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized. As has been stated, &quot;it is not sufficient for the water to merely touch the candidate; it must also flow, otherwise there would seem to be no real ablution. At best, such a baptism would be considered doubtful. If the water touches only the hair, the sacrament has probably been validly conferred, though in practice the safer course must be followed. If only the clothes of the person have received the aspersion, the baptism is undoubtedly void.&quot; For many communions, validity is not affected if a single submersion or pouring is performed rather than a triple, but in Orthodoxy this is controversial.

According to the Catholic Church, baptism imparts an indelible &quot;seal&quot; upon the soul of the baptized and therefore a person who has already been baptized cannot be validly baptized again. This teaching was affirmed against the Donatists who practiced rebaptism. The grace received in baptism is believed to operate &quot;ex opere operato&quot; and is therefore considered valid even if administered in heretical or schismatic groups.

===Recognition by other denominations===
The Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Methodist Churches accept baptism performed by other denominations within this group as valid, subject to certain conditions, including the use of the Trinitarian formula. It is only possible to be baptized once, so people with valid baptisms from other denominations may not be baptized again upon conversion or transfer. For Roman Catholics, this is affirmed in the Canon Law 864, in which it is written that &quot;[e]very person not yet baptized and only such a person is capable of baptism.&quot; Such people are accepted upon making a profession of faith, and if they have not yet validly received the sacrament/rite of confirmation or chrismation, by being confirmed. Specifically, &quot;Methodist theologians argued that since God never abrogated a covenant made and sealed with proper intentionality, rebaptism was never an option, unless the original baptism had been defective by not having been made in the name of the Trinity.&quot; In some cases, it can be difficult to decide if the original baptism was in fact valid; if there is doubt, conditional baptism is administered, with a formula on the lines of &quot;If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you...&quot;

The Catholic Church ordinarily recognizes as valid the baptisms of Christians of the Eastern Orthodox, Churches of Christ, Congregationalist, Anglican, Lutheran, Old Catholic, Polish National Catholic, Reformed, Baptist, Brethren, Methodist, Presbyterian, Waldensian, and United Protestant denominations; Christians of these traditions are received into the Catholic Church through the sacrament of Confirmation. Some individuals of the Mennonite, Pentecostal and Adventist traditions who wish to be received into the Catholic Church may be required to receive a conditional baptism due to concerns about the validity of the sacraments in those traditions. The Catholic Church has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The Reformed Churches recognize as valid, baptisms administered in the Catholic Church, among other churches using the Trinitarian formula.

Practice in the Eastern Orthodox Church for converts from other communions is not uniform. However, generally, baptisms performed in the name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church; Christians of the Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Old Catholic, Moravian, Anglican, Methodist, Reformed, Presbyterian, Brethren, Assemblies of God, or Baptist traditions can be received into the Eastern Orthodox Church through the sacrament of Chrismation. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised in the name of the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he/she has been baptized in another Christian confession (other than Orthodox Christianity) his/her previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by chrismation or, in rare circumstances, confession of faith alone as long as the baptism was done in the name of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The exact procedure is dependent on local canons and is the subject of some controversy.

Oriental Orthodox Churches recognise the validity of baptisms performed within the Eastern Orthodox Communion. Some also recognise baptisms performed by Catholic Churches. Any supposed baptism not performed using the Trinitarian formula is considered invalid.

In the eyes of the Catholic Church, all Orthodox Churches, Anglican, and Lutheran Churches, the baptism conferred by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is invalid. An article published together with the official declaration to that effect gave reasons for that judgment, summed up in the following words: &quot;The Baptism of the Catholic Church and that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints differ essentially, both for what concerns faith in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in whose name Baptism is conferred, and for what concerns the relationship to Christ who instituted it.&quot;

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stresses that baptism must be administered by one having proper authority; consequently, the church does not recognize the baptism of any other church as effective.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not recognise any other baptism occurring after 1914 as valid, as they believe that they are now the one true church of Christ, and that the rest of &quot;Christendom&quot; is false religion.

===Officiant===

There is debate among Christian churches as to who can administer baptism. Some claim that the examples given in the New Testament only show apostles and deacons administering baptism. Ancient Christian churches interpret this as indicating that baptism should be performed by the clergy except &quot;in extremis&quot;, i.e., when the one being baptized is in immediate danger of death. Then anyone may baptize, provided, in the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the person who does the baptizing is a member of that church, or, in the view of the Catholic Church, that the person, even if not baptized, intends to do what the church does in administering the rite. Many Protestant churches see no specific prohibition in the biblical examples and permit any believer to baptize another.

In the Roman Catholic Church, canon law for the Latin Church lays down that the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest or deacon, but its administration is one of the functions &quot;especially entrusted to the parish priest&quot;. If the person to be baptized is at least fourteen years old, that person&#x27;s baptism is to be referred to the bishop, so that he can decide whether to confer the baptism himself. If no ordinary minister is available, a catechist or some other person whom the local ordinary has appointed for this purpose may licitly do the baptism; indeed in a case of necessity &quot;any&quot; person (irrespective of that person&#x27;s religion) who has the requisite intention may confer the baptism By &quot;a case of necessity&quot; is meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. &quot;The requisite intention&quot; is, at the minimum level, the intention &quot;to do what the Church does&quot; through the rite of baptism.

In the Eastern Catholic Churches, a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister. Administration of the sacrament is reserved to the parish priest or to another priest to whom he or the local hierarch grants permission, a permission that can be presumed if in accordance with canon law. However, &quot;in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize.&quot;

The discipline of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. They require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the church. The Latin Catholic Church does not insist on this condition, considering that the effect of the sacrament, such as membership of the church, is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the Holy Spirit. For the Orthodox, while Baptism &quot;in extremis&quot; may be administered by a deacon or any lay-person, if the newly baptized person survives, a priest must still perform the other prayers of the Rite of Baptism, and administer the Mystery of Chrismation.

The discipline of Anglicanism and Lutheranism is similar to that of the Latin Catholic Church. For Methodists and many other Protestant denominations, the ordinary minister of baptism is an ordained or appointed minister.

Newer movements of Protestant Evangelical churches, particularly non-denominational, allow laypeople to baptize.

In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, only a man who has been ordained to the Aaronic priesthood holding the priesthood office of priest or higher office in the Melchizedek priesthood may administer baptism.

A Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses baptism is performed by a &quot;dedicated male&quot; adherent. Only in extraordinary circumstances would a &quot;dedicated&quot; baptizer be unbaptized (see section &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;).

==Practitioners==
===Protestantism===
====Anabaptist====
Early Anabaptists were given that name because they re-baptized persons who they felt had not been properly baptized, as they did not recognize infant baptism.

The traditional form of Anabaptist baptism was pouring, the form commonly used in Western Christianity in the early 16th century when they emerged. Pouring continues to be normative in Mennonite, Amish and Hutterite traditions of Anabaptist Christianity. The Mennonite Brethren Church, Schwarzenau Brethren and River Brethren denominations of Anabaptist Christianity practice immersion. The Schwarzenau church immerses in the forward position three times, for each person of the Holy Trinity and because &quot;the Bible says Jesus bowed his head (letting it fall forward) and died. Baptism represents a dying of the old, sinful self.&quot; Today all modes of baptism (such as pouring and immersion) can be found among Anabaptists.

Conservative Mennonite Anabaptists count baptism to be one of the seven ordinances. In Anabaptist theology, baptism is a part of the process of salvation. For Anabaptists, &quot;believer&#x27;s baptism consists of three parts, the Spirit, the water, and the blood—these three witnesses on earth.&quot; According to Anabaptist theology: (1) In believer&#x27;s baptism, the Holy Spirit witnesses the candidate entering into a covenant with God. (2) God, in believer&#x27;s baptism, &quot;grants a baptized believer the water of baptism as a sign of His covenant with them—that such a one indicates and publicly confesses that he wants to live in true obedience towards God and fellow believers with a blameless life.&quot; (3) Integral to believer&#x27;s baptism is the candidate&#x27;s mission to witness to the world even unto martyrdom, echoing Jesus&#x27; words that &quot;they would be baptized with His baptism, witnessing to the world when their blood was spilt.&quot;

====Baptist====
For the majority of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Baptism does not accomplish anything in itself, but is an outward personal sign that the person&#x27;s sins have already been washed away by the blood of Christ&#x27;s cross.

For a new convert the general practice is that baptism also allows the person to be a registered member of the local Baptist congregation (though some churches have adopted &quot;new members classes&quot; as an additional mandatory step for congregational membership).

Regarding rebaptism the general rules are:
* baptisms by other than immersion are not recognized as valid and therefore rebaptism by immersion is required; and
* baptisms by immersion in other denominations may be considered valid if performed after the person having professed faith in Jesus Christ (though among the more conservative groups such as Independent Baptists, rebaptism may be required by the local congregation if performed in a non-Baptist church—and, in extreme cases, even if performed within a Baptist church that wasn&#x27;t an Independent Baptist congregation)

For newborns, there is a ceremony called child dedication.

Tennessee antebellum Methodist circuit rider and newspaper publisher William G. Brownlow stated within his 1856 book &quot;The Great Iron Wheel Examined; or, Its False Spokes Extracted, and an Exhibition of Elder Graves, Its Builder&quot; that the immersion baptism practiced within the Baptist churches as found within the United States did not extend in a &quot;regular line of succession...from John the Baptist—but from old Zeke Holliman and his true yoke-fellow, Mr. [Roger] Williams&quot; as during 1639 Holliman and Williams first immersion baptized each other and then immersion baptized the ten other members of the first Baptist church in British America at Providence, Rhode Island.

====Churches of Christ====
Baptism in Churches of Christ is performed only by full bodily immersion, based on the Koine Greek verb &quot;baptizo&quot; which means to dip, immerse, submerge or plunge. Submersion is seen as more closely conforming to the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus than other modes of baptism. Churches of Christ argue that historically immersion was the mode used in the 1st century, and that pouring and sprinkling later emerged as secondary modes when immersion was not possible. Over time these secondary modes came to replace immersion. Only those mentally capable of belief and repentance are baptized (i.e., infant baptism is not practiced because the New Testament has no precedent for it).

Churches of Christ have historically had the most conservative position on baptism among the various branches of the Restoration Movement, understanding baptism by immersion to be a necessary part of conversion. The most significant disagreements concerned the extent to which a correct understanding of the role of baptism is necessary for its validity. David Lipscomb insisted that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey God, the baptism was valid, even if the individual did not fully understand the role baptism plays in salvation. Austin McGary contended that to be valid, the convert must also understand that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. McGary&#x27;s view became the prevailing one in the early 20th century, but the approach advocated by Lipscomb never totally disappeared. As such, the general practice among churches of Christ is to require rebaptism by immersion of converts, even those who were previously baptized by immersion in other churches.

More recently, the rise of the International Churches of Christ has caused some to reexamine the issue.

Churches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God &quot;by the merits of Christ&#x27;s blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God&#x27;s kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.&quot; Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it &quot;is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God.&quot; While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a &quot;sacrament&quot;, their view of it can legitimately be described as &quot;sacramental&quot;. They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself, and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than just a symbol of conversion.

A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as just a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as &quot;the event that places the believer &#x27;into Christ&#x27; where God does the ongoing work of transformation.&quot; There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to &quot;reexamine the richness of the biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity.&quot;

Because of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation, some Baptists hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. However, members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual. Rather, their inclination is to point to the biblical passage in which Peter, analogizing baptism to Noah&#x27;s flood, posits that &quot;likewise baptism doth also now save us&quot; but parenthetically clarifies that baptism is &quot;&quot;not&quot; the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the &quot;response of a good conscience&quot; toward God&quot; (1 Peter 3:21). One author from the churches of Christ describes the relationship between faith and baptism this way, &quot;&quot;Faith&quot; is the &quot;reason why&quot; a person is a child of God; &quot;baptism&quot; is the &quot;time at which&quot; one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God&quot; (italics are in the source). Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance, rather than a &quot;work&quot; that earns salvation.

====Lutheranism====

In Lutheran Christianity, baptism is a sacrament that regenerates the soul. Upon one&#x27;s baptism, one receives the Holy Spirit and becomes a part of the church. According to Martin Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism, it is the word and command of God &quot;in and with the water&quot; that gives baptism its power, which &quot;works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare&quot;. In Lutheran theology, baptism is not viewed as a work that the baptizer performs in obedience to the law, but rather a work of God that is received by faith, which &quot;clings to the water&quot;.

====Methodism====

The Methodist Articles of Religion, with regard to baptism, teach:

While baptism imparts grace, Methodists teach that a personal acceptance of Jesus Christ (the first work of grace) is essential to one&#x27;s salvation; during the second work of grace, entire sanctification, a believer is purified of original sin and made holy. As such, in the Methodist tradition, Baptism with the Holy Spirit has referred to the second work of grace, entire sanctification (Christian perfection).

In the Methodist Churches, baptism is a sacrament of initiation into the visible Church. Wesleyan covenant theology further teaches that baptism is a sign and a seal of the covenant of grace:

Methodists recognize three modes of baptism as being valid—&quot;immersion, sprinkling, or pouring&quot; in the name of the Holy Trinity.

====Moravianism====
The Moravian Church teaches that baptism is a sign and a seal, recognizing three modes of baptism as being valid: immersion, aspersion, and affusion.

====Reformed Protestantism====
In Reformed baptismal theology, baptism is seen as primarily God&#x27;s offer of union with Christ and all his benefits to the baptized. This offer is believed to be intact even when it is not received in faith by the person baptized. Reformed theologians believe the Holy Spirit brings into effect the promises signified in baptism. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. Baptism also initiates one into the visible church and the covenant of grace. Baptism is seen as a replacement of circumcision, which is considered the rite of initiation into the covenant of grace in the Old Testament.

Reformed Christians believe that immersion is not necessary for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, with no allowance for emergency baptism, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church, accept the validity of baptisms performed with them and do not rebaptize.

====United Protestants====
In United Protestant Churches, such as the United Church of Canada, Church of North India, Church of Pakistan, Church of South India, Protestant Church in the Netherlands, Uniting Church in Australia and United Church of Christ in Japan, baptism is a sacrament.

===Catholicism===
In Catholic teaching, baptism is stated to be &quot;necessary for salvation by actual reception or at least by desire&quot;. Catholic discipline requires the baptism ceremony to be performed by deacons, priests, or bishops, but in an emergency such as danger of death, anyone can licitly baptize. This teaching is based on the Gospel according to John which says that Jesus proclaimed: &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.&quot; It dates back to the teachings and practices of 1st-century Christians, and the connection between salvation and baptism was not, on the whole, an item of major dispute until Huldrych Zwingli denied the necessity of baptism, which he saw as merely a sign granting admission to the Christian community. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that &quot;Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament.&quot; The Council of Trent also states in the &quot;Decree Concerning Justification&quot; from session six that baptism is necessary for salvation. A person who knowingly, willfully and unrepentantly rejects baptism has no hope of salvation. However, if knowledge is absent, &quot;those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church, yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience.&quot;

The Catechism of the Catholic Church also states: &quot;Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more exorcisms are pronounced over the candidate&quot;. In the Roman Rite of the baptism of a child, the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: &quot;Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). Through Christ our Lord.&quot;

In the Catholic Church by baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins. Baptism not only purifies from all sins, but also makes the neophyte &quot;a new creature&quot;, an adopted son of God, who has become a &quot;partaker of the divine nature&quot;, member of Christ and co-heir with him, and a temple of the Holy Spirit. Given once for all, baptism cannot be repeated: just as a man can be born only once, so he is baptized only once. For this reason the holy Fathers added to the Nicene Creed the words &quot;We acknowledge one Baptism&quot;. Sanctifying grace, the grace of justification, given by God by baptism, erases the original sin and personal actual sins.

The power of Baptism consists in cleansing a man from all his sins as regards both guilt and punishment, for which reason no penance is imposed on those who receive Baptism, no matter how great their sins may have been. And if they were to die immediately after Baptism, they would rise at once to eternal life.

In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church a valid baptism requires, according to Canon 758 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the baptizer to pronounce the formula &quot;I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot; while putting the baptized in contact with water. The contact may be immersion, &quot;affusion&quot; (pouring), or &quot;aspersion&quot; (sprinkling). The formula requires &quot;name&quot; to be singular, emphasising the monotheism of the Trinity. It is claimed that Pope Stephen I, Ambrose and Pope Nicholas I declared that baptisms in the name of &quot;Jesus&quot; only as well as in the name of &quot;Father, Son and Holy Spirit&quot; were valid. The correct interpretation of their words is disputed. Current canonical law requires the Trinitarian formula and water for validity. The formula requires &quot;I baptize&quot; rather than &quot;we baptize&quot;, as clarified by a responsum of June 24, 2020. In 2022 the Diocese of Phoenix accepted the resignation of a parish priest whose use of &quot;we baptize&quot; had invalidated &quot;thousands of baptisms over more than 20 years&quot;. Note that in the Byzantine Rite the formula is in the passive voice, &quot;The servant of God N. is baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

Offspring of practicing Catholic parents are typically baptized as infants. Baptism is part of the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, provided for converts from non-Christian backgrounds and others not baptized as infants. Baptism by non-Catholic Christians is valid if the formula and water are present, and so converts from other Christian denominations are not given a Catholic baptism.

The church recognizes two equivalents of baptism with water: &quot;baptism of blood&quot; and &quot;baptism of desire&quot;. Baptism of blood is that undergone by unbaptized individuals who are martyred for their faith, while baptism of desire generally applies to catechumens who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:

The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This &quot;Baptism of blood&quot;, like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament.
:— 1258

For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament.
:— 1259

The Catholic Church holds that those who are ignorant of Christ&#x27;s Gospel and of the church, but who seek the truth and do God&#x27;s will as they understand it, may be supposed to have an implicit desire for baptism and can be saved: Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.&#x27; Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity.&quot; As for unbaptized infants, the church is unsure of their fate; &quot;the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God&quot;.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
In Eastern Orthodoxy, baptism is considered a sacrament and mystery which transforms the old and sinful person into a new and pure one, where the old life, the sins, any mistakes made are gone and a clean slate is given. In Greek and Russian Orthodox traditions, it is taught that through Baptism a person is united to the Body of Christ by becoming an official member of the Orthodox Church. During the service, the Orthodox priest blesses the water to be used. The catechumen (the one baptised) is fully immersed in the water three times in the name of the Trinity. This is considered to be a death of the &quot;old man&quot; by participation in the crucifixion and burial of Christ, and a rebirth into new life in Christ by participation in his resurrection. Properly a new name is given, which becomes the person&#x27;s name.

Babies of Orthodox families are normally baptized shortly after birth. Older converts to Orthodoxy are usually formally baptized into the Orthodox Church, though exceptions are sometimes made. Those who choose to convert from a different religion to Eastern Orthodoxy typically undergo Chrismation, known as confirmation in the Roman Catholic Church.

Properly and generally, the Mystery of Baptism is administered by bishops and other priests; however, in emergencies any Orthodox Christian can baptize. In such cases, should the person survive the emergency, it is likely that the person will be properly baptized by a priest at some later date. This is not considered to be a second baptism, nor is it imagined that the person is not already Orthodox, but rather it is a fulfillment of the proper form.

The service of baptism in Greek Orthodox (and other Eastern Orthodox) churches has remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. This fact is witnessed to by Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386), who, in his &quot;Discourse on the Sacrament of Baptism&quot;, describes the service in much the same way as is currently in use.

===Other groups===

====Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses====
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that baptism should be performed by complete immersion (submersion) in water and only when an individual is old enough to understand its significance. They believe that water baptism is an outward symbol that a person has made an unconditional dedication through Jesus Christ to do the will of God. Only after baptism, is a person considered a full-fledged Witness, and an official member of the Christian Congregation. They consider baptism to constitute ordination as a minister.

Prospective candidates for baptism must express their desire to be baptized well in advance of a planned baptismal event, to allow for congregation elders to assess their suitability (regarding true repentance and conversion). Elders approve candidates for baptism if the candidates are considered to understand what is expected of members of the religion and to demonstrate sincere dedication to the faith.

Most baptisms among Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are performed at scheduled assemblies and conventions by elders and ministerial servants, in special pools, or sometimes oceans, rivers, or lakes, depending on circumstances, and rarely occur at local Kingdom Halls. Prior to baptism, at the conclusion of a pre-baptism talk, candidates must affirm two questions:
Only baptized males (elders or ministerial servants) may baptize new members. Baptizers and candidates wear swimsuits or other informal clothing for baptism, but are directed to avoid clothing that is considered undignified or too revealing. Generally, candidates are individually immersed by a single baptizer, unless a candidate has special circumstances such as a physical disability. In circumstances of extended isolation, a qualified candidate&#x27;s dedication and stated intention to become baptized may serve to identify him as a member of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, even if immersion itself must be delayed. In rare instances, unbaptized males who had stated such an intention have reciprocally baptized each other, with both baptisms accepted as valid. Individuals who had been baptized in the 1930s and 1940s by female Witnesses due to extenuating circumstances, such as in concentration camps, were later re-baptized but still recognized their original baptism dates.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====

In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), baptism is recognized as the first of several ordinances (rituals) of the gospel. In Mormonism, baptism has the main purpose of remitting the sins of the participant. It is followed by confirmation, which inducts the person into membership in the church and constitutes a baptism with the Holy Spirit. Latter-day Saints believe that baptism must be by full immersion, and by a precise ritualized ordinance: if some part of the participant is not fully immersed, or the ordinance was not recited verbatim, the ritual must be repeated. It typically occurs in a baptismal font.

In addition, members of the LDS Church do not believe a baptism is valid unless it is performed by a Latter-day Saint one who has proper authority (a priest or elder). Authority is passed down through a form of apostolic succession. All new converts to the faith must be baptized or re-baptized. Baptism is seen as symbolic both of Jesus&#x27; death, burial and resurrection and is also symbolic of the baptized individual discarding their &quot;natural&quot; self and donning a new identity as a disciple of Jesus.

According to Latter-day Saint theology, faith and repentance are prerequisites to baptism. The ritual does not cleanse the participant of original sin, as Latter-day Saints do not believe the doctrine of original sin. Mormonism rejects infant baptism and baptism must occur after the age of accountability, defined in Latter-day Saint scripture as eight years old.

Latter-day Saint theology also teaches baptism for the dead in which deceased ancestors are baptized vicariously by the living, and believe that their practice is what Paul wrote of in Corinthians 15:29. This occurs in Latter-day Saint temples.

==== Freemasonry ====
Due to tensions between the Roman Catholic Church and Freemasons in France in the aftermath of the French Revolution, French Freemasons developed rituals to replace those of the Church, including baptism. Chrétien-Guillaume Riebesthal&#x27;s &quot;Rituel Maçonnique pour tous les Rites&quot; (Masonic Ritual for All Rites), published in Strasbourg in 1826, includes one such baptismal rite.&quot;Some Ceremony Peculiar to Themselves&quot;: The Continuation of a European Masonic Ceremony in Nineteenth-Century Wisconsin Lodges in Louisiana and Wisconsin performed baptism ceremonies in 1859, though they were widely condemned by their Grand Lodges.

In 1865, Albert Pike, publicly performed a ceremony of Masonic baptism in New York City. The ceremony was greeted with skepticism by many American Masons including Albert Mackey. A ceremony for Masonic baptism was published by Charles T. McClenechan in 1884.

==Non-practitioners==

===Quakers===
Quakers (members of the Religious Society of Friends) do not believe in the baptism of either children or adults with water, rejecting all forms of outward sacraments in their religious life. Robert Barclay&#x27;s &quot;Apology for the True Christian Divinity&quot; (a historic explanation of Quaker theology from the 17th century), explains Quakers&#x27; opposition to baptism with water thus:

Barclay argued that water baptism was only something that happened until the time of Christ, but that now, people are baptised inwardly by the spirit of Christ, and hence there is no need for the external sacrament of water baptism, which Quakers argue is meaningless.

===Salvation Army===
The Salvation Army does not practice water baptism, or indeed other outward sacraments. William Booth and Catherine Booth, the founders of the Salvation Army, believed that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. They believed what was important was spiritual grace itself. However, although the Salvation Army does not practice baptism, they are not opposed to baptism within other Christian denominations.

===Hyperdispensationalism===
There are some Christians termed &quot;Hyperdispensationalists&quot; (Mid-Acts dispensationalism) who accept only Paul&#x27;s Epistles as directly applicable for the church today. They do not accept water baptism as a practice for the church since Paul who was God&#x27;s apostle to the nations was not sent to baptize. Ultradispensationalists (Acts 28 dispensationalism) who do not accept the practice of the Lord&#x27;s supper, do not practice baptism because these are not found in the Prison Epistles. Both sects believe water baptism was a valid practice for covenant Israel. Hyperdispensationalists also teach that Peter&#x27;s gospel message was not the same as Paul&#x27;s. Hyperdispensationalists assert:
* The great commission and its baptism is directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later.
* The baptism of Acts 2:36–38 is Peter&#x27;s call for Israel to repent of complicity in the death of their Messiah; not as a Gospel announcement of atonement for sin, a later doctrine revealed by Paul.

Water baptism found early in the Book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism foretold by John the Baptist. Others make a distinction between John&#x27;s prophesied baptism by Christ with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit&#x27;s baptism of the believer into the body of Christ; the latter being the one baptism for today. The one baptism for today, it is asserted, is the &quot;baptism of the Holy Spirit&quot; of the believer into the Body of Christ church.

Many in this group also argue that John&#x27;s promised baptism by fire is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire.

Other Hyperdispensationalists believe that baptism was necessary until mid-Acts.

===Debaptism===

Most Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be neither repeated nor undone. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by rejecting religion entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing debaptism.

==Comparative summary==

A comparative summary of the practice of baptism throughout various Christian denominations is given below. (This section does not give a complete listing of denominations, and therefore, it only mentions a fraction of the churches practicing &quot;believer&#x27;s baptism&quot;.)

==Baptism of objects==

The word &quot;baptism&quot; or &quot;christening&quot; is sometimes used to describe the naming or inauguration of certain objects for use.

===Boats and ships===

&quot;Baptism of Ships&quot;: since at least the time of the Crusades, rituals have contained a blessing for ships. The priest asks God to bless the vessel and protect those who sail on it. The ship is usually sprinkled with holy water.

===Church bells===
The name &quot;Baptism of Bells&quot; has been given to the blessing of (musical, especially church) bells, at least in France, since the 11th century. It is derived from the washing of the bell with holy water by the bishop, before he anoints it with the oil of the infirm without and with chrism within; a fuming censer is placed under it and the bishop prays that these sacramentals of the church may, at the sound of the bell, put the demons to flight, protect from storms, and call the faithful to prayer.

===Dolls===
&quot;Baptism of Dolls&quot;: the custom of &#x27;dolly dunking&#x27; was once a common practice in parts of the United Kingdom, particularly in Cornwall where it has been revived in recent years.

==Other initiation ceremonies==

Many cultures practice or have practiced initiation rites, with or without the use of water, including the ancient Egyptian, the Hebraic/Jewish, the Babylonian, the Mayan, and the Norse cultures. The modern Japanese practice of Miyamairi is such a ceremony that does not use water. In some, such evidence may be archaeological and descriptive in nature, rather than a modern practice.

===Mystery religion initiation rites===
Many scholars have drawn parallels between rites from mystery religions and baptism in Christianity. Apuleius, a 2nd-century Roman writer, described an initiation into the mysteries of Isis. The initiation was preceded by a normal bathing in the public baths and a ceremonial sprinkling by the priest of Isis, after which the candidate was given secret instructions in the temple of the goddess. The candidate then fasted for ten days from meat and wine, after which he was dressed in linen and led at night into the innermost part of the sanctuary, where the actual initiation took place, the details of which were secret. On the next two days, dressed in the robes of his consecration, he participated in feasting. Apuleius describes also an initiation into the cult of Osiris and yet a third initiation, of the same pattern as the initiation into the cult of Isis, without mention of a preliminary bathing. The water-less initiations of Lucius, the character in Apuleius&#x27;s story who had been turned into an ass and changed back by Isis into human form, into the successive degrees of the rites of the goddess was accomplished only after a significant period of study to demonstrate his loyalty and trustworthiness, akin to catechumenal practices preceding baptism in Christianity.

Jan Bremmer has written on the putative connection between rites from mystery religions and baptism:

There are thus some verbal parallels between early Christianity and the Mysteries, but the situation is rather different as regards early Christian ritual practice. Much ink was spilled around 1900 arguing that the rituals of baptism and of the Last Supper derived from the ancient Mysteries, but Nock and others after him have easily shown that these attempts grossly misinterpreted the sources. Baptism is clearly rooted in Jewish purificatory rituals, and cult meals are so widespread in antiquity that any specific derivation is arbitrary. It is truly surprising to see how long the attempts to find some pagan background to these two Christian sacraments have persevered. Secularising ideologies clearly played an important part in these interpretations but, nevertheless, they have helped to clarify the relations between nascent Christianity and its surroundings.

Thus the practice is derivative, whether from Judaism, the Mysteries or a combination (see the reference to Hellenistic Judaism in the Etymology section.)

===Gnostic Catholicism and Thelema===
The Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, or Gnostic Catholic Church (the ecclesiastical arm of Ordo Templi Orientis), offers its Rite of Baptism to any person at least 11 years old.

===Mandaean baptism===

Mandaeans revere John the Baptist and practice frequent baptism (&quot;masbuta&quot;) as a ritual of purification, not of initiation. They are possibly the earliest people to practice baptism. Mandaeans undergo baptism on Sundays (&quot;Habshaba&quot;), wearing a white sacral robe (&quot;rasta&quot;). Baptism for Mandaeans consists of a triple full immersion in water, a triple &quot;signing&quot; of the forehead with water and a triple drinking of water. The priest (&quot;Rabbi&quot;) then removes a ring made of myrtle worn by the baptized and places it on their forehead. This is then followed by a handshake (&quot;kushta&quot;, &quot;hand of truth&quot;) with the priest. The final blessing involves the priest laying his right hand on the baptized person&#x27;s head. &quot;Living water&quot; (fresh, natural, flowing water) is a requirement for baptism, therefore can only take place in rivers. All rivers are named Jordan (&quot;yardena&quot;) and are believed to be nourished by the &quot;World of Light&quot;. By the river bank, a Mandaean&#x27;s forehead is anointed with sesame oil (&quot;misha&quot;) and partakes in a communion of bread (&quot;pihta&quot;) and water. Baptism for Mandaeans allows for salvation by connecting with the &quot;World of Light&quot; and for forgiveness of sins.

===Sethian baptism===

The Sethian baptismal rite is known as the Five Seals, in which the initiate is immersed five times in running water.

===Yazidi baptism===

Yazidi baptism is called &quot;mor kirin&quot; (literally: &quot;to seal&quot;). Traditionally, Yazidi children are baptised at birth with water from the &quot;Kaniya Sipî&quot; (&quot;White Spring&quot;) at Lalish. It essentially consists of pouring holy water from the spring on the child&#x27;s head three times.

===Islamic practice of wudu===
Many Islamic scholars such as Shaikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen have compared the Islamic practice of wudu to a baptism. Wudu is a practice that Muslims practice to go from ritual impurity to ritual purity. Ritual purity is required for Salah (praying) and also to hold a physical copy of the Qur’an, and so wudu is often done before salah. However, it is permissible to pray more than one salah without repeating wudu, as long as ritual purity is not broken, for example by using the bathroom.

Another similar purification ritual is ghusl, which takes someone from major ritual impurity (janabah) to lesser ritual impurity, which is then purified by wudu. If one is in a state of janabah, both ghusl and wudu are required if one wants to pray.

Although original sin does not exist in Islam, wudu is widely regarded to remove sins. In a Sahih hadith, Muhammad says &quot;Whenever a man performs his ablution intending to pray and he washes his hands, the sins of his hands fall down with the first drop. When he rinses his mouth and nose, the sins of his tongue and lips fall down with the first drop. When he washes his face, the sins of his hearing and sight fall down with the first drop. When he washes his arms to his elbows and his feet to his ankles, he is purified from every sin and fault like the day he was born from his mother. If he stands for prayer, Allah will raise his status by a degree. If he sits, he will sit in peace.&quot;

===Baptism in the Yadav community===

People of the Yadav community of Hindu religion follow baptism, where it is called Karah Pujan. In this, the person who is being baptized is bathed in boiling Milk. The newborn baby is also included in this process, in which he is bathed with boiling milk and then he is garlanded with flowers.

<doc id="4300" wikidata="Q33135384" url="?curid=4300" title="Bocce">
<text> (, or , ), sometimes anglicized as bocce ball, bocci, or boccie, is a ball sport belonging to the boules family. Developed into its present form in Italy, it is closely related to English bowls and French , with a common ancestry from ancient games played in the Roman Empire. Bocce is played around Western, Southern, and Southeastern Europe, as well as in overseas areas with historical Italian immigrant population, including Australia, North America, and South America, principally Argentina and the southern Brazilian states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Initially only played by Italian immigrants, the game has slowly gained popularity among descendant generations and outside the Italian diaspora. 

==History==

Having developed from games played in the Roman Empire, Bocce developed into its present form in Italy, where it is called &#x27;, the plural of the Italian word &#x27; which means &#x27;bowl&#x27; in the general sporting sense, it spread around Europe and also in regions to which Italians have migrated. The first form of regulation was described in the book &quot;Gioco delle bocchie&quot; by Raffaele Bisteghi in 1753. In South America it is known as &#x27;, or &quot;bolas criollas&quot; (&#x27;Criollo balls&#x27;) in Venezuela, and &#x27; in southern Brazil. The accessibility of bocce to people of all ages and abilities has seen it grow in popularity among Special Olympics programmes globally and it is now the third most played sport among Special Olympics athletes.

==Geographical spread==

The sport is also very popular on the eastern side of the Adriatic, especially in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the sport is known in Serbo-Croatian as &#x27; (&#x27;playing &#x27;&#x27;) or &#x27; (colloquially also &#x27;). In Slovenia the sport is known as &#x27; or colloquially &#x27;playing &#x27;&#x27;, or &#x27; (from Italian &#x27; and Venetian &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;balls&#x27;). There are numerous bocce leagues in the United States. 

==Rules and play==

Bocce is traditionally played on a natural soil or asphalt court up to in length and wide. While the court walls are traditionally made of wood or stone, many social leagues and Special Olympics programs now use inflatable &#x27;Packabocce&#x27; PVC courts due to their portability and ease of storage. Bocce balls can be made of wood (traditional), metal, baked clay, or various kinds of plastic. Unlike lawn bowls, bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias.
A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the jack (called a &#x27; (&#x27;little bocce&#x27;) or &#x27; (&#x27;bullet&#x27; or &#x27;little ball&#x27;) in Italian, depending on local custom, from one end of the court into a zone in length, ending from the far end of the court. If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone. Casual play is common in reasonably flat areas of parks and yards lacking a Bocce court, but players should agree to the minimum and maximum distance the jack may be thrown before play begins.

The side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does &quot;not&quot; have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its remaining balls. The object of the game is for a team to get as many of its balls as possible closer to the target ball (jack, boccino, pallino) than the opposing team. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically from 7 to 13 points.

Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action only. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately.

==Variants==

===Bocce volo===
A variation called &#x27; uses a metal ball, which is thrown overhand (palm down), after a run-up to the throwing line. In that latter respect, it is similar to the French boules game &#x27; also known as &#x27; which is internationally called sport-boules. Another French variant of the game is called &#x27;, and (lacking the run-up) is more similar in some respects to traditional &quot;.

===Boccia===

Another development, for persons with disabilities, is called &quot;. It is a shorter-range game, played with leather balls on an indoor, smooth surface. Boccia was first introduced to the Paralympics at the 1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Summer Games, and is one of the only two Paralympic sports that do not have an Olympic counterpart (the other being goalball).

<doc id="4301" wikidata="Q813229" url="?curid=4301" title="Beatmatching">
<text>Beatmatching or pitch cue is a disc jockey technique of pitch shifting or time stretching an upcoming track to match its tempo to that of the currently playing track, and to adjust them such that the beats (and, usually, the bars) are synchronized—e.g. the kicks and snares in two house records hit at the same time when both records are played simultaneously. Beatmatching is a component of beatmixing which employs beatmatching combined with equalization, attention to phrasing and track selection in an attempt to make a single mix that flows together and has a good structure.

The technique was developed to keep the people from leaving the dancefloor at the end of the song. These days it is considered basic among disc jockeys (DJs) in electronic dance music genres, and it is standard practice in clubs to keep the constant beat through the night, even if DJs change in the middle.

==Technique==

The beatmatching technique consists of the following steps:

# While a record is playing, start a second record playing, but only monitored through headphones, not being fed to the main PA system. Use gain (or &quot;trim&quot;) control on the mixer to match the levels of the two records.
# Restart and slip-cue the new record at the right time, on beat with the record currently playing.
# If the beat on the new record hits before the beat on the current record, then the new record is too fast; reduce the pitch and manually slow the speed of the new record to bring the beats back in sync.
# If the beat on the new record hits after the beat on the current record, then the new record is too slow; increase the pitch and manually increase the speed of the new record to bring the beats back in sync.
# Continue this process until the two records are in sync with each other. It can be difficult to sync the two records perfectly, so manual adjustment of the records is necessary to maintain the beat synchronization.
# Gradually fade in parts of the new track while fading out the old track. While in the mix, ensure that the tracks are still synchronized, adjusting the records if needed.
# The fade can be repeated several times, for example, from the first track, fade to the second track, then back to first, then to second again.

One of the key things to consider when beatmatching is the tempo of both songs, and the musical theory behind the songs. Attempting to beatmatch songs with completely different beats per minute (BPM) will result in one of the songs sounding too fast or too slow.

When beatmatching, a popular technique is to vary the equalization of both tracks. For example, when the kicks are occurring on the same beat, a more seamless transition can occur if the lower frequencies are taken out of one of the songs, and the lower frequencies of the other song is boosted. Doing so creates a smoother transition.

===Pitch and tempo===
The pitch and tempo of a track are normally linked together: spin a disc 5% faster and both pitch and tempo will be 5% higher. However, some modern DJ software can change pitch and tempo independently using time-stretching and pitch-shifting, allowing harmonic mixing. There is also a feature in modern DJ software which may be called &quot;master tempo&quot; or &quot;key adjust&quot; which changes the tempo while keeping the original pitch.

==History==
Francis Grasso was one of the first people to beatmatch in the late 1960s, being taught the technique by Bob Lewis.

These days beat-matching is considered central to DJing, and features making it possible are a requirement for DJ-oriented players. In 1978, the Technics SL-1200MK2 turntable was released, whose comfortable and precise sliding pitch control and high torque direct drive motor made beat-matching easier and it became the standard among DJs. With the advent of the compact disc, DJ-oriented compact disc players with pitch control and other features enabling beat-matching (and sometimes scratching), dubbed CDJs, were introduced by various companies. More recently, software with similar capabilities has been developed to allow manipulation of digital audio files stored on computers using turntables with special vinyl records (e.g. Final Scratch, M-Audio Torq, Serato Scratch Live) or computer interface (e.g. Traktor DJ Studio, Mixxx, VirtualDJ). Other software including algorithmic beat-matching is Ableton Live, which allows for realtime music manipulation and deconstruction. Freeware software such as Rapid Evolution can detect the beats per minute and determine the percent BPM difference between songs.

Most modern DJ hardware and software now offer a &quot;sync&quot; feature which automatically adjusts the tempo between tracks being mixed so the DJ no longer needs to beatmatch manually.

<text>Bealtaine (anglicised as &#x27;Beltane&#x27;)
(; , approximately ) is the Gaelic May Day festival, marking the beginning of summer. It is traditionally held on 1 May, or about midway between the spring equinox and summer solstice. Historically, it was widely observed in Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Man. In Ireland, the name for the festival in both Irish and English is (). In Scottish Gaelic it is called (), and in Manx Gaelic /. Beltane is one of the four main Gaelic seasonal festivals—along with Samhain, Imbolc, and Lughnasadh—and is similar to the Welsh .

Beltane is mentioned in the earliest Irish literature and is associated with important events in Irish mythology. Also known as (&#x27;first of summer&#x27;), it marked the beginning of summer and was when cattle were driven out to the summer pastures. Rituals were performed to protect cattle, people and crops, and to encourage growth. Special bonfires were kindled, whose flames, smoke and ashes were deemed to have protective powers. The people and their cattle would walk around or between bonfires, and sometimes leap over the flames or embers. All household fires would be doused and then re-lit from the Beltane bonfire. These gatherings would be accompanied by a feast, and some of the food and drink would be offered to the . Doors, windows, byres and livestock would be decorated with yellow May flowers, perhaps because they evoked fire. In parts of Ireland, people would make a May Bush: typically a thorn bush or branch decorated with flowers, ribbons, bright shells and rushlights. Holy wells were also visited, while Beltane dew was thought to bring beauty and maintain youthfulness. Many of these customs were part of May Day or Midsummer festivals in parts of Great Britain and Europe.

Public celebrations of Beltane fell out of popularity by the 20th century, though some customs continue to be revived as local cultural events. Since the late 20th century, Celtic neopagans and Wiccans have observed a festival based on Beltane as a religious holiday. Neopagans in the southern hemisphere may mark the festival on 1 November.

==Name==
In Old Irish, the name was usually or . In modern Irish, the festival is usually called (&quot;day of Beltane&quot;), while the month of May is (&quot;month of Beltane&quot;). In Scottish Gaelic, the festival is . Sometimes the older Scottish Gaelic spelling is used. The term (Scottish) or (Irish), &quot;the bright or yellow day of Beltane&quot;, means the first of May. In Ireland it is referred to in a common folk tale as ; the first day of the week (Monday/) is added to highlight the first day of summer.

The name is anglicised as Beltane, Beltain, Beltaine, Beltine and Beltany.

Another Old Irish name for the festival was or , probably meaning &#x27;first of summer&#x27;. Ó Duinnín&#x27;s Irish dictionary (1904) gives this as or in modern Irish. It survives in the Scottish Gaelic name for the month of May, , and matches the Welsh . These have all been derived from proto-Celtic (first + summer).

===Etymology===
&quot;Beltane&quot; is proposed to derive from a proto-Celtic , meaning &#x27;bright fire&#x27;. The element might be cognate with the English word &quot;bale&quot; (as in ) meaning &#x27;white&#x27;, &#x27;bright&#x27; or &#x27;shining&#x27;. The absence of syncope (Irish sound laws rather predict a **&quot;Beltne&quot; form) can be explained by the popular belief that &quot;Beltaine&quot; was a compound of the word for &#x27;fire&#x27;, &quot;tene&quot;.

===Toponymy===

There are place names in Ireland containing the word , indicating places where Beltane festivities were once held. It is often anglicised as &quot;Beltany&quot;. There are three Beltanys in County Donegal, including the Beltany stone circle, and two in County Tyrone. In County Armagh there is a place called Tamnaghvelton/ (&#x27;the Beltane field&#x27;). Lisbalting/ (&#x27;the Beltane ringfort&#x27;) is in County Tipperary, while Glasheennabaultina/ (&#x27;the Beltane stream&#x27;) is the name of a stream joining the River Galey in County Limerick.

==Historic customs==
Beltane was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: Samhain (1 November), Imbolc (1 February), Beltane (1 May), and Lughnasadh (1 August). Beltane marked the beginning of the pastoral summer season, when livestock were driven out to the summer pastures. Rituals were held at that time to protect them from harm, both natural and supernatural, and this mainly involved the &quot;symbolic use of fire&quot;. There were also rituals to protect crops, dairy products and people, and to encourage growth. The (often referred to as spirits or fairies) were thought to be especially active at Beltane (as at Samhain), and the goal of many Beltane rituals was to appease them. Most scholars see the as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits. Beltane was a &quot;spring time festival of optimism&quot; during which &quot;fertility ritual again was important, perhaps connecting with the waxing power of the sun&quot;.

===Ancient and medieval===
Beltane (the beginning of summer) and Samhain (the beginning of winter) are thought to have been the most important of the four Celtic festivals. Sir James George Frazer wrote in &quot;The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion&quot; that the times of Beltane and Samhain are of little importance to European crop-growers, but of great importance to herdsmen practising seasonal transhumance. Thus, he suggests that the festival has pastoral origins.

The earliest mention of Beltane is in Old Irish literature from Gaelic Ireland. According to the early medieval texts written by Cormac mac Cuilennáin and , Belltaine &#x27;May-day&#x27; i.e. bil-tene i.e. lucky fire was held on 1 May and marked the beginning of summer. The texts say that, to protect cattle from disease, druids would make two fires &quot;with great incantations&quot; and drive the cattle between them.
This text also mentions Belltaine in relation to the Idol God Bil from Bial in which &#x27;a fire was kindled in his name at the beginning of summer always, and cattle were driven between the two fires&#x27;.

According to 17th-century historian Geoffrey Keating, there was a great gathering at the hill of Uisneach each Beltane in medieval Ireland, where a sacrifice was made to a god named Beil. Keating wrote that two bonfires would be lit in every district of Ireland, and cattle would be driven between them to protect them from disease. There is no reference to such a gathering in the annals, but the medieval &quot;Dindsenchas&quot; (lore of places) includes a tale of a hero lighting a holy fire on Uisneach that blazed for seven years. Ronald Hutton writes that this may &quot;preserve a tradition of Beltane ceremonies there&quot;, but adds &quot;Keating or his source may simply have conflated this legend with the information in &quot;Sanas Chormaic&quot; to produce a piece of pseudo-history&quot;. Nevertheless, excavations at Uisneach in the 20th century found evidence of large fires and charred bones, and showed it to have been a place of ritual since ancient times. Evidence suggests it was &quot;a sanctuary-site, in which fire was kept burning perpetually, or kindled at frequent intervals&quot;, where animal sacrifices were offered.

Beltane is also mentioned in medieval Scottish literature. An early reference is found in the poem &#x27;Peblis to the Play&#x27;, contained in the Maitland Manuscripts of 15th- and 16th-century Scots poetry, which describes the celebration in the town of Peebles.

===Modern era===
From the late 18th century to the mid 20th century, many accounts of Beltane customs were recorded by folklorists and other writers. For example John Jamieson, in his &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language&quot; (1808), describes some of the Beltane customs which persisted in the 18th and early 19th centuries in parts of Scotland, which he noted were beginning to die out.

====Bonfires====

Bonfires continued to be a key part of the festival in the modern era. All hearth fires would be doused before the bonfire was lit, generally on a hill. Ronald Hutton writes that &quot;To increase the potency of the holy flames, in Britain at least they were often kindled by the most primitive of all means, of friction between wood.&quot; This is known as a need-fire, or &quot;tein&#x27; èiginn&quot; in Gaelic. It was a sacred fire that could be kindled only with a wooden drill, by a group of certain people (usually nine men), after they had removed all metal and after all other fires in the area had been doused. Nineteenth-century writers record such fires being kindled at Beltane in the Scottish Highlands, and also in Wales. Its flames were believed to guard against sickness, supernatural harm and witchcraft.

In the 19th century, cattle were still driven over flames or between two fires—as described in &quot;Sanas Cormaic&quot; almost 1000 years before—in parts of Ireland and Scotland. Sometimes the cattle would be driven around a bonfire or be made to leap over flames or embers. The people themselves did likewise for good luck and protection. On the Isle of Man, people ensured that the smoke blew over them and their cattle.

When the bonfire died down, people would daub themselves with its ashes and sprinkle it over their crops and livestock. Burning torches from the bonfire would be taken home, carried around the house or boundary of the farmstead, and used to re-light the hearth. From these rituals, it is clear that the fire was seen as having protective powers. Similar rituals were part of May Day or Midsummer customs in some other parts of the British Isles and mainland Europe. Frazer believed the fire rituals are a kind of imitative or sympathetic magic. He suggests they were meant to mimic the Sun and &quot;ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men, animals, and plants&quot;, as well as to symbolically &quot;burn up and destroy all harmful influences&quot;.
Food was also cooked at the bonfire and there were rituals involving it. In the Scottish Highlands, Alexander Carmichael recorded that there was a feast featuring lamb, and that formerly this lamb was sacrificed. In 1769, Thomas Pennant wrote of Beltane bonfires in Perthshire, where a caudle made from eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk was cooked. Some of the mixture was poured on the ground as a libation. Everyone would then take an oatmeal cake, called a or &quot;Beltane bannock&quot;, which had nine knobs on it. Each person would face the fire, break off a knob one-by-one and throw it over their shoulder, offering them to the spirits to protect their livestock (one to protect the horses, one to protect the sheep, and so forth) and to the predators that might harm their livestock (one to the fox, one to the eagle, and so forth). Afterwards, they would drink the caudle.

According to 18th-century writers, in parts of Scotland there was another ritual involving the Beltane bannock. The cake would be cut and one of the slices marked with charcoal. The slices would then be put in a bonnet and everyone would take one out while blindfolded. According to one writer, whoever got the marked piece had to leap through the fire three times. According to another, those present pretended to throw the person into the fire and, for some time afterwards, would speak of them as if they were dead. This &quot;may embody a memory of actual human sacrifice&quot;, or it may have always been symbolic. There was an almost identical May Day (&quot;Calan Mai&quot;) tradition in parts of Wales, and mock-burnings were part of spring and summer bonfire festivals in other parts of Europe.

====Flowers and May Bushes====

Yellow and white flowers such as primrose, rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel, and marsh marigold were traditionally placed at doorways and windows; this is documented in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn at doors and windows and sometimes they were made into bouquets, garlands or crosses and fastened to them. Cows would also be decorated with them, and they would be fastened to equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.

The May Bush or May Bough was popular in parts of Ireland until the late 19th century. This was a small tree or branch—typically hawthorn, rowan, holly or sycamore—decorated with bright flowers, ribbons, painted shells or eggshells from Easter Sunday, and so forth. The tree would either be decorated where it stood, or branches would be decorated and placed inside or outside the house (particularly above windows and doors, on the roof, and on barns). It was generally the responsibility of the oldest person of the house to decorate the May Bush, and the tree would remain up until 31 May. The tree would also be decorated with candles or rushlights. Sometimes a May Bush would be paraded through the town. In parts of southern Ireland, gold and silver hurling balls known as May Balls would be hung on these May Bushes and handed out to children or given to the winners of a hurling match. In Dublin and Belfast, May Bushes were brought into town from the countryside and decorated by the whole neighbourhood. Each neighbourhood vied for the most handsome tree and, sometimes, residents of one would try to steal the May Bush of another. This led to the May Bush being outlawed in Victorian times. In some places, it was customary to sing and dance around the May Bush, and at the end of the festivities it may be burnt in the bonfire. In some areas the May Bush or Bough has also been called the &quot;May Pole&quot;, but it is the bush or tree described above, and not the more commonly-known European maypole.

Thorn trees are traditionally seen as special trees, associated with the . Frazer believed the customs of decorating trees or poles in springtime are a relic of tree worship and wrote: &quot;The intention of these customs is to bring home to the village, and to each house, the blessings which the tree-spirit has in its power to bestow.&quot; Emyr Estyn Evans suggests that the May Bush custom may have come to Ireland from England, because it seemed to be found in areas with strong English influence and because the Irish saw it as unlucky to damage certain thorn trees. However, &quot;lucky&quot; and &quot;unlucky&quot; trees varied by region, and it has been suggested that Beltane was the only time when cutting thorn trees was allowed. The practice of bedecking a May Bush with flowers, ribbons, garlands and bright shells is found among the Gaelic diaspora, most notably in Newfoundland, and in some Easter traditions on the East Coast of the United States.

==== Appeasing the fairies ====
Many Beltane practices were designed to ward off or appease the &quot;aos sí&quot; (often referred to as the fairies) and prevent them from stealing dairy products, which were thought to be especially at risk. For example, May flowers were tied to milk pails or the tails of cattle to ensure the cattle&#x27;s milk was not stolen, or three black coals might be placed under a butter churn to ensure the fairies did not steal the butter.

Food was left or milk poured at the doorstep or places associated with the , such as &#x27;fairy trees&#x27;, as an offering. However, milk was never given to a neighbour on May Day because it was feared that the milk would be transferred to the neighbour&#x27;s cow. 

In Ireland, cattle would be brought to &#x27;fairy forts&#x27;, where a small amount of their blood would be collected. The owners would then pour it into the earth with prayers for the herd&#x27;s safety. Sometimes the blood would be left to dry and then be burnt. 

To protect farm produce and encourage fertility, farmers would lead a procession around the boundaries of their farm. They would &quot;carry with them seeds of grain, implements of husbandry, the first well water, and the herb vervain (or rowan as a substitute). The procession generally stopped at the four cardinal points of the compass, beginning in the east, and rituals were performed in each of the four directions&quot;. People made the sign of the cross with milk for good luck on Beltane, and the sign of the cross was also made on the backsides of cattle.

====Beltane blessings====
In the 19th century, folklorist Alexander Carmichael (1832–1912), collected the Scottish Gaelic song (&quot;The Beltane Blessing&quot;) in his &quot;Carmina Gadelica&quot;, which he heard from a crofter in South Uist. The first two verses were sung as follows:

&lt;poem&gt; (Bless, O Threefold true and bountiful,)
 (Myself, my spouse and my family,)
 (My tender family and their beloved mother at their head,)
 (On the fragrant plain, at the gay mountain sheiling,)
 (On the fragrant plain, at the gay mountain sheiling.)

 (Everything within my dwelling or in my possession,)
 (All kin and crops, all flocks and corn,)
 (From Hallow Eve to Beltane Eve,)
 (With goodly progress and gentle blessing,)
 (From sea to sea, and every river mouth,)
 (From wave to wave, and base of waterfall.)&lt;/poem&gt;

====Other customs====
Holy wells were often visited at Beltane, and at the other Gaelic festivals of Imbolc and Lughnasadh. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking sunwise (moving from east to west) around the well. They would then leave offerings; typically coins or s (see clootie well). The first water drawn from a well on Beltane was thought to be especially potent, and would bring good luck to the person who drew it. Beltane morning dew was also thought to bring good luck and health. At dawn or before sunrise on Beltane, maidens would roll in the dew or wash their faces with it. The dew was collected in a jar, left in sunlight, then filtered. The dew was thought to increase sexual attractiveness, maintain youthfulness, protect from sun damage (particularly freckles and sunburn) and help with skin ailments for the ensuing year. It was also thought that a man who washed his face with soap and water on Beltane will grow long whiskers on his face.

It was widely believed that no one should light a fire on May Day morning until they saw smoke rising from a neighbour&#x27;s house. It was also believed to be bad luck to put out ashes or clothes on May Day, and to give away coal or ashes would cause the giver difficulty in lighting fires for the next year. Also, if the family owned a white horse, it should remain in the barn all day, and if any other horse was owned, a red rag should be tied to its tail. Any foal born on May Day was fated to kill a man, and any cow that calved on May Day would die. Any birth or marriage on May Day was generally believed to be ill-fated. On May Night a cake and a jug were left on the table, because it was believed that the Irish who had died abroad would return on May Day to their ancestral homes, and it was also believed that the dead returned on May Day to visit their friends. A robin that flew into the house on Beltane was believed to portend the death of a household member.

The festival persisted widely up until the 1950s, and in some places the celebration of Beltane continues today.

==Revival==

As a festival, Beltane had largely died out by the mid-20th century, although some of its customs continued and in some places it has been revived as a cultural event. In Ireland, Beltane fires were common until the mid-20th century, and has been revived as an annual festival in County Westmeath on the Hill of Uisneach since 2009. It culminates in a torchlit procession by participants in costume, some on horseback, and the lighting of a large bonfire at dusk. In 2017, the ceremonial fire was lit by the President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins.

The lighting of a community Beltane fire from which each hearth fire is then relit is observed today in some parts of the Gaelic diaspora, though in most of these cases it is a cultural revival rather than an unbroken survival of the ancient tradition. In parts of Newfoundland, the custom of decorating the May Bush also survives. The town of Peebles in the Scottish Borders holds a traditional week-long Beltane Fair every year in June, when a local girl is crowned Beltane Queen on the steps of the parish church. Like other Borders festivals, it incorporates a Common Riding.
Since 1988, a Beltane Fire Festival has been held every year on the night of 30 April on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, Scotland. While inspired by traditional Beltane, it is a modern celebration of summer&#x27;s beginning which draws on many influences. The performance art event involves fire dances and a procession by costumed performers, led by the May Queen and the Green Man, culminating in the lighting of a bonfire.

Butser Ancient Farm, an open-air archaeology museum in Hampshire, England, has also held a Beltane festival since the 1980s. The festival mixes historical reenactment with folk influences, and features a May Queen and Green Man, living history displays, reenactor battles, demonstrations of traditional crafts, performances of folk music, and Celtic storytelling. The festival ends with the burning of a 30–40 ft wickerman, with a new historical or folk-inspired design each year. Butser Ancient Farm acknowledges that their Beltane celebrations are not an attempt to reconstruct authentic historical pagan practices.

The 1970 recording &#x27;Ride a White Swan&#x27;, written and performed by Marc Bolan and his band T.Rex, contains the line &quot;Ride a white Swan like the people of the Beltane&quot;.

===Neopaganism===
Beltane and Beltane-based festivals are held by some Neopagans. As there are many kinds of Neopaganism, their Beltane celebrations can be very different despite the shared name. Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible. Other Neopagans base their celebrations on many sources, the Gaelic festival being only one of them.


Neopagans usually celebrate Beltane on 30 April – 1 May in the Northern Hemisphere and 31 October – 1 November in the Southern Hemisphere, beginning and ending at sunset. Some Neopagans celebrate it at the astronomical midpoint between the spring equinox and summer solstice (or the full moon nearest this point). In the Northern Hemisphere, this midpoint is when the ecliptic longitude of the Sun reaches 45 degrees.

====Celtic Reconstructionist====
Celtic Reconstructionists strive to reconstruct ancient Celtic religion. Their religious practices are based on research and historical accounts, but modified to suit modern life. They avoid syncretism and eclecticism (i.e. combining practises from unrelated cultures).

Celtic Reconstructionists usually celebrate Beltane when the local hawthorn trees are in bloom. Many observe the traditional bonfire rites, to whatever extent this is feasible where they live. This may involve passing themselves and their pets or livestock between two bonfires, and bringing home a candle lit from the bonfire. If they are unable to make a bonfire or attend a bonfire ceremony, candles may be used instead. They may decorate their homes with a May Bush, branches from blooming thorn trees, or equal-armed rowan crosses. Holy wells may be visited and offerings made to the spirits or deities of the wells. Traditional festival foods may also be prepared.

====Wicca====
Wiccans use the name &quot;Beltane&quot; or &quot;Beltain&quot; for their May Day celebrations. It is one of the yearly Sabbats of their Wheel of the Year, following Ostara and preceding Midsummer. Unlike Celtic Reconstructionism, Wicca is syncretic and melds practices from many different cultures. In general, the Wiccan Beltane is more akin to the Germanic/English May Day festival, both in its significance (focusing on fertility) and its rituals (such as maypole dancing). Some Wiccans enact a ritual union of the May Lord and May Lady.

<text>Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank of Palestine, located about south of Jerusalem. It is the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate, and as of had a population of people. The city&#x27;s economy is strongly linked to tourism, with a focus on the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.

A possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.

Later, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem&#x27;s walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.

While it was historically a city of Arab Christians, Bethlehem now has a majority of Arab Muslims; while it is still home to a significant population of Palestinian Christians, this community has dwindled significantly, from about 86 per cent in 1950 to about 10 per cent in 2022. Presently, Bethlehem has become encircled by dozens of Israeli settlements, which significantly hinder the ability of Palestinians in the city to openly access their land and livelihoods, which has contributed to the exodus of Palestinians.

==Etymology==
The current name for Bethlehem in local languages is /Bēt laḥm/ in Arabic (), literally meaning &quot;house of meat&quot;, and &quot;&quot; in Hebrew (), literally &quot;house of bread&quot; or &quot;house of food.&quot; The city was called in and in . In Aramaic, the name of Bethlehem was simply the Hebrew name בית לחם, and was pronounced as Beit Lekhem. Evidence for this spelling can be inferred based on the fact that the spelling ܒܝܬܠܚܡ can be found in the Syriac Aramaic version of the bible in Matthew 2 as well as other parts of the book. The letters ܒܝܬܠܚܡ transliterate to ביתלחם. Amarna letter EA290 makes reference to a town bīt-ninurta which has been read as Bit-Lachmi by scholar W. F. Albright, following a proposal by Otto Schroeder in 1815 and making it a potential first historical reference to Bethlehem. This reading is, however, uncertain and has met with objections.

===&quot;House of the god Lahmu&quot;===
Canaanite and Israelite toponyms starting with &quot;beth&quot; are interpreted to mean &quot;house of&quot;, with &#x27;house&#x27; understood as &#x27;temple&#x27; and the second part of the name indicating the deity the local temple was dedicated to. Accordingly, one longstanding suggestion in scholarship is that the name Bethlehem derives from the Mesopotamian or Canaanite fertility god Laḫmu and his consort sister Lahamu, &quot;lahmo&quot; being the Chaldean word for &quot;fertility&quot;. Biblical scholar William F. Albright believed that this hypothesis, first put forth by , was &quot;certainly accurate&quot;. Albright noted that the pronunciation of the name had remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, even if the perceived meaning had shifted over time: &quot;&#x27;Temple of the God Lakhmu&#x27; in Canaanite, &#x27;House of Bread&#x27; in Hebrew and Aramaic, &#x27;House of Meat&#x27; in Arabic.&quot; While Schröder&#x27;s theory is not widely accepted, it continues to find favour in academic literature over the later literal translations.

===&quot;House of war&quot;===
Another suggestion is an association with the root &quot;l-h-m&quot; &quot;to fight&quot;, leading to the meaning of &quot;house of war&quot; or &quot;house of fighting&quot;, but this is thought unlikely.

==History==
===Canaanite period===
The earliest reference to Bethlehem appears in the Amarna correspondence (). In one of his six letters to Pharaoh, Abdi-Heba, the Egyptian-appointed governor of Jerusalem, appeals for aid in retaking &quot;Bit-Laḫmi&quot; in the wake of disturbances by Apiru mercenaries: &quot;Now even a town near Jerusalem, Bit-Lahmi by name, a village which once belonged to the king, has fallen to the enemy... Let the king hear the words of your servant Abdi-Heba, and send archers to restore the imperial lands of the king!&quot;

It is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that it was originally a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals. &quot;Laḫmu&quot; was the Akkadian god of fertility, worshipped by the Canaanites as &quot;Leḥem&quot;. Some time in the third millennium BCE, Canaanites erected a temple on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity, probably dedicated to Laḫmu. The temple, and subsequently the town that formed around it, was then known as &quot;Beit Lahama&quot;, &quot;House (Temple) of Lahmu&quot;. By 1200 BC, the area of Bethlehem, as well as much of the region, was conquered by the Philistines, which led the region to be known to the Greeks as &quot;Philistia&quot;, later corrupted to &quot;Palestine&quot;.

A burial ground discovered in spring 2013, and surveyed in 2015 by a joint Italian–Palestinian team found that the necropolis covered 3 hectares (more than 7 acres) and originally contained more than 100 tombs in use between roughly 2200 BCE and 650 BCE. The archaeologists were able to identify at least 30 tombs.

===Israelite and Judean period===
Archaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as a city in the Kingdom of Judah was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the City of David in the form of a &quot;bulla&quot; (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads &quot;From the town of Bethlehem to the King&quot;. According to the excavators, it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.

Biblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the &quot;hill country&quot; of Judea, may be the same as the Biblical Ephrath, which means &quot;fertile&quot;, as there is a reference to it in the Book of Micah as Bethlehem Ephrathah or Bethlehem Ephratah. The Hebrew Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah, and the New Testament describes it as the &quot;City of David&quot;. It is first mentioned in the Bible as the place where the matriarch Rachel died and was buried &quot;by the wayside&quot; (). Rachel&#x27;s Tomb, the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the Book of Ruth, the valley to the east is where Ruth of Moab gleaned the fields and returned to town with Naomi. In the Books of Samuel, Bethlehem is mentioned as the home of Jesse, father of King David of Israel, and the site of David&#x27;s anointment by the prophet Samuel. It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of Adullam.

Writing in the 4th century, the Pilgrim of Bordeaux reported that the sepulchers of David, Ezekiel, Asaph, Job, Jesse, and Solomon were located near Bethlehem.

===Classical period===


The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke represent Jesus as having been born in Bethlehem, known in Aramaic by the Hebrew name (). However, modern scholars regard the two accounts as contradictory; the Gospel of Mark, the earliest gospel, mentions nothing about Jesus having been born in Bethlehem, saying only that he came from Nazareth. Current scholars are divided on the actual birthplace of Jesus: some believe he was actually born in Nazareth, while others still hold that he was born in Bethlehem.

Nonetheless, the tradition that Jesus was born in Bethlehem was prominent in the early church. Around 155, the apologist Justin Martyr recommended that those who doubted Jesus was really born in Bethlehem could go there and visit the very cave where he was supposed to have been born. The same cave is also referenced by the apocryphal Gospel of James and the fourth-century church historian Eusebius. After the Bar Kokhba revolt () was crushed, the Roman emperor Hadrian converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous.

Around 395 CE, Jerome wrote in a letter: &quot;Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is to say, Adonis, and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of Venus was lamented.&quot; Many scholars have taken this letter as evidence that the cave of the nativity over which the Church of the Nativity was later built had at one point been a shrine to the ancient Near Eastern fertility god Tammuz. Eusebius, however, mentions nothing about the cave having been associated with Tammuz and there are no other Patristic sources that suggest Tammuz had a shrine in Bethlehem. Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual over Tammuz&#x27;s death. Joan E. Taylor has countered this contention by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz.

In 326–328, the empress Helena, widowed consort of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and mother of the ruling emperor, Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage to Syria-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem. The Church of the Nativity was built at her initiative over the cave where Jesus was purported to have been born. During the Samaritan revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, supported by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.

===Middle Ages===
In 637, shortly after Jerusalem was captured by the Muslim armies, &#x27;Umar ibn al-Khattāb, the second caliph, promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use. A mosque dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church. Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the Umayyads in the 8th century, then the Abbasids in the 9th century. A Persian geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the &quot;Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round.&quot; In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure&#x27;s southern transept.

In 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the Crusaders, who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox clergy were removed from their sees and replaced with Latin clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, Baldwin I, first king of the Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.

In 1187, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria who led the Muslim Ayyubids, captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims. William IV, Count of Nevers had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of Clamecy in present-day Burgundy, France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous &#x27;in partibus infidelium&#x27; seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the French Revolution in 1789.

Bethlehem, along with Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Sidon, was briefly ceded to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem by a treaty between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and Ayyubid Sultan al-Kamil in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244. In 1250, with the coming to power of the Mamluks under Rukn al-Din Baibars, tolerance of Christianity declined. Members of the clergy left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the Armenians.

===Ottoman era===

From 1517, during the years of Ottoman control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 akce.

Bethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).

From 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha, during the Peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem&#x27;s inhabitants faced unemployment, compulsory military service, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to South America. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water limited the town&#x27;s growth.

Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bethlehem had a population of 179 Muslims in 59 houses, 979 &quot;Latins&quot; in 256 houses, 824 &quot;Greeks&quot; in 213 houses, and 41 Armenians in 11 houses, a total of 539 houses. The population count only included men. Hartmann found that Bethlehem had 520 houses.

===Modern era===

Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine from 1920 to 1948. In the United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s 1947 resolution to partition Palestine, Bethlehem was included in the international enclave of Jerusalem to be administered by the United Nations. Jordan captured the city during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Many refugees from areas captured by Israeli forces in 1947–48 fled to the Bethlehem area, primarily settling in what became the official refugee camps of &#x27;Azza (Beit Jibrin) and &#x27;Aida in the north and Dheisheh in the south. The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem&#x27;s Christian majority into a Muslim one.

Jordan retained control of the city until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the West Bank. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city.

During the early months of First Intifada, on 5 May 1989, Milad Anton Shahin, aged 12, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Replying to a Member of Knesset in August 1990 Defence Minister Yitzak Rabin stated that a group of reservists in an observation post had come under attack by stone throwers. The commander of the post, a senior non-commissioned officer, fired two plastic bullets in deviation of operational rules. No evidence was found that this caused the boy&#x27;s death. The officer was found guilty of illegal use of a weapon and sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, two of them actually in prison doing public service. He was also demoted.

On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem, and three days later the city came under the administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During the Second Palestinian Intifada in 2000–2005, Bethlehem&#x27;s infrastructure and tourism industry were damaged. In 2002, it was a primary combat zone in Operation Defensive Shield, a major military counteroffensive by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the militants to foreign countries.

Today, the city is surrounded by two bypass roads for Israeli settlers, leaving the inhabitants squeezed between thirty-seven Jewish enclaves, where a quarter of all West Bank settlers, roughly 170,000, live; the gap between the two roads is closed by the 8-metre high Israeli West Bank barrier, which cuts Bethlehem off from its sister city Jerusalem. Christian families that have lived in Bethlehem for hundreds of years are being forced to leave as land in Bethlehem is seized, and homes bulldozed, for construction of thousands of new Israeli homes. Land seizures for Israeli settlements have also prevented construction of a new hospital for the inhabitants of Bethlehem, as well as the barrier separating dozens of Palestinian families from their farmland and Christian communities from their places of worship. Christians have reportedly suffered persecution under the Palestinian Authority, leading to emigration.

==Geography==
Bethlehem is located at an elevation of about above sea level, higher than nearby Jerusalem. Bethlehem is situated on the Judean Mountains.

The city is located northeast of Gaza City and the Mediterranean Sea, west of Amman, Jordan, southeast of Tel Aviv, Israel and south of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Beit Safafa and Jerusalem to the north, Beit Jala to the northwest, Husan to the west, al-Khadr and Artas to the southwest, and Beit Sahour to the east. Beit Jala and the latter form an agglomeration with Bethlehem. The Aida and Azza refugee camps are located within the city limits.

In the center of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city consists of eight quarters, laid out in a mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh—the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu&#x27; in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma&#x27;asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.

===Climate===
Bethlehem has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;), with hot and dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Winter temperatures (mid-December to mid-March) can be cool and rainy. January is the coldest month, with temperatures ranging from 1 to 13 degree Celsius (33–55 °F). From May through September, the weather is warm and sunny. August is the hottest month, with a high of 30 degrees Celsius (86 °F). Bethlehem receives an average of of rainfall annually, 70% between November and January.

Bethlehem&#x27;s average annual relative humidity is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels are at their lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea breeze that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy and dust &quot;Khamaseen&quot; winds from the Arabian Desert, during April, May and mid-June.

==Demographics==
===Population===
According to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and Muslim populations became equal by the middle of that century. However, there were no Muslim inhabitants counted by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male taxpayers. Christians, like all non-Muslims throughout the Ottoman Empire, were required to pay the jizya tax. In 1867, an American visitor describes the town as having a population of 3,000 to 4,000, of whom about 100 were Protestant, 300 were Muslim and &quot;the remainder belonging to the Latin and Greek Churches with a few Armenians.&quot; Another report from the same year puts the Christian population at 3,000, with an additional 50 Muslims. An 1885 source put the population at approximately 6,000 of &quot;principally Christians, Latins and Greeks&quot; with no Jewish inhabitants.

The census of 1922 lists Bethlehem as having 6,658 residents (5,838 Christians, 818 Muslims, and two Jews), increasing in 1931 to 6,804 (5,588 Christians, 1,219 Muslims, five with no religion, and two Jews) with 506 in nearby suburbs (251 Muslims, 216 Christians, and 39 Jews).

The 1938 village statistics list the population as 7,520 with 499 in nearby suburbs (including 42 Jews). The 1945 village statistics list Bethlehem&#x27;s population as 8,820 (6,430 Christians, 2,370 Muslims, and 20 &quot;other&quot;).

In 1948, the religious makeup of the city was 85% Christian, mostly of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic denominations, and 13% Muslim. In the 1967 census taken by Israel authorities, the town of Bethlehem proper numbered 14,439 inhabitants, its 7,790 Muslim inhabitants represented 53.9% of the population, while the Christians of various denominations numbered 6,231 or 46.1%.

In the PCBS&#x27;s 1997 census, the city had a population of 21,670, including a total of 6,570 refugees, accounting for 30.3% of the city&#x27;s population. In 1997, the age distribution of Bethlehem&#x27;s inhabitants was 27.4% under the age of 10, 20% from 10 to 19, 17.3% from 20 to 29, 17.7% from 30 to 44, 12.1% from 45 to 64 and 5.3% above the age of 65. There were 11,079 males and 10,594 females. In the 2007 PCBS census, Bethlehem had a population of 25,266, of which 12,753 were males and 12,513 were females. There were 6,709 housing units, of which 5,211 were households. The average household consisted of 4.8 family members. By 2017, the population was 28,591.

===Christian population===

After the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s, the local Christians were Arabized even though large numbers were ethnically Arabs of the Ghassanid clans. Bethlehem&#x27;s two largest Arab Christian clans trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids, including al-Farahiyyah and an-Najajreh. The former have descended from the Ghassanids who migrated from Yemen and from the Wadi Musa area in present-day Jordan and an-Najajreh descend from Najran. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anatreh, also trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids.

The percentage of Christians in the town has been in a steady decline since the mid-twentieth century. In 1947, Christians made up 85% of the population, but by 1998, the figure had declined to 40%. In 2005, the mayor of Bethlehem, Victor Batarseh, explained that &quot;due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority.&quot; The Palestinian Authority is officially committed to equality for Christians, although there have been incidents of violence against them by the Preventive Security Service and militant factions.

In 2006, a Zogby poll that interviewed more than 1,000 Palestinian Christians from Bethlehem found that 79% of the respondents cited the Israeli occupation as source of difficulties leading the emigration of their community. In the same year, the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue conducted a poll among the city&#x27;s Christians according to which 90% said they had had Muslim friends, 73.3% agreed that the PNA treated Christian heritage in the city with respect and 78% attributed the exodus of Christians to the Israeli blockade. The only mosque in the Old City is the Mosque of Omar, located in the Manger Square. By 2016, the Christian population of Bethlehem had declined to only 16%. The Christian population&#x27;s proportion of Bethlehem fell from 87% in the 1950s to 12% in 2016.

A study by Pew Research Center concluded that the decline in the Arab Christian population of the area was partially a result of a lower birth rate among Christians than among Muslims, but also partially due to the fact that Christians were more likely to emigrate from the region than any other religious group. The seizure of Christian land by Muslim mafias and the bias of the Palestinian Judicial system have been cited as reasons leading to emigration. Amon Ramnon, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, stated that the reason why more Christians were emigrating than Muslims is because it is easier for Arab Christians to integrate into western communities than for Arab Muslims, since many of them attend church-affiliated schools, where they are taught European languages. A higher percentage of Christians in the region are urban-dwellers, which also makes it easier for them to emigrate and assimilate into western populations. A statistical analysis of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians&#x27; middle-class status and higher education. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city. However, it is likely that there are many other factors, most of which are shared with the Palestinian population as a whole.

==Economy==
Shopping is a major attraction, especially during the Christmas season. The city&#x27;s main streets and old markets are lined with shops selling Palestinian handicrafts, Middle Eastern spices, jewelry and oriental sweets such as baklawa. Olive wood carvings are the item most purchased by tourists visiting Bethlehem. Religious handicrafts include ornaments handmade from mother-of-pearl, as well as olive wood statues, boxes, and crosses. Other industries include stone and marble-cutting, textiles, furniture and furnishings. Bethlehem factories also produce paints, plastics, synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and food products, mainly pasta and confectionery.
Cremisan Wine, founded in 1885, is a winery run by monks in the Monastery of Cremisan. The grapes are grown mainly in the al-Khader district. In 2007, the monastery&#x27;s wine production was around 700,000 liters per year.

In 2008, Bethlehem hosted the largest economic conference to date in the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince more than a thousand businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories. Tourism is Bethlehem&#x27;s main industry. Unlike other Palestinian localities prior to 2000, the majority of the employed residents did not have jobs in Israel. More than 20% of the working population is employed in the industry. Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city&#x27;s economy and 11% of the Palestinian National Authority. The city has more than two million visitors every year. Tourism in Bethlehem ground to a halt for over a decade after the Second Intifada, but gradually began to pick back up in the early 2010s. Schneider Electric operates a facility in the Multidisciplinary Industrial Park of Bethlehem, which was developed by the Palestinian government and France.

The Church of the Nativity is one of Bethlehem&#x27;s major tourist attractions and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands in the center of the city — a part of the Manger Square — over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where St. Jerome spent thirty years creating the Vulgate, the dominant Latin version of the Bible until the Reformation. There are over thirty hotels in Bethlehem. Jacir Palace, built in 1910 near the church, is one of Bethlehem&#x27;s most successful hotels and its oldest. It was closed down in 2000 due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but reopened in 2005 as the Jacir Palace InterContinental at Bethlehem. The hotel is managed by world renowned international brand — the Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG) and is second IHG hotel in the country after IHG in Jerusalem.

==Religious significance and commemoration==

===Birthplace of Jesus===


In the New Testament, the Gospel of Luke says that Jesus&#x27; parents traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew mentions Bethlehem as the place of birth, and adds that King Herod was told that a &#x27;King of the Jews&#x27; had been born in the town, prompting Herod to order the killing of all the boys who were two years old or under in the town and surrounding area. Joseph, warned of Herod&#x27;s impending action by an angel of the Lord, decided to flee to Egypt with his family and then later settled in Nazareth after Herod&#x27;s death.

Early Christian traditions describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem: in one account, a verse in the Book of Micah is interpreted as a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. The second century Christian apologist Justin Martyr stated in his &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot; (written c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town and then placed Jesus in a manger. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in &quot;Archaeology&quot; magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. However, other archaeologists argue that there is evidence that Bethlehem of Judea was inhabited at that time. In a 2011 article in &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot; magazine, Jerome Murphy-O&#x27;Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.

===Christmas celebrations===
Christmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations, but Greek, Coptic and Syrian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and Armenian Orthodox Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the Basilica of the Nativity. Roman Catholic services take place in St. Catherine&#x27;s Church and Protestants often hold services at Shepherds&#x27; Fields.

===Other religious festivals===
Bethlehem celebrates festivals related to saints and prophets associated with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual Feast of Saint George (al-Khadr) on May 5–6. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of al-Khader to baptize newborns in the waters around the Monastery of St. George and sacrifice a sheep in ritual. The Feast of St. Elijah is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north of Bethlehem.

==Culture==
===Embroidery===

The women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear. Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its &quot;strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance.&quot; Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (&quot;bisht&quot;) from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short &quot;taqsireh&quot; jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of velvet or broadcloth, usually with heavy embroidery.

Bethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for &quot;royal&quot; wedding dresses (&quot;thob malak&quot;), taqsirehs and the &quot;shatwehs&quot; worn by married women. It has been traced by some to Byzantium, and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.

===Mother-of-pearl carving===

The art of mother-of-pearl carving is said to have been a Bethlehem tradition since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars from Italy. A constant stream of pilgrims generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.

===Cultural centers and museums===
Bethlehem is home to the Palestinian Heritage Center, established in 1991. The center aims to preserve and promote Palestinian embroidery, art and folklore. The International Center of Bethlehem is another cultural center that concentrates primarily on the culture of Bethlehem. It provides language and guide training, woman&#x27;s studies and arts and crafts displays, and training.

The Bethlehem branch of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music has about 500 students. Its primary goals are to teach children music, train teachers for other schools, sponsor music research, and the study of Palestinian folklore music.

Bethlehem has several museums: The Crib of the Nativity Theatre and Museum offers visitors 31 three-dimensional models depicting the significant stages of the life of Jesus. Its theater presents a 20-minute animated show. The Badd Giacaman Museum, located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of olive oil production. Baituna al-Talhami Museum, established in 1972, contains displays of Bethlehem culture. The International Museum of Nativity was built by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to exhibit &quot;high artistic quality in an evocative atmosphere&quot;. The Palestine Museum of Natural History is the first of its kind and is based on Bethlehem University campus.

==Local government==
Bethlehem is the &quot;muhfaza&quot; (seat) or district capital of the Bethlehem Governorate.

Bethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the &quot;mukhtars&quot; (&quot;heads&quot;) of the quarters of Bethlehem&#x27;s Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A Basic Law was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.

Throughout, Bethlehem&#x27;s rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta&#x27;amrah Bedouins and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.

There are several branches of political parties on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People&#x27;s Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.

===Mayors===

In the October 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Vera Baboun won, becoming the first female mayor of Bethlehem.
==Education==
According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem&#x27;s population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city&#x27;s population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in primary school, 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas. There were 135 schools in the Bethlehem Governorate in 2006; 100 run the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, seven by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 28 were private.

Bethlehem is home to Bethlehem University, a Catholic Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.

==Transportation==
Bethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, Hebron, Nahalin, Battir, al-Khader, al-Ubeidiya and Beit Fajjar. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, Tuqu&#x27; and Herodium. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and &#x27;Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.

The Israeli construction of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town&#x27;s built-up area, within distance of houses in the Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem&#x27;s Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel&#x27;s Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon&#x27;s Pools.

<text>Benjamin ( &quot;Bīnyāmīn&quot;; &quot;Son of (the) right&quot;) was the younger of the two sons of Jacob and Rachel, and Jacob&#x27;s twelfth and youngest son overall. In Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition. He was also the progenitor of the Israelite Tribe of Benjamin. Unlike Rachel&#x27;s first son, Joseph, Benjamin was born in Canaan according to biblical narrative.

In the Samaritan Pentateuch, Benjamin&#x27;s name appears as &quot;&quot; (Samaritan Hebrew: , &quot;son of days&quot;). In the Quran, Benjamin is referred to as a righteous young child, who remained with Jacob when the older brothers plotted against Joseph. Later rabbinic traditions name him as one of four ancient Israelites who died without sin, the other three being Chileab, Jesse and Amram.

==Name==
The name is first mentioned in letters from King Sîn-kāšid of Uruk (1801–1771 BC), who called himself “King of Amnanum” and was a member of the Amorite tribal group the “Binu-Jamina” (single name “Binjamin”; Akkadian ). The name means &quot;Sons/Son of the South&quot; and is linguistically related as a forerunner to the Old Testament name &quot;Benjamin&quot;.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Benjamin&#x27;s name arose when Jacob deliberately changed the name &quot;Benoni&quot;, the original name of Benjamin, since Benoni was an allusion to Rachel&#x27;s dying just after she had given birth, as it means &quot;son of my pain&quot;. Textual scholars regard these two names as fragments of naming narratives coming from different sources - one being the Jahwist and the other being the Elohist.

Unusual for one of the 12 tribes of Israel, the Bible does not explain the etymology of Benjamin&#x27;s name. Medieval commentator Rashi gives two different explanations, based on Midrashic sources. &quot;Son of the south&quot;, with south derived from the word for the right hand side, referring to the birth of Benjamin in Canaan, as compared with the birth of all the other sons of Jacob in Aram. Modern scholars have proposed that &quot;son of the south&quot; / &quot;right&quot; is a reference to the tribe being subordinate to the more dominant tribe of Ephraim. Alternatively, Rashi suggests it means &quot;son of days&quot;, meaning a son born in Jacob&#x27;s old age. The Samaritan Pentateuch consistently spells his name &quot;בנימים&quot;, with a terminal mem, (&quot;Binyamim&quot;), which could be translated literally as &quot;spirit man&quot; but is in line with the interpretation that the name was a reference to the advanced age of Jacob when Benjamin was born.

According to classical rabbinical sources, Benjamin was only born after Rachel had fasted for a long time, as a religious devotion with the hope of a new child as a reward. By then Jacob had become over 100 years old. Benjamin is treated as a young child in most of the Biblical narrative, but at one point is abruptly described as the father of ten sons. Textual scholars believe that this is the result of the genealogical passage, in which his children are named, being from a much later source than the Jahwist and Elohist narratives, which make up most of the Joseph narrative, and which consistently describe Benjamin as a child.

By allusion to the biblical Benjamin, in French, Polish and Spanish, &quot;Benjamin&quot; (/ /, respectively) is a common noun meaning the youngest child of a family, especially a particularly favoured one (with a similar connotation to &quot;baby of the family&quot;).

==Israelites in Egypt==
The Torah&#x27;s Joseph narrative, at a stage when Joseph is unrecognised by his brothers, describes Joseph as testing whether his brothers have reformed by secretly planting a silver cup in Benjamin&#x27;s bag. Then, publicly searching the bags for it, and after &quot;finding&quot; it in Benjamin&#x27;s possession, demanding that Benjamin become his slave as a punishment.

The narrative goes on to state that when Judah (on behalf of the other brothers) begged Joseph not to enslave Benjamin and instead enslave him, since enslavement of Benjamin would break Jacob&#x27;s heart. This caused Joseph to recant and reveal his identity. The midrashic book of Jasher argues that prior to revealing his identity, Joseph asked Benjamin to find his missing brother (i.e. Joseph) via astrology, using an astrolabe-like tool. It continues by stating that Benjamin divined that the &quot;man on the throne&quot; was Joseph, so Joseph identified himself to Benjamin (but not the other brothers), and revealed his scheme (as in the Torah) to test how fraternal the other brothers were.

Some classical rabbinical sources argue that Joseph identified himself for other reasons. In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on the memory of Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph was so important to him that he had named his sons in Joseph&#x27;s honour. These sources go on to state that Benjamin&#x27;s oath touched Joseph so deeply that Joseph was no longer able to pretend to be a stranger.

In the narrative, just prior to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his brothers (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them; the narrative heavily implies that Benjamin was Joseph&#x27;s favorite brother, since he is overcome with tears when he first meets Benjamin in particular, and he gives Benjamin five times as much food as he apportions to the others. According to textual scholars, this is really the Jahwist&#x27;s account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist&#x27;s version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph&#x27;s emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.

== Jacob&#x27;s blessing ==
Upon his death, the patriarch Jacob blesses his youngest son: &quot;Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; In the morning he consumes the foe, And in the evening he divides the spoil&quot; (Genesis 49:27). This wolf symbolism has been interpreted to refer to several elements of the Tribe of Benjamin, including its heroic members like King Saul and Mordecai, the tribe&#x27;s often warlike nature, and the tribe&#x27;s jurisdiction over the Temple in Jerusalem in which sacrifices were &#x27;devoured&#x27; by flame.

==Origin==
Biblical scholars believe, due to their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that Ephraim and Manasseh were originally considered one tribe, that of &quot;Joseph&quot;. According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was also originally part of this single tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost.

The description of Benjamin being born after the arrival in Canaan is thought by some scholars to refer to the tribe of Benjamin coming into existence by branching from the Joseph group after the tribe had settled in Canaan. A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the &quot;Joseph tribes&quot; (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to Egypt and returned, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in Canaan throughout.

According to this view, the story of Jacob&#x27;s visit to Laban to obtain a wife originated as a metaphor for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt. According to textual scholars, the Jahwist version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal matriarchs whatsoever.

==Benjamin&#x27;s sons==
According to Genesis 46:21, Benjamin had ten sons: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. The name of his wife/wives are not given, but the Book of Jubilees calls his wife Ijasaka and the Book of Jasher mentions two wives, Mechalia the daughter of Aram and Aribath the daughter of Shomron. The classical rabbinical tradition adds that each son&#x27;s name honors Joseph: 
*&quot;Belah&quot; (meaning &quot;swallow&quot;), in reference to Joseph disappearing (&quot;being swallowed up&quot;)
*&quot;Becher&quot; (meaning &quot;first born&quot;), in reference to Joseph being the first child of Rachel
*&quot;Ashbel&quot; (meaning &quot;capture&quot;), in reference to Joseph having suffered captivity
*&quot;Gera&quot; (meaning &quot;grain&quot;), in reference to Joseph living in a &quot;foreign&quot; land (Egypt)
*&quot;Naaman&quot; (meaning &quot;grace&quot;), in reference to Joseph having graceful speech
*&quot;Ehi&quot; (meaning &quot;my brother&quot;), in reference to Joseph being Benjamin&#x27;s only full-brother (as opposed to half-brothers)
*&quot;Rosh&quot; (meaning &quot;elder&quot;), in reference to Joseph being older than Benjamin
*&quot;Muppim&quot; (meaning &quot;double mouth&quot;), in reference to Joseph passing on what he had been taught by Jacob
*&quot;Huppim&quot; (meaning &quot;marriage canopies&quot;), in reference to Joseph being married in Egypt, while Benjamin was not there
*&quot;Ard&quot; (meaning &quot;wanderer&quot;/&quot;fugitive&quot;), in reference to Joseph being like a rose
There is a disparity between the list given in Genesis 46 and that in Numbers 26, where the sons of Benjamin are listed along with the tribes they are the progenitors of.
*&quot;Belah&quot;, progenitor of the Belaites, is in both lists
*&quot;Ashbel&quot;, progenitor of the Ashbelites, is in both lists
*&quot;Ahiram&quot;, progenitor of the Ahiramites, appears in this list but not the first
*&quot;Shupham&quot;, progenitor of the Shuphamites, corresponds to Muppim from the first list
*&quot;Hupham&quot;, progenitor of the Huphamites, corresponds to Huppim from the first list
Becher, Gera, Ehi, and Rosh are omitted from the second list. Ard and Naaman, who are the sons of Benjamin according to Numbers 26, are listed as the sons of Belah and are the progenitors of the Ardites and the Naamites respectively.

==In Islam==
Though not named in the Quran, Benjamin ( Binyāmīn) is referred to as the righteous youngest son of Jacob, in the narrative of Joseph in Islamic tradition. Apart from that, however, Islamic tradition does not provide much detail regarding Benjamin&#x27;s life, and refers to him as being born from Jacob&#x27;s wife Rachel. As with Jewish tradition, it also further links a connection between the names of Benjamin&#x27;s children and Joseph.
