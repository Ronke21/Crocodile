<text>Abbas Kiarostami ( ; 22 June 1940 – 4 July 2016) was an Iranian film director, screenwriter, poet, photographer, and film producer. An active filmmaker from 1970, Kiarostami had been involved in the production of over forty films, including shorts and documentaries. Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the Koker trilogy (1987–1994), &quot;Close-Up&quot; (1990), &quot;The Wind Will Carry Us&quot; (1999), and &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; (1997), which was awarded the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year. In later works, &quot;Certified Copy&quot; (2010) and &quot;Like Someone in Love&quot; (2012), he filmed for the first time outside Iran: in Italy and Japan, respectively. His films &quot;Where Is the Friend&#x27;s Home?&quot; (1987), &quot;Close-Up&quot;, and &quot;The Wind Will Carry Us&quot; were ranked among the 100 best foreign films in a 2018 critics&#x27; poll by BBC Culture. &quot;Close-Up&quot; was also ranked one of the 50 greatest movies of all time in the famous decennial &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll conducted in 2012.

Kiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter, film editor, art director, and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material. He was also a poet, photographer, painter, illustrator, and graphic designer. He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the Iranian New Wave, a Persian cinema movement that started in the late 1960s and emphasized the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues.

Kiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists, for documentary-style narrative films, for stories that take place in rural villages, and for conversations that unfold inside cars, using stationary mounted cameras. He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami&#x27;s films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami&#x27;s works.

==Early life and background==

Kiarostami was born in Tehran. His first artistic experience was painting, which he continued into his late teens, winning a painting competition at the age of 18 shortly before he left home to study at the University of Tehran School of Fine Arts. He majored in painting and graphic design and supported his studies by working as a traffic policeman.

As a painter, designer, and illustrator, Kiarostami worked in advertising in the 1960s, designing posters and creating commercials. Between 1962 and 1966, he shot around 150 advertisements for Iranian television. In the late 1960s, he began creating credit titles for films (including &quot;Gheysar&quot; by Masoud Kimiai) and illustrating children&#x27;s books.

==Film career==
===1970s===
In 1970 when the Iranian New Wave began with Dariush Mehrjui&#x27;s film &quot;Gāv&quot;, Kiarostami helped set up a filmmaking department at the Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (Kanun) in Tehran. Its debut production, and Kiarostami&#x27;s first film, was the twelve-minute &quot;The Bread and Alley&quot; (1970), a neo-realistic short film about a schoolboy&#x27;s confrontation with an aggressive dog. &quot;Breaktime&quot; followed in 1972. The department became one of Iran&#x27;s most noted film studios, producing not only Kiarostami&#x27;s films but acclaimed Persian films such as &quot;The Runner&quot; and &quot;Bashu, the Little Stranger&quot;.

In the 1970s, Kiarostami pursued an individualistic style of film making. When discussing his first film, he stated:
&quot;Bread and Alley&quot; was my first experience in cinema and I must say a very difficult one. I had to work with a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.
Following &quot;The Experience&quot; (1973), Kiarostami released &quot;The Traveler&quot; (&quot;Mossafer&quot;) in 1974. &quot;The Traveler&quot; tells the story of Qassem Julayi, a troubled and troublesome boy from a small Iranian city. Intent on attending a football match in far-off Tehran, he scams his friends and neighbors to raise money, and journeys to the stadium in time for the game, only to meet with an ironic twist of fate. In addressing the boy&#x27;s determination to reach his goal, alongside his indifference to the effects of his amoral actions, the film examined human behavior and the balance of right and wrong. It furthered Kiarostami&#x27;s reputation for realism, diegetic simplicity, and stylistic complexity, as well as his fascination with physical and spiritual journeys.

In 1975, Kiarostami directed two short films &quot;So Can I&quot; and &quot;Two Solutions for One Problem&quot;. In early 1976, he released &quot;Colors&quot;, followed by the fifty-four-minute film &quot;A Wedding Suit&quot;, a story about three teenagers coming into conflict over a suit for a wedding.
Kiarostami then directed &quot;Report&quot; (1977). With a 112-minute runtime, it was considerably longer than his previous work. The film revolved around the life of a tax collector accused of accepting bribes; suicide was among its themes. In 1979, he produced and directed &quot;First Case, Second Case&quot;.

===1980s===
In the early 1980s, Kiarostami directed several short films including &quot;Toothache&quot; (1980), &quot;Orderly or Disorderly&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Chorus&quot; (1982). In 1983, he directed &quot;Fellow Citizen.&quot; It was not until his release of &quot;Where Is the Friend&#x27;s Home?&quot; (1987) that he began to gain recognition outside Iran. These films created the basis of his later productions.

The film tells a simple account of a conscientious eight-year-old schoolboy&#x27;s quest to return his friend&#x27;s notebook in a neighboring village lest his friend be expelled from school. The traditional beliefs of Iranian rural people are portrayed. The film has been noted for its poetic use of the Iranian rural landscape and its realism, both important elements of Kiarostami&#x27;s work. Kiarostami made the film from a child&#x27;s point of view.

&quot;Where Is the Friend&#x27;s Home?&quot;, &quot;And Life Goes On&quot; (1992) (also known as &quot;Life and Nothing More&quot;), and &quot;Through the Olive Trees&quot; (1994) are described by critics as the &quot;Koker trilogy&quot;, because all three films feature the village of Koker in northern Iran. The films also relate to the 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake, in which 40,000 people died. Kiarostami uses the themes of life, death, change, and continuity to connect the films. The trilogy was successful in France in the 1990s and other Western European countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Finland. But, Kiarostami did not consider the three films to comprise a trilogy. He suggested that the last two titles plus &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; (1997) comprise a trilogy, given their common theme of the preciousness of life. In 1987, Kiarostami was involved in the screenwriting of &quot;The Key&quot;, which he edited but did not direct. In 1989, he released &quot;Homework&quot;.

===1990s===

Kiarostami&#x27;s first film of the decade was &quot;Close-Up&quot; (1990), which narrates the story of the real-life trial of a man who impersonated film-maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, conning a family into believing they would star in his new film. The family suspects theft as the motive for this charade, but the impersonator, Hossein Sabzian, argues that his motives were more complex. The part-documentary, part-staged film examines Sabzian&#x27;s moral justification for usurping Makhmalbaf&#x27;s identity, questioning his ability to sense his cultural and artistic flair. Ranked No. 42 in British Film Institute&#x27;s The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time, &quot;Close-Up&quot; received praise from directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Werner Herzog, Jean-Luc Godard, and Nanni Moretti and was released across Europe.

In 1992, Kiarostami directed &quot;Life, and Nothing More...&quot;, regarded by critics as the second film of the &quot;Koker trilogy&quot;. The film follows a father and his young son as they drive from Tehran to Koker in search of two young boys who they fear might have perished in the 1990 earthquake. As the father and son travel through the devastated landscape, they meet earthquake survivors forced to carry on with their lives amid disaster.
That year Kiarostami won a Prix Roberto Rossellini, the first professional film award of his career, for his direction of the film. The last film of the so-called &quot;Koker trilogy&quot; was &quot;Through the Olive Trees&quot; (1994), which expands a peripheral scene from &quot;Life and Nothing More&quot; into the central drama.
Critics such as Adrian Martin have called the style of filmmaking in the &quot;Koker trilogy&quot; as &quot;diagrammatical&quot;, linking the zig-zagging patterns in the landscape and the geometry of forces of life and the world. A flashback of the zigzag path in &quot;Life and Nothing More...&quot; (1992) in turn triggers the spectator&#x27;s memory of the previous film, &quot;Where Is the Friend&#x27;s Home?&quot; from 1987, shot before the earthquake. This symbolically links to the post-earthquake reconstruction in &quot;Through the Olive Trees&quot; in 1994. In 1995, Miramax Films released &quot;Through the Olive Trees&quot; in the US theaters.

Kiarostami next wrote the screenplays for &quot;The Journey&quot; and &quot;The White Balloon&quot; (1995), for his former assistant Jafar Panahi. Between 1995 and 1996, he was involved in the production of &quot;Lumière and Company&quot;, a collaboration with 40 other film directors.

Kiarostami won the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; (Golden Palm) award at the Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Taste of Cherry.&quot; It is the drama of a man, Mr. Badii, determined to commit suicide. The film involved themes such as morality, the legitimacy of the act of suicide, and the meaning of compassion.

Kiarostami directed &quot;The Wind Will Carry Us&quot; in 1999, which won the Grand Jury Prize (Silver Lion) at the Venice International Film Festival. The film contrasted rural and urban views on the dignity of labor, addressing themes of gender equality and the benefits of progress, by means of a stranger&#x27;s sojourn in a remote Kurdish village. An unusual feature of the movie is that many of the characters are heard but not seen; at least thirteen to fourteen speaking characters in the film are never seen.

===2000s===
In 2000, at the San Francisco Film Festival award ceremony, Kiarostami was awarded the Akira Kurosawa Prize for lifetime achievement in directing, but surprised everyone by giving it away to veteran Iranian actor Behrooz Vossoughi for his contribution to Iranian cinema.

In 2001, Kiarostami and his assistant, Seifollah Samadian, traveled to Kampala, Uganda at the request of the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development, to film a documentary about programs assisting Ugandan orphans. He stayed for ten days and made &quot;ABC Africa&quot;. The trip was originally intended as research in preparation for the filming, but Kiarostami ended up editing the entire film from the video footage shot there. The high number of orphans in Uganda has resulted from the deaths of parents in the AIDS epidemic.

&quot;Time Out&quot; editor and National Film Theatre chief programmer, Geoff Andrew, said in referring to the film: &quot;Like his previous four features, this film is not about death but life-and-death: how they&#x27;re linked, and what attitude we might adopt with regard to their symbiotic inevitability.&quot;

The following year, Kiarostami directed &quot;Ten&quot;, revealing an unusual method of filmmaking and abandoning many scriptwriting conventions. Kiarostami focused on the socio-political landscape of Iran. The images are seen through the eyes of one woman as she drives through the streets of Tehran over a period of several days. Her journey is composed of ten conversations with various passengers, which include her sister, a hitchhiking prostitute, and a jilted bride and her demanding young son. This style of filmmaking was praised by a number of critics.

A. O. Scott in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Kiarostami, &quot;in addition to being perhaps the most internationally admired Iranian filmmaker of the past decade, is also among the world masters of automotive cinema...He understands the automobile as a place of reflection, observation and, above all, talk.&quot;

In 2003, Kiarostami directed &quot;Five&quot;, a poetic feature with no dialogue or characterization. It consists of five long shots of nature which are single-take sequences, shot with a hand-held DV camera, along the shores of the Caspian Sea. Although the film lacks a clear storyline, Geoff Andrew argues that the film is &quot;more than just pretty pictures&quot;. He adds, &quot;Assembled in order, they comprise a kind of abstract or emotional narrative arc, which moves evocatively from separation and solitude to community, from motion to rest, near-silence to sound and song, light to darkness and back to light again, ending on a note of rebirth and regeneration.&quot;He notes the degree of artifice concealed behind the apparent simplicity of the imagery.

In 2005, Kiarostami contributed the central section to &quot;Tickets&quot;, a portmanteau film set on a train traveling through Italy. The other segments were directed by Ken Loach and Ermanno Olmi.

In 2008, Kiarostami directed the feature &quot;Shirin,&quot; which features close-ups of many notable Iranian actresses and the French actress Juliette Binoche as they watch a film based on a partly mythological Persian romance tale of Khosrow and Shirin, with themes of female self-sacrifice. The film has been described as &quot;a compelling exploration of the relationship between image, sound and female spectatorship.&quot;

That summer, he directed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; conducted by Christophe Rousset at Festival d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence starring with William Shimell. But the following year&#x27;s performances at the English National Opera was impossible to direct because of refusal of permission to travel abroad.

===2010s===
&quot;Certified Copy&quot; (2010), again starring Juliette Binoche, was made in Tuscany and was Kiarostami&#x27;s first film to be shot and produced outside Iran. The story of an encounter between a British man and a French woman, it was entered in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or in the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes the film as an &quot;intriguing oddity&quot;, and said, &quot;&quot;Certified Copy&quot; is the deconstructed portrait of a marriage, acted with well-intentioned fervour by Juliette Binoche, but persistently baffling, contrived, and often simply bizarre – a highbrow misfire of the most peculiar sort.&quot; He concluded that the film is &quot;unmistakably an example of Kiarostami&#x27;s compositional technique, though not a successful example.&quot; Roger Ebert, however, praised the film, noting that &quot;Kiarostami is rather brilliant in the way he creates offscreen spaces.&quot; Binoche won the Best Actress Award at Cannes for her performance in the film. Kiarostami&#x27;s penultimate film, &quot;Like Someone in Love&quot;, set and shot in Japan, received largely positive reviews from critics.

Kiarostami&#x27;s final film &quot;24 Frames&quot; was released posthumously in 2017. An experimental film based on 24 of Kiarostami&#x27;s still photographs, &quot;24 Frames&quot; enjoyed a highly positive critical reception, with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 92%.

===Film festival work===
Kiarostami was a jury member at numerous film festivals, most notably the Cannes Film Festival in 1993, 2002 and 2005. He was also the president of the Caméra d&#x27;Or Jury in Cannes Film Festival 2005. He was announced as the president of the Cinéfondation and short film sections of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.

Other representatives include the Venice Film Festival in 1985, the Locarno International Film Festival in 1990, the San Sebastian International Film Festival in 1996, the São Paulo International Film Festival in 2004, the Capalbio Cinema Festival in 2007 (in which he was president of the jury), and the Küstendorf Film and Music Festival in 2011. He also made regular appearances at many other film festivals across Europe, including the Estoril Film Festival in Portugal.

==Cinematic style==
===Individualism===
Though Kiarostami has been compared to Satyajit Ray, Vittorio De Sica, Éric Rohmer, and Jacques Tati, his films exhibit a singular style, often employing techniques of his own invention.

During the filming of &quot;The Bread and Alley&quot; in 1970, Kiarostami had major differences with his experienced cinematographer about how to film the boy and the attacking dog. While the cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching, a close-up of his hand as he enters the house and closes the door, followed by a shot of the dog, Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact in creating tension over the situation. That one shot took around forty days to complete until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the rhythm and content of the film&#x27;s structure, preferring to let the scene flow as one.

Unlike other directors, Kiarostami showed no interest in staging extravagant combat scenes or complicated chase scenes in large-scale productions, instead attempting to mold the medium of film to his own specifications. Kiarostami appeared to have settled on his style with the &quot;Koker trilogy&quot;, which included a myriad of references to his own film material, connecting common themes and subject matter between each of the films. Stephen Bransford has contended that Kiarostami&#x27;s films do not contain references to the work of other directors, but are fashioned in such a manner that they are self-referenced. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic with one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film.

He continued experimenting with new modes of filming, using different directorial methods and techniques. A case in point is &quot;Ten&quot;, which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present. He gave suggestions to the actors about what to do, and a camera placed on the dashboard filmed them while they drove around Tehran. The camera was allowed to roll, capturing the faces of the people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. &quot;Ten&quot; was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. This new direction towards a &quot;digital micro-cinema&quot; is defined as a micro-budget filmmaking practice, allied with a digital production basis.

Kiarostami&#x27;s cinema offers a different definition of &quot;film&quot;. According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami of William Paterson University, Kiarostami consistently tried to redefine film by forcing the increased involvement of the audience. In his later years, he also progressively trimmed the timespan within his films. Akrami thinks that this reduces filmmaking from a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression.

===Fiction and non-fiction===

Kiarostami&#x27;s films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements (docufiction). Kiarostami has stated, &quot;We can never get close to the truth except through lying.&quot;

The boundary between fiction and non-fiction is significantly reduced in Kiarostami&#x27;s cinema. The French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, writing about Kiarostami, and in particular &quot;Life and Nothing More...&quot;, has argued that his films are neither quite fiction nor quite documentary. &quot;Life and Nothing More...&quot;, he argues, is neither representation nor reportage, but rather &quot;evidence&quot;:
[I]t all looks like reporting, but everything underscores (&quot;indique à l&#x27;évidence&quot;) that it is the fiction of a documentary (in fact, Kiarostami shot the film several months after the earthquake), and that it is rather a document about &quot;fiction&quot;: not in the sense of imagining the unreal, but in the very specific and precise sense of the technique, of the &quot;art&quot; of constructing images. For the image by means of which, each time, each opens a world and precedes himself in it (&quot;s&#x27;y précède&quot;) is not pregiven (&quot;donnée toute faite&quot;) (as are those of dreams, phantasms or bad films): it is to be invented, cut and edited. Thus it is &quot;evidence&quot;, insofar as, if one day I happen to &quot;look&quot; at my street on which I walk up and down ten times a day, I construct for an instant a new &quot;evidence&quot; of my street.

For Jean-Luc Nancy, this notion of cinema as &quot;evidence&quot;, rather than as documentary or imagination, is tied to the way Kiarostami deals with life-and-death (cf. the remark by Geoff Andrew on &quot;ABC Africa&quot;, cited above, to the effect that Kiarostami&#x27;s films are not about death but about life-and-death):
 Existence resists the indifference of life-and-death, it lives beyond mechanical &quot;life&quot;, it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought—which, for me, is the very thought of this film [&quot;Life and Nothing More...&quot;]—is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It&#x27;s a slow thought, always underway, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images so that images become this thought, so that they become the evidence of this thought—and not to &quot;represent&quot; it.

In other words, wanting to accomplish more than just represent life and death as opposing forces, but rather to illustrate the way in which each element of nature is inextricably linked, Kiarostami devised a cinema that does more than just present the viewer with the documentable &quot;facts&quot;, but neither is it simply a matter of artifice. Because &quot;existence&quot; means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly fictive element, but in this &quot;being more than&quot; life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving a clue, in other words, toward the interpretation of Kiarostami&#x27;s statement that lying is the only way to truth.

===Themes of life and death===

The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami&#x27;s works. In the &quot;Koker trilogy&quot;, these themes play a central role. As illustrated in the aftermath of the 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake disaster, they also represent the power of human resilience to overcome and defy destruction.

Unlike the Koker films, which convey an instinctual thirst for survival, &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; explores the fragility of life and focuses on how precious it is.

Some film critics believe that the assemblage of light versus dark scenes in Kiarostami&#x27;s film grammar, such as in &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; and &quot;The Wind Will Carry Us&quot;, suggests the mutual existence of life with its endless possibilities, and death as a factual moment of anyone&#x27;s life.

===Poetry and imagery===
Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak, of the University of Maryland, argues that one aspect of Kiarostami&#x27;s cinematic style is that he is able to capture the essence of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In several of his movies such as &quot;Where is the Friend&#x27;s Home&quot; and &quot;The Wind Will Carry Us&quot;, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.
The characters recite poems mainly from classical Persian poet Omar Khayyám or modern Persian poets such as Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad. One scene in &quot;The Wind Will Carry Us&quot; has a long shot of a wheat field with rippling golden crops through which the doctor, accompanied by the filmmaker, is riding his scooter in a twisting road. In response to the comment that the other world is a better place than this one, the doctor recites this poem of Khayyam:

&lt;poem&gt;They promise of houries in heaven
But I would say wine is better
Take the present to the promises
A drum sounds melodious from distance&lt;/poem&gt;

It has been argued that the creative merit of Kiarostami&#x27;s adaptation of Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad&#x27;s poems extends the domain of textual transformation. Adaptation is defined as the transformation of a prior to a new text. Sima Daad of the University of Washington contends that Kiarostami&#x27;s adaptation arrives at the theoretical realm of adaptation by expanding its limit from inter-textual potential to trans-generic potential.

===Spirituality===
Kiarostami&#x27;s &quot;complex&quot; sound-images and philosophical approach have caused frequent comparisons with &quot;mystical&quot; filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Robert Bresson. While acknowledging substantial cultural differences, much of Western critical writing about Kiarostami positions him as the Iranian equivalent of such directors, by virtue of a similarly austere, &quot;spiritual&quot; poetics and moral commitment. Some draw parallels between certain imagery in Kiarostami&#x27;s films with that of Sufi concepts.

While most English-language writers, such as David Sterritt and the Spanish film professor Alberto Elena, interpret Kiarostami&#x27;s films as spiritual, other critics, including David Walsh and Hamish Ford, have rated the influence of spirituality in his films as lower. 

==Poetry, art and photography==

Kiarostami, along with Jean Cocteau, Satyajit Ray, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Derek Jarman, and Alejandro Jodorowsky, was a filmmaker who expressed himself in other genres, such as poetry, set designs, painting, or photography. They expressed their interpretation of the world and their understanding of our preoccupations and identities.

Kiarostami was a noted photographer and poet. A bilingual collection of more than 200 of his poems, &quot;Walking with the Wind&quot;, was published by Harvard University Press. His photographic work includes &quot;Untitled Photographs&quot;, a collection of over thirty photographs, mostly of snow landscapes, taken in his hometown Tehran, between 1978 and 2003. In 1999, he also published a collection of his poems. Kiarostami also produced Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, which premiered in Aix-en-Provence in 2003 before being performed at the English National Opera in London in 2004.

Riccardo Zipoli, from the Ca&#x27; Foscari University of Venice, has studied the relations and interconnections between Kiarostami&#x27;s poems and his films. The results of the analysis reveal how Kiarostami&#x27;s treatment of &quot;uncertain reality&quot; is similar in his poems and films.

Kiarostami&#x27;s poetry is reminiscent of the later nature poems of the Persian painter-poet Sohrab Sepehri. On the other hand, the succinct allusion to philosophical truths without the need for deliberation, the non-judgmental tone of the poetic voice, and the structure of the poem—absence of personal pronouns, adverbs, or over-reliance on adjectives—as well as the lines containing a &quot;kigo&quot; (季語, a &quot;season word&quot;) gives much of this poetry a haikuesque characteristic.

Kiarostami&#x27;s three volumes of original verse, plus his selections from classical and contemporary Persian poets, including Nima, Hafez, Rumi and Saadi, were translated into English in 2015 and were published in bilingual (Persian/English) editions by Sticking Place Books in New York.

==Personal life==
In 1969, Kiarostami married Parvin Amir-Gholi. They had two sons, Ahmad and Bahman. They divorced in 1982.

Kiarostami was one of the few directors who remained in Iran after the 1979 revolution, when many of his peers fled the country. He believes that it was one of the most important decisions of his career. His permanent base in Iran and his national identity have consolidated his ability as a filmmaker:
When you take a tree that is rooted in the ground and transfer it from one place to another, the tree will no longer bear fruit. And if it does, the fruit will not be as good as it was in its original place. This is a rule of nature. I think if I had left my country, I would be the same as the tree.

Kiarostami frequently wore dark spectacles or sunglasses, which he required because of a sensitivity to light.

==Illness and death==
In March 2016, Kiarostami was hospitalized due to intestinal bleeding and reportedly went into a coma after undergoing two operations. Sources, including a Ministry of Health and Medical Education spokesman, reported that Kiarostami was suffering from gastrointestinal cancer. On 3 April 2016, Reza Paydar, the director of Kiarostami&#x27;s medical team, made a statement denying that the filmmaker had cancer. However, in late June he left Iran for treatment in a Paris hospital, where he died on 4 July 2016. The week before his death, Kiarostami had been invited to join the Academy Awards in Hollywood as part of efforts to increase the diversity of its Oscar judges. Ali Ahani, Iran&#x27;s ambassador to France stated that Kiarostami&#x27;s body would be transferred to Iran to be buried at Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. However, it was later announced that his body would be buried in Lavasan, a resort town about northeast of Tehran, based on his own will, after it was flown back to Tehran from Paris. His body was returned to Tehran&#x27;s Imam Khomeini International Airport on 8 July 2016, while a crowd of Iranian film directors, actors, actresses and other artists were in Tehran airport to pay their respects.

Mohammad Shirvani, a fellow filmmaker and close friend, quoted Kiarostami on his Facebook wall on 8 June 2016: &quot;I do not believe I could stand and direct any more films. They [the medical team] destroyed it [his digestive system].&quot; After this comment, a campaign was set up by Iranians on both Twitter and Facebook to investigate the possibility of medical error during Kiarostami&#x27;s procedure. However, Ahmad Kiarostami, his eldest son, denied any medical error in his father&#x27;s treatment after Shirvani&#x27;s comment and said that his father&#x27;s health was no cause for alarm. After Kiarostami&#x27;s death, Head of the Iranian Medical Council Dr. Alireza Zali sent a letter to his French counterpart, Patrick Bouet, urging him to send Kiarostami&#x27;s medical file to Iran for further investigation. Nine days after Kiarostami&#x27;s death, on 13 July 2016, his family issued a formal complaint of medical maltreatment through Kiarostami&#x27;s personal doctor. Dariush Mehrjui, another famous Iranian cinema director, also criticized the medical team that treated Kiarostami and demanded legal action.

Martin Scorsese said he was &quot;deeply shocked and saddened&quot; by the news. Oscar-winning Iranian film-maker Asghar Farhadi – who had been due to fly to Paris to visit his friend – said he was &quot;very sad, in total shock&quot;. Mohsen Makhmalbaf echoed the sentiment, saying Iran&#x27;s cinema owes its global reputation to his fellow director, but that this visibility did not translate into greater visibility for his work in his homeland. &quot;Kiarostami gave the Iranian cinema the international credibility that it has today,&quot; he told &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;But his films were unfortunately not seen as much in Iran. He changed the world&#x27;s cinema; he freshened it and humanized it in contrast with Hollywood&#x27;s rough version.&quot; Persian mystic and poet Jalal al-Din Rumi&#x27;s 22nd niece Esin Celebi also expressed her condolences over the demise of Kiarostami in a separate message. Iran&#x27;s representative office at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO also opened a memorial book for signature to honour Kiarostami.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Twitter that the director&#x27;s &quot;different and profound attitude towards life and his invitation to peace and friendship&quot; would be a &quot;lasting achievement&quot;. Foreign Minister Mohammad-Javad Zarif also said Kiarostami&#x27;s death was a loss for international cinema. In a statement, French President François Hollande praised the director for forging &quot;close artistic ties and deep friendships&quot; with France.

Media, such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, CNN, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Associated Press&quot;, &quot;Euronews&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot; also reacted to Kiarostami&#x27;s death. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Abbas Kiarostami, Acclaimed Iranian Filmmaker, Dies at 76&quot; and Peter Bradshaw paid tribute to Kiarostami: &quot;a sophisticated, self-possessed master of cinematic poetry&quot;

The crowd that had gathered for this service in Paris held a vigil by the River Seine. They then allowed the waves of the Seine to carry away photos of Kiarostami that the crowd had left floating on the river. It was a symbolic moment of saying goodbye to a film director that many Iranians have come to passionately appreciate. 

===Funeral===

Artists, cultural authorities, government officials, and the Iranian people gathered to say goodbye to Kiarostami on 10 July in an emotional funeral, six days after his death in France. The ceremony was held at the Center for the Intellectual Education of Children, where he began his film-making career some 40 years before. Attendees held banners with the titles of his movies and pictures of his most famous posters, as they praised the support Kiarostami contributed to culture, and particularly to filmmaking in Iran. The ceremony was hosted by famous Iranian actor Parviz Parastooie, and included speeches by painter Aidin Aghdashlou and prize-winning film director Asghar Farhadi, who stressed his professional abilities. He was later buried in a private ceremony in the northern Tehran town of Lavasan.

==Sexual assault and plagiarism allegations==
In August 2020, Mania Akbari, who starred in &quot;Ten&quot;, accused Kiarostami of plagiarism, stating that he edited private footage shot by Akbari into the film without her permission. In her 2019 short film &quot;Letter to My Mother&quot;, Amina Maher, daughter of Akbari, who also appeared in &quot;Ten&quot;, said that her scenes in &quot;Ten&quot; were filmed without her knowledge. In 2022, Akbari and Maher revealed that they had been asking distributor to halt circulation of the film, to which MK2 has yet to respond. Consequently, the British Film Institute removed &quot;Ten&quot; from a Kiarostami retrospective.

In 2022, Akbari accused Kiarostami of raping her twice, in Tehran when she was 25 and he was about 60, and in London after &quot;Ten&quot; had premiered.

==Reception and criticism==
Kiarostami has received worldwide acclaim for his work from both audiences and critics, and, in 1999, he was voted the most important Iranian film director of the 1990s by two international critics&#x27; polls. Four of his films were placed in the top six of Cinematheque Ontario&#x27;s Best of the &#x27;90s poll. He has gained recognition from film theorists, critics, as well as peers such as Jean-Luc Godard, Nanni Moretti, and Chris Marker. Akira Kurosawa said of Kiarostami&#x27;s films: &quot;Words cannot describe my feelings about them ... When Satyajit Ray passed on, I was very depressed. But after seeing Kiarostami&#x27;s films, I thanked God for giving us just the right person to take his place.&quot;
Critically acclaimed directors such as Martin Scorsese have commented that &quot;Kiarostami represents the highest level of artistry in the cinema.&quot; The Austrian director Michael Haneke had admired the work of Abbas Kiarostami as among the best of any living director. In 2006, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s panel of critics ranked Kiarostami as the best contemporary non-American film director.

Critics such as Jonathan Rosenbaum have argued that &quot;there&#x27;s no getting around the fact that the movies of Abbas Kiarostami divide audiences—in this country, in his native Iran, and everywhere else they&#x27;re shown.&quot; Rosenbaum argues that disagreements and controversy over Kiarostami&#x27;s movies have arisen from his style of film-making because what in Hollywood would count as essential narrative information is frequently missing from Kiarostami&#x27;s films. Camera placement, likewise, often defies standard audience expectations: in the closing sequences of &quot;Life and Nothing More&quot; and &quot;Through the Olive Trees&quot;, the audience is forced to imagine the dialogue and circumstances of important scenes. In &quot;Homework&quot; and &quot;Close-Up&quot;, parts of the soundtrack are masked or silenced. Critics have argued that the subtlety of Kiarostami&#x27;s cinematic expression is largely resistant to critical analysis.
While Kiarostami has won significant acclaim in Europe for several of his films, the Iranian government has refused to permit the screening of his films, to which he responded &quot;The government has decided not to show any of my films for the past 10 years... I think they don&#x27;t understand my films and so prevent them being shown just in case there is a message they don&#x27;t want to get out&quot;.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Kiarostami was refused a visa to attend the New York Film Festival. The festival director, Richard Peña, who had invited him said, &quot;It&#x27;s a terrible sign of what&#x27;s happening in my country today that no one seems to realize or care about the kind of negative signal this sends out to the entire Muslim world&quot;. The Finnish film director Aki Kaurismäki boycotted the festival in protest. Kiarostami had been invited by the New York Film Festival, as well as Ohio University and Harvard University.

In 2005, London Film School organized a workshop as well as the festival of Kiarostami&#x27;s work, titled &quot;Abbas Kiarostami: Visions of the Artist&quot;. Ben Gibson, Director of the London Film School, said, &quot;Very few people have the creative and intellectual clarity to invent cinema from its most basic elements, from the ground up. We are very lucky to have the chance to see a master like Kiarostami thinking on his feet.&quot; He was later made Honorary Associate.

In 2007, the Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 co-organized a festival of the Kiarostami&#x27;s work titled &quot;Abbas Kiarostami: Image Maker&quot;.

Kiarostami and his cinematic style have been the subject of several books and three films, &quot;Opening Day of Close-Up&quot; (1996), directed by Nanni Moretti, &quot;Abbas Kiarostami: The Art of Living&quot; (2003), directed by Pat Collins and Fergus Daly, and &quot;Abbas Kiarostami: A Report&quot; (2014), directed by Bahman Maghsoudlou.

Kiarostami was a member of the advisory board of World Cinema Foundation. Founded by the director Martin Scorsese, its goal is to find and reconstruct world cinema films that have been long neglected.

<text>The Shooting Star () is the tenth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was serialised daily in , Belgium&#x27;s leading francophone newspaper, from October 1941 to May 1942 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin, who travels with his dog Snowy and friend Captain Haddock aboard a scientific expedition to the Arctic Ocean on an international race to find a meteorite that has fallen to the Earth.

&quot;The Shooting Star&quot; was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the first &quot;Tintin&quot; volume to be originally published in the 62-page full-colour format. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; has received a mixed critical reception and has been one of the more controversial installments in the series due to the perceived antisemitic portrayal of its villain. The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series, &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, and for the 1991 animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; by Ellipse and Nelvana.

==Synopsis==
A giant meteoroid approaches the Earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle; he and a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predict that the meteoroid will hit Earth and cause the end of the world. The meteoroid misses Earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and arranges an expedition to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their polar expedition ship, the &quot;Aurora&quot;, is helmed by Tintin&#x27;s friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another expedition is funded by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel, with a team setting out aboard the polar expedition ship &quot;Peary&quot;; thus, Phostle&#x27;s expedition becomes part of a race to land on the meteorite. 

On the day of the &quot;Aurora&quot;&#x27;s departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on the ship, but the dynamite is found and eventually thrown overboard. In one of the shipping lanes of the North Sea, the &quot;Aurora&quot; is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel&#x27;s ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur when &quot;Aurora&quot; has to refuel at Iceland, going to the port of Akureyri, where Haddock is informed that the Golden Oil Company (which is owned by Bohlwinkel&#x27;s bank and has a fuel monopoly) has no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, and Tintin comes up with a plan to trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need by secretly running a hose to &quot;Aurora&quot; from Chester&#x27;s ship, &quot;Sirius&quot;. As they are getting closer to the &quot;Peary&quot; the &quot;Aurora&quot; receives an indistinct distress call from another ship and the crew agrees to alter their course to help; however, Tintin exposes that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them, and they resume the journey. The &quot;Aurora&quot; intercepts a cable announcing that the &quot;Peary&quot; expedition has reached the meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the &quot;Peary&quot; crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the &quot;Aurora&quot;″s seaplane to get to and parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition&#x27;s flag, thus winning the race. 

Tintin and Snowy (who followed on the plane) make camp on the meteorite while the &quot;Aurora&quot;″s engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day, he finds immense explosive mushrooms, and discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot turns into a huge butterfly, and he and Snowy are menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, before the seaplane arrives again. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it starts sinking into the sea. Tintin gets himself, Snowy and a piece of Phostlite to the pilot of the seaplane in the plane&#x27;s life raft, as the meteorite itself finally disappears into the sea. Thereafter, Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As the &quot;Aurora&quot; returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whisky.

==History==

===Background===
Amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, Hergé became the founding editor of &quot;Le Soir Jeunesse,&quot; a children&#x27;s supplement in Belgium&#x27;s leading newspaper, &quot;Le Soir.&quot; Hergé&#x27;s previous employer, the Catholic newspaper &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; (which had originated &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; through its own children&#x27;s supplement, &quot;Le Petit Vingtième)&quot; was no longer allowed by the German authorities to continue publishing; &quot;Le Soir&quot;, in contrast, was allowed to stay open under the administrative control of the occupying military government. &quot;Le Soir Jeunesse&quot; serialized most of &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;&#x27;s immediate predecessor, &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, but ceased publication due to paper shortages in 1941. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was then moved to &quot;Le Soir&quot; itself, where &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; was concluded and the subsequent four &quot;Adventures&quot; (including &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;) were serialized.

During its initial serialization, &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; featured the United States as the primary antagonists; explaining this, Hergé asserted that the story revolved around the theme of &quot;the rivalry for progress between Europe and the United States&quot;. Although not disliking Americans themselves, he had a strong disdain for American big business, and had exhibited anti-American themes in earlier works, in particular in &quot;Tintin in America&quot;. During serialisation of &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, in December 1941, the U.S. entered the war on the side of the Allies, thus coming into direct conflict with Germany. All of the scientists featured were from Axis, neutral, or occupied countries which might be a reflection of the strip&#x27;s anti-Allies political slant. Hergé biographer Harry Thompson stated this should not be interpreted as a strong anti-Ally bias, for the only two nation-states in Europe that were part of the Allies at that point were the Soviet Union and United Kingdom, and that the characters of Haddock and Chester were British.

As he had done for other &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; which featured sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible in order to make his portrayals more realistic. The design of the &quot;Aurora&quot; was based on the RRS &quot;William Scoresby&quot;, while that of the &quot;Peary&quot; was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS &quot;Discovery&quot;. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if &quot;Aurora&quot; had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.

&quot;The Shooting Star&quot; shared plot similarities with &quot;The Chase of the Golden Meteor&quot;, a 1908 novel by pioneering French science-fiction writer Jules Verne. As in Hergé&#x27;s story, Verne&#x27;s novel features an expedition to the North Atlantic to find a meteorite fragment containing a new element. In both stories, the competing expedition teams were led by an eccentric professor and a Jewish banker, and Verne&#x27;s novel had a Doktor Schultze to Hergé&#x27;s Professor Schulze—both from the University of Jena. Hergé denied deliberately copying Verne&#x27;s story, saying that he had only read one of the French novelist&#x27;s works; it is possible that the influence from Verne came via Jacques Van Melkebeke, Hergé&#x27;s friend and assistant, who was a fan of the genre. The Swedish expedition member Eric Björgenskjöld physically resembles a real person: Auguste Piccard, who later became Hergé&#x27;s inspiration for Professor Calculus.

===Antisemitism===
Under Nazi control, &quot;Le Soir&quot; was publishing a variety of antisemitic articles, calling for the Jews to be further excluded from public life and describing them as racial enemies of the Belgian people. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline noted that there was a &quot;remarkable correlation&quot; between the antisemitic nature of &quot;Le Soir&quot; editorials and &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; depiction of Jews. Within months of the story&#x27;s publication, legislation was passed to collect and deport Jews from Belgium to Nazi concentration camps. Thus, &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; reflected trends in the Belgian political situation at the time. However, the story was not the first time that Hergé had adopted such a perspective in his work; he had recently provided illustrations for Robert de Vroyland&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot;, a number of which contained antisemitic stereotypes, reflecting the racism in much of de Vroyland&#x27;s book. Similarly, his depiction of the character of Rastapopoulos, who was introduced in &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, has been cited as being based upon antisemitic stereotypes.
When &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; appeared in &quot;Le Soir&quot;, Hergé featured a gag in which two Jews hear the prophetic news that the end of the world is near. They rub their hands together in eagerness, and one comments: &quot;Did you hear, Isaac? The end of the world! What if it&#x27;s true?&quot; The other responds: &quot;Hey, hey, it vould be a gut ding, Solomon! I owe my suppliers 50,000 francs, and zis way I von&#x27;t haf to pay vem!&quot; Hergé omitted this scene from the collected edition.
The character of Blumenstein displays antisemitic stereotypes, such as having a bulbous nose and being an avaricious, manipulative businessman. Hergé later dismissed concerns over this Jewish caricature, saying &quot;That was the style then&quot;. In his assessment of Franco-Belgian comics, Matthew Screech expressed the opinion that Blumenstein was an anti-American stereotype rather than an anti-Jewish one. Similarly, reporter and Tintin expert Michael Farr asserted that Blumenstein was &quot;more parodied as a financier than Jew&quot;. Conversely, Lofficier and Lofficier asserted that both anti-Americanism and antisemitism were present, and that it is the United States and International Jewry who were the &quot;ruthless opponents&quot; of Tintin. Nazi apologists and revisionists such as French Holocaust denier Olivier Mathieu used &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; as evidence that Hergé was an antisemite with Nazi sympathies.

To graphic novel specialist Hugo Frey, the competing expeditions are presented as a simplistic race between good and evil, wherein Blumenstein displays the stereotypes of Jews held by advocates of the Jewish World Conspiracy presented in works such as the antisemitic &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. Frey writes that Blumenstein&#x27;s &quot;large and bulbous nose ... rounded forehead, receding black hair, and small beady eyes&quot; were stock antisemitic imagery in the 1930s and 1940s, as promoted by those such as journalist Édouard Drumont, whose antisemitic Paris-based newspaper &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; was influential in Brussels. According to Frey, Blumenstein&#x27;s depiction as an overweight cigar-smoker reflected the antisemitic stereotype of Jews as being financially powerful, while he suggested that the scene in which Blumenstein learned that he was to be tracked down for his crimes recalled the contemporary roundup of Jews in Nazi Europe. Frey contrasts Hergé&#x27;s complicity with the antisemites to the actions of other Belgians, such as those who struck against the Nazis at the &quot;Université libre de Bruxelles&quot; and those who risked their lives to hide Jews.

===Publication===
&quot;The Shooting Star&quot; was serialised daily in from 20 October 1941 to 21 May 1942 in French under the title (&quot;The Mysterious Star&quot;). Tintin&#x27;s previous adventure, &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, had been serialised weekly until the demise of &quot;&quot;&#x27;s children&#x27;s supplement, , before continuing daily in the main newspaper itself; the earlier serial had ended the day before &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; began. &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; was the first &quot;Tintin&quot; adventure to be serialised daily in its entirety. As with earlier &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the story was later serialised in France in the Catholic newspaper &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;, where it first appeared on 6 June 1943.

On page 20 of the published book, Hergé included a cameo of the characters Thomson and Thompson and Quick &amp; Flupke. The story also introduced Captain Chester, who is mentioned in later adventures, and Professor Cantonneau, who returns in &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;.

On 21 May 1942, &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; concluded serialisation. Less than a week later, the occupied government proclaimed that all Jews in Belgium would have to wear a yellow badge on their clothing, and in July the Gestapo began raids on Jewish premises, followed by deportations of Jews to Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, resulting in around 32,000 Belgian Jews being killed. Hergé later recalled: &quot;I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star, but finally, I did see some. They told me that some Jews were gone; that people had come for them and sent them away. I didn&#x27;t want to believe it&quot;.

The earlier &quot;Tintin&quot; albums reproduced the newspaper strips, which had come to appear weekly in Thursday supplements, two-page allotments of three tiers to a page. War shortages reduced the space for the strip by a third, and later the supplements disappeared completely; the comic appeared daily in the main newspaper as a four-panel strip. For publication in book form, Casterman insisted that Hergé must adhere to a new album format of four sixteen-page signatures, which gave sixty-two pages of story plus a cover page. Though the format reduced the page count, it maintained the same amount of story by reducing the size of the panels reproduced. As &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; progressed, Hergé cut up and laid out clippings of the strip in an exercise book in preparation for the new layouts. It was the first volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be originally published in the 62-page full-colour format that thereafter was the series standard (as opposed to first being published in a black and white newspaper strip reproduction format that all prior books had done). Casterman published the album in September 1942. Unlike the previous books in the series, because it was printed immediately in colour, it did not need to be totally redrawn. The 177 daily strips from the original serialisation were not enough to fill the 62 pages Casterman had allotted, so Hergé added large panels, such as a half-page panel of a giant telescope on page three. Hergé wanted to include a small gold star inside the &quot;o&quot; of &quot;Étoile&quot; on the cover page, but Casterman refused, deeming it too expensive.

In 1954, Hergé began making various changes to the story for its re-publication. Aware of the controversy surrounding the depiction of Blumenstein, he renamed the character &quot;Bohlwinkel&quot;, adopting this name from , a Brussels dialect term for a confectionery store. He later discovered that, by coincidence, Bohlwinkel was also a Jewish name. Trying to tone down the book&#x27;s anti-American sentiment, he also changed the United States to a fictional South American nation called São Rico, replacing the U.S. flag flown by the &quot;Peary&quot;″s crew with that of the fictional state. In 1959, Hergé made a new list of changes to be made to the artwork in &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, which included altering Bohlwinkel&#x27;s nose, but the changes were postponed and never made.

==Adaptations==

In 1957, the animation company Belvision Studios produced a string of colour adaptations based on Hergé&#x27;s original comics, adapting eight of the &quot;Adventures&quot; into a series of daily five-minute episodes. &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; was the sixth to be adapted in the second animated series; it was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, a well-known cartoonist who was to become editor-in-chief of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine.

In 1991, a second animated series based upon &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana. &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; was the eighth story to be adapted and was a single twenty-minute episode. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot; to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Hergé&#x27;s original panels. Bohlwinkel was tactfully kept nameless in the adaptation and his arrest is shown.

In 2010, American cartoonist Charles Burns authored &quot;X&#x27;ed Out&quot;, a graphic novel with a variety of allusions to &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. In one scene, the protagonist Nitnit discovers a warehouse containing white eggs with red spots, akin to the mushrooms in &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, with the cover of Burns&#x27; book paying homage to Hergé. In 2015, the original front cover sketch of the book was sold for €2.5 million to a European investor, Marina David of Petits Papiers-Huberty-Breyne, at the Brussels Antiques and Fine Art Fair.

== Critical analysis ==
Pierre Assouline remarked that Hergé&#x27;s attention to accuracy lapsed in &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;. For instance, the meteorite&#x27;s approach toward Earth caused a heat wave, while the meteorite itself proceeded to float on the surface of the ocean. In reality, no such heat wave would have been caused, while the meteorite would have plunged to the sea floor, causing a tsunami. He noted that the concept of madness was a recurring theme throughout the story, and that there was &quot;an unreality in the whole adventure&quot;. Fellow biographer Benoît Peeters asserted that &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; was &quot;of great power and brilliant construction&quot;. Elsewhere, Peeters wrote that the book was &quot;notable for the entry of the fantastic into Hergé&#x27;s work&quot;.

Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier deemed the antisemitism a &quot;sad moment&quot; in the series, awarding the story one out of five stars. Nevertheless, they felt that the &quot;pre-apocalyptic ambiance is stark and believable&quot;, and that the giant mushrooms on the meteorite were a &quot;strange anticipation&quot; of the mushroom-clouds produced by the atomic bombings in 1945. Focusing on the characters of Professor Phostle and Philippulus, they asserted that both resembled Sophocles Sarcophagus from &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; and that the former was &quot;in the Jules Verne tradition&quot; of eccentric professors. According to philosopher Pascal Bruckner, Tintin experts find Philippulus a caricature of Marshal of France Philippe Pétain, who demanded the French repent imaginary sins when he took power. Philippe Goddin stated that the strips for this story &quot;kept the reader daily on tenterhooks in a story replete with new twists and humour&quot;.

Harry Thompson described &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; as &quot;the most important of all Hergé&#x27;s wartime stories&quot;, having &quot;an air of bizarre fantasy&quot; that was unlike his prior work. He observed that the character of Professor Phostle was a prototype for Professor Calculus, introduced later in the series. Michael Farr asserted that the apocalyptic setting of the story reflected the wartime mood in Europe. He characterises the opening pages of the story as being &quot;unique in work for the feeling of foreboding they convey&quot;, adding that &quot;Hergé daringly eschews the strip cartoonist&#x27;s recognised means of denoting a dream, deliberately confusing the reader&quot;. He felt that the &quot;flow of the narrative is less accomplished&quot; than in other stories, with &quot;spurts and rushes followed by slower passages, upsetting the rhythm and pace&quot;.

Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès psychoanalysed &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, describing it as &quot;the final attempt of the foundling [i.e. Tintin] to rid himself of the bastard [i.e. Haddock] and to preserve the integrity of his former values&quot;, pointing out that the first thirteen pages are devoted purely to the boy reporter. He also argued that Phostle and Philippus represent two-halves of &quot;an ambivalent father figure&quot; within the story, with the former prefiguring Calculus &quot;more than any other previous character&quot;. He suggests that when hiding on the &quot;Aurora&quot;, Philippus can be compared to The Phantom of the Opera, as he steals a stick of dynamite and climbs up the ship&#x27;s mast before threatening to detonate the weapon. Apostolidès believed that the shooting star itself is &quot;more a religious mystery than a scientific one&quot; and that Tintin is therefore &quot;the perfect one to figure it out in some religious way—that is, unrealistically&quot;. Apostolidès analysed the political component of the story in terms of &quot;the incarnation of unregulated capitalism against the spirit of European values&quot;, arguing that Hergé was adhering to &quot;a utopian vision that, in 1942, smacks of pro-German propaganda&quot;.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; represents the apex of the &quot;right-wing strain&quot; in Hergé&#x27;s work. He highlighted the instance in which Tintin impersonates God in order to give commands to Philippus as representing one of various occasions in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; where &quot;sacred authority manifests itself largely as a &quot;voice&quot;, and commanding—or commandeering—that voice is what guarantees power&quot;. McCarthy further observes that the image of a giant spider in a ball of fire, which appears near the start of the story, reflects the theme of madness that is again present throughout the series. Discussing the political elements of Hergé&#x27;s series, McCarthy also noted that in the original publication of the story, the spider which climbed in front of the observatory telescope and was thus magnified greatly was initially termed &quot;Aranea Fasciata&quot;; he saw this as an intentional satire of the threat to Europe posed by fascism.

<text>Urocyon (Greek: &quot;tailed dog&quot;) is a genus of Canidae which includes the gray fox (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;) and the island fox (&quot;Urocyon littoralis&quot;). These two fox species are found in the Western Hemisphere. Whole genome sequencing indicates that &quot;Urocyon&quot; is the most basal genus of the living canids. Fossils of what is believed to be the ancestor of the gray fox, &quot;Urocyon progressus&quot;, have been found in Kansas and date to the Upper Pliocene, with some undescribed specimens dating even older.

==Extant species==


==Extinct species==
==Cozumel fox==
The Cozumel fox is a critically endangered small gray fox found on the island of Cozumel, Mexico. The last reported sighting was in 2001, but surveys focusing on this species have not yet been carried out. In September 2023, a live Cozumel fox was rescued from a road and subsequently released.

The Cozumel fox has not been scientifically described, but is a dwarf form as is the island fox, but is slightly larger than the island fox, being up to three-quarters the size of the gray fox. No skins or complete skulls of the Cozumel fox exist in any museum exhibitions, so scientists have mainly examined sub-fossils collected during archaeological excavations of Mayan civilizations who inhabited the island about 1,500–500 years ago. Upon evaluating bones from about 12 adult individuals, scientists have concluded that the Cozumel fox is extremely small – approximately 60-80% the body size of other mainland specimens.

The fox had been isolated on the island of Cozumel for at least 5,000 years, and probably far longer. This would indicate that &quot;Urocyon&quot; had colonized the island before the first arrival of humans there.

<text>Mark Berry (born 18 April 1964), better known as Bez, is an English dancer, DJ and media personality. He is best known as a member of the rock bands Happy Mondays and Black Grape.

==Early life==
Mark Berry was born on 18 April 1964 in Bolton, Lancashire, the son of parents from the Norris Green district of Liverpool. His father was a detective inspector. He grew up in Little Hulton and Walkden, before moving to live with his grandparents in Wigan at the age of 16.

==Career==

Bez is best known as the maraca player, dancer, and &quot;de facto&quot; mascot of rock band Happy Mondays, having been invited by lead singer Shaun Ryder shortly after the band was formed. He is chiefly remembered for his bizarre style of dancing and use of maracas. The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Freaky Dancin&#x27;&quot;, was rumoured to be a tribute to Bez. However, Ryder stated that this was not the case in his autobiography &quot;Twistin&#x27; My Melon&quot;.

After the Happy Mondays broke up, Bez became a member of Ryder&#x27;s next group Black Grape, but he left them in 1997. That year, he had a feature on the BBC Two television programme &quot;The Sunday Show&quot; called &quot;Science with Bez&quot;. When both men faced large tax bills, Bez and Ryder reformed the Happy Mondays in 1998, but it was short-lived. A book about his experiences in both bands, &quot;Freaky Dancin&quot;&#x27; (), was published by Pan MacMillan in 1998. In the opening chapter, Bez detailed an incident during a Happy Mondays gig at Manchester&#x27;s Haçienda nightclub in 1986. In the middle of the set, he fell off the stage and cut his forehead. In the book, he writes, &quot;The doc tells me to take it easy and put my feet up. I thought, &#x27;I&#x27;m not fucking havin&#x27; that.&#x27; I got some of lead guitarist Moose&#x27;s acid, dripped it in the cut and ran back out with me shakers. Fuckin&#x27; raz!&quot;

He appeared on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in 2005, in order to pay off his outstanding tax bills, and was voted as the winner of the series. He used some of his winnings to improve the engine of his London black cab; the television show &quot;Pimp My Ride UK&quot; customised it to make it suit him. After the cab was &quot;pimped&quot;, it had twenty speakers, eight amps, two DVD players, fifteen TV screens and a camera on the grille linked to one of the screens, the sign saying &quot;TAXI&quot; on the top was changed to &quot;PIMP&quot;, and it had purple paint on the outside.

The &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (NME) carried a series of articles about famous members of bands whose musical contribution to their bandmates&#x27; success was negligible. The newspaper used the name &quot;Bez&quot; as a generic label for Chas Smash of Madness, Andrew Ridgeley of Wham!, Andy Fletcher of Depeche Mode, Paul Morley of Art of Noise, Linda McCartney of Wings, and Paul Rutherford of Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

In 2006, Bez was promoting a compilation album titled &quot;Bez&#x27;s Madchester Anthems: Sorted Tunes from Back in the Day&quot;. The Happy Mondays again reformed: the third incarnation of the group had Bez touring with them. On 2 July 2007, they released their first studio album in 15 years entitled &quot;Uncle Dysfunktional&quot;. On 4 September 2007, Bez went head-to-head with royal correspondent James Whitaker on ITV television programme &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Stupid&quot; and beat him. Bez and James taught each other about their respective specialist subjects: the Manchester music scene and royal etiquette, and then they were quizzed on what they had learnt. This was followed by a general knowledge round. Despite not knowing that the Queen has two birthdays, Bez won. His prize, as selected by James, was a bottle of expensive red wine and a decanter so he didn&#x27;t have to drink any &quot;poor person&#x27;s supermarket plonk&quot;.

Bez took part in Series 4 of &quot;Adrenaline Junkie&quot; (aired on 1 October 2008 on ITV2), the tasks involved taking on the world&#x27;s biggest bungee down the front of the dam which featured in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, building an ice hotel in the mountains, and undertook a jump from one cable car to another. On 29 January 2012, Ryder announced on the radio station XFM that the band would return with the original and definitive line-up of himself, his brother Paul Ryder on bass, Bez, Gary Whelan on drums, Rowetta as backing vocalist, Mark Day on guitar and Paul Davis on keyboards. They appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot;, and were interviewed by Phillip Schofield. The band announced in September 2012 that they were writing their first album with the original line-up in more than 20 years.

Bez was announced as the headliner on the DJ stage at upcoming festival Party in the Pines on 3 May 2014. In September 2018, he took part in a special episode of &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; where he and Rowetta competed against Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle from Pulp. Bez and Rowetta won the episode by earning a profit of £8, but it was later discovered that Firouzeh Razavi, at that time Bez&#x27;s girlfriend, had bought two of their items. As it was against the rules of the programme for friends and family of the teams to buy items the teams were selling, Cocker and Doyle were made the winners and Bez had to hand over £8 from his own pocket.

==Personal life==
Berry lives in Urmston, Greater Manchester. He is a fan of Manchester United. He is a beekeeper and beer brewer in his spare time, and has lived on land-shares in Herefordshire and Wales. At some point, he lived next door to Ryder in Padfield, Derbyshire.

Bez was declared bankrupt in 2005 and 2008.

In August 2010, Bez was convicted of physically assaulting his ex-girlfriend Monica Ward, with whom he has a son, by throttling and threatening to kill her. He was sentenced to four weeks in prison after having first received a community service sentence but refusing to co-operate. He was arrested at London&#x27;s Euston Station in November 2010 for breaching a restraining order granted to Ward following the assault, and escorted to appear before magistrates in Manchester. Bez also has two older sons. 

In November 2014, Bez became a patron of homeless organisation Coffee4Craig. The organisation started in 2013 when married couple Risha and Hendrix Lancaster lost Risha&#x27;s brother, Craig White, to a heroin overdose while sleeping rough. He is very active in his support, even inviting them to join him on the onstage bed in London during a Black Grape gig and frequently discussing the issue of homelessness.

Bez stood as a candidate for the Salford and Eccles constituency in the 2015 UK General Election. The incumbent Member of Parliament (MP), Hazel Blears, announced her intention to stand down at the election. Bez ran on a platform of &quot;free energy, free food and free anything&quot;. He received 703 votes (1.6% of the total turnout) which placed him in sixth position in the constituency. The seat was won by the new Labour Party candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey, who received 21,364 votes (49.4% of the total).

In January 2021, during the third lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, Bez began operating as an online fitness instructor producing content on YouTube under the title &quot;Buzzin’ with Bez&quot;.

Bez married his partner, fitness instructor Firouzeh Razavi, on 3 September 2022. The two had been in a relationship since 2014. Bez had made a Wooden Stonehenge for a &quot;Game of Thrones-&quot;style wedding.

==In popular culture==
In the film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, Bez is played by Chris Coghill.

In August 2021, it was announced that Bez would be a competitor on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; and in October 2021 that he would be a competitor on the fourteenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; in 2022.

<text>North Korea, officially the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, is formally a one-party state under the leadership of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea (WPK) as the sole governing party. There are also two other minor parties that must accept the WPK&#x27;s &quot;leading role&quot; as a condition of their existence.

As of the latest election in 2019, three parties (WPK, Korean Social Democratic Party, and Chondoist Chongu Party) and one organization (Chongryon) are represented in the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly, the country&#x27;s unicameral parliament.

<text>GE Transportation is a division of Wabtec. It was known as GE Rail and owned by General Electric until sold to Wabtec on February 25, 2019. The organization manufactures equipment for the railroad, marine, mining, drilling and energy generation industries. The company was founded in 1907. It is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, while its main manufacturing facility is located in Erie, Pennsylvania. Locomotives are assembled at the Erie plant, while engine manufacturing takes place in Grove City, Pennsylvania. In May 2011, the company announced plans to build a second locomotive factory in Fort Worth, Texas, which opened in January 2013.

== Rail products ==

GE Transportation is the largest producer of diesel–electric locomotives for both freight and passenger applications in North America, believed to hold up to a 70% market share of that market. The only other significant competitor is Caterpillar-owned Electro-Motive Diesel, holding an approximate 30% market share.
GE Transportation also produces related products, such as railroad signaling equipment, and parts for locomotives and railroad cars, as well as providing repair services for GE and other locomotives. Current locomotives in major production include the GE Evolution Series; for a complete listing, see the list of GE locomotives. 

=== History ===

GE produced its first locomotive in 1912, and continued to produce switcher locomotives through the 1920s and 30s, while also producing electrical equipment for diesel engines from other manufacturers. Heavy involvement in main-line rail transportation began with a partnership with ALCo in 1940. ALCo had been the second-largest producer of steam locomotives, and was moving into diesel traction, but needed help to compete with the newly-emergent GM Electro-Motive Division. In the partnership, ALCo built the locomotive bodies and prime movers, while GE supplied the electrical gear as well as marketing and servicing infrastructure.

At first, the partnership was reasonably successful, producing the popular RS-1 road switcher, but by 1950 Alco-GE was struggling to keep up with EMD. In 1953, GE dissolved their partnership with ALCo and took over the gas turbine–electric venture that had started series production the previous year. In 1956 GE launched the Universal Series, which succeeded in establishing them as the main competitor to EMD. The subsequent Dash 7 Series failed to build market share, however the Dash 8 Series did better and by the end of the 1990s the Dash 9 Series established a market lead which the Evolution Series extended.

In the spring of 2007, GE Transportation Systems rolled out a prototype hybrid diesel–electric locomotive to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. In September 2010, GE Transportation announced plans to commercialise a hybrid design by 2014–15.

On July 27, 2017, GE Transportation announced that all production of locomotives would move from Erie, Pennsylvania, to Fort Worth, Texas, by the end of 2018. However, following the merger with Wabtec, the Erie plant remained open as operations from the former MotivePower plant in Boise, Idaho, were consolidated at Erie. 

==Mergers and acquisitions==
In November 2015, French multinational Alstom, which now specialises in rail, acquired GE Transportation&#x27;s Signaling &amp; Train Control division.

On November 12, 2017, GE announced they would sell or spinoff the Transportation Division.

In addition to the railroad industry, GE Transportation, also serves the following industries: Marine, Mining, Stationary Power, Drilling, and Drivetrain Technologies (wind gear boxes).

On May 21, 2018, GE and Wabtec announced that GE Transportation, valued at $11.1 billion, would be divested from GE and subsequently merged with Wabtec in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction by early 2019. Upon completion on February 25, 2019, the merged company was 50.8% owned by Wabtec shareholders, with GE shareholders owning 24.3% and GE itself owning 24.9%; GE also received $2.9 billion in cash.

== Propulsion products ==
In addition to railroad locomotives and equipment, GE Transportation Systems also produces large electric motors and propulsion systems for the mining, oil drilling, and wind turbine industries. GE also provides medium-sized, medium-speed diesel engines for several smaller vessels, mostly tugboats and other similarly-sized vessels. These marine engines are marinized versions of their locomotive engines.

==Battery products==
GE’s battery business serves the rail, marine, telecommunications and energy sectors, including new smart grid technology.GE&#x27;s Durathon battery production takes place at their facility in Schenectady, New York.

A battery locomotive is in development as of 2020.

On November 13, 2020, GE sent out its first battery electric locomotive numbered 3000 to the BNSF Railway for testing on its mainline in California between Stockton and Barstow, California. It underwent various tests throughout 2021 to see the feasibility of a fully battery powered locomotive on the California main lines

<doc id="400451" wikidata="Q766026" url="?curid=400451" title="PGM-17 Thor">
<text>The PGM-17A Thor was the first operative ballistic missile of the United States Air Force (USAF). It was named after the Norse god of thunder. It was deployed in the United Kingdom between 1959 and September 1963 as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with thermonuclear warheads. Thor was in height and in diameter. 

The first generation of Thor missiles were rushed into service, and design mistakes resulted in a 24% launch failure rate. The competing PGM-19 Jupiter missile saw more use, but both were quickly eclipsed by the Air Force&#x27;s long range ICBM program, which could be fired from U.S. soil. By 1959, with the Atlas rocket well on its way to operational status, both Thor and Jupiter programs became obsolete as delivery vehicles, yet continued to be built and deployed until 1963 for political reasons and to maintain aerospace industry employment.

The missile&#x27;s lasting legacy continued as the Thor and later Delta families of space launch vehicles used boosters derived from the initial Thor missile, and continued on into the 21st century.

==History==
Fearful that the Soviet Union would deploy a long-range ballistic missile before the U.S., in January 1956 the USAF began developing the Thor, a intermediate-range ballistic missile. The program proceeded quickly as a stop-gap measure, and within three years of inception the first of 20 Royal Air Force Thor squadrons became operational in the UK. The UK deployment carried the codename &#x27;Project Emily&#x27;. One of the advantages of the design was that, unlike the Jupiter MRBM, the Thor could be carried by the USAF&#x27;s cargo aircraft of the time, which made its deployment more rapid. The launch facilities were not transportable and had to be built on site. Once the first generation of ICBMs based in the U.S. became operational, Thor missiles were quickly retired. The last of the missiles was withdrawn from operational alert in 1963.

A small number of Thors with &quot;Thrust Augmented Delta&quot; boosters and W-49 Mod 6 warheads remained operational in the anti-satellite missile role as Program 437 until April 1975. These missiles were based on Johnston Island in the Pacific Ocean and had the ability to destroy satellites in low Earth orbit. With prior warning of an impending launch, they could destroy a Soviet spy satellite soon after orbital insertion.

===Initial development===
Development of the Thor was initiated by the USAF in 1954. The goal was a missile system that could deliver a nuclear warhead over a distance of with a CEP of . This range would allow Moscow to be attacked from a launch site in the UK. The initial design studies were headed by Cmdr. Robert Truax (U.S. Navy) and Dr. Adolph K. Thiel (Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, formerly of Redstone Arsenal and previously of Nazi Germany). They refined the specifications to an IRBM with:

* A range
* diameter, long (so it could be carried by Douglas C-124 Globemaster)
* A gross takeoff weight of 
* Propulsion provided by half of the existing Navaho-derived Atlas booster engine
* maximum speed during warhead reentry
* Inertial guidance system with radio backup (for low susceptibility to enemy disruption)

Thor had vernier engines for roll control flanking the main engine, similar to the Atlas vernier engines on the sides of the propellant tanks.

On 30 November 1955, three companies were given one week to bid on the project: Douglas, Lockheed, and North American Aviation. The missile was to use existing technology, skills, abilities, and techniques to speed entry into service. On 27 December 1955, Douglas was awarded the prime contract for the airframe and integration. The Rocketdyne division of North American Aviation was awarded the engine contract, AC Spark Plug the primary inertial guidance system, Bell Labs the backup radio guidance system, and General Electric the nose cone/reentry vehicle. Douglas&#x27; proposal included choosing bolted tank bulkheads (as opposed to the initially suggested welded ones) and a tapered fuel tank for improved aerodynamics.

The engine was a direct descendant of the Atlas MA-3 booster engine, with removal of one thrust chamber and a rerouting of the plumbing to allow the engine to fit within the smaller Thor thrust section.

Engine component tests began in March 1956. The first engineering model engine was available in June, followed by the first flight engine in September. Early Thor engines suffered from foaming turbopump lubricating oil at high altitudes and bearing retention issues, resulting in several launch failures. The initial Thor tests in 1957 used an early version of the Rocketdyne LR-79 engine with a conical nozzle and of thrust. By early 1958, this had been replaced by an improved model with a bell-shaped nozzle see and of thrust. The fully developed Thor IRBM had of thrust.

===Phase I test launches===

Thor was test launched from LC-17 at Cape Canaveral Missile Annex. The compressed development schedule meant that plans for the Atlas bunker had to be used to allow the completion of the facility in time, with launchpad LC-17B completed just in time for the first test flight.

Missile 101, the first flight-ready Thor, arrived at Cape Canaveral in October 1956. It was erected at LC-17B and underwent several practice propellant loading/unloading exercises, a static firing test, and a month-long delay while a defective relay was replaced. Launch finally took place on 25 January 1957. The engine lost thrust almost immediately after liftoff, and the Thor fell onto the launch pad and exploded. A film of prelaunch preparations showed crews dragging a liquid oxygen (LOX) filler hose through a sandy area, which led to the belief that debris entering the LOX, caused the failure of a valve.

Thor 102 was launched on 20 April 1957. The booster performed normally, but the flight was terminated at 35 seconds after an erroneous console readout caused the Range Safety Officer to believe that the missile was headed inland instead of out to sea. The tracking console was found to be wired in reverse. The short flight raised confidence that Thor could fly successfully.

The third Thor launch (Missile 103) exploded four minutes before the planned launch after a defective valve allowed LOX tank pressure to build up to unsafe levels. The responsible technicians had also failed to pay attention to the tank pressure gauges. LC-17B consequently had to be repaired for the second time in four months.

Missile 104, launched 22 August from the newly opened LC-17A, broke up at T+92 seconds due to a drop in signal strength from the programmer, causing the engine to gimbal hard right. The guidance system tried to compensate, but the resulting structural loads exceeded the strength of the missile tankage.

Thor 105, on 20 September 1957, completed the first successful flight, which occurred 21 months after the start of the program. No telemetry equipment was included on this missile, with the resulting mass savings allowing a total range of .

Missile 107 (3 October) fell back onto LC-17A and exploded at launch when a gas generator valve failed to open.

Missile 108 (11 October) exploded around T+140 seconds without prior warning. Engineers were initially unable to determine the cause of the failure. After the first Thor-Able launch failed six months later due to a seized turbopump, it was concluded that a similar failure had occurred on 108. However, 108 did not have sufficient instrumentation to determine the exact nature of the failure.

The final three Thor tests during 1957 were all successful, but 1958 began with back-to-back failures. Thor 114 was destroyed by Range Safety 150 seconds into launch when the guidance system lost power and Thor 120&#x27;s engine shut down slightly under two minutes after liftoff. The telemetry system had experienced a power failure during launch, so the reason for the engine cutoff could not be satisfactorily determined.

On 19 April 1958, Missile 121 dropped back onto LC-17B and exploded, putting the pad out of action for three months. A fuel duct collapse was believed to have been the culprit.

On 22 April, Missile 117, carrying the first Able upper stage, lost thrust and broke up at T+146 seconds due to a turbopump failure.

The Jupiter, Thor, and Atlas missiles all used a variant of the Rocketdyne LR-79 engine and all three suffered launch failures due to a marginal turbopump design. There were two separate problems with the pumps. The first was the discovery during testing at Huntsville that the lubricant oil tended to foam at high altitude as the air pressure decreased. The other was that pump shaft vibration from the nearly 10,000 RPM operating speed would cause the bearings to come out of their sockets, resulting in the pump abruptly seizing up. The Army had suspended Jupiter launches for four months until the turbopump issues could be resolved, and as a result no more pump failures affected that program.

In contrast, the USAF&#x27;s General Schreiver rejected the idea of sending Thor and Atlas missiles back to the factory so as to not delay the testing program. Instead, in-field modifications to pressurize the turbopump gearboxes and use an oil with a different viscosity that was less prone to foaming were conducted. Modified bearing retainers were not installed. Subsequently, six consecutive Thor and Atlas launches failed during February–April 1958, several due to turbopump problems. The following four months did not include any turbopump failures, but the 17 August 1958, launch of the world&#x27;s first lunar probe on Thor-Able 127 ended in an explosion due to a turbopump failure. A month later, Atlas 6B also suffered a turbopump failure and the Air Force gave in and agreed to replace the turbopumps in all of their missiles, after which there were no more launch failures due to a turbopump problem.

Five successful Thor tests were conducted in June–July 1958, the last one carrying a mouse named Wickie on a biological mission; the capsule sank into the ocean and could not be recovered. Thor 126 (26 July) lost thrust 50 seconds into launch when a LOX valve inadvertently closed. The vehicle pitched down and broke up from aerodynamic loads. On 30 July 1958, six Douglas technicians were severely burned, three fatally, when a LOX valve failed at the Thor static test stand in Sacramento, California.

===Phase II launches===

Phase II testing with the AC Spark Plug inertial guidance system began 7 December with the first successful flight on 19 December 1957.

The operational variant of the Thor, the DM-18A, began testing in the autumn of 1958, but Missile 138 (5 November) went out of control shortly after liftoff and had to be destroyed. Nonetheless, Thor was declared operational and testing now began at Vandenberg Air Force Base on the West Coast when Missile 151 flew successfully on 16 December. On 30 December, a near repeat performance of the 5 November failure happened when Missile 149 lost control and was destroyed 40 seconds into launch.

After a run of successful launches during the first half of 1959, Missile 191, the first to be launched by a Royal Air Force crew, suffered another control malfunction while being launched from VAFB. This time, the missile&#x27;s pitch and roll program failed to activate and it continued flying straight up. Launch crews initially did nothing as they reasoned that the Earth&#x27;s rotation would gradually take it away from land and they wished to continue collecting data as long as possible. Eventually though, they became nervous about it exploding or pitching over, so the destruct command was sent around 50 seconds into launch. High-altitude wind caused debris to land in the town of Orcutt near the base. After Thor 203 repeated the same failure four weeks later, an investigation found that the culprit was a safety wire that had been meant to prevent the control tape in the programmer from inadvertently coming loose during vehicle assembly. The wire would ordinarily be cut after installation of the programmer in the missile, but Douglas technicians had forgotten this important step, thus the tape could not be spooled and the pitch and roll sequence did not activate. Another 23 Thor missile tests were carried out during 1959, with only one failure, when Missile 185 on 16 December, the second RAF launch, broke up due to a control malfunction.

===Service rivalry with Jupiter===
The Jupiter missile, a joint effort of Chrysler and the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, was originally designed to attack high-value targets like airfields, train switching yards and command and control sites with extremely high accuracy. The Redstone team, under the direction of Wernher von Braun, ultimately delivered an inertial guidance system that was accurate to about .

During development, the U.S. Navy became involved in the Jupiter program, with the objective of arming submarines with a ballistic missile. This led to the Jupiter&#x27;s squat shape, which allowed it to be stored within the confines of a submarine hull. However, the Navy was always concerned about the extremely risky situation of a liquid-fueled rocket stored in the confines of a submarine. By 1956, the Polaris program was proposed instead, which featured a solid-fueled SLBM that was much lighter and safer to store. The Navy quickly switched to Polaris and dropped Jupiter.

With two IRBMs of nearly identical capabilities, it seemed obvious that only one of the two would ultimately achieve operational status, resulting in a competition between the Army and Air Force. Jupiter&#x27;s testing program began two months after Thor&#x27;s and proceeded more smoothly. Accidents such as the explosion of Thor 103 were avoided, and the turbopump issues that plagued early Rocketdyne engines were also resolved in Jupiter much earlier than the Air Force&#x27;s missiles.

The Jupiter program was more successful due to far better testing and preparation, with each missile given a full duration static firing in Huntsville prior to delivery. Thors were given a PFRF (Pre Flight Readiness Firing) prior to launch; these were between 5 and 15 seconds only as the launching facilities were not designed for a full duration firing. Missile 107 had not been given a PFRF at all and its launch ended in a pad explosion. A static firing stand for Thor tests was only opened in May 1958, at which point the missile&#x27;s launch record stood at four successes and nine failures, including four launchpad explosions. For comparison, at the end of May 1958 Jupiter had five successes and three failures with no pad explosions. Thanks to the thorough testing done at Huntsville, Jupiter missiles mostly all arrived at CCAS in flight-ready condition while Thors typically required extensive repairs or modification before launch.

After the Soviet launches of Sputnik 1 and 2 in late 1957, U.S. Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson announced that both Thor and Jupiter would go into service as his final act before leaving office. This was both out of fear of Soviet capabilities and also to avoid political repercussions from the workplace layoffs that would result at either Douglas or Chrysler if one of the two missiles were canceled.

===Deployment===
Deployment of the IRBM fleet to Europe proved more difficult than expected, as no NATO members other than the UK accepted the offer to have Thor missiles stationed on their soil. Italy and Turkey both agreed to accept Jupiter missiles. Thor was deployed to the UK starting in August 1958, operated by 20 squadrons of RAF Bomber Command under US-UK dual key control. The first active unit was No. 77 Squadron RAF at RAF Feltwell in 1958, with the remaining units becoming active in 1959. All were deactivated by September 1963.

All 60 of the Thor missiles deployed in the UK were based at above-ground launch sites. The missiles were stored horizontally on transporter-erector trailers and covered by a retractable missile shelter. To fire the weapon, the crew used an electric motor to roll back the missile shelter, essentially a long shed mounted on steel rails, then used a powerful hydraulic launcher-erector to lift the missile to an upright position for launch. Once it was standing on the launch mount, the missile was fueled and could be fired. The entire launch sequence, from starting to roll back the missile shelter through to ignition of the rocket engine and lift-off, took approximately 15 minutes. Main engine burn time was almost 2.5 minutes, boosting the missile to a speed of . Ten minutes into its flight the missile reached an altitude of , close to the apogee of its elliptical flight path. At that point the reentry vehicle separated from the missile fuselage and began its descent toward the target. Total flight time from launch to target impact was approximately 18 minutes.

The Thor was initially deployed with a very blunt conical G.E. Mk 2 &#x27;heat sink&#x27; re-entry vehicle. They were later converted to the slender G.E. Mk 3 ablative RV. Both RVs contained a W-49 thermonuclear warhead with an explosive yield of 1.44 megatons.

The IRBM program was quickly eclipsed by the Air Force&#x27;s ICBM program and made redundant. By 1959, with Atlas well on its way to operational status, Thor and Jupiter became obsolete, although both remained in service as missiles until 1963. In retrospect, the IRBM program was a poorly conceived idea as it depended on the cooperation of NATO allies, most of whom were not willing to have nuclear missiles on their soil, and was also surpassed by the ICBM program, yet continued anyway for political reasons and a desire to keep the workforce at their respective assembly plants employed.

Thor&#x27;s lasting legacy was not as a missile, but its use as the basis for the Thor/Delta space launcher family into the 21st century.

===Nuclear-armed test flights===
* 2 June 1962, failed Bluegill flight, tracking lost after launch, Thor and nuclear device destroyed.
* 19 June 1962, failed Starfish flight, Thor and nuclear device destroyed 59 seconds after launch at altitude.
* 8 July 1962, Thor missile 195 launched a Mk4 reentry vehicle containing a W49 thermonuclear warhead to an altitude of . The warhead detonated with a yield of 1.45 Mt of TNT (6.07 PJ). This was the Starfish Prime event of nuclear test series Operation Fishbowl.
* 25 July 1962, failed Bluegill Prime flight, Thor and nuclear device destroyed on launch pad, which was contaminated with plutonium.

===1963 mystery cloud===
On 28 February 1963, a Thor rocket carrying a spy satellite into orbit was launched from Vandenberg Airforce Base. The rocket went off course and mission control detonated the rocket at an altitude of before it could reach orbit. The rocket detonation produced a large circular cloud that appeared over the southwestern United States. Due to its mysterious nature, appearing at a very high altitude and being visible for hundreds of miles, the cloud attracted widespread attention and was published by the news media. The cloud was featured on the cover of &quot;Science Magazine&quot; in April 1963, &quot;Weatherwise&quot; Magazine in May 1963, and had a full page image published in the May issue of &quot;Life Magazine&quot;. Prof. James MacDonald at the University of Arizona Institute for Atmospheric Physics investigated the phenomena and linked it to the Thor rocket launch after contacting military personnel at Vandenberg Air Force Base. When the launch records were later declassified, the United States Air Force released a memo explaining that the cloud was &quot;the result of a military operation&quot;, but did not clarify.

==Launch vehicle==

Despite being retired from deployment as a missile a few years after deployment, the Thor rocket found widespread use as a space launch vehicle. It was the first in a large family of space launch vehicles—the Delta rockets. The last remaining direct descendant of the Thor, the Delta II, was retired in 2018, and the Delta IV was based on mostly new technology, unlike the Delta II. The last rocket of the Delta rocket family flew on 9 April 2024.

<doc id="400452" wikidata="Q338994" url="?curid=400452" title="Accession Council">
<text>In the United Kingdom, the Accession Council is a ceremonial body which assembles in St James&#x27;s Palace in London upon the death of a monarch to make formal proclamation of the accession of the successor to the throne. Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, a new monarch succeeds automatically (demise of the Crown). The proclamation confirms by name the identity of the new monarch, expresses loyalty to the &quot;lawful and rightful Liege Lord&quot;, and formally announces the new monarch&#x27;s regnal name, while the monarch and others, in front of the council, sign and seal several documents concerning the accession. An Accession Council has confirmed every English (and later, British) monarch since James I in 1603.

==Composition and ceremony==

The accession council is made up of the following:
* All members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom;
* High Commissioners of Commonwealth realms;
* The Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London.
The members of the accession council are summoned to assemble at St. James&#x27;s Palace and it meets outside the presence chamber of the monarch, where the presiding officer or clerk of the privy council reads out the proclamation, and it is signed by the accession council witnesses. Orders are made with respect to public readings of the proclamation. 

Only the privy council is then summoned to attend the monarch, listen to the monarch&#x27;s address, the monarch signs several documents, and the documents are sealed. The two parts of the accession council meeting usually occur together, but if circumstances warrant may take place separately.

== Proclamation ==
The council&#x27;s Proclamation of Accession, which confirms the name of the heir, is signed by all the attendant Privy Counsellors.

The 2022 proclamation was:

Though proclamations have been worded broadly the same, they also vary as necessary. In the case of Victoria, certain words were included (having regard to section 2 of the Regency Act 1830 prescribing the Oath of Allegiance) which expressly reserved the rights of any child of the late king, William IV, which might be borne to his widow, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. In the case of George VI, the proclamation was reworded because Edward VIII had abdicated, rather than died. The title &quot;Emperor of India,&quot; assumed by Queen Victoria well into her reign, was added at the end of the list of titles at the proclamations of Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII and George VI, during whose reign that title was relinquished. In the case of Charles III, the proclamation was reworded to include the House of Commons for the first time. The formula &quot;The King is dead. Long live the King!&quot;, of French royal origin, is not part of the official proclamation in the United Kingdom, contrary to popular belief.

The proclamation has been ceremonially read out in various locations around the kingdom. By custom, it is usually first read from the Proclamation Gallery of Friary Court at St James&#x27;s Palace by the heralds of the College of Arms. Other readings in London have historically followed, concluding at the Royal Exchange in the presence of the Lord Mayor of London. Local proclamation events then occur, such as one at the original location of Mercat Cross in Edinburgh by the heralds of the Court of the Lord Lyon. In 2022, the first reading at the palace was televised live, and other readings in London were omitted except for the one at the Exchange.

== Oaths ==
Under the Acts of Union 1707, monarchs are required upon succeeding to the throne to make an oath to &quot;maintain and preserve&quot; the Church of Scotland. This oath is normally made at the Accession Council. The provision in Article XXV Section II of the Acts of Union 1707 states with respect to confirmed Acts of Scotland:

Once the monarch makes a sacred oath to the council, the Garter Principal King of Arms steps onto the Proclamation Gallery which overlooks Friary Court to proclaim the new monarch.

Queen Elizabeth II was in Kenya when she acceded to the throne, and the Accession Council therefore met twice, first for the proclamation and again so that the new Queen could take the oath.

Upon accession, a new sovereign is also required to make what is known as the Accession Declaration. This is not usually made at a meeting of the Accession Council but in the presence of Parliament on the first State Opening following the monarch&#x27;s accession to the throne or at their coronation, whichever occurs first. King George VI made the declaration at his coronation.

<doc id="400457" wikidata="Q1202008" url="?curid=400457" title="Database transaction schedule">
<text>In the fields of databases and transaction processing (transaction management), a schedule (or history) of a system is an abstract model to describe the order of executions in a set of transactions running in the system. Often it is a &quot;list&quot; of operations (actions) ordered by time, performed by a set of transactions that are executed together in the system. If the order in time between certain operations is not determined by the system, then a &quot;partial order&quot; is used. Examples of such operations are requesting a read operation, reading, writing, aborting, committing, requesting a lock, locking, etc. Often, only a subset of the transaction operation types are included in a schedule. 

Schedules are fundamental concepts in database concurrency control theory. In practice, most general purpose database systems employ conflict-serializable and strict recoverable schedules.

==Notation==
Grid notation:

* Columns: The different transactions in the schedule.
* Rows: The time order of operations (a.k.a., actions).
Operations (a.k.a., actions):

* R(X): The corresponding transaction &quot;reads&quot; object X (i.e., it retrieves the data stored at X). This is done so that it can modify the data (e.g., X=X+4) during a &quot;write&quot; operation rather than merely overwrite it. When the schedule is represented as a list rather than a grid, the action is represented as formula_1 where formula_2 is a number corresponding to a specific transaction.
* W(X): The corresponding transaction &quot;writes&quot; to object X (i.e., it modifies the data stored at X). When the schedule is represented as a list rather than a grid, the action is represented as formula_3 where formula_2 is a number corresponding to a specific transaction.
* Com.: This represents a &quot;commit&quot; operation in which the corresponding transaction has successfully completed its preceding actions, and has made all its changes permanent in the database.
Alternatively, a schedule can be represented with a &quot;directed acyclic graph&quot; (or DAG) in which there is an arc (i.e., directed edge) between each &quot;ordered pair&quot; of operations.

=== Example ===
The following is an example of a schedule:

In this example, the columns represent the different transactions in the schedule D. Schedule D consists of three transactions T1, T2, T3. First T1 Reads and Writes to object X, and then Commits. Then T2 Reads and Writes to object Y and Commits, and finally, T3 Reads and Writes to object Z and Commits.

The schedule D above can be represented as list in the following way:

D = R1(X) W1(X) Com1 R2(Y) W2(Y) Com2 R3(Z) W3(Z) Com3

== Duration and order of actions ==
Usually, for the purpose of reasoning about concurrency control in databases, an operation is modelled as &quot;atomic&quot;, occurring at a point in time, without duration. Real executed operations always have some duration.

Operations of transactions in a schedule can interleave (i.e., transactions can be executed concurrently), but time orders between operations in each transaction must remain unchanged. The schedule is in &quot;partial order&quot; when the operations of transactions in a schedule interleave (i.e., when the schedule is conflict-serializable but not serial). The schedule is in &quot;total order&quot; when the operations of transactions in a schedule do not interleave (i.e., when the schedule is serial). 

==Types of schedule==
A complete schedule is one that contains either an abort (a.k.a. rollback) or commit action for each of its transactions. A transaction&#x27;s last action is either to commit or abort. To maintain atomicity, a transaction must undo all its actions if it is aborted.

===Serial===

A schedule is serial if the executed transactions are non-interleaved (i.e., a serial schedule is one in which no transaction starts until a running transaction has ended).

Schedule D is an example of a serial schedule:
===Serializable===

A schedule is serializable if it is equivalent (in its outcome) to a serial schedule. 

In schedule E, the order in which the actions of the transactions are executed is not the same as in D, but in the end, E gives the same result as D.
Serializability is used to keep the data in the data item in a consistent state. It is the major criterion for the correctness of concurrent transactions&#x27; schedule, and thus supported in all general purpose database systems. Schedules that are not serializable are likely to generate erroneous outcomes; which can be extremely harmful (e.g., when dealing with money within banks).

If any specific order between some transactions is requested by an application, then it is enforced independently of the underlying serializability mechanisms. These mechanisms are typically indifferent to any specific order, and generate some unpredictable partial order that is typically compatible with multiple serial orders of these transactions.

====Conflicting actions====

Two actions are said to be in conflict (conflicting pair) if and only if all of the 3 following conditions are satisfied:

# The actions belong to different transactions.
# At least one of the actions is a write operation.
# The actions access the same object (read or write).
Equivalently, two actions are considered conflicting if and only if they are noncommutative. Equivalently, two actions are considered conflicting if and only if they are a read-write, write-read, or write-write conflict.

The following set of actions is conflicting:
* R1(X), W2(X), W3(X) (3 conflicting pairs)

While the following sets of actions are not conflicting: 
* R1(X), R2(X), R3(X)
* R1(X), W2(Y), R3(X)
Reducing conflicts, such as through commutativity, enhances performance because conflicts are the fundamental cause of delays and aborts.

The conflict is materialized if the requested conflicting operation is actually executed: in many cases a requested/issued conflicting operation by a transaction is delayed and even never executed, typically by a lock on the operation&#x27;s object, held by another transaction, or when writing to a transaction&#x27;s temporary private workspace and materializing, copying to the database itself, upon commit; as long as a requested/issued conflicting operation is not executed upon the database itself, the conflict is non-materialized; non-materialized conflicts are not represented by an edge in the precedence graph.

====Conflict equivalence====

The schedules S1 and S2 are said to be conflict-equivalent if and only if both of the following two conditions are satisfied:

# Both schedules S1 and S2 involve the same set of transactions such that each transaction has the same actions in the same order.
# Both schedules have the same set of conflicting pairs (such that the actions in each conflicting pair are in the same order). This is equivalent to requiring that all conflicting operations (i.e., operations in any conflicting pair) are in the same order in both schedules.
Equivalently, two schedules are said to be conflict equivalent if and only if one can be transformed to another by swapping pairs of non-conflicting operations (whether adjacent or not) while maintaining the order of actions for each transaction.

Equivalently, two schedules are said to be conflict equivalent if and only if one can be transformed to another by swapping pairs of non-conflicting adjacent operations with different transactions.

====Conflict-serializable====

A schedule is said to be conflict-serializable when the schedule is conflict-equivalent to one or more serial schedules.

Equivalently, a schedule is conflict-serializable if and only if its precedence graph is acyclic when only committed transactions are considered. Note that if the graph is defined to also include uncommitted transactions, then cycles involving uncommitted transactions may occur without conflict serializability violation.

The schedule K is conflict-equivalent to the serial schedule &lt;T1,T2&gt;, but not &lt;T2,T1&gt;.
Conflict serializability can be enforced by restarting any transaction within the cycle in the precedence graph, or by implementing two-phase locking, timestamp ordering, or serializable snapshot isolation.

====View equivalence====

Two schedules S1 and S2 are said to be view-equivalent when the following conditions are satisfied:

# If the transaction formula_5 in S1 reads an initial value for object X, so does the same transaction formula_5 in S2. 
# If the transaction formula_5 reads a value (for an object X) written by the transaction formula_8 in S1, it must do so S2.
# If the transaction formula_5 in S1 does the final write for object X, so does the same transaction formula_5 in S2.
Additionally, two view-equivalent schedules must involve the same set of transactions such that each transaction has the same actions in the same order.

In the example below, the schedules S1 and S2 are view-equivalent, but neither S1 nor S2 are view-equivalent to the schedule S3.

The conditions for S3 to be view-equivalent to S1 and S2 were not satisfied at the corresponding superscripts for the following reasons:

# Failed the first condition of view equivalence because T1 read the initial value for B in S1 and S2, but T2 read the initial value for B in S3.
# Failed the second condition of view equivalence because T2 read the value written by T1 for B in S1 and S2, but T1 read the value written by T2 for B in S3.
# Failed the third condition of view equivalence because T2 did the final write for B in S1 and S2, but T1 did the final write for B in S3.
To quickly analyze whether two schedules are view-equivalent, write both schedules as a list with each action&#x27;s subscript representing which view-equivalence condition they match. The schedules are view equivalent if and only if all the actions have the same subscript (or lack thereof) in both schedules:

* S1: R1(A)initial read, W1(A), R1(B)initial read, W1(B), Com1, R2(A)written by T1, W2(A)final write, R2(B)written by T1, W2(B)final write, Com2
* S2: R1(A)initial read, W1(A), R2(A)written by T1, W2(A)final write, R1(B)initial read, W1(B), Com1, R2(B)written by T1, W2(B)final write, Com2
* S3: R1(A)initial read, W1(A), R2(A)written by T1, W2(A)final write, R2(B)initial read, W2(B), R1(B)written by T2, W1(B)final write, Com1, Com2

====View-serializable====

A schedule is view-serializable if it is view-equivalent to some serial schedule. Note that by definition, all conflict-serializable schedules are view-serializable.
Notice that the above example (which is the same as the example in the discussion of conflict-serializable) is both view-serializable and conflict-serializable at the same time. There are however view-serializable schedules that are not conflict-serializable: those schedules with a transaction performing a blind write:

The above example is not conflict-serializable, but it is view-serializable since it has a view-equivalent serial schedule &lt;T1,| T2,| T3&gt;.

Since determining whether a schedule is view-serializable is NP-complete, view-serializability has little practical interest.

===Recoverable===

In a recoverable schedule, transactions only commit after all transactions whose changes they read have committed. A schedule becomes unrecoverable if a transaction formula_5 reads and relies on changes from another transaction formula_8, and then formula_5 commits and formula_8 aborts.

These schedules are recoverable. The schedule F is recoverable because T1 commits before T2, that makes the value read by T2 correct. Then T2 can commit itself. In the F2 schedule, if T1 aborted, T2 has to abort because the value of A it read is incorrect. In both cases, the database is left in a consistent state.

Schedule J is unrecoverable because T2 committed before T1 despite previously reading the value written by T1. Because T1 aborted after T2 committed, the value read by T2 is wrong. Because a transaction cannot be rolled-back after it commits, the schedule is unrecoverable.

====Cascadeless====

Cascadeless schedules (a.k.a, &quot;Avoiding Cascading Aborts (ACA) schedules&quot;) are schedules which avoid cascading aborts by disallowing dirty reads. Cascading aborts occur when one transaction&#x27;s abort causes another transaction to abort because it read and relied on the first transaction&#x27;s changes to an object. A dirty read occurs when a transaction reads data from uncommitted write in another transaction.

The following examples are the same as the ones in the discussion on recoverable:
In this example, although F2 is recoverable, it does not avoid 
cascading aborts. It can be seen that if T1 aborts, T2 will have to 
be aborted too in order to maintain the correctness of the schedule 
as T2 has already read the uncommitted value written by T1.

The following is a recoverable schedule which avoids cascading abort. Note, however, that the update of A by T1 is always lost (since T1 is aborted).

Note that this Schedule would not be serializable if T1 would be committed.
Cascading aborts avoidance is sufficient but not necessary for a schedule to be recoverable.

====Strict====

A schedule is strict if for any two transactions T1, T2, if a write operation of T1 precedes a &quot;conflicting&quot; operation of T2 (either read or write), then the commit or abort event of T1 also precedes that conflicting operation of T2. For example, the schedule F3 above is strict.

Any strict schedule is cascade-less, but not the converse. Strictness allows efficient recovery of databases from failure.

== Serializability class relationships ==

The following expressions illustrate the hierarchical (containment) relationships between serializability and recoverability classes:

* Serial ⊂ conflict-serializable ⊂ view-serializable ⊂ all schedules
* Serial ⊂ strict ⊂ cascadeless (ACA) ⊂ recoverable ⊂ all schedules

The Venn diagram (below) illustrates the above clauses graphically.

* Strong strict two-phase locking (SS2PL or Rigorousness).

* Global serializability, where the &quot;Global serializability problem&quot; and its proposed solutions are described.
* Linearizability, a more general concept in concurrent computing.

<text>In project management, a schedule is a listing of a project&#x27;s milestones, activities, and deliverables. Usually dependencies and resources are defined for each task, then start and finish dates are estimated from the resource allocation, budget, task duration, and scheduled events. A schedule is commonly used in the project planning and project portfolio management parts of project management. Elements on a schedule may be closely related to the work breakdown structure (WBS) terminal elements, the Statement of work, or a Contract Data Requirements List.

==Overview==
In many industries, such as engineering and construction, the development and maintenance of the project schedule is the responsibility of a full-time scheduler or team of schedulers, depending on the size and the scope of the project. The techniques of scheduling are well developed but inconsistently applied throughout industry. Standardization and promotion of scheduling best practices are being pursued by the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering (AACE), the Project Management Institute (PMI), and the US Government for acquisition and accounting purposes.

Project management is not limited to industry; the average person can use it to organize their own life. Some examples are:
* Homeowner renovation project
* Keeping track of all the family activities
* Coaching a team
* Planning a vacation
* Planning a wedding

Some project management software programs provide templates, lists, and example schedules to help their users with creating their schedule.

== Methods ==
The project schedule is a calendar that links the tasks to be done with the resources that will do them. It is the core of the project plan used to show the organization how the work will be done, commit people to the project, determine resource needs, and used as a kind of checklist to make sure that every task necessary is performed. Before a project schedule can be created, the schedule maker should have a work breakdown structure (WBS), an effort estimate for each task, and a resource list with availability for each resource. If these components for the schedule are not available, they can be created with a consensus-driven estimation method like Wideband Delphi.

To develop a project schedule, the following needs to be completed:
* Project scope
* Sequence of activities
* Tasks grouped into 5 project phases (conception, definition &amp; planning, launch, performance, close)
* Task dependencies map
* Critical path analysis
* Project milestones

In order for a project schedule to be healthy, the following criteria must be met:

* The schedule must be constantly updated (weekly works best).
* The EAC (Estimation at Completion) value must be equal to the baseline value.
* The remaining effort must be appropriately distributed among team members (taking vacations into consideration).

The schedule structure may closely follow and include citations to the index of work breakdown structure or deliverables, using decomposition or templates to describe the activities needed to produce the deliverables defined in the WBS.

A schedule may be assessed for the quality of the schedule development and the quality of the schedule management.

<text>In sport, a goal may refer to either an instance of scoring, or to the physical structure or area where an attacking team must send the ball or puck in order to score points. The structure of a goal varies from sport to sport, and one is placed at or near each end of the playing field for each team to defend. Sports which feature goal scoring are also commonly known as invasion games.

For many sports, each goal structure usually consists of two vertical posts, called &quot;goal posts&quot;, supporting a horizontal &quot;crossbar&quot;. A &quot;goal line&quot; marked on the playing surface between the goal posts demarcates the goal area. Thus, the objective is to send the ball or puck between the goal posts, under or over the crossbar (depending on the sport), and across the goal line. Other sports may have other types of structures or areas where the ball or puck must pass through, such as the basketball hoop.

In several sports, sending the ball or puck into the opponent&#x27;s goal structure or area is the sole method of scoring, and thus the final score is expressed in the total number of goals scored by each team. In other sports, a goal may be one of several scoring methods, and thus may be worth a different set number of points than the others.

==Methods of scoring==
In some sports, the goal is the sole method of scoring. In these sports, the final score is expressed as the number of goals scored by each team, with the winner being the team that accumulated more over the specified time period.

In other sports, a goal is not the sole method of scoring. In these sports, the goal is worth a set number of points but there are other methods of scoring which may be worth more, the same, or fewer points. In these sports, the score is expressed as the total number of points earned by each team. In Australian rules football the score is expressed by listing the quantity of each team&#x27;s &quot;goals&quot; and &quot;behinds&quot; followed by the total number of points.

==Structure==

The structure of a goal varies from sport to sport. Most often, it is a rectangular structure that is placed at each end of the playing field. Each structure usually consists of two vertical posts, called &quot;goal posts&quot; (side bar or uprights) supporting a horizontal &quot;crossbar&quot;. A &quot;goal line&quot; marked on the playing surface between the goal posts demarcates the goal area.

In some games, such as association football or hockey, the object is to pass the ball between the posts below the crossbar, while in others, such as those based on rugby, the ball must pass over the crossbar instead. In Gaelic football and hurling, in which the goalposts are similar to those used in rugby, the ball can be kicked either under the crossbar for a goal, or over the crossbar between the posts for a point. In Australian rules football, there is no crossbar but four uprights instead. In basketball, netball or korfball, goals are ring-shaped. The structure is often accompanied with an auxiliary net, which stops or slows down the ball when a goal is scored. In netball, a single post at each end of the court supports a horizontal hoop that the ball must fall through. In basketball, the hoop and net used for scoring can be supported on a post or mechanism at each end, or on structures attached directly to the wall.

== Goal sports ==

===Goal-only sports===
The goal is the only method of scoring in several games. In each of these cases, the winner is the team that scores the most goals within the specified time.

==== Association football ====
In association football, the goal is the only method of scoring. It is also used to refer to the scoring structure. An attempt on goal is referred to as a &quot;shot&quot;. To score a goal, the ball must pass completely over the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar and no rules may be violated on the play (such as touching the ball with the hand or arm). See also offside.

The goal structure is defined as a frame 24 feet (7.32 m) wide by 8 feet (2.44 m) tall. In most organized levels of play a net is attached behind the goal frame to catch the ball and indicate that a goal has been scored; but the Laws of the Game do not mandate the use of a net and only require that any net used not interfere with the goalkeeper.

In Beach soccer the goal is defined as a frame 5.50 m wide by 2.20 m tall.

In Futsal the goal is defined as a frame 3 m wide by 2 m tall.

====Hockey====

===== Bandy =====

In bandy, which has much of its structure from association football, the only way of scoring is to make a goal and the goal is also used to refer to the scoring structure. If neither of the teams has scored during a match, or if both teams have made the same number of goals, there is a draw unless it is a playoff game, which is then determed by overtime and eventually also a penalty shootout. If not otherwise decided in the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy, an approved goal is made when the ball is played in a regular manner and the whole ball has passed the inner definition of the goal line between the two goal posts and the cross-bar. This is stated in section 9 of the Rules. A goal can be made directly from a stroke-off, penalty-shot, a free-stroke, a face-off or a corner stroke. Centered at each short-line of the bandy field is a wide and high goal cage, regulated to size, form, material and other properties in section 1.4 of the Bandy Playing Rules. The cage has a net to stop the ball when it has crossed the goal-line. The cage shall be of an approved model. In front of the goal cage is a half-circular penalty area with a radius. A penalty spot is located in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a circle.

===== Field Hockey =====
The goal structure in field hockey is wide by tall. Like association football, a goal is scored when the ball passes completely over the goal line under the crossbar and between the goal posts. Nets are required to hold the ball in. A goal is only scored if shot from within a semicircle from the goal.

===== Ice Hockey =====
In ice hockey, the puck must be put completely over the goal line between the posts and under the bar either off an offensive player&#x27;s stick or off any part of a defensive player&#x27;s body. The puck may not be kicked, batted, or thrown into the goal, though a goal may be awarded if the puck is inadvertently deflected off an offensive player&#x27;s skate or body into the goal. The goal structure is a frame tall and wide with a net attached. In most higher levels of play the goal structure is attached to the ice surface by flexible pegs and will break away for safety when hit by a player. The goal is placed within the playing surface, and players may play the puck behind the goal.

==== Handball ====
A goal in handball is scored when the ball is thrown completely over the goal line, below the crossbar and between the goal posts. The goal structure in team handball is 2 metres high and 3 metres wide. A net is required to catch the ball.

====Lacrosse====
Lacrosse goals are scored when the ball travels completely past the goal line. Goals can be disallowed if there is an infraction by the offensive team. The goal in lacrosse is tall and wide and a net is used to prevent the ball from reentering the field of play. Lacrosse goals are not positioned on the end boundary line; play often occurs behind the goal.

====Netball====
In netball, a goal is scored when the ball is shot through a goal ring on a pole.

====Polo====
In polo, a goal is scored if the ball passes completely between the goal posts, regardless of how far off the ground the ball is. The ball must be between the goal posts or the imaginary lines extending above the inside edges of the posts. A ball passing directly over a goal post does not score a goal.

The goal structure in Polo consists of two poles, at least high and exactly 8 yards apart. There is no crossbar and no net is required. The height at which a goal may be scored is infinite.

==== Hardcourt Bike Polo ====
In Hardcourt Bike Polo, a goal is scored if the ball passes completely over the goal line and the shot originated as a &quot;shot&quot; as defined by the rules. A shot is made with either end of the mallet head similar to swinging a hammer whereas a shuffle is made with the long side like pushing a broom. Traditionally when using a non-netted goal such as two traffic cones the play is continued if the ball is shuffled through the goal of pass through the goal from the opposite direction. These non-netted goals are no long regulation in competitive play but are common depending on the resources of a club.

==== Shinty ====
In shinty, a goal is scored if the ball goes over the goal line and under the crossbar. A goal can only be scored with a stick called a &quot;caman&quot;; no goal is scored if the ball is kicked, carried, or propelled by an attacking player&#x27;s hand or arm.

==== Treibball ====
In Treibball, a point is scored when a dog knocks a ball (referred to as a rolling sheep) into the goal. Rolling sheep must be knocked into the goal in a particular order within the seven minute time limit.

====Water polo====

A goal in water polo is scored when the ball passes completely across the goal line, under the crossbar and between the goal posts. A goal may be scored through contact with any part of the attacker&#x27;s body except a clenched fist. The goal structure in water polo is dependent upon the depth of the water. The goal mouth measures 3 metres across and is either 0.9 metres above the surface of the water or 2.4 metres above the floor of the pool, whichever is higher. Nets are required.

===Games with secondary scoring other than goals===
The following games have more than one possible method of scoring where the goal is the primary method, &quot;i.e.&quot; the method that scores the most points. In most cases the score is shown as the number of goals, plus the number of secondary scores (usually 1 point), plus the total number of points. The side with the higher number of total points is the winner.

====Australian rules football====

In Australian rules football a goal is scored when the ball is kicked by an attacking player completely between the two tall goal posts. To be awarded a goal, the ball may not contact or pass over the goal post, or touch any player on any part of the body other than the foot or lower leg of an attacker. In such cases, the score is a behind (1 point). The ball may be punted, drop kicked, or kicked off the ground (soccered). The ball may cross the goal line at any height from ground level up and may bounce before crossing the line. A goal scores six points. The behind, which scores one point; is awarded if the ball passes between the point posts or is not awarded a goal by the above provisions when passing through the goal posts. The goal structure consists of two posts at least 6 metres in height and spaced 6.4 metres apart. There is no crossbar and no net.

====Basketball====
The primary object of basketball is to score by shooting (i.e., throwing) the ball into a goal officially called the basket. A basket is scored when the ball passes completely through the basket ring from above; however, the number of points scored with each basket depends on where on the court the ball was shot from, and a team does not necessarily need to score the most baskets to win the game. Basketball scores are expressed in total points.

A basket scored during normal play is called a field goal and is worth two points if shot from within or on the three-point line, and three points if shot from beyond the three-point line. The three-point line&#x27;s distance from the basket varies by level. Points are also awarded to the shooting team if the defensive team commits goaltending or basket interference while the ball is in flight towards the basket or is directly over it.

A basketball team can also score by free throws, which score one point each. Free throws are awarded to a team after the opponent commits a foul in certain scenarios. The player taking the free throws (usually the player who was fouled) is entitled to take a specified number of shots unopposed with both feet behind the free throw line.

The basket consists of a metal ring in internal diameter, suspended horizontally above the floor such that the center of the ring is equidistant from each sideline and from the end line. The basket ring has a net attached below to briefly check the ball&#x27;s downward progress and indicate a score. The ring is fastened to a rectangular backboard wide by tall, though in lower levels of play or recreational use the backboard may be smaller and/or fan-shaped. The entire structure is supported from behind and anchored to the floor beyond the end line at higher levels of play; the structure may be anchored to a wall or ceiling at lower levels of play. The ring, net, and the front, top, bottom, and sides of the backboard are all considered inbounds, while the back of the backboard and the support structure – even those parts suspended over inbounds areas of the court – are considered out of bounds.

====Gaelic football and Ladies&#x27; football====
In Gaelic football and ladies&#x27; Gaelic football a goal is scored when the ball passes completely beyond the goal line, between the goal posts and under the cross bar. The ball can be played with the hands, but a goal cannot be scored by hand. A ball travelling between the goal posts and over the cross bar is awarded one pointed called an &quot;over&quot;. Overs are the most common scoring method with goals heavily defended. A goal is worth three points.

====Hurling and camogie====

In hurling and camogie the ball (&quot;sliotar&quot;) must pass completely beyond the goal line. The ball may be played by any legal method except by the hand of the attacker. A ball in flight &quot;may&quot; be deflected into the goal off the hand of an attacker. Hurling and Gaelic football use the same goal structure. It is a 6.4 meter wide frame with a net attached. The goal posts are at least 6 meters high, and the crossbar is 2.44 meters above the ground. A goal is scored when the ball crosses below the crossbar and a point is scored when the ball passes above it.

===Sports with goals as secondary scoring===
At each end of the field in the following games, there is both a marked scoring area and a separate goal post structure. In these games, the term &quot;goal&quot; is only used for the secondary scoring method of putting the ball through the goal post structure.

====Gridiron football====

In American and Canadian football, there is a scoring area marked at each end of the field called an end zone, and a separate goal post structure.

The primary method of scoring is a touchdown. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the end zone. A touchdown scores 6 points in both versions of the sport. The front line of the end zone is the &quot;goal line&quot;, its back line is the &quot;end line&quot;, and each corner is marked with a pylon. Each end zone in American football is about wide, while each end zone in Canadian football is about wide. Unlike other sports which require the ball/puck to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score, both Canadian and American football merely need any part of the ball to break the vertical plane of the outer edge of the goal line to count as a touchdown.

A field goal is a secondary method of scoring; it is scored when the ball is place kicked or drop kicked completely over the crossbar and between or directly over the goal posts. A field goal scores 3 points in both versions of the sport. In the American game, the now rarely used fair catch kick, if successfully made, also scores 3 points. A goal kicked during a try following a touchdown is worth one point. These are the only methods of putting the ball through the goal posts that award points to the kicking team; no points are scored if the ball is punted or thrown through the goal posts, or if the ball goes through the goal posts on a kickoff (except, in the latter case, in indoor American football, where some leagues award a single point).

In both sports, the goal structure consists of a horizontal crossbar suspended above the ground and vertical goal posts (&quot;uprights&quot;) placed apart and extending at least above the crossbar. In lower levels of play the goal posts may be placed further apart and/or not extend as far above the crossbar; for example, in high school football the posts are apart. NFL and CFL rules mandate that a ribbon be attached to the top of each goal post. Goals are centered on the field, but on different lines: in American football, they lie on the &quot;end line&quot; (far end of the end zone) and in Canadian football, on the &quot;goal line&quot; (beginning of the end zone). A retractable net may be placed behind the goal posts, well beyond the field of play, to prevent the ball from entering spectator areas.

Until the mid-1960s, the goal posts were similar in design to rugby posts, with the crossbar and uprights supported by stanchions installed directly underneath the uprights (in the shape of the letter &#x27;H&#x27;). A transitional design from this time retained the twin set of stanchions but placed them behind the crossbar. In this design, the crossbar and uprights were supported by a set of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal stanchions behind each upright. This design was last used professionally in the first Super Bowl in January 1967. The modern goal posts supported by a single &quot;goose-necked&quot; stanchion (in the shape of the letter &#x27;Y&#x27;) made their debut in the 1966 CFL playoffs and were adopted by all three professional leagues (CFL, NFL, and AFL) the following year, with many (but not all) college teams following suit in the years since. The NFL, which merged with the AFL in , had its crossbar over the goal line until .

In arena football, a field goal also scores three points, unless it is drop kicked, in which case it scores four points. The goal structure in arena football is much smaller than the outdoor game; it consists of a crossbar above the playing surface and wide; this size is also used for most other indoor leagues as well. Uniquely in arena football, the goal posts are attached to nets on either side of the crossbar which are taut to allow the ball to rebound back onto the field of play. The nets are wide and high. These nets do not represent a scoring area, but keep the ball in play and prevent it from entering the crowd.

Canadian football also offers a secondary form of goal, the rouge or single point; it is awarded if a ball enters the end zone by way of any kick (either a missed field goal or a punt) and is not returned by the opposing team; this is not offered in American football (such a play results in a touchback instead).

====Rugby football====
In both rugby codes, there is a scoring area marked at each end of the field called an in-goal area, and a separate H-shaped goal structure. The primary scoring method is a try, worth 5 points in rugby union and worth 4 points in rugby league. A try is scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area.

A goal is scored in either rugby code by place kicking or drop kicking a ball over the crossbar and between the uprights of H-shaped goalposts. The goalposts are positioned centrally on the goal line (the front line of the in-goal area). The crossbar is from the ground; the uprights are apart in rugby league and in rugby union.

In the early years of rugby, only goals counted in scoring, and a &quot;try&quot; counted only if &quot;converted&quot; into a goal. The official name &quot;goal from a try&quot; for a converted try persisted until 1979.

==Goal celebration==

Celebrating the scoring of a goal is common. It is normally performed by the goalscorer, and may involve his or her teammates, the manager or coaching staff and/or the supporters of the team. Whilst referring to the celebration of a goal in general, the term can also be applied to specific actions, such as a player removing his shirt or performing a somersault.

==Metaphor==
The expression &quot;moving the goalposts&quot;, which means to make a set of goals more difficult just as they are being met, is often used in business but is derived from association football. It is commonly used to imply bad faith on the part of those setting goals for others to meet, by arbitrarily making additional demands just as the initial ones are about to be met.

In business, the concept is more abstract, with some performance measure or target being set as a goalpost while achieving the target is often known as achieving a goal.

<text>Alba Iulia (; or &quot;Carlsburg&quot;, formerly &quot;Weißenburg&quot;; ; ) is a city that serves as the seat of Alba County in the west-central part of Romania. Located on the river Mureș in the historical region of Transylvania, it has a population of 64,227 ().

During ancient times, the site was the location of the Roman camp Apulum. Since the High Middle Ages, the city has been the seat of Transylvania&#x27;s Roman Catholic diocese. Between 1526 and 1570 it was the capital of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom from which the Principality of Transylvania emerged by the Treaty of Speyer in 1570 and it was the capital of the Principality of Transylvania until 1711. At one point it also was a center of the Eastern Orthodox Metropolitan of Transylvania with suffragan to Vad diocese. On 1 December 1918, the Union of Transylvania with Romania was declared in Alba Iulia, and Romania&#x27;s King Ferdinand I and, in 1922 Queen Marie were crowned in the Alba Iulia Orthodox Cathedral.

Alba Iulia is historically important for Romanians, Hungarians, and Transylvanian Saxons. In December 1918, Alba Iulia was officially declared &quot;Capital of the Great Union of Romania&quot;.

The city administers four villages: Bărăbanț (&quot;Borbánd&quot;), Micești (&quot;Ompolykisfalud&quot;), Oarda (&quot;Alsóváradja&quot;), and Pâclișa (&quot;Poklos&quot;).

== Names ==
During the Roman period the settlement was called Apulum (from the Dacian &quot;Apoulon&quot;, mentioned by Ptolemy). When the settlement with its Roman ruins became the seat of a dukedom in the 10th century, the population may have been Slavic. From the 9th to the 11th centuries, the settlement bore the Slavic name &quot;Bălgrad&quot; (meaning &quot;white castle&quot; or &quot;white town&quot;). The old Romanian name of the town was &quot;Bălgrad&quot;, which originated from Slavic.

The Hungarian name &quot;Gyulafehérvár&quot; is a translation of the earlier Slavic form, meaning &quot;white castle of the Gyula&quot; meaning &quot;white city of Julius&quot;. &quot;Alba&quot; is the Romanian feminine form of the word for &quot;white&quot;, and &quot;Iulia&quot; (&quot;Julius&quot;) refers to Gyula II, a mid-10th-century Hungarian warlord who was baptized in Constantinople.

Under the influence of the Hungarian form, Gyulafehérvár, the town&#x27;s Latin name eventually became &quot;Alba Julia&quot; or &quot;Alba Yulia&quot;. Its modern Romanian name, &quot;Alba Iulia&quot;, is the adoption of this that started to spread in Romanian in ordinary speech in the 18th century. The modern name has been officially used since the town became part of Romania.

The 16th-century German name was &quot;Weyssenburg&quot;. The Saxons later renamed the town to &quot;Karlsburg&quot; (Carlsburg) in honour of Charles VI (1685–1740). In Yiddish and Hebrew, &quot;Karlsburg&quot; was prevalent. In Ladino, &quot;Carlosburg&quot; was used. &quot;Alba Carolina&quot; was also a Medieval Latin form of its name.

Among Ruthenians, the city was known as &quot;Bilhorod&quot; (&quot;white city&quot;).

The city&#x27;s Latin name in the 10th century was &quot;Civitas Alba in Ereel&quot;. The first part of the name &quot;Alba&quot; denotes the ruins of the Roman fort &quot;Apulum&quot;, the pre-feudal white citadel. Later in the Middle Ages, different names were used: &quot;Frank episcopus Belleggradienesis&quot; in 1071, &quot;Albae Civitatis&quot; in 1134, &quot;Belegrada&quot; in 1153, &quot;Albensis Ultrasilvanus&quot; in 1177, &quot;eccl. Micahelis&quot; in 1199, &quot;Albe Transilvane&quot; in 1200, &quot;Albe Transsilvane&quot; in 1201, &quot;castrum Albens&quot; in 1206, &quot;canonicis Albensibus&quot; in 1213, &quot;Albensis eccl. Transsylvane&quot; in 1219, &quot;B. Michaelis arch. Transsilv.&quot; in 1231, &quot;Alba... Civitas&quot; in 1242, &quot;Alba sedes eptus&quot; in 1245, &quot;Alba Jula&quot; in 1291, &quot;Feyrvar&quot; in 1572, &quot;Feyérvár&quot; in 1574, &quot;Weissenburg&quot; in 1576, Belugrad in 1579, &quot;Gyula Feyervár&quot; in 1619, &quot;Gyula Fehérvár&quot; in 1690 and &quot;Karlsburg&quot; in 1715.

==History==
===Ancient times===
The modern city is located near the site of the important Dacian political, economic and social centre of &quot;Apulon&quot;, which was mentioned by the ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy and believed by some archaeologists to be the Dacian fortifications on top of Piatra Craivii. After Dacia became a province of the Roman Empire, the capital of Dacia Apulensis was established here, and the city was known as &quot;Apulum&quot;. Apulum was the largest urban centre in Roman Dacia and was the seat of the XIII Gemina Legion. Apulum is the largest castrum located in Romania, occupying (750 x 500 m2).

===Middle Ages===

Analysis of the necropoles of the city prior to the 11th century show that they were used by a population different from the conquering Hungarians. Archaeological evidence shows Bulgarian presence in the 9th century.

The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; mentions a Hungarian regent named Jula or Geulathe maternal grandfather of Stephen I of Hungary and lord [regent] of Transylvaniawho built the capital of his dukedom there during the 10th century. Geula was baptized in the Byzantine Empire and built around 950 in Alba Iulia the first church of Transylvania. The ruins of a church were discovered in 2011. According to Ioan Aurel Pop and other historians, here lived Hierotheos the first bishop of Transylvania, who accompanied Geula back to Hungary after Geula had been baptized in Constantinople around 950.

After Stephen I adopted Catholicism, and the establishment of the Catholic Transylvanian bishopric, recent archaeological discoveries suggest that the first cathedral was built in the 11th century or possibly before. The present Catholic cathedral was built in the 12th or 13th century. In 1442, John Hunyadi, Voivode of Transylvania, used the citadel to prepare for a major battle against the Ottoman Turks. The cathedral was enlarged during his reign and he was entombed there after his death.

===Ottoman and Habsburg period===
In 1542 — after the partition of the Kingdom of Hungary — Alba Iulia became the capital of Transylvania and some of its neighboring territories to the west (later known as Partium), the autonomous Principality of Transylvania, and remained so until 1690. The Treaty of Weissenburg was signed in the town in 1551. During the reign of Prince Gábor Bethlen, the city reached a high point in its cultural history with the establishment of an academy. The former Ottoman Turkish equivalent was &quot;Erdel Belgradı&quot; or &quot;Belgrad-ı Erdel&quot; (&quot;Belgrade of Transylvania&quot; in English) where Erdel (Erdély) was added to prevent confusion with Belgrade and Arnavut Belgradı (&quot;Albanian Belgrade&quot; in Turkish, early name of Berat during Ottoman rule).

In 29 November 1599, Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, entered Alba Iulia following his victory in the Battle of Șelimbăr and became Voivode of Transylvania. In 1600 he gained control of Moldavia, uniting the principalities of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania under his rule, which lasted for a year and a half until he was murdered in 1601, by General Giorgio Basta&#x27;s agents.

Alba Iulia became part of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1690. The fortress &quot;Alba Carolina&quot;, designed by architect Giovanni Morando Visconti, was built between 1716 and 1735, at the behest of Emperor Charles VI of Habsburg. The leaders of the Transylvanian peasant rebellion were executed in Alba Iulia in January 1785. Important milestones in the city&#x27;s development include the creation of the Batthyaneum Library in 1780 and the arrival of the railway in the 19th century.

===20th and 21st centuries===
At the end of World War I, representatives of the Romanian population of Transylvania, the National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary, gathered in Alba Iulia on 1 December 1918 during the so-called Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia to proclaim the Union of Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania. The representatives of the Transylvanian Saxons decided to join this declaration on 8 January 1919.

In 1922, Ferdinand I of Romania was symbolically crowned King of Romania in Alba Iulia. In October 2012, at the 90th anniversary of King Ferdinand&#x27;s coronation, his great-granddaughter Princess Margarita of Romania visited Alba Iulia to commemorate the event.

===Jewish history===
The Jewish community, which was the first in Transylvania, was established in the 14th century. A community was officially founded by permission of Prince Gabriel Bethlen in 1623. The 18th century saw an influx of Ashkenazim from Hungary and Wallachia, as well as Sephardim. From 1754 to 1868, the town rabbi was the chief rabbi of Transylvania. A synagogue was built in 1840, with a Sephardic one following in 1874. Most local Jews in the 19th century worked in viticulture and bought land for growing vines; in the 20th century, they were mainly artisans. By 1930, the 1558 Jews of Alba Iulia represented nearly 13% of the town&#x27;s population.

In October 1940, during the National Legionary State, the Iron Guard terrorized local Jews. The following year, the Ion Antonescu regime confiscated Jewish property and sent the men to forced labor. After World War II, the community was re-established but soon dwindled as Jews emigrated.

==Climate==
Alba Iulia has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

The main historical area of Alba Iulia is the Upper Town region, developed by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, in honour of whom the Habsburgs renamed the city Karlsburg. The fortress, with seven bastions in a stellar shape, was constructed between 1716 and 1735 by two Swiss fortification architects. The first was Giovanni Morandi Visconti, who built two old Italian-style bastions. The second was Nicolaus Doxat de Demoretnicknamed &quot;Austrian Vauban&quot;. After 1720, the two architects radically transformed the medieval fortress shaped by the former Roman castrum into a seven-bastion baroque fortress, developing Menno van Coehorn&#x27;s new Dutch system, of which the fortress of Alba Iulia is the best preserved example.

Inside the fortress are The Union Hall with the National Honour Gallery, The National History Museum of Unification, the Princely Palace (Voivodal Palace), the Orthodox cathedral, the Roman Catholic cathedral, the Batthyaneum Library, the Roman Catholic bishop&#x27;s palace, the Apor Palace, and the University of Alba Iulia. Built in the 10th and 11th centuries, the Roman Catholic cathedral is the most representative building in the medieval Romanic style in Transylvania, and is considered to be an important monument of early Transylvanian medieval architecture. The tombs of John Hunyadi and Isabella JagiełłoQueen of Hungary are located there.

The Batthyaneum Library is held in a former church built in Baroque style. In 1780, Ignác Batthyány, bishop of Transylvania, adapted the inside of the building for use as a library. It is famous for its series of manuscripts, incunabula and rare bookssuch as half of the 9th century Codex Aureus of Lorsch, the 15th century Codex Burgundus and the 13th century Biblia Sacra (13th century). The first astronomical observatory in Transylvania was founded here in 1792. The Apor Palace, situated on the same street as the Bathyaneum Library, belonged to Prince Apor and was built in the second half of the 17th century. At the beginning of the 18th century, it was the residence of the Austrian army leader Prince Steinville. The palace was renovated in 2007 under the supervision of the Romanian Ministry of Culture.

The Orthodox Unification Cathedral was built between 1921 and 1923, following the plans of architect D.G. Ștefănescu and built under the supervision of eng. T. Eremia. The frescoes were painted by Constantin in a traditional iconographic style. The first monarchs of the Unified Romania, King Ferdinand I and Queen Marie were crowned in the cathedral on 15 October 1922.

The National Museum of Unification in Alba Iulia is located in the &quot;Babylon&quot; Building. It was built between 1851 and 1853 for military purposes and became a museum in 1887. The museum exhibits over 130,000 pieces of artworks, organized chronologically. The Unification Hall, also part of the National History Museum, retains historical significance from having hosted, on 1 December 1918, the rally of the 1228 Romanian delegations from Transylvania who determined the province&#x27;s union with the Kingdom of Romania. The building was used in 1895 as a military casino.

The Princely Palace (Palatul Principilor or Palatul Voievodal) was Michael the Brave&#x27;s residence during the first political unification of the Romanians in 1600. Foreign chronicles pictured it as an extremely luxurious building, richly adorned with frescos and marble stairs, which later deteriorated. During the rule of Princes Gábor Bethlen and George II Rákóczi the second palace was restored, but not to its previous condition.

<text>The Northern Star Award, formerly known as the Lou Marsh Trophy, the Lou Marsh Memorial Trophy and Lou Marsh Award, is a trophy awarded annually to Canada&#x27;s top athlete, professional or amateur. It is awarded by a panel of journalists, with the vote taking place in December. It was first awarded in 1936, named in honour of Lou Marsh, a prominent Canadian athlete, referee, and former sports editor of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. The trophy is made of black marble and stands around 75 centimetres high. The words &quot;With Pick and Shovel&quot; (the name of Marsh&#x27;s long-running &quot;Star&quot; column) appear above the engraved names of the winners. The voting panel consists of sports media voters from across the country including representatives from the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, &quot;The Canadian Press&quot;, FAN590, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, CBC, Rogers Sportsnet, CTV/TSN, &quot;La Presse&quot; and the &quot;National Post&quot;.

The award has been awarded 80 times and won by 63 individual athletes and three pairs; in the voting for the 2018 Lou Marsh Trophy, it was decided in the future pairs should not be eligible for the trophy, thereby disqualifying Tessa Virtue / Scott Moir from consideration. Wayne Gretzky won the trophy four times, more than any other athlete, while Barbara Ann Scott won the trophy three times, more than any other woman. It was not awarded from 1942 to 1944 due to World War II.

There were ties between different athletes in 1978 and 2020 with soccer player Alphonso Davies &amp; American football player Laurent Duvernay-Tardif as the most recent co-winners. In 1982, Rick Hansen was the auxiliary award of special merit winner (he won nine gold medals at the Pan-American Wheelchair Games) alongside first-time winner Wayne Gretzky, &quot;who was the unanimous choice of the selection committee&quot;.

On November 16, 2022, it was announced the award would be renamed from the Lou Marsh Award to the Northern Star Award &quot;after concerns were raised about racist language used by Marsh, who died in 1936, during his years of sportswriting.&quot;

==Winners==



;Key
* * = Also won the Lionel Conacher Award as Canadian male athlete of the year
* ^ = Also won the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award as Canadian female athlete of the year

==Winners by sport==
Not included in this table are Terry Fox and Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, as their respective wins were based on their social contributions, rather than their participation in a sport in general. Fox was awarded for the &quot;Marathon of Hope&quot;; Duvernay-Tardif was awarded for opting out of playing in the 2020 NFL season for the Kansas City Chiefs after winning Super Bowl LIV to work as an orderly at a long-term care facility during the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec.

<text>ITV Choice (formerly Granada UKTV, Granada TV and ITV Granada) was a television channel owned and operated by ITV plc.

==History==

The channel was launched in 1997 by Granada Media under the name Granada UKTV, and offered cable and satellite services in Middle East, Malta and Asia. It was also carried by Sky Network Television in New Zealand between 1999 and 2002.

The service was expanded and relaunched as Granada TV during 2008, when ITV announced plans to offer the channel to cable and satellite operators in Asia.

On 1 November 2010, it was rebranded as ITV Granada. The channel was renamed again as ITV Choice on 25 March 2013.

On 20 August 2019, it suddenly ceased broadcasting in many markets across the Middle East, Malta and Asia, while transmission in South Africa was unaffected. On 18 March 2020, it was announced that the channel would cease broadcasting in Africa on 4 June of that year. &quot;Tipping Point&quot; was the last programme to be broadcast on the channel before closure in Africa.

In December 2022, an ITV Choice branded FAST channel was launched on the Samsung TV Plus platform in Australia in December 2022, which airs various ITV Studios-owned programmes. In October 2023, it was renamed as Entertain by ITV Studios.

==Programming==
It primarily carried ITV and other UK programming, produced by ITV Studios and other independent production companies. Key programmes include &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot;, &quot;Doc Martin&quot;, &quot;The Chase&quot;, &quot;Tipping Point&quot;, among others.

<text>Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville (; 12 September 1777 – 1 May 1850) was a French zoologist and anatomist.

==Life==
Blainville was born at Arques, near Dieppe. As a young man, he went to Paris to study art, but ultimately devoted himself to natural history. He attracted the attention of Georges Cuvier, for whom he occasionally substituted as lecturer at the Collège de France and at the Athenaeum Club, London. In 1812, he was aided by Cuvier in acquiring the position of assistant professor of anatomy and zoology in the Faculty of Sciences at Paris. Eventually, relations between the two men soured, a situation that ended in open enmity.

In 1819, Blainville was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. In 1825, he was admitted a member of the French Academy of Sciences; and in 1830, he was appointed to succeed Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in the chair of natural history at the museum. Two years later, on the death of Cuvier, he obtained the chair of comparative anatomy, of which he proved himself a worthy successor to his former teacher. 
In 1837, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. On May 1, 1850, he died from an attack of apoplexy in a railway carriage at the Embarcadère du Havre (current Gare Saint-Lazare) in Paris.

He was the taxonomic authority of numerous zoological species, extinct and extant; including the eponymous Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale, &quot;Mesoplodon densirostris&quot;.

In the field of herpetology, he adopted Pierre André Latreille&#x27;s proposal of separating Amphibia from Reptilia, and then (1816) developed a unique arrangement in regards to sub-groupings, using organs of generation as primary criteria. He described several new species of reptiles.

Blainville rejected evolution. He was a critic of Lamarck&#x27;s evolutionary ideas but similar to Lamarck proposed a great chain of being.

It was in 1822 that he coined the term paleontology.

== Taxon named in his honor ==
Blainville is commemorated in the scientific names of several species, such as the 
*North American lizard &quot;Phrynosoma blainvillii&quot;. 
*The fossil actinopterygian fish &quot;Aeduella blainvillei&quot; from the Permian period of Europe.
*The deep-bodied pipefish (&quot;Leptonotus blainvilleanus&quot;) is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Syngnathidae.
*The La Plata river dolphin &quot;Pontoporia blainvillei&quot;.

<text>Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich (; – 25 July 1991) was a Soviet politician and one of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s closest associates.

Born to a Jewish family in Ukraine, Kaganovich worked as a shoemaker and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1911. During and after the 1917 October Revolution, he held leading positions in Bolshevik organizations in Belarus and Russia, and helped consolidate Soviet rule in Turkestan. In 1922, Stalin placed Kaganovich in charge of an organizational department of the Communist Party, assisting the former in consolidating his grip on the party. Kaganovich was appointed First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine in 1925, and a full member of the Politburo and Stalin&#x27;s deputy party secretary in 1930. In 1932–33, he helped enforce grain quotas in Ukraine which contributed to the Holodomor famine. From the mid-1930s on, Kaganovich variously served as the People&#x27;s Commissar for Railways, Heavy Industry and Oil Industry, and during the Second World War was appointed a member of the State Defence Committee.

After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 and the rise of Nikita Khrushchev, Kaganovich quickly lost his influence. After joining in a failed coup against Khrushchev in 1957, Kaganovich was dismissed from the Presidium and demoted to the director of a small potash works in the Urals. He was expelled from the party in 1961 and lived out his life as a pensioner in Moscow. At his death in 1991, he was the last surviving Old Bolshevik. The Soviet Union itself outlasted him by only five months, dissolving on 26 December 1991.

==Early life==
Kaganovich was born in 1893 to Jewish parents
in the village of Kabany, Radomyshl uyezd, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire (today Dibrova, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine). Although not from a &quot;fanatically observant&quot; family, according to Kaganovich, he spoke Yiddish at home. He was the son of Moisei Benovich Kaganovich (1863–1923) and Genya Iosifovna Dubinskaya (1860–1933). Of the 13 children born to the family, 6 died in infancy. Lazar had four elder brothers, all of whom became members of the Bolshevik party. Several of Lazar&#x27;s brothers ended up occupying positions of varying significance in the Soviet government. Mikhail Kaganovich (1888–1941) served as People&#x27;s Commissar of Defence Industry before being appointed Head of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of the Aviation Industry of the USSR, while Yuli Kaganovich (1892–1962) became the 3rd First Secretary of the Gorky Regional Committee of the CPSU. Israel Kaganovich (1884–1973) was made the head of the Main Directorate for Cattle Harvesting of the Ministry of Meat and Dairy Industry. However, Aron Moiseevich Kaganovich (1888–1960s) apparently decided against following his siblings into government, and did not pursue a career in politics. Lazar also had a sister, Rachel Moiseevna Kaganovich (1883–1926), who married Mordechai Ber Lantzman; they lived together in Chernobyl for a period, but she subsequently died in the 1920s and was interred in Kiev.

Lazar Kaganovich left school at 14, to work in shoe factories and cobblers&#x27; shops. Around 1911, he joined the Bolshevik party (his older brother Mikhail Kaganovich had become a member in 1905). Early in his political career, in 1915, Kaganovich became a Communist organizer at a shoe factory where he worked. During the same year he was arrested and sent back to Kabany.

==Revolution and Civil War==
During March and April 1917, he served as the Chairman of the Tanners Union and as the vice-chairman of the Yuzovka Soviet. In May 1917, he became the leader of the military organization of Bolsheviks in Saratov, and in August 1917, he became the leader of the &quot;Polessky Committee&quot; of the Bolshevik party in Belarus. During the October Revolution of 1917 he led the revolt in Gomel.

In 1918 Kaganovich acted as Commissar of the propaganda department of the Red Army. From May 1918 to August 1919 he was the Chairman of the Ispolkom (Committee) of the Nizhny Novgorod Governorate. In 1919–1920, he served as governor of the Voronezh Governorate. The years 1920 to 1922 he spent in Turkmenistan as one of the leaders of the Bolshevik struggle against local Muslim rebels (&quot;basmachi&quot;), and also commanding the succeeding punitive expeditions against local opposition.

==Communist functionary==
In June 1922, two months after Stalin became the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Kaganovich was appointed head of the party&#x27;s Organisation and Instruction Department (&quot;Orgotdel&quot;), which was expanded a year later by absorbing the Records and Assignment Department, and renamed the Organisation-Assignment Department (&quot;Orgraspred&quot;). This department was responsible for all assignments within the apparatus of the Communist Party. Working there, Kaganovich helped to place Stalin&#x27;s supporters in important jobs within the Communist Party bureaucracy. In this position he became noted for his great work capacity and for his personal loyalty to Stalin. He stated publicly that he would execute absolutely any order from Stalin, which at that time was a novelty.

In May 1924, Kaganovich became a full member of the Central Committee, after having first been elected as a candidate one year earlier, a member of the Orgburo, and a Secretary of the Central Committee.

From 1925 to 1928, Kaganovich was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian SSR. In July 1926, he was also elected a candidate member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was given the task of &quot;ukrainizatsiya&quot; – meaning at that time the building up of Ukrainian communist popular cadres, and encouraging &#x27;low&#x27; Ukrainian culture, by removing bureaucratic obstacles to the use of the Ukrainian language; but he treated high culture with great suspicion. He was particularly suspicious of the poet, Mykola Khvylovy, and sent Stalin a selection of quotations from Khvylovy&#x27;s verses, which incited Stalin to launch an attack on the poet. He clashed frequently with the two most prominent ethnic Ukrainian Bolsheviks Vlas Chubar and Alexander Shumsky. Shumsky obtained an audience with Stalin in 1926 to insist that Kaganovich be recalled, but Kaganovich succeeded in getting Shumsky dismissed the following year, over his support for Khvylovy. Later, Stalin had a similar visit from Chubar, and the Ukraine President, Grigory Petrovsky. In 1928, Stalin reluctantly agreed to recall Kaganovich.

In Moscow, he returned to his position as a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, a job he held until 1939. As Secretary, he endorsed Stalin&#x27;s struggle against the so-called Left and Right oppositions within the Communist Party, and backed Stalin&#x27;s decision to enforce rapid collectivisation of agriculture, against the more moderate policy of Nikolai Bukharin, who argued in favor of the &quot;peaceful integration of kulaks into socialism.&quot; In summer 1930, he was warned that Lenin&#x27;s widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya had delivered a speech at a district party branch in Moscow, in which she criticised collectivisation. Kaganovich rushed to the meeting, and subjected Krupskaya to &quot;coarse and scathing abuse.&quot;

In July 1930, Kaganovich was promoted to full membership of the Politburo, which he retained for 27 years.

== Stalin&#x27;s deputy ==
In December 1930, when Vyacheslav Molotov promoted to the post of chairman of the Soviet government, Kaganovich replaced him as Stalin&#x27;s deputy in the party secretariat, a position he held until February 1935. In these four years, he was the third most powerful figure in the Soviet leadership, behind Stalin and Molotov. He was left in Moscow in charge of party affairs when Stalin was on vacation. In 2001, a collection of 836 letters and telegrams that Stalin and Kaganovich exchanged in 1931–36 were published in Russia. The bulk of them were translated and published in the US in 2003.

In 1933 and 1934, he served as the Chairman of the Commission for Vetting of the Party Membership (&quot;Tsentralnaya komissiya po proverke partiynykh ryadov&quot;) and ensured personally that nobody associated with anti-Stalin opposition would be permitted to remain a Communist Party member. In 1934, at the XVII Congress of the Communist Party, Kaganovich chaired the Counting Committee. He falsified voting for positions in the Central Committee, deleting 290 votes opposing the Stalin candidacy. His actions resulted in Stalin&#x27;s being re-elected as the General Secretary instead of Sergey Kirov. By the rules, the candidate receiving fewer opposing votes should become the General Secretary. Before Kaganovich&#x27;s falsification, Stalin received 292 opposing votes and Kirov only three. However, the &quot;official&quot; result (due to the interference of Kaganovich) saw Stalin with just two opposing votes.

In 1930–35, he was also First Secretary of the Moscow Obkom of the Communist Party (1930–1935). He later headed the Moscow Gorkom of the Communist Party (1931–1934). During this period, he also supervised destruction of many of the city&#x27;s oldest monuments, including the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. In 1932, he led the suppression of the workers&#x27; strike in Ivanovo-Voznesensk.

=== Moscow Metro ===
In the 1930s, Kaganovich – along with project managers Ivan Kuznetsov and, later Isaac Segal – organized and led the building of the first Soviet underground rapid-transport system, the Moscow Metro, known as &quot;Metropoliten imeni L.M. Kaganovicha&quot; after him until 1955. The decision to construct the metro was made at a plenum of the Central Committee on June 15, 1931, after a report by Kaganovich.

On October 15, 1941, L. M. Kaganovich received an order to close the Moscow Metro, and within three hours to prepare proposals for its destruction, as a strategically important object. The metro was supposed to be destroyed, and the remaining cars and equipment removed. On the morning of October 16, 1941, on the day of the panic in Moscow, the metro was not opened for the first time. It was the only day in the history of the Moscow metro when it did not work. By evening, the order to destroy the metro was canceled.

In 1955, after the death of Stalin, the Moscow Metro was renamed to no longer include Kaganovich&#x27;s name.

==Responsibility for the 1932–1933 famine==

In July 1932, Molotov and Kaganovich travelled to Kharkov, then the capital of Ukraine, to order the Politburo of the Ukrainian Communist party to set a quote of grain procurement of 356 million pood a year. Every member of the Ukrainian Poliburo pleaded for a reduction in the quantity of grain peasants were required to hand over to the state, but Kaganovich and Molotov &quot;categorically refused&quot;. Later the same month, they sent the Ukrainian party leaders a secret telegram ordering them to intensify grain production and impose harsh penalties on peasants who failed to comply. In August, Stalin and Kaganovich pushed through a decree that made theft or sabotage of state property, including the property of collective farms, punishable by death, and Kaganovich sent a telegram to the Ukrainian leaders on &quot;the unsatisfactory pace of grain procurement.&quot; On 13 January 2010, Years later, when the Kyiv Court of Appeal had investigated the causes of the 1932–33 famine, known as the Holodomor, the court cited these four incidents as proof that Kaganovich was complicit in an act of genocide against the Ukrainian nation. Though he and others were pronounced guilty as criminals, the case was ended immediately according to paragraph 8 of Article 6 of the Criminal Procedural Code of Ukraine. The court&#x27;s ruling also referred to Kaganovich&#x27;s return visit to Kharkiv in December 1932, when, during a Politburo session that lasted until 4.00 am, Ukrainians present begged that peasants should be allowed to retain more grain for their own consumption and seeds for the next year&#x27;s crop, but Kaganovich overruled them and messaged Stalin accusing them of &quot;seriously hampering and undermining the entire grain procurement.&quot;

Kaganovich also travelled to the Northern Caucasus in October 1932 to &quot;struggle with the class enemy who sabotaged the grain collection and sowing.&quot; Meeting resistance from Cossacks, he had the entire population of 16 Cossack villages, of more than 1,000 people each, deported, and brought in peasants from less fertile land to replace them.

He also traveled to the central regions of the USSR, and Siberia demanding the acceleration of collectivization and repressions against the Kulaks, who were generally blamed for the slow progress of collectivization.

=== Repression of Poltavskaya ===
Poltavskaya sabotaged and resisted collectivization period of the Soviet Union more than any other area in the Kuban which was perceived by Lazar Kaganovich to be connected to Ukrainian nationalist and Cossack conspiracy. Kaganovich relentlessly pursued the policy of requisition of grain in Poltavskaya and the rest of the Kuban and personally oversaw the purging of local leaders and Cossacks. Kaganovich viewed the resistance of Poltavskaya through Ukrainian lens delivering oration in a mixed Ukrainian language. To justify this Kaganovich cited a letter allegedly written by a stanitsa ataman (local Cossack leader) named Grigorii Omel&#x27;chenko advocating Cossack separatism and local reports of resistance to collectivization in association with this figure to substantiate this suspicion of the area. However Kaganocvich did not reveal in speeches throughout the region that many of those targeted by persecution in Poltavskaya had their family members and friends deported or shot including in years before the supposed Omel&#x27;chenko crisis even started. Ultimately due to being perceived as the most rebellious area almost all (or 12,000) members of the Poltavskaya stantisa were deported to the north. This coincided with and was a part of a wider deportation of 46,000 Cossacks from Kuban. At the same time, Poltavskaya was renamed Krasnoarmeyskaya ().

==&quot;Iron Lazar&quot;==

In spring 1935, Kaganovich was replaced as the secretary in charge of party organisation, and as chairman of the purge commission, by Nikolai Yezhov, the future head of the NKVD, whose rise was a harbinger of the Great Purge. Kaganovich had handpicked Yezhov in 1933 to be deputy head of the purge commission, significantly boosting his career. In March 1935, Kaganovich was replaced as first secretary of the Moscow party organisation, by Nikita Khrushchev.
From February 1935 to 1937, Kaganovich was Narkom (Minister) for the railways. This was the first step in his eventual switch from party to economic work, but in 1935, he played a significant role in preparations for the Great Purge. Even before it started, he organized the arrests of thousands of railway administrators and managers accused of sabotage.. Before the opening of the first of the Moscow show trials in August 1936, Kaganovich and Yezhov jointly reported to Stalin, who was on vacation, about progress in forcing the defendants to confess. He was also in Moscow to facilitate Yezhov&#x27;s appointment as head of the NKVD, after Stalin had demanded the sacking of the incumbent, Genrikh Yagoda, which Kaganovich praised as a &quot;remarkable and wise decision of our father.&quot;

During the Great Purge, Kaganovich was sent from Moscow to Ivanovo, the Kuban, Smolensk and elsewhere, to instigate sackings and arrests. In Ivanovo, he ordered the arrests of the provincial party secretary, and the head of the propaganda department, and accused a majority of the executive of being &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. His visit became known as the &quot;black tornado&quot;.

In all Party conferences of the later 1930s, he made speeches demanding increased efforts in the search for and prosecution of &quot;foreign spies&quot; and &quot;saboteurs.&quot; For his ruthlessness in the execution of Stalin&#x27;s orders, he was nicknamed &quot;Iron Lazar.&quot; During his time serving as Railways Commissar, Kaganovich participated in the murder of 36,000 people by signing death lists. Kaganovich had exterminated so many railwaymen that one official called to warn that one line was entirely unmanned. In 1936–39, Kaganovich&#x27;s signature appears on 188 out of 357 documented execution lists.
Kaganovich was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar for Heavy Industry after his predecessor, Sergo Ordzhonikidze committed suicide, in February 1937. In August 1938, he was named as a Deputy Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. In 1939, he was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar for the Oil Industry. During World War II (known as the Great Patriotic War in the USSR), Kaganovich was Commissar (Member of the Military Council) of the North Caucasian and Transcaucasian Fronts. During 1943–1944, he was again the Narkom for the railways. In 1943, he was presented with the title of Hero of Socialist Labour. From 1944 to 1947, Kaganovich was the Minister for Building Materials.

== Political decline ==
Politically, Kaganovich was a much diminished figure after the war. An early sign of his weakened position was that in 1941, his brother, Mikhail, committed suicide when facing arrest, just after the German invasion. Lazar Kaganovich reputedly made no attempt to help him. When the State Defence Committee was formed to direct the war, Kaganovich was initially excluded, though he was co-opted in February 1942. In 1946, he was officially ranked ninth in seniority in the Kremlin pecking order.

In 1947, after Ukraine had failed to deliver its grain quota in the wake of a drought, Kaganovich was sent to replace Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Ukrainian CP, while Khrushchev was downgraded to the post of head of government. However, Kaganovich was recalled and Khrushchev reinstated in December 1947.

From 1949, until Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953, Kaganovich was in a precarious situation because of the state-sponsored anti-semitism, culminating in the Slánský trial in Prague, and the Doctors&#x27; plot, during which hundreds of Jews, including Molotov&#x27;s wife, Polina Zhemchuzhina, were arrested, and many were tortured and shot. Kaganovich remained in office throughout, as the most prominent Jew in the Soviet leadership, but was no longer invited to meet Stalin socially, and &quot;was lying low, watching the course of events in fear and trembling&quot;.

From 1948 to 1952, he was the Chairman of Gossnab (State Committee for Material-Technical Supply, charged with the primary responsibility for the allocation of producer goods to enterprises, a critical state function in the absence of markets).

After Stalin&#x27;s death, Kaganovich appeared to regain some of the influence he had lost. In March 1953, he was appointed one of four First Vice-Premiers of the Council of Ministers, and confirmed as a full member of the ten-man Praesidium (the new name given to the Politburo), and on 24 May 1955, he was appointed the first Chairman of Goskomtrud.

But his position rapidly deteriorated with the rise of Nikita Khrushchev. In the 1930s, he had been Khrushchev&#x27;s mentor, but Khrushchev had not forgiven the interlude when Kaganovich supplanted him as the Ukrainian party leader in 1947, and had come to despise him. In his memoirs, Khrushchev wrote:

In 1956–57, Kaganovich joined Molotov, Georgy Malenkov, and Dmitri Shepilov in an attempt to remove Khrushchev from office, partly in reaction against Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech in February 1956, denouncing Stalin and the persecution of innocent party officials. On 6 June 1956, Kaganovich was removed from the chairmanship of the State Committee on Labour and Wages. When the Central Committee convened to resolve this dispute, in June 1957, Kaganovich was accused of &quot;inactivity and crude violations of revolutionary legality&quot; in his management of the state committees he chaired, and was expelled from the Praesidium, with the other three members of what was now officially called the Anti-Party Group&#x27;. He was reportedly terrified that he would be arrested and shot, and phoned Khrushchev to beg for clemency. He was given the job of director of a small potash works in the Urals.

In 1961, Kaganovich was expelled from the Party and became a pensioner living in Moscow. His grandchildren reported that after his dismissal from the Central Committee, Kaganovich (who had a reputation for his temperamental and allegedly violent nature) never shouted again and became a devoted grandfather.

In 1984, his re-admission to the Party was considered by the Politburo, alongside that of Molotov. During the last years of life he played dominoes with fellow pensioners and criticized Soviet media attacks on Stalin: &quot;First, Stalin is disowned, now, little by little, it gets to prosecute socialism, the October Revolution, and in no time they will also want to prosecute Lenin and Marx.&quot; Shortly before death he suffered a heart attack.

In 1991 Kaganovich was interviewed about the alleged murder of Lenin&#x27;s widow, in which he suggested Lavrentiy Beria may have been involved with Krupskaya&#x27;s poisoning and was quoted in 1991 saying &quot;I can&#x27;t dismiss that possibility. He might have.&quot; Russian writer Arkady Vaksberg further commented that the fact Kaganovich had confirmed the poisoning &quot;did actually take place is more important than specifying who ordered it.&quot;

Kaganovich died on July 25, 1991, at the age of 97, just before the events that resulted in the end of the USSR. He is buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

== &#x27;Rosa Kaganovich&#x27; ==

In 1987, American journalist Stuart Kahan published a book entitled &quot;The Wolf of the Kremlin: The First Biography of L.M. Kaganovich, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Architect of Fear&quot; (William Morrow &amp; Co). In the book, Kahan claimed to be Kaganovich&#x27;s long-lost nephew, and claimed to have interviewed Kaganovich personally and stated that Kaganovich admitted to being partially responsible for the death of Stalin in 1953 (supposedly by poisoning). A number of other unusual claims were made as well, including that Stalin was married to a sister of Kaganovich (supposedly named &quot;Rosa&quot;) during the last year of his life and that Kaganovich (who was raised Jewish) was the architect of anti-Jewish pogroms.

The rumor that Stalin married a sister of Kaganovich after the death of Nadezhda Alliluyeva in 1932 seems to have originated in the 1930s. Elizabeth Lermolo, who emigrated to the US in 1950 and published a memoir, &quot;Face of a Victim&quot; reported hearing the story while she was a prisoner in the gulag. The story has been repeated in sources including &quot;The Rise and Fall of Stalin&quot;, (1965) by Robert Payne, &quot;The Private Life of Josif Stalin&quot; (1962) by Jack Fishman and Bernard Hutton, and in &quot;Stalin: the History of a Dictator&quot; (1982) by Harford Montgomery Hyde. There were also frequent mentions of &#x27;Rosa Kaganovich&#x27; in western media including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;. The story of Rosa Kaganovich was mentioned by Trotsky, who alleged that &quot;Stalin married the sister of Kaganovich, thereby presenting the latter with hopes for a promising future.&quot;

After &quot;The Wolf of the Kremlin&quot; was translated into Russian by Progress Publishers, and a chapter from it printed in the &quot;Nedelya&quot; (&quot;Week&quot;) newspaper in 1991, remaining members of Kaganovich&#x27;s family composed the &quot;Statement of the Kaganovich Family&quot; in response. The statement disputed all of Kahan&#x27;s claims. The family denied that Kaganovich ever had a sister called Rosa, though he had a niece of that name, who was 13 years old in the year when Stalin&#x27;s second wife committed suicide. Stalin&#x27;s daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva was equally emphatic, writing in a memoir published in 1969:

After the fall of communism in 1991, it became possible for historians to search for evidence in the archives. There is no mention of &#x27;Rosa Kaganovich&#x27; in the hundreds of published letters and telegrams found in the archives that Stalin and Kaganovich exchanged in the period when, supposedly, they were brothers-in-law. Simon Sebag Montefiore mentioned her in his detailed study of life in the Kremlin under Stalin, but only to say that &quot;it seems this particular story is a myth.&quot; He added:

==Personal life==
Kaganovich entered the workforce at the age of 13, an event which would shape his aesthetics and preferences through adulthood. Stalin himself confided to Kaganovich that the latter had a much greater fondness and appreciation for the proletariat. As his favorability with Stalin rose, Kaganovich felt compelled to rapidly fill the noticeable gaps in his education and upbringing. Stalin, upon noticing that Kaganovich could not use commas properly, gave Kaganovich three months&#x27; leave to undertake a rapid course in grammar. 

Kaganovich was married to Maria Markovna Kaganovich (née Privorotskaya) (1894–1961), a fellow assimilated Kievan Jew who was part of the revolutionary effort since 1909. Mrs Kaganovich spent many years as a powerful municipal official, directly ordering the demolition of the Iberian Gate and Chapel and Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. The couple had two children: a daughter, named Maya, and an adopted son, Yuri. Much attention has been devoted by historians to Kaganovich&#x27;s Jewishness, and how it conflicted with Stalin&#x27;s biases. Kaganovich frequently found it necessary to allow great cruelties to occur to his family to preserve Stalin&#x27;s trust in him, such as allowing his brother to be coerced into suicide.

The Kaganovich family initially lived, as most high-level Soviet functionaries in the 1930s, a conservative lifestyle in modest conditions. This changed when Stalin entrusted the construction of the Moscow Metro to Kaganovich. The family moved into a luxurious apartment near ground zero (Sokolniki station), located at 3 Pesochniy Pereulok (Sandy Lane). Kaganovich&#x27;s apartment consisted of two floors (an extreme rarity in the USSR), a private access garage, and a designated space for butlers, security, and drivers.

<text>Nelson Slade Bond (November 23, 1908 – November 4, 2006) was an American writer. His works included books, magazine articles, and scripts used in radio, for television and on the stage.

The 1998 recipient of the Nebula Author Emeritus award for lifetime achievement, Bond was a pioneer in early science fiction and fantasy. His published fiction is mainly short stories, most of which appeared in pulp magazines in the 1930s and 1940s. Many were published in &quot;Blue Book&quot; magazine, though Bond largely retired from fiction writing after the 1950s. He is noted for his &quot;Lancelot Biggs&quot; series of stories and for his &quot;Meg the Priestess&quot; tales, which introduced one of the first powerful female characters in science fiction.

==Early life==
Bond&#x27;s parents, Richard Slade Bond and Mary Bond, were from Nova Scotia, but moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania shortly before his birth in that city. The family later relocated to Philadelphia after World War I. In high school, Bond reviewed plays for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. He worked for an insurance company during the Great Depression before enrolling in a college. He attended Marshall College in Huntington, West Virginia from 1932 to 1934. While at Marshall, he contributed to the &quot;Huntington Herald Advertiser&quot; and edited the college newspaper, &quot;The Parthenon&quot;. He met his future wife, Betty Gough Folsom, while at Marshall, and they married in 1934.

After graduating, Bond briefly worked for his father&#x27;s public relations agency. Shortly after joining, he was offered the position of public relations field director for the province of Nova Scotia. This involved meeting celebrities visiting the province and writing pieces about them that were placed in various periodicals.

He started selling fiction when he realised he could make more money by writing, sending works to newspapers, pulp magazines and the more upmarket &quot;slick&quot; magazines.

He started by writing sports stories but made his first significant sale with &quot;Mr. Mergenthwerker&#x27;s Lobblies&quot;, which was published 
in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1937. His first science fiction story was &quot;Down the Dimensions&quot; in the April 1937 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot;. He only wrote occasional non-fiction once he was established as an author of fiction. Bond wrote and sold more for &quot;Blue Book&quot; than the pulps, which was not only more prestigious but paid more for his work.

He also published articles on philately and served on the Board of Governors / Board of Directors of the British North America Philatelic Society.

==Radio and television==
Bond wrote for such radio programs as &quot;Dr. Christian&quot;, &quot;Hot Copy&quot; (1941–44) and &quot;The Sheriff&quot; (1944–51), a continuation of &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;. Bond also scripted for numerous television anthology programs, such as &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;General Motors Theatre&quot; and &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;. &quot;Mr. Mergenthwirker&#x27;s Lobblies&quot; was adapted to radio at least a half-dozen times and also ran as a 1938 radio series. After Bond scripted the story as a teleplay, it became the first full-length play presented on network television. It was televised three times - on &quot;Broadway Previews&quot; (1946), &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot; (1949) and the &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; (1953). For &quot;Locus&quot; Bond described his experiences in radio and TV:

I began writing for radio after they started adapting some of my stories. I thought, &quot;Well, hell, I can do better than that,&quot; and I started adapting them myself. After a while, a couple of series opened up, and they asked me to become the writer. I wrote 52 weeks of &quot;Hot Copy&quot; and about 26 weeks of &quot;The Sheriff&quot; show, a comedy Western. Then television came along. I had just written &quot;Mr. Mergenthwirker&#x27;s Lobblies&quot; as a radio series, and I adapted it for television. It became the first television play ever aired on a network. The network, however, consisted of Boston, New York and Washington. (This was 1946.) The presentation was so elaborate, there was a studio audience, and they printed a program for it. Unfortunately, no copy of the show exists, because they didn&#x27;t have tape in those days. All they had was kinescope, flickering black and white movie stuff. That was probably the golden opportunity of my life that I threw out the window. After the play was done, the director said, &quot;This is a brand-new medium. Why don&#x27;t you come up here and get into it with us?&quot; They couldn&#x27;t pay me very much, and I said, &quot;I&#x27;m making more than that in radio right now,&quot; so I turned it down... But I wrote about 15 or 20 television plays, some of them adaptations of my own things, others original. &quot;State of Mind&quot; was a fantasy about a man who got pissed off at modern civilization. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna secede from the Union.&quot; So he did. I thought it was a helluva good idea! (Still a cute play, but it&#x27;s not produced anymore.) I adapted my second Mergenthwirker/Lobblies story as a television play, and then there was a third one.

==Other writing==
Bond worked in public relations before and after his writing career, opening his own agency in 1959. He later became a noted antiquarian bookseller. Bond retired from writing in the late 1950s. After encouragement from fans and professionals, notably Harlan Ellison, he published a new story in 1995.

Bond had an extensive correspondence with James Branch Cabell and after Cabell&#x27;s death was his literary executor for a while.

In 1998 the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made Bond an Author Emeritus. In 2002 Bond donated his personal papers to the Marshall University library, which created a replica of his home office. Bond died of complications from heart problems on November 4, 2006.

Nelson and Betty Bond had two sons, Kit and Lynn. Betty Bond had her own career in Virginia television, interviewing local notables for her &quot;Betty Bond Show&quot; on Roanoke&#x27;s WSLS-TV. Bond died in Las Vegas, Nevada while visiting his son.

<doc id="400498" wikidata="Q510368" url="?curid=400498" title="Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia">
<text>Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia () was an administrative division of Nazi Germany created on 8 October 1939 from annexed territory of the Free City of Danzig, the Greater Pomeranian Voivodship (Polish Corridor), and the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; West Prussia of &quot;Gau&quot; East Prussia.

Before 2 November 1939, the Reichsgau was called Reichsgau West Prussia. Though the name resembled that of the pre-1920 Prussian province of West Prussia, the territory was not identical. Unlike the former Prussian province, the &quot;Reichsgau&quot; included the Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) region in the south and lacked the &quot;Deutsch-Krone&quot; (Wałcz) region in the west.

The province&#x27;s capital was Danzig (Gdańsk), and its population without the city was (in 1939) 1,487,452. The province&#x27;s area was 26,056 km2, 21,237 km2 of which was annexed Danzig and Pomeranian territory. During the &quot;Reichsgau&quot;&#x27;s short existence, Poles and Jews in that area were subjected by Nazi Germany to extermination as &quot;subhumans&quot;.

==History==
The Prussian province West Prussia created from Polish territory annexed by Prussia in Partitions of Poland was dissolved in 1920, following the Treaty of Versailles. The bulk of it inhabited by Polish majority became part of the newly established Second Republic of Poland and was administered as Pomeranian Voivodship (Polish Corridor). The eastern remains of German West Prussia were attached to the Province of East Prussia as Regierungsbezirk West Prussia - a &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; (&quot;government region&quot;) being a German administrative subunit of a province (&quot;Provinz&quot;) comprising several counties (&quot;Kreise&quot;). The western remains of German West Prussia were merged to the German remains of the former Province of Posen and made a new province, Posen-West Prussia.

After the Nazis came to power in Germany, they reformed the administrative system by transforming the former German provinces and states into their Gau system in 1935 as a part of their Gleichschaltung policy.

In 1938, German Posen-West Prussia was dissolved and its former West Prussian territory was attached to the German Pomeranian Gau. Also in 1938, the Polish Pomeranian Voivodship was expanded southward to comprise the Bydgoszcz region. The resulting enlarged Pomeranian voivodeship was called Greater Pomeranian Voivodship (&quot;Wielkopomorskie&quot;).

When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, this Greater Pomeranian voivodship was first made the German military district &quot;West Prussia&quot;, and by a decree of Adolf Hitler on 8 October merged with the Free City of Danzig and the East Prussian Regierungsbezirk West Prussia, to form the &quot;Reichsgau&quot; West Prussia. The western remains remained outside and continued to be administered by the German Pomeranian Gau as Regierungsbezirk Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia according to the 1938 reform, while the Bromberg (Bydogoszcz) region stayed with &quot;Reichsgau&quot; West Prussia and was not attached to &quot;Reichsgau&quot; Posen, the later &quot;Warthegau&quot;. The designation &quot;Reichsgau&quot; instead of just &quot;Gau&quot; indicates that the province primarily consisted of annexed territory. A &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of a &quot;Reichsgau&quot; was also titled &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot;. Other &quot;Reichsgau&quot;e were e.g. Reichsgau Wartheland and Reichsgau Sudetenland.

The Free City of Danzig comprised the Nazi Party&#x27;s Gau Danzig which had been established in March 1926. The &quot;Gauleiters&quot; of Gau Danzig were:

Hans Albert Hohnfeldt (March 1926 - June 1928)
Walter Maass, Acting (August 1928 - March 1929)
Erich Koch, Acting (March 1929 - September 1930)
Arthur Greiser, Acting (October 1930), and
Albert Forster (from 15 October 1930)

On 1 September 1939 at the start of the war, Germany immediately annexed the Free City of Danzig. Following the establishment of the new Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia on 8 October, Forster was named &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; of the expanded territory on 26 October.

==Population==
The Reichsgau was very heterogenous, like the territory, which comprised territory of the pre-war Danzig (completely), of Germany (West Prussia Government Region) and of Poland (roughly the Pomeranian Voivodeship), the population amounted to 2,179,000 altogether, with 1,494,000 Polish citizens of mostly Polish ethnicity, 408,000 Danzig citizens of mostly German ethnicity and 277,000 German citizens of mostly German ethnicity. The German occupiers considered the Danzig and Polish citizenships as naught, due to the de facto abolition of these two states. Christian Danzigers and Christian Poles of German ethnicity were granted German citizenship, Jewish Danzigers, and Jewish Poles of which ethnicity so ever were denied the German citizenship. As to Christian Danzigers and Christian Poles of Polish ethnicity the acceptance as citizens was mostly denied, but under certain circumstances granted.

===Extermination and expulsion of ethnic Poles and Jews by Nazi Germany===

Nazi German policy aimed at extermination of Jewish and Polish population. Mass-murder sites in the region include:
*Stutthof concentration camp, where over 85,000 died (mostly Poles);
*Piaśnica, where some 12,000 local Polish-Kashub intelligentsia and others were murdered.

Nazi policy to exterminate the Polish and Jewish populations was conducted in several phases; the first stage occurred in September 1939. The main Nazi responsible for genocide conducted in the Pomeranian Voivodeship was Gauleiter Albert Forster, who was involved in the mass murder and ethnic cleansing of Jews and ethnic Poles and enlisted to his program, often under threat of violence, Polish citizens—descendants of Germanic settlers—whom the Nazis saw as Germans. Forster declared that Poles must be eradicated: &quot;We must exterminate this nation, starting from the cradle.&quot;

The Reichsgau was the site of the Stutthof concentration camp and its sub camps where over 85,000 people were executed or died of illness, starvation or mistreatment. Of the 52,000 Jews who were sent to the camp only around 3,000 would survive.

During the Winter of 1939/40 between 12,000 and 16,000 people were murdered at Piaśnica by Einsatzkommando 16, units of the 36th Regiment of SS, and members of the Selbstschutz, a militia force made up of Poles of German ethnicity. The local Selbstschutz, under the command of Ludolf von Alvensleben, numbered 17,667 and before their disbandment in October 1939 had killed 4,247 people.

Commander of the &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; Ludolf von Alvensleben told his men on 16 October 1939:
Jews did not figure prominently among the victims in West Prussia, as the area&#x27;s Jewish population was small and most had fled before the Germans arrived. However, in places where they were present, they were expelled and murdered in what was classified as &quot;other measures&quot; which simply meant murder. In areas where Jewish families or individuals remained, a &quot;shameful situation&quot; was proclaimed, and Nazi authorities expected the Selbstschutz to remedy it through &quot;direct action&quot;. In August 1943 around 500 Jews from a camp in the Pomeranian Voivodeship were sent to Auschwitz, out of which 434 were immediately killed upon arrival 

It is estimated that, by war&#x27;s end, up to 60,000 people had been murdered in the region, and up to 170,000 expelled. though other estimates place the figure at around 35,000. Forster himself reported that, by February 1940, 87,000 people had been &quot;evacuated&quot; from the region.


==Administration==
Danzig-West Prussia was divided into three government regions (Regierungsbezirk), with the name-giving capital cities of Bromberg, Danzig and Marienwerder.

In 1939 the Free City of Danzig was annexed to Germany. After a brief transitional period, its territory became part of the restored Regierungsbezirk Danzig in the Reichsgau Danzig-Westpreussen (the restored Prussian Province of West Prussia) and was divided into nine districts (Kreise):

*Kreis Berent
*Danzig-Land (Rural) 
*Danzig-Stadt City 
*Dirschau 
*Elbing-Land (Rural) 
*Grosses Werder 
*Karthaus
*Neustadt
*Zoppot City County (detached from Neustadt)

Regierungsbezirk Danzig
Governing Presidents/Regierungspräsidenten:
*1940–1943 – Fritz Hermann
*1943–1945 – Albert Forster

The NSDAP gauleiter of Danzig, Albert Forster, became leader of Civil Administration in Danzig in 1939, as well as Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter of the Reichsgau. He remained the most powerful politician throughout the war, until the area was overrun by the Soviet forces in March 1945.

The Wehrmacht established there the Wehrkreis XX, based at Danzig, under the command of 
*General der Artillerie Walter Heitz (11 Sep 1939 - 23 Oct 1939) (as &quot;Befehlshaber Danzig-Westpreußen&quot;)
*General der Infanterie Max Bock (23 Oct 1939 - 30 Apr 1943) 
*General der Infanterie Bodewin Keitel (30 Apr 1943 - 30 Nov 1944) 
*General der Infanterie Karl-Wilhelm Specht (1 Dec 1944 - ? Jan 1945)

==Polish resistance==
The Polish resistance movement was active in the region, both in the pre-war Polish and German-controlled parts of the region, with activities including secret Polish schooling, printing and distribution of Polish underground press, sabotage actions, espionage of German activity, smuggling data on German persecution of Poles and Jews and on German V-weapons to Western Europe and facilitating escapes of endangered Polish resistance members and Polish, British, French and Russian prisoners of war who fled from German POW camps via the port cities to neutral Sweden. In 1943, local Poles managed to save some kidnapped Polish children from the Zamość region, by buying them from the Germans during transport through the region. The Gestapo cracked down on the Polish resistance several times, with the Poles either killed or sent to prisons of concentration camps.

==Post-war==
In March 1945, the region was reclaimed by Poland, and the Nazi governor, Albert Forster, was later sentenced to death and executed for crimes against humanity. The German population (including wartime settlers, Nazis, and military officials) either fled or was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

<text>The Doctor of Education (EdD or DEd; Latin &quot;Educationis Doctor&quot; or &quot;Doctor Educationis&quot;) is (depending on region and university) a research or professional doctoral degree that focuses on the field of education. It prepares the holder for academic, research, administrative, clinical, or professional positions in educational, civil, private organizations, or public institutions. Considerable differences exist in structure, content and aims between regions.

==History ==
The history and roots of the EdD were in the United States. Other countries or regions have adopted or developed the award, often following different conventions and with different structures. This section, therefore, concerns the United States; for some other regions, information can be found under the regional headings below. 

When research universities were established in the late 19th century in the United States, they primarily awarded doctorates in the sciences and later the arts. By the early 20th century, these universities began to offer doctoral degrees in professional fields. The first professional degrees were awarded in medicine and law. Shortly thereafter, in response to the societal demand for expert practitioners, doctorates began to be awarded in education. The first Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in the field of education was granted at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1893. The first Doctor of Education (EdD) degree was granted at Harvard University in 1921. Henry Holmes, an educator at Harvard College, raised funds to establish the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Holmes saw value in increasing Harvard&#x27;s role in the professional training of educators and established doctorate of education, or Ed.D., for students who had had a successful teaching experience, possessed a &quot;working knowledge of biology, psychology, and the social sciences&quot;, and who sought a higher position within the school system. The program of study comprised five areas of education plus the study of social theory in education, history of education, and educational psychology. The dissertation served to teach the student to conduct an independent investigation utilizing existing knowledge and producing a &quot;constructive result of importance and value&quot;. The purpose of the Ed.D. was to offer a rigorous course of study that would enhance candidates’ prior knowledge and skills and better prepare them to lead as school practitioners.

The EdD degree was then added by Teachers College in 1934. Between 1925 and 1940 many institutions, including the University of California-Berkeley, Stanford University, and the University of Michigan followed the steps of Columbia and Harvard and established schools and colleges of education that offered graduate study and eventually, the two doctoral degrees. Despite this growth, however, these and other schools of education struggled to establish their identity as professional schools and were perpetually engulfed in debate over the purpose of the Ed.D.

The history of the Ed.D. throughout the 20th century was one of confusion. In many graduate schools of education it was a practitioner degree, while in others it was considered education&#x27;s research doctorate. Several factors contributed to the confusion: First, offering two doctoral degrees resulted in constant conflict between the &quot;demands of theory and those of practice&quot;. Second, the advancement of professional training was further complicated as schools of education competed with schools of arts and sciences. Graduate programs in arts and sciences were older and more established. Traditionally arts and science faculty offered doctoral preparation in the form of the Ph.D. Both the school of arts and sciences and its faculty had difficulty relinquishing their expertise in doctoral studies or in acknowledging the need for a professional doctorate degree. Third, from the inception of both doctoral degrees in education, unclear goals and similar programmatic content have confused the degree purposes and plagued professionalization efforts.

The EdD is awarded in several countries (see below).

==Australia==
In Australia, entry requirements for the EdD are similar to the PhD except that the former requires a number of years professional experience in education or academia.

==Canada==
In Canada, the Ed.D. tends to be granted by faculties of education at Universities and is a terminal degree in education. Much like the United States and Great Britain, some universities offer the EdD (Simon Fraser University), while others offer a PhD in education (McGill University, Queen&#x27;s University, University of Toronto, University of Manitoba, University of New Brunswick), and still others offer both (Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, The University of Western Ontario, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of British Columbia). 

Much like the UK, in Canada, the Ed.D. is a full academic doctorate that can only be granted by AUCC-accredited institutions and shares equal parity with a Ph.D. (Education). The dissertation to be completed as part of an Ed.D. program differs only in focus but not in breadth of study, nor academic rigour required. Ed.D. programs in Canadian institutions must include an original contribution to knowledge which must be chaired (supervised) by an accomplished researcher and orally defended (viva) to internal and external examiners. In many cases, the only salient difference between the Ph.D. and Ed.D. relates to the professional field of practice of the candidate as Ed.D. programs often tend to focus on existing pedagogical problems.

==India==
PhD in education — a doctorate in philosophy — can be done in any university recognized by U.G.C. If you have cleared NET (Education) exam then you have to choose a Guide enlisted by the university. On other hand if you do not pass NET exam then you have to qualify Exam conducted twice by every university. The NET cleared students of same university are given preference over those not qualified in NET. You have to submit the synopsis within one year of your enrollment as candidate and you must complete coursework from university recognized center followed by written exam. The rules like Non plagiarism and APA formatting are followed strictly.

==Ireland==
In Ireland, EdD programs have only recently been introduced. They tend to follow the UK model of initial research modules followed by longer research papers and thesis.

==Singapore==
In Singapore, the National Institute of Education (Nanyang Technological University) is the sole university that awards the EdD degree. The EdD programme has the rigour and expectations of a PhD, but with a professional focus.

==South Africa==
In South Africa, following a convention of using Latin in academic designations, the doctorate in education is called &quot;Doctor Educationis&quot; (DEd) and, like other doctoral degrees in that country, it is entirely a research-based qualification.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, the EdD is a terminal research degree that is equivalent to the PhD, both which can only be granted by universities with research-degree awarding powers. 

The EdD usually involves courses and a dissertation, but as with all doctorates requires at least a dissertation. The EdD thesis may be shorter than that of the PhD, because the EdD normally includes coursework that includes assessed papers, whereas PhD programs of study are focused on undertaking a thesis without such coursework. The EdD thesis differs from a PhD thesis only in length and scope but not in quality. As with PhD candidates, all EdD candidates undergo a viva voce examination (comprehensive oral defence of one&#x27;s thesis/dissertation).

The EdD is generally presented as an opportunity to prepare for academic, administrative or specialised positions in education, placing the graduates for promotion and leadership responsibilities, or high-level professional positions in a range of locations in the broad Education industry. Both the EdD and PhD are recognised for the purposes of appointment as a lecturer or professor in universities.

In 1991, the Doctor of Education programme at the University of Bristol began and was the first taught doctorate outside of North America. The EdD is delivered through a balance of taught units including research methods, theory, argumentation and evaluation skills as well as a major research thesis that must make an original contribution to knowledge. As with other doctoral candidates, participants of the EdD are encouraged to publish articles and books based on their research. An excellence in doctoral level research is the main aim of the Bristol EdD.

At the Institute of Education in London, the EdD &quot;is for experienced professionals from education and related fields who would like to extend their professional understanding and develop skills in research, evaluation and high-level reflection on practice&quot;. Meanwhile, the PhD &quot;is intended to enable [students] to produce [their] own thesis and to develop a range of research and other more generic skills.&quot;

The University of Cambridge&#x27;s Faculty of Education provides a useful comparison between the PhD and EdD programmes for their particular university.

==United States==
In the United States, the EdD tends to be granted by the school of education of universities and is a terminal degree in education. Majors within the EdD may include: counseling, curriculum and instruction/curriculum and teaching, educational administration, education policy, educational psychology, educational technology, higher education, human resource development, language/linguistics, leadership or technology/innovation in instruction. The EdD is recognized for appointment as a professor or lecturer in a university. It may also be recognized as preparation for administrative positions in education and human development field, such as superintendent of schools, human resource director, or principal.

From the very beginning, there was a formal division between the EdD and the PhD in education, and the growing popularity of the applied doctorates was met by faculty in the arts and sciences questioning their legitimacy. They argued that practical and vocational aims were inappropriate for doctoral study, which they contended should be focused on producing scholarly research and college professors. The EdD and the colleges of education that granted them continued to face criticism through the 1980s. In 2013, Harvard University, the first institution to award the EdD degree, accepted its last EdD cohort and instead now offers both the Doctor of Philosophy in Education and the Doctor of Educational Leadership (EdLD) degrees.

===Comparisons of the EdD to the PhD in education in the United States===
There are similarities between the EdD and PhD which may cause confusion. In theory, the two degrees are expected to constitute overlapping but distinct categories, where the EdD is a degree that prepares educational practitioners who can solve educational problems using existing knowledge, and the PhD in education is the more theoretical of the two as a traditional social science research degree that prepares students for careers as scholars and academics, often from a particular disciplinary perspective (e.g., sociology of education). In reality, however, distinctions between the two degree programs are generally minimal in both curriculum and dissertation requirements. One study on dissertations submitted between 1950 and 1990 indicated that there were no differences between the two degrees regarding basic versus applied research or the significance of the findings. Nonetheless, that same study indicated that &quot;PhD dissertations contained more multivariate statistics, had wider generalizability, and were more prevalent in certain areas of concentration&quot;, whereas &quot;EdD dissertations contained more survey research and were most prevalent in educational administration research.&quot; The difference is attributed primarily to which type of degree a particular school offers and if existing research or original research is required in the dissertation.

The Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate (CPED) states that &quot;the professional doctorate in education prepares educators for the application of appropriate and specific practices, the generation of new knowledge, and for the stewardship of the profession.&quot; To wit, although the CPED describes the EdD as a professional doctorate, it also states that it prepares students for the generation of new knowledge, and this is corroborated by the fact that both the PhD and EdD degrees are considered research doctoral degrees on the &quot;Survey of Earned Doctorates&quot;, which is a survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, sponsored by six federal agencies, and solicited, under the National Science Foundation Act, from graduating doctoral students at all accredited institutions.

Colleges and universities in the United States that offer doctorates in education choose to offer only the Doctor &quot;of&quot; Education (e.g. Webster University), only the Doctor of Philosophy &quot;in&quot; education (e.g., Stanford University), or both (e.g., UCLA, University of Missouri, and University of Pennsylvania). The distinction between the PhD and the EdD in this last group can take different forms. At the University of Illinois, for example, the PhD in education dissertation requires an original contribution to academic knowledge, whereas the EdD dissertation &quot;is intended to demonstrate the candidate&#x27;s ability to relate academic knowledge to the problems of professional practice.&quot; At Teachers College, Columbia University the PhD is designed for students who wish specifically to pursue an academic career, whereas the EdD is designed for broader aims including educational administration and policy work. In St. Louis University&#x27;s Educational Studies program, the EdD requires &quot;successful completion of a culminating project dealing with a problem in educational practice&quot; and the PhD requires a dissertation and an &quot;oral defense of the dissertation proposal and [of] the final dissertation. Most Ed.D., Psy.D. and Ph.D. programs require a dissertation and an oral defense while others have a research project leading to publication as an alternative.&quot; Finally, some schools frame the EdD specifically in terms of applied research, such as New York University, The University of Texas at Austin, and the University of California, Berkeley.

In addition to educational settings, the EdD degree is designed to address real-world issues including clinical mental health counseling and human resource development.

===Criticism===
Lee Shulman, President of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, stated that the lack of distinction between the EdD and the PhD has meant the EdD has come to be seen as little more than &quot;Ph.D.-lite&quot;, and the PhD in education has likewise suffered. Moreover, it has resulted in &quot;the danger that we achieve rigorous preparation neither for practice nor for research.&quot; Arthur Levine, former president of Teachers College, Columbia University, said that the EdD degree is granted to both scholars and administrators and as such makes the degree ambiguously defined, that the programs in educational leadership specifically suffered from low standards, and that &quot;There is absolutely no reason why a school leader needs a doctorate.&quot; Barbara K. Townsend, Professor of Higher Education and Associate Dean for Research and Development at the University of Missouri at Columbia, suggests the doctorate of education is most frequently sought for vanity purposes and to improve one&#x27;s status, citing a 2000 survey of California school superintendents in which they identify the greatest value of the EdD as being its &quot;symbolic value (credibility and respects a basis for leadership)&quot;, further adding that there is scant research or evidence to suggest that possession of a doctorate in education improves one&#x27;s ability to be an effective administrator.

===Suggestions for reform===
Some scholars in the United States have suggested future reforms for both the EdD and PhD in education by calling for a new doctorate for the professional practice of education, which would be for principals, superintendents, policy coordinators, curriculum specialists, teacher educators, program evaluators, etc.; and the distinction between the PhD in education and the EdD would be analogous to the distinction between the PhD in biomedicine and the MD. This new degree might be called the Professional Practice Doctorate (PPD), or it might retain the old name of EdD but be severed from old associations.

Arthur Levine argued that the current EdD should be retooled into a new professional master&#x27;s degree, parallel in many ways to the Master of Business Administration (MBA).

David Imig described reforms to the EdD as including more collaborative work involving the analysis of data collected by others. Rather than generating their own data and hypothesis-testing, as PhD students would, a group of EdD students would analyze a specific pool of data from a number of different angles, each writing an individual dissertation on a specific aspect of the data which, when pooled together with the other dissertations, would combine to offer a comprehensive solution to a real-world problem.

The Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate is currently working with over 80 institutions to collaboratively redesign the EdD and &quot;to make it a stronger and more relevant degree for the advanced preparation of school practitioners and clinical faculty, academic leaders and professional staff for the nation’s schools and colleges and the learning organizations that support them&quot;.

Reforms have already been implemented at some institutions. For example, in 2013 the Harvard University Graduate School of Education enrolled its final EdD cohort. The school now offers the Doctor of Education Leadership (EdLD) and PhD in Education.

<text>Most United States presidents have kept pets while in office, or pets have been part of their families. Only James K. Polk, Andrew Johnson, and Donald Trump did not have any presidential pets while in office (however, Johnson did take care of some mice he found in his bedroom).
==History of White House pets==

The first White House dog to receive regular newspaper coverage was Warren G. Harding&#x27;s dog Laddie Boy.

Pets also featured in presidential elections. Herbert Hoover got a &quot;Belgian Police Dog&quot; (Belgian Malinois), King Tut, during his campaign and pictures of him with his new dog were sent all across the United States.

Theodore Roosevelt was known for having many pets in the White House. He had six children who owned pets including snakes, dogs, cats, a badger, birds, and guinea pigs.

In 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt was running for his fourth term when rumors surfaced that his Scottish Terrier, Fala, had accidentally been left behind when visiting the Aleutian Islands. After allegedly sending back ships to rescue his dog, Roosevelt was ridiculed and accused of spending thousands of taxpayers&#x27; dollars to retrieve his dog. At a speech following this Roosevelt said, &quot;You can criticize me, my wife and my family, but you can&#x27;t criticize my little dog. He&#x27;s Scottish and all these allegations about spending all this money have just made his little soul furious.&quot; What was later called the &quot;Fala speech&quot; reportedly helped secure reelection for Roosevelt.

Richard Nixon was accused of hiding a secret slush fund during his candidacy for vice president under Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. He gave the televised &quot;Checkers speech&quot; named after his cocker spaniel, denying he had a slush fund but admitting, &quot;there is one thing that I did get as a gift that I&#x27;m not going to give back.&quot; The gift was a black-and-white cocker spaniel, Checkers, given to his daughters. Although there had been talk of Nixon being dropped from the ticket, following his speech he received an increase in support and Mamie Eisenhower reportedly recommended he stay because he was &quot;such a warm person.&quot;

President Lyndon B. Johnson caused controversy when he was photographed lifting his beagles, named Him and Her, by their ears. Some did not understand the controversy; former president Harry S. Truman said, &quot;What the hell are the critics complaining about; that&#x27;s how you handle hounds.&quot; Him died after he was run over by the presidential limousine.

Bill Clinton moved into the White House with Socks, a tuxedo cat, who in 1991 was reported to have jumped into the arms of Chelsea Clinton after piano lessons while the Clintons were living in Little Rock, Arkansas. He was later joined in 1997 by Buddy, a Labrador Retriever, during Clinton&#x27;s second term. The two pets reportedly did not get along, with Clinton later saying &quot;I did better with the Palestinians and the Israelis than I&#x27;ve done with Socks and Buddy&quot; while Hillary Clinton said Socks &quot;despised&quot; Buddy at first sight. The two were, however, the subject of a book, &quot;Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids&#x27; Letters to the First Pets&quot; written by then First Lady Hillary Clinton and appeared as cartoons in the kids&#x27; section of the first White House website.

While George W. Bush was president, he had three dogs and a cat at the White House. Among the canines was Spot Fetcher, an English Springer Spaniel and the offspring of George H. W. Bush&#x27;s dog, Millie. This made Spotty the first animal to live in the White House under two different administrations, having been born there in 1989 and passed away there in 2004.

Barack and Michelle Obama were without pets prior to the 2008 election, but promised their daughters they could get a dog when the family moved into the White House. They selected Bo, a Portuguese Water Dog, partly due to Malia Obama&#x27;s allergies and the need for a hypoallergenic pet. The puppy was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy and was later joined by Sunny, a female of the same breed. Bo was featured in the 2010 children&#x27;s book &quot;Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters&quot;, written by President Obama with illustrations by Loren Long.

Joe and Jill Biden moved into the White House with two German Shepherds, Champ and Major. Major was the first shelter dog in the White House, while Champ returned to Washington, having joined the Biden family during Joe Biden&#x27;s tenure as vice-president. The Bidens announced the death of 13-year-old Champ on June 19, 2021. In December 2021, the Bidens announced the arrival of a pedigreed German Shepherd puppy named Commander, gifted to them by Joe Biden&#x27;s brother. Officials later told the press that Major had been rehomed to a quieter environment following a series of biting incidents. Commander also had to be rehomed after at least 25 biting incidents. The Bidens had also promised they would get a cat, and they fulfilled that promise in January 2022 by adding a two-year-old gray tabby, Willow, to the family.

==List of presidential pets==
In addition to traditional pets, this list includes some animals normally considered livestock or working animals that have a close association with presidents or their families.

In Congress, Dato is active as a member of 12 committees. He serves as vice-chairman in the Committees of Agriculture and Food, Youth and Sports Development, and Bicol Recovery and Development, making him the only first-term congressman with three vice-chairmanships. Aside from having a perfect attendance record in sessions, he has already filed numerous pro-poor bills and resolutions, including those on cheaper medicines, tax exemptions for minimum wage earners, and the use of agrarian land as collateral. He has consistently been chosen as one of the Most Outstanding Congressmen by various organizations and publications.

==Personal life==
Arroyo married banker Victoria &quot;Kakai&quot; Manotok on May 16, 2003. Their wedding sponsors included: actress-singer Sharon Cuneta, businessman Jaime Zobel de Ayala, and the House Speaker&#x27;s wife, Gina de Venecia. Former presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel V. Ramos were among the guests.

<text>Louis Pierre Vieillot (10 May 1748, Yvetot – 24 August 1830, Sotteville-lès-Rouen) was a French ornithologist.

Vieillot is the author of the first scientific descriptions and Linnaean names of a number of birds, including species he collected himself in the West Indies and North America and South American species discovered but not formally named by Félix de Azara and his translator Sonnini de Manoncourt. He was among the first ornithologists to study changes in plumage and one of the first to study live birds. At least 77 of the genera erected by Vieillot are still in use.

==Biography==
Vieillot was born in Yvetot. He represented his family&#x27;s business interests in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) on Hispaniola, but fled to the United States during the Haitian rebellions that followed the French Revolution. On Buffon&#x27;s advice, he collected material for the , the first two volumes of which were published in France beginning in 1807.

Vieillot returned to France for the last time in 1798, where the position created for him at the &quot;Bulletin des Lois&quot; left him sufficient leisure to continue his natural history studies. Following the death of Jean Baptiste Audebert, Vieillot saw the two parts of the &quot;Oiseaux dorés&quot; through to completion in 1802; his own appeared in 1806.

Vieillot&#x27;s (1816) set out a new system of ornithological classification, which he applied with slight modifications in his contributions to the (1816–1819). There was bitter rivalry between the leading ornithologists and the classification introduced by Vieillot was strongly criticized by Coenraad Temminck in a pamphlet published in 1817. In 1820, Vieillot undertook the continuation of the , commenced by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in 1790. He also published an (1823–1830).


Towards the end of his life Vieillot became blind. He was granted a government pension in his final year but died in relative poverty.

Vieillot is now considered to be the authority for the scientific names of 88 genera and 402 species. Only Carl Linnaeus, Philip Sclater, and John Gould are considered to be the authority for more species. Viellot is commemorated in the scientific names of three birds: &quot;Lybius vieilloti&quot; (Vieillot&#x27;s barbet), &quot;Coccyzus vieilloti&quot; (Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo) and &quot;Sphecotheres vieilloti&quot; (Australasian figbird).

Some believe that Leach&#x27;s Storm-petrel should be named Vieillot&#x27;s Storm-petrel since he was the first to obtain a specimen of the species and to describe it. He did this in the New Dictionary of Natural History, published in 1817. He described the type location as the shores of Picardy, &quot;se tient sur l&quot;Ocean.&quot;

<doc id="400514" wikidata="Q5287517" url="?curid=400514" title="Doctor of Musical Arts">
<text>The doctor of musical arts (DMA) is a doctoral academic degree in music. The DMA combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually music performance, music composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history, music theory, or music education. The DMA degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the master&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degrees), preparing students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers. As a terminal degree, the DMA qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in musicology, teaching, leadership, music administration or music theory typically enter a doctor of music education (DME) or PhD program, rather than a DMA program.

==Terminology==
The degree is also abbreviated as DMusA or AMusD. For the related degree doctor of music education, the abbreviation is DMusE or EMusD. For the related degree doctor of arts, the abbreviation DA is used.

==Types==
A large number of US institutions offer the DMA degree. The PhD and DME are generally considered to be more research oriented, while other doctorates may place more emphasis on practical applications and/or include a performance component. Such distinctions among degree types are not always so clear-cut, however. For instance, most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written dissertation, regardless of degree designation. The music education degree can be a DME, DMA or PhD, each comprising similar research-oriented programs. Also, music education PhD programs may include performance-oriented tracks. In composition, one may study for either the DMA or the PhD, depending on the institution. The PhD is the standard doctorate in music theory, musicology, music therapy, and ethnomusicology.

===Sacred music===
A related program is the doctor of sacred music (DSM), also s&quot;acrae musica doctor&quot; (SMD), which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music, choral conducting, and organ performance. In the past, some seminaries titled the degree doctor of church music (DCM). Liberty University offers the doctor of worship studies (DWS) and doctor of music education (DME) in church music or sacred music. Only one US institution, Claremont Graduate University still offers the DCM degree, in addition to the more typical DME and DMA. The vast majority of US seminaries have closed their music doctorate programs, but some still offer a master of arts or master of sacred music degree. A new program offered at Perkins School of Theology is the doctor of pastoral music (DPM). While more theology-based and housed within the doctor of ministry (DMin) program, admission to the degree requires applicants to hold a master of music (MMus), master of sacred music (MSM), master of church music (MCM), MA in church music or equivalent 48-semester-hour degree recognized by the National Association of Schools of Music.

== History ==
The doctor of musical arts (DMA) and doctor of music education (DME) are widely available in combination of degrees in performance (sometimes with a specialization in instrumental or voice pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. Some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title doctor of music (DM or DMus) or doctor of arts (DA) or Doctor in Musical Studies (PhD) instead of DMA. The DMA degree was pioneered by Howard Hanson and the National Association of Schools of Music, who approved the first DMA programs in 1952. Northwestern University, the University of Michigan, and the Eastman School of Music became the first to offer the DMA. Boston University offered its first DMA program in 1955. In 2005, Boston University also expanded into online music education by launching the first online doctoral degree in music, a DMA program (along with a Master of Music program) in music education.

In 1952, after six years of deliberation, the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) approved thirty-two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work &quot;in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided.&quot; The NASM was, and still is, the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the American Council on Education. In 1952, 143 music schools had already established standards for undergraduate degrees. The national launch of DMA by institutions meeting criteria was 1953.

* Eastman School of Music (the DMA degree was approved by the State of New York Board of Regents in 1953)
* Boston University
* University of Southern California

The Director of the University of Rochester Eastman School of Music, Howard Hanson (1896–1981), who had been awarded an honorary doctorate in 1925, was one of several high-profile advocates of creating a performance-oriented doctoral degree. Hanson was the Chair of the NASM and Music Teachers National Association (MTNA) Graduate Commission. This commission recommended that the terminal performance doctoral degree be established. This recommendation included that schools desiring to offer this degree seek the Graduate Commission&#x27;s approval.

In 1953, he published a proposal for a doctor of musical arts degree, which was roundly criticized by Paul Henry Lang, professor of musicology at Columbia University.

Early doctor of musical arts degrees conferred
* 1954: Mathias &quot;Matt&quot; Higgins Doran (born 1921), University of Southern California
* 1955: Will Gay Bottje (born 1925), Eastman School of Music—some sources attribute Bottje as having been the first in the nation to earn the degree
* August 1955: Edward F. Gilday Jr., Boston University

Non-NASM institutions

The alumni of Music conservatories in the United States also seek positions at universities. The conservatories that are not affiliated with the National Association of Schools of Music began offering DMAs in the late 1960s.

* 1971: Margaret Hee-Leng Tan, Juilliard—she is the first woman to earn a DMA from Juilliard; Juilliard added the degree in 1969, the year it moved to Lincoln Center

<text>The International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES) is an interdenominational association of 180 evangelical Christian student movements worldwide, encouraging evangelism, discipleship and mission among students. The headquarters is in Oxford, England.

==History==
In United Kingdom, the Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, founded in 1879, was a founding member of the Student Christian Movement of Great Britain (SCM) in 1892. Then in 1928, students left SCM due to differences over liberal positions and founded the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship. This movement was established in Canada in 1928, Australia in 1930, and in the United States in 1941.

In 1947, the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students was founded. Representatives from Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Netherlands, Norway, France, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United States came together in Boston (USA) to strengthen evangelism, discipleship and world mission among students all over the world. 

It was present in 180 countries in 2023. 

==Programs==
Group meetings are held each week to discuss the Bible in universities. These groups are Evangelical, but not attached to any particular confession.

==Organization==
Representatives of all the member movements gather once every four years at the &quot;World Assembly&quot;, where the General Committee meets to conduct official business of the fellowship. IFES&#x27;s General Secretaries have included:
* Stacey Woods (1947–1972)
* Chua Wee Hian (1972–1991)
* Lindsay Brown (1991–2007)
* Daniel Bourdanné (2007–2019)
* Jamil (acting, 2019–2020)
* Tim Adams (2021–present)

==Publishing houses==
Christian literature distribution is also a feature of this ministry. InterVarsity Press (USA), Inter-Varsity Press (UK), &quot;Presses Bibliques Africaines&quot; (Francophone Africa), Harmat (Hungary), Andamio (Spain), and &quot;Ediciones Certeza&quot; (Latin America) are examples of regional publishing houses.

== Partnerships ==
Tyndale is a Christian publishing house, publishing Christian fiction, nonfiction, children’s books amongst others. Tyndale has supported IFES since 1967, through Tyndale House Foundation and helps establish IFES-affiliated publishing programs in other countries including Pakistan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Brazil, Uganda, India and the United States. These programs enable students to write and publish their own brochures, books and curriculums, and to serve their local campuses.

<text>Union Pacific Railway Engine No. 737 or UP 737 is a 4-4-0 &quot;American&quot; type steam locomotive. It is currently the oldest preserved Union Pacific steam locomotive. It was originally acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) in 1887.

==History==
UP 737 began its career as part of one of the largest locomotive orders on record up to that date, for use on Union Pacific passenger and freight trains. As delivered, the locomotive had a long, pointed, vertical bar wooden pilot, an oil &quot;box&quot; headlight, a &quot;diamond&quot; stack of the shallow diamond style peculiar to the Union Pacific at that period. It had steam and sand domes that appeared comparatively square in profile and lacked the common, ornate, cast-iron dome &quot;rings,&quot; a decorative molding that dressed up the appearance of such domes and that many 19th century locomotives sported. Upon entering service, the locomotive reportedly had the initials &quot;O.&amp; R.V.&quot; painted on the small panel below the windows on each side of the cab, standing for the name of a Union Pacific subsidiary in Nebraska, the Omaha and Republican Valley Railway. Later the locomotive had &quot;Union Pacific&quot; spelled out in small letters on each side of the cab, probably in white, and a large white &quot;737&quot; on each side of its black tender.
In August 1904 (different sources disagree on the date), the Union Pacific Railroad sold Locomotive No. 737 and a few similar 4-4-0s to either Charles Morgan&#x27;s Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company or the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, both of them components of the Southern Pacific System. A Union Pacific Railroad folio locomotive diagram book issued in 1911 showed engines of this class as having had their diamond stacks replaced with straight or &quot;shotgun&quot; stacks, but whether that change had been made before the sale of Locomotive No. 737 is not known.

Locomotive No. 737 and some of her sisters migrated southward about 1904 to the Texas and Louisiana lines of the Southern Pacific Railroad, such as the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway, the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, and Morgan&#x27;s Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company. According to one source, No. 737 became No. 246, lettered &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Louisiana and Texas.&quot; Other sources suggest that it became a Texas and New Orleans Railroad locomotive. The Southern Pacific Company owned or controlled both of these Texas-Louisiana railroads, but the question of which subsidiary owned No. 246 is not unimportant, because it would have determined how the locomotive was lettered. In 1913, in a renumbering and reorganization of motive power, the Southern Pacific Company gave the locomotive its final number: No. 246 became No. 216. At the time, the locomotive probably was lettered &quot;Southern Pacific Lines&quot; in large white letters on her tender, with the number on the cab and the small initials to indicate the actual Southern Pacific subsidiary that owned her.
During the first quarter of the 20th century, the owning railroads made a number of important modifications to Engine 246, later 216. By the end of 1904, subsequent to Congress passing a safety act that mandated the change, the Southern Pacific converted the locomotive&#x27;s link and pin coupling equipment to automatic &quot;knuckle&quot; couplers, possibly of the Janney type. At unknown dates, a number of other changes followed as the locomotive experienced further modernizations quite common on railroads across the country during that time. Mechanics and boilermakers replaced the original short smokebox with an extended smokebox with shotgun stack. It was almost certainly on the Southern Pacific Lines that the shops converted the locomotive from a coal burner to an oil burner. An oil tank was installed in the tender in place of the coal bin and hoses and pipes to feed oil to the firebox were rigged, with suitable controls and probably modification of the firebox grates. Thus the locomotive could exploit Texas and Louisiana petroleum for fuel. A steel pipe or &quot;boiler tube&quot; pilot replaced the original wooden type of cowcatcher. An all-steel cab replaced the original Baldwin wooden cab. A new and different headlight replaced the old kerosene &quot;box&quot; headlight.

Locomotive No. 216 was retired on December 4, 1929 retired from active service on a major railroad system when it was sold by Southern Pacific Company to Erath Sugar for industrial use in the cane fields of Louisiana. In August 1947, Erath Sugar transferred ownership of No. 216 to the Vermilion Sugar Company at Abbeville, Louisiana. The Vermilion Sugar Company retired No. 216 in 1956.

===Restoration===
A New England seafood processor, F. Nelson Blount, bought the locomotive for his Steamtown, U.S.A. collection in 1957. To move the locomotive to Vermont on a flat car, it was necessary to cut off the roof of the steel cab to meet height clearance requirements, but Steamtown retained the cab roof, and moved it to Bellows Falls, Vermont. It was relocated in 1984 to the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad&#x27;s Scranton Yards at Scranton, Pennsylvania under the auspices of the Steamtown Foundation.

In 1970, Steamtown began an ill-conceived attempt to cosmetically restore the engine. A replica box headlight was installed, and a wooden cab was built overtop of the existing steel cab. Most significantly, a diamond stack replica was installed on the engine. This diamond stack was much shorter than the one the engine originally carried, and was of a different design from the original. Thus, the restored 737 bore little resemblance not only to its original form, but any form it had assumed during its service life.

On October 30, 1986 the U.S. Congress passed legislation creating Steamtown National Historic Site as a unit of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior. The newly created Park is located in the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad yards in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1989, the Steamtown Foundation donated the remaining railroad collection, including UP 737, to the National Park Service. The National Park Service removed this locomotive from its property listings in August 1995 when it was donated to the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum at Boulder City, Nevada. The NSRM loaned the 737 to the Western Pacific Railroad Museum in Portola, who later acquired full ownership of the engine.

In 2004, the WPRRM traded the UP 737 to the Double-T Agricultural Museum in Stevinson, CA, where presently remains on static display. The engine was cosmetically restored to its 1914 appearance as Southern Pacific 216, with the straight, shotgun style smokestack, as well as the electric headlight and restored steel cab.

<doc id="400531" wikidata="Q358754" url="?curid=400531" title="Edward Blyth">
<text>Edward Blyth (23 December 1810 – 27 December 1873) was an English zoologist who worked for most of his life in India as a curator of zoology at the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta.

He set about updating the museum&#x27;s catalogues, publishing a &quot;Catalogue of the Birds of the Asiatic Society&quot; in 1849. He was prevented from doing much fieldwork himself, but received and described bird specimens from A.O. Hume, Samuel Tickell, Robert Swinhoe among others. His &quot;Natural History of the Cranes&quot; was published posthumously in 1881.

==Early life and work==
On 23 December 1810, Blyth was born in London. His father, a clothier, died in 1820 and his mother sent him to Dr. Fennell&#x27;s school in Wimbledon. He took an interest in reading, but was often to be found spending time in the woods nearby. Leaving school in 1825, he went to study chemistry, at the suggestion of Dr. Fennell, in London under Dr. Keating at St. Paul&#x27;s Churchyard. He did not find the teaching satisfactory and began to work as a pharmacist in Tooting, but quit in 1837 to try his luck as an author and editor. In 1836, he produced an annotated edition of Gilbert White&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Selborne&quot; which was reprinted in 1858.

He was offered the position of curator at the museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1841. He was so poor that he needed an advance of 100 pounds to make the trip to Calcutta. In India, Blyth was poorly paid (the Asiatic Society did not expect to find a European curator for the salary that they could offer), with a salary of 300 pounds per year (which was unchanged for twenty years), and a house allowance of 4 pounds per month. He married in 1854, and tried to supplement his income by writing under a pseudonym (&quot;Zoophilus&quot;) for the &quot;Indian Sporting Review,&quot; and traded live animals between India and Britain to wealthy collectors in both countries. In this venture he sought the collaboration of eminent people such as Charles Darwin and John Gould, both of whom declined these offers.

Although a curator of a museum with many responsibilities, he contributed mainly to ornithology, often ignoring the rest of his work. In 1847, his employers were unhappy at his failure to produce a catalogue of the museum. Some Asiatic Society factions opposed Blyth, and he complained to Richard Owen in 1848:

He also found the ornithologist George Robert Gray, keeper at the British Museum, uncooperative in helping him with his ornithological research far away in India. He complained to the trustees of the museum but it was dismissed with several character references in favour of Gray including Charles Darwin.

Blyth&#x27;s work on ornithology led him to be recognized as the &quot;father of Indian ornithology&quot; a title later transferred to Allan Octavian Hume.
He married a widow, Mrs. Hodges (born Sutton) who had moved to India, in 1854. She however died in December 1857, a shock which led to his health deteriorating from then on.

==On natural selection==
Edward Blyth wrote three articles on variation, discussing the effects of artificial selection and describing the process in nature as restoring organisms in the wild to their archetype (rather than forming new species). However, he never actually used the term &quot;natural selection&quot;. These articles were published in &quot;The Magazine of Natural History&quot; between 1835 and 1837.

In February 1855 Charles Darwin, seeking information on variations in domesticated animals of various countries, wrote to Blyth who was &quot;much gratified to learn that a subject in which I have always felt the deepest interest has been undertaken by one so competent to treat of it in all its bearings&quot; and they corresponded on the subject. Blyth was among the first to recognise the significance of Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s paper &quot;On the Law which has regulated the introduction of Species&quot; and brought it to the notice of Darwin in a letter written in Calcutta on 8 December 1855:

:&quot;What think you of Wallace&#x27;s paper in the &quot;Ann. M. N. H.&quot; ? Good! Upon the whole! ... Wallace has, I think, put the matter well; and according to his theory, the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into &quot;species&quot;. ... A trump of a fact for friend Wallace to have hit upon!&quot;

There can be no doubt of Darwin&#x27;s regard for Edward Blyth: in the first chapter of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; he wrote &quot;Mr. Blyth, whose opinion, from his large and varied stores of knowledge, I should value more than that of almost any one, ...&quot;

In 1911, H.M. Vickers considered Blyth&#x27;s writings as an early understanding of natural selection which was noted in a 1959 paper, where Loren Eiseley claimed that &quot;the leading tenets of Darwin&#x27;s work – the struggle for existence, variation, natural selection and sexual selection – are all fully expressed in Blyth&#x27;s paper of 1835&quot;. He also cited a number of rare words, similarities of phrasing, and the use of similar examples, which he regarded as evidence of Darwin&#x27;s debt to Blyth. However, the subsequent discovery of Darwin&#x27;s notebooks has &quot;permitted the refutation of Eiseley&#x27;s claims&quot;. Eiseley argued that Blyth&#x27;s influence on Darwin &quot;begins to be discernible in the Darwin Note-book of 1836 with the curious word &#x27;inosculate&#x27;. It is a word which has never had a wide circulation, and which is not to be found in Darwin&#x27;s vocabulary before this time.&quot; This was incorrect: an 1832 letter written by Darwin commented that William Sharp Macleay &quot;never imagined such an inosculating creature&quot;. The letter preceded Blyth&#x27;s publication, and indicates that both Darwin and Blyth had independently taken the term from Macleay whose Quinarian system of classification had been popular for a time after its first publication in 1819–1820. In a mystical scheme this grouped separately created genera in &quot;osculating&quot; (kissing) circles.

Both Ernst Mayr and Cyril Darlington interpret Blyth&#x27;s view of natural selection as maintaining the type:
:&quot;Blyth&#x27;s theory was clearly one of elimination rather than selection. His principal concern is the maintenance of the perfection of the type. Blyth&#x27;s thinking is decidedly that of a natural theologian...&quot;
:&quot;What was the work of Blyth?... Blyth attempts to show how [selection and the struggle for existence] can be used to explain, not the change of species (which he was anxious to discredit) but the stability of species in which he ardently believed.&quot;

In this negative formulation, natural selection only preserves a constant and unchangeable type or essence of created form, by eliminating extreme variations or unfit individuals that deviate too far from this essence. The formulation goes back to the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles, and the theologian William Paley set out a variation on this argument in 1802, to refute (in later pages) a claim that there had been a wide range of initial creations, with less viable forms eliminated by nature to leave the modern range of species:
:&quot;The hypothesis teaches, that every possible variety of being hath, at one time or other, found its way into existence (by what cause or in what manner is not said), and that those which were badly formed, perished; but how or why those which survived should be cast, as we see that plants and animals are cast, into regular classes, the hypothesis does not explain; or rather the hypothesis is inconsistent with this phænomenon.&quot;

The way Blyth himself argued about the modification of species can be illustrated by an extract concerning the adaptations of carnivorous mammals:
:&quot;However reciprocal...may appear the relations of the preyer and the prey, a little reflection on the observed facts suffices to intimate that the relative adaptations of the former only are special, those of latter being comparatively vague and general; indicating that there having been a superabundance which might serve as nutriment, in the first instance, and which, in many cases, was unattainable by ordinary means, particular species have therefore been so organized (that is to say, modified upon some more or less general &quot;type&quot; or plan of structure,) to avail themselves of the supply.&quot;

Stephen Jay Gould writes that Eiseley erred in failing to realize that natural selection was a common idea among biologists of the time, as part of the argument for created permanency of species. It was seen as eliminating the unfit, while some other cause created well-fitted species. Darwin introduced the idea that natural selection was &quot;creative&quot; in giving direction to a process of evolutionary change in which small hereditary changes accumulate. John Wilkins indicates that Blyth considered that species had &quot;invariable distinctions&quot; establishing their integrity, and so was opposed to transmutation of species as if it occurred, &quot;we should seek in vain for those constant and invariable distinctions which are found to obtain&quot;. Darwin held the opposite view, and did not read Blyth until after formulating his own theory. In contrast to Eiseley&#x27;s claim that Blyth felt that Darwin had plagiarised the idea, Blyth remained a valued correspondent and friend of Darwin&#x27;s after the idea was published.

Blyth returned to London on 9 March 1863 to recover from ill health. He was to get a full year&#x27;s pay for this sick leave. He however had to borrow money from John Henry Gurney and continued his animal trade. 
Around 1865, he began to help Thomas C. Jerdon in the writing of the &quot;Birds of India&quot; but had a mental breakdown and had to be kept in a private asylum. He was a corresponding member of the Zoological Society and was elected an extraordinary member of the British Ornithological Union, nominated by Alfred Newton. He later took to drinking and was once held for assaulting a cab driver. He died of heart disease on 27 December 1873 and is buried in a family grave in Highgate Cemetery.

==Other works==
Although Blyth spent most of his time in the museum in India, he was aware and interested in the study of birds in life. Prior to moving to India, he conducted some experiments to examine if cuckoo eggs (or more generally foreign eggs) were detected and removed by the hosts by placing eggs of one species in the nests of others. In 1835 he wrote that he had experimentally found chaffinches to remove a foreign egg when placed in their clutch. He also suggested the idea of replacing the original clutch with another clutch but with a single foreign egg and suggested based on his own results that either the foreign eggs would be discarded or that the birds would abandon the nest. Blyth also examined the patterns of moult in various bird groups.

Blyth edited the section on &quot;Mammalia, Birds, and Reptiles&quot; in the English edition of Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; published in 1840, inserting many observations, corrections, and references of his own. His &quot;Catalogue of the mammals and birds of Burma&quot; was published posthumously in 1875.

Working in the scientific field of herpetology, from 1853 through 1863, he described over three dozen new species of reptiles and several new species of amphibians.

==Eponymous taxa==
Avian species bearing his name include Blyth&#x27;s hornbill, Blyth&#x27;s leaf warbler, Blyth&#x27;s hawk-eagle, Blyth&#x27;s olive bulbul, Blyth&#x27;s parakeet, Blyth&#x27;s frogmouth, Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler, Blyth&#x27;s rosefinch, Blyth&#x27;s shrike-babbler, Blyth&#x27;s tragopan, Blyth&#x27;s pipit, and Blyth&#x27;s kingfisher. Reptilian species and a genus bearing his name include &quot;Blythia reticulata&quot;, &quot;Eumeces blythianus&quot;, and &quot;Rhinophis blythii&quot;.

<text>The Adelaide River is a river in the Northern Territory of Australia.

==Course and features==
The river rises in the Litchfield National Park and flows generally northwards to Clarence Strait, joined by eight tributaries including the west branch of the Adelaide River, Coomalie Creek, Margaret River and Marrakai Creek, before discharging into its mouth in Adam Bay in the Clarence Strait. The river descends over its course. The catchment area of the river is .

The Adelaide River is crossed by both the Stuart Highway, adjacent to the township of Adelaide River, and the Arnhem Highway near Humpty Doo.

The Adelaide River is well known for its high concentration of saltwater crocodiles, along with other wildlife including white-bellied sea eagles, whistling kites, freshwater crocodiles, bull sharks and black flying-fox. Its lower reaches form part of the Adelaide and Mary River Floodplains Important Bird Area. Waters of this river are also home to endangered speartooth shark and critically endangered largetooth sawfish. The river also contains a notable introduced population of Siamese fighting fish. 

==History==
Indigenous Australians including the Warray and Kungarakan owned the lands among the river for millennia.

Lieutenant Fitzmaurice, under the command of John Lort Stokes, sighted the river on a boating expedition. The expedition was part of the Admiralty surveying ship HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;&#x27;s voyage in 1839, and the river was named in honour of Queen Adelaide.

<text>John Latham (27 June 1740 – 4 February 1837) was an English physician, naturalist and author. His main works were &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot; (1781–1801) and &quot;A General History of Birds&quot; (1821–1828). He was able to examine specimens of Australian birds that reached England in the final twenty years of the 18th century, and was responsible for providing English names for many of them. He named some of Australia&#x27;s most famous birds, including the emu, sulphur-crested cockatoo, wedge-tailed eagle, superb lyrebird, Australian magpie, magpie-lark, white-throated needletail and pheasant coucal. Latham has been called the &quot;grandfather&quot; of Australian ornithology. He was also the first to describe the hyacinth macaw from South America.

==Biography==
John Latham was born on 27 June 1740 at Eltham in northwest Kent. He was the eldest son of John Latham (died 1788), a surgeon, and his mother, who was a descendant of the Sothebys, in Yorkshire.

He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and then studied anatomy under William Hunter and completed his medical education in London hospitals. In 1763 at the age of 23, he began working as a physician in the village of Darenth, near Dartford in Kent. In the same year he married Ann Porter. They had four children of whom a son John (1769–1822) and a daughter Ann (1772–1835) survived childhood.

Latham retired from his medical practice aged 56 in 1796 and moved to live near his son at Romsey in Hampshire. His wife died in 1798 and Latham remarried the same year to Ann Delamott. His son who had invested in a series of inns became heavily indebted and was declared bankrupt in 1817. Latham lost much of his wealth in supporting his son. In 1819, Latham sold his house in Romsey and moved with his wife to live with his daughter&#x27;s family in Winchester. His second wife died in 1821 and in the following year his son committed suicide.

Latham died aged 96 in Winchester on 4 February 1837 and was buried in Romsey Abbey.

==Contribution to ornithology==
&quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot; (1781–1785) was Latham&#x27;s first ornithological work and contained 106 illustrations by the author. It described many new species that Latham had discovered in various museums and collections. In that work, as with Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, he did not attach importance to the names of the species that he described. Later, Latham realised that only the use of the Linnean binomial system would give him the honour of originating a species&#x27; scientific name. Thus he published &quot;Index Ornithologicus&quot; in 1790, in which he specified a binomial name for all the species he had previously described.

However, it was too late, because Johann Friedrich Gmelin had already published his own version of Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Systema Naturæ&quot;, in which he had given a scientific name to Latham&#x27;s species. Taking into account the rules of nomenclature, Gmelin&#x27;s work has priority. Nevertheless, there are around eighty bird species for which Latham&#x27;s 1790 publication is cited as the authority. They include the emu, the black swan, the hyacinth macaw, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, and the noisy friarbird.

He had a supplement to &quot;Index Ornithologicus&quot;, containing additional scientific names, published as &quot;Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici&quot; in 1801. It is the authority for around seventy species of birds, almost all of which occur only in Australasia. They include the Pacific gull, the barking owl, the noisy miner, the Australian magpie and the magpie-lark. Publication dates are important for establishing priority in naming species, and there was speculation from the 1990s that &quot;Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici&quot; had not been available until 1802, but further research showed that the 1801 publication date is probably correct, and so it is accepted as such by naming authorities.

Working from drawings, Latham appears to have had difficulty in distinguishing the different species, and he described some more than once under different names. In the case of the Australian noisy miner, he did that four times in &quot;Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici&quot;: as the chattering bee-eater (&quot;Merops garrulus&quot;), the black-headed grakle (&quot;Gracula melanocephala&quot;), the hooded bee-eater (&quot;Merops cucullatus&quot;), and the white-fronted bee-eater (&quot;Merops albifrons&quot;). This has caused some confusion in the ornithological literature as to the correct scientific name. 

Beginning in 1821, when Latham was in his eighties, he published an expanded version of his earlier work in eleven volumes, with the title &quot;A General History of Birds&quot;. The ornithologist Alfred Newton later wrote in Encyclopædia Britannica that: &quot;his defects as a compiler, which had been manifest before, rather increased with age, and the consequences were not happy.&quot;

Latham maintained a regular correspondence with Thomas Pennant, Joseph Banks, Ashton Lever and others. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1775, and also took part in the creation of the Linnean Society. In 1812, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="400543" wikidata="Q616206" url="?curid=400543" title="Red Ruthenia">
<text>Red Ruthenia, also called Red Rus″ or Red Russia, is a term used since the Middle Ages for the south-western principalities of Kievan Rus&#x27;, namely the Principality of Peremyshl and the Principality of Belz. It is closely related to the term Cherven Cities (&quot;Red Cities&quot;).

First mentioned by that name in a Polish chronicle of 1321, Red Ruthenia was the portion of Ruthenia incorporated into Poland by Casimir the Great during the 14th century. Following the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 13th century, Red Ruthenia was contested by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (the Gediminids), the Kingdom of Poland (the Piasts), the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. After the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, for about 400 years, most of Red Ruthenia became part of Poland as the Ruthenian Voivodeship.

Nowadays, the region comprises parts of western Ukraine and adjoining parts of south-eastern Poland. It has also sometimes included parts of Lesser Poland, Podolia, Right-bank Ukraine and Volhynia. Centred on Przemyśl and Belz, it has included major cities such as: Chełm, Zamość, Rzeszów, Krosno and Sanok (now all in Poland), as well as Lviv and Ternopil (now in Ukraine).

== Ethnography ==
The first known inhabitants of northern Red Ruthenia were Lendians and White Croats, while subgroups of Rusyns, such as Boykos and Lemkos, lived in the south.

Later Walddeutsche (&quot;Forest Germans&quot;), Jews, Armenians and Poles also made up part of the population. According to Marcin Bielski, although Bolesław I Chrobry settled Germans in the region to defend the borders against Hungary and Kievan Rus&#x27; the settlers became farmers. Maciej Stryjkowski described German peasants near Rzeszów, Przemyśl, Sanok, and Jarosław as good farmers. Casimir the Great settled German citizens on the borders of Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia to join the acquired territory with the rest of his kingdom. In determining the population of late medieval Poland, colonisation and Polish migration to Red Ruthenia, Spiš and Podlachia (whom the Ukrainians called &quot;Mazury&quot;—poor peasant migrants, chiefly from Mazowsze) should be considered.

During the second half of the 14th century, the Vlachs arrived from the southeastern Carpathians and quickly settled across southern Red Ruthenia. Although during the 15th century the Ruthenians gained a foothold, it was not until the 16th century that the Wallachian population in the Bieszczady Mountains and the Lower Beskids was Ruthenized. From the 14th to the 16th centuries Red Ruthenia underwent rapid urbanization, resulting in over 200 new towns built on the German model (virtually unknown before 1340, when Red Ruthenia was the independent Kingdom of Halych).

A minority of ethnic Poles have lived since the beginning of the second Millennium in northern parts of Red Ruthenia. The exonym &quot;Ruthenians&quot; usually refers to members of the Rusyn and/or Ukrainian ethnicity.

== History ==

=== 1199 to 1772 ===

During the early Middle Ages, the region was part of Kievan Rus&#x27; and, from 1199, the independent Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia.

In 1340, the Romanovichi house of princes of Galicia and Volhynia died out, causing the Galicia–Volhynia Wars (1340–1392). Casimir the Great of Poland managed to take control of Galicia in 1340, while the Grand Duchy of Lithuania obtained Volhynia. During his reign from 1333 to 1370, Casimir the Great founded several cities, urbanizing the rural province. Under Polish rule, 325 towns were founded from the 14th century to the second half of the 17th century, most during the 15th and 16th centuries (96 and 153, respectively).

In October 1372, Władysław Opolczyk was deposed as count palatine. Although he retained most of his castles and goods in Hungary, his political influence waned. As compensation, Opolczyk was made governor of Hungarian Galicia. In this new position, he contributed to the economic development of the territories entrusted to him. Although Opolczyk primarily resided in Lwów, at the end of his rule he spent more time in Halicz. The only serious conflict during his time as governor involved his approach to the Eastern Orthodox Church, which angered the local Catholic boyars.

The Polish name &quot;Ruś Czerwona&quot; (translated as &quot;Red Rus&quot;) came into use for the territory extending to the Dniester, centring on Przemyśl. The Polish region was divided into a number of voivodeships, and an era of German eastward migration and Polish settlement among the Ruthenians began. Armenians and Jews also migrated to the region. A number of castles were built at this time, and the cities of Stanisławów (Stanyslaviv in Ukrainian, now Ivano-Frankivsk) and Krystynopol (now Chervonohrad) were founded. Red Ruthenia consisted of three voivodeships: Ruthenia, whose capital was Lviv and provinces were Lviv, Halych, Sanok, Przemyśl and Chełm; Bełz, separating the provinces of Lviv and Przemyśl from the rest of the Ruthenian voivodeship; and Podolia, with its capital at Kamieniec Podolski. Since the reign of Władysław Jagiełło (d. 1434) the Przemyśl Voivodeship was called the Ruthenian Voivodeship (&quot;województwo ruskie&quot;), centring on Lwów. The Ruthenian Voivodeship consisted of five regions: Lwów, Sanok, Halicz (Halych), Przemyśl, and Chełm. The town of Halych gave its name to Galicia.

The Vlachs primarily engaged in agriculture; moving west, they established a number of villages during the 15th century. In Sanok Land were six Jewish communities, with synagogues and &quot;kahal&quot; organizations. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Jewish Communities were also autonomous in criminal law.

Ruthenia was subject to repeated Tatar and Ottoman Empire incursions during the 16th and 17th centuries and was impacted by the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648–1654), the 1654–1667 Russo-Polish War and Swedish invasions during the Deluge (1655–1660); the Swedes returned during the Great Northern War of the early 18th century. 

=== 1772 to 1918 ===
Red Ruthenia (except for Podolia) was conquered by the Austrian Empire in 1772 during the First Partition of Poland, remaining part of the empire until 1918. Between World Wars I and II, it belonged to the Second Polish Republic. The region is currently split, with its western portion in southeastern Poland (around Rzeszów, Przemyśl, Zamość and Chełm) and its eastern portion (around Lviv) in western Ukraine.

<text>The is a Japanese railway line owned and operated by the Kintetsu Railway, a private railway operator. It connects the cities of Kyoto, Uji, and Nara, and competes with the Nara Line of West Japan Railway Company (JR-West), which also connects those cities.

Many trains on the line continue to the Nara Line to Kintetsu Nara Station or the Kashihara Line via Yamato-Saidaiji Station. The line also provides the through train services with the Karasuma Line of Kyoto Municipal Subway.

==History==
The Kyoto Line was built by in November 1928 as dual track electrified at 600 V DC. The track between Kyoto Station and Horiuchi Station (present-day Kintetsu-Tambabashi Station) was placed on the site of a removed railway, which had been rerouted and is now called the JR Nara Line.

The railway provided the through services to the lines of Kintetsu (originally, Osaka Electric Tramway) from the beginning. As of September 1961, Kintetsu was the largest shareholder of Nara Electric Railway with 980,000 shares out of the company&#x27;s 1.9 million shares, while Keihan Electric Railway owned 710,000 shares. Through a deal between the two major shareholders, the shares owned by Keihan were transferred to Kintetsu in April 1962 and the company was merged into Kintetsu from October 1963.

Between 1945 and 1968, there were through services with the Keihan Main Line using crossovers at Tambabashi. The line voltage was increased to 1,500 V DC in 1969, and in 1988 through services with the Karasuma Line were introduced.

<doc id="400546" wikidata="Q427325" url="?curid=400546" title="Communist Party of Vietnam">
<text>The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) is the founding and sole legal party of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Founded in 1930 by Hồ Chí Minh, the CPV became the ruling party of North Vietnam in 1954 and then all of Vietnam after the collapse of the South Vietnamese government following the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Although it nominally exists alongside the Vietnamese Fatherland Front, it maintains a unitary government and has centralized control over the state, military, and media. The supremacy of the CPV is guaranteed by Article 4 of the national constitution. The Vietnamese public generally refer to the CPV as simply &quot;the Party&quot; () or &quot;our Party&quot; ().

The CPV is organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. The highest institution of the CPV is the party&#x27;s National Congress, which elects the Central Committee. The Central Committee is the supreme organ on party affairs in between party congresses. After a party congress, the Central Committee elects the Politburo and Secretariat, and appoints the General Secretary, the highest party office. In between sessions of the Central Committee, the Politburo is the supreme organ on party affairs. However, it can only implement decisions based on the policies which have been approved in advance by either the Central Committee or the party&#x27;s National Congress. , the 12th Politburo has 19 members.

The party is known for its advocacy of what it calls a &quot;socialist-oriented market economy&quot; and Hồ Chí Minh Thought. The CPV was aligned with the Soviet Union and its allies during the Cold War, and implemented a command economy in Vietnam, before introducing economic reforms, known as , in 1986. While continuing to nominally hold to Marxism–Leninism, most independent sources have argued that it has lost its monopolistic ideological and moral legitimacy since the introduction of a mixed economy in the late 1980s and 1990s. In recent years, the party has stopped representing a specific class, but instead the &quot;interests of the entire people&quot;, which includes entrepreneurs. The final class barrier was removed in 2006, when party members were allowed to engage in private activities. De-emphasising Marxism–Leninism, the party has placed emphasis on Vietnamese nationalism, developmentalism, and ideas from the American and French Revolutions, along with Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s personal beliefs. The CPV participates in the annual International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties.

== History ==
=== Rise to power (1925–1945) ===
The Communist Party of Vietnam traces its history back to 1925, when Hồ Chí Minh established the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League (), commonly shortened to the Youth League (). The Youth League&#x27;s goal was to end the colonial occupation of Vietnam by France. The group sought political and social objectives—national independence and the redistribution of land to working peasants. The Youth League&#x27;s purpose was to prepare the masses for a revolutionary armed struggle against the French occupation. His efforts in laying the groundwork for the party was financially supported by the Comintern.

In 1928 the headquarters of the Youth League in Canton (present-day Guangdong), China, were destroyed by the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) and the group was forced underground. This led to a national breakdown within the Youth League, which indirectly led to a split. On 17 June 1929, more than 20 delegates from cells throughout the Tonkin (northern) region held a conference in Hanoi, where they declared the dissolution of Youth League and the establishment of a new organization called the Communist Party of Indochina (). The other faction of the Youth League, based in the Cochinchina (southern) region of the country, held a conference in Saigon and declared themselves the Communist Party of Annam () in late 1929. The two parties spent the rest of 1929 engaged in polemics against one another in an attempt to gain a position of hegemony over the radical Vietnamese liberation movement. A third Vietnamese communist group which did not originate from the Youth League emerged around this time in the Annam (central) region, calling itself the Communist League of Indochina (). The Communist League of Indochina had its roots in another national liberation group which had existed in parallel with the Youth League, and saw itself as a rival to the latter.

The Communist Party of Indochina and Communist Party of Annam, together with individual members of the Communist League of Indochina, merged to form a united communist organization called the Communist Party of Vietnam (), founded by Hồ Chí Minh at a &quot;Unification Conference&quot; held in Wah Yan College in Kowloon, British Hong Kong, from 3–7 February 1930. At a later conference, per the request of the Comintern, the party changed its name to the Indochinese Communist Party (), often abbreviated as ICP. During its first five years of existence, the ICP attained a membership of about 1,500 and had a large contingent of sympathizers. Despite the group&#x27;s small size, it exerted an influence in a turbulent Vietnamese social climate. Poor harvests in 1929 and 1930 and an onerous burden of debt served to radicalize many peasants. In the industrial city of Vinh, May Day demonstrations were organized by ICP activists, which gained critical mass when the families of the semi-peasant workers joined the demonstrations to express their dissatisfaction with the economic circumstances they faced.

As three May Day marches grew into mass rallies, French colonial authorities moved in to quash what they perceived to be dangerous peasant revolts. Government forces fired upon the crowds, killing dozens and enraging the population. In response, councils were organized in villages in an effort to govern themselves locally. Repression by the colonial authorities began in the autumn of 1931; around 1,300 people were eventually killed by the French and many more were imprisoned or deported as government authority was reasserted and the ICP was effectively wiped out in the region. General Secretary Tran Phu and a number of Central Committee members were arrested or killed. Lê Hồng Phong was assigned by the Comintern to restore the movement. The party was restored in 1935, and Lê Hồng Phong was elected its general secretary. In 1936, Hà Huy Tập was appointed general secretary instead of Lê Hồng Phong, who returned to the country to restore the Central Committee. In the mid 1930s the party was forced publicly to abandon much of its opposition to French colonialism as Soviet leader Joseph Stalin cared more about strengthening a left-inclined government in France. Hồ Chí Minh was also removed from the party leadership in the early 1930s.

The French colonial apparatus in Vietnam was disrupted during World War II. The fall of France to Nazi Germany in June 1940 and the subsequent collaboration of Vichy France with the Axis powers of Germany and Japan served to delegitimize French claims of sovereignty. The European war made colonial governance from France impossible and Indochina was occupied by Japanese forces. As a result, the communists also sought the opportunity to establish a grassroots organization throughout most of the country.

At the beginning of the war, the ICP instructed its members to go into hiding in the countryside. Despite this, more than 2,000 party members, including many of its leaders, were rounded up and arrested. Party activists were particularly hard hit in the southern region of Cochinchina, where the previously strong organization was wiped out by arrests and killings. After an uprising in Cochinchina in 1940, most of the Central Committee, including Nguyễn Văn Cừ (general secretary) and Hà Huy Tập, were arrested and killed, and Lê Hồng Phong was deported to Côn Đảo and later died. A new party leadership, which included Trường Chinh, Phạm Văn Đồng, and Võ Nguyên Giáp emerged. Together with Hồ Chí Minh, these individuals would provide a unified leadership over the next four decades.

Hồ Chí Minh returned to Vietnam in February 1941 and established a military-political front known as the League for the Independence of Vietnam (), commonly known as the Viet Minh (). The Viet Minh was a broad organization that included many political parties, military groups, religious organizations and other factions who sought independence for Vietnam. The Viet Minh was heavily influenced by the leadership of the ICP. It was the most uncompromising fighting force against the Japanese occupation and gained popular recognition and legitimacy in an environment that would become a political vacuum. Despite its position as the core of the Viet Minh, the ICP remained very small throughout the war, with an estimated membership of between 2,000 and 3,000 in 1944.

===Left opposition===
The party, particularly in the south, was rivalled by other nationalist and left-wing groups, notably Trotskyist organisations. In November 1931, dissidents emerging from within the party formed the October Left Opposition () around the clandestine journal &quot;&quot; (October). These included Hồ Hữu Tường and Phan Văn Hùm who, protesting a leadership of &quot;Moscow trainees&quot;, had formed an Indochinese group within the Communist League (), the French section of the International Left Opposition, in Paris in July 1930. Once considered &quot;the theoretician of the Vietnamese contingent in Moscow&quot;, Tường was calling for a new &quot;mass-based&quot; party arising directly &quot;out of the struggle of the real struggle of the proletariat of the cities and countryside&quot;. Tường was joined in endorsing Leon Trotsky&#x27;s doctrines of &quot;proletarian internationalism&quot; and of &quot;permanent revolution&quot; by Tạ Thu Thâu of the Annamite Independence Party (). Rejecting (in the wake of the Shanghai massacre) the Comintern&#x27;s &quot;Kuomintang line&quot;, Thâu argued against a nationalist accommodation with the indigenous bourgeoisie and for immediate &quot;proletarian socialist revolution&quot;.

Recognizing the Trotskyists&#x27; relative strength in organizing Saigon&#x27;s factories and waterfront, the ICP cells in the city maintained a unique pact with the Trotskyists for four years in the mid-1930s. The two groups published a common paper, &quot;La Lutte&quot; (&quot;The Struggle&quot;), and presented joint &quot;workers&#x27; lists&quot; for Saigon municipal and colonial-council elections. After they rallied in August 1945 with other non-Communist forces demanding arms against the French, the Trotskyists were systematically hunted down and eliminated by their former party collaborators under the direction of Tran Van Giau, a fate shared by large numbers of Caodaists, independent nationalists and their families.

=== First Indochina War (1945–1954) ===
Following the August Revolution, Hồ Chí Minh became Chairman of the Provisional Government (Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) and issued a Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Although he convinced Emperor Bảo Đại to abdicate, his government was not recognized by any country. He repeatedly petitioned American President Harry S. Truman for support for Vietnamese independence, citing the Atlantic Charter, but Truman did not respond. After the successful establishment of an independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi, Vietnam was occupied by Kuomintang forces in the north and Anglo-French forces in the south.

In response to French attempts to sow disunity within the Viet Minh, the ICP was officially dissolved and was downgraded to the &quot;Institute for Studying Marxism in Indochina&quot; (). This symbolic gesture was intended to encourage unity between Vietnamese communists and non-communists in their struggle against the French and their sympathizers. In practice, the Viet Minh became the leading force in the struggle for Vietnamese independence. The ICP was ostensibly dissolved, but its core was still functioning. According to the United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), membership in the Viet Minh grew to about 400,000 members by 1950. In 1951, during the war for independence, the officially dissolved Indochinese Communist Party was officially re-established and renamed the Worker&#x27;s Party of Vietnam (), often abbreviated as the WPV. They opposed France&#x27;s granting of independence and unity to the State of Vietnam as an associated state within the French Union. The Indochinese War against French Union forces lasted until the Vietnamese victory at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ in 1954.

Vietnam was partitioned following the 1954 Geneva Conference, with the communists ruling the northern half of the country. Almost immediately, the party&#x27;s Marxist ideologues believed that their party had lost sight of its real Marxist purpose of guiding the working class in a struggle against the bourgeoisie in its efforts of national independence. By 1955, they had launched a significant campaign to promote personnel with a background in class struggle, at the cost of communists whose claims to authority were based on their leadership in the resistance against the French.

=== Vietnam War (1955–1975) ===
At the second party congress it was decided that the Communist Party would be split into three; one party for each of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. However, in an official note it said that the &quot;Vietnamese party reserves the right to supervise the activities of its brother parties in Cambodia and Laos&quot;. The Khmer People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party was established in April 1951 and the Lao People&#x27;s Party was formed four years later on 22 March 1955. The third party congress, held in Hanoi in 1960, formalized the tasks of constructing socialism in what was by then North Vietnam, or the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV), and committed the party to the &quot;liberation&quot; of South Vietnam. In the south, the United States helped establish an anti-communist state, the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), in 1955. In 1960 the DRV established a military-political front in the south called the National Liberation Front of Southern Vietnam () or NLF for short. American soldiers commonly referred to the NLF as the Viet Cong () or VC for short.

The Vietnam War (or Second Indochina War) broke out between the communists which included the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong), and the anti-communists which included the United States, the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) and their allies, such as Australia, South Korea, and Thailand. The communists received support from the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union. The war lasted from 1960 to 1975 and spilled over into Laos and Cambodia. The Cambodian Civil War broke out between the communist Khmer Rouge and GRUNK, and the pro-American Khmer Republic. The Laotian Civil War broke out between the communist Pathet Lao and the pro-American Kingdom of Laos. The Cambodian and Laotian communists received training and support from the DRV and NLF. During the war the Worker&#x27;s Party of Vietnam also established its sub-branch in the south called the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party of South Vietnam (), which aimed to lead the NLF. After the withdrawal of American troops from Indochina and the collapse of the RVN on 30 April 1975, Vietnam was unified under the leadership of the communists. At the fourth party congress in 1976, the Workers&#x27; Party of Vietnam merged with the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party of South Vietnam to create the Communist Party of Vietnam (), commonly abbreviated as CPV. The party explained that the merger and name change was made in light of the &quot;strengthened proletariat dictatorship, the development of the leadership of the working class... a worker-peasant alliance&quot;.

=== Ruling party (1976–present) ===
The fourth party congress comprised 1,008 delegates who represented 1,553,500 party members, an estimated three per cent of the Vietnamese population. A new line for socialist construction was approved at the congress, the Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1980) was approved and several amendments were made to the party&#x27;s constitution. The party&#x27;s new line emphasized building socialism domestically and supported socialist expansion internationally. The party&#x27;s economic goal was to build a strong and prosperous socialist country in 20 years. The economic goals set for the Second Five-Year Plan failed to be implemented, and a heated debate about economic reform took place between the fourth and fifth party congresses. The first was at the sixth Central Committee plenum of the fourth party congress in September 1979, but the most revealing one occurred at the tenth Central Committee plenum of the fourth party congress which lasted from 9 October to 3 November 1981. The plenum adopted a reformist line but was forced to moderate its position when several grassroot party chapters rebelled against its resolution. At the fifth party congress, held in March 1982, General Secretary Lê Duẩn said the party had to strive to reach two goals; to construct socialism and to protect Vietnam from Chinese aggression, but priority was given to socialist construction. The party leadership acknowledged the failures of the Second Five-Year Plan, claiming that their failure to grasp the economic and social conditions aggravated the country&#x27;s economic problems. The Third Five-Year Plan (1981–1985) emphasized the need to improve living conditions and the need for more industrial construction, but agriculture was given top priority. Other points were to improve the deficiencies in central planning, improve economic trade relations with the COMECON countries, Laos and Kampuchea.

While Lê Duẩn continued to believe in the goals set in the Third Five-Year Plan, leading members within the Communist Party were losing their trust in the system. It was in this mood that the 1985 price reform was introduced—market prices were introduced, which led to a sudden increase in inflation. By 1985, it became apparent that the Third Five-Year Plan had failed miserably. Attacks against the interests of the well-to-do were part of the Communist ideas of class struggle. The majority of the educated came from well-off families, and the middle and upper classes held education and abilities that were critical to the country&#x27;s prosperity, but the Communist Party&#x27;s attitude toward those groups has frequently hampered their effective use of their education and skills. As a result, Vietnam&#x27;s most pressing needs, such as the rebuilding of a shattered economy and the establishment of long-term economic development, had largely gone unfulfilled. The Communist Party&#x27;s personnel lacked the skills to tackle these issues, and the Communists&#x27; monopolization of power made it impossible for those who did have the skills to put them to use in the decade following the war&#x27;s end. Vietnam was one of the poorest countries in the world during Lê Duẩn&#x27;s rule. Lê Duẩn died on 10 July 1986, a few months before the sixth party congress. A Politburo meeting held between 25 and 30 August 1986, paved the way for more radical reforms; the new reform movement was led by Trường Chinh. At the sixth party congress, Nguyễn Văn Linh was elected the new general secretarythis was a victory for the party&#x27;s old guard reformist wing. The new leadership elected at the Congress would later launch Đổi Mới and establish the framework for the socialist-oriented market economy. The economic reforms were initiated alongside a relaxation of state censorship and freedom of expression. The Chinese Communist Party praised the CPV&#x27;s economic and political reforms, which continued into the early 2000s.

At the seventh party congress in which Nguyễn Văn Linh retired from politics, he reaffirmed the party&#x27;s and country&#x27;s commitment to socialism. Đỗ Mười succeeded Nguyễn Văn Linh as general secretary, Võ Văn Kiệt, the leading reformist communist, was appointed prime minister and Lê Đức Anh, was appointed president. In 1994, four new members were appointed to the seventh Politburo, all of whom opposed radical reform. At the June 1997 Central Committee meeting, both Lê Đức Anh and Võ Văn Kiệt confirmed their resignations to the ninth National Assembly, which was dissolved in September. Phan Văn Khải was approved as Võ Văn Kiệt&#x27;s successor, and the relatively unknown Trần Đức Lương succeeded Lê Đức Anh as president. At the fourth Central Committee plenum of the eighth party congress, Lê Khả Phiêu was elected general secretary and Đỗ Mười, Lê Đức Anh and Võ Văn Kiệt officially resigned from politics and were elected Advisory Council of the Central Committee. Nông Đức Mạnh succeeded Lê Khả Phiêu in 2001 as general secretary. Nông Đức Mạnh held the top spot until the 11th National Congress in 2011, when he was succeeded by Nguyễn Phú Trọng. Trong is seen as a conservative and closer to China. In 2021, General Secretary of the Communist Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, was re-elected for his third term in office, meaning he is Vietnam&#x27;s most powerful leader in decades.

== Organization ==
=== National Congress ===
The National Congress is the party&#x27;s highest organ, and is held once every five years. Delegates decide the direction of the party and the Government at the National Congress. The Central Committee is elected, delegates vote on policies and candidates are elected to posts within the central party leadership. After decisions taken at the National Congress are ratified, the congress is dissolved. The Central Committee implements the decisions of the National Congress during the five-year period between congresses. When the Central Committee is not in session, the Politburo implements the policies of the National Congress.

=== Central Committee ===

The Central Committee is the CPV&#x27;s most powerful institution. It delegates some of its powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo when it is not in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by Lê Duẩn, began to centralize power. This policy continued until the sixth National Congress, when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralization. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh&#x27;s reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders, causing the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. 

Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from 15.6 per cent in 1982 to 41 per cent in 2001. Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for example, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as General Secretary, the Central Committee voted against the Politburo&#x27;s motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing him from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this because most of its members had a provincial background, or were working in the provinces. These members were the first to be affected when the economy began to stagnate during Lê Khả Phiêu&#x27;s rule. The Central Committee elects the Politburo in the aftermath of the Party Congress.

==== General Secretary ====
The General Secretary of the Central Committee is the highest office within the Communist Party, is elected by the Central Committee, and can remain in post for two five-year terms. The general secretary presides over the work of the Central Committee, the Politburo, the Secretariat, is responsible for issues such as defence, security and foreign affairs, and chairs meetings with important leaders. The general secretary holds the post of Secretary of the Central Military Commission, the party&#x27;s highest military affairs organ.

==== Politburo ====

The Politburo is the highest organ of the Communist Party between Central Committee meetings, which are held twice a year. The Politburo can implement policies which have been approved by either the previous Party Congress or the Central Committee. It is the duty of the Politburo to ensure that resolutions of the Party Congress and the Central Committee are implemented nationally. It is also responsible for matters related to organization and personnel, and has the right to prepare and convene a Central Committee plenary session. The Politburo can be overruled by the Central Committee, as happened in 2001 when the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as general secretary; the Central Committee overturned the Politburo&#x27;s decision, dismissed Lê from politics, and forced the Politburo to elect a new general secretary after the ninth National Congress.

The members of the Politburo are elected and given a ranking by the Central Committee immediately after a National Party Congress. According to David Koh, the Politburo ranking from the first plenum of the 10th Central Committee onwards is based upon the number of approval votes by the Central Committee. Lê Hồng Anh, the Minister of Public Security, was ranked second in the 10th Politburo because he received the second-highest number of approval votes. Tô Huy Rứa was ranked lowest because he received the lowest approval vote of the 10th Central Committee when he stood for election to the Politburo. The 11th Politburo was elected by the Central Committee after the 11th National Congress and consists of 16 members. Decisions within the Politburo are made through collective decision-making.

Since 10th Central Committee, the duties and responsibilities of the members of the Politburo and those of the General Secretary, President, Prime Minister, the Chairman of the National Assembly and the Permanent member of the Secretariat have been specified separately.

==== Secretariat ====

The Secretariat is headed by the general secretary and decisions within it are made through collective decision-making. The Secretariat is elected and the membership size is decided by the Central Committee immediately after the National Congress. It is responsible for solving organizational problems and implementing the demands of the Central Committee. The Secretariat oversees the work of the Departments of the Central Committee. It is also responsible for inspecting and supervising the implementation of resolutions and directives on fields regarding the party on economic, social, defence, security and foreign affairs, and it is directly responsible for the coordination of a number of party bodies. The Secretariat supervises the preparation for issues raised at Politburo meetings.

==== Central Military Commission ====

The Central Military Commission is appointed by the Politburo and includes members from the military. The commission is responsible to the Central Committee and between meetings, the Politburo and the Secretariat. The Secretary of the Central Military Commission is the party&#x27;s general secretary while the post of deputy secretary is held by the Minister of National Defence. The commission can issue guidelines on military and defence policies, and has leadership in all aspects of the military. The General Political Department is subordinate to the commission.

==== Central Inspection Commission ====
The Central Inspection Commission is the party organ responsible for combating corruption, disciplining members and wrongdoing in general. It is the only organ within the party which can sentence or condemn party members. The Commission, and its chairman and deputy chairmen, are elected by the first plenum of the Central Committee after a National Party Congress. Due to the party&#x27;s policy of democratic centralism, a local inspection commission can only investigate a case if the inspection commission directly superior to it consents to the investigation.

==== Central Theoretical Council ====

The Central Theoretical Council was established on 22 October 1996 by a decision of the Central Committee. The 4th Central Theoretical Council was formed on 7 September 2016, and is currently headed by Politburo member Đinh Thế Huynh. It functions as an advisory body to the Central Committee, the Politburo and the Secretariat on conceiving and developing party theory in line with Marxism. It is responsible for studying topics put forth by the Politburo and the Secretariat, and topics set forth by its own members.

== Ideology ==
Vietnam is a socialist republic with a one-party system led by the Communist Party. The CPV espouses Marxism–Leninism and Hồ Chí Minh Thought, the ideologies of Hồ Chí Minh. The two ideologies serve as guidance for the activities of the party and state. According to the Constitution, Vietnam is in a period of transition to socialism. Marxism–Leninism was introduced to Vietnam in the 1920s and 1930s, and Vietnamese culture has been led under the banners of patriotism and Marxism–Leninism. Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s beliefs were not systematized during his life, nor did this occur quickly following his death. Trường Chinh&#x27;s 1973 biography of Hồ emphasized his revolutionary policies. The thoughts of Hồ were systematized in 1989 under the leadership of Nguyễn Văn Linh. Hồ Chí Minh Thought and Marxism–Leninism became the official ideologies of the CPV and the state in 1991. The CPV&#x27;s claim to legitimacy was retained after the collapse of communism elsewhere in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 by its commitment to the thoughts of Hồ Chí Minh, according to Sophie Quinn-Judge. According to Pierre Brocheux, the current state ideology is Hồ Chí Minh Thought, with Marxism–Leninism playing a secondary role. Some claim that Hồ Chí Minh Thought is used as a veil for a party leadership that has stopped believing in communism, but others rule this out on the basis that Hồ Chí Minh was an avid supporter of Lenin and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Still others see Hồ Chí Minh Thought as a political umbrella term whose main function is to introduce non-socialist ideas and policies without challenging socialist legality.

Marxism–Leninism has lost its ideological stronghold in Vietnamese politics since the introduction of a mixed economy in the late 1980s and 1990s. Because of the Đổi Mới reforms, the party could not base its rule on defending only the workers and the peasants, which was officially referred to as the &quot;working class-peasant alliance&quot;. In the constitution introduced in 1992, the State represented the &quot;workers, peasants and intellectuals&quot;. In recent years, the party has stopped representing a specific class, but instead the &quot;interests of the entire people&quot;, which includes entrepreneurs. The final class barrier was removed in 2006, when party members were allowed to engage in private activities. In the face of de-emphasising the role of Marxism–Leninism, the party has acquired a broader ideology, laying more emphasis on nationalism, developmentalism and becoming the protector of tradition. Minh himself stated that what originally attracted him to Communism was not its doctrines, which he did not at that time understand, but the simple fact that the Communists supported the independence of countries like Vietnam.

=== Transition to socialism ===
According to Hồ Chí Minh, before it becomes socialist, a society must evolve through national liberation and the construction of a people&#x27;s democratic regime. While national liberation is the means of taking power, the establishment of a people&#x27;s democratic regime requires the total destruction of the feudalist, colonialist and imperialist society. Only through this destruction can Vietnam transit to socialism. Lai Quoc Khanh, a journalist in the theoretical &quot;Tạp chí Cộng Sản&quot; wrote: &quot;The people&#x27;s democratic regime is an objective necessity in the development course of Vietnamese society&quot;. A people&#x27;s democratic regime, however, is not a socialist regime. For instance, in a people&#x27;s democratic regime private ownership still exists, while in a communist or socialist stage of development, ownership does not exist. Vietnamese communists consider the distribution of land during Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s early rule as an example of people&#x27;s democracy.

However, this is not the only difference. The logic is that difference in the ownership of productions lead to different modes of production. Hồ Chí Minh said that the basic economic tenets of a people&#x27;s democratic regime was state ownership of certain segments of production—considered socialist since the state belongs to the people, cooperatives, which were half-socialist in nature but would develop into fully socialist economic entities, and the personal economics of individual handicraft and peasantry, which would later develop into cooperatives, private capitalism and state capitalism, where the state shares capital with capitalists to develop the country further. Since these economic basics relied on different types of ownership, the economy of the people&#x27;s democratic regime cannot be considered socialist, hence the regime is not socialist. For example, in the socialist-oriented market economy, the state-owned sector will be the dominant sector, hence the socialist character of the economy dominates. The political platform of the second party congress held in 1951 stated: &quot;The people&#x27;s democratic revolution is neither an old-type capitalist democratic revolution nor socialist revolution, it is a new-type capitalist democratic revolution which will evolve into socialist revolution without experiencing a revolutionary civil war.&quot; To be more specific, the people&#x27;s democratic regime is a substage in capitalist development. While Hồ Chí Minh supported the position that Vietnam had entered the stage of transition to socialism in 1954, he held the belief that Vietnam was still &quot;a democratic regime in which people are the masters&quot; and not socialist. To reach the socialist stage of development, the development of the state sector was of utmost importance—the lack of which according to Hồ Chí Minh would lead to failure. The platform of the 11th National Congress held in January 2011 stated: &quot;This is a profound and thorough revolutionary process and a complicated struggle between the old and the new for qualitative changes in all aspects of social life. It is essential to undergo a long period of transition with several steps of development and several mixed social and economic structures&quot;.

According to the party&#x27;s General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng, during the transition to socialism, socialist factors of development compete with non-socialist factors, which include capitalist factors. Nguyễn said: &quot;Along with positive aspects, there will always be negative aspects and challenges that need to be considered wisely and dealt with timely and effectively. It is a difficult struggle that requires spirit, fresh vision, and creativity. The path to socialism is a process of constantly consolidating and strengthening socialist factors to make them more dominant and irreversible. Success will depend on correct policies, political spirit, leadership capacity, and the fighting strength of the Party&quot;.

=== &quot;Superiority of socialism&quot; ===


The Communist Party believes that socialism is superior to other ideologies and state systems. According to Marxism–Leninism, socialism is the second-to-last stage of socio-economic development before pure communism. To build a socialist society, communists have to imagine, outline and study society. The party believes that socialism leads to human liberation from every oppressive situation, exploitation and injustice. While the founders of Marxism–Leninism forecasted the main characteristics of a socialist society, the founders are not considered by the party to hold the whole truth. The main outline of this ideology is upheld by the party—that is, a social mode superior and more advanced:
# The highest goal of socialism is to liberate the people from every yoke of exploitation and economic slavery of the spirit, enabling comprehensive human development.
# The facilities of socialism are the forces generated by modern advanced production.
# Socialism is the gradual abolition of private property and capitalism and changes to the means of production.
# Socialism creates labour organizations and a new form labourer with high discipline and productivity.
# Socialism means the implementation of the principle of each according to his contribution.
# State socialism is a new kind of democracy, reflecting the nature of the working class and representing the interests, power and will of the working people.
# In a socialist society, the relationship between class and ethnicity will be resolved through a combination of international and class solidarity—nationalism will be replaced by internationalism.

=== Socialist-oriented market economy ===

Proponents of the socialist-oriented market economy claim that the system is neither socialist nor capitalist, but that it is &quot;socialist-oriented&quot;. The Communist Party rejects the view that a market economy has to be capitalist. According to the party, &quot;a socialist market-oriented economy is a multi-sectoral commodity economy, which operates in accordance with market mechanisms and a socialist orientation&quot;. According to Nguyễn Phú Trọng, &quot;[i]t is a new type of market economy in the history of the market economy&#x27;s development. It is a kind of economic organization which abides by market economy rules but is based on, led by, and governed by the principles and nature of socialism reflected in its three aspectsownership, organization, and distributionfor the goal of a prosperous people in a strong nation characterized by democracy, fairness, and civilization&quot;. There are multiple forms of ownership in a socialist-oriented market economy. Economic sectors operate in accordance with the law and are equal under the law in the interest of co-existence, cooperation and healthy competition. Nguyễn Phú Trọng said:

Unlike in capitalist countries, a socialist-oriented market economy does not &quot;wait for the economy to reach a high level of development before implementing social progress and fairness, nor &#x27;sacrifice&#x27; social progress and fairness to the pursuit of mere economic growth&quot;. Policies are enacted for the sole purpose of improving the people&#x27;s standard of living.

=== Role of classical Marxism ===
Classical Marxist texts still play a prominent role in the Communist Party&#x27;s ideological development. &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, is considered an &quot;immortal work&quot;. According to the party, the real value of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; is not that it can provide answers to present revolutionary problems, but the way it explains the gradual liberation of the working class and labourers. It functions as a basis for the most basic theoretical beliefs upheld by the party. According to Tô Huy Rứa, currently a member of the 11th Politburo: &quot;By participating in the process of globalization complete with its opportunities and challenges, as was predicted by Marx and Engels in the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, the Vietnamese Communist Party and people will further find guidelines for a precious world outlook and methodologies. Sustainable values of this immortal theoretical work and political platform will remain forever&quot;. Trần Bạch Đằng wrote:

=== Criticism ===
The CPV&#x27;s ideology has been criticized from the left for its supposed departure from communist principles. Critics have argued that the socialist-oriented market economy is a re-capitalized system which allows massive capitalist markets, enriches the bourgeoisie, and increases foreign direct investment, at the cost of expanding economic inequality and social unrest. Leftist dissident Bui Tin opined that &quot;the Communist Party [of Vietnam] is full of opportunists and privileged elites. The morality is lost. All is the search for dollars.&quot;

== Party-to-party relations ==
In a resolution of the 10th National Party Congress, it was decided to renovate and strengthen the party&#x27;s foreign policy. , the Central Committee&#x27;s Commission for External Relations has good relations with 222 political parties in 115 countries. According to the party, this is an &quot;important contributions to accelerating the renovation process, industrialization and modernization of Vietnam&quot;. The party does not only have foreign relations with communist parties; relations with non-communist parties have been established because their countries are economically important to Vietnam. Relations with other communist and workers&#x27; parties are very important and built on &quot;solidarity, friendship, mutual support in the struggle for socialism in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and pure internationalism of the working class&quot;. It exchanges views with such parties on theoretical and practical issues regarding socialist construction, party building and current problems. The CPV is active in international communist and workers party gatherings, such as the International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties.

The CPV currently maintains relations with over 100 communist and workers&#x27; parties. The party has emphasized the importance of relations with the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party and the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party, as all three parties are the spiritual incarnations of the Indochinese Communist Party. It also maintains good relations with the Chinese Communist Party, the Communist Party of Cuba, and the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea. The CPV sent delegations to the 8th Congress of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation in 2008, the 5th Congress of the Party of Italian Communists in 2008, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of India in 2008, the 9th Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 2008, the 18th Congress of Communist Party of Greece in 2009, the 9th Congress of the Communist Party of Denmark in 2009, the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of Spain in 2009, the 8th Congress of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist–Leninist) in 2009, the 12th Congress of the Communist Party of Brazil in 2009 and that of the Peruvian Communist Party in 2010.

The CPV maintains also friendly relations with Latin American left-wing political parties. A delegation from the CPV participated in the 22nd Meeting of Foro de São Paulo in El Salvador in June 2016.

<text>The Ruthenian Voivodeship (; ; ) was a voivodeship of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland from 1434 until the First Partition of Poland in 1772, with its center in the city of Lwów (lat. Leopolis) (modern day Lviv). Together with a number of other voivodeships of southern and eastern part of the Kingdom of Poland, it formed Lesser Poland Province. Following the Partitions of Poland, most of Ruthenian Voivodeship, except for its northeastern corner, was annexed by the Habsburg monarchy, as part of the province of Galicia. Today, the former Ruthenian Voivodeship is divided between Poland and Ukraine.

== History ==

Following the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia was divided between Poland and Lithuania. In 1349 the Polish portion was transformed into the Ruthenian domain of the Crown, while the Duchy of Volhynia was held by Prince Lubart. With the death of Casimir III the Great, the Kingdom of Poland was passed on to the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ruthenian domain was governed by Ruthenian starosta general, one of whom was Wladyslaw of Opole.

The voivodeship was created in 1434 based on the 1430 Jedlnia-Cracow Privilege () on territory that belonged to the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. Between 1349 and 1434, the territory along with the Western Podolie was known as Ruthenian Domain of the Crown and in such manner the King of Poland were titled as the Lord of Ruthenian lands. Western Podole was added to the domain in 1394. In 1434 on territory of the domain were created Ruthenian Voivodeship and Podolian Voivodeship.

In Polish sources, western outskirts of the region was called &quot;Ziemia czerwieńska&quot;, or &quot;Czerwień Land&quot;, from the name of Cherven, a town that existed there. Today there are several towns with this name, none of them related to Red Ruthenia.

This area was mentioned for the first time in 981, when Vladimir the Great of Kievan Rus&#x27; took it over on the way into Poland. In 1018 it attached to Poland and 1031 back to Kievan Rus&#x27;. For approximately 150 years it existed as the independent Principality of Galicia and Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, before being conquered by Casimir III of Poland in 1349. Since these times the name &quot;Ruś Czerwona&quot; is recorded, translated as &quot;Red Ruthenia&quot; (&quot;Czerwień&quot; means red in Slavic languages, or from the Polish village Czermno), applied to a territory extended up to Dniester River, with priority gradually transferred to Przemyśl. Since the times of Władysław II Jagiełło, the Przemyśl voivodeship was called Ruthenian Voivodeship (&quot;&quot;), with its center eventually transferred to Lwów. It consisted of five lands: Lwów, Sanok, Halych, Przemyśl, and Chełm. The territory was controlled by the Austrian Empire from 1772 to 1918, when it was known as the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.
Zygmunt Gloger, in his monumental book&quot; Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland&quot;, provides this description of the Ruthenian Voivodeship:

In the 10th and 11th centuries, Przemysl and Czerwien were the largest gords in this region. Later on, Halych emerged as the capital of the province, while the city of Lwów was founded only in 1250. In ca. 1349, King Casimir III of Poland took control over Principality of Halych. The province was governed by royal starostas, the first one of whom was a man named Jasiek Tarnowski. Most probably in final years of reign of King Władysław II Jagiełło, it was named the Ruthenian Voivodeship, as at that time the voivodes of Przemysl began calling themselves the voivodes of Rus&#x27;. Firs such voivode was Jan Mezyk of Dabrowa.

The Ruthenian Voivodeship consisted of five ziemias: those of Lwów, Przemysl, Sanok, Halych and Chelm. The two last ones had their own local authorities; furthermore, the Land of Chelm was completely separated from other Ruthenian lands by the Belz Voivodeship. Therefore, we should speak separately of four Ruthenian lands, and the Land of Chelm, whose history was much different after the Partitions of Poland (...) The lands of Lwow, Przemysl and Sanok had their sejmiks, which took place in their respective capitals. General sejmiks for these three lands were at Sadowa Wisznia, where seven deputies were elected to the Polish Sejm: two from each land, and one from the County of Zydaczow. Starostas resided at Lwów, Zhydachiv, Przemysl and Sanok. The voivodeship had six senators: the Archbishop of Lwow, the Bishop of Przemysl, the Voivode of Ruthenia, the Castellan of Lwow, and Castellans of Przemysl and Sanok (...) The city of Lwów was the seat of a separate Lesser Poland Tribunal for the voivodeships of Ruthenia, Kijow, Volhynia, Podolia, Belz, Braclaw and Czernihow (...) The County of Zydaczow, even though officially part of Lwow Land, was often regarded as a separate ziemia, with its own coat of arms, granted in 1676. In that years, Lwow Land had 618 villages and 42 towns, while County of Zydaczow had 170 villages and 9 towns.

The Land of Przemysl was divided into two counties: those of Przemysl and Przeworsk. In 1676, the County of Przemysl had 657 villages and 18 towns, while the County of Przeworsk had 221 villages and 18 towns (...) The Land of Sanok, located in the Carpathian Foothills, was not divided into counties. In 1676, it had 371 villages and 12 towns (...)

The Land of Halicz, with its own separate local government, was divided into the counties of Trembowla, Halicz and Kolomyja. It had its own sejmik at Halicz, where six deputies were elected to the Polish Sejm (two from each county), also one deputy to the Crown Tribunal and one to the Treasury Tribunal at Radom. The Land of Halicz had one senator, and starostas, who resided in Halicz, Trembowla, Kolomuja, Tlumacz, Rohatyn, Jablonow, Sniatyn, Krasnopol, and other locations. In 1676, it had 565 villages and 38 towns. 
The Land of Chelm was an enclave, separated from Ruthenian Voivodeship by Belz Voivodeship. The Bug river divided this land into two parts, and since the 10th century, Chelm was contested by Poland and Rus. In the course of the time, the Lithuanians also joined the conflict. It was ended in 1377, when King Louis annexed Chelm. The Land of Chelm had its own local offices, and a sejmik, where two deputies to the Sejm and one deputy to the Lesser Poland Tribunal were elected. It was divided into counties of Chelm and Krasnystaw, starostas resided in Chelm, Krasnystaw, Ratno, Luboml, Hrubieszow, and other locations. The Land of Chelm had two senators: the Bishop of Chelm and the Castellan of Chelm. In 1676, there were 427 villages and 23 towns in both counties (...) Southern part of the Land of Chelm belonged to the vast Zamoyski Family Fee Tail, which stretched beyond the region, into Urzedow County of Lublin Voivodeship.

<text>The Batignolles Cemetery () is a cemetery in Paris.

==History==

Batignolles Cemetery opened on 22 August 1833. Part of the cemetery had to be closed, and the graves moved because of the construction of the great ring road (Boulevard Périphérique, between the exits of Porte de Clichy and Porte de Saint-Ouen).

==Description==
Extending over nearly eleven hectares, slightly larger than the Montmartre Cemetery, Batignolles Cemetery contains approximately fifteen thousand graves, and it is the fourth cemetery &quot;intra muros&quot; of Paris, in terms of the number of graves. In terms of land area, only the Père Lachaise Cemetery and the Montparnasse Cemetery are larger. Within its perimeter, there are approximately nine hundred mature trees, mostly chestnuts and maples.
Because of the construction of apartment buildings next to the cemetery, the Avenue des Fortifications is no longer accessible (from 2009-?).

==Notable burials==

Batignolles is now the home for the earthly remains of André Barsacq, Alexandre Benois, André Breton, Alfred Bruneau, Lucienne Bréval, Gaston Calmette, Blaise Cendrars, Clémentine de Vère, Léon Dierx, Pierre Dreyfus, Marguerite Durand, Hélène Dutrieu, Jean L&#x27;Herminier, Cora Pearl, Joséphin Péladan, Benjamin Péret, Ray Ventura, Paul Vidal, Édouard Vuillard and André Zirnheld (in the family grave), among others.

Before the opening of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery the cemetery was a popular burial place for members of the Russian Orthodox community. Many are buried in the &quot;carré russe-orthodoxe&quot;, division 25. Among them Léon Bakst, Sergei Lyapunov, Pavel Milyukov and Pavel Ryabushinsky. Feodor Chaliapin was buried here but his remains were later reburied in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

The grave of Paul Verlaine was originally in division 20 but had to be moved to the roundabout (at the crossing of Avenue Principale and Avenue Transversale).

The cemetery contains one British Commonwealth war grave, that of a Royal Air Force officer of 1918.

==Location==

The cemetery is located in the Épinettes district, in the northeastern part of the 17th arrondissement. The entry to the cemetery is at the intersection of Rue Saint-Just and Avenue du Cimetière des Batignolles. The cemetery is lodged between the Boulevard Périphérique and the Lycée International Honoré de Balzac.

==Public transport==
 The Batignolles Cemetery is a short walk from the Porte de Clichy station, which can be reached by taking line 13 or the C line commuter train.
Other nearby Métro stations are Brochant, Mairie de Clichy and Porte de Saint-Ouen.

 The Batignolles Cemetery is also served by bus lines 54, 74, 138, 173, PC

There are Vélib&#x27; stations at Avenue de la Porte de Clichy (17014 and 17114) and at Boulevard Berthier (17106).

<doc id="400564" wikidata="Q332231" url="?curid=400564" title="Abseiling">
<text>Abseiling ( ; ), also known as rappelling ( ; ), is the controlled descent of a steep slope, such as a rock face, by moving down a rope. When abseiling, the person descending controls their own movement down a static or fixed rope, in contrast to lowering off, in which the rope attached to the person descending is paid out by their belayer.

==Description==

The technique is used by climbers, mountaineers, cavers, canyoners, search and rescue and rope access technicians to descend cliffs or slopes when they are too steep and/or dangerous to descend without protection. Many climbers use this technique to protect established anchors from damage. Rope access technicians also use this as a method to access difficult-to-reach areas from above for various industrial applications like maintenance, construction, inspection and welding.

To descend safely, abseilers use a variety of techniques to increase the friction on the rope to the point where it can be controlled comfortably. These techniques range from wrapping the rope around their body (e.g. the Dülfersitz technique) to using custom-built devices like a rack or a figure of 8. Practitioners choose a technique based on speed, safety, weight and other circumstantial concerns.

In the United States, the term &quot;rappelling&quot; is used. In the United Kingdom, both terms are understood, but &quot;abseiling&quot; is more common. In Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the two terms are used interchangeably. Globally, the term &quot;rappelling&quot; appears in books written in English more often than &quot;abseiling&quot;.

== History ==
Abseiling has existed, both using body abseil and descenders for centuries, with body abseiling being mentioned in the late 1400s, and descenders being described in the early 1600s.

The origin of the &quot;term&quot; rappel in reference to the technique is attributed by Mountaineering author circa 1944. Frison-Roche in turn attributed the &quot;technique&quot; of rappelling to , a Chamonix guide who lived from 1840 to 1925. However, at the time, the term rappel meant to use a doubled rope that could be pulled down afterwards, and did not necessarily refer to abseiling, and while Frison-Roche may have used a doubled rope technique, he did not use an abseiling technique devised by Charlet-Straton. Different approaches for using a doubled rope had already been described in the late 1700s and by Edward Whymper around 1860, though neither case were used with what would be considered abseiling. Charlet-Straton then used another doubled rope technique which was called the rappel during a failed solo attempt of Petit Dru in 1876. The technique he used to descend the rope would not normally be considered abseiling, and had already been described numerous times long before he used it, with most authors saying it risked injuries. After many attempts, some of them solo, he managed to reach the summit of the Petit Dru in 1879 in the company of two other hired Chamonix guides, Prosper Payot and Frédéric Folliguet. During that ascent, Charlet-Straton again used the technique, with his companions assisting.

== Equipment ==
* Ropes: Static rope is ideal, but often dynamic rope is used.
* Anchors: Usually constructed from trees, boulders, ice or rock features, using webbing/cordelette, or rock climbing equipment. Some areas have fixed anchors such as bolts or pitons.
* Descender: A friction device or friction hitch that allows the rope to be played out in a controlled fashion, under load, with minimal effort by the person controlling it.
* Climbing harness: Fixed around the waist or whole body used to secure the descender. Fit is important to prevent suspension trauma.
* Safety back-up: Typically a friction hitch such as a Prusik, Klemheist knot, or autoblock knot wrapped around the rope as to prevent uncontrolled descents.
* Helmets: Used to protect the head from bumps and falling rocks.
* Gloves: Used to protect hands from the rope and from colliding with the wall. May increase the risk of an accident by becoming caught in the descender.
* Boots or climbing shoes: Used to increase friction against the rock
* Knee pads (and sometimes elbow-pads)

== Application ==
Abseiling is used in a number of applications, including:
* Climbing – for returning to the base of a climb or to a point where one can try a new route.
* Recreation
* Canyoning – to descend tall waterfalls and/or cliffs. 
* Mountaineering 
* Caving and speleology – where underground pitches need to be accessed.
* Adventure racing
* Industrial/commercial applications – to access parts of structures or buildings so as to perform maintenance, cleaning or construction, known as rope access.
* Access to wildfires.
* Confined spaces access – e.g. ballast tanks, manholes
* Rescue applications – used to access injured people on or nearby cliffs.
* Military applications – tactical heliborne insertion of troops, including special forces, into the battlefield close to the objective when proper landing zones are not available.

== Styles/techniques ==

* Australian rappel — Used in the military. The abseiler descends facing downwards allowing them to see where they are going.
* Tandem or spider abseiling — Used in climbing. Involves two climbers descending on the same belay device. This is useful in rescue situations when one of the climbers is incapacitated or the descent needs to be done quickly. The set-up is similar to a regular rappelling, with the incapacitated climber suspended from the descender (and backed up on the primary climbers harness).
* &quot;Simul-rappelling&quot; or &quot;simultaneously rappelling&quot; — Used in climbing and canyoning. Two climbers descend simultaneously on the same length of rope, where one climber&#x27;s weight counterbalances the other. Generally the technique is considered less safe than the regular rappelling; however, it is useful in case of emergencies, or for rapping off opposite sides of a fin or spire where there are no anchor points. This is common in places like the Needles of South Dakota’s Black Hills.
* Counterbalance abseiling — Used in climbing. This rescue technique is typically used by a leader to reach an injured second. The leader abseils off on one strand of rope, using the incapacitated second&#x27;s weight on the other strand of the rope as a counterbalance.
* Releasable abseil — Used by guides. This safety technique allows a leader to descend with inexperienced abseilers. A rope about twice the length of the descent is anchored with a munter mule hitch. The client descends on a single isolated strand of the rope. If the client becomes stuck halfway down the guide will be able to unlock the other strand and lower the client to the ground using the hitch as a belay device. This could be useful if the client panics, or gets clothing or hair entangled in the descender.
* Classical (non-mechanical methods), e.g. the Dülfersitz — Used in emergencies. These technique are more dangerous than modern alternatives and only used when no other option is available. They involve descending without aid of mechanical devices, by wrapping the rope around the body, and were used before the advent of harnesses and hardware.
* South African classical abseil (double-roped) — Used in emergencies. This is a type of classical abseil where the user has a spare hand.
* Fireman&#x27;s Belay — Safety backup. A partner stands on the ground below holding the rope(s). If the abseiler begins to fall they will be able to pull down on the rope to arrest the descent.

== Safety ==
Abseiling can be dangerous and presents risks, especially to unsupervised or inexperienced abseilers. According to German mountaineer Pit Schubert, about 25% of climbing deaths occur during abseiling, most commonly due to failing anchors. An analysis of American Alpine Club accident reports shows that this is followed by inadequate safety backups and rappelling off the ends of ropes.

== Environmental concerns ==
Abseiling is prohibited or discouraged in some areas, as it may cause environmental damage, conflict with climbers heading upwards, and/or endanger people on the ground.

<text>fdisk is a command-line utility for disk partitioning. It has been part of DOS, DR FlexOS, IBM OS/2, and early versions of Microsoft Windows, as well as certain ports of FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD and macOS for compatibility reasons. Windows 2000 and its successors have replaced fdisk with a more advanced tool called diskpart.

==Implementations==

===DOS===
IBM introduced the first version of fdisk (officially dubbed &quot;Fixed Disk Setup Program&quot;) in March 1983, with the release of the IBM PC/XT computer (the first PC to store data on a hard disk) and the IBM PC DOS 2.0 operating system. fdisk version 1.0 can create one FAT12 partition, delete it, change the active partition, or display partition data. fdisk writes the master boot record, which supports up to four partitions. The other three were intended for other operating systems such as CP/M-86 and Xenix, which were expected to have their own partitioning utilities.

Microsoft first added fdisk to MS-DOS in version 3.2. MS-DOS versions 2.0 through 3.10 included OEM-specific partitioning tools, which may have been named fdisk.

PC DOS 3.0, released in August 1984, added support for FAT16 partitions to handle larger hard disks more efficiently. PC DOS 3.30, released in April 1987, added support for extended partitions. (These partitions do not store data directly but can contain up to 23 logical drives.) In both cases, fdisk was modified to work with FAT16 and extended partitions. Support for FAT16B was first added to Compaq&#x27;s fdisk in MS-DOS 3.31. FAT16B later became available with MS-DOS and PC DOS 4.0.

The undocumented codice_1 switch in fdisk, which could repair the master boot record, soon became popular.

IBM PC DOS 7.10 shipped with the new fdisk32 utility.

ROM-DOS, DR DOS 6.0 FlexOS, PTS-DOS 2000 Pro, and FreeDOS, include an implementation of the fdisk command.

===Windows===
Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME shipped with a derivative of the MS-DOS fdisk. Windows 2000 and its successors, however, came with the more advanced diskpart and the graphical Disk Management utilities.

Starting with Windows 95 OSR2, fdisk supports the FAT32 file system. 

The version of fdisk that ships with Windows 95 does not report the correct size of a hard disk that is larger than 64 GB. An updated fdisk is available from Microsoft to correct this issue. In addition, fdisk cannot create partitions larger than 512 GB, even though FAT32 supports partitions as big as 2 TB. This limitation applies to all versions of fdisk supplied with Windows 95 OSR 2.1, Windows 98 and Windows ME.

===IBM OS/2===
Before version 4.0, OS/2 shipped with two partition table managers. These were the text mode fdisk and the graphical fdiskpm. The two have identical functionality, and can manipulate both FAT partitions and the more advanced HPFS partitions.

OS/2 4.5 and higher (including eComStation and ArcaOS) can use the JFS file system, as well as FAT and HPFS. They replaced fdisk with the Logical Volume Manager (LVM).

===Mach and 386BSD===

fdisk for Mach Operating System was written by Robert Baron. It was ported to 386BSD by Julian Elischer, and the implementation is being used by FreeBSD, NetBSD and DragonFly BSD, all as of 2019, as well as the early versions of OpenBSD between 1995 and 1997 before OpenBSD 2.2.

Tobias Weingartner re-wrote fdisk in 1997 before OpenBSD 2.2, which has subsequently been forked by Apple Computer, Inc in 2002, and is still used as the basis for fdisk on macOS as of 2019.

For native partitions, BSD systems traditionally use BSD disklabel, and fdisk partitioning is supported only on certain architectures (for compatibility reasons) and only in addition to the BSD disklabel (which is mandatory).

===Linux===
In Linux, fdisk is a part of a standard package distributed by the Linux Kernel organization, util-linux. The original program was written by Andries E. Brouwer and A. V. Le Blanc and was later rewritten by Karel Zak and Davidlohr Bueso when they forked the util-linux package in 2006. An alternative, ncurses-based program, cfdisk, allows users to create partition layouts via a text-based user interface (TUI).

<doc id="400579" wikidata="Q582479" url="?curid=400579" title="Ligature (music)">
<text>In music notation, a ligature is a graphic symbol that tells a musician to perform two or more notes in a single gesture, and on a single syllable. It was primarily used from around 800 to 1650 AD. Ligatures are characteristic of neumatic (chant) and mensural notation. The notation and meaning of ligatures has changed significantly throughout Western music history, and their precise interpretation is a continuing subject of debate among musicologists.

==History==
===Plainchant===
The early notation of plainchant, particularly Gregorian chant, used a series of shapes called neumes, which served as reminders of music that was taught by rote rather than as an exact record of which notes to sing. Neumes were in use from the 9th through the 11th centuries AD for most plainsong, and differed by region. Due to their malleable nature, there were no hard and fast rules for the lengths each note was supposed to last, or even how high or low the intervals between notes were to be.

===&quot;De mensurabili musica&quot;===

A treatise on notation named &quot;De mensurabili musica&quot; was copied around 1260. In this treatise, the anonymous author proposed that, much in the same way that poetry of the time was based on a series of modal rhythms, music should also be set up in this way. The notation of these modes was accomplished primarily through using ligatures in varying lengths and with varying degrees of complexity, where the rhythms would be derived from context. For most of their notated history, this was the purpose of ligatures: to indicate the rhythmic mode.

===Franco of Cologne===

Around 1250, a music theorist named Franco of Cologne published a treatise on music entitled &quot;Ars cantus mensurabilis&quot;. In this treatise, Franco proposed that note values should be set up objectively, so that when looking at the notated music, a musician would be able to tell what notes were being sung or played, and the duration of those notes, with some degree of certainty. Ligatures were used for this as well, as they had become more or less standardized through the practice of the rhythmic modes.

===Polyphonic music from c1300-c1600===
See mensural notation (ligatures).

==Usage==

Ligatures have two basic shapes: &quot;box&quot; (rectangular) and &quot;oblique&quot; (angled). Additionally, some ligatures have tails that either point up or down; the direction of the ligature&#x27;s tail affects its meaning, unlike the direction of a tail on a modern note head. While primarily contextual, the system of ligatures in use from the 13th to the 16th century is fairly standardized. All ligatures of this period have the following principles in common:
*All ligature notes are either the length of a &quot;longa&quot; (&quot;&quot;L&quot;), a &quot;breve&quot; (&quot;B&quot;), or a &quot;semibreve&quot; (&quot;S&quot;&quot;).
*All ligatures have at least two notes.
*For ease of discussion, ligatures of different lengths have different names. A ligature with two notes is called a &quot;binaria&quot;; one with three notes, a &quot;ternaria&quot;; one with four notes, a &quot;quaternaria&quot;; and one with five notes, a &quot;quinaria&quot;. Larger ones are possible, but rare.
*If a ligature has three or more notes, all notes in the middle (the &quot;mediae&quot;) are &quot;B&quot;.
*A downward tail changes the value of the note where the tail occurs, either from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;B&quot; or, less commonly, from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;L&quot;.
*An upward tail indicates that the next &quot;two&quot; notes are a series of &quot;S&quot;.
*A tail at the end of a ligature indicates an additional note be sung or played, called a &quot;plica&quot;, that is not part of the ligature. Plicas were especially common with the rhythmic modes, to accommodate in practice what could not be accomplished within the very strict theoretical basis for modal music.

===Alternate interpretations===

Most scholarship on ligatures is focused on period from the 13th to the 16th centuries. Prior to this period, ligatures were far less standardized; a &quot;quaternaria&quot; ligature that, under the above rules, would mean a series like &quot;SSLB&quot; would simply mean &quot;BBBB&quot;.

==Transcription==

In transcribing old works to modern notation, where no compound graphs as ligatures exist, editors usually indicate by a hook, a bracket (brace), or (less often in polyphonic music) a slur/phrase mark those notes that the original combined into a ligature. To avoid confusion, many scores transcribed purely for performance do not include additional notation to indicate that a particular note originally belonged to a ligature, as most methods to show this have separate meanings in a performance capacity.

<text>cfdisk is a Linux partition editor, similar to fdisk, but with a different, curses-based user interface. It is part of the util-linux package of Linux utility programs.

The current cfdisk implementation utilizes the libfdisk library and supports partitioning of disks that use Master boot record, GUID Partition Table, BSD disklabel, SGI or SUN disk labels.
It also provides information about mount points and general partition information like partition names, types/flags, sizing and UUIDs.

If invoked without arguments, cfdisk attempts to read the current partition table from the disk drive and present its findings.

<text>In writing and typography, a ligature occurs where two or more graphemes or letters are joined to form a single glyph. Examples are the characters and used in English and French, in which the letters and are joined for the first ligature and the letters and are joined for the second ligature. For stylistic and legibility reasons, and are often merged to create (where the tittle on the merges with the hood of the ); the same is true of and to create . The common ampersand, , developed from a ligature in which the handwritten Latin letters and (spelling , Latin for &#x27;and&#x27;) were combined.

==History==

The earliest known script Sumerian cuneiform and Egyptian hieratic both include many cases of character combinations that gradually evolve from ligatures into separately recognizable characters. Other notable ligatures, such as the Brahmic abugidas and the Germanic bind rune, figure prominently throughout ancient manuscripts. These new glyphs emerge alongside the proliferation of writing with a stylus, whether on paper or clay, and often for a practical reason: faster handwriting. Merchants especially needed a way to speed up the process of written communication and found that conjoining letters and abbreviating words for lay use was more convenient for record keeping and transaction than the bulky long forms.

Around the 9th and 10th centuries, monasteries became a fountainhead for these type of script modifications. Medieval scribes who wrote in Latin increased their writing speed by combining characters and by introducing notational abbreviations. Others conjoined letters for aesthetic purposes. For example, in blackletter, letters with right-facing bowls (, , and ) and those with left-facing bowls (, , , , and ) were written with the facing edges of the bowls superimposed. In many script forms, characters such as , , and had their vertical strokes superimposed. Scribes also used notational abbreviations to avoid having to write a whole character in one stroke. Manuscripts in the fourteenth century employed hundreds of such abbreviations.

In handwriting, a ligature is made by joining two or more characters in an atypical fashion by merging their parts, or by writing one above or inside the other. In printing, a ligature is a group of characters that is typeset as a unit, so the characters do not have to be joined. For example, in some cases the ligature prints the letters and with a greater separation than when they are typeset as separate letters. When printing with movable type was invented around 1450, typefaces included many ligatures and additional letters, as they were based on handwriting. Ligatures made printing with movable type easier because one sort would replace frequent combinations of letters and also allowed more complex and interesting character designs which would otherwise collide with one another.

Because of their complexity, ligatures began to fall out of use in the 20th century. Sans serif typefaces, increasingly used for body text, generally avoid ligatures, though notable exceptions include Gill Sans and Futura. Inexpensive phototypesetting machines in the 1970s (which did not require journeyman knowledge or training to operate) also generally avoid them. A few, however, became characters in their own right, see below the sections about German ß, various Latin accented letters, &amp; et al.

The trend against digraph use was further strengthened by the desktop publishing revolution. Early computer software in particular had no way to allow for ligature substitution (the automatic use of ligatures where appropriate), while most new digital typefaces did not include ligatures. As most of the early PC development was designed for the English language (which already treated ligatures as optional at best) dependence on ligatures did not carry over to digital. Ligature use fell as the number of traditional hand compositors and hot metal typesetting machine operators dropped because of the mass production of the IBM Selectric brand of electric typewriter in 1961. A designer active in the period commented: &quot;some of the world&#x27;s greatest typefaces were quickly becoming some of the world&#x27;s worst fonts.&quot;

Ligatures have grown in popularity in the 21st century because of an increasing interest in creating typesetting systems that evoke arcane designs and classical scripts. One of the first computer typesetting programs to take advantage of computer-driven typesetting (and later laser printers) was Donald Knuth&#x27;s TeX program. Now the standard method of mathematical typesetting, its default fonts are explicitly based on nineteenth-century styles. Many new fonts feature extensive ligature sets; these include FF Scala, Seria and others by Martin Majoor and Hoefler Text by Jonathan Hoefler. Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko contains a particularly large set to allow designers to create dramatic display text with a feel of antiquity.
A parallel use of ligatures is seen in the creation of script fonts that join letterforms to simulate handwriting effectively. This trend is caused in part by the increased support for other languages and alphabets in modern computing, many of which use ligatures somewhat extensively. This has caused the development of new digital typesetting techniques such as OpenType, and the incorporation of ligature support into the text display systems of macOS, Windows, and applications like Microsoft Office. An increasing modern trend is to use a &quot;Th&quot; ligature which reduces spacing between these letters to make it easier to read, a trait infrequent in metal type.

Today, modern font programming divides ligatures into three groups, which can be activated separately: standard, contextual and historical. Standard ligatures are needed to allow the font to display without errors such as character collision. Designers sometimes find contextual and historic ligatures desirable for creating effects or to evoke an old-fashioned print look.

==Latin alphabet==
=== Stylistic ligatures ===
Many ligatures combine with the following letter. A particularly prominent example is (or , rendered with two normal letters). The tittle of the in many typefaces collides with the hood of the when placed beside each other in a word, and are combined into a single glyph with the tittle absorbed into the . Other ligatures with the letter f include , (ﬂ), (ﬀ), (ﬃ), and (ﬄ). In Linotype, ligature matrices for , , , , , , , , , , and for followed by a full stop, comma, or hyphen are optional in many typefaces, as well as the equivalent set for the doubled , as a method to overcome the machine&#x27;s physical restrictions.

These arose because with the usual type sort for lowercase , the end of its hood is on a kern, which would be damaged by collision with raised parts of the next letter.

Ligatures crossing the morpheme boundary of a composite word are sometimes considered incorrect, especially in official German orthography as outlined in the &quot;Duden&quot;. An English example of this would be in &quot;shelfful&quot;; a German example would be (&quot;boat trip&quot;). Some computer programs (such as TeX) provide a setting to disable ligatures for German, while some users have also written macros to identify which ligatures to disable.

Turkish distinguishes dotted and dotless &quot;I&quot;. If a ligature with &quot;f&quot; were to be used in words such as [oven] and [idea], this contrast would be obscured. The ligature, at least in the form typical to other languages, is therefore not used in Turkish typography.
Remnants of the ligatures / (&quot;sharp s&quot;, ) and / (&quot;sharp t&quot;, ) from Fraktur, a family of German blackletter typefaces, originally mandatory in Fraktur but now employed only stylistically, can be seen to this day on street signs for city squares whose name contains or ends in . Instead, the &quot;sz&quot; ligature has merged into a single character, the German ß – see below.

Sometimes, ligatures for (ﬆ), (ﬅ), , , , and are used (e.g. in the typeface Linux Libertine).

Besides conventional ligatures, in the metal type era some newspapers commissioned custom condensed single sorts for the names of common long names that might appear in news headings, such as &quot;Eisenhower&quot;, &quot;Chamberlain&quot;. In these cases the characters did not appear combined, just more tightly spaced than if printed conventionally.

===German ß===

The German letter (, also called the , meaning &quot;sharp s&quot;) is an official letter of the alphabet in Germany and Austria. A recognizable ligature representing the digraph develops in handwriting in the early 14th century. Its name (meaning S-Z) suggests a connection of &quot;long s and z&quot; (ſʒ) but the Latin script also knows a ligature of &quot;long s over round s&quot; (ſs). Since German was mostly set in blackletter typefaces until the 1940s, and those typefaces were rarely set in uppercase, a capital version of the never came into common use, even though its creation has been discussed since the end of the 19th century. Therefore, the common replacement in uppercase typesetting was originally SZ ( &quot;measure&quot; → , different from &quot;mass&quot; → ) and later SS ( → ). Until 2017, the SS replacement was the only valid spelling according to the official orthography in Germany and Austria. In Switzerland, the ß is omitted altogether in favour of ss. The capital version (ẞ) of the Eszett character was occasionally used since 1905/06, has been part of Unicode since 2008, and has appeared in more and more typefaces. Since the end of 2010, the has suggested the new upper case character for &quot;ß&quot; rather than replacing it with &quot;SS&quot; or &quot;SZ&quot; for geographical names. A new standardized German keyboard layout (DIN 2137-T2) has included the capital ß since 2012. The new character entered the official orthographic rules in June 2017.

===Massachusett ꝏ===
A prominent feature of the colonial orthography created by John Eliot (later used in the first Bible printed in the Americas, the Massachusett-language , published in 1663) was the use of the double-o ligature to represent the of &quot;food&quot; as opposed to the of &quot;hook&quot; (although Eliot himself used and interchangeably). In the orthography in use since 2000 in the Wampanoag communities participating in the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project (WLRP), the ligature was replaced with the numeral , partly because of its ease in typesetting and display as well as its similarity to the o-u ligature used in Abenaki. For example, compare the colonial-era spelling with the modern Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project (WLRP) spelling .
=== Letter W ===
As the letter is an addition to the Latin alphabet that originated in the seventh century, the phoneme it represents was formerly written in various ways. In Old English, the runic letter wynn ) was used, but Norman influence forced wynn out of use. By the 14th century, the &quot;new&quot; letter , originated as two glyphs or glyphs joined, developed into a legitimate letter with its own position in the alphabet. Because of its relative youth compared to other letters of the alphabet, only a few European languages (English, Dutch, German, Polish, Welsh, Maltese, and Walloon) use the letter in native words.

=== Æ and Œ ===
The character (lower case ; in ancient times named ) when used in Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, or Old English is not a typographic ligature. It is a distinct letter — a vowel — and when collated, may be given a different place in the alphabetical order than .

In modern English orthography, is not considered an independent letter but a spelling variant, for example: &quot;&quot; versus &quot;encyclopaedia&quot; or &quot;encyclopedia&quot;. In this use, comes from Medieval Latin, where it was an optional ligature in some specific words that had been transliterated and borrowed from Ancient Greek, for example, &quot;Æneas&quot;. It is still found as a variant in English and French words descended or borrowed from Medieval Latin, but the trend has recently been towards printing the and separately. 

Similarly, and , while normally printed as ligatures in French, are replaced by component letters if technical restrictions require it.

=== Umlaut ===
In German orthography, the umlauted vowels , , and historically arose from , , ligatures (strictly, from these vowels with a small letter written as a diacritic, for example , , ). It is common practice to replace them with , , digraphs when the diacritics are unavailable, for example in electronic conversation. Phone books treat umlauted vowels as equivalent to the relevant digraph (so that a name Müller will appear at the same place as if it were spelled Mueller; German surnames have a strongly fixed orthography, either a name is spelled with or with ); however, the alphabetic order used in other books treats them as equivalent to the simple letters , and . The convention in Scandinavian languages and Finnish is different: there the umlaut vowels are treated as independent letters with positions at the end of the alphabet.

=== Middle English===
In Middle English, the word &quot;the&quot; (written &quot;þe&quot;) was frequently abbreviated as , a (thorn) with a small written as a diacritic. Similarly, the word &quot;that&quot; was abbreviated to , a with a small written as a diacritic. During the latter Middle English and Early Modern English periods, the thorn in its common script, or cursive, form came to resemble a shape. With the arrival of movable type printing, the substitution of for became ubiquitous, leading to the common &quot;ye&quot;, as in &#x27;Ye Olde Curiositie Shoppe&#x27;. One major reason for this was that existed in the printer&#x27;s types that William Caxton and his contemporaries imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, while did not.

=== Ring ===
The &quot;ring&quot; diacritic used in vowels such as likewise originated as an -ligature. Before the replacement of the older &quot;aa&quot; with &quot;å&quot; became a practice, an &quot;a&quot; with another &quot;a&quot; on top (aͣ) could sometimes be used, for example in Johannes Bureus&#x27;s, &quot;Runa: ABC-Boken&quot; (1611). The ligature ů in particular saw use in Early Modern High German, but it merged in later Germanic languages with (e.g. MHG , ENHG , Modern German &quot;foot&quot;). It survives in Czech, where it is called .

=== Hwair ===
The letter hwair (ƕ), used only in transliteration of the Gothic language, resembles a ligature. It was introduced by philologists around 1900 to replace the digraph formerly used to express the phoneme in question, e.g. by Migne in the 1860s ( vol. 18).

=== Byzantine Ȣ ===
The Byzantines had a unique o-u ligature that, while originally based on the Greek alphabet&#x27;s ο-υ, carried over into Latin alphabets as well. This ligature is still seen today on icon artwork in Greek Orthodox churches, and sometimes in graffiti or other forms of informal or decorative writing.

=== Gha (OI) ===
Gha , a rarely used letter based on Q and G, was misconstrued by the ISO to be an OI ligature because of its appearance, and is thus known (to the ISO and, in turn, Unicode) as &quot;Oi&quot;. Historically, it was used in many Latin-based orthographies of Turkic (e.g., Azerbaijani) and other central Asian languages.

=== International Phonetic Alphabet ===
The International Phonetic Alphabet formerly used ligatures to represent affricate consonants, of which six are encoded in Unicode: and . One fricative consonant is still represented with a ligature: , and the extensions to the IPA contain three more: , and .

=== Initial Teaching Alphabet ===
The Initial Teaching Alphabet, a short-lived alphabet intended for young children, used a number of ligatures to represent long vowels: , , , , , and ligatures for , and that are not encoded in Unicode. Ligatures for consonants also existed, including ligatures of , , , , and a reversed with (neither the reversed t nor any of the consonant ligatures are in Unicode).

=== Rare ligatures ===
Rarer ligatures also exist, including ; ; ; ; (barred ); ; , which is used in medieval Nordic languages for (a long close-mid back rounded vowel), as well as in some orthographies of the Massachusett language to represent (a long close back rounded vowel); ᵺ; ỻ, which was used in Medieval Welsh to represent (the voiceless lateral fricative); ꜩ; ᴂ; ᴔ; and ꭣ have Unicode codepoints (in code block Latin Extended-E for characters used in German dialectology (Teuthonista), the Anthropos alphabet, Sakha and Americanist usage).

===Symbols originating as ligatures===

The most common ligature in modern usage is the ampersand . This was originally a ligature of and , forming the Latin word &quot;et&quot;, meaning &quot;and&quot;. It has exactly the same use in French and in English. The ampersand comes in many different forms. Because of its ubiquity, it is generally no longer considered a ligature, but a logogram. Like many other ligatures, it has at times been considered a letter (e.g., in early Modern English); in English it is pronounced &quot;and&quot;, not &quot;et&quot;, except in the case of , pronounced &quot;et cetera&quot;. In most typefaces, it does not immediately resemble the two letters used to form it, although certain typefaces use designs in the form of a ligature (examples include the original versions of Futura and Univers, Trebuchet MS, and Civilité, known in modern times as the italic of Garamond).

Similarly, the number sign originated as a stylized abbreviation of the Roman term , written as ℔. Over time, the number sign was simplified to how it is seen today, with two horizontal strokes across two slash-like strokes. Now a logogram, the symbol is used mainly to denote (in the US) numbers, and weight in pounds. It has also been used popularly on push-button telephones and as the hashtag indicator.

The at sign is potentially a ligature, but there are many different theories about the origin. One theory says that the French word &quot;à&quot; (meaning &quot;at&quot;), was simplified by scribes who, instead of lifting the pen to write the grave accent, drew an arc around the &quot;a&quot;. Another states that it is short for the Latin word for &quot;toward&quot;, &quot;ad&quot;, with the being represented by the arc. Another says it is short for an abbreviation of the term &quot;each at&quot;, with the encasing the . Around the 18th century, it started being used in commerce to indicate price per unit, as &quot;15 units @ $1&quot;. After the popularization of Email, this fairly unpopular character became widely known, used to tag specific users. Lately, it has been used to de-gender nouns in Spanish with no agreed pronunciation.

The dollar sign possibly originated as a ligature (for &quot;pesos&quot;, although there are other theories as well) but is now a logogram. At least once, the United States dollar used a symbol resembling an overlapping U-S ligature, with the right vertical bar of the U intersecting through the middle of the S ( US ) to resemble the modern dollar sign.

The Spanish peseta was sometimes symbolized by a ligature (from Pts), and the French franc was often symbolized by the ligature (from Fr).

In astronomy, the planetary symbol for Mercury () may be a ligature of Mercury&#x27;s caduceus and a cross (which was added in the 16th century to Christianize the pagan symbol), though other sources disagree; the symbol for Venus may be a ligature of the Greek letters (phi) and (kappa). The symbol for Jupiter () descends from a Greek zeta with a horizontal stroke, , as an abbreviation for &quot;Zeus&quot;.
Saturn&#x27;s astronomical symbol () has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a horizontal stroke, as an abbreviation for (Cronus), the Greek name for the planet. It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century to Christianize it. 
The dwarf planet Pluto is symbolized by a PL ligature, .

A different PL ligature, , represents the property line in surveying. 

In engineering diagrams, a CL ligature, , represents the center line of an object.

The interrobang is an unconventional punctuation meant to combine the interrogation point (or the question mark) and the bang (printer&#x27;s slang for exclamation mark) into one symbol, used to denote a sentence which is both a question and is exclaimed. For example, the sentence &quot;Is that actually true‽&quot; shows that the speaker is surprised while asking their question.

Alchemy used a set of mostly standardized symbols, many of which were ligatures: 🜇 (AR, for aqua regia); 🜈 (S inside a V, for aqua vitae); 🝫 (MB, for [Mary&#x27;s bath], a double boiler); 🝬 (VB, for , a steam bath); and 🝛 (&quot;aaa&quot; with overline, for amalgam).

===Digraphs===

Digraphs, such as in Spanish or Welsh, are not ligatures in the general case as the two letters are displayed as separate glyphs: although written together, when they are joined in handwriting or italic fonts the base form of the letters is not changed and the individual glyphs remain separate. Like some ligatures discussed above, these digraphs may or may not be considered individual letters in their respective languages. Until the 1994 spelling reform, the digraphs and were considered separate letters in Spanish for collation purposes. Catalan makes a difference between &quot;Spanish ll&quot; or palatalized l, written as in (law), and &quot;French ll&quot; or geminated l, written as in (colleague).

The difference can be illustrated with the French digraph , which is composed of the ligature and the simplex letter .

=== Dutch IJ ===
In Dutch, can be considered a digraph, a ligature, or a letter in itself, depending on the standard used. Its uppercase and lowercase forms are often available as a single glyph with a distinctive ligature in several professional typefaces (e.g. Zapfino). Sans serif uppercase glyphs, popular in the Netherlands, typically use a ligature resembling a with a broken left-hand stroke. Adding to the confusion, Dutch handwriting can render (which is not found in native Dutch words, but occurs in words borrowed from other languages) as a -glyph without the dots in its lowercase form and the in its uppercase form looking virtually identical (only slightly bigger). When written as two separate letters, both should be capitalized or both not to form a correctly spelled word, like or (ice).

==Non-Latin alphabets==

Ligatures are not limited to Latin script:
*The Armenian alphabet has the following ligatures: և (ե+ւ), ﬔ (մ+ե), ﬕ (մ+ի), ﬓ (մ+ն), ﬗ (մ+խ), ﬖ (վ+ն)
*Most Brahmic abugidas make frequent use of ligatures in consonant clusters. The number of ligatures employed is language-dependent; thus many more ligatures are conventionally used in Devanagari when writing Sanskrit than when writing Hindi. Having 37 consonants in total, the total number of ligatures that can be formed in Devanagari using only two letters is 1369, though few fonts are able to render all of them. In particular, Mangal, which is included with Microsoft Windows&#x27; Indic support, does not correctly handle ligatures with consonants attached to the right of the characters द, ट, ठ, ड, and ढ, leaving the virama attached to them and displaying the following consonant in its standard form.
*The Georgian script includes უ (uni), which is a combination of ო (oni) and the former letter ჳ (vie).
*A number of ligatures have been employed in the Greek alphabet, in particular a combination of omicron (Ο) and upsilon (Υ), which later gave rise to a letter of the Cyrillic script—see Ou (letter). Among the ancient Greek acrophonic numerals, ligatures were common (in fact, the ligature of a short-legged capital pi was a key feature of the acrophonic numeral system).
*Cyrillic ligatures: Љ, Њ, Ы, Ѿ. Iotated Cyrillic letters are ligatures of the early Cyrillic decimal I and another vowel: Ꙗ, Ѥ, Ѩ, Ѭ, Ю (sometimes also spelled ЮУ). In Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, the letters lje and nje (љ, њ), were developed as ligatures of Cyrillic used in Serbian Language, being El and En (л, н) with the soft sign (ь). They were invented by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić for use in his 1818 dictionary, replacing the earlier digraphs ⟨ль⟩ and ⟨нь⟩. The Yae, a ligature of ya (Я) and e also exists: Ԙԙ, as do Dzze (Ꚉꚉ ← Д + З) and Zhwe (Ꚅꚅ ← З + Ж).
*Some forms of the Glagolitic script, used from Middle Ages to the 19th century to write some Slavic languages, have a box-like shape that lends itself to more frequent use of ligatures.
*In the Hebrew alphabet, the letters aleph () and lamed () can form a ligature, . The ligature appears in some pre-modern texts (mainly religious), or in Judeo-Arabic texts, where that combination is very frequent, since &quot;[ʔ] [a]l-&quot; (written aleph plus lamed, in the Hebrew script) is the definite article in Arabic. For example, the word &quot;Allah&quot; () can be written with this ligature: .
*In the Arabic alphabet, historically a cursive derived from the Nabataean alphabet, most letters&#x27; shapes depend on whether they are followed (word-initial), preceded (word-final) or both (medial) by other letters. For example, Arabic mīm, isolated , tripled (&quot;mmm&quot;, rendering as initial, medial and final): . Notable are the shapes taken by lām + ʼalif isolated: , and lām + ʼalif medial or final: . Besides the obligatory lām + ʼalif ligature, Arabic script grammar requires numerous stylistic ligatures.
*Syriac, a semitic alphabet derived from the Aramaic alphabet, has three different scripts that all use ligatures. Like Arabic, some letters change their form depending on their position in relation to other letters, and this can also change how ligatures look. A popular ligature all three scripts use is Lamadh / + Alap / isolated and final: (Serto) , (Madnhaya) . Another popular one is Taw / + Alap /, resulting in (Serto) , (Madhnhaya) . All three scripts use ligatures, but not in an equal spread or always with the same letters. Serto, being a flexible script, especially has many ligatures. For a wider, but not complete, list of Syriac ligatures, see &quot;Contextual forms of letters&quot;.
*Urdu (one of the main languages of South Asia), which uses a calligraphic version of the Arabic-based Nastaʿlīq script, requires a great number of ligatures in digital typography. InPage, a widely used desktop publishing tool for Urdu, uses Nastaliq fonts with over 20,000 ligatures.
*In American Sign Language a ligature of the American manual alphabet is used to sign &quot;I love you&quot;, from the English initialism ILY. It consists of the little finger of the letter I plus the thumb and forefinger of the letter L. The letter Y (little finger and thumb) overlaps with the other two letters.
*The Japanese language has a number of obsolete kana ligatures. Of these, only two are widely available ones on computers: one for hiragana, ゟ, which is a vertical writing ligature of the characters よ and り; and one for katakana, ヿ, which is a vertical writing ligature of the characters コ and ト.
*Lao uses three ligatures, all comprising the letter ຫ (h). As a tonal language, most consonant sounds in Lao are represented by two consonants, which will govern the tone of the syllable. Five consonant sounds are only represented by a single consonant letter (ງ (ŋ), ນ (m), ມ (n), ລ (l), ວ (w)), meaning that one cannot render all the tones for words beginning with these sounds. A silent ຫ indicates that the syllable should be read with the tone rules for ຫ, rather than those of the following consonant. Three consonants can form ligatures with the letter ຫ. ຫ+ນ=ໜ (n), ຫ+ມ=ໝ (m) and ຫ+ລ=ຫຼ (l). ງ (ŋ) and ວ (w) just form clusters: ຫງ (ŋ) and ຫວ (w). ລ (l) can also be used written in a cluster rather than as a ligature: ຫລ (l).
*In many runic texts ligatures are common. Such ligatures are known as bind-runes and were optional.

===Chinese ligatures===
Written Chinese has a long history of creating new characters by merging parts or wholes of other Chinese characters. However, a few of these combinations do not represent morphemes but retain the original multi-character (multiple morpheme) reading and are therefore not considered true characters themselves. In Chinese, these ligatures are called () or (); see polysyllabic Chinese characters for more.

One popular ligature used on decorations used for Chinese Lunar New Year is a combination of the four characters for (), meaning &quot;ushering in wealth and fortune&quot; and used as a popular New Year&#x27;s greeting.
In 1924, (; 1898–1967) created the ligature from two of the three characters (), meaning &quot;library&quot;. Although it does have an assigned pronunciation of and appears in many dictionaries, it is not a morpheme and cannot be used as such in Chinese. Instead, it is usually considered a graphic representation of .

In recent years, a Chinese internet meme, the Grass Mud Horse, has had such a ligature associated with it combining the three relevant Chinese characters , , and ().

Similar to the ligatures were several &quot;two-syllable Chinese characters&quot; () created in the 19th century as Chinese characters for SI units. In Chinese these units are disyllabic and standardly written with two characters, as &quot;centimeter&quot; ( centi-, meter) or &quot;kilowatt&quot;. However, in the 19th century these were often written via compound characters, pronounced disyllabically, such as for or for – some of these characters were also used in Japan, where they were pronounced with borrowed European readings instead. These have now fallen out of general use, but are occasionally seen.
===Japanese ligatures===
The CJK Compatibility Unicode block features characters that have been combined into one square character in legacy character set so that it matches Japanese text.
For example, the Japanese equivalent of &quot;stock company&quot;, () can be represented in 1 Unicode character .
Its romanized abbreviation can also be 1 character .
There are other Latin abbreviations such as &quot;kg&quot; for &quot;kilogram&quot; that can be ligated into 1 square character .

==Computer typesetting==

The OpenType font format includes features for associating multiple glyphs to a single character, used for ligature substitution. Typesetting software may or may not implement this feature, even if it is explicitly present in the font&#x27;s metadata. XeTeX is a TeX typesetting engine designed to make the most of such advanced features. This type of substitution used to be needed mainly for typesetting Arabic texts, but ligature lookups and substitutions are being put into all kinds of Western Latin OpenType fonts. In OpenType, there are standard codice_1, historical codice_2, contextual codice_3, discretionary codice_4 and required codice_5 ligatures.

===TeX===

Opinion is divided over whether it is the job of writers or typesetters to decide where to use ligatures. TeX is an example of a computer typesetting system that makes use of ligatures automatically. The Computer Modern Roman typeface provided with TeX includes the five common ligatures , , , , and . When TeX finds these combinations in a text, it substitutes the appropriate ligature, unless overridden by the typesetter.

===CSS===
CSS3 provides control over these properties using codice_6, though the CSS Fonts Module Level 4 draft standard indicates that authors should prefer several other properties. Those include codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, and codice_11.

===Ligatures in Unicode (Latin alphabets)===
This table below shows discrete letter pairs on the left, the corresponding Unicode ligature in the middle column, and the Unicode code point on the right. Provided you are using an operating system and browser that can handle Unicode, and have the correct Unicode fonts installed, some or all of these will display correctly. See also the provided graphic.

Unicode maintains that ligaturing is a presentation issue rather than a character definition issue, and that, for example, &quot;if a modern font is asked to display &#x27;h&#x27; followed by &#x27;r&#x27;, and the font has an &#x27;hr&#x27; ligature in it, it can display the ligature.&quot; Accordingly, the use of the special Unicode ligature characters is &quot;discouraged&quot;, and &quot;no more will be encoded in any circumstances&quot;. (Unicode has continued to add ligatures, but only in such cases that the ligatures were used as distinct letters in a language or could be interpreted as standalone symbols. For example, ligatures such as æ and œ are not used to replace arbitrary &quot;ae&quot; or &quot;oe&quot; sequences; it is generally considered incorrect to write &quot;does&quot; as &quot;dœs&quot;.)

Microsoft Word disables ligature substitution by default, largely for backward compatibility when editing documents created in earlier versions of Word. Users can enable automatic ligature substitution on the Advanced tab of the Font dialog box.

LibreOffice Writer enables standard ligature substitution by default for OpenType fonts, user can enable or disable any ligature substitution on the Features dialog box, which is accessible via the Features button of the Character dialog box, or alternatively, input a syntax with font name and feature into the Font Name input box, for example: &quot;Noto Sans:liga=0&quot;.


There are separate code points for the digraph DZ, the Dutch digraph IJ, and for the Serbo-Croatian digraphs DŽ, LJ, and NJ. Although similar, these are digraphs, not ligatures. See Digraphs in Unicode.

====Ligatures used only in phonetic transcription====

Four &quot;ligature ornaments&quot; are included from U+1F670 to U+1F673 in the Ornamental Dingbats block: regular and bold variants of ℯT (script e and T) and of ɛT (open E and T).

==Contemporary art==
Typographic ligatures are used in a form of contemporary art, as can be illustrated by Chinese artist Xu Bing&#x27;s work in which he combines Latin letters to form characters that resemble Chinese. Croatian designer Maja Škripelj also created a ligature that combined Glagolitic letters ⰘⰓ for euro coins.

<doc id="400587" wikidata="Q1052609" url="?curid=400587" title="Macintosh 512Ke">
<text>The Macintosh 512K enhanced (512Ke) was introduced in April 1986 as a cheaper alternative to the top-of-the-line Macintosh Plus, which had debuted three months previously. It is the same as the Macintosh 512K but with the 800K disk drive and 128K of ROM used in the Macintosh Plus. Like its predecessors, it has little room for expansion. Some companies did create memory upgrades that brought the machine up to 2 MB or more.

==Model differences==
Originally, the case was identical to its predecessor, except for the model number listed on the rear bucket&#x27;s agency approval label. It used the same beige-like color as well. Later in its lifespan, the 512Ke was discounted and offered to the educational market, badged as the &quot;Macintosh ED&quot; (M0001D &amp; later M0001ED).

The 512Ke shipped with the original short Macintosh Keyboard, but the extended Macintosh Plus Keyboard with built-in numeric keypad could be purchased optionally. A version of the 512Ke only sold outside of North America included the full keyboard and was marketed as the &quot;Macintosh 512K/800&quot;. Later, the larger keyboard would be included as standard in North America as well.

Although the 512Ke includes the same 128K ROMs and 800K disk drive as the Mac Plus, the 512Ke retains the same port connectors as the original Mac. For this reason, 512Ke users&#x27; only hard disk option is the slower, floppy-port-based Hard Disk 20, or similar products for the serial port, even though the 512Ke ROMs contain the &quot;SCSI Manager&quot; software that enables the use of faster SCSI hard disks (because the ROMs are the same as the ones used in the Mac Plus, which does have a SCSI port). Apple did point users to certain third-party products which could be added to the 512Ke to provide a SCSI port.

==Official upgrades==
A Macintosh 512K could be upgraded to a 512Ke by purchasing and installing Apple&#x27;s $299 &quot;Macintosh Plus Disk Drive Kit&quot;. This included the following:
* 800 KB double-sided floppy disk drive to replace the original 400 KB single-sided drive
* 128 KB ROM chips to replace original 64 KB ROM
* Macintosh Plus System Tools disk with updated system software
* Installation guide
One further upgrade made by Apple replaced the logic board and the rear case (to accommodate the different port configuration) with those of the Macintosh Plus, providing built-in SCSI functionality and up to 4 MB RAM. Because Apple&#x27;s official upgrades were costly, many third-party manufacturers offered add-on SCSI cards, as well as RAM upgrades, to achieve the same functionality. The new ROM allowed the computer to run much newer system and application software; though it loaded more data into RAM, it only slightly decreased the amount of available memory – by 1.5 KB – leaving well over 370 KB available for applications.

==System software==
After June 1986, the 512Ke shipped with System 3.2. After it was discontinued, Apple changed the recommended OS for the 512Ke to System 4.1. System 6.0.8 is the maximum OS for the 512Ke.

<doc id="400593" wikidata="Q1882848" url="?curid=400593" title="Macintosh SE">
<text>The Macintosh SE is a personal computer designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer, from March 1987 to October 1990. It marked a significant improvement on the Macintosh Plus design and was introduced by Apple at the same time as the Macintosh II.

The SE retains the same Compact Macintosh form factor as the original Macintosh computer introduced three years earlier and uses the same design language used by the Macintosh II. An enhanced model, the SE/30, was introduced in January 1989; sales of the original SE continued. The Macintosh SE was updated in August 1989 to include a SuperDrive, with this updated version being called the &quot;Macintosh SE FDHD&quot; and later the &quot;Macintosh SE SuperDrive&quot;. The Macintosh SE was replaced with the Macintosh Classic, a very similar model which retained the same central processing unit and form factor, but at a lower price point.

== Overview ==
The Macintosh SE was introduced at the AppleWorld conference in Los Angeles on March 2, 1987. The &quot;SE&quot; is an initialism for &quot;System Expansion&quot;. Its notable new features, compared to its similar predecessor, the Macintosh Plus, were:
* First compact Macintosh with an internal drive bay for a hard disk (originally 20 MB or 40 MB) or a second floppy disk drive.
* First compact Macintosh to feature an expansion slot.
* First Macintosh to support the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), previously only available on the Apple IIGS, for keyboard and mouse connections.
* Improved SCSI support, providing faster data throughput (double that of the Macintosh Plus) and a standard 50-pin internal SCSI connector.
* Better reliability and longer life expectancy (15 years of continuous use) due to the addition of a cooling fan.
* 25 percent greater speed when accessing RAM, resulting in a lower percentage of CPU time being spent drawing the screen. In practice this results in a 10-20 percent performance improvement.
* Additional fonts and kerning routines in the Toolbox ROM
* Disk First Aid is included on the system disk

The SE and Macintosh II were the first Apple computers since the Apple I to be sold without a keyboard. Instead the customer was offered the choice of the new ADB Apple Keyboard or the Apple Extended Keyboard.

Apple produced ten SEs with transparent cases as prototypes for promotional shots and employees. They are extremely rare and command a premium price for collectors.

=== Operating system ===
The Macintosh SE shipped with System 4.0 and Finder 5.4; this version is specific to this computer. (The Macintosh II, which was announced at the same time but shipped a month later, included System 4.1 and Finder 5.5.) The README file included with the installation disks for the SE and II is the first place Apple ever used the term &quot;Macintosh System Software&quot;, and after 1998 these two versions were retroactively given the name &quot;Macintosh System Software 2.0.1&quot;.

== Hardware ==

Processor: Motorola 68000, 8 MHz, with an 8 MHz system bus and a 16-bit data path

RAM: The SE came with 1 MB of RAM as standard, and is expandable to 4 MB. The logic board has four 30-pin SIMM slots; memory must be installed in pairs and must be 150 ns or faster.

Video: The built-in 512 × 342 monochrome screen uses 21,888 bytes of main memory as video memory.

Storage: The SE can accommodate either one or two floppy drives, or a floppy drive and a hard drive. After-market brackets were designed to allow the SE to accommodate two floppy drives as well as a hard drive; however, this was not a configuration supported by Apple. In addition, an external floppy disk drive may also be connected, making the SE the only Macintosh besides the Macintosh Portable which could support three floppy drives, though its increased storage, RAM capacity and optional internal hard drive rendered the external drives less of a necessity than for its predecessors. Single-floppy SE models also featured a drive-access light in the spot where the second floppy drive would be. Hard-drive equipped models came with a 20 MB SCSI hard disk.

Battery: A 3.6 V 1/2AA lithium battery, which must be present in order for basic settings to persist between power cycles, is located on the logic board. Macintosh SE machines which have sat for a long time have experienced battery corrosion and leakage, resulting in a damaged case and logic board. Some SE models feature a board-mounted battery holder, while others have the battery soldered directly in place.

Expansion: A Processor Direct Slot on the logic board allows for expansion cards, such as accelerators, to be installed. The SE can be upgraded to 50 MHz and more than 5 MB with the MicroMac accelerators. In the past other accelerators were also available such as the Sonnet Allegro. Since installing a card required opening the computer&#x27;s case and exposing the user to high voltages from the internal CRT, Apple recommended that only authorized Apple dealers install the cards; the case was sealed with then-uncommon Torx screws.

Upgrades: After Apple introduced the Macintosh SE/30 in January, 1989, a logic board upgrade was sold by Apple dealers for US$1,699 as a high-cost upgrade for the SE, consisting of a new SE/30 motherboard, case front and internal chassis to accommodate the upgrade components.

ROM/Easter egg: The SE ROM size increased from 64 KB in the original Mac (and 128 KB in the Mac Plus) to 256 KB, which allowed the development team to include an Easter Egg hidden in the ROMs. By jumping to address 0x41D89A (or reading from the ROM chips), it is possible to display four images of the engineering team.

== Models ==
Introduced March 2, 1987:
* Macintosh SE with 1 MB RAM and two 800k drives
* Macintosh SE 1/20 with 1 MB RAM, one 800k drive and 20 MB hard disk.
Introduced August 1, 1988:
* Macintosh SE 1/40: The same of the Macintosh SE with a 40 MB hard disk in place of 20 MB.
Introduced August 1, 1989:
* Macintosh SE FDHD: Includes the new SuperDrive, a floppy disk drive that can handle 1.4 MB High Density (HD) floppy disks. FDHD is an initialism for &quot;Floppy Disk High Density&quot;; later some Macintosh SE FDHDs were labeled Macintosh SE SuperDrive, to conform to Apple&#x27;s marketing change with respect to their new drive. High-density floppies would become the de facto standard on both the Macintosh and PC computers from then on. An upgrade kit was sold for the original Macintosh SE which included new ROM chips and a new disk controller chip, to replace the originals.

<text>Patricia Arquette (born April 8, 1968) is an American actress. She made her feature film debut as Kristen Parker in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987) and has since received several awards, including an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards.

Arquette had starring roles in several critically acclaimed films, including &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993), &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot; (1996), &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997), &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot; (1998), &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (1999), and &quot;Holes&quot; (2003). From 2005 to 2011, she starred as a character based on the medium Allison DuBois in the supernatural drama series &quot;Medium&quot;, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2005.

For playing a single mother in the coming-of-age film &quot;Boyhood&quot; (2014), which was filmed from 2002 until 2014, Arquette won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For her role as a prison worker in the miniseries &quot;Escape at Dannemora&quot; (2018) and as Dee Dee Blanchard in the miniseries &quot;The Act&quot; (2019), she won Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress for &quot;The Act&quot;. She starred in the Apple TV+ thriller series &quot;Severance&quot; (2022–present).

==Early life and family==

Arquette was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1968 to Lewis Arquette, an actor and puppeteer, and Brenda Olivia &quot;Mardi&quot; (née Nowak), who was involved in the arts and worked as a therapist. Through her father, Patricia is distantly related to explorer Meriwether Lewis. Arquette&#x27;s father had converted from Catholicism to Islam. Arquette&#x27;s mother was Jewish, and her ancestors emigrated from Poland and Russia.
Her father&#x27;s family&#x27;s surname was originally &quot;Arcouet&quot;, and his paternal line was of French-Canadian descent. Her paternal grandfather was comedian Cliff Arquette. Patricia&#x27;s siblings also became actors: Rosanna, Richmond, Alexis, and David. When she was a child, her parents offered to get her braces for her teeth, but she refused, claiming she didn&#x27;t want to look perfect and &quot;it didn&#x27;t feel like it would fit who I was inside.&quot;

For a time her family lived on a commune in rural Bentonville, Virginia. She has said they became poorer the longer they lived there and she believes that experience enlarged her empathy. Her father was an alcoholic; her mother was violently abusive. When Arquette was seven, the family relocated to Chicago. They later settled in Los Angeles, California. Arquette attended Catholic school, and has said that when she was a teenager, she had wanted to be a nun.
At the age of 14, Arquette ran away from home after learning her father was having an affair—she settled with her sister, Rosanna Arquette, in Los Angeles. She has described her father as a working actor for industrial films, commercials and voiceovers – he was best known for his role as J.D. Pickett in the TV series &quot;The Waltons&quot;. Before pursuing a career in acting, Arquette had wanted to be a midwife.
She put this career prospect aside briefly in an attempt to gain acting jobs and gained success in the industry.

==Career==

===1987–1996: Early career and breakthrough===
In 1987, Arquette&#x27;s first starring roles included pregnant teenager Stacy in the television film &quot;Daddy&quot;, boarding school student Zero in &quot;Pretty Smart&quot;, and Kristen Parker in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;, alongside Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson. She reprised her role as Kristen in the music video to Dokken&#x27;s &quot;Dream Warriors&quot; (1987). She was asked to reprise her role in the sequel, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot; (1988), but she declined the offer in order to do other projects. She gave up the role of Tralala in &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; due to her pregnancy with her son Enzo.

In 1988, Arquette played the daughter of Tess Harper in &quot;Far North&quot;. Her roles in the early 1990s were in low budget and independent films, including &quot;Prayer of the Rollerboys&quot; (1990) as love interest of Corey Haim&#x27;s character, &quot;The Indian Runner&quot; (1991), which was the directorial debut of Sean Penn; and the drama &quot;Inside Monkey Zetterland&quot;. In 1992, she won a CableACE Award for Best Lead Actress in a Mini-Series for her portrayal of a deaf girl with epilepsy in &quot;Wildflower&quot;, directed by Diane Keaton and also starring Reese Witherspoon.

In her early career, Arquette received the most recognition for her role as Alabama Whitman, a free-spirited, kind-hearted prostitute in Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993). The film was a moderate box office success but became a cultural landmark because of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s screenplay, which preceded &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, although some critics were deterred by the graphic violence. In one scene, Arquette puts up a fierce physical struggle in a fight with James Gandolfini (as a viciously sadistic killer) which her character ultimately wins. Arquette&#x27;s performance received unanimous praise from critics. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that Arquette played her role with &quot;surprising sweetness&quot;, while Peter Travers remarked that &quot;Arquette delivers sensationally&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; noted that the film blends and recycles elements from the story of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;love on the run&quot; film &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973). It gave &quot;True Romance&quot; overall a favourable review for having &quot;enough energy and verve to create something entirely fresh and infectiously entertaining&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; made similar statements and also likened the film to the earlier, seminal &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;.

Arquette next appeared in the television film &quot;Betrayed by Love&quot; (1994), and the well-received biopic &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, where she portrayed his girlfriend. Her next role was as Laura Bowman in John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Rangoon&quot; (1995), which drew mixed critical reviews, but was a success internationally. In France, it was the official selection at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, where it became one of the most popular hits of the event. Although the film had lackluster reviews, Arquette&#x27;s performance as an American tourist in Burma during the 8888 Uprising was regarded as one of the work&#x27;s strong points. Michael Sragow, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, stated &quot;Arquette gives the kind of mighty physical performance usually delivered by men in existential action classics like &quot;The Wages of Fear,&quot; but she suffuses it with something all her own - she&#x27;s bulletproof yet vulnerable.&quot; Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; remarked that the film was &quot;odd, brilliant in places, but frustrating all the same,&quot; commenting that &quot;Arquette shows real grit when the chips are down&quot;.

Arquette appeared in three films in 1996, the first the comedy film &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot; (1996), about a young man&#x27;s cross-country pursuit to find his parents. Critical reception was largely positive, with Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; praising the film and the authenticity of Arquette&#x27;s performance, highlighting that &quot;Arquette [is] very believably distracted and infuriated&quot;. &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot; grossed $14 million at the American box office and was screened in the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. Her second film released that year was the period drama &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s 1907 novel of the same name. The film received average reviews. &quot;Infinity&quot; was her third film that year, a biographical drama about the early life of American physicist Richard Feynman. The film received mixed to positive reviews. Although Emmanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; said that Arquette was &quot;miscast&quot;, he stated that she &quot;registers more credibly in the first part of the film, when she plays an adolescent&quot;.

===1997–2003: Independent film work and critical success===
In 1997, Arquette starred in David Lynch&#x27;s neo-noir psychological thriller &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, in dual roles as Renee Madison and Alice Wakefield. The film had an ambiguous narrative, which polarized audiences and drew varying critical opinion, but it established a strong cult following. Arquette played an elusive femme fatale in a critically revered performance that enabled her to draw on her sexuality more than any other previous role. Roger Ebert, of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, disliked the film, saying there was &quot;no sense to be made of it&quot; and voiced his distaste over a scene in which Arquette&#x27;s character is asked to disrobe at gunpoint. Other critics were more favourable: Andy Klein of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; called it a &quot;two-hour plus fever dream&quot;, Michael Sragow of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film a &quot;compelling erotic nightmare&quot;, and Edward Guthman of the &quot;San Francisco Gate&quot; wrote a glowing review praising Arquette&#x27;s performance, calling it the &quot;strongest, most memorable performance [of the film]&quot; and favourably comparing her double role to Kim Novak&#x27;s in &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958). That same year, Arquette appeared in &quot;Nightwatch&quot;, a horror-thriller film directed by Ole Bornedal. The film is a remake the Danish film &quot;Nattevagten&quot; (1994), which was also directed by Bornedal. &quot;Nightwatch&quot; was not a box office success and received poor reviews by critics, many of whom considered it an unnecessary, inferior retelling of the original film.
In 1998, Arquette performed in two films: &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, a comedic neo-noir directed by Roland Joffé and &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot;, a period Western directed by Stephen Frears. The former received a poor critical reception while the latter received a more appreciative albeit modest response. &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot; was widely cited as a &quot;classic Western&quot; in the press. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;In its best moments the movie feels like an epic hybrid of Red River and The Last Picture Show.&quot; In 1999, Arquette returned to familiar territory with the genre that began her career, in &quot;Stigmata&quot;, a horror film, in the lead role. Produced on a budget of $29 million, the film was a box office success, grossing $50,046,268. Internationally the film earned $39,400,000 for a total worldwide gross $89,446,268. Critics were not as receptive of the film as audiences, with Roger Ebert remarking &quot;possibly the funniest movie ever made about Catholicism – from a theological point of view&quot;. Arquette then appeared in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Bringing out the Dead&quot;, based on the novel by Joe Connelly. The film united her with then-husband Nicolas Cage and received highly favourable critical reviews, but was a box office flop. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Arquette&#x27;s quietly credible performance helps center Frank&#x27;s experiences; one of the film&#x27;s most honest scenes is one in which they share an ambulance ride without sharing a word&quot;.

Her next role was in the light-hearted comedy &quot;Little Nicky&quot; (2000), alongside Adam Sandler. Despite being a box office hit, the film received negative reviews, although Roger Ebert called it Sandler&#x27;s best film to date. Following this, she starred in French-American comedy drama &quot;Human Nature&quot; (2001), written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Michel Gondry. The film was met with mixed reviews and was screened out of competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Roger Ebert, in a three-star (out of a possible four) review, lauded the film&#x27;s &quot;screwball charm&quot;. The following year, she appeared in the small-scale mystery film &quot;The Badge&quot;, playing the widow of a murdered transsexual woman. In 2003, she portrayed the controversial pornographic film star Linda Lovelace in the little known &quot;Deeper than Deep&quot;, which was followed with the more family orientated Disney produced &quot;Holes&quot;, as Kissin&#x27; Kate Barlow. Based on the 1998 novel of the same title by Louis Sachar, &quot;Holes&quot; grossed $16,300,155 in its opening weekend, making #2 at the box office, behind &quot;Anger Management&quot;″s second weekend. &quot;Holes&quot; would go on to gross a domestic total of $67,406,173 and an additional $4 million in international revenue, totaling $71,406,573 at the box office against a $20 million budget, making the film a moderate financial success. Arquette&#x27;s next film, &quot;Tiptoes&quot;, was released straight-to-DVD in the United States, despite a screening at the Sundance Film Festival.

===2004–2014: Further acclaim with &quot;Medium&quot; and &quot;Boyhood&quot;===
After the humdrum reception of &quot;Tiptoes&quot;, Arquette did not appear in another film until 2006&#x27;s &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, directed by Richard Linklater. During these three years, she was largely working on &quot;Boyhood&quot;; it was released eight years later in July 2014. &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; marked her second collaboration with Linklater; it is based on the bestselling 2001 non-fiction book of the same name by Eric Schlosser. &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; received mixed to positive critical reviews. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded the film three out of four stars and added, &quot;It&#x27;s less an exposé of junk-food culture than a human drama, sprinkled with sly, provoking wit, about how that culture defines how we live ... The film is brimming with grand ambitions but trips on many of them as some characters aren&#x27;t given enough screen time to register and others vanish just when you want to learn more about them.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;It&#x27;s a mirror and a portrait, and a movie as necessary and nourishing as your next meal.&quot;
In January 2005, Arquette made her first transition to television with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Medium&quot;. Her role as (a fictional version of) psychic medium Allison DuBois won her an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in 2005, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe in 2005, 2006 and 2007, a SAG Award in 2006, 2007 and 2010, and an Emmy Award in 2007. In 2009 NBC cancelled &quot;Medium&quot;, then CBS picked the series up and it lasted another two seasons. In 2008, she provided voice work for &quot;A Single Woman&quot;, which was panned. She did not appear in another film until 2012. &quot;Girl in Progress&quot;, a drama directed by Patricia Riggen, marked her return; it was met with negative reviews. In 2013, she returned to television, appearing on &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; as Sally Wheet. Also in 2013, Arquette filmed the true crime drama &quot;Electric Slide&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Boyhood&quot; was released, a project that Arquette and other actors had shot for 12 years beginning in 2002. The film was directed by Richard Linklater, marking his second collaboration with Arquette. In the film, she plays Olivia Evans, a single mother who raises her two children mostly alone with the sometimes assistance of their father (played by Ethan Hawke). The epic explores a 12-year scope. The film details the progression of her character&#x27;s son, Mason, from ages eight to 18. The film has received universal praise, with many critics calling it a &quot;landmark film&quot;. Arquette received widespread acclaim for her performance. Critic Katie McDonahugh, writing for &quot;Salon&quot;, states &quot;the role gave [Arquette] space to be all of these messy things at once, and her performance was a raw, gutsy meditation on those profoundly human contradictions&quot;. Margaret Pomeranz, writing for &quot;ABC Australia&quot;, called Arquette&#x27;s performance &quot;stunning&quot; and praised the film, further remarking that &quot;the elision from one time to another is subtle and seamless. It&#x27;s just a fabulous movie experience&quot;. Arquette won the Academy Award, BAFTA, Critics&#x27; Choice, Golden Globe, Independent Spirit, and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actress.

===2015–present: Continued success and recent roles===
In early 2015, Arquette began starring in the CBS series &quot;&quot;, a show about FBI agents who combat Internet-based crimes. On May 12, 2016, CBS canceled the series after two seasons, thus ending the &quot;CSI&quot; franchise.

Arquette portrayed Tilly Mitchell in the Ben Stiller-directed Showtime miniseries &quot;Escape at Dannemora&quot;, which premiered on November 18, 2018. For the role, she gained weight, wore prosthetic teeth, and brown contact lenses. For her performance, she received critical acclaim and won the SAG Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award, and Golden Globe Award. She also received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

In 2018, it was announced that Arquette would be starring in the Hulu series &quot;The Act&quot;. The series premiered in March 2019 to critical acclaim. For her performance, Arquette received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. In 2022, Arquette began co-starring in the Apple TV+ thriller series &quot;Severance&quot;, also directed by Stiller. The series has received critical acclaim.

==Personal life==
At age 20, Arquette had a relationship with Paul Rossi, a musician. They had a son together, Enzo Rossi, born on January 3, 1989. In April 1995, Arquette married Nicolas Cage (with whom she later co-starred in &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; in 1999). They separated after nine months, but acted as a couple in public until Cage filed for divorce in February 2000. 

Arquette and actor Thomas Jane became engaged in 2002. Their daughter Harlow Olivia Calliope Jane was born on February 20, 2003. Arquette and Jane married on June 25, 2006, at the Palazzo Contarini in Venice, Italy. In January 2009, Arquette filed for divorce from Jane on the grounds of irreconcilable differences, but the couple soon reconciled. Arquette withdrew the divorce petition on July 9, 2009. On August 13, 2010, Jane&#x27;s representative announced that Arquette and Jane had decided to proceed with a divorce due to &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. The divorce was finalized on July 1, 2011, and the two agreed to joint custody of their child.

Arquette was in a relationship with painter Eric White since at least 2014. In January 2025, Arquette said that she had been single for almost two years. 

==Advocacy==
After the Haiti earthquake in 2010, Arquette and childhood friend Rosetta Millington-Getty formed GiveLove, a non-profit organization supporting ecological sanitation and composting, community development projects and housing construction in Haiti.

In 1997, after her mother died of breast cancer, Arquette worked to raise awareness about the disease. She has run in the annual Race for the Cure. In 1999 she was the spokesperson for Lee National Denim Day, which raises millions of dollars for breast cancer research and education.

In April 2010, she teamed up with welding students of the Robert Morgan Educational Center in Miami, Florida, to build shelters in Haiti from 20 used shipping containers, to provide housing to people displaced by the earthquake.

Arquette participated in the 2017 Women&#x27;s March against President Donald Trump.

<text>An Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program provides funding and/or credit to undergraduate students who volunteer for faculty-mentored research projects pertaining to all academic disciplines.

==Participating universities==
Universities involved include the University of Hawaii, The University of Queensland, Boston University, the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), the University of California, Irvine, California State University, Long Beach, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Michigan, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), the University of Minnesota, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the RWTH Aachen University, Imperial College London, the University of New Hampshire, and the Nanyang Technological University.

==Founding and purpose==
The MIT program was founded in 1969, and the program at the University of Michigan was founded in the 1989 (primarily to help minorities and women break into science and mathematics). The University of California, Irvine founded its program in 1995. In the United Kingdom, Imperial College London provides a program for doing research in most of its departments for undergraduates at Imperial. Furthermore, the UROP scheme is also available at the University of Cambridge, the University of Reading, the University of Essex and the National University of Singapore. In 2008 the RWTH Aachen University started the first international UROP program for students from the United States and Canada in Germany. The University of Sussex runs a similar scheme, across all of its departments, where undergraduates are funded for 6 weeks as Junior Research Associates. The California State University, Long Beach program does not serve transfer students.

==Calls==
Students can apply for funding by submitting a proposal during &quot;Calls for Proposals&quot;, which occur throughout the school year.

The Calls are announced on the school web sites and distributed to faculty members and the undergraduate counseling offices. Students have approximately one month from the announcement to submit their proposals. All undergraduate students from all disciplines and majors who are participating in a research project with a faculty advisor (usually a full-time professor at the university) eligible to respond to the current Call for Proposals if they are in good academic standing with the school.
==Proposals==
Proposals are prepared by the student applicant and jointly submitted by the student and the faculty advisors. UROP funds a variety of projects with grants depending upon the merits of the project. At UC Irvine, an individual student may receive up to $1,000 through UROP for projects during the school year, to help pay for supplies and other necessary materials. Alternatively, UC Irvine students may also apply for a prestigious summer fellowship, by which they may be awarded as much as $3,000 per project, which is meant to reward them for their time and efforts. Higher amounts may be awarded for group projects. The UROP Faculty Advisory Board reviews proposals and decides whether the project merits funding. The UROP Faculty Advisory Board also makes the funding recommendations.

==Completion and submission==
Upon completion of the year-long research project, students are expected to present their findings at the school&#x27;s research symposium. Although not a requirement, some students may submit their written reports (ranging from 15-25 pages) to the faculty committee in order to be considered for publication in the university&#x27;s research journals. Publication in the UROP undergraduate research journal is known to be extremely competitive. In many cases, students are asked to submit numerous drafts to the faculty committee for review, only to find out that their papers are later denied publication. In the past, a mere 5% of all submissions were accepted for publication in the UC Irvine and MIT journals.

<doc id="400609" wikidata="Q5287618" url="?curid=400609" title="Document-based question">
<text>In American Advanced Placement exams, a document-based question (DBQ), also known as data-based question, is an essay or series of short-answer questions that is constructed by students using one&#x27;s own knowledge combined with support from several provided sources. Usually, it is employed on timed history tests. 
== In the United States ==
The document based question was first used for the 1973 AP United States History Exam published by the College Board, created as a joint effort between Development Committee members Reverend Giles Hayes and Stephen Klein. Both were unhappy with student performance on free-response essays, and often found that students were &quot;groping for half-remembered information&quot; and &quot;parroted factual information with little historical analysis or argument&quot; when they wrote their essays. The goal of the Document Based Question was for students to be &quot;less concerned with the recall of previously learned information&quot; and more engaged in deeper historical inquiry. Hayes, in particular, hoped students would &quot;become junior historians and play the role of historians for that hour&quot; as they engaged in the DBQ. 

A typical DBQ is a packet of several original sources (anywhere from three to sixteen), labeled by letters (beginning with &quot;Document A&quot; or &quot;Source A&quot;) or numbers. Usually all but one or two source(s) are textual, with the other source(s) being graphic (usually a political cartoon, map, or poster if primary and a chart or graph if secondary). In most cases, the sources are selected to provide different perspectives or views on the events or movements being analyzed.

On the Advanced Placement (AP) exams, only primary sources are provided; on the International Baccalaureate (IB) exams, both primary and secondary sources are provided. AP exams also require students to construct and defend a thesis based on one prompt, while IB exams focus on a series of questions, with at least one asking students to assess the &quot;value and limitations&quot; of a source, usually &quot;with reference to the documents&#x27; origin or purpose.&quot;

The documents contained in the document-based questions are rarely familiar texts (for example, the Emancipation Proclamation and Declaration of Independence are not likely to be on a U.S. history test), though the documents&#x27; authors may be major historical figures. The documents vary in length and format.

On some tests students are not permitted to begin responding to the question or questions in the essay packet until after a mandatory reading time (&quot;planning period&quot;), usually around 10 to 15 minutes. During this time, students read the passage and, if desired, make notes or markings. After this period, students are permitted to respond, usually for around 45 minutes to an hour.

<text>Professor Frank McGuinness (born 1953) is an Irish writer. As well as his own plays, which include &quot;The Factory Girls&quot;, &quot;Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme&quot;, &quot;Someone Who&#x27;ll Watch Over Me&quot; and &quot;Dolly West&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, he is recognised for a &quot;strong record of adapting literary classics, having translated the plays of Racine, Sophocles, Ibsen, Garcia Lorca, and Strindberg to critical acclaim&quot;. He has also published six collections of poetry, and two novels. McGuinness was Professor of Creative Writing at University College Dublin (UCD) from 2007 to 2018.

==Biography==
McGuinness was born in Buncrana, a town located on the Inishowen Peninsula of County Donegal, Ireland. He was educated locally and at University College Dublin, where he studied Pure English and medieval studies to postgraduate level.

He first came to prominence with his play &quot;The Factory Girls&quot;, but established his reputation with his play about World War I, &quot;Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme&quot;, which was staged in Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre and internationally. The play made a name for him when it was performed at Hampstead Theatre, drawing comments about McGuinness&#x27;s Irish Catholic background. It won numerous awards including the London Evening Standard &quot;Award for Most Promising Playwright&quot; for McGuinness and the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize. He has also written new versions of classic dramas, including works by Henrik Ibsen, Anton Chekhov, and Euripides, adapting the literal translations of others. In addition, he wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;, adapting the stage play by fellow Ulsterman Brian Friel.

McGuinness&#x27;s first poetry anthology, &quot;Booterstown&quot;, was published in 1994. Several of his poems have been recorded by Marianne Faithfull, including &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;After the Ceasefire&quot; and &quot;The Wedding&quot;.

McGuinness previously lectured in Linguistics and Drama at the University of Ulster, Medieval Studies at University College, Dublin and English at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. Then he was a writer-in-residence lecturing at University College Dublin before being appointed Professor of Creative Writing in the School of English, Drama and Film there.

==Original plays==
Frank McGuinness has explained, &quot;My earliest writing was … song lyrics. I would have loved to have been … Paul McCartney … Joni Mitchell&quot;. Desiring to write something &quot;substantial&quot;, however, he &quot;tossed a coin&quot; between a play and a novel, and decided to write a play. &quot;The Glass God&quot;, a one-act play written by McGuinness for the company Platform Group Theatre, was premiered at the Lourdes Hall Theatre in Dublin in 1982. It was one of three one-act plays presented under the collective title of &quot;Shrapnel&quot;.

McGuinness&#x27; first full-length play, &quot;The Factory Girls&quot;, also premiered in 1982, and dealt with a group of female workers facing redundancy from a small town in Donegal. McGuinness explained that he was inspired by &quot;the women in my family&quot;. A critic has highlighted its &quot;Wednesday to Sunday time frame&quot;, in a link to Catholic imagery which, surprisingly given its theme, indicates that this is in fact &quot;a passion play&quot;. &quot;When I wrote &#x27;The Factory Girls&#x27;,&quot; McGuiness has explained, &quot;I desperately wanted to bring across the audience a sense that I came from a sophisticated background, [because] I come from a background where language is very dangerous, where language is very layered.&quot;

McGuinness&#x27; second play, &quot;Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching towards the Somme&quot;, was first staged in 1985. The play, about a group of Protestant soldiers in the First World War, was not primarily political in intent, but, according to the playwright, was originally inspired by &quot;a great story&quot;. &quot;Observe the Sons of Ulster&quot; has been described as &quot;a theater of ghosts&quot;, a play where &quot;a community is figured as spectral&quot;.

The play which followed, &quot;Innocence&quot;, dealt with the painter Caravaggio. It took its name from one of his paintings, &quot;The Sacrifice of Isaak&quot;, about the Biblical story of the father whose faith is tested by God&#x27;s request that he kill his son. In the painting, a sheep watches the sacrifice about to take place and looks appalled at human cruelty, its innocence shattered. McGuinness was inspired by &quot;this innocent sheep&quot; who, at the end of the story, will be sacrificed instead of the child. &quot;Only Caravaggio would remember the sheep&quot; in the story, McGuinness says.

His next play, &quot;Carthaginians&quot;, premiered in 1989, was concerned with the Bloody Sunday events in Northern Ireland. In 1972, in Derry, British soldiers shot unarmed civilians who were taking part in a march against internment and killed 14 people. McGuinness has described Carthaginians as &quot;My play on the Catholic imagination …&quot;, stating that &quot;the keyword in [the play] is the word &#x27;perhaps&#x27;&quot;. It has been claimed that &quot;Carthaginians&quot; should be placed primarily &quot;within a body of translations and adaptations of ancient Greek tragedy in the Irish theatre of the 1980s and 1990s&quot;. A number of critics have suggested that Ibsen is the main influence in the plays of McGuinness, something corroborated by the writer himself, who has also explained that &quot;... there is of course another influence, that of Shakespeare...&quot;. It was this influence that triggered the composition of &quot;Carthaginians&quot; and &quot;Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching towards the Somme&quot;. In the author&#x27;s own words: &quot;I decided, right, let&#x27;s grab the unicorn by the horn, and see what happens&quot;. McGuinness has declared that he had &quot;wanted to construct a five-act Shakespearean play&quot;, and to use &quot;narrative in a way that I hope no one had done before&quot;. He has described the play as &quot;a big brute&quot;, adding that, among his works to date, &quot;I suspect &#x27;this play will last&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;Someone Who&#x27;ll Watch Over Me&quot;, first staged in 1992, is a play about the 1986 Lebanon hostage crisis. It is in effect a tragi-comedy which explores the relationship between three hostages, one American, one Irish and one English. Despite their contrasting backgrounds and beliefs the play soon erodes away their differences and brings to the fore the shared humanity that they rely on in order to cope with the horrors and uncertainties of their incarceration. In his introduction to Frank McGuinness: Plays 2 (a collection of plays which included &quot;Mary and Lizzie&quot;, &quot;Someone Who&#x27;ll Watch Over Me&quot;, &quot;Dolly West&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; and &quot;The Bird Sanctuary&quot;) McGuinness explains, &quot;At their hearts&#x27; core these plays centre around rituals and the need to disrupt ritual. […] In their tee-total captivity, Edward, Michael and Adam throw a wild party, somehow knowing that it&#x27;s a wake. After these engagements, nothing will be the same. Comedy thrives on change. I suppose these plays are about change. Are they comedies? When they want to be.&quot;

The play &quot;Dolly West&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, premiered in 1999, is set during the Second World War in Buncrana. This time was euphemistically referred to in the Republic of Ireland as &quot;The Emergency&quot;. McGuinness has explained that the arrival of US troops into the town of Buncrana was not only an invasion in terms of the military presence, but also an &quot;invasion of sexuality&quot;, as the soldiers made quite an impression in the town. But the main theme in the play &quot;… was to do with a gigantic sorrow in my life, which is that my mother died&quot;. This was the heart of the story, because, McGuinness explained, when the mother dies, &quot;the children have to grow up&quot;.

The play &quot;Gates of Gold&quot;, premiered in 2002, was commissioned by The Gate Theatre in Dublin to celebrate its anniversary. The theatre was founded by Micheál Mac Liammóir and Hilton Edwards, who were lifelong partners in life and work, and the play is about them. McGuinness, who is himself gay and whose plays often contain gay relationships or explore more traditional family drama from an outsider&#x27;s perspective, has explained that he &quot;wanted to write a play that was a great celebration of homosexual marriage, love, partnership&quot;. The playwright has a drawing of MacLiammoir, by Norah McGuinness, in his sitting room, a work &quot;which I bought with the royalties of the &quot;Factory Girls&quot;&quot;, so the actor is literally a constant presence in McGuinness&#x27; life. &quot;Gates of Gold&quot; looks at the dying days of MacLiammoir, because McGuinness wanted to write &quot;something darker and stranger&quot;, and less predictable, about these two pioneers of theatre.

Premiered in 2007, &quot;There Came a Gipsy Riding&quot; asks the question of &quot;how do you survive the greatest loss, the loss of a child...&quot;, to conclude that &quot;you don&#x27;t recover, but you do learn to live with it&quot;. A critic summarised this &quot;impressive drama&quot; as &quot;a concentrated piece that intricately dissects a middle-class family at war with itself following the suicide of one of their three children&quot;.

The play &quot;The Hanging Gardens&quot;, premiered in 2007, is concerned with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and the devastating effect it has on its sufferers and the people around them. McGuinness explained that: &quot;I hope the audience laughs. And that they&#x27;re shocked. I try to give them something more than they expect.&quot; One reviewer declared that the play &quot;holds us, moves us, alarms us.&quot;

==Adaptation==
McGuinness is as well known for his play adaptations as for his original plays. He has adapted classics by Sophocles, Jean Racine, Henrik Ibsen, Molière, Valle-Inclan, Federico García Lorca, as well as short works by Strindberg and Pirandello, a short story by James Joyce, and novels by Stoker and Du Maurier. His ability to distil the raw force from classic Greek drama, in particular, has been noted by critics. He sometimes takes noticeable liberties in his adaptations, in order to strengthen characterisation—for example by making the alienated protagonist of &quot;Rebecca&quot; into an Anglo-Irish woman from a once privileged family—or to underline the theme of the play—for example in &quot;Rebecca&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve invented a scene in which Mrs Danvers confronts Max and says, &#x27;You loved her, but she didn&#x27;t love you&#x27;&quot;, or in &quot;Barbaric Comedies&quot;, a play about a world of amoral grotesquerie, he added a sexual assault scene. Some of these liberties have been controversial. By and large, McGuinness&#x27; adaptations have been hailed as reworkings that &quot;breath[e] life&quot; into the originals.

==Poetry==
Frank McGuinness began his writing career as a poet. As a university student, he has explained, &quot;I sent some poems to the &#x27;Irish Press&#x27; and the wonderful [general editor] David Marcus wrote back to me saying [&#x27;]I&#x27;m going to publish them[&#x27;], and &#x27;You are a writer&#x27;. He didn&#x27;t know what he was unleashing but that was the beginning really. A terrific thing to say when you&#x27;re 20 or 21. And I went from there&quot;. &#x27;Booterstown&#x27; (1994), is rooted in the town of the same name; &#x27;The Stone Jug&#x27; (2003) is a sequence of sixty sonnets; &#x27;Dulse&#x27; (2008), takes its name from a Latin word meaning &#x27;sweet&#x27;, which is also the name of an edible seaweed used in Ireland. Broadly, McGuinness poetic style is characterised by the use of clear solid unrhymed lines designed to echo in the mind of the listener or reader. The poems often seek to organise emotion, and sometimes represent probing psychological sketches. They are concerned with relationships, events, and the significance of the everyday. The poems are snapshots, often inspired by personal experience, but sometimes created to supplement or assist in delineating fictional characters for his plays. One critic has claimed that McGuinness&#x27;s poetic work is characterised by its &quot;reliance on dramatic monologue and on intense lyricism&quot;. The Memorial Garden at University College Dublin, designed in a circular shape, features a carved stone with a short poem written by Frank McGuinness for the site: &quot;This silence is round / So is remembrance, / they say&quot;.

==Fiction==
Frank McGuinness&#x27; first novel, &quot;Arimathea&quot;, was published in 2013. It has been described as &quot;[a] story of salvation&quot;. The book is set in a village in Donegal in 1950, registering the effect of the arrival of an Italian painter who &quot;came from out foreign and … spoke wild funny&quot;. The story, told from the point of view of various characters, is inspired by a historic Italian artist who was commissioned to paint the Stations of the Cross in the catholic church of Buncrana in the 1900s. McGuinness wrote the book as research for his play The Hanging Gardens, but never thought it would be published as a novel. The story of the play deals with a novelist who contracts Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and progressively loses control of his mind; in order to understand the character better, McGuinness decided to try to write a novel that that man could have written, and the result was &quot;Arimathea&quot;. In addition to this piece of work, McGuinness also conducted other research for the play, by interviewing people with experience of elderly parents being affected by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. 
While one reviewer claimed that &quot;there is nothing like [this novel] in the history of Irish fiction&quot;, another stated that Arimathea is &quot;a distinctively Irish book, and one in which echoes of Joyce vie with those of Máirtín Ó Cadhain&quot;. Many commentators pointed out that this choral novel, told in a series of monologues, makes good use of Frank McGuinness&#x27; experience in the theatre, including his ability to render individualised voices. His background as a poet may also have been relevant to &quot;Arimathea&quot;″s investment in suggestion as a method and silence as an idea. &quot;[T]he final effect&quot; of the novel, as one reviewer put it, &quot;is to lead the reader to consider those voices not yet heard, and the private agonies that are never shared&quot;.

Frank McGuinness&#x27; second novel, &quot;The Woodcutter and His Family&quot;, published in September 2017, deals with the last days of James Joyce in Zurich. The novel is made of four sections, monologues from James, his partner Nora, their daughter Lucia, and son Giorgio, who are given the names of characters from Joyce&#x27;s play &quot;Exiles&quot;. At the book launch, Joycean scholar professor Anne Fogarty spoke of her surprise at opening the book to meet the voice of Giorgio Joyce, a figure neglected by Joycean scholars. Fogarty said that McGuinness&#x27; novel has &quot;liberated&quot; the Joyce family from historiographers and biographers, and described the book as &quot;wise and witty&quot;. At the launch, Frank McGuinness explained that he fell under the spell of Joyce as a young man, when he heard Joni Mitchel read out the opening one and a half pages from the novel &#x27;Portrait of the Artist&#x27;. McGuinness also said that he was aware, in taking on the project of a novel about the Joyces, that he was &quot;putting my head into a zoo-worth of lions&#x27; mouths&quot;, but that this would not stop him. &quot;The Woodcutter and His Family&quot; is notable also because it deliberately changes historical facts. While focusing on the Joyce family, the book also includes a portrait of the Irish playwright Samuel Beckett, a friend of the Joyces.

==Short fiction==
McGuinness has published a number of short stories. The short story &quot;Paprika&quot;, from 2014, appeared in a collection of new stories by Irish writers. &quot;Paprika&quot; is a tale of murder, centered on a disgruntled, mentally unstable operatic white tenor, who is currently playing the role of Othello in an opera, wearing blackface. The story is told through &quot;the pompous voice&quot; of the protagonist, &quot;who veers between grandiosity and despair&quot;. Structured as a fluid but self-conscious monologue, the piece has various levels of association, including a subversion ─or an update─ of the plot of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;, an investigation on the performance of identity, and a dissection of the &#x27;logic&#x27; of inequality, and employing &quot;[t]he shards of childhood&quot;, to &quot;pierce the narrative in an unusual and thought-provoking [way].&quot;

In 2018, McGuinness published his first collection of short fiction, &quot;Paprika&quot;, consisting of twelve stories. It is published by Brandon, an imprint of The O&#x27;Brien Press in Dublin. The stories have been described as &quot;uproarious and outrageous, [tending] to depict insecure, unhinged individuals who find themselves on the wrong side of a comfortable life. A startling collection&quot;

==Opera==
Frank McGuinness&#x27;s first opera libretto was &quot;Thebans&quot;, produced in 2014 at the English National Opera in London. The opera is a version of the trilogy of plays by Sophocles. He was invited to write the libretto by composer Julian Anderson. Adapting this substantial body of work onto a single story 100 minutes long was a considerable challenge. Recalling his initial conversations with the composer, McGuinness explained: &quot;The first thing I said was: I know it will have to be much, much shorter. We looked at a two-page speech. &quot;I can get this down to six lines,&quot; I told him – and then did just that.&quot; The Theban trilogy, comprising &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, and &quot;Antigone&quot;, has been occasionally performed as a chronologically ordered, three-play show. For his version, McGuinness made the decision to change the traditional order in the story. He explained that &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought that putting [the play Antigone] at the end of the evening short-changes it remarkably. Although it&#x27;s the final part of the trilogy, it never feels like the end; in fact, it almost feels as if it were by a different writer.&quot; While some critics did not approve of the switch, they still described the opera as &quot;distinctly impressive&quot;.

McGuinness&#x27; priority in producing the libretto was to make the original text accessible to a contemporary audience. &quot;I&#x27;m trying to make this accessible&quot;, McGuinness declared, &quot;and to write as beautiful a text as I can for the singers to sing. And that is what I think they are, these stories that have haunted us: they are something beautiful, something brutal, and the beauty and brutality confound each other.&quot; The original trilogy is &quot;revered as a foundational document of western civilisation&quot;, and one of the main achievements of this &quot;dazzling new opera&quot;, a reviewer pointed out, was that &quot;it blows apart this crippling reverence and presents the drama afresh&quot;

One reviewer underlined the fact that &quot;McGuinness has whittled Sophocles&#x27;s plays down to a succession of very short, simple lines that can be easily heard when sung across an auditorium&quot;, and that &quot;Anderson&#x27;s music fills the emotional space around these lines&quot;, to conclude that &quot;[f]or all the antiquity of its roots, Thebans may point to the future of opera&quot;. Another reviewer declared that Frank McGuinness &quot;has supplied what seems an eminently settable, elegant condensation of the drama&quot;, and that the opera as a whole offers &quot;[t]he superb assurance of the writing metallically intent but underpinned by a novel harmonic richness&quot;.

==Film and television==
McGuinness has written a number of film scripts. His script for &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; (Dir. Pat O&#x27;Connor, 2005) was an adaptation of the play of the same title by Brian Friel. This film&#x27;s &quot;most significant transformation of the play&quot;, one critic has pointed out, is the shifting of a defining dancing scene from the end of the first Act to the end of the story, which &quot;reveals the defining principle of the film: it turns memory into ritual&quot;. McGuinness was also the author of the original script for &quot;Talk of Angels&quot;, the cinema adaptation of Kate O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s banned novel &quot;Mary Lavelle&quot;, although the script was considerably modified in the final production.

Discussing his childhood, McGuinness has explained that, while there were no books around when he was growing up, in addition to newspapers, they had &quot;television, which is the great subverter, a wonderful wonderful (sic) source of entertainment at the time&quot;. His television films include &quot;Scout&quot; (BBC 1987), directed by Danny Boyle, about the talent scout for the football team Manchester United in Northern Ireland, and &quot;A Song for Jenny&quot; (BBC 2015), adapted from Julie Nicholson&#x27;s book of the same title, about the aftermath of the 2005 Islamist terrorist bombings in London. McGuinness was also the scriptwriter for the ground-breaking television film &quot;A Short Stay in Switzerland&quot; (BBC 2009), dealing with euthanasia. In addition, McGuinness has scripted a number of documentaries for television, including &quot;The Messiah XXI&quot; (RTÉ, 2000), commemorating the premiere of Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Messiah&quot; in Dublin in 1791, and &quot;Happy Birthday Oscar Wilde&quot; (RTÉ, 2004), celebrating the Irish writer.

==Themes and opinions==
Major recurring features of McGuinness&#x27;s playwriting include the treatment of historical events and the prominent inclusion of gay or bisexual characters.

A writer&#x27;s task, McGuiness declared in 2015, is &quot;to do something that no one has done before, to discover&quot;. In the same interview, he added that: &quot;The enquiring mind, the radical mind, will always be ill at ease about what is said about a particular subject.&quot;

<doc id="400637" wikidata="Q1378060" url="?curid=400637" title="List of airports in Japan">
<text>This is a list of airports in Japan, grouped by classification and sorted by location. As of February 2012, the country has a total of 98 airports, of which 28 are operated by the central government and 67 by local governments.

==Airport classifications==
In Japan, airports serving civil aviation routes are governed by the Aeronautical Law for safety purposes, by the Noise Prevention Law for noise prevention purposes and by the Airport Act for economic development purposes. The latter law groups such airports into four legal classifications:

* Hub/First Class airports (拠点空港) serve a hub role in domestic or international transportation. They are subdivided into privately managed airports (the three largest international airports), national airports (run by the central government) and special regional airports (hubs run by prefectural or municipal governments).
* Regional/Second Class airports (地方管理空港) are other prefectural/municipal airports that the central government deems important to national aviation.
* Joint-use/Third Class airports (共用空港) are those shared between civil aviation and the Japan Self-Defense Forces.
* Other airports (その他の空港) fall outside the above categories.

Some airports in Japan do not fall under the scope of the Japanese airport statutes. These include the three major U.S. military air bases in Japan (Kadena Air Base, MCAS Iwakuni and Yokota Air Base) and certain smaller aerodromes for firefighting, corporate or other special purposes. In 2001, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which receives 20% of the public-works construction budget, commenced a scheme to build airfields predominantly for airlifting vegetables. Kasaoka Airfield was one of nine airfields constructed; however it was later determined that flying vegetables to Okayama from Kasaoka took just as long due to loading and unloading, and cost approximately six times as much as road transport.

<text>Kurt Weil (2 January 1932 – 12 December 2012) was a Swiss jazz vibraphonist.

Weil was born in Zürich. He learned piano and trombone as a youth, but was playing vibraphone professionally by 1952, as a member of Rio de Gregori&#x27;s ensemble. He moved to Stockholm in 1955, playing with Hacke Björksten, Stan Getz, and Tony Scott. He founded his own group in 1957, which included Raymond Court, George Gruntz, and Daniel Humair as sidemen; this ensemble played for more than a decade in varying forms. In the 1970s, Weil ended the band and moved back to Switzerland, working for GRP Records and running a jazz radio program. He returned to music in the 1990s with a new band, playing with Joe Beck, Mark Egan, and Danny Gottlieb.

Weil died on 12 December 2012, of natural causes.

<doc id="400641" wikidata="Q943853" url="?curid=400641" title="Hudson River School">
<text>The Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century American art movement embodied by a group of landscape painters whose aesthetic vision was influenced by Romanticism. Early on, the paintings typically depicted the Hudson River Valley and the surrounding area, including the Catskill, Adirondack, and White Mountains.

Works by second-generation artists expanded to include other locales in New England, the Maritimes, the Western United States, and South America.

== Overview ==
The school of landscape painters flourished between 1825 and 1870, which was often called the &quot;native,&quot; &quot;American,&quot; or &quot;New York&quot; school. New York City was the center of it, many members had studios in the Tenth Street Studio Building in Greenwich Village. The term Hudson River School is thought to have been coined by the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; art critic Clarence Cook or by landscape painter Homer Dodge Martin. The name appeared in print in 1879, it was initially used during the 1870s disparagingly, as the style had gone out of favor after the &quot;plein-air&quot; Barbizon School had come into vogue among American patrons and collectors.

Hudson River School paintings reflect three themes of America in the 19th century: discovery, exploration, and settlement. They also depict the American landscape as a pastoral setting, where human beings and nature coexist peacefully. Hudson River School landscapes are characterized by their realistic, detailed, and sometimes idealized portrayal of nature, often juxtaposing peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley just as it was coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature in the form of the American landscape was a reflection of God, though they varied in the depth of their religious conviction. They were inspired by European masters such as Claude Lorrain, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner. Several painters were members of the Düsseldorf School of Painting, and they were educated by German Paul Weber.

== Founder ==

Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the School. He took a steamship up the Hudson in the autumn of 1825, stopping first at West Point then at Catskill landing. He hiked west high into the eastern Catskill Mountains of New York to paint the first landscapes of the area. The first review of his work appeared in the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; on November 22, 1825. Cole was from England and the brilliant autumn colours in the American landscape inspired him. His close friend Asher Brown Durand became a prominent figure in the school. A prominent element of the Hudson River School was its themes of nationalism, nature, and property. Adherents of the movement also tended to be suspicious of the economic and technological development of the age.

== Second generation ==

The &quot;second generation&quot; of Hudson River School artists emerged after Cole&#x27;s premature death in 1848; its members included Cole&#x27;s prize pupil Frederic Edwin Church, John Frederick Kensett, and Sanford Robinson Gifford. Works by artists of this second generation are often described as examples of Luminism. Kensett, Gifford, and Church were also among the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Most of the finest works of the second generation were painted between 1855 and 1875. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were celebrities then. They were both influenced by the Düsseldorf school of painting, and Bierstadt had studied in that city for several years. Thousands of people would pay 25 cents per person to view paintings such as &quot;Niagara&quot; and &quot;The Icebergs&quot;. The epic size of these landscapes was unexampled in earlier American painting and reminded Americans of the vast, untamed, and magnificent wilderness areas in their country. This was the period of settlement in the American West, preservation of national parks, and establishment of green city parks.

== Female artists ==
Several women were associated with the Hudson River School. Susie M. Barstow was an avid mountain climber who painted the mountain scenery of the Catskills and the White Mountains. Eliza Pratt Greatorex was an Irish-born painter who was the second woman elected to the National Academy of Design. Julie Hart Beers led sketching expeditions in the Hudson Valley region before moving to a New York City art studio with her daughters. Harriet Cany Peale studied with Rembrandt Peale and Mary Blood Mellen was a student and collaborator with Fitz Henry Lane.

== Legacy ==
Hudson River School art has had minor periods of a resurgence in popularity. The school gained interest after World War I, likely due to nationalist attitudes. Interest declined until the 1960s, and the regrowth of the Hudson Valley has spurred further interest in the movement. Historic house museums and other sites dedicated to the Hudson River School include Olana State Historic Site in Hudson, New York, the Thomas Cole National Historic Site in the town of Catskill, the Newington-Cropsey Foundation&#x27;s historic house museum, art gallery, and research library in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, and the John D. Barrow Art Gallery in the village of Skaneateles, New York.

== Collections ==

=== Public collections ===
One of the largest collections of paintings by artists of the Hudson River School is at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut. Some of the most notable works in the Atheneum&#x27;s collection are 13 landscapes by Thomas Cole and 11 by Hartford native Frederic Edwin Church. They were personal friends of the museum&#x27;s founder, Daniel Wadsworth.

<text>Thomas Cole (February 1, 1801 – February 11, 1848) was an English-born American artist and the founder of the Hudson River School art movement. Cole is widely regarded as the first significant American landscape painter. He was known for his romantic landscape and history paintings. Influenced by European painters, but with a strong American sensibility, he was prolific throughout his career and worked primarily with oil on canvas. His paintings are typically allegoric and often depict small figures or structures set against moody and evocative natural landscapes. They are usually escapist, framing the New World as a natural eden contrasting with the smog-filled cityscapes of Industrial Revolution-era Britain, in which he grew up. His works, often seen as conservative, criticize the contemporary trends of industrialism, urbanism, and westward expansion.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Bolton le Moors, Lancashire, in 1801, Cole immigrated with his family to the United States in 1818, settling in Steubenville, Ohio. At the age of twenty-two, he moved to Philadelphia and later, in 1825, to Catskill, New York, where he lived with his children and wife until his death in 1848.

Cole found work early on as an engraver. He was largely self-taught as a painter, relying on books and by studying the work of other artists. In 1822, he started working as a portrait painter and later on, gradually shifted his focus to landscape.

== Painting ==

In New York, Cole sold three paintings to George W. Bruen, who subsequently financed a summer trip to the Hudson Valley where the artist produced landscapes featuring the Catskill Mountain House, the famous Kaaterskill Falls, the ruins of Fort Putnam, and two views of Cold Spring. Returning to New York, he displayed five landscapes in the window of William Colman&#x27;s bookstore; according to the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; the two views of Cold Spring were purchased by A. Seton, who lent them to the American Academy of the Fine Arts annual exhibition in 1826. This garnered Cole the attention of John Trumbull, Asher B. Durand, and William Dunlap. Among the paintings was a landscape called &quot;View of Fort Ticonderoga from Gelyna&quot;. Trumbull was especially impressed with the work of the young artist and sought him out, bought one of his paintings, and put him into contact with a number of his wealthy friends including Robert Gilmor of Baltimore and Daniel Wadsworth of Hartford, who became important patrons of the artist.

Eighty-nine of Cole&#x27;s paintings were exhibited at the National Academy of Design between its founding in 1825 and Cole&#x27;s death in 1848. Five of his works were engraved and published in &quot;The Token and Atlantic Souvenir&quot; annual gift book between 1826 and 1842. Historian David S. Lovejoy considers the best to be &quot;The Whirlwind&quot; (1837), which Lovejoy said &quot;is unique in its boldness&quot; compared to the predominantly serene landscapes of the period. Published in the 1830 volume, contemporary critic John Neal called &quot;Chocurua&#x27;s Curse&quot; &quot;beautifully contrived&quot;.

Cole was primarily a painter of landscapes, but he also painted allegorical works. The most famous of these are the five-part series, &quot;The Course of Empire&quot;, which depict the same landscape over generations—from a near state of nature to consummation of empire, and then decline and desolation—now in the collection of the New-York Historical Society and the four-part &quot;The Voyage of Life&quot;. There are two versions of the latter, the 1840 original at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York and the 1842 replicas with minor alterations at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. Among Cole&#x27;s other famous works are &quot;The Oxbow&quot; (1836), &quot;The Notch of the White Mountains&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone at his cabin at the Great Osage Lake&quot;, and &quot;Lake with Dead Trees&quot; (1825) which is at the Allen Memorial Art Museum. He also painted &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot; (1828), with lavish detail of Adam and Eve living amid waterfalls, vivid plants, and deer. In 2014, friezes painted by Cole on the walls of his home, which had been decorated over, were discovered.

Cole influenced his peers in the art movement later termed the Hudson River School, especially Asher B. Durand and Frederic Edwin Church. Church studied with Cole from 1844 to 1846, where he learned Cole&#x27;s technique of sketching from nature and later developing an idealized, finished composition; Cole&#x27;s influence is particularly notable in Church&#x27;s early paintings. Cole spent the years 1829 to 1832 and 1841 to 1842 abroad, mainly in England and Italy.

== Other work ==
Cole is best known for his work as an American landscape artist. In an 1836 article on &quot;American Scenery&quot;, he described his complex relationship with the American landscape in esthetic, emotional, and spiritual terms. He also produced thousands of sketches of varying subject matter. Over 2,500 of these sketches can be seen at The Detroit Institute of Arts.

In 1842, Cole embarked on a Grand Tour of Europe in an effort to study in the style of the Old Masters and to paint its scenery. Most striking to Cole was Europe&#x27;s tallest active volcano, Mount Etna. Cole was so moved by the volcano&#x27;s beauty that he produced several sketches and at least six paintings of it. The most famous of these works is &quot;A View of Mount Etna from Taormina&quot; which is a oil on canvas. Cole also produced a highly detailed sketch &quot;View of Mount Etna&quot; which shows a panoramic view of the volcano with the crumbling walls of the ancient Greek theater of Taormina on the far right.

Cole was also a poet and dabbled in architecture, a not uncommon practice at the time when the profession was not so codified. Cole was an entrant in the design competition held in 1838 to create the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. His entry won third place, and many contend that the finished building, a composite of the first, second, and third-place entries, bears a great similarity to Cole&#x27;s entry.

== Personal life ==
After 1827 Cole maintained a studio at the farm called Cedar Grove, in the town of Catskill, New York. He painted a significant portion of his work in this studio. In 1836, he married Maria Bartow of Catskill, a niece of the owners, and became a year-round resident. Thomas and Maria had five children. Cole&#x27;s daughter Emily was a botanical artist who worked in watercolor and painted porcelain. Cole&#x27;s sister, Sarah Cole, was also a landscape painter.

Additionally, Cole held many friendships with important figures in the art world including Daniel Wadsworth, with whom he shared a close friendship. Proof of this friendship can be seen in the letters that were unearthed in the 1980s by the Trinity College Watkinson Library. Cole emotionally wrote Wadsworth in July 1832: &quot;Years have passed away since I saw you &amp; time &amp; the world have undoubtedly wrought many changes in both of us; but the recollection of your friendship... [has] never faded in my mind &amp; I look at those pleasures as &#x27;flowers that never will in other garden grow-&#x27;&quot;
Thomas Cole died at Catskill on February 11, 1848, of pleurisy. The fourth highest peak in the Catskills is named Thomas Cole Mountain in his honor. Cedar Grove, also known as the Thomas Cole House, was declared a National Historic Site in 1999 and is now open to the public.

<doc id="400644" wikidata="Q1451318" url="?curid=400644" title="Jasper Francis Cropsey">
<text>Jasper Francis Cropsey (February 18, 1823 – June 22, 1900) was an American architect and artist. He is best known for his Hudson River School landscape paintings.

==Early years==
Cropsey was born on his father Jacob Rezeau Cropsey&#x27;s farm in Rossville on Staten Island, New York, the oldest of eight children. As a young boy, Cropsey had recurring periods of poor health. While absent from school, Cropsey taught himself to draw. His early drawings included architectural sketches and landscapes drawn on notepads and in the margins of his schoolbooks.

==Career==
Cropsey trained as an architect under the tuition of Joseph Trench in the early 1840s, a period in which he was also trained in watercolor painting, instructed by Edward Maury, and took some life drawing courses at the National Academy of Design. He set up his own architecture office in 1843, but began exhibiting his watercolors at the National Academy of Design in 1844. A year later he was elected an associate member and turned exclusively to landscape painting; shortly after he was featured in an exhibition entitled &quot;Italian Compositions&quot;.

Cropsey traveled in Europe from 1847 to 1849, visiting England, France, Switzerland, and Italy. He was elected a full member of the Academy in 1851. Cropsey was a personal friend of Henry Tappan, the president of the University of Michigan from 1852 to 1863. At Tappan&#x27;s invitation, he traveled to Ann Arbor in 1855 and produced two paintings, one of the Detroit Observatory, and a landscape of the campus. He went abroad again in 1856, and resided seven years in London, sending his pictures to the Royal Academy and to the International exhibition of 1862.

Returning home, he opened a studio in New York and specialized in autumnal landscape paintings of the northeastern United States, often idealized and with vivid colors. Cropsey co-founded, with ten fellow artists, the American Society of Painters in Water Colors in 1866. He also made the architectural designs for the stations of the elevated railways in New York.

===Hudson River School===
Cropsey&#x27;s interest in architecture continued throughout his life and was a strong influence in his painting, most evident in his precise arrangement and outline of forms. But Cropsey was best known for his lavish use of color and, as a first-generation member from the Hudson River School, painted autumn landscapes that startled viewers with their boldness and brilliance. As an artist, he believed landscapes were the highest art form and that nature was a direct manifestation of God. He also felt a patriotic affiliation with nature and saw his paintings as depicting the rugged and unspoiled qualities of America.

Jasper Cropsey died in anonymity but was rediscovered by galleries and collectors in the 1960s. Today, Cropsey&#x27;s paintings are found in many major American museums, including the National Gallery of Art, the North Carolina Museum of Art, the Currier Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Timken Museum of Art in San Diego, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, the Princeton University Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Works by Cropsey also hang in the White House.

===Works===
Some of Cropsey&#x27;s works include &quot;Jedburgh Abbey&quot;; &quot;Pontaine Marshes&quot; (1847); &quot;Backwoods of America&quot; (1857); &quot;Richmond Hill&quot; (1862); &quot;Indian Summer&quot; (1866); &quot;Greenwood Lake&quot; (1875); &quot;Lake Nemi in Italy&quot; (1879); &quot;Old Church at Arreton, Isle of Wight&quot; (1880); &quot;Ramapo Valley&quot; (1881); &quot;Autumn on the Hudson&quot; (1860): &quot;Wawayanda Valley&quot; (1883); &quot;Spring-time in England&quot; (1884); &quot;October in Ramapo Valley&quot; (1885); &quot;Autumn on Lake George&quot;, and &quot;A Showery Day&quot; (1886).

His architectural works included New York City brownstones, the since-demolished 14th Street station for the IRT Sixth Avenue Line in Manhattan, and St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church on Staten Island.

Some of Cropsey&#x27;s painting command high prices at auctions. &quot;Greenwood Lake&quot; (1879) sold at Christie&#x27;s auction in 2012 for $422,500. Sunset, Camel&#x27;s Hump, Lake Champlain (1877) sold for $314,500 in 2011.

===Collection===
Cropsey&#x27;s home and studio, Ever Rest, in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, has the largest permanent collection of Cropsey&#x27;s work, collected by his great-granddaughter Barbara Newington. The collection has been on display since 1977 and the founding of the Newington-Cropsey Foundation.

==Personal life==
Cropsey married Maria Cooley in May 1847. He had met her during one of his visits to Greenwood Lake after 1843. Maria&#x27;s father, Isaac P. Cooley, was a justice of the peace from 1837 to 1839 and became a judge over the New Jersey Court of Common Pleas in 1840. Cooley then became a member of New Jersey State House of Assembly from 1860 to 1861. Cooley offered to build Cropsey a studio on his estate but the offer was declined. In 1869 Cropsey built a 29-room Gothic Revival mansion and studio in Warwick, New York that he named Aladdin. As well as living in New York City, he spent part of his time in Warwick until the mansion was sold in 1884.

In 1884 Cropsey first rented then in 1885 bought a house at Hastings-on-Hudson, New York he named &quot;Ever Rest&quot;. He and Maria had two children: Mary Cortelyou Cropsey Howells (b. September. 5, 1850, d. July 30, 1921) and Lilly Frances Cropsey (b. July 16, 1859, d. February 21, 1889). Cropsey lived at Ever Rest until his death on June 22, 1900, and his wife Maria lived there until she died in 1906, having been married to &quot;Frank&quot; for 54 years.

<text>Thomas Moran (February 12, 1837 – August 25, 1926) was an American painter and printmaker of the Hudson River School in New York whose work often featured the Rocky Mountains. Moran and his family, wife Mary Nimmo Moran and daughter Ruth, took residence in New York where he obtained work as an artist. He was a younger brother of the noted marine artist Edward Moran, with whom he shared a studio. A talented illustrator and exquisite colorist, Thomas Moran was hired as an illustrator at &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. During the late 1860s, he was appointed the chief illustrator for the magazine, a position that helped him launch his career as one of the premier painters of the American landscape, in particular, the American West.

Moran along with Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Hill, and William Keith are sometimes referred to as belonging to the Rocky Mountain School of landscape painters because of all of the Western landscapes made by this group.

==Biography==

Moran was born in Bolton, Lancashire, in England, to Mary (née Higson) and Thomas Moran Sr., one of seven children. His father belonged to a family of handloom weavers. He wanted a better future to his family, so they moved to the United States in 1844, when young Thomas was 7 years old. The trip had a life-long impression on Moran, who later created sketches and paintings of the sea. His family first settled in Baltimore, moving afterwards to Kensington, a suburb of Philadelphia. 

Moran began his artistic career as a teenage apprentice to the Philadelphia wood-engraving firm Scattergood &amp; Telfer. Moran found the engraving process &quot;tedious&quot; and spent his free time working on his own watercolors. By the mid-1850s, he was drawing the firm&#x27;s illustrations for publication rather than carving them. It was then that he encountered illustrated books that included examples of the work of British artist J. M. W. Turner, who was to be a lasting influence on Moran&#x27;s work. He also began studying with local painter James Hamilton. Moran traveled to England in 1862 to see Turner&#x27;s work. From that point on, he emulated Turner&#x27;s use of color, his choice of landscapes, and was inspired by his explorations in watercolor, a medium for which Turner was particularly well-known. 

During the 1870s and 1880s, Moran&#x27;s designs for wood-engraved illustrations appeared in major magazines and gift oriented publications. Although he mastered multiple printing media including wood-engraving, etching, and lithography, which he learned from his brothers, he received renown for his paintings in oil and in watercolor. The height of his career coincided with the popularity of chromolithography, which Moran used to make color prints of his works, so that they could be widely distributed. He was also one of the leaders of the etching revival in the United States and Great Britain. 
Moran was married to Scottish born Mary Nimmo Moran (1842–1899), an etcher and landscape painter. The couple had two daughters and a son. His brothers Edward (1829–1901), John (1831–1902) and Peter (1841–1914), as well as his nephews Edward Percy Moran (1862–1935) and Jean Leon Gerome Ferris (1863–1930) were also active as artists. His brother John was also a pioneer in artistic photography. The two often worked side by side, John photographing the same scene that Thomas was painting. He died in Santa Barbara, California on August 25, 1926.

Thomas Moran&#x27;s vision of the Western landscape was critical to the creation of Yellowstone National Park. In 1871, Ferdinand Vandeever Hayden, director of the United States Geological Survey, invited Moran, at the request of American financier Jay Cooke, to join Hayden and his expedition team into the unknown Yellowstone region. Hayden was just about to embark on his arduous journey when he received a letter from Cooke presenting Moran as &quot;an artist of Philadelphia of rare genius&quot;. Funded by Cooke (the director of the Northern Pacific Railroad), and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, a new illustrated magazine, Moran agreed to join the survey team of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 in their exploration of the Yellowstone region. During forty days in the wilderness area, Moran visually documented over 30 different sites and produced a diary of the expedition&#x27;s progress and daily activities. His sketches, along with photographs produced by survey member William Henry Jackson, captured the nation&#x27;s attention and helped inspire Congress to establish the Yellowstone region as the first national park in 1872. Moran&#x27;s paintings along with Jackson&#x27;s photographs revealed the scale and splendor of the beautiful Yellowstone region where written or oral descriptions failed, persuading President Grant and the US Congress that Yellowstone was to be preserved. Moran&#x27;s impact on Yellowstone was great, but Yellowstone had a significant influence on the artist, too. His first national recognition as an artist, as well as his first large financial success, resulted from his connection with Yellowstone. He even adopted a new signature: T-Y-M, Thomas &quot;Yellowstone&quot; Moran. Just one year after his introduction to the area, Moran captured the imagination of the American public with his first enormous painting of a far-western natural wonder, &quot;The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone&quot;, which the government purchased in 1872 for $10,000. For the next two decades, he published his work in various periodicals and created hundreds of large paintings. Among these, &quot;The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone&quot; (1872) and &quot;Chasm of the Colorado&quot; (1873–74) are exhibited at the Department of the Interior Museum.

Over the next forty years Moran traveled extensively. He went back to Yellowstone with Jackson in 1892. They were invited by Elwood Mead, the state engineer of Wyoming, in preparation for a &quot;Wyoming Exhibition&quot; at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Thousands of tourists were now able to visit the park, arriving by the Northern Pacific Railway, and Moran and Jackson were able to take advantage of the tourist facilities, such as a hotel at Mammoth Hot Springs. Moran wrote &quot;After a day at Norris we left for the Grand Canyon where we stayed two days and made a great many photos. I saw so much to sketch that I have determined to return there myself after I have been to the Geyser Basins and the lake and spend a week at work there. It is as glorious in color as ever and I was completely carried away by its magnificence. I think I can paint a better picture of it than the old one after I have made my sketches.&quot; Moran sketched many more images of the Canyon on this trip than he had in 1871, including views from the viewpoint named for him on the 1871 trip, &quot;Moran Point&quot;. &quot;The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone&quot; (1893–1901) is on view at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

Moran was elected to the membership of the National Academy of Design in 1884 and produced numerous works of art in his senior years.

==Painting in the White House==

Thomas Moran has a painting exhibited as part of the White House collection. In the photograph depicting President Barack Obama and Israeli President Shimon Peres in the Oval Office it is seen on the wall: the portrait of George Washington is between &quot;City of Washington from Beyond the Navy Yard&quot; (1833) by George Cooke (on the left) and &quot;The Three Tetons&quot; (1895) by Thomas Moran (on the right). Official White House photo by Pete Souza.
