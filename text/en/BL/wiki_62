<text>Sexton Blake is a fictional British detective, whose adventures captivated readers for over eight decades from 1893 to 1978. Blake featured in more than 4,000 stories by approximately 200 different authors, making him one of the most prolifically chronicled characters in English literature. The detective&#x27;s adventures spanned multiple formats including comic strips, novels, radio serials, silent films, and a 1960s ITV television series, reaching audiences across Britain and internationally in various languages.

Initially conceived as a Victorian gentleman detective, Blake evolved significantly over time, acquiring now-iconic elements like his Baker Street residence, his young assistant Tinker, his bloodhound Pedro, and his housekeeper Mrs. Bardell. While often compared to Sherlock Holmes, Blake&#x27;s adventures typically featured more action-oriented plots and colorful adversaries, including memorable villains like Zenith the Albino, George Marsden Plummer, Dr. Huxton Rymer, Leon Kestrel, Waldo the Wonderman and the Criminals&#x27; Confederation. The character reached his peak popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, particularly through publications like The Union Jack and The Sexton Blake Library, which at its height published five times monthly.

==Publication history==
The first Sexton Blake story was &quot;The Missing Millionaire&quot;. Written by Harry Blyth (using the pseudonym Hal Meredeth), it was published in The Halfpenny Marvel number 6, on 20 December 1893, a story paper owned by the Amalgamated Press. Blyth wrote six more Sexton Blake tales, three for the Marvel and three for The Union Jack a story paper launched in April 1894.

The Amalgamated Press purchased the copyright to Blake along with the first story Blyth had submitted and from 1895 onwards several authors began to pen Blake tales. From August 1905 Blake became the resident character in Union Jack, appearing in every issue until its transformation into the Detective Weekly in 1933. Blake continued as the main feature until Detective Weekly ended in 1940.

Blake&#x27;s popularity began to grow during the Edwardian era, and he appeared in a number of different story papers. These appearances included serials in the tabloid sized &quot;Boys&#x27; Friend&quot; (1905), complete tales in the pocket-sized &quot;Penny Pictorial&quot; (from 1907 to 1913 (when that magazine ended), and short stories in &quot;Answers&quot;, (1908–1911) one of the Amalgamated Press&#x27; most popular papers. Writers from this era include: William Murray Graydon, Maxwell Scott, Norman Goddard, Cecil Hayter, D. H. Parry, E. W. Alais, W. J Lomax, and Michael Storm.

In the second decade of the 20th century, new writers joined the ranks and created the formidable master criminals that matched wits with Blake. These include Andrew Murray, Anthony Skene, Robert Murray Graydon, Edwy Searles Brooks and George Hamilton Teed.

===Blake gets his own title===

Longer tales of 60,000 words or so appeared in &quot;The Boys&#x27; Friend Library&quot; and the success of these led to the creation of &quot;The Sexton Blake Library&quot; in 1915. This digest-sized publication specialized in longer tales, and at the height of its popularity was published 5 times a month. It ran for just under 50 years.

The majority of &quot;Sexton Blake Library&quot; covers (prior to editor William Howard Baker&#x27;s 1956 revamp of the character) were painted by master Sexton Blake illustrator Eric Parker

Writers who worked on Sexton Blake stories throughout this 53-year span included Charles Henry St. John Cooper, John Creasey, Jack Trevor Story, John G. Brandon Michael Moorcock, and (allegedly) Brian O&#x27;Nolan (aka Flann O&#x27;Brien and Myles Coppaleen.)

In 1959 Fleetway Publications acquired the rights to Sexton Blake adventures and published The Sexton Blake Library until the title&#x27;s demise. The final tale, The Last Tiger, was published in June 1963.

In 1965, Blake editor William Howard Baker licensed the rights of the Sexton Blake character. He published the fifth series of The Sexton Blake Library independently via Mayflower-Dell Books, which ran until 1968. He then issued a final series of four Sexton Blake novels, using his Howard Baker Books imprint, in 1969. From 1968 to 1971 Valiant published new comic strips in the style of the Knockout strips from decades earlier. Blake&#x27;s last original appearance was in &quot;Sexton Blake and the Demon God&quot; “a period thriller with ancient curses and cliff-hanger endings” in 1978.

===Comic strips: 1939–1979===

Blake comic strips featured in &quot;The Knock-Out Comic&quot; (later &quot;Knock-Out Comic &amp; Magnet&quot; and, finally, simply &quot;Knockout&quot;) from 1939 to 1960. The Blake strip was illustrated originally by artist Jos Walker and then by Alfred Taylor, who illustrated Blake&#x27;s adventures for ten years. The undoubted highlight of Blake&#x27;s 21-year run in &quot;Knockout&quot; was a 14-part 1949 strip drawn by Blake&#x27;s greatest illustrator Eric Parker, entitled &quot;The Secret of Monte Cristo&quot;. This was Parker&#x27;s only contribution to Blake&#x27;s comic strip adventures.

There was one &quot;Super Detective Library&quot; story about Blake: issue 68 (published November 1955), featuring a comic strip entitled &quot;Sexton Blake&#x27;s Diamond Hunt&quot;.

A final Sexton Blake comic strip (initiated to tie in with the 1967–1971 television show) featured in IPC&#x27;s weekly boys&#x27; anthology &quot;Valiant&quot;, from January 1968 to May 1970.

A seven-part Blake comic strip featured in IPC&#x27;s comic &quot;Tornado&quot; from March 1979 to May 1979. A contract dispute (subsequently resolved in IPC&#x27;s favour) caused the &quot;Tornado&quot; editorial team to rename Blake &quot;Victor Drago&quot; (and Tinker &amp; Pedro &quot;Spencer &amp; Brutus&quot;) for the duration of this strip.

===Other publications ===

A series of 160-page Sexton Blake annuals, featuring old stories and new material, began in 1938 and lasted till 1941.

Four hardbacks designed for the younger market were published by Dean &amp; Son Ltd during 1968. The third of these, &quot;Raffles&#x27; Crime in Gibraltar&quot;, portrayed Blake contending with A. J. Raffles, E.W. Hornung&#x27;s amateur cracksman.

There were a few anthologies and reprints in the 80s and 90s.

In 2009, IPC&#x27;s information manager, David Abbott, signed licenses to publish two Blake omnibus archive editions: &quot;The Casebook of Sexton Blake&quot;, published by Wordsworth Editions, and &quot;Sexton Blake, Detective&quot; published by Snowbooks.

In 2009 Wordsworth Books published the casebook of Sexton Blake and Snowbooks published Sexton Blake Detective.

In 2013, Obverse Books licensed the character and published &quot;The Silent Thunder Caper&quot; by Mark Hodder, the first book in a proposed sixth series of the Sexton Blake Library, The imprint had previously published a collection of short stories featuring Blake villain Zenith the Albino.

2018 saw an uptick in Sexton Blake reprints, with the first print novels published by Stillwoods Publishing, a Canadian publisher out of Nova Scotia.

In 2020 ROH Press began publishing Sexton Blake tales with &quot;Sexton Blake The Early Years&quot;, a collection of Blake&#x27;s first cases.

That same year British publishers Rebellion Developments released a Sexton Blake special under its Treasury of British Comics imprint. They also produced four anthologies in 2020-21, each introduced by Blakeologist Mark Hodder.

===Sexton Blake bibliography===

The Sexton Blake bibliography is so extensive it has been divided into four sections. For a list of titles from the different Blake eras check out the links below.

1893–1911: The Victorian/Edwardian Era Sexton Blake bibliography
In this era Blake works solo and with a variety of partners and detectives. In 1904 he acquires a sidekick, a young boy named Tinker. The following year he moved to Baker Street and acquired a dog named Pedro and a landlady named Mrs Bardell.

1912–1945: The Master Criminals Era Sexton Blake bibliography part 2: 1912–1945
From 1913 onwards the master criminals reigned supreme, regularly matching with Blake.

1946–1978: The Post War Era Sexton Blake bibliography part 3: 1946–1978
The era of the New Order saw Blake become more of a James Bond type. It also saw the end of the Sexton Blake Library in 1963. There were a few attempts at bringing him back, but the last original Sexton Blake story was published in 1978.

1979–present: Revivals and Republications Sexton Blake bibliography part 4: 1979–present
Various publishers issued Blake novels and anthologies, collections of some of his most popular adventures.

==Blake&#x27;s evolution==
As the years passed, Blake&#x27;s character experienced various permutations. The first descriptions and illustrations of him showed him to be &quot;a middle-aged Victorian gentleman dressed in the typical clothing of the era and carrying a heavy walking stick&quot;.

At the start of his career in 1893 he was partnered with Jules Gervaise a French detective who was also his mentor. By early in 1894 Blake was solving cases solo. During the remainder of the Victorian era he worked with various assistants Griff (half-man and beast) and a Chinese boy named We-Wee. He lived in a variety of places including Norfolk Street, Strand, New Inn Chambers, and Wych Street.

In &quot;The Lamp of Death&quot; (1894) Sexton Blake met Muriel Lane a woman who would eventually become his wife. His wife was referred to again in the Union Jack Christmas Number for 1901 then disappeared from the Blake canon forever. Blake remained a strict bachelor for the rest of his career.

In 1904 Blake moved to Baker Street, acquired an assistant named Tinker, a landlady named Martha Bardell and a dog named Pedro. Blake began more and more to resemble Sherlock Holmes. Blake was tall, lean, strong limbed, with hair receding at the temples, and with a high intellectual forehead. When indoors at Baker Street he wore a red dressing gown, smoked a briar pipe and had a favourite chair.

Throughout the Edwardian era he worked undercover at variety of jobs: reporter, cab driver, laundryman, sailor, cowboy all of which were reflected in the titles of his adventures. In Sexton Blake KC it was disclosed that he was a fully trained lawyer, in &quot;The Tattooed Eye&quot; (21 November 1908) he says he is a duly qualified medical man but has never practised medicine.

Throughout his career Blake also visited many countries in North America, Africa, South America, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania. Blake spoke a variety of languages and often disguised himself as a local.

In 1908 Blake matched wits with George Marsden Plummer, the first of what would become a long line of master criminals. He was followed by Count Ivor Carlac in 1912, then Professor Kew, Prince Wu Ling, Zenith the Albino and many others.

The 1920s and early 1930s are considered Blake&#x27;s Golden Age, a time when he matched wits with some of his greatest foes. By the mid 1940s most had disappeared.

Many of Blake&#x27;s writers had been men of adventure who had travelled the world. When World War II started, they enlisted, leaving just a small group of writers behind (with the addition of the occasional guest writer). Consequently, the standard of Blake&#x27;s stories suffered.

In November 1955, William Howard Baker became editor of the &quot;Sexton Blake Library&quot; and, during 1956, introduced a successful update of the Blake formula. The &quot;Sexton Blake Library&quot; found new popularity with faster-moving, more contemporary stories (often influenced by American pulp fiction).

Blake, who had been relocated a number of times over the years, was relocated to a suite of plush offices in Berkeley Square (while retaining lodgings at Baker Street) and acquired a secretary, Paula Dane, who became a not-quite-love interest for Blake.

Tinker was no longer a boy assistant, but a mature young man who went by his full name Edward Carter. Blake&#x27;s office receptionist, Marion Lang, was introduced as his female counterpart.

Covers, which had become rather staid during the early 1950s, became much more dynamic and a new group of authors was commissioned.

Baker remained as editor until 1963 (his last story was &quot;The Last Tiger&quot;) before becoming Blake&#x27;s licensor/publisher and continuing to oversee Blake&#x27;s print adventures until January 1970.

There were a few reprints in anthologies in the 1970s and 1980s. The new millennium has seen an uptick in reprints.

==Blake&#x27;s associates==
Blake&#x27;s first associate from &quot;The Halfpenny Marvel&quot; No. 6 (&quot;The Missing Millionaire&quot;) is the Frenchman Jules Gervaise, who gives him the first recorded case. By issue No. 7 (&quot;A Christmas Crime&quot;), they initiate an investigative company together. In the third story of issue No. 11 (&quot;A Golden Ghost&quot;), Gervaise is not mentioned.

===Blake&#x27;s team===

In &quot;Union Jack&quot; number 53, in a story titled &quot;Cunning Against Skill&quot; (1904), (written by
W. J. Lomax under the pen-name of Herbert Maxwell), Blake picked up a wiry street-wise orphan as an assistant who was known only as Tinker until the 1950s. With the popularity of school stories during the early 1900s, Tinker&#x27;s schooldays were chronicled in issues 229 and 232. Over the years, Tinker changed from a boy and good fighter to a rugged and capable young man. As well as assisting the &quot;guv&#x27;nor&quot;, as he called Blake, Tinker kept Blake&#x27;s crime files up to date with clippings from the daily newspapers, in addition to assisting Blake in his fully equipped crime laboratory. The Edwardian British private detective Herbert Marshall was a friend of one of the Blake authors&#x27;, Charles Henry St John Cooper (1869–1926), and stated that Cooper had based the character of Tinker on Marshall&#x27;s own teenaged assistant Henry Drummond. Drummond sold newspapers in Northumberland Avenue in order to support his widowed mother until, aged just 14, he was offered a job by Marshall. Drummond died in around 1905 from tuberculosis, aged 19.

In 1905, Blake&#x27;s bustling housekeeper Mrs Bardell (created by William Murray Graydon, who also created Pedro the bloodhound), was introduced and remained until the end. Her misuse of the English language was legendary in stories – she was a gifted cook and would always be on hand if a client needed food or a cup of tea. Mrs Bardell even featured as the main character in stories such as: &quot;The Mystery Of Mrs Bardell&#x27;s Xmas Pudding&quot; in 1925 and &quot;Mrs Bardell&#x27;s Xmas Eve&quot; in 1926.

In &quot;Union Jack&quot; number 100 (9 September 1905), a story entitled &quot;The Dog Detective&quot; introduced Blake&#x27;s faithful, wise and ferocious bloodhound, Pedro. Pedro was originally owned by Rafael Calderon, ex-president of a South American state, but after performing various services for Calderon, Blake was given Pedro by Calderon, using the guise of &quot;Mr. Nemo&quot;. Pedro tracked many villains to their lairs in subsequent stories.

Another notable non-human associate (and almost a character in itself) was Blake&#x27;s bullet-proof Rolls-Royce, named The Grey Panther (introduced at a time when most other sleuths were still taking cabs). For a short while, Blake also flew a Moth monoplane (also called &quot;The Grey Panther&quot; and designed by Blake himself).

==Blake&#x27;s enemies==

Sexton Blake had a large rogues gallery of supervillains from around the globe. Some of the most famous included:

*George Marsden Plummer (created by Ernest Semphill in 1908), a dishonest Detective Sergeant at Scotland Yard, opposed Blake, but like many others, Plummer ended in a police cell. Unlike many before him, he repeatedly escaped and became Blake&#x27;s arch-enemy.
*Count Ivor Carlac (created by Andrew Murray in 1912) was a Polish nobleman and former pilot who turned to a life of crime. He was highly cunning, a master of disguise, and utterly ruthless.
*Professor Francis Kew (created by Andrew Murray in 1913) A highly respected surgeon who moonlighted as an arch criminal. He teamed up with Carlac in 1916, and the two would often match wits against Blake over the next twenty years.
*Dr Huxton Rymer (created by George Hamilton Teed in 1913) a world renowned surgeon turned master criminal.
*Prince Wu Ling (created by George Hamilton Teed in 1913) a former Chinese royal bent on world domination.
*Waldo the Wonderman (created by Edwy Searles Brooks in 1918), a circus strongman who had tremendous strength, could contort his body like a rubber man, and was insensitive to pain. He first appeared as a villain and ended in later stories as a friend of Blake&#x27;s, helping him with a number of cases. But despite his reformation, he continued to steal money (but his victims were now blackmailers, swindlers, and other no-good members of the underworld).
*Zenith the Albino (created by Anthony Skene in 1919) the Byronic master thief.
*The Criminals&#x27; Confederation (created by Robert Murray Graydon in 1919) was an insidious criminal organisation that spanned the globe. The Confederation featured in 50 tales from 1919 to 1926.

The type of villain Blake opposed changed with the times (as did Blake himself). After World War II, his opponents became more ordinary, their personalities and motives less fantastic. Veteran writers John Hunter and Walter Tyrer excelled at this type of writing, but others failed to maintain their standards.

==Blake&#x27;s allies==
Sexton Blake also teamed up with a variety of police officers, private detectives and other assorted crime fighters from time to time. Some of the most popular include:

*Detective-Inspector Will Spearing (created by Norman Goddard) Blake&#x27;s first ally from Scotland Yard. Spearing made his debut in Sexton Blake PC in 1905.
*Sir Richard Losely and Lobangu (created by Cecil Hayter in 1907) Sir Richard was a British explorer and Blake&#x27;s former school mate. Lobangu is the mighty chief of the Etbaia tribe of Zulus.
*Honourable John Lawless (created by Andrew Murray) Lawless is an adventurer and proud Britisher who made his debut in The Boundary Raiders (1916). Though not officially employed by the Empire he often fights for King and Country
*Detective-Inspector Coutts (created by Robert Murray Graydon) Coutts made his debut in The Hidden Hand (1916) and fought alongside Blake against the Criminals&#x27; Confederation.
*The Bat (created by Robert Murray Graydon) Dirk Dolland, alias the Bat, made his debut in &quot;The Hidden Hand&quot; (1916). At first a highly talented cracksman the Bat eventually became a strong ally of Blake&#x27;s against the Criminals&#x27; Confederation.
*Nelson Lee (created by Maxwell Scott) Like Blake, Lee was a private investigator created in the 1890s. The two first appeared together in Christmas Clues in 1895. They would team up again in The Winged Terror (1909) and in several tales in 1918.
*Mademoiselle Yvonne Cartier (created by George Hamilton Teed) was at first a Blake foe then a loyal ally and eventually became a detective. She made her debut in Beyond Reach of the Law (1913) and appeared in Blake tales until 1926.
*James &quot;Granite&quot; Grant and Mademoiselle Julie (created by W. W. Sayer) Grant of the British Secret Service and Mademoiselle Julie of the French Secret Service made their debuts in 1920 and fought alongside in numerous adventures for the next six years. The tales were reprinted in the 1930s.

Other associates included Derek &quot;Splash&quot; Page of the &quot;Daily Radio&quot;; Ruff Hanson, a tough American investigator (both created by Gwyn Evans), and Blake&#x27;s friends at Scotland Yard: Chief Detective Inspector Lennard, and Superintendent Venner.

==Adaptations==

===Stage===
There were several Sexton Blake stage plays:
* &quot;The Case of the Coiners&quot; (1907), was the earliest produced
* Percy Holmshaw produced &quot;Sexton Blake: A Detective Story in Four Acts&quot; in 1931. Blake was played by Arthur Wontner, whose performance then led to him being cast as Sherlock Holmes in five films.

===Movies===

====Silent movies====

There were also spoof films titled &quot;Sexton Pimple&quot; (1914), starring the comedian Fred Evans, and Sherlock Blake-The Terrible &#x27;Tec (1916) starring Billy Merson. 

====Talkies====
* &quot;Sexton Blake and the Bearded Doctor&quot; was the first of three Blake talkies produced during the 1930s. Based on a novel by Rex Hardinge, this movie featured George Curzon as Sexton Blake and Tony Sympson as Tinker.
*&quot;Sexton Blake and the Mademoiselle&quot; (featuring Mlle. Roxanne as the female villain from the books), from a story by G H Teed, followed soon afterwards.
* The third production was &quot;Sexton Blake and the Hooded Terror&quot; with Tod Slaughter playing the villain.
* Two movies &quot;Meet Sexton Blake&quot; and &quot;The Echo Murders&quot; were made in 1945. They were directed by John Harlow, and featured David Farrar as Blake. (Farrar had played a small role in &quot;Sexton Blake and the Hooded Terror&quot;.)
* The Hammer film &quot;Murder at Site 3&quot; (1958) featuring Geoffrey Toone did not launch a series.

===Radio===
* On 26 January 1939, BBC Radio broadcast a serial named &quot;Enter Sexton Blake&quot;, featuring George Curzon as Blake and Brian Lawrence as Tinker.
* 30 March 1940, BBC broadcast &quot;A Case for Sexton Blake&quot;, adapted by Francis Durbridge.
* During 1967, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a popular series of Sexton Blake radio adventures starring William Franklyn as Blake, David Gregory as Tinker, and Heather Chasen as Blake&#x27;s secretary, Paula Dane. Broadcast on Thursday nights at 7.00pm, this series of 17 programmes (which ran weekly from 24 August to 14 December) was scripted by Donald Stuart, devised for radio by Philip Ridgeway, and produced by veteran BBC radio producer Alastair Scott Johnston.
* On 6 March 2006, after discussions between noted British radio producer Dirk Maggs and IPC publishing director Andrew Sumner, Maggs recorded a half-hour &quot;Adventures of Sexton Blake&quot; pilot show for his newly formed Perfectly Normal Productions. This humorous satire of Blake&#x27;s adventures featured Simon Jones as Blake, Wayne Forester as Tinker, and a returning William Franklyn, in one of his final performances, as the elderly Blake (who narrates the adventure). As a result of the success of this pilot, Maggs directed a new series of Blake adventures for BBC Radio 2. &quot;The Adventures of Sexton Blake&quot; again featured Jones and Forester, joined by June Whitfield as Mrs Bardell, and Graham Hoadly as Professor Kew. The series was written by Jonathan Nash and Mil Millington and broadcast, in six weekly 15 minute instalments, during late summer 2009. An extended version of the complete series was released on CD by BBC Audiobooks on 10 September 2009. David Quantick&#x27;s accompanying Blake documentary, &quot;The Hunt For Sexton Blake&quot; (also produced by Perfectly Normal Productions) was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 before the series started.

===Television===
====Sexton Blake (1967–71)====

ITV broadcast Rediffusion/Thames Television&#x27;s &quot;Sexton Blake&quot; featuring Laurence Payne as Blake and Roger Foss as Tinker from Monday 25 September 1967 to Wednesday 13 January 1971. In keeping with Sexton Blake&#x27;s classic print adventures, Payne&#x27;s Blake drove a white Rolls-Royce named &quot;The Grey Panther&quot; and owned a bloodhound named Pedro. The show was produced originally by Ronald Marriott for Associated Rediffusion, with Thames Television assuming production in 1968.

Pedro was played by one or more bloodhounds (bitches), which doubled as &#x27;Henry&#x27;, for Chunky dog food advertisements with Clement Freud, and were owned by the then secretary of the Bloodhound Club, Mrs Bobbie Edwards.

During rehearsals for the show in 1968, Laurence Payne was blinded in his left eye by a rapier.

Typical of the TV series&#x27;s sometimes-fantastic storylines (all of which lasted 2–6 episodes) was 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Invicta Ray&quot; in which a villain dressed in a costume and hood of sackcloth-like material and, under the rays of The Invicta Ray, became invisible so that he could commit crimes without being seen.

* A seven-minute 78 rpm record, titled &quot;Murder on the Portsmouth Road&quot;, had a script written by Donald Stuart and featured Arthur Wontner (who also featured as Sherlock Holmes in early British talkies) as Blake.
* Michael Moorcock used Blake as the basis for &quot;The Metatemporal Detective&quot;, Seaton Begg. Moorcock also borrowed the character of Zenith the Albino, both as partial inspiration for Elric of Melniboné and as an actual character (who was implied to be an avatar of Elric&#x27;s). Both Begg and Zenith featured in Obverse Books&#x27; collection &quot;Zenith Lives! &quot; (2012), which includes a new Begg/Zenith novella from Moorcock. Seaton Begg was also the lead character in the 2019 novella &quot;The Immortal Seaton Begg&quot;, which was released as part of Sextet (An Obverse Celebration), a series of six interconnected novellas released in the second half of 2019 to celebrate Obverse Books&#x27; tenth anniversary.
* Dorothy L. Sayers features Sexton Blake stories in her novel &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; as the preferred literature of a young office boy helping Lord Peter Wimsey solving the case.
* Bengali novelist Dinendra Kumar Roy wrote 217 stories in Bengali, following the Sexton Blake series in the name of Robert Blake.

The club&#x27;s wheelchair basketball team won the Champions Cup in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2014. They also won the Kitakyushu Champions Cup and became world champions in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012. Galatasaray women&#x27;s basketball team won the 2013–14 EuroLeague Women and FIBA Eurocup in 2009 and 2018. Galatasaray men&#x27;s basketball team claimed their first EuroCup championship after defeating Strasbourg in 2016.

==Etymology==
Galatasaray () is a quarter in Karaköy in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul, located at the northern shore of the Golden Horn. Its name comes from that of Galata, which may in turn have derived from &quot;Galatai&quot; (meaning the &quot;Galatians&quot;), as the Celtic tribes were thought to have camped at Galata during the Hellenistic period before settling in Galatia in central Anatolia. &quot;Galatasaray&quot; translates directly as &quot;Galata Palace&quot; (&quot;saray&quot; means &quot;palace&quot; in Persian). Galatasaray High School, established in the area in 1481, was the progenitor of Galatasaray S.K. as well as other institutions of Galatasaray Community.

&quot;Galatasaray&quot; is a compound word and is pronounced as such, with a very brief pause between the two words. There is no diminutive form of the club&#x27;s name. Fans refer to the club either by its full name or by its nickname &quot;Cim-Bom(-Bom)&quot;—pronounced )—of uncertain etymology. However, the shortened form &quot;Gala&quot; is sometimes used by English speakers.

==History==
Galatasaray SK was founded in October 1905 (the exact day is disputed, but is traditionally accepted as &quot;17 Teşrinievvel 1321&quot; according to the Islamic Rumi calendar, which corresponds to 30 October 1905 (according to the Gregorian calendar) by Ali Sami Yen and other students of Galatasaray High School (a high school in Istanbul which was established in 1481) as a football club. Ali Sami Yen, who became Galatasaray SK&#x27;s first president and was given the club&#x27;s membership number &quot;1&quot;, was the son of Şemseddin Sami (Frashëri), an Ottoman writer, philosopher, and playwright of ethnic Albanian origin, and a prominent figure of the &quot;Rilindja Kombëtare&quot;, the National Renaissance movement of Albania.

The club&#x27;s first match was against Cadi Keuy FRC and Galatasaray won this game with a score of 2–0. There were discussions about the club&#x27;s name, in which some suggested &quot;Gloria&quot; (victory) and others &quot;Audace&quot; (courage), but it was decided that its name would be Galatasaray.

According to researcher Cem Atabeyoğlu, Galatasaray took its name from one of its first matches. In that match, Galatasaray won 2–0 over Rûm club and the spectators called them &quot;Galata Sarayı Efendileri&quot; (in English: Gentlemen of Galata (City) Palace), and after this event, they adopted that name and started to call their club &quot;GalataSaray&quot;. In 1905, during the era of the Ottoman Empire, there were no laws for associations so the club could not be registered officially, but after the 1912 Law of Association, the club registered legally.

Along with the founder Ali Sami Yen, the co-founders were the ones who were keen to do this sport, such as Asim Tevfik Sonumut, Reşat Şirvani, Cevdet Kalpakçıoğlu, Abidin Daver and Kamil.

At founding in 1905, the colors of the Galatasaray Sports Club were red and white. These are the colors of the modern Turkish flag, but are also the colors of the flag of the Young Turk Revolution. Therefore, despite recent governmental reform, this inspiration made the repressive administration of the day uncomfortable, and said administration hounded the footballers until the colors were (temporarily) changed to yellow and dark blue. After more reforms in 1908, new colors were again chosen: red and yellow. Ali Sami Yen stated, &quot;We were imagining brightness of yellow – red fire over our team and thinking that it would carry us from one victory to another.&quot;

While the football in Turkey began to fully develop, Galatasaray won ten more &quot;Istanbul League&quot; titles until 1952. Upon recognition of professional football in 1952, the first professional but non-national league of Turkey, &quot;Istanbul Professional League&quot; played between 1952 and 1959. Galatasaray won three of these seven titles.

Turkcell Super League, the top-flight professional league in Turkish nationwide football, and the most popular sporting competition in the country, formed in 1959. Galatasaray joined all seasons and won 24 league titles since then.

The Turkish Football Federation started to organize &quot;Turkish Cup&quot; (today it is organized with the name Ziraat Turkish Cup) in the 1962–63 season for Turkish clubs to qualify for the UEFA competitions. This is the only national cup competition in Turkey. Galatasaray joined all seasons and won 18 trophies since then.

==Crest==

Galatasaray&#x27;s first emblem was a figure of a spread-winged eagle with a football in its beak, drawn by 333 (Galatasaray High School student number) Şevki Ege. This was replaced in 1925 by the current &quot;Ghayn-Sin&quot; crest, designed by Ayetullah Emin.

==Team colours and kit==
Galatasaray wore red and white colours when founded, then played in yellow and black during the 1907–1908 season.

For a match against the football team of the Royal Navy cruiser , played on 8 December 1908, Galatasaray finally settled on playing in red and yellow.

Ali Sami Yen, the main founder of Galatasaray, wrote the following in his diaries:

&quot;Our goalkeeper Asım Tevfik, left-forwarder Emin Bülent and right midfielder Ali Sami Yen were commissioned for the task of determining the new team colours. After we had been in and out of several shops, we saw two different elegant-looking wool materials in Fat Yanko&#x27;s store at Bahçekapısı (between Eminönü and Sirkeci in Istanbul, now called Bahçekapı). One of them was quite dark red, resembling the cherry colour, and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange. When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us of the beauty of a goldfinch. We thought we were looking at the colours flickering in burning fire. We were picturing the yellow-red flames shining on our team and dreaming that it would take us to victories. Indeed it did.&quot;

The red and yellow colours were also inspired from the roses which Gül Baba offered to Sultan Bayezid II.

===Stadiums===
Galatasaray played during its first years in different fields, since there were not any stadiums in Istanbul. In 1921, the first stadium, Taksim Stadium opened. Galatasaray played there until 1940. When the historic Taksim Stadium was demolished, Galatasaray decided to build a large, modern stadium. Due to difficulties stemming from World War II, construction was delayed for over two decades. In this period, they played in İnönü Stadium.

On 20 December 1964, Ali Sami Yen Stadium opened. It was named after the founder of the club, Ali Sami Yen and was in the Mecidiyeköy quarter of the Şişli district at the center of the city. In 1964, the stadium had a capacity of over 35,000. Due to improvements in security and prohibition of standing spectators, it had an all-seater capacity of 24,990 and was nicknamed &quot;Hell&quot;.

After 2002, when Atatürk Olympic Stadium was built for Istanbul&#x27;s Olympic Games bid, Galatasaray started to play European Cup matches there. The attendance record for a Turkish stadium was broken there, in a Galatasaray–Olympiacos match played in front of 79,414 spectators. But the Ali Sami Yen Stadium had historic importance for Galatasaray fans although it was smaller and older.

The new Nef Stadium was built for Galatasaray in return for the highly valued land of the historic Ali Sami Yen stadium in Mecidiyekoy, and became the new home ground for Galatasaray S.K., replacing the old Ali Sami Yen Stadium. The new stadium has a capacity of 52,695 seats. The Ali Sami Yen Stadium was demolished in 2011 with the contractor revealing that it was on the verge of collapse and that a major stadium disaster would almost certainly have occurred had the stadium remained in use

Since 1998, after every goal scored by Galatasaray, the last part of the song &quot;I Will Survive&quot; by the Hermes House Band is played. Although the song is in English and already adopted by Dutch football team Feyenoord, the part used has no lyrics except &quot;la la la la&quot;. This makes it easy for fans to participate.

In addition, before every game the Florida State Seminoles&#x27; war chant is played accompanied by what the fans call a &quot;scarf show&quot;, where fans display and wave their Galatasaray scarves.

<text>The Dreyfus Affair began when a &quot;bordereau&quot; (detailed memorandum) offering to procure French military secrets was recovered by French agents from the waste paper basket of Maximilian Von Schwartzkoppen, the military attaché at the German Embassy in Paris. Blame was quickly pinned upon Alfred Dreyfus, a young French artillery officer who was in training within the French Army&#x27;s general staff.

==French espionage==
Among the military services reorganized after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 was that of the French Counter Intelligence Department (disguised under the name of &quot;Section de Statistique&quot;) led by a Lt Col Jean Conrad Sandherr. It watched the German embassy as one of its principal occupations. The ambassador, Count Münster, had promised on his word of honor that his attachés would abstain from bribing the French officers or officials. However, it was known at the &quot;Section de Statistique&quot; that the new attaché, Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, probably without the knowledge of the ambassador, continued to pay spies and was in direct correspondence with the War Office in Berlin. According to indications furnished by a former Spanish military attaché, Valcarlos, Schwartzkoppen and the Italian military representative, Colonel Panizzardi, had agreed to exchange the results of whatever discoveries they might make.

To keep an eye on this plotting, the Counter Intelligence Office (the&quot;Section de Statistique&quot;) secured the help of a cleaning lady employed at the German Embassy, a certain Marie Bastian. Madame Bastian, wife of a soldier of the Republican Guard, was &quot;a vulgar, stupid, completely illiterate woman about 40 years in age,&quot; according to her boss. However she was of Alsatian descent and spoke German fluently. She was hired as a cleaning woman in the office of the German military attaché, Schwartzkoppen. Madame Bastian carefully collected all the scraps of paper, torn up or half-burnt, which she found in the waste-paper baskets or in the fireplace of Schwartzkoppen&#x27;s office. She put them all in a paper bag, and once or twice a month took them or had them taken to the &quot;Section de Statistique.&quot; There the pieces were carefully fitted together and gummed. By this means it was ascertained that, since 1892, certain secret information concerning the national defense had leaked out. Eventually, the conclusion was reached at high levels in the French General Staff that a traitor was passing on confidential military information to the German Embassy in Paris.

==The anonymous letter==

During the summer of 1894 a document arrived at the French Counter Intelligence Office which was far more alarming than any which had preceded it. It had been retrieved by French spy and cleaning lady Marie Bastian from the waste paper basket of the military attache at the German Embassy, Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen. It was a handwritten list of potentially available and highly sensitive French military documents. It was unsigned and has since become uniquely celebrated under the name of the &quot;bordereau.&quot; This list, written on so-called &quot;papier pelure&quot; (thin notepaper), ruled in squares and almost transparent, was torn from top to bottom in two places, but was otherwise intact. The hand written text was present on both sides of the page.

According to the official version, which was long believed to be the true one, the paper had arrived by the usual means, through Madame Bastian; but the appearance of the document, which was hardly torn, makes this story unlikely. It would appear from other disclosures that the letter was taken intact from the letter-box of Colonel Schwartzkoppen in the porter&#x27;s lodge at the embassy, and brought to the office by an agent named Brucker, who had formerly acted as a go-between of Madame Bastian and French counter intelligence. The detailed documents that this letter announced as having been sent to the German Embassy, along with the original envelope of the initial &quot;bordereau&quot; letter were never found. Here is a translation of this famous document from its French original:

: &quot;Being without information as to whether you desire to see me, I send you nevertheless, monsieur, some interesting information, viz&quot;.:

: &quot;1. A note concerning the hydraulic brake of the 120, and the way this gun has performed.&quot; [This phrase is a reference to the hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism of a field gun called &quot;120mm court Modele 1890 Baquet.&quot; It was a heavy field-piece, recently introduced into French artillery service; the mechanism of its hydraulic plus compressed-air short-recoil brake mechanism was quite novel for the time. But according to Touzin and Vauvillier (2006) as quoted from &quot;Les materiels de l&#x27;Armee Francaise (Les canons de la Victoire 1914–18)&quot;: &quot;...the 120mm Baquet Mle 1890 was far from being entirely satisfactory&quot;. As a matter of published record, only two hundred and ten (210) Mle 1890 120mm Baquet field guns were eventually built. Conversely, and precisely at the same time as the discovery of the &quot;&quot; in the summer of 1894, the first successful prototype of the highly advanced long-recoil Mle 1897 French 75 field gun had just been tested in great secrecy. Ultimately, over 20,000 French 75&#x27;s had been built by 1918.]

: &quot;2. A note upon the &#x27;troupes de couverture&#x27; (some modifications will be carried out, according to the new plan).&quot; [This referred to troops that would be called to the frontier at the commencement of mobilization. They were destined to &quot;cover&quot; the concentration of the rest of the army; hence their name. The &quot;new plan&quot; is the plan No. XIII. adopted in 1895.]

: &quot;3. A note concerning a modification in the formations of artillery.&quot; [Most likely the &quot;formations de manœuvre,&quot; which were just about to be altered by the new regulations.]

: &quot;4. A note relative to Madagascar.&quot; [The War Office was preparing an expedition to conquer that island.]

: &quot;5. The proposed &#x27;manuel de tir&#x27; of field-artillery manual (March 14, 1894).&quot; [See below]

: &quot;This document is exceedingly difficult to get hold of, and I can have it at my disposal for only a very few days. The minister of war has distributed a certain number of copies among the troops, and the corps are held responsible for them.&quot;

: &quot;Each officer holding a copy is required to return it after the maneuvers.&quot;

: &quot;Therefore if you will glean from it whatever interests you, and let me have it again as soon as possible, I will manage to obtain possession of it. Unless you would prefer that I have it copied in extenso, and send you the copy.&quot;

: &quot;I am just starting for the maneuvers.&quot;

: &quot;–D.&quot; [The initial was taken to be Dreyfus&#x27;]

This communication was clearly written in August, 1894, at the latest. The &quot;manuel de tir&quot; for field-artillery is the résumé of the methods used to regulate the actual firing of ordnance on the battle-field; this shooting never takes place during the grand maneuvers in September but only during the &quot;écoles à feu,&quot; which begin in May and finish in August. It is these &quot;écoles à feu&quot; that the writer incorrectly translates as &quot;maneuvers,&quot; and the word probably has the same meaning in the last sentence.

It seems evident that the bordereau was handed over to Major Henry, who, with Major Cordier, was then assisting Colonel Sandherr, the head of the military counter-intelligence section at the French War Ministry. According to General Auguste Mercier, the letter in question arrived at the office with other documents whose dates ranged from August 21 to September 2. It is probable that Henry kept the &quot;bordereau&quot; in his possession for a considerable time, making it all the more surprising that he did not recognize the undisguised writing of one of his former fellow officers, Major Esterhazy. It was not until September 24 that he spoke about the document to his close associates and to his chief, Colonel Sandherr. Sandherr immediately informed the head of the French general staff, General de Boisdeffre, and the secretary of war, General Auguste Mercier. They concluded that the informant of the German military attaché was a French officer, and furthermore, from the tone and diverse informations in the &quot;bordereau&quot;, that he probably was an officer in the General Staff. Nothing justified this last supposition. On the contrary, the technically and grammatically incorrect wording, the difficulty which the author had in procuring the &quot;manuel de tir&quot; (which was distributed freely among artillerymen), and the inflated importance which the informant appeared to attach to his disclosures, all pointed to the suspected informant as not being a staff-officer.

==Investigation==
Nevertheless, this &quot;first falsehood,&quot; suggested perhaps by the previous warnings of Valcarlos, was generally accepted; right from the start, the investigations led down a false path. At first no result was obtained from an examination of handwritings in the bureaus of the department. But on October 6 Lieutenant-Colonel d&#x27;Aboville suggested to his chief, Colonel Fabre, the idea that the bordereau, dealing as it did with questions which were under the jurisdiction of different departments, must be the work of one of the officers going through their &quot;stage&quot; (i.e., staff-schooling), they being the only men who passed successively through the various branches to complete their military education; moreover as, out of the five documents mentioned, three had reference to artillery, the officer probably belonged to this branch of the army. It remained only to consult the list of officers in training with the General Staff who had also come from the artillery. While looking through it, the two colonels came to a halt before the name of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, an officer professing the Jewish faith and with family roots in Mulhouse, Alsace a province which had become German in 1871. Captain Dreyfus, who was raised in Paris, was an alumnus of the elite Ecole Polytechnique and a promising young officer. In fact he had been placed in this much coveted temporary assignment on the General Staff as a step up the promotional ladder. However Dreyfus had been in the office of Colonel Fabre during the second quarter of 1893, and Fabre remembered having given him a bad record on the report of Lieutenant-Colonel Roget and Major Bertin-Mourot. Dreyfus had given these gentlemen the impression (upon the most superficial grounds) of presumption and overbearing, and of neglecting the routine of service to go into matters which were kept secret. Fabre and D&#x27;Aboville immediately began to search for papers bearing the writing of Dreyfus. By coincidence the writing of Dreyfus showed a likeness to the writing of the bordereau. These officers, inexperienced and prejudiced, mistook a vague resemblance for real identity.

==Arrest==
From the end of 1892 to September, 1894, Dreyfus went through his &quot;stage&quot; in the Staff Office, receiving excellent reports from all hands, except Colonel Fabre. From 1 October 1894, he went through a placement (&quot;stage&quot;) in a body of troops, the Thirty-ninth Regiment of the Line, in Paris. His personal characteristics unfitting for command and his slightly foreign accent combined to prejudice people against him; he had also a rather haughty demeanor, associated little with his military companions, and appeared rather too self-confident. But his comrades and superiors, without being much attached to him, recognized his keen intelligence, his retentive memory and his remarkable capacity for work; he was known as a well-informed officer, a daring and vigorous horseman, with decided opinions, which he knew how to set forth skillfully and to uphold in discussion. In short, he was a brilliant and correct soldier, and seemed marked out for a glorious future. Added to all this, he possessed a comfortable private fortune (which brought him an income of $5,000 or $6,000 a year) soundly invested in his brothers&#x27; business; he was without any expensive vices, if not without failings, and was leading a settled life. It is difficult to imagine what motive could possibly have incited him to espionage.

His patriotic sentiments were fervent almost to the point of Jingoism. He had also come under the influence of the Boulangist movement, which, for many of his equals, meant revenge on Germany. Antisemitism appears to have been behind the idea that he was a traitor. Even the wording of the listing slip (&quot;bordereau&quot;) should have shown the absurdity of this supposition: Dreyfus would not have written, &quot;I am just starting for the maneuvers,&quot; since that year none of the &quot;stage&quot; officers went to the maneuvers, having been officially advised by a circular on 17 May not to do so.

Without pausing to consider these objections, Fabre and D&#x27;Aboville took their &quot;discovery&quot; to General Gonse, deputy-chief of the staff, and to Colonel Sandherr, an anti-Semite of long standing. General de Boisdeffre, informed in his turn, told the story to the secretary of war. General Auguste Mercier had held this office since December, 1893. Brought face to face with the &quot;bordereau&quot;, his concern was to act swiftly, because, if the affair came to be known before he had taken any steps, he would be reproached for having shielded a traitor. This fear, and perhaps the hope of being able to pose as the savior of his country, decided him; once started he was forced to pursue the matter. However, he sought the opinion (October 11) of a small council formed of the president of the cabinet (Charles Dupuy), the minister of foreign affairs (Hanotaux), the minister of justice (Guérin), and himself.

The council authorized Mercier to proceed to a careful inquiry; he ordered an examination by an expert in handwriting. The matter was entrusted to Gobert, an expert Forensic document examiner of the Bank of France, who had been recommended to him. With great conscientiousness Gobert pointed out the striking differences between the writing of the &quot;bordereau&quot; and that of the documents which were given to him for comparison, the &quot;personal folio&quot; of Dreyfus, from which his name had been erased but the dates left, so that it was easy to identify him from the army list. There were some letters which struck the experienced eye at once, such as the open g (made like a y) and the double s made in the form ſs, features which were to be found only in the &quot;bordereau&quot;.

Gobert concluded (13 October) &quot;that the anonymous letter might be from a person other than the one suspected.&quot; This opinion was pronounced &quot;neutral&quot;; a second inquiry was called for, and this time the qualifications of the &quot;expert&quot; for the task were doubtful. Alphonse Bertillon, head of the &quot;service de l&#x27;identité judiciaire&quot; at the Prefecture of Police, had already been entrusted with certain photographic enlargements of the bordereau. Bertillon, who already knew the identity of the suspected man, sent in his report the same day. His inference was as follows: &quot;If we set aside the idea of a document forged with the greatest care, it is manifestly evident that the same person has written all the papers given for examination, including the incriminating document.&quot; Sheltered by this opinion, Mercier no longer hesitated to order the arrest of Dreyfus. The arrest was conducted in a melodramatic fashion, according to the plans of Major Mercier du Paty de Clam, who, as an amateur graphologist, had been involved from the very beginning in all the details of the affair.

Dreyfus was ordered to appear before the minister of war on the morning of 15 October, dressed in civilian clothes, under pretense of an &quot;inspection of the &#x27;stage&#x27; officers.&quot; He answered the summons without suspicion. In the office of the head of staff, he found himself in the presence of Du Paty and three others, also in civilian dress, whom he did not know at all; they were Gribelin (the archivist of the Intelligence Office), the &quot;chef de la sûreté,&quot; Cochefert, and the latter&#x27;s secretary. While awaiting the general, Du Paty, pretending that he had hurt his finger, asked Dreyfus to write from his dictation a letter which he wished to present for signature. The wording was most extraordinary; it was addressed to an unknown person, and asked him to send back the documents which had been lent to him by the writer before &quot;starting for the maneuvers&quot;; then followed the enumeration of these documents, taken word for word from the bordereau. Du Paty had flattered himself that the culprit, on recognizing the words, would confess; a loaded revolver lay on a table to allow him to execute justice upon himself.

Things did not turn out as Du Paty had expected. Dreyfus wrote tranquilly on under the major&#x27;s dictation. There was a moment when Du Paty, who was watching him closely, imagined he saw his hand tremble, and remarked sharply upon it to Dreyfus, who replied, &quot;My fingers are cold.&quot; The facsimile of the letter shows no sign of disturbance in the writing, hardly even a slight deviation. After having dictated a few more lines, during which &quot;Dreyfus entirely regained his composure,&quot; he ceased the experiment, and placing his hand on the captain&#x27;s shoulder, he cried: &quot;In the name of the law I arrest you; you are accused of the crime of high treason!&quot; Dreyfus, in his stupefaction, hardly found words to protest his innocence. He pushed away the revolver indignantly, but allowed himself to be searched without resistance, saying: &quot;Take my keys, examine everything in my house; I am innocent.&quot; Du Paty and his associates assured him that a &quot;long inquiry&quot; made against him had resulted in &quot;incontestable proofs&quot; which would be communicated to him later on. Then he was placed in the hands of Major Henry, who had been listening from the next room, and whose mission it was to deliver him over to the military prison of Cherche-Midi. In the cab that took them there, Dreyfus renewed his protestations of innocence, and asserted that he had not even been told what the documents in question were, or to whom he was accused of having given them.

At Cherche-Midi Dreyfus was turned over to the governor of the prison, Major Forzinetti, who had received orders to keep his imprisonment secret, even from his chief, General Saussier – an unheard-of measure. Apparently, the minister had some doubts as to the guilt of Dreyfus, and did not wish to publish his arrest until the inquiry furnished decisive proofs.

The conduct of the inquiry was entrusted to Major Du Paty de Clam. Immediately after the arrest he went to see Madame Dreyfus, and ordered her, under the most terrible threats, to keep the matter secret, even from her brothers-in-law. He then made a minute search of the rooms, which furnished no evidence whatever: no suspicious document, no &quot;papier pelure&quot; (foreign notepaper) was found: nothing but well-kept accounts. A similar search made in the house of M. Hadamard (Dreyfus&#x27; father-in-law) ended in the same failure.

Du Paty repeatedly visited Dreyfus in prison. He made him write standing up, seated, lying down, in gloves — all without obtaining any characteristics identical to those of the &quot;bordereau&quot;. He showed him fragments of a photograph of that document, mixed up with fragments and photographs of Dreyfus&#x27; own handwriting. The accused distinguished them with very little trouble. Du Paty questioned him without obtaining any other result than protestations of innocence broken by cries of despair. The suddenness of the catastrophe, and the uncertainty in which he was left as to its cause, reduced the wretched man to such a terrible state of mind that his reason was threatened. For several days he refused to take any food; his nights passed like a frightful nightmare. The governor of the prison, Forzinetti, warned the minister of the alarming state of his prisoner, and declared to General de Boisdeffre that he firmly believed he was innocent.

Not until 29 October did Du Paty show the entire text of the bordereau to Dreyfus, and then he made him copy it. The prisoner protested more forcibly than ever that it was not his writing, and regaining all the clarity of his intellect when faced by a definite accusation, tried to prove to his interlocutor that out of five documents mentioned in the &quot;bordereau&quot;, three were absolutely unknown to him.

He asked to see the minister: consent was given only on condition that &quot;he start on the road to a confession&quot;. In the meantime, writing experts had proceeded with further examinations. Bertillon, to whom the name of the prisoner had now been revealed, set to work again. To explain at the same time the resemblances and the differences between the writing of Dreyfus and that of the bordereau, he said that Dreyfus must have imitated or traced his own handwriting, leaving enough of its natural character for his correspondent to recognize it, but introducing into it, for greater safety, alterations borrowed from the hands of his brother Mathieu Dreyfus and his sister-in-law Alice, in one of whose letters they had discovered the double s made as in the &quot;bordereau&quot;. This is the hypothesis of &quot;autoforgery&quot;, which he complicated later on by a supposed mechanism of &quot;key-words&quot;, of &quot;gabarits,&quot; of measurements by the &quot;kutsch&quot;, of turns and twists. Bertillon&#x27;s provisional report, submitted on 20 October, inferred that Dreyfus was guilty &quot;without any reservation whatever&quot;.

General Auguste Mercier, still not satisfied, had the prefect of police appoint three new experts, Charavay, Pelletier, and Teyssonnières; Bertillon was put at their disposal to furnish them with photographic enlargements. Pelletier simply studied the &quot;bordereau&quot; and the documents given for comparison, and concluded that the writing of the &quot;bordereau&quot; was in no way disguised, and that it was not that of the prisoner. The two others, influenced by Bertillon, declared themselves in favor of the theory of identity. Teyssonnières, an expert of no great repute, spoke of feigned writing. Charavay, a distinguished paleographer, judged the prisoner guilty, unless it was a case of &quot;sosie en écritures&quot; – a most extraordinary resemblance of handwriting. He also spoke of simulation to explain away the palpable differences. On 31 October Du Paty finished his inquiry, and handed in his report, which accused Dreyfus but left it to the minister to decide what further steps should be taken. By this time General Mercier was no longer free to decide; the press had interfered. On 28 October Papillaud, a contributor to the &quot;Libre Parole&quot;, received a note signed &quot;Henry&quot; – under which pseudonym he recognized without hesitation the major of that name; &quot;Henry&quot; revealed to him the name and address of the arrested officer, adding falsely, &quot;All Israel is astir.&quot;

The next day the &quot;Libre Parole&quot; publicized the secret arrest of an individual suspected of espionage. Other newspapers were more precise; days later, on 1 November, the anti-Semitic newspaper founded by Edouard Drumont announced the arrest of &quot;the Jewish officer A. Dreyfus&quot;; there was, it declared, &quot;absolute proof that he had sold our secrets to Germany&quot;; and what was more, he had &quot;made full confession.&quot; All this was very awkward for General Mercier. It was too late to drop the case; he would have risked his position as a minister. He summoned a council of ministers, and, without revealing any other charge than that concerning the bordereau, declared that the documents mentioned in the memorandum could have been procured by only Dreyfus. The ministers, most of whom were hearing the story for the first time, unanimously decided to institute proceedings. The papers were made over to the governor of Paris, who gave the order to investigate.

No sooner had the name of Dreyfus been pronounced than the military attachés of Germany and Italy began to wonder if he had been in direct correspondence with the War Office of either country. They made inquiries in Berlin and Rome, and received answers in the negative. In his impatience, Panizzardi had telegraphed in cipher on 2 November: &quot;If Captain Dreyfus has had no intercourse with you, it would be to the purpose to let the ambassador publish an official denial, in order to forestall comments by the press.&quot; This telegram, written in cipher, and of course copied at the post office, was sent to the Foreign Office to be deciphered. The first attempt left the last words uncertain; they were thus translated: &quot;our secret agent is warned.&quot; This version, communicated to Colonel Sandherr, seemed to him a new proof against Dreyfus. But a few days later the real interpretation was discovered, of which Sandherr himself established the accuracy by a decisive verification. From that time it became morally impossible to bring home to Captain Dreyfus any document which would infer that the traitor was in communication with Panizzardi.

==Judicial inquiry==
The judicial inquiry had been entrusted to Major Bexon d&#x27;Ormescheville, judge-advocate of the first court martial of the Seine &quot;département&quot;. Comrades of Dreyfus said that they remembered, or thought they remembered, that in his past conduct he had shown signs of excessive curiosity. One officer testified that he had lent him the &quot;manuel de tir&quot; for several days, but that was in July, whereas the bordereau was now believed to have been written in April. An agent named Guénée, charged by Major Henry with the task of inquiring into the question of his morals, picked up a collection of tales which represented Dreyfus as a gambler and a libertine, whose family had been obliged several times to pay his debts. Another inquiry by the Prefecture of Police showed the inanity of these allegations: Dreyfus was unknown in gambling-houses, and Guénée&#x27;s informants had confused him with one of his numerous namesakes. There was no visible motive; the accusation rested solely on the disputed handwriting.

However, public opinion had already condemned him. The press claimed that Dreyfus had exposed the system of national defense. All the treachery that had remained untraced was blamed on him. People were indignant that the penalty of death for political crimes had been abolished by the constitution of 1848; even death seemed too light a punishment. The only excuse that they found for him was that his race had predisposed him to commit an act of treason, the &quot;fatalité du type.&quot;

The yellow press also blamed the minister of war, for keeping the arrest a secret, in the hope of being able to hush up the affair; he was said to be in league with &quot;the Jews&quot;. General Mercier now understood that the condemnation of Dreyfus was a question of his own political life or death; convinced or not, he determined to establish the man&#x27;s guilt. On November 28, he declared in an interview with &quot;Le Figaro&quot; that Dreyfus&#x27; guilt was &quot;absolutely certain.&quot; Then, aware of the defects of the evidence, he ordered that a secret dossier should be prepared by collecting from the drawers of the Intelligence Department whatever documents concerning spies could more or less be ascribed to Dreyfus. This dossier, revised and put into a sealed envelope by Mercier himself, with the cooperation of Boisdeffre and of Sandherr, was to be communicated only to the judges in the room where they held their deliberations, without either the accused or his counsel having been able to see it.

As soon as it had become known that General Mercier had decided to pursue the matter, public opinion changed in his favor. &quot;One must be for Mercier or for Dreyfus,&quot; proclaimed General Riu. Cassagnac, who, as a personal friend of Dreyfus&#x27; lawyer, maintained some doubts as to his guilt, summed up the situation in these words: &quot;If Dreyfus is acquitted, no punishment would be too severe for Mercier!&quot;

<text>While Alfred Dreyfus was serving his sentence on Devil&#x27;s Island, in France a number of people began to question his guilt. The most notable of these was Major Georges Picquart.

==Colonel Picquart==
Not long after the condemnation of Alfred Dreyfus, the military counter-intelligence section at the French War Ministry had a change of leadership. Lt Col Jean Conrad Sandherr, incapacitated by illness, resigned from the post simultaneously with his assistant, Cordier on 1 July 1895. Georges Picquart, who had been in charge of reporting the proceedings of the Dreyfus case to the War Minister and to his chief of staff, received the appointment to fill Sandherr&#x27;s position. Picquart was a young and brilliant officer, of Alsatian origin, hard-working and well-informed, with a clear intellect. He had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 6 April 1896, the youngest officer of that grade in the army.

Immediately upon his arrival, he reorganized the service, which had been neglected during the prolonged illness of Sandherr. He required that the paper bags Madame Marie Bastian used to collect the waste papers from the German embassy (which she had previously brought to Major Henry) to pass through his hands before being given to Captain Lauth, whose work it was to review them. These bags, however, never brought anything of importance to light, except that the leakage of secret information had not ceased since the condemnation of Dreyfus.

== The &quot;petit bleu&quot; ==
The chief of the staff, Raoul Le Mouton de Boisdeffre, told Picquart that in his opinion the Dreyfus affair was not definitively settled. They believed that they must be on the lookout for a counter-attack from the Jews. In 1894, they had not been able to discover a motive for the treason; there was therefore every reason for continuing the search to &quot;strengthen the dossier.&quot;

In March 1896, Commandant Henry made only short and infrequent visits to Paris. One day he sent Madame Bastian&#x27;s paper bag, particularly bulky on this occasion, to Picquart without looking at the contents. Picquart, also without inspecting it, passed it on to Lauth. Lauth later brought his chief a pneumatic tube telegram (commonly known as a &quot;petit bleu&quot;), the fragments of which he had found in the bag; pasted together, they contained the following words:

&quot;To Major Esterhazy, 27 Rue de la Bienfaisance, Paris.&quot;

&quot;Sir: I am awaiting first of all a more detailed explanation [than] that which you gave me the other day on the subject in question. Consequently I beg you to send it to me in writing that I may judge whether I can continue my relations with the firm R. or not. C.&quot;

The writing of this note was disguised, but the place it came from left no room for doubt that it came from Colonel Max von Schwartzkoppen; the office possessed another document, known to have been written by him, and signed with the same initial &quot;C.&quot; The &quot;petit bleu&quot; had not been sent by mail; apparently, after having written or dictated it, Schwartzkoppen decided not to send it and threw it away, taking care to tear it up into more than fifty very small pieces. He had not foreseen the patient industry of the Intelligence Department.

Captain Lauth felt the note might mean that there was another traitor among the officers. Picquart shared his impression; but determined to avoid the indiscretions and blunders which had been committed in 1894, he decided to secretly investigate himself before spreading the news of the discovery. He put the &quot;petit bleu&quot; away in his strong-box, and shortly afterward had photographs of it taken by Lauth.

==Major Esterhazy==
Picquart began by getting information about the personality of Major Esterhazy, to whom the &quot;petit bleu&quot; was addressed. He spoke to his friend Major Curé, one of Esterhazy&#x27;s fellow soldiers.

He discovered that Esterhazy had been under suspicion of malversation in Tunis and of espionage; he learned that Major Esterhazy was constantly absent from his garrison. He learned that Esterhazy collected information on confidential military questions, particularly those concerning mobilization and artillery. Esterhazy attended artillery tests, and when he could not succeed in being ordered to attend he went there at his own expense. This is what he had done notably in 1894, the year of the discovery of the bordereau, whose alleged writing cost Dreyfus the condemnation. He also borrowed books and documents, and had them copied by his secretaries.

== Picquart&#x27;s investigations ==
At first Picquart did not establish any connection in his own mind between the &quot;petit bleu&quot; and the bordereau; he simply thought he was on the track of a fresh traitor, and hoped to catch him in the act. However, Esterhazy had been warned, and not only was it impossible to surprise him in any compromising visit, but he showed himself openly at the German embassy, to which he went to ask for a passport for his colonel. He insisted that he be allowed to return to the War Office, in preference to the Intelligence Department, and was able to attain the post through the highest parliamentary and military influence.

However, a fresh incident occurred to strengthen Picquart&#x27;s suspicions. The French military attaché at Berlin, Foucault, informed him of a curious conversation he had had with Richard Cuers, a spy who wavered between France and Germany. Cuers told Foucault that Germany had never employed Dreyfus, that the only French officer who was in Germany&#x27;s pay was a major of infantry who had furnished some sheets from lectures held at the shooting school at Châlons.

== The secret dossier ==
Picquart told General de Boisdeffre about his discovery, and upon the order of the general and of the minister of war, Jean-Baptiste Billot, he was directed to continue his inquiry as quietly as possible. Boisdeffre did not seem to be interested in pursuing the case. If Esterhazy were really a traitor, he would be dismissed from the army quietly; another Dreyfus affair was to be avoided. Picquart now set to work in earnest to get samples of Esterhazy&#x27;s handwriting, and he succeeded in obtaining two letters which the major had written. On looking at them Picquart discovered that the writing was identical with that of the bordereau attributed to Dreyfus. He wished to make sure of his impression, so he showed some photographs of these letters to Armand du Paty de Clam and Alphonse Bertillon.

Du Paty declared: &quot;They are from Matthew Dreyfus&quot;; Bertillon said: &quot;It is the writing of the bordereau.&quot; And when Picquart told him the letters were of recent date, he declared: &quot;The Jews have, for the past year, been training some one to imitate the writing; he has succeeded in making a perfect reproduction.&quot;

Picquart realised that if Esterhazy, as the handwriting seemed to indicate, were the author of the bordereau, Dreyfus must be the victim of a judicial error. He obtained the secret dossier communicated to the judges in 1894, and which had been stored since then in Henry&#x27;s safe. He discovered that the documents in the dossier contained absolutely nothing that applied, or could be made to apply, to Dreyfus. Of the only two papers that were of any importance, one, the document &quot;canaille de D ...,&quot; did not in any way concern any officer, but only someone who had assumed the name of Dubois, while the other, the memorandum of Schwartzkoppen, almost certainly pointed to Esterhazy. Du Paty&#x27;s commentary was a mass of wild suppositions. Later this commentary was claimed by General Mercier as his private property and quietly destroyed by him.

Picquart immediately drew up a report and brought it to Boisdeffre, who ordered Picquart to relate his story to the deputy-chief of the staff, Charles Arthur Gonse. The general received Picquart, listened to his revelations, and concluded that they must &quot;separate the two affairs&quot;, that of Dreyfus and that of Esterhazy. These instructions, confirmed by Boisdeffre, seemed absurd to Picquart, since the bordereau established an indissoluble bond between the two cases; he should have understood from that moment that his superiors had determined not to permit the reopening of the Dreyfus affair.

==General Billot==
Most of the officers involved in the case were afraid that they would lose their positions in the military if they publicly confessed the part they had taken in the mistaken conviction of Dreyfus in 1894 and the subsequent cover-up. General Billot, to whom Picquart, following Boisdeffre&#x27;s orders, made a complete report of the case, appeared deeply moved. He did not have any reason to defend the judgment of 1894, for he had had nothing to do with it, and learned for the first time the contents of the secret dossier. But he did not act.

Picquart meanwhile was unaware that in his own office he was spied upon, opposed, and deceived by his fellow workers, Henry, Lauth, and the archivist Félix Gribelin. One of them, Henry, had served with Esterhazy at the Intelligence Office, and had been his friend and debtor since 1876, although he pretended to know very little about him. If it is not certain that Henry was Esterhazy&#x27;s accomplice, it seems very probable that from the end of 1894 he knew him to be the author of the bordereau.

==The Castelin interpellation==
In September 1896, the false rumor of Dreyfus&#x27;s escape brought the case abruptly back to public notice. The anti-Jewish press inveighed against the accomplices, the protectors of the traitor; a member of the Chamber, André Castelin, announced that at the opening of the next session he would formally question the ministry on the subject. The Dreyfus family was pursuing an inquiry and was getting ready to publish a pamphlet demanding the revision of the case. Picquart believed Castelin was working for the Dreyfus family.

In early September Picquart came into possession of a strange forgery. It was a letter in a feigned handwriting written in the German style, pretending to be addressed to Dreyfus by a friend named Weiss or Weill, and referring to &quot;interesting documents&quot; written in invisible ink. This was probably the beginning of the plot to discredit Picquart. He insisted to General Gonse that the initiative should come from the Staff Office to investigate. Gonse answered by vaguely advising him to act with prudence, and was opposed to the &quot;expertises&quot; in handwriting that Picquart requested. On 14 September &quot;L&#x27;Eclair&quot; published a retrospective article under the title &quot;The Traitor&quot; which pretended to bring to light the real motives for the judgment of 1894. The article revealed for the first time the fact of the communication to the judges of a secret document, but this document – the letter &quot;canaille de D ...&quot; – now became a &quot;letter in cipher&quot; in which the following phrase was found: &quot;This creature Dreyfus is becoming decidedly too exacting.&quot; This article had been brought to &quot;L&#x27;Eclair&quot; by a contributor to the &quot;Petit Journal&quot;. Picquart attributed it to the Dreyfus family, and wanted to investigate, but his superiors would not allow it. This only caused him to insist more firmly that immediate steps should be taken. Then took place between General Gonse and Picquart this dialogue:

:&quot;What can it matter to you,&quot; said the general, &quot;whether this Jew remains at Devil&#x27;s Island or not?&quot;
:&quot;But he is innocent.&quot;
:&quot;That is an affair that can not be reopened; General Mercier and General Félix Gustave Saussier are involved in it.&quot;
:&quot;Still, what would be our position if the family ever found out the real culprit?&quot;
:&quot;If you say nothing, nobody will ever know it.&quot;
:&quot;What you have just said is abominable, General. I do not know yet what course I shall take, but in any case I will not carry this secret with me to the grave.&quot;

From that day Picquart&#x27;s removal was decided. He was authorized for the sake of appearances to continue his investigations concerning Esterhazy, but he was forbidden to take any decisive steps or to have Esterhazy arrested. Picquart found that ordinary measures – secret searches in his rooms, opening of his correspondence, examination of his desks – were of no avail, because Esterhazy had been warned.

==Henry&#x27;s confirmatory letter==
Meanwhile, Henry told General Gonse that it would be advisable to put the secret dossier of the Dreyfus case out of the way. Gonse removed the dossier on 30 October. A few days later Henry brought him a letter written in blue pencil from the Italian military attaché Alessandro Panizzardi which, he said, he had just found among some scraps in Madame Bastian&#x27;s paper bag on 31 October. The letter said:

:My dear friend: I have read that a deputy is going to ask several questions on the Dreyfus affair. If they request any new explanations at Rome, I shall say that I never had any dealings with this Jew. That is understood. If they question you make the same reply, for nobody must ever know what has happened to him. Alexandrine.

The writing was apparently Panizzardi&#x27;s, and in order to compare it Henry produced an earlier letter, supposed to have been taken from the waste of the secret dossier, written with the same pencil, on the same sort of paper ruled in squares, and containing the same signature. In reality, the letter brought for comparison contained fraudulent additions hinting at a Jewish traitor, while the new document was a complete forgery executed by one of Henry&#x27;s customary forgers named Lemercier-Picard, who later admitted to Count Tornielli that he had written it. Gonse and Boisdeffre believed or pretended to believe in its authenticity, and convinced General Billot. When Colonel Picquart expressed his doubts to Gonse, the latter answered: &quot;When a minister tells me anything I always believe it.&quot;

On 6 November, the memoir written by Bernard Lazare on behalf of the Dreyfus family appeared in Brussels. The memoir laid bare the inconclusive character of the incriminating document (without, however, publishing it), and affirmed, in opposition to &quot;L&#x27;Eclair,&quot; that it bore only the initial &quot;D&quot; and not the name &quot;Dreyfus&quot;. The pamphlet, distributed to the members of the Chamber, received a cold welcome from the press.

On 10 November, &quot;Le Matin&quot; published a facsimile of the bordereau attributed to Dreyfus. It had been obtained from the handwriting expert Teyssonnières, who had kept a photograph of the document. The publication of the facsimile allowed handwriting experts all over the world to prove the differences that existed between the writing of the bordereau and that of Dreyfus. Moreover, Esterhazy&#x27;s handwriting was recognized, particularly by Schwartzkoppen, by Maurice Weil, and by a solicitor&#x27;s clerk, the son of the chief rabbi Zadoc Kahn. Maurice Weil, one of Esterhazy&#x27;s intimate friends, sent to the minister of war an anonymous letter which he had just received and which warned him that Castelin intended to denounce Esterhazy and Weil as accomplices of Dreyfus.

The Staff Office blamed Picquart for these embarrassing facts coming into the open, and decided that his departure from the service should be arranged. Boisdeffre went with him to the minister, who rebuked Picquart soundly for having let information leak out and for having seized Esterhazy&#x27;s correspondence without authorization. In recognition of his past services he was not disgraced, but was ordered to set out immediately to inspect the intelligence service in the east of France, and to resign his position to General Gonse. He left on 16 November without protesting. Two days later Castelin&#x27;s interpellation was made, but it failed in its purpose. Castelin demanded that proceedings should be instituted against the accomplices of the traitor, among whom he named Dreyfus&#x27; father-in-law Hadamard, the naval officer Emile Weyl, and Bernard Lazare. General Billot, who had addressed the Chamber before Castelin, claimed the actions of 1894 had been perfectly legitimate, and made an appeal to the patriotism of the assembly to terminate a &quot;dangerous debate.&quot; After a short and confused argument the Chamber voted an &quot;ordre du jour&quot; of confidence, inviting the government to inquire into the matter and to take proceedings if there were cause. A petition from Madame Dreyfus was put aside by the judicial committee for want of sufficient proof.

==Machinations against Picquart==
Meanwhile, Picquart was sent from Nancy to Marseille, and later on to Tunis, where he was attached to the Fourth Regiment of sharpshooters in garrison at Sousse. General Gonse wrote to him upon the question of money, as if to suggest purchasing his silence. Picquart recorded the history of his discovery in a codicil to his will, which he intended for the president of the republic; in this way he was sure &quot;not to take his secret with him to the grave&quot;.

<text>After Major Georges Picquart&#x27;s exile to Tunisia others took up the cause of the Alfred Dreyfus.

==Henry&#x27;s forgeries==
Major Henry, though under the nominal direction of Gonse, had become the real head of the Intelligence Office, where he quietly prepared a whole series of forgeries, designed, when the opportunity presented itself, to crush Picquart if he ever attempted to cause trouble. After having put at rest the mistrust of his former chief by pretended protestations of devotion, in June, 1897, he suddenly flung off his mask. Picquart, irritated at continually receiving missives from the agents of his former service, wrote a rather hasty note to Henry, in which he denounced &quot;the lies and the mysteries&quot; with which his pretended mission had been surrounded during the past six months. Henry, after having consulted his superiors, answered, declaring that as far as &quot;mysteries&quot; were concerned he knew only that the following facts had been established against Picquart by an &quot;inquiry&quot;:
# The opening of correspondence unconnected with the service.
# A proposal to two officers to testify, should such action be necessary, that a paper, registered as belonging to the service, and emanating from a well-known person, had been seized in the mails – a reference to a remark made by Lauth to Picquart, that the &quot;petit bleu&quot; addressed to Esterhazy was lacking the regular stamp of the post-office.
# The opening of a secret dossier, followed by disclosures.

This letter, to which Picquart replied by a brief protest, opened his eyes; he understood the plot that was being hatched against him, the dangers which threatened him for having been too discerning. He asked for leave, went to Paris, and disclosed his affair to his old friend and comrade Leblois, a lawyer. Without revealing to Leblois any secret document, even the &quot;petit bleu,&quot; he told him that he had discovered Esterhazy&#x27;s crime and the innocence of Dreyfus; he authorized him, in case of necessity, to inform the government, but absolutely forbade him to apprise either the brother or the lawyer of Dreyfus. Leblois did not long remain the only recipient of the secret. A few days later chance brought him in contact with one of the few statesmen who had shown any sympathy with the researches of Matthew Dreyfus – the Alsatian Scheurer-Kestner, former member of the Chamber of Deputies for Alsace and coworker with Gambetta, and now vice-president of the Senate and one of the most justly esteemed men of the Republican party. Since 1895 Scheurer-Kestner, induced by the deputy Ranc and by Matthew Dreyfus, had made some inquiries. In 1897 the friends of Dreyfus returned to the charge. Scheurer-Kestner was surprised to find that all the so-called moral proofs, the tales that were brought forward to explain the crime of Dreyfus, did not bear investigation. The expert Teyssonnières, sent to him by his friend and colleague Trarieux, former minister of justice, did not succeed in convincing him that the bordereau was in the writing of Dreyfus. In great distress, he went to tell his old comrade Billot of his suspicions; the general reassured him: a secret document discovered since the condemnation, at the moment of Castelin&#x27;s interpellation, had removed all doubts; Billot related the substance of it to him without letting him see it. This &quot;crushing blow,&quot; which he kept in reserve for the partisans of Dreyfus, was Major Henry&#x27;s forgery.

==Scheurer-Kestner&#x27;s inquiries==
Scheurer-Kestner was at this point of his inquiry when Leblois, who had met him at dinner one evening, conceived the idea of having recourse to him as the medium by which to save Dreyfus and, through Dreyfus, Picquart. Going to Scheurer-Kestner&#x27;s house, Leblois told all he knew, and showed him Gonse&#x27;s letters. Scheurer-Kestner was finally convinced, and swore to devote himself to the defense of the innocent (July 13, 1897). But he was much puzzled as to what course to pursue. Leblois had forbidden him to mention Picquart&#x27;s name, and Picquart had forbidden that the Dreyfus family should be told. In this perplexity, born of the initial mistake of Picquart, Scheurer-Kestner pursued the most unlucky tactics imaginable; instead of quietly gathering together all his documents and uniting his forces with those of Matthew Dreyfus, he allowed the rumor of his convictions to be spread abroad, and thus put the Staff Office on the alert, gave them time to prepare themselves, and allowed the hostile press to bring discredit upon him and to weaken beforehand by premature and mutilated revelations the force of his arguments.

==Tactics of the Staff Office==
Billot soon began to feel uneasy; he conjured his &quot;old friend&quot; to do nothing without having seen him; that is to say, until the end of the parliamentary recess. Scheurer-Kestner, without suspecting anything, gave him his word, leaving a clear field to Esterhazy&#x27;s protectors. In the meantime this personage had been quietly dismissed from active service. Billot, who it is claimed looked upon him as &quot;a scoundrel, a vagabond,&quot; perhaps even as the accomplice of Dreyfus, had indignantly opposed his readmission into the War Office. On 17 August Esterhazy was put on the retired list &quot;for temporary infirmities&quot;; but, that done, there remained the prevention of his being &quot;substituted&quot; for Dreyfus. That it was Scheurer-Kestner&#x27;s plan to demand this substitution, the Staff Office did not doubt for a moment, for Henry&#x27;s secret police had followed Picquart to Leblois&#x27; house, and then Leblois to Scheurer-Kestner&#x27;s. It was even fancied that Scheurer-Kestner was much more fully informed than was really the case.

Toward the middle of October a meeting was held at the War Office, in anticipation of Scheurer-Kestner&#x27;s impending campaign. Gonse, Henry, Lauth, Du Paty de Clam, were all present; the last, although having nothing to do with the Intelligence Office, had been summoned to it as the principal worker in the condemnation of Dreyfus, and as interested therefore more than any one in maintaining it. Gonse set forth the plot &quot;of the Jews&quot; to substitute for Dreyfus Esterhazy, an officer of doubtful character, but whom a minute inquiry had cleared of all suspicion of treachery: who was, however, a nervous man, and who, under the blow of a sudden denunciation, might lose his head and take flight or even kill himself; and that would mean catastrophe, war, and disaster. Esterhazy must then be warned, to prevent him from going quite mad. But how was it to be done? It was decided to send him an anonymous letter in order that he might take courage. Billot objected to this proceeding; it seems, however, that somebody disregarded the objection, for Esterhazy received (or pretended to have received) a letter signed Espérance, warning him that the Dreyfus family, informed by a certain Colonel Picquart, intended to accuse him of treason. One fact is certain – that he settled in Paris, went to see Schwartzkoppen, and told him that all was lost if he (Schwartzkoppen) did not go and declare to Madame Dreyfus that her husband was guilty; on the indignant refusal of Schwartzkoppen he threatened to blow his brains out.

At the Staff Office Henry and Du Paty, understanding at once the wishes of Boisdeffre and of Gonse, resolved to join forces with Esterhazy. The keeper of the records, Gribelin, went in disguise to take a letter to Esterhazy fixing a rendezvous in the park of Montsouris. There, while Henry (fearing, as he said, recognition by his former comrade) kept watch, Du Paty, who was also disguised, told Esterhazy that he was known to be innocent, and that he would be defended on condition that he conformed rigorously to the instructions that would be given to him. After this interview, Esterhazy went to Schwartzkoppen quite cheered up, and told him that the staff was entering into a campaign for his defense. A week later Schwartzkoppen had himself recalled to Berlin; it was the discreet but significant avowal that &quot;his man was taken.&quot; Meanwhile, Esterhazy, as agreed upon, was receiving his daily instructions from the Staff Office. Every evening from this time on Gribelin brought to him at the Military Club the program for the next day; Du Paty and Henry, whose connection with the affair Esterhazy soon knew, saw him several times, sometimes at the Montmartre cemetery, sometimes on the Pont d&#x27;Alexandre III. Later on, when these meetings were considered too dangerous, they corresponded with him through the medium of his mistress, of his lawyer, or of his cousin Christian.

Following instructions, Esterhazy wrote to Billot, ending his letter with the threat that if he were not defended he would apply to the German emperor. He wrote in the same strain to the president of the republic, claiming that a lady, afterward mysteriously referred to as the &quot;veiled lady&quot;, had given him a photograph of a very important document which Picquart had acquired from an embassy and which seriously compromised persons of high diplomatic rank. This braggadocio was taken so seriously that General Leclerc received an order at Tunis to question Picquart on having given to an outsider – the &quot;veiled lady&quot; – the &quot;document of deliverance.&quot; Receiving no answer, Esterhazy, in his third letter (5 November), virtually held the knife at the president&#x27;s throat: the stolen document proved the rascality of Dreyfus; if he should publish it, it would be war or humiliation for France. This time they made up their minds to listen to him. General Saussier was charged with interrogating Esterhazy in regard to the &quot;document of deliverance&quot;; he obtained no details from him, but made him promise to send back the document to the minister. On 15 November (the day when Matthew Dreyfus wrote his denunciation) it was &quot;restored&quot; to Saussier in a triple envelope, sealed with Esterhazy&#x27;s arms: the &quot;document of deliverance,&quot; as Esterhazy called it, was a photograph of the document &quot;canaille de D . . .&quot; There is nothing to prove that Esterhazy had ever had it in his hands. Billot acknowledged the receipt by the hand of his &quot;chef de cabinet,&quot; General Torcy. By these barefaced stratagems Esterhazy and his defenders on the staff made certain of the complicity of the minister and of the president of the republic, while they compromised Picquart more deeply.

==The &quot;Speranza&quot; and &quot;Blanche&quot; telegrams==
With the latter they proceeded to further measures. At the end of October Boisdeffre had ordered General Leclerc, commanding the corps of occupation in Tunis, to send Picquart to reconnoitre on the frontier of Tripoli, from which quarter pretended gatherings of the local tribes were reported. It was a dangerous region, where Morès had met his death; General Leclerc was astonished at the order, and, having heard from Picquart the cause of his disgrace, forbade him to go farther than Gabes. Some days later Picquart had to clear himself of the accusation of allowing a woman to purloin the &quot;document of deliverance&quot; of Esterhazy. Then, on 11 November and 12 November, he received one after the other two telegrams worded: (1) &quot;Arrest the demigod; all is discovered; very serious affair. Speranza.&quot; (2) &quot;It has been proved that the &#x27;bleu&#x27; was forged by Georges. Blanche.&quot; The obscure allusions and the names in these forgeries were derived from Picquart&#x27;s private correspondence, which had been looked through, and were intended to produce the impression that Picquart was in some plot to release Dreyfus; the &quot;demigod,&quot; it was pretended, referred to Scheurer-Kestner. The two telegrams, copied before they left Paris, had convinced the Séreté Générale that Picquart was the moving spirit in the plot. On receiving them, and afterward an anonymous letter in the same style, Picquart sent a complaint to General Billot, and asked that inquiries be made regarding the author of these forgeries.

During this time Scheurer-Kestner was being deceived by his &quot;old friend&quot; Billot. On 30 October he had a long conference with Billot, at which he accused Esterhazy. Billot declared that in spite of persistent investigations nobody had been able to find any proofs against Esterhazy, but that there were positive proofs against Dreyfus. Scheurer-Kestner implored him to distrust suspicious documents, and finally gave him a fortnight in which to make an honest and thorough investigation, promising that he himself would not speak during that time.

==Silence of Scheurer-Kestner==
He kept his word; Billot did not. During the fortnight not only was the collusion between the staff and the traitor fully organized, but the press, furnished with more or less news by the War Office, spoke openly of Scheurer-Kestner&#x27;s futile visit to Billot and launched a veritable tempest against the &quot;Jewish syndicate,&quot; which had bought a &quot;man of straw&quot; as a substitute for Dreyfus in order to dishonor the army. Scheurer-Kestner, patient but much distressed by the tempest, persisted in his fixed idea of acting only through the government. He saw Méline, the president of the council, several times, but Méline would have nothing to do with his dossier, and advised him to address to the minister of justice a direct petition for revision. This was not bad advice. According to the new law of 1895, a petition for revision founded on a new fact (discovered after the sentence) could only be submitted to the Court of Cassation by the keeper of the seals, after the latter had taken the advice of a special commission. The disposition of the minister (Darlan) was not unfavorable to the adoption of this course; and it is worthy of note that the new facts which were allowed later by the court were at that moment easy to establish; namely, the resemblance between Esterhazy&#x27;s writing and that of the bordereau and the communication of the secret dossier to the judges.

==Conjunction of Matthew Dreyfus and Scheurer-Kestner==
The pursuit of such a course would also have had the advantage of taking the matter out of the hands of military justice and of placing it in those of the civil judges, who were less prejudiced. However, Scheurer-Kestner did not dare to pursue this course; he thought his documents not sufficiently complete. Official notes from the ministry (6 November and 9 November) stated the attitude which the government was resolved to take – it determined to respect the &quot;chose jugée&quot; (&quot;res judicata&quot;, the matter adjudicated). As for the legal proceedings to secure revision, the notice added that Captain Dreyfus had been &quot;regularly and justly&quot; condemned – a formula which soon became the burden of General Billot&#x27;s song. Matters might still have dragged on had it not been for chance. At the instance of the Dreyfus family, Bernard Lazare had prepared a second and more detailed pamphlet, in which had been gathered the opinions of a large number of French and foreign experts upon the writing of the bordereau as compared with that of Dreyfus. The unanimous conclusion of these experts was that the handwritings were not identical; but while some of them maintained that the writing of the bordereau was natural, others saw in it a forgery. At the same time that this brochure was published, Matthew Dreyfus ordered handbills reproducing in facsimile the bordereau and a letter of his brother&#x27;s, which were offered for sale. One of these handbills fell into the hands of a stockbroker, Castro, who had had business relations with Esterhazy; he immediately recognized the bordereau as the writing of his former client, and informed Matthew Dreyfus of the fact. The latter hastened to Scheurer-Kestner and asked him: &quot;Is that the same name?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; the latter replied (11 November).

For four days they hesitated as to the course to pursue, Scheurer-Kestner still persisting in keeping the fortnight&#x27;s silence promised to Billot on 31 October. In the interim, by means of the press the public mind had been influenced by indications as to the real traitor and by counter-declarations by Esterhazy in &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; concerning the conspiracy of the Jews and of &quot;X. Y.&quot; (Picquart).

On the night of 15 November, in a letter to the minister of war which was published at once, Matthew Dreyfus denounced &quot;Count&quot; Walsin Esterhazy as the writer of the bordereau and as the author of the treason for which his brother had been condemned.

==Trial of Esterhazy==
The hasty denunciation of Esterhazy by Matthew Dreyfus was a tactical though perhaps an unavoidable blunder. To accuse Esterhazy formally of the treason imputed to Dreyfus and not simply of having written the bordereau (perhaps as a hoax or a swindle) was to subject the revision of the case of 1894 to the preliminary condemnation of Esterhazy. With the staff and the War Office fully enlisted against Dreyfus, the court martial which Esterhazy himself at once demanded was of necessity a veritable comedy. Not only was the accused allowed his liberty until the last day but one, not only did his protectors in the Staff Office continue to communicate indirectly with him and to dictate the answers he should make, but the general entrusted with the preliminary as well as with the judicial inquiry, Georges-Gabriel de Pellieux, showed him an unchanging friendliness and accepted without examination all his inventions.

Convinced of the guilt of Dreyfus through the assurances of the staff, and before long by Henry&#x27;s forged documents, Pellieux refused at the outset to examine the bordereau, on the subject of which there was &quot;chose jugée.&quot; Even after the formal order to prosecute, an interpellation of Scheurer-Kestner to the Senate (7 December) was necessary to induce General Billot to promise that all the documents, including the famous bordereau, should be produced for examination. On this occasion also, as he had done some days before in the Chamber of Deputies (4 December), the minister did not fail to proclaim on his soul and conscience the guilt of Dreyfus, thus bringing to bear the whole weight of his high office on the verdict of the future judges of Esterhazy. Premier Méline, on his part, gained applause for declaring &quot;that there was no Dreyfus affair,&quot; and the Chamber in its &quot;ordre du jour&quot; stigmatized &quot;the ringleaders of the odious campaign which troubled the public conscience.&quot;

<text>Thomas Edward Watson (September 5, 1856 – September 26, 1922) was an American politician, attorney, newspaper editor, and writer from Georgia. In the 1890s Watson championed poor farmers as a leader of the Populist Party, articulating an agrarian political viewpoint while attacking business, bankers, railroads, Democratic President Grover Cleveland, and the Democratic Party. He was the nominee for vice president with Democrat William Jennings Bryan in 1896 on the Populist ticket.

Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1890, Watson pushed through legislation mandating Rural Free Delivery, called the &quot;biggest and most expensive endeavor&quot; ever instituted by the U.S. Postal Service. Politically, he was a leader on the left in the 1890s, calling on poor whites and poor blacks to unite against the elites. After 1900, he shifted to nativist attacks on blacks and Catholics, and after 1914 on Jews. He was elected to the United States Senate two years before his death, dying in office.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Thomas E. Watson was born September 5, 1856, in Thomson, the county seat of McDuffie County, Georgia. He was of entirely English descent. After attending Mercer University (he did not graduate; family finances forced withdrawal after two years), he became a school teacher. At Mercer University, Watson was part of the Georgia Psi chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Watson later studied law and was admitted to the Georgia bar in 1875. He joined the Democratic Party and in 1882 was elected to the Georgia Legislature.

As a state legislator, Watson struggled unsuccessfully to curb the abuses of the powerful railroad corporations. A bill subjecting railroads to county property taxes was voted down after U.S. Senator Joseph E. Brown offered to provide the legislators with round-trip train fares to the Louisville Exposition of 1883. In disgust, Watson resigned his seat and returned to the practice of law before his term expired. He was a presidential elector for the Democratic ticket of Grover Cleveland and Allen G. Thurman in the 1888 election.

===US Representative===
Watson began to support the Farmers&#x27; Alliance platform and was elected to the United States House of Representatives as an Alliance Democrat in 1890. He served in the House from 1891 until March 1893. In Congress, Watson was the only Southern Alliance Democrat to abandon the Democratic caucus, instead attending the first People&#x27;s Party congressional caucus. At that meeting, he was nominated for Speaker of the House by the eight Western Populist Representatives. Watson was instrumental in the founding of the Georgia Populist Party in early 1892.

The People&#x27;s Party advocated the public ownership of the railroads, steamship lines, and telephone and telegraph systems. It also supported the free and unlimited coinage of silver, the abolition of national banks, a system of graduated income tax and the direct election of United States senators. As a Populist, Watson tried to unite the agrarians across class lines, overcoming racial divides. He also supported the right of black men to vote. The failures of the Populists&#x27; attempt to make political progress through fusion tickets with the Democrats in 1896 and 1898 deeply affected Watson.

===Rural Free Delivery===
Watson, though a member of a minority faction in Congress, was nonetheless effective in passing landmark legislation. The most significant was a law to require the Post Office to deliver mail to remote farm families. Rural Free Delivery (RFD), legislation that Watson pushed through Congress in 1893, eliminated the need for individuals living in more remote homesteads to pick up mail, sometimes at distant post offices, or to pay private carriers for delivery. The legislation was opposed by private carriers, and by many small-town merchants who worried the service would reduce farm families&#x27; weekly visits to town to obtain goods and merchandise, or that mail order merchants selling through catalogs, such as Sears, Roebuck and Company might present significant competition. RFD became an official service in 1896. That year, 82 rural routes were put into operation. A massive undertaking, nationwide RFD service took several years to implement, and remains the &quot;biggest and most expensive endeavor&quot; ever instituted by the U.S. Postal Service.

===Political defeat, law, and publishing===

Watson campaigned for re-election but was defeated, leaving office in March 1893. In this period, regular Democrats worked to reduce the voting power of blacks and poor whites to prevent such coalitions as the Populists, or alliances with Republicans. Democrats controlled the state legislature: they passed laws to disfranchise blacks and were successful in pushing them off the voter rolls by such requirements as cumulative poll taxes (1877), literacy tests, and residency requirements. In 1908, Georgia also instituted white primaries, another way of excluding blacks in what had become a one-party state, where in 1900 African Americans made up 46.7% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;pop/perc&quot;&gt;Historical Census Browser, 1900 Federal Census, University of Virginia , accessed 15 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After being defeated, Watson returned to work as a lawyer in Thomson, Georgia. He also served as editor and business manager of the &quot;People&#x27;s Party Paper&quot;, published in Atlanta.

The masthead of Watson&#x27;s newspaper in 1894 declared that it &quot;is now and will ever be a fearless advocate of the Jeffersonian Theory of Popular Government, and will oppose to the bitter end the Hamiltonian Doctrines of Class Rule, Moneyed Aristocracy, National Banks, High Tariffs, Standing Armies and formidable Navies — all of which go together as a system of oppressing the people.&quot;

=== Vice presidential candidacy ===
In the 1896 presidential election the leaders of the Populist Party entered into talks with William Jennings Bryan, the proposed Democratic Party candidate. They were led to believe that Watson would become Bryan&#x27;s running mate. After the Populist 1896 convention nominated Bryan, the latter announced that Arthur Sewall, a more conservative banker from Maine, would be his vice presidential choice on the Democratic ticket.

This created a split in the Populist Party. Some refused to support Bryan, whereas others, such as Mary Lease, reluctantly campaigned for him. Watson&#x27;s name remained on the ballot as Bryan&#x27;s vice presidential nominee on the Populist Party ticket, while Sewall was listed as Bryan&#x27;s Democratic Party vice presidential nominee. Watson received 217,000 votes for vice president, less than a quarter of the number of votes received by the 1892 Populist ticket. However, Watson received more votes than any national Populist candidate from this time on.

Bryan&#x27;s defeat damaged the Populist Party. While Populists held some offices in Western states for several years, the party ceased to be a factor in Georgia politics.

===Shifting racial views===
Watson had long supported black enfranchisement in Georgia and throughout the South, as a basic tenet of his populist philosophy. He condemned lynching and tried to protect black voters from lynch mobs. However, after 1900 his interpretation of populism shifted. He no longer viewed the populist movement as being racially inclusive. By 1908, Watson identified as a white supremacist and ran as such during his presidential bid. He used his highly influential magazine and newspaper to launch vehement diatribes against blacks.

===Presidential candidacies===
Watson was nominated as the Populist Party&#x27;s candidate in 1904 and received 117,183 votes. This was double the Populist&#x27;s showing in 1900, but less than one-eighth of the party&#x27;s support from just 12 years earlier. The Populist Party&#x27;s fortunes declined in the 1908 presidential campaign, and Watson as the party&#x27;s standard bearer, with judge Samuel W. Williams as his running mate, attracted just 29,100 votes. While Watson never received more than 1% of the nationwide vote, he had respectable showings in selected Western and Southern states. In the 1904 and 1908 campaigns, Watson received 18% and 12% respectively in his home state of Georgia. After the 1908 campaign, the Populist Party was dissolved.

Watson denounced socialism, which had drawn many converts from the ashes of Populism. Retaining his rural Populist and nativist ideology, and responding to the view that eastern urban America was dominated by Catholics, Watson also became a vigorous anti-Catholic crusader.

===Later years===
Through his publications &quot;Watson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Jeffersonian&quot;, Watson continued to have great influence on public opinion, especially in his native Georgia.

In 1913 Watson played a prominent role through his newspaper in inflaming public opinion in the case of Leo Frank, a Jewish American factory manager who was accused of the murder of Mary Phagan, a 13-year-old factory worker.

===Antisemitic views===
When Frank was arrested in 1913, his wealthy family asked Watson to take on his legal defense, offering a substantial fee. Watson, who opposed the death penalty, &quot;enjoyed a formidable reputation&quot; as a defense attorney in capital cases. But he declined the offer. Historian Albert Lindemann wrote that &quot;Frank&#x27;s friends and family would not have approached Watson to defend Frank if Watson had been known to be anti-Semitic.&quot;

At that point in Watson&#x27;s life, &quot;he had repeatedly expressed friendly words for Jews in his various publications, and Jewish merchants, even if hostile to [Watson&#x27;s Populist political views], had regularly bought advertising space in those publications&quot;. Watson&#x27;s taste for sensationalism was fully expressed in his publications&#x27; coverage of Frank&#x27;s trial. Yet it &quot;rarely and only in inconsequential ways touched upon Jews&quot;. After Frank&#x27;s conviction, and for the next year, during the appeals process, Watson &quot;scrupulously refrained from comment about the case&quot;.

Then in March 1914, an editorial in the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; demanded a new trial for Frank. The &quot;Journal&quot; was widely regarded as the organ of Watson&#x27;s bitter political rival U.S. Senator Hoke Smith, who was up for re-election. Watson&#x27;s hatred of Smith was &quot;a blinding obsession&quot;. He thought that the &quot;Journal&quot; editorial showed that Smith was receiving &quot;Jewish money&quot; to champion Frank&#x27;s cause, so Watson determined to disgrace Smith. For many years he had attacked the Catholic Church; now he began a campaign against rich Jews and Northerners who were, in his view, trying to free a murderer. In this effort he pulled out all the stops, spewing &quot;graphically vicious remarks about Jews&quot;. Lindemann suggests two reasons for Watson&#x27;s attacks: the feud with Senator Smith, and Watson&#x27;s long-held Populist views about the power of the rich and their ability to escape penalty for things which brought harsh punishment for the poor. In keeping with this view, Watson wrote &quot;Frank belongs to the Jewish aristocracy, and it was determined by the rich Jews that no aristocrat of their race should die for the death of a working-class Gentile.&quot;
In response to the condemnation of Georgia in the national press after the Leo Frank lynching, Watson responded in &quot;The Jeffersonian&quot; intimating that &quot;another Ku Klux Klan may be organized to restore home rule.&quot; However, Watson&#x27;s biographer found no evidence that Watson had any connection to the second KKK that was later formed.

===World War I===
With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Watson was sympathetic to the insurgent Socialist Party of America, and he opposed American entry into the war. By opposing the war, Watson made himself vulnerable to his political opponents, most of whom supported the war. Watson mustered political resistance with headlines asking, &quot;Do You Want Your Son Killed in Europe in A Quarrel You Have Nothing to Do With?&quot;. As a result of his Socialist association, his continued criticism of the war after the American entry in 1917, and his class-based arguments against the Selective Service Act of 1917, the U.S. Post Office refused to deliver his publications, bringing them to an end.

===Election to U.S. Senate and death===
In 1918, Watson made a late bid for Congress but lost to Carl Vinson, who had been a strong supporter of American involvement in World War I. Watson rejoined the Democratic Party, and in 1920 was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating his bitter rival Hoke Smith.

Watson died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1922 at age 66. Rebecca L. Felton was appointed to succeed him and served (for 24 hours) as the first female U.S. Senator.

===Legacy===

Named for Watson is the &quot;Thomas E. Watson Highway&quot;, a portion of U.S. Route 23 in Habersham County, Georgia.

Watson was honored with a bronze statue on the lawn of the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta over the legend &quot;A champion of right who never faltered in the cause.&quot; In October 2013, Governor Nathan Deal signed an order for the relocation of the statue to Park Plaza, which is across the street from the Capitol. He said that the relocation was part of a renovation. On November 29, 2013, Watson&#x27;s statue was removed from the steps of the state Capitol, and relocated across the street at Park Plaza.

<doc id="404809" wikidata="Q2700600" url="?curid=404809" title="Amanattō">
<text>is a Japanese traditional confectionery made of azuki or other beans, covered with refined sugar after simmering with sugar syrup and drying.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shurtleff/Aoyagi&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
It was developed by Hosoda Yasubei during the &quot;Bunkyū&quot; years (1861–1863) in the Edo period. He opened a &quot;wagashi&quot; store in Tokyo, which he named for his childhood name: Eitaro. This store continues to operate.

Amanattō was originally called ; the name was abbreviated to &quot;amanattō&quot; after World War II. The resemblance of the name to the fermented bean dish nattō is coincidental.

In Hokkaidō, amanattō is used in cooking &quot;sekihan&quot;. For this reason, unlike other areas in East Asia, the &quot;sekihan&quot; of Hokkaidō is a little sweet.

<text>Radio Times is a British weekly listings magazine devoted to television and radio programme schedules, with other features such as interviews, film reviews and lifestyle items. Founded in September 1923 by John Reith, then general manager of the British Broadcasting Company, it was the world&#x27;s first broadcast listings magazine. In September 2023 it became the first broadcast listings magazine to reach and then pass its centenary.

It was published entirely in-house by BBC Magazines from 8 January 1937 until 16 August 2011, when the division was merged into Immediate Media Company. On 12 January 2017, Immediate Media was bought by the German media group Hubert Burda.

The magazine is published on Tuesdays and carries listings for the week from Saturday to Friday. Originally, listings ran from Sunday to Saturday: the changeover meant 8 October 1960 was listed twice, in successive issues. Since Christmas 1969, a 14-day double-duration issue has been published each December containing schedules for two weeks of programmes. Originally this covered Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Day, but on some occasions those have each appeared in separate editions due to the two-week period ending just before the New Year.

==History and profile==

&quot;The Radio Times&quot; was first issued on 28 September 1923 for the price of 2d, carrying details of programmes for six BBC wireless stations (2LO, 5IT, 2ZY, 5NO, 5WA and 5SC); newspapers at the time boycotted radio listings fearing that increased listenership might decrease their sales. It included a message to &quot;listeners&quot; by the BBC&#x27;s chairman, Lord Pease. Initially, &quot;The Radio Times&quot; was a combined enterprise between the British Broadcasting Company and publishers George Newnes Ltd within the latter typeset, printed and distributed the magazine. In 1925, the BBC assumed full editorial control, but printing and distribution could not begin in-house until 1937. &quot;The Radio Times&quot; established a reputation for using leading writers and illustrators, and the covers from the special editions are now collectable design classics. By 26 September 1926, the narrow columns of BBC&#x27;s wireless programme schedules were broken up by the insertion of a photograph or two – relevant to or depicting subjects of the broadcasts. On 1 May 1927, &quot;The Radio Times&quot; produced an experimental Braille edition under the auspices of the National Institute for the Blind with its success led to a regular weekly version publication costing one penny. From 15 January 1933, the introduction of a weekly crossword puzzle heralded as popular as ever within the publication making its first-ever appearance.

From 5 January 1934, the three-column programme pages were expanded to include a fourth column with the BBC&#x27;s television programmes given a new section layout (on 8 January), and &quot;The Radio Times&quot; announced a regular series of &quot;experimental television transmissions by the Baird process&quot; for half an hour every night at 11.00pm. The launch of the first regular 405-line television service by the BBC was reflected with television listings in &quot;The Radio Times&quot;″ London edition of 23 October 1936. Thus, &quot;Radio Times&quot; became the first-ever television listings magazine in the world. Initially, only two pages in each edition were devoted to television, which ran from Monday to Saturday and remained off-air on Sundays.
After 14 years, from issue 693 (cover date 8 January 1937), that definitive article word &quot;The&quot; was no longer used on the masthead within the magazine, and the publication became simply known as &quot;Radio Times&quot;; they also published a lavish photogravure supplement in the same issue. Prior to the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, the BBC radio listings provided a National Programme for the whole of the United Kingdom, and the Regional Programme appeared in seven different versions (London, Midlands, North, West, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland) each with a combination of various transmitters respectively before the two stations merged into a single service, and included three pages of television listings.

When Britain&#x27;s declaration of war with Germany on 3 September 1939 and the television broadcasting ceased, while radio listings continued with a reduced service. From 23 June 1944, the Allied Expeditionary Forces edition carried details of all the programmes for the Home Service and General Forces Programme. The same year, paper rationing meant editions were only 20 pages of tiny print on thin paper. &quot;Radio Times&quot; expanded with regional editions introduced from 29 July 1945, and television resumed once again on 7 June 1946. On 4 March 1948, the weekend listing schedules for three BBC radio networks were doubled together with daytime and evening sections in additional four pages a week, as well as weekday billings also used by the same layout which adds 12 extra pages of more articles and detailed programmes bringing up to 40 (or 44 for the television edition) on 1 July 1949.

From 18 January 1953, the television listing schedules, which had been in the back of the magazine, were placed alongside daily radio schedules. On 17 February 1957 (shortly after the abolition of the &quot;Toddlers&#x27; Truce&quot;, in which transmissions terminated between 6.00 and 7.00pm), television listings were moved to a separate section at the front with radio listings relegated to the back; a day&#x27;s listings were sometimes spread over up to three double-page spreads mixed with advertisements, but this format was phased out when independent publishers were allowed to publish television schedules. The new layout was structured thusly:
From 8 October 1960, BBC television and radio schedules were re-integrated; the programmes included a new &quot;pick of the week&quot; with a single third page for previews, before each day&#x27;s listings; these came before the two pages of television and the four pages of radio. A new bolder masthead was designed by Abram Games (who created graphical designs such as the &quot;Festival Star&quot; on the cover of the 1951 Festival of Britain and the 1953 &quot;Bat&#x27;s Wings&quot; ident) and containing the words &quot;BBC TV and Sound&quot; on the left side, was introduced with this revamp; it became one of the shortest-used designs in the magazine&#x27;s history. On 4 August 1962, when &quot;Radio Times&quot; was again revamped, the masthead was replaced with one incorporating the words in the Clarendon typeface; while the main change was the reduction of BBC radio schedules for three stations to a double-page spread brought down into size, the magazine now generally had between 60 and 68 pages, as compared to the relaunched format from two years earlier, which contained only 52 pages.

From 30 September 1967, &quot;Radio Times&quot; introduced the all-new colour pages of the magazine&#x27;s feature sections, including &quot;star stories&quot;, Percy Thrower&#x27;s gardening, Zena Skinner&#x27;s cookery, Bill Hartley&#x27;s motoring and Jeffery Boswall&#x27;s birdwatching, as well as &quot;Round and About&quot; with up-to-the-minute stories in both television and radio from around the world. At the same time, the four new BBC radio stations (replacing the Home Service, the Light Programme and the Third Programme) were launched within the schedule listing pages. The layouts of programme page headings have now restyled as well as the three radio pages had been rearranged with schedule billings for Radio 1 and Radio 2 on the first, Radio 3 on the second and Radio 4 on the third. In future weeks, it would boast another revised masthead although the same typeface simply a bold symbol &quot;BBC TV&quot; to the right of the title – within the price, date and regional edition being overprinted in letterpress at the top of the front page, but the letters section and the crossword were placed inside the back page.

On 6 September 1969, &quot;Radio Times&quot; was given another radical makeover, as they switched the date format from &quot;month-day-year&quot; to &quot;day-month-year&quot; and ceased carrying cigarette advertisements after 46 years. The new format inside with the first three pages were devoted to an abbreviated listing of all the week&#x27;s BBC television and radio programmes in a simple condensed form, within major changes were noticeable on the feature pages as well as the colour ones were spread out to accompany rather than the centre page. The look of the magazine initially became far more restrained, with less white space between columns and headings. More significantly, the lifestyle section (which covered motoring, gardening and cookery) and the crossword were completely dropped, and the highlights section was scrapped. The front cover was surrounded by a black border and italicised its masthead (now in the Caslon typeface with swash capitals; this logo remained until April 2001), in an attempt to emphasize the &quot;R&quot; for radio and &quot;T&quot; for television. From 5 July 1975, the magazine was given a refreshed layout which consisted of horizontal black bars from top to bottom with the familiar darker-shaded look; by this time, the BBC&#x27;s television schedules included a &quot;colour&quot; annotation that was dropped eight years later, as well as programmes in black and white were never indicated with the exception of feature films originally made for the cinema.

Another major change occurred on 18 November 1978, in response to wavelength changes (took place on 23 November) that enabled Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to receive their own separate domestic services in addition to Radio 4 (also known as the national &quot;Radio 4 UK&quot; service remained until 29 September 1984), the arrival of these services on the pages forced all BBC radio stations into a six-column grid. On 30 August 1980, &quot;Radio Times&quot; developed a new double-page spread of Robert Ottaway&#x27;s highlights from the week ahead, often used for both BBC radio and television programmes. The regular inside back page section for younger listeners and viewers featured content from &quot;Newsround&quot; presenter John Craven and a selection of new puzzles created by the television producer Clive Doig, such as the trackword (which consisted of nine squares in one word), as well as backstage stories and a comic strip of Peter Lord&#x27;s &quot;Morph&quot; at the bottom of the page.

Between March and December 1983, &quot;Radio Times&quot; had severe industrial disputes when the British Printing &amp; Communications Corporation and the union SOGAT 82 joined forces, and production was affected due to printing problems:
* 23 March – The BBC regrets that the printers for next week&#x27;s edition are in short supply, but copies will be available in the South West, the West of England, North East, and many parts of South and the North of England.
* 7 April – The BBC expects copies of the magazine will be available in Scotland, Northern Ireland and North of England from 16 April, following the print workers in East Kilbride and near Bristol returning to work.
* 4 June – The general election special issue with the combined England edition, as well as the three constituent nations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) across throughout the country was used for one week only.
* 16 July – The magazine was finally returned to the fully-regionalised form with complete details of all BBC television channels and radio stations for national, regional and local.
* 10 December – The magazine was printed and published as the single national edition once again, due to a print workers&#x27; strike from the previous week.

On 23 June 1984, the radio listings were redesigned again to improve their legibility and paving the way for a new printing technology. That same year (1 September), web-offset printing was used for the first time, meaning the magazine became brighter and more colourful. Newsprint and sheets of gravure gave way to black ink and white paper, Helvetica replaced Franklin Gothic for a larger character style, and the television listings were also redesigned including the new film icon and the &quot;today at a glance&quot; sidebar on the far right of pages were added. Starting from 11 October 1986, the new family viewing policy warned readers that BBC Television does not broadcast programmes before 9.00pm which it believed to be unsuitable for children. On 5 September 1987, &quot;Radio Times&quot; introduces an innovative title called &quot;Upfront This Week&quot; devoting the first three pages of illustrated snippets to provide the latest programme highlights from all BBC television and radio networks. On 19 November 1988, &quot;Radio Times&quot; launched a new weekly back page section called &quot;My Kind of Day&quot;, which was devoted to the latest star interviews with various special guests.

On 25 March 1989 (during Easter), a general overhaul of page layout and design took place, with a major makeover for the programme schedules and the channel headings being visible in greater clarity; BBC1 and BBC2 were once again separated, with the return of the late 1950s/early 1960s layout – television at the front and radio at the back. The week&#x27;s Radio 1 schedules occupied a single page, followed by Radio 2 (with a facing pair of pages), then several pages of Radio 3 (five pages) and Radio 4 (six pages), and finally the BBC Local Radio listings; regional features, which had absent from the English editions since the late 1960s, resumed with a localised page. Later on 25 November of that year, the radio schedules were restored to two pages for each day; some of the English editions now had daily editorial features on radio as well.

From 2 June 1990, the entire magazine was published in colour for the first time, and another layout began usage; the day&#x27;s listings began with a single page of highlights that included &quot;at a glance&quot;, followed by the double-page spreads of BBC television channels (BBC1 always occupied the left page and BBC2 for the right page, without advertisements interrupting the listings) and BBC radio stations, now enlivened with colour logos at the top of the pages. This layout only lasted for six months, when a new refreshed format debuted in the Christmas edition (22 December); while the programme listing pages were largely the same, the colour-coded days of the week were now at the top of the page headings.

On 16 February 1991 (the same date for the debut of the new BBC1 and BBC2 idents), the deregulation of television listings began, and &quot;Radio Times&quot; started to cover all services that include ITV, Channel 4 and satellite networks, an alphabetical list of the commercial radio stations available with the frequency and a two or three-word summary of that station&#x27;s output which was added to the local radio page. Full complete listings of the four main channels and satellite began on Friday 1 March.

Prior to deregulation, the five weekly listings magazines were as follows:
* &quot;Radio Times&quot; carried the programme schedule listings for BBC radio and television channels, including the new Radio 5 launched on 27 August 1990.
* The ITV-published magazine &quot;TV Times&quot;, launched on 22 September 1955, carried programme listings for ITV, and Channel 4 from 2 November 1982. The regional ITV companies produced their own listings magazines – &quot;Look Westward&quot; (WTV), &quot;The Viewer&quot; (Tyne Tees), &quot;TV Guide&quot; (STV), &quot;TV Post&quot; (Ulster), &quot;Television Weekly&quot; (TWW/ITSWW/Harlech), &quot;Wales TV&quot;/&quot;Teledu Cymru&quot; (WWN) and &quot;TV World&quot; (ATV/ABC) – were published before &quot;TV Times&quot; went national on 21 September 1968.
* &quot;Sbec&quot;, a pull-out weekly listings supplement (first published on 1 November 1982) which is distributed free with the Wales edition of &quot;TV Times&quot;, containing the full details of S4C&#x27;s schedules in both Welsh and English, as well as Channel 4&#x27;s programmes were also included.
* Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s new publication &quot;TV Guide&quot; launches on 19 March 1989, carried the 28 pages of Astra satellite (1A) television listings for various Sky channels (including Sky One, Sky News, Sky Movies, Eurosport, and from 15 December 1990, Sky Arts, Movie Channel, Power Station and Sports Channel were added after the BSB merger on the Marcopolo system), MTV, RTL Véronique (for English programmes), Screensport, Children&#x27;s Channel, Lifestyle with a highlights of BBC, ITV and Channel 4 listings.
* In the Republic of Ireland, Raidió Teilifís Éireann published the &quot;RTÉ Guide&quot; (formerly the &quot;RTV Guide&quot;) launched on 1 December 1961, it offered detailed programme listings for RTÉ&#x27;s television and radio channels. From 8 January 1977, they switched from tabloid format to a compact A4-sized magazine and also changes from monochrome into colour, while listings were carried for Radio Luxembourg, AFN and BBC Northern Ireland were later dropped on 8 July 1966, but only the RTÉ programme schedules up until 13 April 1991.
Today, both publications carry listings for all major terrestrial, cable and satellite television channels in the United Kingdom and following deregulation, new listings magazines such as Mirror Group&#x27;s &quot;TV First&quot;, IPC Media&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s on TV&quot;, Bauer Media Group&#x27;s &quot;TV Quick&quot; and Hamfield Publications&#x27; &quot;TV Plus&quot; began to be published; several newspapers were also allowed to print television schedules for the entire forthcoming week on a Saturday (or a Sunday), where previously they had only been able to list each day&#x27;s programmes in that edition.

With another major refresh on 31 August 1991, the four extra pages of satellite television listings and one page of the highlights section were scrapped and replaced by a number of ten satellite networks (with two more includes Comedy Channel and CNN International were added) from top to bottom; the daytime schedules for BBC1 and BBC2 flanked the satellite listings on the left, with ITV, Channel 4 and &quot;at a glance&quot; on the right; the main evening schedules for terrestrial television channels retained the same layout. On 5 September 1992, the daytime listings were slightly tweaked, ITV&#x27;s programme schedules were now sandwiched between BBC2 and Channel 4 within the centre pages, and there were now two pages of satellite and cable channels for each category making up six pages of television listings every day:
During 1993, &quot;Radio Times&quot; used several layouts were altered throughout the year:
* 1 January – The VideoPlus+ number codes to cover all the terrestrial and satellite television channels were added for the first time, which allowed viewers with suitably equipped video recorders to entering the programme&#x27;s number would ensure to set its timer from taping it.
* 2 January – The new &quot;film premiere&quot; icon appears for terrestrial television listings, replacing the phrase &quot;first showing on network television&quot;.
* 30 April – The second national commercial station Virgin 1215 is launched and appears in the local radio listings page.
* 5 June – The radio schedules are given a radical makeover, with highlights on the right includes day-by-day Virgin 1215, Classic FM and BBC World Service added to each page; the local radio listings now incorporated the weekly frequency guide, and the television schedule pages saw the introduction of the year of production shown in brackets for film titles.
* 19 June – The categories for satellite television listings were completely rearranged, with the news section includes Sky One moving to the left and the sport section moving to the right, also adding BSkyB&#x27;s film classifications at the bottom corner on the left page.
* 24 July – Two former cable-only services (Bravo and Discovery) appeared in the entertainment section following their launch on satellite, and the cable television listings were relegated to the bottom, meaning the sport section was no longer used.
* 1 September – With the introduction of Sky Multichannels package on the new Astra 1C system, three new services (UK Living, Family Channel and Nickelodeon) launched as well as CMT Europe; all were added to the previously unused entertainment category within the sport section (sandwiched between movies and news on the left) is returned and Sky One&#x27;s schedules has moved back to the right page.
* 11 September – The satellite television listings is given a redesigned layout, starting with the new movie planner section (providing the latest film titles in alphabetical order on various channels at different times every day); other changes included the new factual section (including Discovery, Sky News and CNN International) that replaced the news category, and the sport section moves back to the right page once again.
* 18 September – The British versions of TNT and Cartoon Network were added to the movie planner and entertainment sections respectively.
* 25 September – The daytime listings were changed again, with &quot;at a glance&quot; now on the right page and advertisements occupying the left page. The channel heading logos were reduced into smaller horizontal bars on columns adjacent to those used for terrestrial television listings, a new children&#x27;s television section (with Children&#x27;s Channel, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network) was added, and the cable listings including Super Channel were moved to the left side next to the movie planner section (with Asia Vision, Wire TV and Learning Channel being removed).
* 1 October – The British version of QVC launches, appearing at the bottom corner in the entertainment section.
* 26 December – The final Christmas Sunday listings used both on television and radio for the very last time, this practice has now fallen out of common usage believed to result from the legalisation of Sunday trading in England and Wales for the following year.

&quot;Radio Times&quot;″ design was refreshed on 3 September 1994, the television listings now had the day&#x27;s name written vertically, beginning with the daytime section including &quot;today&#x27;s choices&quot; (which replaced &quot;at a glance&quot; on the left page), followed by the main evening&#x27;s schedules in an original four-column grid, as well as the highlights section (now occupying the far left page within the satellite listings), and the movie planner is now on the right page. On 22 March 1997, the programme pages in the television section were restyled often include smaller headings and more billing type with several changes in this layout between the narrower columns for Channel 5 schedules (which launches on 30 March) on the right and regional variations on the left page. Yet another major revamp took place on 25 September 1999, where all the pages now proceeded in a particular order, starting with the letters section, followed by film reviews, then the seven-day programme guide with six pages for television (including satellite) and two pages for radio, as well as the single-page crossword and local radio listings with frequencies, and finally the &quot;My Kind of Day&quot; for the back page which was preceded by classified advertisements. The programme page headings were returned to being inside a coloured block, and the primetime television listings went from two narrow columns to one wide column. The warning phrase &quot;contains strong language&quot;, used for BBC television programmes from 9.00pm during the hours of watershed broadcasting restrictions was also implemented at this time, lasting until 2009. This layout lasted until shortly before Easter on 13 April 2001, which saw the new masthead title with the BBC&#x27;s corporate typeface Gill Sans (used until the end of 2004, being replaced by Interstate in the start of 2005), while the programme pages with eight pages of television listings reverted to having the day running across the top of the page horizontally, and the satellite listings expanded into four pages, while the double-page movie planner section for 18 different film channels was retained.

From 30 October 2004, the programme schedule pages were revamped again, with the regional variations now at the bottom of the daytime section, as well as the same spread on the five main channels; BBC3, BBC4, ITV2, ITV3 (launched on 1 November) and More4 (from 10 October 2005) now appeared in digital/cable section on the right page, with a children&#x27;s section in a single page on the left. The category sections for digital, satellite and cable listings also returned after a four-year absence:
On 22 May 2007, two extra pages of television listings per day were added as part of a slight tweak in the publication&#x27;s format, bringing it up to ten pages of listings per day in total, or five double-page spreads: one page of highlights with daytime listings and regional variations, followed by two pages of evening&#x27;s terrestrial television listings (with &quot;at a glance&quot; for nine digital channels until 2010), then six pages of listings for digital, satellite and cable channels. Digital radio listings were integrated into the main radio pages, and three new pages of sport, lifestyle and music were added. By 11 April 2009, the digital, satellite and cable schedules were reshuffled (alongside entertainment, factual and children&#x27;s sections) preceded by &quot;today&#x27;s choices&quot; on the left side, and the sport section moves to the right side as well as the films section having also started on the left within the centre pages horizontally.

10 April 2010 saw major changes as &quot;Radio Times&quot; went through an overhaul, with two pages of the latest reviews and highlights (&quot;choices&quot;) somewhat akin to the &quot;TV Times&quot;, while the daytime listings moved onto the evening section having the full day&#x27;s output for the five main channels on one double-page spread, other changes saw listings start at 5.00pm rather than 6.30pm (sometimes earlier than 5.00pm for weekends, bank holidays, Easter, Christmas and New Year), the addition of electronic program guide numbers into the channel headers, and the inclusion of director and year of production details for films throughout the day. For the London 2012 Olympics, the listings for three terrestrial channels (BBC2, ITV and Channel 4) temporarily moved onto the right page and Channel 5 was moved to the next page on the left, as to provide enough space for BBC1 and BBC3/BBC4 as the Olympic broadcasters, which also reminded viewers of using both the red button and online for BBC channels with additional broadcasts.

Following the closure of the BBC3 channel on 20 February 2016, &quot;Radio Times&quot; started to include BBC4 in the main channels section, with Channel 5 being relegated to the Freeview section. On 24 March 2020, to coincide with the launch of Disney+, &quot;Radio Times&quot; introduced two new sections for podcasts and six pages devoted to streaming and various catch-up services. That same year (8 September), the rearrangement of Freeview channel listings with Sky Arts moves to the second page, also the three columns in the satellite and cable pages now have on the left side with children&#x27;s television section, as well as the six film services were also included. During the Tokyo Olympics (which was delayed due to global COVID-19 pandemic) on 20 July 2021, &quot;Radio Times&quot; declared its special bumper issue with 212 pages that include 16-day listings of the BBC&#x27;s coverage and a comprehensive easy-to-use guide preceded by two pages with &quot;pick of the action&quot; chosen by various pundits, although this layout becoming slightly different whether listings started on the left page with two columns for BBC1 as a dedicated Olympic broadcaster (including BBC Red Button occupies at the bottom) and BBC2 in the single column, as well as ITV, Channel 4 and BBC4 schedules placed on the right page. From 25 January 2022, the Freeview schedules have altered once again starting with the return of BBC3 (launches on 1 February after six years since the television channel has moved online), whether ITV2&#x27;s listings now occupies at the bottom, as well as the seven remaining services were also placed in the second and third pages respectively.

From 4 October 2022 (three weeks before the BBC&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebrations), &quot;Radio Times&quot; refreshed its format:
* The &quot;this week&quot; section which was devoted to the best entertainment reviews with all latest news over the next seven days, as well as other features including the grapevine, ten questions, viewpoint and &quot;on the box&quot; as fronted by broadcaster Jane Garvey.
* The expanded pages of the streaming section provides the best of catch-up services for television and films (include free-to-view, subscription or premium) so you want to watch every day.
* The double-page &quot;highlights&quot; section has given a newly refreshed layout dedicated to the most comprehensive guide of programmes throughout the week ahead with &quot;also on today&quot;, &quot;live sport&quot; and &quot;film of the day&quot; also included.
* The third page of the Freeview section includes some of its children&#x27;s television schedules sandwiched between the top two channels. Food Network and Blaze were added as requested by readers and the number of movie channels was reduced from 18 to eight within the centre pages, with the latest film reviews which also embedded into each day&#x27;s listings occupied by the right hand side.
* The last two pages of satellite/cable schedules followed by the sport section was incorporated into a &quot;quick and easy&quot; planner with various times by using individual live coverage of other events, as well as channel numbers (include Sky Sports, BT Sport, Eurosport and Premier Sports) were listed in the bottom right corner. Three weeks later (18 October), the mainstream sport listings were reverted to any channel rather than popular events.

On 4 April 2023, the radio pages had a major refresh to provide listings by adding three services (Boom Radio, Greatest Hits Radio, and Times Radio), as well as a restyled podcasts section to improve pick of the best audio on demand.

===NTL special edition===
On 26 November 2002, NTL and BBC Worldwide announced a major new agreement that would offer an exclusive, tailored edition of &quot;Radio Times&quot; to every NTL customer across the United Kingdom every week, to be delivered directly to subscribers&#x27; homes. The special NTL edition of &quot;Radio Times&quot; replaced the monthly &quot;Cable Guide&quot; magazine, which had been published from September 1986 to December 2002. It contained programme information for channels carried by NTL, including all terrestrial services. Front Row&#x27;s pay-per-view movies and events were also included. Subscribers were offered the first four weekly issues of the new title for the same price as the existing monthly magazine, delivered free to homes in time for the first programme week of 4 January 2003; both companies actively and jointly marketed the new edition.

===Circulation===
In 1934, &quot;Radio Times&quot; achieved a circulation of two million and its net profit in that year was more than one quarter of the total BBC licence income. By the 1950s, &quot;Radio Times&quot; had grown to be the magazine with the largest circulation in Europe, with an average sale of 8.8 million in 1955. Following the 1969 relaunch, circulation indeed dropped by about a quarter of a million, it would take several years to recover but the magazine remained ahead of glossier lifestyle-led competitor, &quot;TV Times&quot;. In the mid-1970s, it was just over four million; but in 2013 it was just over one million.

Between January and June 1990, &quot;Radio Times&quot; had its audited circulation of 2.8 million and &quot;TV Times&quot; of 2.7 million within a year before the deregulation of television listings as they both had exclusivity of the future BBC and other commercial broadcasters respectively.

During a major revamp in April 2010, &quot;Radio Times&quot; was the third-biggest-selling magazine in the United Kingdom. However, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the magazine experienced about 2.2% year-on-year decrease to an average weekly sale of 1,648,000 in the second half of 2009. It averaged a circulation per issue of 497,852 between July and December 2020, versus 1,041,826 for &quot;TV Choice&quot; and 690,617 for &quot;What&#x27;s on TV&quot;.

===Advertising===
Between April and November 1990, &quot;Radio Times&quot; included a four-page advertising feature featuring previews of British Satellite Broadcasting programmes for its five channels - Sports Channel, Movie Channel, Now, Galaxy and 
Power Station.

During the deregulation of television listings, there was strong criticism from other magazines that &quot;Radio Times&quot; was advertised on the BBC (as well as on commercial broadcasting channels), saying that it gave unfair advantage to a publication and includes the tagline: &quot;If it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s in&quot;. The case went to court, but the outcome was that, as the &quot;Radio Times&quot; had close connections with the BBC, it would be allowed to be advertised by the BBC; however, from 1992 until 2004, it had to depict a static picture of the cover, and show a clear disclaimer reading &quot;Other television listings magazines are available&quot;, leading to the phrase entering common public usage for a time. By the early 2000s, advertisements for the publication had become sparse on the BBC. &quot;Radio Times&quot; has not been promoted on BBC television and radio channels since 2005, following complaints by rival publications that the promotions were unfair competition.

===Disputes===
For various reasons, &quot;Radio Times&quot; had suffered printing disputes and other operational difficulties have also led to the magazine appearing in a different formats to the standard, as well as some issues were not printed. These include:
===Annuals and guides===
An annual was published three times: in 1954, 1955 and 1956.

The &quot;Radio Times Film &amp; Video Guide&quot; by the magazine&#x27;s film and video editor Derek Winnert was first published in 1994, featuring more than 18,000 films and an introduction by Barry Norman, former presenter of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Film&quot; programme. A second edition was published the following year. In 2000, a completely new &quot;Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; was published by BBC Worldwide, edited by Kilmey Fane-Saunders, featuring more than 21,000 film titles. The last edition of &quot;Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; was published in 2018. In September 2023, &quot;Radio Times&quot; publishes its own 180-page film guide dedicated to reviews and trivia over 1,000 titles with five different star rating systems which include 250 favourites from the beginning of cinema in 1902 to the present day.

There are also similar publications, the &quot;Radio Times Guide to TV Comedy&quot; by Mark Lewisohn and the &quot;Radio Times Guide to Science-Fiction&quot;.

==Covers==
When the magazine was a BBC publication, the covers had a BBC bias (in 2005, 31 of the 51 issues had BBC-related covers) and consisting of a single side of glossy paper, however the magazine often uses double or triple-width covers that open out for several large group photographs.

While the major events (such as Remembrance Day, Crufts, the Oscars/BAFTAs, Eurovision Song Contest, Wimbledon Championships, Glastonbury Festival and the Proms) or new series programmes are marked by producing different covers were actually used for other collectors:
* The first person of colour to feature on the front cover was the American singer Paul Robeson, in the 535th issue which dated on 29 December 1933.
* Following the invasion of Poland and Britain&#x27;s declaration of war with Germany, &quot;Radio Times&quot; published its supplementary edition on 4 September 1939 (issue number 831A) which depicts this cover showing the BBC&#x27;s headquarters that include the Union Jack flag within the words &quot;Broadcasting carries on&quot; underneath.
* &quot;Radio Times&quot; declared its special &#x27;Coronation Number&#x27; issue on 31 May 1953 with a record-breaking 9,012,358 copies sold, as well as Eric Fraser&#x27;s heraldic cover illustration and also made the back page depicted his lion and the unicorn tucking into an advertisement for Bachelors tinned foods. It was the first artwork cover since before World War II by the presses at Waterlow and Sons couldn&#x27;t print in full colour but the existing technology allowed a yellowish gold tint between the back and front within a red crown motif running across the magazine. Fraser was the revered illustrator who had worked for the publication between 1926 and 1982, until his death on 15 November 1983 at the age of 81. A similar version to this majestic artwork cover designed by Peter Horridge on 2 May 2023, preparing for the next coronation after more than 70 years which include its updated official emblem of the royal cypher within a year in Roman numerals underneath.
* &quot;Radio Times&quot; celebrated the upcoming Apollo 11 Moon landing on 10 July 1969, with this cover bearing the &quot;TARGET MOON&quot; caption at the top of the Saturn V rocket lifts off from Kennedy Space Center as part of the NASA&#x27;s Apollo mission.
* During BBC Television&#x27;s 50th anniversary on 1 November 1986, Tony McSweeney&#x27;s cover illustration depicted a 1930s family living in the shadow of Alexandra Palace somehow watching the opening titles of &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on a modern colour set.
* 23 February 1991 saw &quot;Radio Times&quot; began offering a comprehensive programme schedule guide to BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and various satellite networks (from Friday 1 March) bearing the &quot;If it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s in&quot; tagline, which includes Arnold Schwarzenegger on the cover focusing about the Austrian bodybuilding champion and successfully become the biggest film career in Hollywood. There was also a mixed reaction for the deregulation of television listings had occurred and allow information on all channels to be printed as they showing material by the broadcasters with its other competitors.
* On 26 March 1994, to coincide the relaunch of Radio 5 as &#x27;Five Live&#x27; (the new rolling news and sport service which took place on 28 March) within the group consisted of Nelson Mandela, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, John Major and Benazir Bhutto to appear on the cover wearing in t-shirts that includes the logo was done by Sven Arnstein, as well as Jones Bloom&#x27;s electronic retouching but we also told that the sportswear came from Lillywhites and the footwear from John Lewis.
* A special issue for the 50th anniversary of BBC television news on 3 July 2004, as well as a fold-out cover with BBC news teams (from left to right: Huw Edwards, Fiona Bruce, Anna Ford, George Alagiah, Sophie Raworth, Dermot Murnaghan, Natasha Kaplinsky, Sian Williams, Darren Jordon and Moira Stuart) was photographed by Andy Earl, and also an accompanying special pull-out supplement within the centre pages.
* On 10 February 2007, the second series of &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, was marked by the &quot;Radio Times&quot; producing a mock-up of a 1973-style cover promoting the series, placed on page three of the magazine.
* &quot;Radio Times&quot; reaches its 5,000th edition on 9 May 2020 with lead articles from the support staff and workers of the National Health Service front line during the COVID-19 pandemic known as the coronavirus disease, and also granted this cover showing the colours of the rainbow which uses acrylic paint in a plain white background.
* &quot;Radio Times&quot; commemorated its centenary with its issue covering programmes between 23-29 September 2023. Four variant covers were produced: all shared the same &quot;gold&quot; graphic marking &quot;100 Years&quot; but featured four of the publication&#x27;s most famous mastheads. 

Each year, &quot;Radio Times&quot; celebrates those individuals and programmes that are featured at the Covers Party, where framed oversized versions of the covers are presented. &quot;Radio Times&quot; had several sporting events with more than one of the Home Nations (such as the Six Nations, UEFA European Championship, Commonwealth Games and the Rugby World Cup) taking part are often marked with different covers for each nation, showing their own team.

To mark the 90th anniversary of its publication, the Museum of London hosted an exhibition lasting several months in 2013, which showed various covers as part of the magazine&#x27;s history.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; is the most represented programme on the cover, appearing on 29 issues (with 35 separate covers due to multiples) in the 49 years since the programme began on 23 November 1963.
On 30 April 2005, a double-width cover was used to commemorate the return of the Daleks to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the forthcoming general election. This cover recreated a scene from the 1964 serial &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; in which the Daleks were seen crossing Westminster Bridge with the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben in the background, and also the cover text read &quot;VOTE DALEK!&quot;. On 29 September 2008, in a contest sponsored by the Periodical Publishers Association, this cover was voted the best British magazine cover of all time. Five years later (on 17 April 2010) before the next general election, three special covers depicting the Daleks invading the capital once more within showing their colours of red, blue and yellow as one of several Britain&#x27;s political parties for Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats were used individually.

Throughout the decades, &quot;Radio Times&quot; had covers for various television specials and anniversary editions:
* On 19 November 1983, the show celebrated its 20th anniversary with a standalone special featuring Tom Baker, Patrick Troughton, Peter Davison, Jon Pertwee, Richard Hurndall (who replaced William Hartnell, who died on 23 April 1975) and Anthony Ainley as The Master. They featured in an illustrated cover by Andrew Skilleter.
* On 20 November 1993, as the show marked its 30th anniversary, the surviving actors who had played The Doctor appeared to promote the special television event, a crossover between &quot;EastEnders&quot; as part of the BBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon. 3D glasses were sold in aid of the charity enhanced viewing of several programmes broadcast throughout the week, and the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode to be aired since the series ended on 6 December 1989.
* &quot;Doctor Who&quot; returned to television on 25 May 1996 after a seven-year absence, as Paul McGann starred in a feature-length television special with a corresponding cover, and a 16-page pull-out supplement.
* A themed night on BBC2 on 13 November 1999, was marked by a specially commissioned Dalek portrait photographed by Lord Snowdon, which was originally used as a stamp design.
* For its 40th anniversary on 22 November 2003, a commemorative cover was photographed by Andy Earl to create a panoramic vista featuring Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Tom Baker and Peter Davison, as well as the TARDIS, K-9, a Cyberman and the two Daleks.
* The 23 November 2013 issue marked the 50th anniversary of the programme with a selection of 12 different covers.

===Christmas===

The cover of the &#x27;Christmas Number&#x27; (as this issue came to be called) dating from the time when it contained just a single week&#x27;s listings, usually features a generic festive artwork, atypical for the magazine, which since the 1970s has almost exclusively used photographic covers. In recent years, &quot;Radio Times&quot; has published and sold packs of reproductions of some of these covers of the magazine as Christmas cards.

The 1988 Christmas double issue (dated 17–30 December) had a panto-themed cover illustration by Lynda Gray, with its popularity climaxed when the publication sold an astounding 11,220,666 copies, and the Guinness Book of Records certified it as the biggest-selling edition of any British magazine in history.

===Royal specials===
Over the past years, &quot;Radio Times&quot; published special majestic covers (often marked as a &#x27;souvenir&#x27; issue) dedicated to royalty which reflects the monarchy of the United Kingdom, as well as other significant events include birthdays, coronations, jubilees, royal weddings, state funerals and various celebrations across the decades.

Between February 1952 and September 2022, &quot;Radio Times&quot; focuses about Queen Elizabeth II was the nation&#x27;s longest-serving monarch which represented over eight decades during its 70-year reign:
* The informal picture of Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth II was taken by photographer Joan Williams for the cover in this issue on 21 June 1969, during the making of Richard Cawston&#x27;s 110-minute documentary film &quot;Royal Family&quot; which is watched over 30.6 million television viewers almost half the population that includes an estimated global audience of 350 million people. Despite having been repeated ten times in eight years until it was withdrawn from circulation on 11 August 1977, and broadcasters were asked by Buckingham Palace not to be shown again in its entirety. On 28 January 2021, a leaked version of the film and publishes online shortly before taken down due to a copyright claim after the BBC sought to have being removed, it was remained available to view on the video-sharing platform YouTube and the digital library website Internet Archive.
* To celebrate Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee on 28 May 1977, &quot;Radio Times&quot; joined forces with BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in running a competition for children to design a special cover which it led to a staggering 65,000 entrants include Nicola Griffin was the youngest-ever artist talks to &quot;Newsround&quot; presenter John Craven reported her painting of a jolly guardsman, as well as John Noakes going behind the scenes at the printers to watch the first of its three-and-a-half million copies come off the presses.

==Regional editions==
From the first edition of 2023, the regional editions in England were merged into a single edition which includes the times and titles of all of the BBC&#x27;s local radio stations with any non-news variations of adjoining areas for television and radio contained in the listings. Local channel London Live is also featured in the Freeview section, with a note stating that it is a regional network. The stations carried were as follows:
The number of regional editions has been altered over the years within gradually being reduced over time due to there being fewer variations in the programme schedules:
* The North of England region was separated from Northern Ireland on 4 January 1948 who had their own edition.
* The spread of television editions when full listings (with six pages) were not included in all issues between 7 June 1946 and 15 August 1952.
* On 8 October 1960, the Midlands region was renamed &#x27;Midlands &amp; East Anglia&#x27;, and the West of England region was also renamed &#x27;South &amp; West&#x27;.
* On 9 February 1964, the launch of BBC Cymru Wales television service in the Welsh edition of &quot;Radio Times&quot; with its own programme schedule pages from the prominent heading (remained until 1982), without detracting from the service they provided to English viewers on the other side of the Severn Estuary.
* As from 21 March 1964, the previously unmarked London region was successfully renamed &#x27;London &amp; South East&#x27;. It was later dropped on 25 March 1989 when the &#x27;London&#x27; name is no longer used, became known as &#x27;South East&#x27;, and later reverted to its original name on 23 February 1991.
* On 29 August 1970, the four English regional editions (along the constituent nations) were separated into ten areas, such as the administrative counties of Cumberland and Westmorland (which included the Furness exclave in Lancashire and the district of Sedburgh in the West Riding of Yorkshire) before the creation of a new non-metropolitan county of Cumbria from 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 in England and Wales.
* Between 1 November 1982 and 22 February 1991, S4C listings were included in the Wales edition known as &#x27;Rhaglenni Cymraeg&#x27; (Welsh programmes), while its English language programming were simply billed as &#x27;Rhaglenni Saesneg&#x27; with no further detail being given. &quot;TV Times&quot; included a pull-out supplement &quot;Sbec&quot; which gave full details on all S4C programming in both languages. From the following week, it also took the billing space by cutting down on the detail in the Channel 4&#x27;s listings in that edition, and allowing S4C to share some of its space.
* After the deregulation of television listings on 1 March 1991, they rebranded the Northern Ireland edition as &#x27;Ulster&#x27; (named after the historic province), and started including listings for the Irish state broadcaster&#x27;s two channels – RTÉ1 and Network 2 – were occupied the lower half of the three columns devoted to UTV&#x27;s schedules.
* &quot;Radio Times&quot; used to have three separate editions for STV, Grampian and Border (also appearing in the North East edition) while just then after a while they merged back into one Scotland edition from 6 July 1991.
* The exception to this process of merging is Wales on 31 August 1991, which used to be part of a larger &#x27;Wales/West&#x27; (of England), mirroring the HTV area. The region was separated on 16 April 2005 leaving the West of England to join South and South West edition. The two regional editions of London and East Anglia were merged on the same date.
* No publication of &quot;Radio Times&quot; in the Channel Islands as their listing schedules were contained within the South West region when it first appeared in the South edition on 30 March 1991. Channel TV published its own listings magazine, the &quot;CTV Times&quot; (formerly &quot;Channel Viewer&quot;) until 25 October of that year.
* All of four VHF opt-out services from Radio Scotland were ceased broadcasting on 29 January 1993 and the output replaced by local news bulletins throughout each day on 1 February of that year.
* The Yorkshire region was absorbed by the North East region on 25 September 1993 became known as &#x27;Yorkshire/Tyne Tees&#x27;, and also later added the North West region on 7 April 2007.
* On 5 November 2001, BBC 2W launches as the digital-only service in Wales used for weekday evenings from 8.30pm to 10.00pm, within BBC2&#x27;s listings in the normal column is mainly split vertically in two to cover both the analogue and digital services. The digital-only service was ceased on 2 January 2009 as part of the digital switchover, and reverts to the normal service with less frequent regional programmes as the arrangement on analogue broadcasts.
* On 25 August 2007, the Midlands and London/Anglia regions were merged.
* On 24 February 2019, &quot;Radio Times&quot; introduces the BBC Scotland television channel, a new autonomous service that broadcasts an nightly line-up of entirely Scottish-related programming from 7.00pm to midnight replacing the Scotland&#x27;s version of BBC2 after 53 years, and the listings were occupied by BBC4 at the bottom on the right page.

===Radio===
Since its began on 28 September 1923 (during the interwar period), there was just a single national edition to cover all the BBC wireless services including relay stations from 1924:
From 10 October 1926, the two separate regions – &#x27;Northern&#x27; and &#x27;Southern&#x27; – were published before &quot;Radio Times&quot; reverted to one edition and covering all the local stations once again on 7 January 1934:
Between 1930 and 1935, many of the original 21 BBC local stations eventually reduced to six regional services (including Wales from 1937) as well as five national variations with the exceptions of Plymouth, Bournemouth, Aberdeen and Stagshaw were remained until 1939 before the outbreak of World War II:
After the end of World War II in Europe, the seven local variations were resumed on 29 July 1945 which also used by BBC Home Service as they referred similar to its pre-war Regional Programme during the 1930s.

November 1967 saw the introduction of BBC Local Radio whether these regional areas subdivided with individual editions for each English county (except Isle of Man), as well as the national regions and several opt-out services were also used. This continued between February 1981 and January 1983 until each regional edition began to cover three local stations which was previously used by regional news and opt-out programming on Radio 4, apart from the South West (including the Channel Islands) as this is now the only part of England still without any BBC local station. During the mid-1980s and early 1990s, a number of 13 new BBC local stations were added to covering the whole areas throughout the United Kingdom:
===Television===
In November 1936, &quot;Radio Times&quot; launches its first television service in the London area only before they closed down on 1 September 1939 by the duration of war for over six years and finally resumed on 7 June 1946. When the second channel began in 1964, there were a number of areas where only certain parts of a region could get receive this service until 1966:
From 1 March 1991, &quot;Radio Times&quot; started carrying ITV and Channel 4 listings to begin they cover the 14 regional editions (which later reduced to ten areas) include several local television stations used individually as well as the neighbouring countries outside Great Britain where available:
Between April 2005 and August 2007, the regional editions were reduced from ten to six during a number of several television networks have been diminished even further than before as they now covers every local station in this area consisting of 15 BBC regional services and 13 ITV companies were also used:
From 7 January 2023, regional editions in England ended. This saw every BBC Local Radio station included, along with London&#x27;s local television channel London Live, which had always been included in the &#x27;London/Anglia/Midlands&#x27; edition with &quot;Radio Times&quot; stating that it is a regional network and that other local services air on Freeview channels 7 and 8 in other parts of the country.

They identified around five million programmes, involving 8.5 million actors, presenters, writers and technical staff.

The results were made public on 15 October 2014, Corrections to OCR errors and changes to advertised schedules are being crowdsourced. Digitised editions of entire magazines (including front covers, prose articles, advertisements and other non-listings content) were added:

* 1920s 
* 1930s 
* 1940s 
* 1950s

<text>Wartenberg is a municipality in the Vogelsbergkreis in Hesse, Germany.

==Geography==

===Location===
The community lies in the eastern Vogelsberg Mountains. Through the community flows the river Lauter, which empties into the Altefeld in Bad Salzschlirf, itself a tributary to the Schlitz.

===Neighbouring communities===
Wartenberg borders in the north on the town of Schlitz, in the east on the communities of Bad Salzschlirf and Großenlüder (both in Fulda district), in the south on the town of Herbstein, and in the west on the town of Lauterbach.

===Constituent communities===
The community consists of the centres of Angersbach (2,738 inhabitants) and Landenhausen (1,406 inhabitants).

==History==
Wartenberg came into being as part of municipal reforms in 1972, when the two aforesaid places were merged into a new municipality.

===Angersbach===
Angersbach had its first documentary mention in 812. On 20 September of that year, a church in Schlitz was consecrated in Angersbach by the Archbishop of Mainz and the Abbot Baugulf from Fulda.

===Landenhausen===
The form of the village&#x27;s name holds a clue as to the date of its founding, as it was customary in the time from about 700 to about 800 to name a place after its founder. The name means &quot;Lando&#x27;s houses or settlement&quot;. It seems likely, therefore, that the founder&#x27;s name must have been &quot;Lando&quot;, and that Landenhausen was founded about the 8th century.

The first settlers had a chief, whose job it was to defend the settler generation from danger. It therefore stands to reason that a castle or fortified building must have stood near the village. In the meadowlands below the village, called &quot;Im Burggipfel&quot; or &quot;Am Burggipfel&quot;, sandstone foundations may be found, still stuck in the ground. Local inhabitants reported having dug these up in the countryside, and gave accounts of having seen foundations. Some digging unearthed sandstone walls, about 40 cm thick, and it was realized that they once had enclosed a yard of about 40 m2. Furthermore, some sandstone slabs were identified, which had once marked a forecourt, as was a gateway arch, near which were found horseshoes and horses&#x27; bones. The entrance to the castle must have faced towards the village. The Riedesel Archive yields the information that the ruins, still recognizable in the 18th century as a Schultheiß&#x27;s &quot;dilapidated stately home&quot;, were cleared away. It seems likely that it was a castle with a moat, the more so as the surrounding area of meadowland is still crossed by several streams, and as some places are boggy moorland. However, documentary evidence for this castle is very scanty.

====Lords of Landenhausen and of Angersbach====
The first mention of the noble family of Angersbach goes back to the year 812 when Baron Friedrich von Angersbach donated commodities to the monastery of Fulda. A document from the year 1114 yields the names Heinrich von Landenhausen and Herold von Landenhausen, the latter being the former&#x27;s son. In the 12th century there was therefore still a noble family called von Landenhausen. Moreover, the same document&#x27;s naming of Friedrich von Angersbach strongly suggests that the Lords of Landenhausen and of Angersbach were quite close. Given the lack of any further documentary evidence that could shed light on the von Landenhausens&#x27; lives, it is assumed that, either through marriage or inheritance, they were merged into the von Angersbachs.

Also to be found in Fulda monastic documents, dated 1114, is a donation by both lordly houses to the Monastery of Fulda. The document mentions both families in connection with this donation. To quote therefrom, it says: &quot;a certain faithful person by the name of Heinrich von Landenhausen&quot;, or in the original Latin, &quot;&quot;quidam fidelis homo nomine Heinricus de Lantenhusen&quot;.&quot; The use of the word &quot;homo&quot; here is a key point, as this was used in these documents generally only for people of high standing or nobility. It is assumed that Heinrich von Landenhausen was descended from the first nobleman in the line, Lando, who is said to be Landenhausen&#x27;s founder and namesake. It is furthermore assumed that the von Landenhausens&#x27; seat was the former castle believed to have once stood in the meadowlands outside town.

==Politics==

The municipal council is made up of 23 members. As of the last municipal elections held on 26 March 2006, 10 seats are held by the FWGW, a citizens&#x27; coalition, 8 are held by the SPD, and 5 are held by the CDU.

The municipal executive consists of 7 members. Three seats are held by the FWGW, 2 by the SPD, 1 by the CDU, and 1 by an independent.

==Culture and sightseeing==

===Buildings===
* Wartenberg castle ruins, from Hohenstaufen times (locally also known as &quot;Wartebach&quot;)
* Wartenberg-Oval

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===
Both Wartenberg&#x27;s centres of Landenhausen and Angersbach lie on Federal Highway (&quot;Bundesstraße&quot;) B 254 running from Alsfeld to Fulda, while Angersbach also has a station on the Vogelsberg Railway (&quot;Vogelsbergbahn&quot;) between Gießen and Fulda via Alsfeld.

<text>County Monaghan ( ; ) is a county in Ireland. It is in the province of Ulster and is part of Border strategic planning area of the Northern and Western Region. It is named after the town of Monaghan. Monaghan County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 65,288, according to the 2022 census.

The county has existed since 1585 when the Mac Mathghamhna rulers of Airgíalla agreed to join the Kingdom of Ireland. Following the 20th-century Irish War of Independence and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Monaghan was one of three Ulster counties to join the Irish Free State rather than Northern Ireland.

==Geography and subdivisions==
County Monaghan is the fifth-smallest of the Republic&#x27;s 26 counties by area, and the fourth smallest by population. It is the smallest of Ulster&#x27;s nine counties in terms of population.

===Geography===

Notable mountains include Slieve Beagh (on the Tyrone and Fermanagh borders), Mullyash Mountain and Coolberrin Hill (214 m, 702 ft). Lakes include Lough Avaghon, Dromore Lough, Drumlona Lough, Lough Egish, Emy Lough, Lough Fea, Inner Lough (in Dartrey Forest), Muckno Lough and White Lough. Notable rivers include the River Fane (along the Louth border), the River Glyde (along the Louth and Meath borders), the Ulster Blackwater (along the Tyrone border), and the Dromore River (along the Cavan border, linking Cootehill to Ballybay).

Monaghan has a number of forests, including Rossmore Forest and Dartrey Forest. Managed by Coillte since 1988, the majority of trees are conifers. Because of a long history of intensive farming and recent intensive forestry practices, only small pockets of native woodland remain.

The Finn Bridge is a border crossing point over the River Finn to County Fermanagh. It is close to Scotshouse.
==Geology==
Lead used to be mined in County Monaghan. Mines included Annaglogh Lead Mines and Lisdrumgormley Lead Mines.

==History==
In 1585, the English Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir John Perrot, visited the area and met the Irish chieftains. They requested that Ulster be divided into counties and land in the kingdom of Airgíalla be apportioned to the local chiefs. A commission was established to accomplish this and County Monaghan came into being. The county was subdivided into five baronies: Farney, Cremorne, Dartrey, and Monaghan controlled by MacMahon and Truagh by McKenna.

After the defeat of the rebellion of The Earl of Tyrone and the Ulster chieftains in 1603, the county was not planted like the other counties of Ulster. The lands were instead left in the hands of the native chieftains. In the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the McMahons and their allies joined the general rebellion of Irish Catholics. Following their defeat, some colonisation of the county took place by Scottish and English families.

==Inland waterways==
County Monaghan is traversed by the derelict Ulster Canal. However, Waterways Ireland are embarking on a scheme to reopen the canal from Lough Erne into Clones.

==Railways==
The Ulster Railway linked with and Belfast in 1858 and with the Dundalk and Enniskillen Railway at in 1863. It became part of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) in 1876. The partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Armagh into an international frontier, after which trains were routinely delayed by customs inspections. In 1957, the Government of Northern Ireland made the GNR Board close the line between and Armagh, and all lines between Armagh and County Monaghan. This left the GNR Board with no option but to withdraw passenger services between Armagh and Clones as well. CIÉ took over the remaining section of line between Clones, Monaghan and Glaslough in 1958, but withdrew goods services between Monaghan and Glaslough in 1959 and between Clones and Monaghan in 1960, leaving Monaghan with no railway service.

==Governance and politics==
===Local government===

At the 2019 local election, County Monaghan was divided into three local electoral areas, each of formed a municipal district: Ballybay–Clones, Carrickmacross–Castleblayney, and Monaghan.
===Former districts===
The towns of Ballybay, Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Clones and Monaghan were formerly represented by nine-member town councils which dealt with local matters such as the provision of utilities and housing. These were abolished in 2014 under the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

===National politics ===
For elections to Dáil Éireann, the county is part of the constituency of Cavan–Monaghan which elects five TDs. In the 2011 general election, there was a voter turnout of 72.7%.

For elections to the European Parliament, the county is part of the Midlands–North-West constituency.

==Culture and architecture==
County Monaghan is the birthplace of the poet and writer Patrick Kavanagh, who based much of his work in the county. Kavanagh is one of the most significant figures in 20th-century Irish poetry. The poems &quot;Stony Grey Soil&quot; and &quot;Shancoduff&quot; refer to the county.
County Monaghan has produced several successful artists. Chief among these is George Collie (1904–75), who was born in Carrickmacross and trained at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art. He was a prolific exhibitor at the Royal Hibernian Academy throughout his lifetime and is represented by works in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland and the Ulster Museum.

County Monaghan was also the home county of the Irish writer Sir Shane Leslie (1885–1971), 3rd Baronet of Glaslough, who lived at Castle Leslie in the north-east corner of the county. A Catholic convert, Irish nationalist and first cousin of Sir Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Leslie became an important literary figure in the early 1900s. He was a close friend of many politicians and writers of the day including the American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896–1940), who dedicated his second novel, &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;, to Leslie.

Monaghan County Museum is recognised as one of the leading provincial museums in Ireland, with a Council of Europe Award (1980), among others, to its credit. Located in Hill Street, Monaghan Town, the museum aims to reflect the history of County Monaghan and its people in all its richness and diversity.

The best of the county&#x27;s architecture developed in the Georgian and Victorian periods and ranges from the dignified public spaces of Church Square and The Diamond in Monaghan Town to the great country houses of Lough Fea, Carrickmacross; Hilton Park, Clones and Castle Leslie, Glaslough.

Significant ecclesiastical buildings include St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church in Carrickmacross; the Gothic-Revival St Patrick&#x27;s Church of Ireland Church, Monaghan Town, and St Macartan&#x27;s Catholic Cathedral, Monaghan Town, by James Joseph McCarthy (1817–1882).

==Economy==
Agriculture is a significant part of the County Monaghan economy, employing about 12% of the population in 2011 (compared with 5% nationally). The county is the main source of egg supplies in the Republic of Ireland.

<text>Kokiri is a settlement with a railway station on the Arnold River in the west of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island.

== Location ==
Kokiri lies on the Greymouth-Christchurch railway line, fourteen miles from Greymouth, and thirty-seven miles from Otira. It is also five miles from Stillwater Junction, and its railway station stands at an altitude of above sea level. The settlement is on the western bank of the Arnold river, in the Maori Creek riding of the Grey County.

== History ==
Kokiri became at the beginning of the 20th century one of the principal seats of the sawmilling industry, and many thousands of feet of timber and white pine sleepers were sent annually to Greymouth for export. The Kokiri Tramway and the sawmills of Baxter Brothers (William James Butler and Joseph Butler) and of Messrs Stratford, Blair, and Company gave employment to a considerable number of men.

In 1906 there was a railway flag station at the township, a post and telephone office, a State school and an hotel. A few small farms in the vicinity are held by some of the workers at the sawmills. At Maori Gully, close by, there were several good goldmining claims. The bush around the township consisted chiefly of silver pine, white pine and red pine, and beech, commonly called birch. There was game in the neighbourhood, and fishing in the river. At the census of 1901 the population was 103.

<doc id="404829" wikidata="Q2735001" url="?curid=404829" title="Islam in the United States">
<text>Islam is the third-largest religion in the United States (1.34%) after Christianity (67%) and Judaism (2.4%). The 2020 United States Religion Census estimates that there are about 4,453,908 Muslim Americans of all ages living in the United States in 2020, making up 1.34% of the total U.S. population. In 2017, twenty states, mostly in the South and Midwest, reported Islam to be the largest non-Christian religion.

The first Muslims to arrive in America were enslaved people from West Africa (such as Omar ibn Said and Ayuba Suleiman Diallo). During the Atlantic slave trade, an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the slaves brought to colonial America from West Africa were Muslims, however Islam was suppressed on plantations. Nearly all enslaved Muslims and their descendants converted to Christianity during the 18th and 19th centuries, though the Black power movement of the 20th century would later influence the revival of Islam among descendants of slaves. Prior to the late 19th century, the vast majority of documented Muslims in North America were merchants, travelers, and sailors.

From the 1880s to 1914, several thousand Muslims immigrated to the United States from the former territories of the Ottoman Empire and British India. The Muslim population of the U.S. increased dramatically in the second half of the 20th century due to the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished previous immigration quotas. About 72 percent of American Muslims are &quot;second generation&quot;.

In 2005, more people from Muslim-majority countries became legal permanent United States residents—nearly 96,000—than there had been in any other year in the previous two decades. In 2009, more than 115,000 Muslims became legal residents of the United States.

American Muslims come from various backgrounds and, according to a 2009 Gallup poll, are one of the most racially diverse religious groups in the United States. According to a 2017 study done by the Institute for Social Policy, &quot;American Muslims are the only faith community surveyed with no majority race, with 26 percent white, 18 percent Asian, 18 percent Arab, 9 percent black, 7 percent mixed race, and 5 percent Hispanic&quot;. The Pew Research Center estimates about 73% of American Muslims are Sunni and 16% are Shia; the remainder identify with neither group, and include movements such as the Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, or non-denominational Muslims. Conversion to Islam in large cities and in prisons have also contributed to its growth over the years.
==History==

=== Historical overview ===
Islam in the United States can be traced back to the 16th century when African slaves were brought to the United States of America. Historians estimate that between 15% to 30% of the enslaved Africans were Muslim. Most slaves who tried to maintain Islamic religious practices after their arrival were forcibly converted to Christianity. Some enslaved Muslims managed to preserve their religious practices. In the mid-seventeenth century, Ottoman Muslims are documented to have immigrated with other European immigrants, such as Anthony Janszoon van Salee, a merchant of mixed origin from Morocco. Immigration drastically increased from 1878 to 1924 when Muslims from the Balkans, and Syria settled in modern-day Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota. During that era, the Ford Motor Company employed Muslims as well as African-Americans, since they were the most inclined to work in its factories under demanding conditions. By the 1930s and 1940s, Muslims in the US built mosques for their communal religious observance. As of the early 21st century, the number of Muslims in the United States is estimated at 3.5 to 4.5 million, and Islam is predicted to eventually become the second-largest religion in the US.

===Early records===
One of the earliest accounts of Islam&#x27;s possible presence in North America dates to 1528, when a Moroccan slave, called Mustafa Azemmouri, was shipwrecked near what is now Galveston, Texas. He and three Spanish survivors subsequently traveled through much of the American southwest and the Mexican interior before reaching Mexico City.

Historian Peter Manseau wrote:
Muslims&#x27; presence [in the United States] is affirmed in documents dated more than a century before religious liberty became the law of the land, as in a Virginia statute of 1682 which referred to &quot;negroes, moores, molatoes, and others, born of and in heathenish, idolatrous, pagan, and Mahometan parentage and country&quot; who &quot;heretofore and hereafter may be purchased, procured, or otherwise obtained, as slaves.&quot;

====American Revolution and thereafter====
Records from the American Revolutionary War indicate that at least a few likely Muslims fought on the American side. Among the recorded names of American soldiers are &quot;Yusuf ben Ali&quot; (a member of the Turks of South Carolina community), &quot;Bampett Muhamed&quot; and possibly Peter Salem.

The first country to recognize the United States as an independent nation was the Sultanate of Morocco, under its ruler Mohammed ben Abdallah, in the year 1777. He maintained several correspondences with President George Washington. On December 9, 1805, President Thomas Jefferson hosted a dinner at the White House for his guest Sidi Soliman Mellimelli, an envoy from Tunis.

Bilali &quot;Ben Ali&quot; Muhammad was a Fula Muslim from Timbo, Futa-Jallon, in present-day Guinea-Conakry, who arrived at Sapelo Island during 1803. While enslaved, he became the religious leader and Imam for a slave community numbering approximately eighty Muslim men residing on his plantation. During the War of 1812, Muhammad and the eighty Muslim men under his leadership protected their master&#x27;s Sapelo Island property from a British attack. He is known to have fasted during the month of Ramadan, worn a fez and kaftan, and observed the Muslim feasts, in addition to consistently performing the five obligatory prayers. In 1829, Bilali authored a thirteen-page Arabic &quot;Risala&quot; on Islamic beliefs and the rules for ablution, morning prayer, and the calls to prayer. Known as the Bilali Document, it is currently housed at the University of Georgia in Athens.

====Nineteenth century====
On the morning of April 5, 1865, near the end of the American Civil War, Union troops commanded by Col. Thomas M. Johnston set ablaze the University of Alabama; a copy of the Quran known as &quot;The Koran: Commonly Called The Alcoran&quot; was saved by one of the university&#x27;s staff.

Estimates ranging from a dozen to two hundred and ninety-two Muslims served in the Union military during the American Civil War, including Private Mohammed Kahn, who was born in Persia, raised in Afghanistan, and emigrated to the United States. The highest-ranking Muslim officer in the Union Army was Captain Moses Osman. Nicholas Said (born 1836), formerly enslaved to an Arab master, came to the United States in 1860 and found a teaching job in Detroit. In 1863, Said enlisted in the 55th Massachusetts Colored Regiment in the United States Army and rose to the rank of sergeant. He was later granted a transfer to a military hospital, where he gained some knowledge of medicine. His Army records state that he died in Brownsville, Tennessee, in 1882. Another Muslim soldier from the Civil War was Max Hassan, an African who worked for the military as a porter.

A Greek/Syrian convert to Islam, Phillip Tedro (a name he reverted to later in life), born in Smyrna, who renamed himself Hajj Ali, &#x27;Ali who made the pilgrimage to Mecca,&#x27; (commonly spelled as &quot;Hi Jolly&quot;) was hired by the United States Cavalry in 1856 to tend camels in Arizona and California. He would later become a prospector in Arizona. Hajj Ali died in 1903.

During the American Civil War, the &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy of the North destroyed churches, farms, schools, libraries, colleges, and a great deal of other property. The libraries at the University of Alabama managed to save one book from the debris of their library buildings. On the morning of April 4, 1865, when Federal troops reached the campus with an order to destroy the university, Andre Deloffre, a modern language professor and custodian of the library, appealed to the commanding officer to spare one of the finest libraries in the South. The officer, being sympathetic, sent a courier to Brigadier General John T. Croxton at his headquarters in Tuscaloosa, Alabama asking permission to save the Rotunda, but the general refused to allow this. The officer reportedly said, &quot;I will save one volume as a memento of this occasion.&quot; The volume selected was a rare copy of the Qur&#x27;an.

Alexander Russell Webb is considered by historians to be the earliest prominent Anglo-American convert to Islam in 1888. In 1893, he was the sole representative of Islam at the first Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions. The Russian-born Muslim scholar and writer Achmed Abdullah (1881–1945) was another prominent early American Muslim.

In the 1891 Supreme Court case &quot;In re Ross&quot;, the Court referred to “the intense hostility of the people of Muslim faith to all other sects, and particularly to Christians&quot;. Scores of Muslim immigrants were turned away at U.S. ports in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Christian immigrants suspected of secretly being Muslims were also excluded.

===Slaves===

Many enslaved people brought to America from Africa were Muslims from the predominantly-Muslim West African region. Between 1701 and 1800, some 500,000 Africans arrived in what became the United States. Historians estimate that between 15 and 30 percent of all enslaved African men and less than 15 percent of the enslaved African women were Muslims. According to 21st century researchers Donna Meigs-Jaques and R. Kevin Jaques, &quot;[t]hese enslaved Muslims stood out from their compatriots because of their resistance, determination and education.&quot;

It is estimated that over 50% of the slaves imported to North America came from areas where Islam was followed by at least a minority population. Thus, no less than 200,000 came from regions influenced by Islam. Substantial numbers originated from Senegambia, a region with an established community of Muslim inhabitants extending to the 11th century.

Through a series of conflicts, primarily with the Fulani jihad states, about half of the Senegambian Mandinka were converted to Islam, while as many as a third were sold into slavery to the Americas through capture in conflict.

Michael A. Gomez speculated that Muslim slaves may have accounted for &quot;thousands, if not tens of thousands&quot;, but does not offer a precise estimate. He also suggests many non-Muslim slaves were acquainted with some tenets of Islam, due to Muslim trading and proselytizing activities.
Historical records indicate many enslaved Muslims conversed in the Arabic language. Some even composed literature (such as autobiographies) and commentaries on the Quran.

Some newly arrived Muslim slaves assembled for communal salat (prayers). Some were provided a private praying area by their owner. The two best documented Muslim slaves were Ayuba Suleiman Diallo and Omar Ibn Said. Suleiman was brought to America in 1731 and returned to Africa in 1734. Like many Muslim slaves, he often encountered impediments when attempting to perform religious rituals and was eventually allotted a private location for prayer by his master.

Omar ibn Said (c. 1770–1864) is among the best documented examples of a practicing-Muslim slave. He lived on a 19th Century North Carolina plantation and wrote many Arabic texts while enslaved. Born in the kingdom of Futa Tooro (modern Senegal), he arrived in America in 1807, one month before the U.S. abolished importation of slaves. Some of his works include the Lords Prayer, the Bismillah, this is How You Pray, Quranic phases, the 23rd Psalm, and an autobiography. In 1857, he produced his last known writing on Surah 110 of the Quran. In 1819, Omar received an Arabic translation of the Christian Bible from his master, James Owen. Omar converted to Christianity in 1820, an episode widely used throughout the South to &quot;prove&quot; the benevolence of slavery. However, many scholars believe he continued to be a practicing Muslim, based on dedications to Muhammad written in his Bible.

===Religious freedom===
Views of Islam in America affected debates regarding freedom of religion during the drafting of the state constitution of Pennsylvania in 1776. Constitutionalists promoted religious toleration while Anti-constitutionalists called for reliance on Protestant values in the formation of the state&#x27;s republican government. The former group won out and inserted a clause for religious liberty in the new state constitution. American views of Islam were influenced by favorable Enlightenment writings from Europe, as well as Europeans who had long warned that Islam was a threat to Christianity and republicanism.

In 1776, John Adams published &quot;Thoughts on Government&quot;, in which he mentions the Islamic prophet Muhammad as a &quot;sober inquirer after truth&quot; alongside Confucius, Zoroaster, Socrates, and other thinkers.

In 1785, George Washington stated a willingness to hire &quot;Mahometans&quot;, as well as people of any nation or religion, to work on his private estate at Mount Vernon if they were &quot;good workmen&quot;.

In 1790, the South Carolina legislative body granted special legal status to a community of Moroccans.

In 1797, President John Adams signed the Treaty of Tripoli, declaring the United States had no &quot;character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen&quot;.

In his autobiography, published in 1791, Benjamin Franklin stated that he &quot;did not disapprove&quot; of a meeting place in Pennsylvania that was designed to accommodate preachers of all religions. Franklin wrote that &quot;even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service&quot;.

President Thomas Jefferson defended religious freedom in America, including those of Muslims. Jefferson explicitly mentioned Muslims when writing about the movement for religious freedom in Virginia. In his autobiography Jefferson wrote &quot;[When] the [Virginia] bill for establishing religious freedom ... was finally passed, ... a singular proposition proved that its protection of opinion was meant to be universal. Where the preamble declares that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was proposed, by inserting the word &#x27;Jesus Christ&#x27;, so that it should read &#x27;a departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion&#x27;. The insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its protection the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo and infidel of every denomination.&quot; While President, Jefferson also participated in an iftar with the Ambassador of Tunisia in 1809.

However, not all politicians were pleased with the religious neutrality of the Constitution, which prohibited any religious test. Anti-Federalists in the 1788 North Carolina ratifying convention opposed the new constitution; one reason was the fear that some day Catholics or Muslims might be elected president. William Lancaster said:
:Let us remember that we form a government for millions not yet in existence ... In the course of four or five hundred years, I do not know how it will work. This is most certain, that Papists may occupy that chair, and Mahometans may take it. I see nothing against it.

In 1788, Americans held inaccurate, and often contradicting, views of the Muslim world, and used that in political arguments. For example, the anti-Federalists compared a strong central government to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the American army to Turkish Janissaries, arguing against a strong central government. On the other hand, Alexander Hamilton argued that despotism in the Middle East was the result of the Sultan not having enough power to protect his people from oppressive local governors; thus he argued for a stronger central government.

===20th century===

====Modern Muslims====

Small-scale migration to the U.S. by Muslims began in 1840, with the arrival of Yemenis and Turks, and lasted until World War I. Most of the immigrants, from Arab areas of the Ottoman Empire, came with the purpose of making money and returning to their homeland. However, the economic hardships of 19th-century America prevented them from prospering, and as a result the immigrants settled in the United States permanently. These immigrants settled primarily in Dearborn, Michigan; Paterson, New Jersey; Quincy, Massachusetts; and Ross, North Dakota. Ross, North Dakota is the site of the first documented mosque and Muslim Cemetery, but it was abandoned and later torn down in the mid-1970s. A new mosque was built in its place in 2005. Construction of mosques sped up in the 1920s and 1930s, and by 1952, there were over 20 mosques. Although the first mosque was established in the U.S. in 1915, relatively few mosques were founded before the 1960s.
* 1893: Alexander Russell Webb starts the first Islamic Mission in the United States called the American Muslim Propagation Movement.
* 1906: Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) in Chicago, Illinois, started the Džemijetul Hajrije (Jamaat al-Khayriyya) (The Benevolent Society; a social service organization devoted to Bosnian Muslims). This is the longest lasting incorporated Muslim community in the United States. They met in Bosnian coffeehouses and eventually opened the first Islamic Sunday School with curriculum and textbooks under Bosnian scholar Sheikh Kamil Avdich (Ćamil Avdić) (a graduate of al-Azhar and author of &quot;Survey of Islamic Doctrines&quot;).
* 1907: Lipka Tatar immigrants from the Podlasie region of Poland founded the first Muslim organization in New York City, the American Mohammedan Society which became the Powers Street Mosque. In 2017 they celebrated the 110 anniversary of their establishment.
* 1915: What is most likely the first American mosque was founded by Albanian Muslims in Biddeford, Maine. A Muslim cemetery still exists there.
* 1920: The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was established by the arrival of Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, an Indian Ahmadi Muslim missionary, he later purchased a building in south Chicago and converted it to what is today known as the Al-Sadiq Mosque which was rebuilt as purpose-built mosque in 1990s.
* 1921: The Highland Park Mosque was built in Highland Park, Michigan, although closed a few years later.
* 1929: The Ross Masjid in North Dakota was founded by Syrian Muslims, there is still a cemetery nearby.
* 1934: The oldest continuously and still standing building built specifically to be a mosque was established in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The mosque is where Abdullah Igram a notable Muslim veteran would teach the Quran, Abdullah Igram later wrote a letter to President Eisenhower persuading him to add the M option (for Muslims) on military dog tags.
* 1935: The statue of Mohammed was drawn on the north wall of the US Supreme Court building in 1935. Also, statues of Charlemagne and Justinian as one of eighteen great law givers of history are seen around the statue of Mohammed.
* 1945: A mosque existed in Dearborn, Michigan, home to the largest Arab-American population in the U.S.

&quot;Since the 1950s,&quot; many notable political activists and socialites with influence over politicians have come from the American Muslim community.

The Muslim population of the U.S. increased dramatically after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 into law. The act abolished former immigration quotas, and expanded immigration opportunities from countries with significant Muslim populations.

The Xoraxaya, Muslim Roma from Northern Macedonia, also came to the USA, where they founded mainly in the Bronx two Mosques.

Approximately 2.78 million people immigrated to the United States from countries with significant Muslim populations between 1966 and 1997, with some estimating 1.1 million people of that population being Muslims. One-third of those immigrants originated from North Africa or the Middle East, one-third originated from South Asian countries, with the remaining third originating from across the entire world. Immigration to the United States post-1965 favored those deemed to have specialized educational and skills, thus impacting the socio-economic makeup of American Muslims. The United States began seeing Muslim immigrants arrive in the late 20th century as refugees due to such reasons as political unrest, war, and famine.

==Subgroups of Muslim Americans==
According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 55% of Muslims in the United States are Sunni Muslims, with Shia Muslims representing roughly 16% of the American Muslim population of which there are also sub-sects within the Shia Muslim denomination such as Nizar&#x27;i Ismailism, Bohras, etc. The remainder identify with neither group, including some who consider themselves to be non-denominational Muslims.

===Black Muslim movements===

During the first half of the 20th century, several groups based on Islamic and Gnostic teachings combined with pseudohistorical colonial beliefs were established by African Americans.

====Moorish Science Temple of America====

The Moorish Science Temple of America is an American organization founded in 1913 by Noble Drew Ali, making it the oldest Islamic organization in the United States. Drew taught that black people were of Moorish origin but their Muslim identity was taken away through slavery and racial segregation, advocating the return to Islam of their Moorish ancestry. The founder stated that the organization practiced the &quot;Old Time Religion&quot; of Islamism, but he also drew inspiration from Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and Taoism. Its significant divergences from mainstream Islam make its classification as an Islamic denomination a matter of debate among Muslims and scholars of religion.

Its primary tenet was the belief that they are the ancient Moabites who inhabited the Northwestern and Southwestern shores of Africa. The organization also believes that their descendants after being conquered in Spain are slaves who were captured and held in slavery from 1779 to 1865 by their slaveholders.

Adherents of the Moorish Science Temple of America believe that the so-called &quot;Asiatics&quot; were the first human inhabitant of the Western Hemisphere. In their religious texts members refer to themselves as &quot;Asiatics&quot;, within the teachings of Noble Drew Ali, the members are taught man cannot be a Negro, Colored Folk, Black people, Ethiopians, because these names were given to slaves by slave holders in 1779 and lasted until 1865 during the time of slavery.

The Moorish Science Temple of America&#x27;s current leader is R. Jones-Bey.

====Nation of Islam====
The Nation of Islam (NOI) was created in 1930 by Wallace Fard Muhammad. Fard drew inspiration for NOI doctrines from those of Timothy Drew&#x27;s Moorish Science Temple of America. He provided three main principles which serve as the foundation of the NOI: &quot;Allah is God, the white man is the devil and the so-called Negroes are the Asiatic Black People, the cream of the planet earth&quot;.

In 1934, Elijah Muhammad became the leader of the NOI, he deified Fard, saying that he was an incarnation of God, and taught that he was a prophet who had been taught directly by God in the form of Fard. Two of the most famous people to join the NOI were Malcolm X, who became the face of the NOI in the media, and Muhammad Ali, who, while initially rejected, was accepted into the group shortly after his first world heavyweight championship victory. Both Malcolm X and Ali later became Sunni Muslims.

Malcolm X was one of the most influential leaders of the NOI and, in accordance with NOI doctrine, advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. He left the NOI after being silenced for 90 days (due to a controversial comment on the John F. Kennedy assassination), and proceeded to form Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity before his pilgrimage to Mecca and conversion to Sunni Islam. He is viewed as the first person to start the movement among African-Americans towards Sunni Islam.

It was estimated that there were at least 20,000 members in 2006. However, today the group has a wide influence in the African-American community. The first Million Man March took place in Washington, D.C. in 1995 and was followed later by another one in 2000 which was smaller in size but more inclusive, welcoming individuals other than just African-American men. The group sponsors cultural and academic education, economic independence, and personal and social responsibility.

The Nation of Islam has received a great deal of criticism for its anti-white, anti-Christian, and anti-semitic teachings, and is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

=====Five-Percent Nation=====

The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to as NGE or NOGE, the Nation of Gods and Earths, or the Five Percenters, is an American organization founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by a former member of the Nation of Islam named Clarence 13X (born Clarence Edward Smith and later known as &quot;Allah the Father&quot;). Clarence 13X, a former student of Malcolm X, left the Nation of Islam after a theological dispute with the Nation&#x27;s leaders over the nature and identity of God. Specifically, Clarence 13X denied that the Nation&#x27;s biracial founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was Allah and instead taught that the Black man was himself God personified.

Members of the group call themselves Allah&#x27;s Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those elites and agents opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the rest.

=====United Nation of Islam=====

The United Nation of Islam (UNOI) is a group based in Kansas City, Kansas. It was founded circa 1978 by Royall Jenkins, who continues to be the leader of the group and styles himself &quot;Royall, Allah in Person&quot;.

=====Conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam=====
After the death of Elijah Muhammad, he was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammed. Mohammed rejected many teachings of his father, such as the divinity of Fard Muhammad, and saw a white person as also a worshiper. As he took control of the organization, he quickly brought in new reforms. He renamed it the World Community of al-Islam in the West; later it became the American Society of Muslims. It was estimated that there were 200,000 followers of W. D. Mohammed at the time.

W. D. Mohammed introduced teachings which were based on orthodox Sunni Islam. He removed the chairs in the organization&#x27;s temples, and replaced the entire &quot;temple&quot; concept with the traditional Muslim house of worship, the mosque, also teaching how to pray the &quot;salat&quot;, to observe the fasting of Ramadan, and to attend the pilgrimage to Mecca.

A small number of Black Muslims however rejected these new reforms brought by Imam Mohammed. Louis Farrakhan, who broke away from the organization, re-established the Nation of Islam under the original Fardian doctrines, and remains its leader.

===Shia Islam===

An estimated 386,000 to 900,000 Shia Muslims live in the United States. They originate from South Asia, Europe, Middle East, and East Africa; and are often from the countries of: Islamic Republic of Pakistan, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and East Africa; Shiites in the United States also make up about 16 percent of the country&#x27;s total Muslim population.The &quot;heart of Shiism in the U.S.&quot; is placed in Dearborn, home to the Islamic Center of America. The North American Shia Ithna-Asheri (Twelver Shi&#x27;ism) Muslim Communities Organization (NASIMCO) is the largest umbrella group for North American Shias.

===Sufism===
Some Muslim Americans adhere to the doctrines of Sufism. The Islamic Supreme Council of America (ISCA) is a small body representing Sufi teachings, which, according to adherents, is the inner, mystical dimension of Islam. The ISCA&#x27;s stated aims include providing practical solutions for American Muslims, based on the traditional Islamic legal rulings of an international advisory board, many of whom are recognized as the highest-ranking Islamic scholars in the world. ISCA aims to integrate traditional scholarship in resolving contemporary issues affecting the maintenance of Islamic beliefs in a modern, secular society. It has been linked to neo-traditionalist thought.

===Quranic movement===
The largest Quranist movement in the United States is the United Submitters International. This movement was founded by Rashad Khalifa. His movement popularized the phrase: &quot;The Qur&#x27;an, the whole Qur&#x27;an, and nothing but the Qur&#x27;an&quot;. Although he was initially well received by many, his subsequent claims of divine inspiration caused friction between him and others, and he was assassinated in 1990. Notable Americans influenced by Rashad Khalifa include his son, Sam Khalifa, a retired professional baseball player, and Ahmad Rashad, a sportscaster and retired football player.

===Non-denominational Muslims===
Research by Pew in 2011 found that Non-denominational Muslims make up roughly one in seven of all American Muslims, at 15%. Non-denominational Muslims, do not have any specific affiliation with a religious body and usually describe themselves as being &quot;just a Muslim&quot;. Muslims who were born in the US are more likely to be non-denominational than immigrant Muslims. 24% or one in four US-born Muslims are non-denominational, versus 10% of immigrant Muslims.

===Ahmadiyya===
The Ahmadiyya Community was established in 1920 in the United States. Ahmadi Muslims were among the earliest Muslim missionaries in America, the first being Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, who arrived in America on February 15, 1920, and between 1921 and 1925 alone they converted over 1000 people to Islam. Although at first their efforts were broadly concentrated over a large number of racial and ethnic groups, subsequent realization of the deep-seated racial tensions and discrimination made Ahmadi missionaries focus their attention on mainly African Americans and the Muslim immigrant community and became vocal proponents of the civil rights movement. Officially incorporated in Illinois in 1948 as the Ahmadiyya Movement In Islam, Inc. and commonly referred to as the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community since 2006(?). Many Ahmadi Muslims fled countries like Pakistan due to persecution in recent times.

===Other Muslims===
There are some mosquegoers who adhere to sects and denominations that form very small minorities. Examples of such small branches include progressive Muslims, Mahdavi Muslims, Ibadi Muslims, and Ismaili Muslims.

==Conversion to Islam==
Some of the earliest Islamic missionary activities were undertaken by Alexander Russell Webb, who in 1893 established a mission in Manhattan, although it faltered due to lack of funding. From 1910 to 1912, Inayat Khan toured major American cities preaching Islam; he attracted large audiences though not as many converts. More successful in converting Americans to Islam was Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, who established a mission in Chicago in 1920. The converts Sadiq attracted tended to be African American. Soon after, African-American Muslim groups began to form: the Moorish Science Temple was established in Chicago in 1925, and the Nation of Islam formed in 1930.

According to an article in 2001, 25,000 Americans convert to Islam per year.

In more recent years, there has been significant conversion to Islam in the state, federal, and local prisons of the United States. According to J. Michael Waller, Muslim inmates constitute 15–20% of the prison population, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. Waller states that these inmates mostly come into prison as non-Muslims. He also says that 80% of the prisoners who &quot;find faith&quot; while in prison convert to Islam. These converted inmates are mostly African American, with a small but growing Hispanic minority.

==Demographics==

The U.S. Census Bureau does not collect data on religious identification. Various institutions and organizations have given widely varying estimates about the Muslim population in the U.S. Tom W. Smith, author of &quot;Estimating the Muslim Population in the United States&quot;, said that of twenty estimates he reviewed during a five-year period until 2001, none was &quot;based on a scientifically-sound or explicit methodology. All can probably be characterized as guesses or assertions. Nine came from Muslim organizations such as the Islamic Society of North America, the Muslim Student Association, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the American Muslim Council, and the Harvard Islamic Society or unspecified &#x27;Muslim sources&#x27;. None of these sources gave any basis for their figures.&quot; In 2005, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, more people from Muslim-majority countries became legal permanent United States residents—nearly 96,000—than in any year in the previous two decades.

According to CAIR, no scientific count of Muslims in the U.S. has been done and the larger figures should be considered accurate. Some journalists have also alleged that the higher numbers have been inflated for political purposes.

According to the 2010 US Religion Census, there were estimated to be 2.6 million Muslims and over 2,000 Mosques in the US. According to a Pew Forum estimate, in 2017 there were 3.45 million Muslims, constituting about 1.1% of the total U.S. population, compared with 70.6% who follow Christianity, 22.8% unaffiliated, 1.9% Judaism, 0.7% Buddhism, and 0.7% Hinduism. A Pew Forum report on American religion found that Muslims accounted for 0.9% of American adults in 2014, up from 0.4% in 2007, due largely to immigration. Retention rates were high, at 77%, similar to Hindus (80%) and Jews (75%); most people who leave these religions become unaffiliated, although ex-Muslims were more likely to be Christians than ex-Hindus or ex-Jews were. Conversely, 23% of American Muslims were converts, including 8% from historically black Protestant traditions, 6% from being unaffiliated, 4% from Catholicism, and 3% from mainline or evangelical Protestantism. By race, in 2014, 38% were non-Hispanic white (including Arabs and Iranians, up from 32% in 2007), 28% were Asian (mostly Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis, up from 20% in 2007), 28% were black (down from 32%), 4% Hispanic (down from 7%), and 3% of mixed or other race (down from 7%). Since 2007, the black proportion had shrunk, while the white and Asian proportions had grown, mainly due to immigration as most black Muslims were native U.S. blacks.

On the other hand, according to data from the General Social Survey in the United States &quot;32% of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18% hold no religious identification&quot;. and according to Pew Research, the number of American converts to Islam is roughly equal to the number of American Muslims who leave the religion.

===Race===
According to a 2001 study written by Ihsan Bagby, an associate professor of Islamic studies at the University of Kentucky, of Americans who convert to Islam, 64% are African American, 27% are White, 6% are Hispanic of any race, and 3% are other. Around that time increasing numbers of American Hispanics converted to Islam. Many Hispanic converts in Houston said that they often had been mistaken as of being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern descent, due to their religion. Many Hispanic converts were former Christians.

Since the arrival of South Asian and Arab communities during the 1990s there has been divisions with the African Americans due to the racial and cultural differences; however, since September 11, 2001, the two groups joined when the immigrant communities looked towards the African Americans for advice on civil rights.

===Religion===
According to a 2014 religious survey, 64% of American Muslims believe religion is very important, compared to 58% of American Catholics who believe so. The frequency of receiving answers to prayers among Muslims was, 31% at least once a week and 12% once or twice a month. Nearly a quarter of the Muslims are converts to Islam (23%), mainly native-born. Of the total who have converted, 59% are African American and 34% white. Previous religions of those converted was Protestantism (67%), Roman Catholicism (10%), and 15% no religion.

Mosques are usually explicitly Sunni or Shia although there are over 55 Ahmadiyya mosques as well. There are 2,769 mosques in the United States , and the nation&#x27;s largest mosque, the Islamic Center of America, is in Dearborn, Michigan. It caters mainly to the Shia Muslim congregation; however, all Muslims may attend this mosque. It was rebuilt in 2005 to accommodate over 3,000 people for the increasing Muslim population in the region. More than half (55%) of the religious affiliations of Muslims is Sunni, 16% Shia, 22% non-affiliated and 16% other/non-response. Muslims of Arab descent are mostly Sunni (56%) with minorities who are Shia (19%). Muslims of South Asian descent including Bangladeshis (90%), Indians (82%) and Pakistanis (72%) are mainly Sunni, other groups such as Iranians are mainly Shia (91%). Of African American Muslims, 48% are Sunni, 34% are unaffiliated (mostly part of the &quot;Community of W. Deen Mohammed&quot;), 16% other (mostly Nation of Islam and Ahmadiyya) and 2% Shia.

In many areas, a mosque may be dominated by whatever group of immigrants is the largest. Sometimes the Friday sermons, or khutbas, are given in languages like Urdu, Bengali or Arabic along with English. Areas with large Muslim populations may support a number of mosques serving different immigrant groups or varieties of belief within Sunni or Shia traditions. At present, many mosques are served by imams who immigrate from overseas, as only these imams have certificates from Muslim seminaries.

===Education and income===
The household income levels of American Muslims are about as evenly distributed as the general American population.

When it comes to education, the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding reported in 2017 that across the board, American Muslims, Protestants, and Catholics have similar education levels. It has also been found that Muslim women (73%) are more likely than Muslim men (57%) to go on to pursue higher education beyond high school, and they are also more likely to report being in the middle class.

Current estimates show that there are 270 full-time Islamic schools that enrol between 26,000 and 35,500 students in the United States. Islamic k-12 schools typically teach &quot;tawhid&quot;, or belief that God is the creator and sustainer of the universe; &quot;ilm&quot;, the imperative to seek knowledge; and &quot;ta’lim&quot;, and specific teaching about the Qur’an and &quot;ahadith&quot;. Some private Islamic schools in the United States cater to specific ethnic and/or cultural communities. Others enrol students from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities. Specific subject that are taught include Arabic, Qur’an, and Islamic studies along with academic subjects such as math, science, English, history, civics, and in some schools, art and music. Typically Islamic schools integrate religious knowledge throughout the curricula, incorporate prayer into their daily schedules, require modest dress, and serve halal food.

Among South Asians in the country, the large Pakistani American community stands out as particularly well educated and prosperous, with education and income levels exceeding those of U.S.-born whites. Many are professionals, especially in medicine (they account for 2.7-5% of America&#x27;s physicians), scientists, engineers, and financial analysts, and there are also a large number of entrepreneurs. There are more than 15,000 medical doctors practicing medicine in the USA who are of Pakistani origin alone and the number of Pakistani American millionaires was reported to be in the thousands. Shahid Khan is a Pakistani-born American multi billionaire businessmen and owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) making him the first and only ethnic minority member to own one, he also owns English Premier League team Fulham F.C., and automobile parts manufacturer Flex-N-Gate in Urbana, Illinois.

45 percent of immigrant Muslims report annual household income levels of $50,000 or higher. This compares to the national average of 44 percent. Immigrant Muslims are well represented among higher-income earners, with 19 percent having annual household incomes of $100,000 or higher (compared to 16 percent for the Muslim population as a whole and 17 percent for the U.S. average). This is likely due to the strong concentration of Muslims in professional, managerial, and technical fields, especially in information technology, education, medicine, law, and the corporate world.

===By state===
There were estimated to be about 4.5 million Muslim adherents across the United States in 2020.

====Population concentrations====
Generally speaking, Muslims are concentrated in the Eastern one-third of the United States, and particularly in the Northeast megalopolis, given the region&#x27;s relative proximity to the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia by flight.
New York City had the largest number of Muslims in the US with approximately 75,000. In 2000, Dearborn, Michigan, ranked second with 29,181, and Los Angeles ranked third with 25,673; although Paterson, New Jersey, in the New York City Metropolitan Area, was estimated to have become home to 25,000 to 30,000 Muslims as of 2011. The Muslim population in the New York metropolitan area approximates 1.5 million, the largest metropolitan Muslim population in the Western hemisphere.

As of 2020, New York was the state home to the highest absolute number of Muslims, by a significant margin, at over 724,000. By percentages of the population, Illinois, the State of New York, New Jersey, and Maryland all hosted population concentrations greater than 3%. Paterson in New Jersey has been nicknamed &quot;Little Ramallah&quot; and &quot;Little Istanbul&quot; and contains a neighborhood with the same name, with an Arab American population estimated as high as 20,000 in 2015. Philadelphia was estimated to have 30,000 to 50,000 Muslims as of 2012. Houston was estimated to have 63,000 Muslims as of 2012.

===Mosques===
In 2020, the US Mosque Survey identified 2,796 Islamic places of worship in the United States, a &quot;31% increase from the 2010 count.&quot; The U.S. states with the highest number of mosques were New York (343), California (304), Texas (224), Florida (157), and New Jersey (141), with New York gaining the highest number of mosques compared to 2011 (86 additional). As part of a sampled survey, the US Mosque Survey reports that 6% of mosques self identified as Shi&#x27;ite. Pew Research Center notes that 61% of respondents to the survey &quot;say that women have served on the board at some point in the last five years.&quot;

Previously, in 2011, the number of mosques in the United States was 2,106. At the time, the six states with the highest numbers of mosques were: New York (257), California (246), Texas (166), Florida (118), Illinois (109), and New Jersey (109).

In the United States in particular, it has been shown in a study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding that Muslim Americans who regularly attend mosques are more likely to work with their neighbors to solve community problems (49 vs. 30 percent), be registered to vote (74 vs. 49 percent), and plan to vote (92 vs. 81 percent). The study also states that “there is no correlation between Muslim attitudes toward violence and their frequency of mosque attendance.”

Regarding mosque attendance, data shows that American Muslim women and American Muslim men attend the mosque at similar rates (45% for men and 35% for women). Additionally, when compared to the general public looking at the attendance of religious services, young Muslim Americans attend the mosque at closer rates to older Muslim Americans. A Pew Research study found that women attendance at American mosques increased from 2011 to 2020, as did women participation in mosque administration, including positions on the board of trustees.

==Culture==

Within the Muslim community in the United States there exist a number of different traditions. As in the rest of the world, the Sunni Muslims are in the majority. Shia Muslims, especially those in the Iranian immigrant community, are also active in community affairs. All four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) are found among the Sunni community.

Muslims in the United States have increasingly made their own culture; there are various Muslim comedy groups, rap groups, Scout troops and magazines, and Muslims have been vocal in other forms of media as well.

Hijab is commonly worn by Muslim women in the United States, and is a very distinctive cultural feature of Muslims in America. According to a Pew Research Center poll from 2011, 36% of Muslim American women reported wearing hijab whenever they were in public, with an additional 24% indicating they wore it most or some of the time, while only 40% indicated that they &quot;never&quot; wore the headcover. Contrary to popular beliefs about assimilation, the study found that the number of women wearing hijab was in fact higher among native-born Muslim women compared to first-generation Muslim immigrants. In the 1990s, however, hijabs were not commonly seen in the United States, as overt Islamization became more apparent only during the 21st century. Compared to some nations in Western Europe, such as France and the Netherlands, there have been relatively few controversies surrounding the hijab in everyday life, a product of &quot;pro-religious freedom&quot; laws allowing for a wide range of religious accommodations, and also due to greater support for multiculturalism.

In his 2008 book &quot;Al&#x27; America&quot;, writer and journalist Jonathan Curiel wrote about the consequences of 9/11 on the perception of Islamic culture in America, stating that it has been difficult for some Americans to &quot;see Arab and Muslim culture as anything other than terrorism and fundamentalism&quot;. The Islamic experience in the US is also not well known or researched among mainstream society, with Jewish scholar Lior Sternfeld stating, &quot;Muslim-Americans were a much smaller and more marginalized community, but it&#x27;s changing.&quot;

==Politics==

=== Congress ===

As of the 119th US Congress, four Democrats identify as Muslim (0.8% total): André Carson, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Lateefah Simon.

=== Party politics ===
In the 2000 Presidential election, 78 percent of Muslim Americans supported Republican candidate George W. Bush over Democratic candidate Al Gore. However, due to increased anti-Muslim rhetoric from the Republican Party after the September 11 attacks, support for the Republican Party among American Muslims has declined sharply.
By 2004, Bush&#x27;s Muslim support had been reduced to under 1%, and Democratic candidate John Kerry&#x27;s support rose to 93%, with 5% voting for Ralph Nader.

By 2008, Democratic candidate Barack Obama got 67% to 90% of the Muslim vote depending on region. In total, Obama won 89% of the Muslim vote, with his Republican opponent John McCain getting only 2%. Some of his opponents question Obama&#x27;s religious faith; see Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories.

By 2012, Barack Obama&#x27;s support slightly falls to 85%, with 4% voting for his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney.

In a 2017 Survey done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, only 15% of American Muslims wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 presidential election, compared to 54% wanting Hillary Clinton to win. 74% of Muslims ended up voting for Clinton, compared to 13% for Trump.

According to a 2018 poll from the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, American Muslims were as satisfied with the American trajectory as the general public, reporting at around 27%.

This compares to, &quot;17% of non-affiliated Americans, 31% of Jews, 36% of Catholics, 41% of Protestants, and 72% of white Evangelicals&quot;.

According to the report belongs to a Boston-based organization that works to increase American Muslim education and civic engagement, &quot;at least 145 American Muslims, virtually all of them Democrats, ran for state or national public office in 2018. Of these, 110 were first-time candidates who represent an unprecedented rise for a diverse Muslim community that is typically underrepresented in American politics.&quot;.
In 2020, Democratic candidate Joe Biden received 69% of the Muslim vote, whereas Republican candidate Donald Trump received 17% (an increase from 13% in 2016) (excluding those who refused to answer, it would be 78% for Biden and 19% for Trump). Another survey showed that 86% of Muslims voted for Joe Biden, compared to just 6% for Trump. The remaining 8% either did not vote or supported a different candidate. 

American Muslim political engagement is increasing, as 75% of American Muslims surveyed by ISPU reported being registered to vote, an increase of 15% from 2016 data.

==Organizations==

One of the largest Islamic organizations is the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) which says that 27% of mosques in the U.S. are associated with it. ISNA is an association of immigrant Muslim organizations and individuals that provides a common platform for presenting Islam. It is composed mostly of immigrants. Its membership may have recently exceeded ASM, as many independent mosques throughout the United States are choosing to affiliate with it. ISNA&#x27;s annual convention is the largest gathering of Muslims in the United States.

The second largest Muslim organization is the community under the leadership of W. Deen Mohammed or the American Society of Muslims with 19% of mosques, mostly African-Americans having an affiliation with it. It was the successor organization to the Nation of Islam, once better-known as the Black Muslims. The association recognizes the leadership of Warith Deen Mohammed. This group evolved from the Black separatist Nation of Islam (1930–1975). The majority of its members are African Americans. This has been a 23-year process of religious reorientation and organizational decentralization, in the course of which the group was known by other names, such as the American Muslim Mission, W.Deen Mohammed guided its members to the practice of mainstream Islam such as salat or fasting, and teaching the basic creed of Islam the &quot;shahadah&quot;.
The third largest group is the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA). ICNA describes itself as a non-ethnic, open to all, independent, North America-wide, grass-roots organization. It is composed mostly of immigrants and the children of immigrants. It is growing as various independent mosques throughout the United States join and also may be larger than ASM at the present moment. Its youth division is Young Muslims. Why Islam? is a community outreach project of ICNA; it seeks to provide accurate information about Islam while debunking popular stereotypes and common misconceptions through various services and outreach activities.

The MSA is involved in providing Muslims on various campuses the opportunity to practice their religion and to ease and facilitate such activities. MSA is also involved in social activities, such as fund raisers for the homeless during Ramadan. The founders of MSA would later establish the Islamic Society of North America and Islamic Circle of North America.

The Islamic Information Center (IIC) is a &quot;grass-roots&quot; organization that has been formed for the purpose of informing the public, mainly through the media, about the real image of Islam and Muslims. The IIC is run by chairman (Hojatul-Islam) Imam Syed Rafiq Naqvi, various committees, and supported by volunteers.

* The American Islamic Congress is a small secular Muslim organization that promotes &quot;religious pluralism&quot;. Their official Statement of Principles states that &quot;Muslims have been profoundly influenced by their encounter with America. American Muslims are a minority group, consisting largely of immigrants and children of immigrants, who have prospered in America&#x27;s climate of religious tolerance and civil rights. The lessons of our unprecedented experience of acceptance and success must be carefully considered by our community.&quot; The AIC holds an annual essay writing competition, the Dream Deferred Essay Contest, focusing on civil rights in the Middle East.

===Charitable===
Charitable donations within the Muslim American community are impacted by domestic political and social climates. ISPU found in 2017 that, “23% of Muslim Americans increased their giving to organizations associated with their faith community and 18% joined, donated to, or volunteered at a civic organizations for the first time as a result of the 2016 national elections. A 2021 study showed that Muslim Americans donated more to charity than other Americans during 2020. Most of the donations were given to causes supporting poverty relief, COVID-19 relief, civil rights, and religious research.

In addition to the organizations listed above, other Muslim organizations in the United States serve more specific needs. For example, some organizations focus almost exclusively on charity work. As a response to a crackdown on Muslim charity organizations working overseas such as the Holy Land Foundation, more Muslims have begun to focus their charity efforts within the United States.

* Inner-City Muslim Action Network (IMAN) is one of the leading Muslim charity organizations in the United States. According to the Inner-City Muslim Action Network, IMAN seeks &quot;to utilize the tremendous possibilities and opportunities that are present in the community to build a dynamic and vibrant alternative to the difficult conditions of inner city life.&quot; IMAN sees understanding Islam as part of a larger process to empower individuals and communities to work for the betterment of humanity.

In 2014 CCN&#x27;s work was recognized with honors from the Governor of Illinois and also by President Obama at the White House. In 2015 CCN was invited to participate in White House policy recommendation discussions with the US Dept of Health and Human Services Office of Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.
*American Muslim Health Professionals is a nonprofit organization, founded in 2004, which aims to unite Muslim health professionals and provide information on health. They also provide information on mental health. Another of their goals is to connect Muslim Americans to affordable insurance and free health clinics.

===Research and think tanks===
The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, with offices in Dearborn, MI and Washington, DC, is an independent, nonpartisan research organization specializing in addressing the most pressing challenges facing the American Muslim community and in bridging the information gap between the American Muslim community and the wider society.

==Views==
===American populace&#x27;s views on Islam===
A nationwide survey conducted in 2003 by the Pew Research Center and the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life reported that the percentage of Americans with an unfavorable view of Islam increased by one percentage point between 2002 and 2003 to 34%, and then by another two percentage points in 2005 to 36%. At the same time the percentage responding that Islam was more likely than other religion to encourage violence fell from 44% in July 2003 to 36% in July 2005.

The July 2005 Pew survey also showed that 59% of American adults view Islam as &quot;very different from their religion,&quot; down one percentage point from 2003. In the same survey 55% had a favorable opinion of Muslim Americans, up four percentage points from 51% in July 2003. A December 2004 Cornell University survey shows that 47% of Americans believe that the Islamic religion is more likely than others to encourage violence among its believers.

A CBS April 2006 poll showed that, in terms of faiths
* 58% of Americans have favorable attitudes toward Protestantism/Other Christians
* 48% favorable toward Catholicism
* 47% favorable toward Judaism
* 31% favorable toward Christian fundamentalism
* 20% favorable toward Mormonism
* 19% favorable toward Islam
* 8% favorable toward Scientology

The Pew survey shows that, in terms of adherents
* 77% of Americans have favorable opinions of Jews
* 73% favorable of Catholics
* 57% favorable of &quot;evangelical Christians&quot;
* 55% favorable of Muslims
* 35% favorable of Atheists

Pew surveys conducted in 2014, 2017, and 2019 continued this trend showing Americans had the least favorable views toward Muslims and Atheists.

A 2011 Gallup poll found that 56% of Protestants, 63% of Catholics, and 70% of Jews believed that American Muslims had no sympathy for Al Qaeda. A 2015 Brookings poll found that 14% Americans believe most Muslims support ISIS and another 44% believe Muslims partially support ISIS. Political party also plays a role in whether Americans believe Islam encourages violence. Over the years, Republicans have become more likely to state they believe Islam encourages violence more than other religions, while Democrats are more likely to say it does not.

A 2016 poll found that on average; Americans believed that 17% of the US population was Muslim and that this number would rise to 23% by 2020.

A 2018 poll by The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding found that 86% of Americans report wanting to, “live in a country where no one is targeted for their religious identity.” 95% of American Jews and 78% of white Evangelicals agreed. The study also found that 66% of Americans agree that “the negative things politicians say regarding Muslims is harmful to our country.” Breaking down the results by faith community, 78% of Muslims and non-affiliated Americans agreed, contrasted with only 45% of white Evangelicals. Most Americans oppose banning the building of mosques (79%), the surveillance of U.S. mosques (63%), and a ‘Muslim Ban’ (~63%). Most Americans also take issue with the collective blaming of Muslims for the acts of individuals, and 69% of those surveyed believe Muslims are no more responsible for violence carried out by a Muslim than anyone else. ISPU writes that, “Though at a lower rate, the majority of Americans (55%) say that most Muslims living in the United States are committed to the well-being of America.”

According to a research by the New America foundation and the American Muslim Initiative found in 2018, 56 percent of Americans believed Islam was compatible with American values and 42 percent said it was not. About 60 percent believed US Muslims were as patriotic as others, while 38 percent they were not. The study also found that a big majority of Americans - 74 percent - accepted there was &quot;a lot&quot; of bigotry against Muslims existed. Researchers also found that Republicans were more likely to hold negative perceptions of Muslims with 71 percent.

A 2021 Pew study found that 78% of Americans believe Muslims face discrimination, which was a higher percentage than for other religions.

===American Muslims&#x27; views of the United States===

In a 2007 survey titled &quot;Muslim Americans: Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream&quot;, the Pew Research Center found Muslim Americans to be &quot;largely integrated, happy with their lives, and moderate with respect to many of the issues that have divided Muslims and Westerners around the world.&quot;

47% of respondents said they considered themselves Muslims first and Americans second. However, this was compared to 81% of British Muslims and 69% of German Muslims, when asked the equivalent question. A similar disparity exists in income, the percentage of American Muslims living in poverty is 2% higher than the general population, compared to an 18% disparity for French Muslims and 29% difference for Spanish Muslims.

Politically, American Muslims both supported larger government and are socially conservative. Despite their social conservatism, 71% of American Muslims expressed a preference for the Democratic Party. The Pew Research survey also showed that nearly three quarters of respondents believed that American society rewards them for hard work regardless of their religious background.

The same poll also reported that 40% of U.S. Muslims believe that Arab Muslims carried out the 9/11 attacks. Another 28% do not believe it and 32% said they had no opinion. Among the 28% who doubted that Arab Muslims were behind the conspiracy, one-fourth said the U.S. government or President George W. Bush was responsible. 26% of American Muslims believe the U.S.-led &quot;war on terror&quot; is a sincere effort to root out international terrorism. 5% of those surveyed had a &quot;very favorable&quot; or &quot;somewhat favorable&quot; view of Al-Qaeda. 35% of American Muslims stated that the decision for military action in Afghanistan was the right one and 12% supported the use of military force in Iraq.

Although American Muslims do report feeling discriminated against as a religious minority, they are just as likely as the general public (81%) to say they value their American Identity. In fact, a 2018 study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding asserts that, “a higher religious identity correlates with a higher American identity among all Americans, especially Muslims.”

===American Muslims&#x27; views on LGBT issues===
Similarly to the broader American public, U.S. Muslims have become more accepting of homosexuality in recent years. In a 2007 poll conducted by Pew Research Center, 27% of American Muslims believed that homosexuality should be accepted. In a 2011 poll, that percentage had risen to 39%. In a July 2017 poll, Muslims who say homosexuality should be accepted by society outnumber those who say it should be discouraged (52% of respondents, versus 33%), a level of acceptance similar to U.S. Protestants (52% in 2016). According to research by the Public Religion Research Institute&#x27;s 2017 American Values Atlas, 51% of American Muslims favor same-sex marriage, while 34% are opposed.

===American Muslim life after the September 11 attacks===
After the September 11 attacks, America saw an increase in the number of hate crimes committed against people who were perceived to be Muslim, particularly those of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. More than 20 acts of discrimination and violence were documented in the post 9/11 era by the U.S. Department of Justice. Some of these acts were against Muslims living in America. Other acts were against those accused of being Muslims, such as Sikhs, and people of Arabian and South-Asian backgrounds A publication in Journal of Applied Social Psychology found evidence that the number of anti-Muslim attacks in America in 2001 increased from 354 to 1,501 following 9/11. The same year, the Arab American Institute reported an increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes ranging from discrimination and destruction of private property to violent threats and assaults, some of which resulted in deaths.

In a 2007 survey, 53% of American Muslims reported that it was more difficult to be a Muslim after the 9/11 attacks. Asked to name the most important problem facing them, the options named by more than ten percent of American Muslims were discrimination (19%), being viewed as a terrorist (15%), public&#x27;s ignorance about Islam (13%), and stereotyping (12%). 54% believe that the U.S. government&#x27;s anti-terrorism activities single out Muslims. 76% of surveyed Muslim Americans stated that they are very or somewhat concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world, while 61% express a similar concern about the possibility of Islamic extremism in the United States.

On a small number of occasions Muslim women who wore distinctive hijab were harassed, causing some Muslim women to stay at home, while others temporarily abandoned the practice. In November 2009 Amal Abusumayah, a mother of four young girls, had her hijab pulled following derogatory comments while grocery shopping. In 2006, one California woman was shot dead as she walked her child to school; she was wearing a headscarf and relatives and Muslim leaders believe that the killing was religiously motivated. While 51% of American Muslims express worry that women wearing hijab will be treated poorly, 44% of American Muslim women who always wear hijab express a similar concern.

In 2011, The Learning Channel (TLC) broadcast a television series, &quot;All-American Muslim&quot;, depicting the lives of different American Muslims in Dearborn, Michigan.

Even 16 years after 9/11, studies show that 42% Muslim Americans report bullying of their children in school because of their faith. One in four bullying incidents involving Muslims is rerouted to have involved a teacher or other school official. Policies regarding immigration and airport security have also impacted Muslim American Lives after 9/11, with Muslims being twice as likely as any other faith group surveyed to be stopped at the border for additional screening. 67% of Muslims who were stopped at a US border also reported that they were easily identifiable as a member of their faith group. The climate of the 2016 presidential election and the policies that followed have also affected the lives and sentiments of Muslims Americans when it comes to their own safety. Muslims and Jews are, “most likely to express fear for their personal safety or that of their family from white supremacist groups as a result of the 2016 elections.” Overall, the majority of nonwhite Muslims do report some level of race-based discrimination in the past year. When it comes to religious based discrimination, Muslim Americans as a whole were the most likely faith group to report it.

==Concerns and perceptions==
A 2011 Pew poll reported support for extremism among Muslim Americans is negligible. The poll indicated all segments of the Muslim American population were opposed to violence and to a correlation between support for suicide bombing and religiosity measures. A 2007 Pew poll reported that very few Muslim Americans (1%) supported suicide bombings against civilian targets in at least some circumstances, with 81% reporting that suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians are never justified. Favorable views towards Al Qaeda were held by a comparably smaller percentage among Muslim Americans, 2% very favorable and 3% somewhat favorable. 15% of American Muslims under the age of 30 supported suicide bombings against civilian targets in at least some circumstances, on the other hand, 11% said it could be &quot;rarely justified&quot; in a 2007 Pew poll. Among those over the age of 30, just 6% expressed their support for the same. (9% of Muslims over 30 and 5% under 30 chose not to answer).
Terrorism that involved Muslim perpetrators began in the United States with the 1993 shootings at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, followed by the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City. After the September 11 attacks and the start of the Afghanistan war in 2001, there was concern about the potential radicalization of American Muslims.

Between 2001 and the end of 2009, there were 46 publicly reported incidents of &quot;domestic radicalization and recruitment to jihadist terrorism&quot; that involved at least 125 people between 2001 and the end of 2009. There had been an average of six cases per year since 2001, but that rose to 13 in 2009.

While the seeming increase in cases may be alarming, half &quot;involve single individuals, while the rest represent ‘tiny conspiracies,’ &quot; according to Congressional testimony. Furthermore, a 2012 study by the University of North Carolina indicated that the yearly number of cases of alleged plots by Muslim-Americans appears to be declining. The total of 20 indictments for terrorism in 2011 is down from 26 in 2010 and 47 in 2009 (the total since 9/11 is 193). The number of Muslim-Americans indicted for support of terrorism also fell, from 27 individuals in 2010 to just eight in 2011 (the total since 9/11 stands at 462). Also in apparent decline is the number of actual attacks: Of the 20 suspects indicted for terrorism, only one was charged with carrying out a terrorist act. This number is down from the six individuals charged with attacks in 2010.

Muslim Americans are significantly represented among those who tip authorities off to alleged plots having given 52 of the 140 documented tips regarding individuals involved in violent terrorist plots since 9/11 up to 2012.

The Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 caused 280 injuries, and 5 civilian and police deaths. Attempted attacks, like the Curtis Culwell Center attack and 2015 Boston beheading plot have attracted substantial media coverage and inflamed community relations. In 2015 the New America Foundation released information about violent extremist groups in the US. While the Boston Marathon bombing had a high injury toll, only four deaths were counted by the group, and the group&#x27;s count of only deaths from violent extremism showed that since 9/11, 48 people had been killed by anti-government extremists, compared to 28 by Jihadists.

Some Muslim Americans have been criticized because of perceived conflicts between their religious beliefs and mainstream American value systems. Muslim cab drivers in Minneapolis, Minnesota have been criticized for refusing passengers for carrying alcoholic beverages or dogs. The Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport authority has threatened to revoke the operating authority of any driver caught discriminating in this manner. There are reported incidents in which Muslim cashiers have refused to sell pork products to their clientele.

===Jihadist extremism===

In 2002, John Walker Lindh was convicted on charges of working with the Taliban and carrying weapons against American soldiers. He had converted to Islam while in the United States, moved to Yemen to study Arabic, and then went to Pakistan, where he was recruited by the Taliban.

José Padilla, a Hispanic-American, was convicted and imprisoned on suspicion of plotting a radiological bomb (&quot;dirty bomb&quot;) attack. After marrying a Muslim woman, Padilla converted to Islam and moved to the Middle East. While living in the Middle East from 2001 to early 2002, he was recruited and trained by al-Qaeda. On May 8, 2002, he was detained in Chicago. President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing that he was not entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison.

In 2015, a twenty four-year-old Kuwaiti man, Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, a naturalized US citizen with an engineering degree, killed four U.S. Marines were killed and injured three at two facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

===Islamophobia===

In the first half of 2024, anti-Muslim incidents rose about 70% amid Gaza attack. According to a 2011 Gallup poll, over the preceding decade, there had been an increase in Islamophobia, which it defined as &quot;an exaggerated fear, hatred, and hostility toward Islam and Muslims that is perpetuated by negative stereotypes resulting in bias, discrimination, and the marginalization and exclusion of Muslims from social, political, and civic life.&quot; Another 2011 poll provided by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; through the Public Religion Research Institute states that 48 percent of Americans are uncomfortable with Muslim women wearing the burqa. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that Muslims were the most disliked religious group in the United States with an average &quot;cold&quot; rating of 40 (out of 100), which is lower than the 41 cold ratings received by atheists. According to a poll in November 2015 by the Public Religion Research Institute 56 percent of Americans believe that the values of Islam are at odds with the American values and ways of life.

Public institutions in the U.S. have also drawn fire for accommodating Islam at the expense of taxpayers. The University of Michigan–Dearborn and a public college in Minnesota have been criticized for accommodating Islamic prayer rituals by constructing footbaths for Muslim students using taxpayer money. Critics said this special accommodation, which is made to satisfy the needs of Muslims alone, is a violation of Constitutional provisions separating church and state. Along the same constitutional lines, in 2007 a San Diego public elementary school was criticized for making special accommodations, specifically for American Muslims, by adding Arabic to its curriculum and giving breaks for Muslim prayers. Some critics said exceptions have not been made for any religious group in the past, and they see this as an endorsement of Islam.

The first American Muslim Congressman, Keith Ellison, created controversy when he compared President George W. Bush&#x27;s actions after the September 11, 2001 attacks to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s actions after the Nazi-sparked Reichstag fire, saying that Bush was exploiting the aftermath of 9/11 for political gain, as Hitler had exploited the Reichstag fire to suspend constitutional liberties. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Anti-Defamation League condemned Ellison&#x27;s remarks. The congressman later retracted the statement, saying that it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; for him to have made the comparison.

In April 2018, former President Donald Trump instigated a ban on Muslim immigration to America that still reverberates today. America had already some of the lowest percentages (about 1.1% of the total US population) of Muslims among Western nations, and with the ban in 2018, many African Muslims were also barred from traveling to the U.S. or seeking refuge there. The ban had a dramatic impact, but the measure was immediately rescinded in 2021, when Joe Biden took office. Muslim Americans, rights advocates and immigration experts, however, say the policy continues to have a lingering effect on Muslim citizens, as well as on their family members living abroad, unable to join their loved ones in America.

=== 2018 ISPU Poll ===

In the American Muslim Poll 2018, the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding set out &quot;to measure the level of public anti-Muslim sentiment&quot; in the United States.
The following graph shows data across six different faith populations in the United States, and their answers to the two questions below (&quot;W. Evang.&quot; is short for White Evangelical, the specific demographic surveyed):

Question 1: Some people think that for the military to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that this kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?

Question 2: Some people think that for an individual or a small group of people to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that this kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?
The following graph contains additional data collected by ISPU during their 2018 poll. The following statements were posed to participants and they were asked to answer on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The chart below shows the total percentage from each American faith demographic that agreed with the statements below. (Note: &quot;W. Evang.&quot; is short for White Evangelical, the specific demographic surveyed.)

Question 1: I want to live in a country where no one is targeted for their religious identity

Question 2: The negative things politicians say regarding Muslims is harmful to our country

Question 3: Most Muslims living in the United States are committed to the wellbeing of America

Question 4: Most people associate negative stereotypes with my faith identity

<text>The Labour Party (, PL), formerly known as the Malta Labour Party (, MLP), is one of the two major political parties in Malta, along with the Nationalist Party. It sits on the centre-left of the political spectrum.

The party was founded in 1921 as the Chamber of Labour by a small group of trade unionists. Ideologically, the party was orientated towards democratic socialism and other left-wing stances until the early 1990s, when it followed the lead of like-minded Western social-democratic parties like Britain&#x27;s New Labour. The party still claims to be democratic-socialist in their party programme. Under the rule of Joseph Muscat, the party shifted to a more centrist position, adopting Third Way policies. A formerly Eurosceptic party, it claims to hold pro-European stances and is a member of the Party of European Socialists, and the Socialist International.

== Party structure ==
The party structures are the General Conference, the National Executive, the Leader, and the Deputy Leaders, the Party Congress, the Party Administration, the Parliamentary Group, the Councillors&#x27; Section, the District and the Regional Administrations, the Local Committees, and the Branches.

The General Conference is largely made up of delegates from the Party&#x27;s other constituent structures and is the Party&#x27;s highest organ. The National Executive brings together the Party Administration as well as elected representatives of other constituent structures and co-ordinators. The Party Congress is made up of all members of the Party and elects the Leader and the two Deputy Leaders (one for Party, the other for Parliamentary affairs) and determines the Party&#x27;s broad policy outlines. The Party Administration is made of the Party Leader, Deputy Leaders, and Party officials. The Parliamentary Group and the Councillors&#x27; Section bring together the Party&#x27;s elected representatives in parliament and local councils. The Party is organised geographically in the local committees (smallest) and district and regional (largest) administrations. Finally, the branches of the party include the women&#x27;s, youth, senior, and candidates&#x27; sections.

===Media holdings===
Although not formally part of the party&#x27;s structures, the party owns a number of media and communication outlets, the largest being the television station ONE and radio service ONE Radio through its holding company ONE Productions. The party also owns the publishing house SKS (Sensiela Kotba Soċjalisti) and produces the weekly Sunday newspaper &quot;Kullħadd.&quot; The party formerly ran the travel agency Sunrise Travel and the MVNO RedTouch Fone.

== History ==

===Foundation, first years, and first government (1921–1949)===

The Labour Party was founded as the Chamber of Labour () in 1921 by one of the union branches affiliated with the Imperial Government Workers Union. Band clubs and other organisations were invited to send delegates to the Party&#x27;s founding meeting on 15 March 1921, significantly, the 30th anniversary of Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;.
Led by Colonel William Savona, the Party contested the general elections held in 1921 and 1924 under the new Constitution that gave the country a measure of self-government. The Labour-Constitutional alliance won the 1927 general elections, but Labour lost ground, gaining 13.9% of votes, three seats in the Legislative Assembly and no representation in the Senate. Strickland became prime minister. Labour leader Savona was not elected, and the leadership of the Labour parliamentary group was temporarily entrusted to Colonel Michael Dundon. The Presidency of the Party and leadership of the parliamentary group was taken up by Paul Boffa later that year. In 1930, it adopted a party anthem.

Labour gained nine seats out of ten in the elections held during November 1945, in which, contrarily to previous elections, all men over twenty-one years of age were entitled to vote. The Party&#x27;s electoral programme, for the first time in Labour&#x27;s history, did not make any reference to religion. Boffa&#x27;s Government was supported by the General Workers&#x27; Union, and it carried out a number of reforms, such as the abolition of the Senate, the abolition of plural votes, as well as the introduction of women&#x27;s right to vote. However, Labour deputies resigned from their posts in July 1946 due to mass redundancies at the Dockyards. In the meantime, the &quot;&#x27;MacMichael Constitution&quot;&#x27; had been introduced, granting self-government to the Maltese. Labour&#x27;s participation in the subsequent October 1947 elections was once again supported by the General Workers&#x27; Union. The Party won 59.9% of the vote and twenty-four seats out of the possible forty within the Legislative Assembly. Paul Boffa became prime minister whilst Dom Mintoff became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Reconstruction. The Labour Government introduced Income Tax and Social Services for the first time in Malta.

=== Re-founding and return to government (1949–1958)===

The Labour Party was re-founded in 1949 as a successor to the Labour Party founded in 1921. Paul Boffa, Leader of the Labour Party and prime minister since 1947, resigned and left the party because of serious disagreements with his Deputy Dom Mintoff which had led to a series of cabinet crises. Boffa formed the Malta Workers Party (MWP) while Mintoff re-organized the Labour Party as the Malta Labour Party. It has also adopted &quot;The Internationale&quot; as one of its anthems.

The Malta Labour Party contested its first elections for the Malta Legislative Assembly the following year. The old Labour vote was split equally between the MLP and the MWP, giving them eleven members each. This allowed the Nationalist Party (PN) to have a slight edge in the formation of a government, which it did in coalition with the MWP. The government did not last long. Two other elections were held in 1951 and 1953 (the last time a coalition governed in Malta) which both saw short-lived PN-MWP coalitions and the decline in the share of votes to the MWP with increasing support for the Labour Party.

The MWP eventually disintegrated and the MLP formed a government for the first time in 1955. This legislature was dominated by the issue of integration with the United Kingdom. The party, which started its life as an anti-colonial party with the slogan &quot;Integration or self-determination&quot; was now inclined towards the first part of the formula. A referendum was held in 1956 but given the number of abstentions and massive opposition by the Nationalist Party and the Catholic Church, the result was inconclusive. This, together with a number of dismissals at the naval dockyard led to Mintoff&#x27;s resignation and his call for massive protests in April 1958.

===Opposition (1958–1971)===
The Governor re-established direct colonial government which lasted until 1962. In the meantime, the Malta Labour Party&#x27;s connections with Third World Independentist and Socialist movements set it on a collision course with the Maltese Catholic Church, which the Party perceived as being pro-British and the cause of the failure of the Integration project. This led to the party leadership being interdicted from 1961 to 1964, when reading, advertising and distributing Party newspapers was deemed a mortal sin. In the 1962 elections, this led to the defeat of the Party at the polls as well as a split with the creation of the Christian Workers&#x27; Party. Peace with the Church would not be made until 1969 by which time the Christian Workers&#x27; Party had disintegrated.

The MLP participated in independence talks but disagreed with what was offered, causing them to not participate in the Independence celebrations when independence was actually achieved in 1964. The party made strong gains in the 1966 elections which, however, were not enough to see it in office.

An unimportant split occurred in 1969 when the Communist Party of Malta was founded. This split happened as a result of the truce between the Malta Labour Party and local Catholic authorities. The Communist Party has since only contested the 1987 elections.

===Post-independence Mintoff governments (1971–1984)===

Labour won the 1971 general election and immediately set out to re-negotiate the post-Independence military and financial agreements with the United Kingdom. The government also undertook socialist-style nationalization programmes, import substitution schemes, and the expansion of the public sector and the welfare state. Employment laws were revised with gender equality being introduced in salary pay. In the case of civil law, civil (non-religious) marriage was introduced and homosexuality and adultery were decriminalised. Through a package of constitutional reforms agreed to with the opposition party, Malta became a republic in 1974.

The Labour Party was confirmed in office in the 1976 elections. In 1981 the Party managed to hold on to a parliamentary majority, even though the opposition Nationalist Party managed an absolute majority of more than 4000 votes. A serious political crisis ensued when Nationalist MPs refused to accept the electoral result and also refused to take their seats in parliament for the first years of the legislature. Premier Dom Mintoff called this action &quot;perverse&quot; but it was not an uncommon one in any parliamentary democracy with disputed election results. He proposed to his parliamentary group that fresh elections be held, but most members of his Parliamentary group rejected his proposal. Mintoff, who had been considering vacating the party leadership position even before the elections, voluntarily resigned as prime minister and Party leader in 1984 (although he retained his parliamentary seat). A Party General Conference in that same year appointed Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici who acted uncontested as party leader.

===Post-Mintoff era (1984–1992)===

The Mifsud Bonnici years were characterised by political tensions and violence. The deadlock was broken when constitutional amendments were made voted and made effective in January 1987 which guaranteed that the party with an absolute majority of votes would be given a majority of parliamentary seats in order to govern. This paved the way for the return of the Nationalist Party to government later that year.

The Labour Party performed very badly in the following election in 1992, losing by nearly 13,000 votes. Mifsud Bonnici resigned due to deteriorating health and on 26 March, Labour elected Alfred Sant as the new leader.

===Sant leadership, modernisation, and challenges (1992–2008)===
Sant who won the election for party leader, and then modernized the party, secured a victory at the polls in 1996. Under Sant&#x27;s leadership the party made several changes. The party opened the new Labour Party Headquarters in Hamrun instead of the old Macina in Cottonera. The party also made giant steps in the media by being the first Maltese political party to own its radio and television stations.

Sant managed to win comfortably the 1996 elections held on 26 October by over 8,000 votes on the Nationalist Party. The 1987 constitutional amendments, which secured the necessary additional seats, had to be used for the second time, having been used for the same time in 1987. This same amendment had to be used a third time in 2008.

However, trouble was brewing. Mintoff, for reasons known to him alone (within the MLP), started creating problems in Parliament for the one-seat Labour parliamentary majority. In the summer of 1998, Labour lost a division vote on the proposed Cottonera waterfront project because of Mintoff&#x27;s renegation on his parliamentary group. This was considered by Prime Minister Sant as a vote of no confidence in his government and informed the then-President of the Republic that he no longer held a parliamentary majority as a result. The President had on various occasions asked Prime Minister Alfred Sant to try to find a solution for the political crisis created, but when all attempts proved futile, he had no other option but to accept Sant and his government&#x27;s resignation and a call for early elections, which were held on 5 September 1998. The Labour Party was defeated with a wide 13,000 vote margin.

Back in opposition, the party campaigned unsuccessfully against EU membership, and the &#x27;NO&#x27; camp lost the referendum for the ascension of Malta in the European Union on 8 March (although Sant claimed victory) and was again defeated in the general election a month later on 14 April 2003, once more with a 12,000 vote margin. Sant resigned but stood again for party leader, where he was re-elected with more than 65% of the votes.

In June 2004 the party succeeded in obtaining a relative majority of votes in the elections held to elect the first five Maltese MEPs for the European Parliament. The party elected three of his candidates: Joseph Muscat (later replaced by Glenn Bedingfield), John Attard Montalto and Louis Grech.

In 2008 the Labour Party lost for the third consecutive time in the 2008 general elections, obtaining 48.79% share of the vote and losing the election to the Nationalist Party by just 1,580 votes or 0.5%. Following the loss of the election, Sant resigned as Labour Party leader on 10 March 2008.

===Muscat leadership (2008–2020)===
The first round of the election of the new leader were held on 5 June 2008. Five members contested this election as candidates: George Abela (a former Deputy Leader), Evarist Bartolo (a frontbench MP and ex-Minister), Marie Louise Coleiro Preca (a frontbench MP and former Secretary-General of the Party), Michael Falzon (an MP and Deputy Leader of the Party) and Joseph Muscat (an MEP). In the first round neither candidate obtained 50%+1 the majority of the votes. So a run up election had to be held on 6 June between the top two candidates who obtained the most votes, George Abela and Joseph Muscat. Muscat was elected Labour Party leader, gathering 66.36% of the total votes. He was co-opted in Parliament and appointed Leader of the Opposition on 1 October.

During an Extraordinary General Conference, held in November 2008, it was decided that the party&#x27;s official name would be Partit Laburista instead of its former English name, the Malta Labour Party. The previous emblem was changed, although the symbol of the torch was retained.

In June 2009, the party garnered 55 percent of the first preference votes in the election for the European Parliament, electing three MEPs who sit with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. This result led to Labour a fourth MEP when the Treaty of Lisbon came into effect and the number of seats allocated to Malta increased from five to six.

Muscat managed to win comfortably the 2013 elections held on 9 March by over 35,000 votes on the Nationalist Party. The Labour Party won a massive 55% of the votes.

In the 2014 MEP elections, the Labour Party retained a majority of 34,000 votes (53%), but lost its fourth seat to the Nationalist Party candidate Therese Comodini Cachia.

In 2015, the party was delisted from the Socialist International for not paying membership fees.

In 2017, Joseph Muscat was re-elected during the general election, with Labour appearing to win with a clear landslide victory for the second consecutive time, merely an hour after the vote counting commenced.

Under Muscat&#x27;s leadership Malta&#x27;s national deficit was eliminated, unemployment decreased to historic lows, and an unprecedented period of economic growth occurred. However, he was criticised by figures on both sides of the political spectrum, accused of political opportunism, broken promises on meritocracy and the environment, as well as corruption allegations. On 1 December 2019, Muscat announced his resignation, to take effect after 12 January 2020, due to the 2019 Maltese protests caused by the murder of anti-corruption journalist and government critic Daphne Caruana Galizia. Muscat was accused of impeding the investigation. Robert Abela was elected to replace him, promising continuity with previous policies pursued by the party.

=== Abela leadership (2020–present) ===
As the party held a parliamentary majority at the time of Muscat&#x27;s resignation, Robert Abela would become prime minister immediately after, on 13 January 2020. He was recognized as the &quot;continuity&quot; candidate instead of Chris Fearne, emphasizing stability, unity and normality, as opposed to the bolder changes advocated by Fearne.

Abela is considered to be aligned to traditional Labour&#x27;s values, such as social housing and free medicine for the elderly.

In March 2020, Malta registered its first COVID-19 case. Abela was at first reluctant to close the Malta International Airport, retail outlets and the schools, but felt compelled to do so a few days later as public pressure mounted.

In April 2020, Prime Minister Abela called for &#x27;national unity&#x27; on Television Malta, the country&#x27;s national broadcasting television. This has been criticized for being partisan.

In November 2020, Abela stated &quot;that the party will continue to reinvent itself with the introduction of more young people and women at the centre of its decision-making process.&quot;

On 18 February 2021, Abela announced plans to introduce a law that would end police arrests for those possessing a small amount of cannabis and plants for personal use. This bill was passed in December 2021, and Malta became the first country in the European Union to legalise cannabis.

Abela&#x27;s leadership was criticised with the number of co-options that had taken place, being deemed as undemocratic.

In the 2022 general election, the Labour Party retained its majority in parliament, winning a third consecutive election for the first time since 1981 with 55.11% of the popular vote, the largest share since 1955, marginally surpassing the 55.04% it scored in 2017. Voter turnout was 86%. this was mainly because of various reasons including how Labour dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, the fact that the economy was still booming, and unemployment kept at a minimum low despite the pandemic and the way that Labour reinvented itself by tackling corruption and money laundering by ushered in a raft of rule-of-law reforms to counter claims of government corruption and grey listing of Malta by the FATF.

<doc id="404839" wikidata="Q1162337" url="?curid=404839" title="Logical block addressing">
<text>Logical block addressing (LBA) is a common scheme used for specifying the location of blocks of data stored on computer storage devices, generally secondary storage systems such as hard disk drives. LBA is a particularly simple linear addressing scheme; blocks are located by an integer index, with the first block being LBA 0, the second LBA 1, and so on.

The IDE standard included 22-bit LBA as an option, which was further extended to 28-bit with the release of ATA-1 (1994) and to 48-bit with the release of ATA-6 (2003), whereas the size of entries in on-disk and in-memory data structures holding the address is typically 32 or 64 bits. Most hard disk drives released after 1996 implement logical block addressing.

==Overview==
In logical block addressing, only one number is used to address data, and each linear base address describes a single block.

The LBA scheme replaces earlier schemes which exposed the physical details of the storage device to the software of the operating system. Chief among these was the cylinder-head-sector (CHS) scheme, where blocks were addressed by means of a tuple which defined the cylinder, head, and sector at which they appeared on the hard disk. CHS did not map well to devices other than hard disks (such as tapes and networked storage), and was generally not used for them. CHS was used in early MFM and RLL drives, and both it and its successor, extended cylinder-head-sector (ECHS), were used in the first ATA drives. However, current disk drives use zone bit recording, where the number of sectors per track depends on the track number. Even though the disk drive will report some CHS values as sectors per track (SPT) and heads per cylinder (HPC), they have little to do with the disk drive&#x27;s true geometry.

LBA was first introduced in 1981 by SASI, the precursor of SCSI, as an abstraction. While the drive controller still addresses data blocks by their CHS address, this information is generally not used by the SCSI device driver, the OS, filesystem code, or any applications (such as databases) that access the &quot;raw&quot; disk. System calls requiring block-level I/O pass LBA definitions to the storage device driver; for simple cases (where one volume maps to one physical drive), this LBA is then passed directly to the drive controller.

In redundant array of independent disks (RAID) devices and storage area networks (SANs) and where logical drives (logical unit numbers, LUNs) are composed via LUN virtualization and aggregation, LBA addressing of individual disk should be translated by a software layer to provide uniform LBA addressing for the entire storage device.

== Enhanced BIOS ==
The earlier IDE standard from Western Digital introduced 22-bit LBA; in 1994, the ATA-1 standard allowed for 28 bit addresses in both LBA and CHS modes. The CHS scheme used 16 bits for cylinder, 4 bits for head and 8 bits for sector, counting sectors from 1 to 255. This means the reported number of heads never exceeds 16 (0–15), the number of sectors can be 255 (1–255; though 63 is often the largest used) and the number of cylinders can be as large as 65,536 (0–65535), limiting disk size to 128 GiB (≈137.4 GB), assuming 512 byte sectors. These values can be accessed by issuing the ATA command &quot;Identify Device&quot; (codice_1h) to the drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Working Draft of ATA/ATAPI-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the IBM BIOS implementation defined in the INT 13h disk access routines used quite a different 24-bit scheme for CHS addressing, with 10 bits for cylinder, 8 bits for head, and 6 bits for sector, or 1024 cylinders, 256 heads, and 63 sectors. This INT 13h implementation had pre-dated the ATA standard, as it was introduced when the IBM PC had only floppy disk storage, and when hard disk drives were introduced on the IBM PC/XT, INT 13h interface could not be practically redesigned due to backward compatibility issues. Overlapping ATA CHS mapping with BIOS CHS mapping produced the lowest common denominator of 10:4:6 bits, or 1024 cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors, which gave the practical limit of 1024×16×63 sectors and 528MB (504 MiB), assuming 512 byte sectors.

In order for the BIOS to overcome this limit and successfully work with larger hard drives, a CHS translation scheme had to be implemented in the BIOS disk I/O routines which would convert between 24-bit CHS used by INT 13h and 28-bit CHS numbering used by ATA. The translation scheme was called &quot;large&quot; or &quot;bit shift translation&quot;. This method would remap 16:4:8 bit ATA cylinders and heads to 10:8:6 bit scheme used by INT 13h, generating much more &quot;virtual&quot; drive heads than the physical disk reported. This increased the practical limit to 1024×256×63 sectors, or 8.4GB (7.8 GiB).

To further overcome this limit, INT 13h Extensions were introduced with the &quot;BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive Services&quot;, which removed practical limits on disk size for operating systems which are aware of this new interface, such as the &quot;DOS 7.0&quot; component in Windows 95. This &quot;enhanced BIOS&quot; subsystem supports LBA addressing with &quot;LBA&quot; or &quot;LBA-assisted&quot; method, which uses native 28-bit LBA for addressing ATA disks and performs CHS conversion as needed.

The &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;none&quot; method reverts to the earlier 10:4:6 bit CHS mode which does not support addressing more than 528MB.


Until the release of ATA-2 standard in 1996, there were a handful of large hard drives which did not support LBA addressing, so only &quot;large&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; methods could be used. However, using the &quot;large&quot; method also introduced portability problems, as different BIOSes often used different and incompatible translation methods, and hard drives partitioned on a computer with a BIOS from a particular vendor often could not be read on a computer with a different make of BIOS. The solution was to use conversion software such as OnTrack Disk Manager, Micro House EZ-Drive/EZ-BIOS, etc., which installed to the disk&#x27;s OS loader and replaced INT 13h routines at boot time with custom code. This software could also enable LBA and INT 13h Extensions support for older computers with non LBA-compliant BIOSes.

=== LBA-assisted translation ===
When the BIOS is configured to use a disk in LBA-assisted translation mode, the BIOS accesses the hardware using LBA mode, but also presents a translated CHS geometry via the INT 13h interface. The number of cylinders, heads, and sectors in the translated geometry depends on the total size of the disk, as shown in the following table.

===LBA48===
The current 48-bit LBA scheme was introduced in 2002 with the ATA-6 standard, raising the addressing limit to 2× 512 bytes, which is exactly 128PiB or approximately 144PB. Current PC-compatible computers support INT 13h Extensions, which use 64-bit structures for LBA addressing and should encompass any future extension of LBA addressing, though modern operating systems implement direct disk access and do not use the BIOS subsystems, except at boot load time. However, the common DOS style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table only supports disk partitions up to 2TiB in size. For larger partitions this needs to be replaced by another scheme, for instance the GUID Partition Table (GPT) which has the same 64-bit limit as the current INT 13h Extensions. Windows XP SP2 is known to support LBA48 (and enabled by default).

==CHS conversion==
In the LBA addressing scheme, sectors are numbered as integer indexes; when mapped to CHS (cylinder-head-sector) tuples, LBA numbering starts with the first cylinder, first head, and track&#x27;s first sector. Once the track is exhausted, numbering continues to the second head, while staying inside the first cylinder. Once all heads inside the first cylinder are exhausted, numbering continues from the second cylinder, etc. Thus, the lower the LBA value is, the closer the physical sector is to the hard drive&#x27;s first (that is, outermost) cylinder.

CHS tuples can be mapped to LBA address with the following formula:

: &quot;LBA&quot; = (&quot;C&quot; × &quot;HPC&quot; + &quot;H&quot;) × &quot;SPT&quot; + (S − 1)

where
* &quot;C&quot;, &quot;H&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are the cylinder number, the head number, and the sector number
* &quot;LBA&quot; is the logical block address
* &quot;HPC&quot; is the maximum number of heads per cylinder (reported by disk drive, typically 16 for 28-bit LBA)
* &quot;SPT&quot; is the maximum number of sectors per track (reported by disk drive, typically 63 for 28-bit LBA)

LBA addresses can be mapped to CHS tuples with the following formula (&quot;mod&quot; is the modulo operation, i.e. the remainder, and &quot;÷&quot; is integer division, i.e. the quotient of the division where any fractional part is discarded):

: &quot;C&quot; = &quot;LBA&quot; ÷ (&quot;HPC&quot; × &quot;SPT&quot;)
: &quot;H&quot; = (&quot;LBA&quot; ÷ &quot;SPT&quot;) mod &quot;HPC&quot;
: &quot;S&quot; = (&quot;LBA&quot; mod &quot;SPT&quot;) + 1

According to the ATA specifications, &quot;If the content of words (61:60) is greater than or equal to 16,514,064, then the content of word 1 [the number of logical cylinders] shall be equal to 16,383.&quot; Therefore, for LBA 16450559, an ATA drive may actually respond with the CHS &quot;tuple&quot; (16319, 15, 63), and the number of cylinders in this scheme must be much larger than 1024 allowed by INT 13h.

===Operating system dependencies===

Operating systems that are sensitive to BIOS-reported drive geometry include Solaris, DOS and Windows NT family, where NTLDR (NT, 2000, XP, Server 2003) or BOOTMGR (Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2) use Master boot record which addresses the disk using CHS; x86-64 and Itanium versions of Windows can partition the drive with GUID Partition Table which uses LBA addressing.

Some operating systems do not require any translation because they do not use geometry reported by BIOS in their boot loaders. Among these operating systems are BSD, Linux, macOS, OS/2 and ReactOS.

<doc id="404841" wikidata="Q595575" url="?curid=404841" title="Social Democratic Party (Portugal)">
<text>The Social Democratic Party ( , PSD) is a liberal-conservative political party in Portugal that is currently the country&#x27;s ruling party. Commonly known by its colloquial initials PSD, on ballot papers its initials appear as its official form PPD/PSD, with the first three letters coming from the party&#x27;s original name, the Democratic People&#x27;s Party (, PPD). A party of the centre-right, the PSD is one of the two major parties in Portuguese politics, its rival being the Socialist Party (PS) on the centre-left.

The PSD was founded in 1974, two weeks after the Carnation Revolution. In 1976, the party adopted its current name. In 1979, the PSD allied with centre-right parties to form the Democratic Alliance and won that year&#x27;s election. One year later, the party&#x27;s founder and then Prime Minister, Francisco Sá Carneiro died in a plane crash. After the 1983 general election, the party formed a grand coalition with the Socialist Party, known as the Central Bloc, before winning the 1985 general election under new leader Aníbal Cavaco Silva, who shifted the party to the right. Cavaco Silva served as Prime Minister for ten years, instituting major economic liberalisation and winning two landslide victories. After he stepped down, the PSD lost the 1995 election. The party was returned to power under José Manuel Durão Barroso in 2002, but was defeated in the 2005 election. The party was able to return to power after the 2011 elections and four years later was able to win a plurality in the 2015 legislative election, winning 107 seats in the Assembly of the Republic in alliance with the CDS – People&#x27;s Party, but being unable to form a minority government and went back to the opposition. Nine years later, in 2024, the party returned to power as a minority government, under a rebranded Democratic Alliance coalition, alongside CDS–PP and the People&#x27;s Monarchist Party (PPM). The party elected its current leader, Luís Montenegro, on 28 May 2022. Since the 2024 election, Montenegro has been the incumbent Prime Minister of Portugal.

Originally a social democratic party, the PSD became the main centre-right, conservative party in Portugal. The PSD is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party and the Centrist Democrat International. Until 1996, the PSD belonged to the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party and Liberal International. The party publishes the weekly &quot;Povo Livre&quot; (&quot;Free People&quot;) newspaper.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===

The Social Democratic Party was born on 6 May 1974, when Francisco Sá Carneiro, Francisco Pinto Balsemão and Joaquim Magalhães Mota publicly announced the formation of what was then called the PPD, the Democratic People&#x27;s Party (). On 15 May, the party&#x27;s first headquarters were inaugurated in Largo do Rato, Lisbon. This was followed, on 24 June, by the formation of the first Political Committee, consisting of Francisco Sá Carneiro, Francisco Pinto Balsemão, Joaquim Magalhães Mota, Barbosa de Melo, Mota Pinto, Montalvão Machado, Miguel Veiga, Ferreira Júnior, António Carlos Lima, António Salazar Silva, Jorge Correia da Cunha, Jorge Figueiredo Dias and Jorge Sá Borges.

The publication was founded, its first issue being published on 13 July 1974, led by its first two directors, Manuel Alegria and Rui Machete. The PPD&#x27;s first major meeting was held in the , Lisbon, on 25 October, and a month later the party&#x27;s first official congress took place.

On 17 January 1975, 6300 signatures were sent to the Supreme Court so that the party could be approved as a legitimate political entity, which happened a mere eight days later.

In 1975, the PPD applied unsuccessfully to join the Socialist International, with its membership attempt vetoed by the Socialist Party.

Alberto João Jardim was the co-founder of the Madeiran branch of the PSD, and governed the autonomous archipelago for decades, running as a member of the party.

=== Democratic Alliance governments ===
The Democratic People&#x27;s Party participated in a number of coalition governments in Portugal between 1974 and 1976, following the Carnation Revolution. This is seen as a transitional period in Portuguese politics, in which political institutions were built and took time to stabilize. In 1976, the party adopted its current name. In 1979, the PSD formed an electoral alliance, known as the Democratic Alliance (AD), with the Democratic and Social Centre (now called the People&#x27;s Party, CDS-PP) and a couple of smaller right-wing parties. The AD won the parliamentary elections towards the end of 1979, and the PSD leader, Francisco Sá Carneiro, became Prime Minister. The PSD would be part of all governments until 1995. The AD increased its parliamentary majority in new elections called for 1980, but was devastated by the death of Sá Caneiro in an air crash on 4 December 1980. Francisco Pinto Balsemão took over the leadership of both the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Alliance, as well as the Prime Ministership, but lacking Sá Carneiro&#x27;s charisma, he was unable to rally popular support.

The Democratic Alliance was dissolved in 1983, and in parliamentary elections that year, the PSD lost to the Socialist Party (PS). Falling short of a majority, the Socialists formed a grand coalition, known as the Central Bloc, with the PSD. Many right-wingers in the PSD, including Aníbal Cavaco Silva, opposed participation in the PS-led government, and so, when Cavaco Silva was elected leader of the party on 2 June 1985, the coalition was doomed.

=== Cavaco Silva governments (1985–1995) ===

The PSD won a plurality (but not a majority) in the general election of 1985, and Cavaco Silva became Prime Minister. Economic liberalization and tax cuts ushered in several years of economic growth. After a motion of no confidence was approved, early elections were called for July 1987, which resulted in a landslide victory for the PSD, who captured 50.2 percent of the popular vote and 148 of the 250 parliamentary seats – the first time that any political party in Portugal had mustered an absolute majority in a free election. While the PSD had been very popular going into the election, the size of its victory far exceeded the party&#x27;s most optimistic projections. A strong economy, growing above 7 percent in 1988, ushered a big convergence between Portugal and other EU countries.

The PSD won a historic third term in the 1991 election, with a slightly higher vote share than four years earlier, 50.6 percent. The early 1990s recession hit Portugal in 1993 and high levels of unemployment adding to this fiscal adjustments, eroded the popularity of the Cavaco Silva&#x27;s government. The anti-tolls riots in 25 de Abril Bridge in June 1994 and the violent response from security forces, further undermined Cavaco Silva&#x27;s position. In early 1995, Cavaco Silva announced he would not run for a fourth term as Prime Minister.

=== Post-Cavaco Silva ===
After Cavaco Silva stepped down as leader in January 1995, in the following month, in the PSD congress, the party elected Fernando Nogueira as leader. The PSD lost the 1995 election to the PS. In 1996, Cavaco Silva ran for the presidency of the republic, but he failed to defeat former Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio. Sampaio won 53.9 percent to Cavaco&#x27;s 46.1 percent. The party, for the first time in 16 years, was out of government. In 1996, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was elected party leader, and held that post until 1999. At the time, the party reviewed its membership database, resulting in a correction from 183,000 in 1996 to 77,000 in 1999. Rebelo de Sousa resigned in April 1999 and shortly after, José Manuel Durão Barroso was elected party leader. The party was again defeated in the 1999 elections. The party made a big comeback in the 2001 local elections by winning several cities, like Lisbon, Porto and Sintra, from the PS and, some, against all odds and predictions. This PSD result led the then Prime Minister António Guterres (PS) to resign and the country was led to snap general elections in March 2002.

=== First PSD/CDS coalition government (2002–2005) ===

The PSD made a comeback in 2002, defeating the PS by a 40 to 38 percent margin. Despite falling short of a majority, it won enough seats to form a coalition with the CDS-PP and its leader, José Manuel Durão Barroso, became Prime Minister. During his term, Barroso aligned Portugal with the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain in the support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, hosting a summit in Lajes Field, which divided public opinion. 

In the 2004 European Parliament election, the PSD formed an electoral coalition with CDS-PP, the first since 1980, but was soundly defeated by the PS by 45 to 33 percent margin. A few days after the election, Durão Barroso announced his resignation from the office of Prime Minister in order to become President of the European Commission, leaving the way for Pedro Santana Lopes, by then Mayor of Lisbon and a man with whom he was frequently at odds, to become leader of the party and Prime Minister.

=== Back in opposition (2005–2011) ===
In the parliamentary election held on 20 February 2005, Santana Lopes led the PSD to its worst defeat since 1983. With a negative swing of more than 12 percent, the party won only 75 seats, a loss of 30. The rival Socialist Party had won an absolute majority, and remained in government after the 2009 parliamentary election, albeit without an absolute majority, leaving the PSD in opposition.

The PSD-supported candidate Aníbal Cavaco Silva won the Portuguese presidential elections in 2006 and again in 2011. After the 2005 elections, Luís Marques Mendes was elected leader of the party. Internal infighting weakened Marques Mendes and, in September 2007, Marques Mendes was defeated by Luís Filipe Menezes by a 54% to 42% margin. Menezes was also incapable of dealing with his internal opposition and, after just six months in the job, Menezes resigned. On 31 May 2008, Manuela Ferreira Leite became the first female leader of a major Portuguese party. She won 38 percent of the votes, against the 31% of Pedro Passos Coelho and the 30% of Pedro Santana Lopes.

In the European Parliament election held on 7 June 2009, the PSD defeated the governing socialists, capturing 31.7 percent of the popular vote and electing eight MEPs, while the Socialist Party only won 26.5 percent and elected seven MEPs.

Although this was expected to be a &quot;redrawing of the electoral map&quot;, the PSD has still defeated later that year, though the PS lost its majority. Pedro Passos Coelho was elected leader in March 2010, with 61 percent of the votes.

=== Second PSD/CDS coalition government (2011–2015) ===
Growing popular disenchantment with the government&#x27;s handling of the economic crisis coupled with the government&#x27;s inability to secure the support of other parties to implement the necessary reforms to address the crisis, forced the Socialist Party Prime Minister José Sócrates to resign, leading to a fresh election on 5 June 2011. This resulted in a non-absolute majority for the PSD, leading to a coalition government with the CDS-PP, which served a full term until the 2015 general election. During this term, many austerity policies were put into practice to reduce the budget deficit but, ultimately, created unemployment and a recession that lasted until mid 2013. Since that date, the economy recovered starting to grow between 1 and 2 percent per trimester.

In the 2015 general election, the PSD and CDS-PP ran in a joint coalition, called Portugal Ahead, led by Pedro Passos Coelho and Paulo Portas. The coalition won the elections by a wide margin over the Socialists, capturing 38.6 percent of the votes while the Socialists captured only 32 percent, although the coalition lost 25 MPs and a more than 11 percent of the votes, thus falling well short of an absolute majority. The PSD/CDS-PP coalition was asked by the then President of the Republic, Aníbal Cavaco Silva, to form a government with Passos Coelho as Prime Minister.

=== Back in opposition (2015–2024) ===

The second PSD/CDS government was duly formed and took the oath of office on 30 October 2015, but fell after a no-confidence motion was approved two weeks later. Its 11 days of rule make it the shortest-lived government since Portugal has been a democracy holding free elections. After that, the PSD returned to the opposition benches, and the Socialist Party was able to form an agreement with BE and CDU to support a PS minority government led by António Costa. Pedro Passos Coelho continued as party leader, but a weak opposition strategy led to bad polling numbers for the PSD. All of this culminated with the results of the 2017 local elections. In these elections, the PSD achieved their worst results ever, winning just 98 mayors and 30 percent of the votes. Passos Coelho announced he would not run for another term as PSD leader. On 13 January 2018, Rui Rio defeated Pedro Santana Lopes by a 54 to 46 percent margin and became the new party leader. After 10 years of Cavaco Silva as President of the Republic, the PSD-supported candidate, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, was elected President in 2016, and reelected in 2021.

In order to avoid bankruptcy due to mounting debt, in 2017, the party, alongside the Portuguese Socialist Party, the Portuguese Communist Party, BE and the ecologist party PEV, voted in favour of abolishing party fundraising limits, thereby opening all Portuguese parties to private political donorship, that they are not obligated to disclose. The new proposal was reluctantly approved by the Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.

During his first year in the leadership, Rio faced big internal opposition and, in January 2019, Rio won a motion of confidence presented by Luís Montenegro. In the EP 2019 elections, the PSD achieved their worst result ever in a national election, winning just 22 percent of the votes. The party recovered a lot of ground in the October 2019 general elections, achieving 28 percent of the votes, against the 36 percent of the PS. Nonetheless, Rio&#x27;s leadership was, once again, challenged and he faced, in a two round leadership contest in January 2020, Luís Montenegro and Miguel Pinto Luz. Rio won the 1st round with 49% of the votes and defeated Luís Montenegro in the 2nd round by 53 to 47 percent margin, thus being reelected as party leader.

In the Azores 2020 regional elections, the PSD was able to return to power, after 24 years in opposition, by forging a controversial deal with CHEGA, plus CDS, PPM and IL. The PSD won almost 34 percent of the votes, while the PS fell more than 7 pp, compared with 2016, to 39 percent, an unexpected result, and overall the right wing parties had a 1-seat majority over all the left. After 2020, the PSD controls the governments of Portugal&#x27;s only two autonomous regions.

The 2021 local elections were quite positive for the PSD, despite not winning the most mayors in the country as a whole. The party, and its led-coalitions, won a combined 32 percent of the votes and were able to win, from the PS, several cities like Coimbra, Funchal and Barcelos. The main gain of the PSD was the victory in Lisbon, where Carlos Moedas defeated, against all odds and predictions, the PS incumbent mayor Fernando Medina. In October 2021, disagreements between the PS and BE-CDU led to the rejection of the 2022 budget and the calling of a snap general election for 30 January 2022. Despite a close race predicted by polls, the PSD suffered a big setback by winning just 29% of the votes and seeing the PS gaining a surprise absolute majority, with 41% of the votes. After the election, PSD leader Rui Rio opened the process to elect a new party leader. On 28 May 2022, Luís Montenegro was elected party leader by a landslide, gathering more than 72 percent of the votes.

=== Return to power (2024–present) ===
Following António Costa&#x27;s resignation due to an investigation around alleged corruption involving the award of contracts for lithium and hydrogen businesses, a snap election was called for 10 March 2024. For this election, PSD, CDS–PP and PPM decided to contest the election in a joint alliance called &quot;Democratic Alliance&quot; (AD). On election day, the AD won by a narrow 29 to 28 percent margin over the Socialist Party, and formed a minority government. Three months later, in the 2024 European Parliament elections, the AD coalition was narrowly defeated by the Socialists, 31 to 32 percent.

== Ideology ==
=== Historical evolution ===
The party was founded based on classical social democracy and was a centre to centre-left party. It later became a catch-all centre-right party. The party has been described as liberal-conservative, conservative, or conservative-liberal, with Christian democratic, liberal and economically liberal elements.

=== Factions ===
The PSD is frequently referred to as a party that is not ideology-based, but rather a power party (). It frequently adopts a functional big tent party strategy to win elections. Due to this strategy, which most trace to Cavaco Silva&#x27;s leadership, the party is made up of many factions, mostly centre-right (including liberal democrats, Christian democrats and neoconservatives) as well as quasi-social-democrats and former communists:
The main faction when the party was created, throughout the party&#x27;s history rightist politicians joined them to have a greater chance of gaining power and influencing the country&#x27;s politics (see liberals, conservatives, right-wing populists and neoliberals). They do not follow traditional social democracy, but Portuguese social democracy as defined by Francisco Sá Carneiro&#x27;s actions and writings, which includes a degree of centrist and leftist populism. They followed a kind of anti-class struggle party/cross-class party strategy. All the other members of the party claim to follow this line. Among its representatives were most of the leaders between Francisco Sá Carneiro and Cavaco Silva, Alberto João Jardim (also a founding member and an anti-neoliberal) and to an extent Luís Filipe Menezes (who called the PSD the &quot;moderate left party&quot;) identified himself with a centre-left matrix and a united left strategy and defended a more open party on issues like abortion. José Mendes Bota is another left-wing populist. The Portuguese social-democrats are centered around the (Boavista Group).
Follow traditional social democracy. They share with the Portuguese social democrats their presence at the creation of the party and &quot;a non-Marxist progressivist line&quot;. Many of them (former party leader António Sousa Franco, party co-founder Magalhães Mota, writer and feminist Natália Correia) supported the (Pressing Options) manifesto, and then left to create the Independent Social Democrat Association (, ASDI) and the Social Democrat Movement (, MSD), forming electoral coalitions (later merging with) the Socialist Party during the 1970s–1980s. Some took part in the Democratic Renovator Party. A later example of a European-style Social democrat leaving the party for the Socialists is activist and politician Helena Roseta. The ones still in the party adapted to its current right-wing outlook or Portuguese social democracy. They today include former communists-turned centre-leftists, like Zita Seabra. Durão Barroso might have moved from Thatcherism to social democracy. Ironically, both Social Democrat factions were represented in the 2008 party elections by Manuela Ferreira Leite, economically neoliberal and socially conservative (often compared to Thatcher).
The other main faction at creation. The PSD was always more successful in the Northern and rural areas of the country. When Sousa Franco and his SPD-inspired social democrats started their break with the rest of the party he referred to a division between &quot;a rural wing, led by Sá Carneiro, and an urban wing, more moderate and truly social democratic, close to the positions of Helmut Schmidt&quot; Due to the electoral influence of ruralism on the PSD&#x27;s politics they may be seen inside of or influencing most factions.
Due to the Salazarist connotation of the term right-wing and all terms connected (liberal and conservative) after the Carnation Revolution, the little attractiveness of economic liberalism in European politics, no specific liberal or conservative party was formed in post-1974 Portugal, except the experiences of the Catholic Action-monarchist Liberal Party in 1974 and the centrist liberal Democratic Renovator Party, so they started working inside the PSD. This strategy of joining &quot;socialism and liberalism under the same hat&quot; was especially successful during Cavaco Silva&#x27;s leadership, when the party gave up its candidacy to the Socialist International and became member of the Liberal International and European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party and Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group, leaving the international and the European party and group in 1996 to join the Christian Democrat International (today Centrist Democrat International), the European People&#x27;s Party and the European People&#x27;s Party-European Democrats. Since then, the liberal-social democrat rift (or even the liberal-conservative-populist-social democrat rift) has plagued the party&#x27;s cohesion and actions. Durão Barroso (a former revolutionary Maoist who switched sides in the 1980s) is sometimes referred to as the most pure liberal of the party. In terms of social liberals, some try to link both social democracy and social liberalism to the PSD, to refer to the early PSD as liberal or partly social liberal party and social liberalism is sometimes identified with the social market economy tradition the party traditionally supported. Even members of the Portuguese Social Liberal Movement admit the traditional and current presence of social liberals (and other liberals) on the PSD.
Some claim the PSD as the party from Christian democracy and social Christianity from the beginning, or having these currents as part of its legacy. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is one of the main preachers of Social Christianity inside the PSD. As is Paulo Rangel.
Distinct from radical right-wing populists, the populist centre and centre-left social democrats (like João Jardim and Sá Carneiro), the populist overlappers (like Cavaco Silva), and the Eurosceptic populists of the Democratic and Social Centre–People&#x27;s Party (CDS-PP). They are social-economic liberal conservative/conservative liberal and moderate culturally religious conservatives and internationalist national conservatives. Their main representative is Pedro Santana Lopes. Though the main right-wing populists were present at the founding of the party (like Santana Lopes), they were clearly right-wing, recruited when their abilities were noticed in educated circles and universities, with minor agreements with Sá Carneiro&#x27;s philosophy. Frequently as the PSD is a bipartisanship party, right-wing populists from the CDS-PP join the party. Luís Filipe Meneses is frequently described as a populist but he tried to lead the party back to a left line, and does not identify or act like the liberal conservative/conservative liberal populists.
With the post-revolutionary opposition to the right (see above in liberal) no specific conservative party was founded in Portugal; conservatives acted inside the CDS-PP and the PSD. Frequently linked with the neoliberals, pure conservatives are rare in the party as the usual partisan or politician of the party is economically moderate, but socially conservative. One of the rare exceptions of a pure conservative in this party was former party member and MP Vasco Pulido Valente, who is highly elitist and a cultural (unlike most of the party&#x27;s partisans, who have various degrees of populism or meritocracy), highly conservative and traditionalist.
Mostly former communists and leftists who supported the policies of the Bush administration and defend similar views in Portuguese politics. The main example is José Pacheco Pereira (though his support of the Bush doctrine on the invasion of Iraq is sometimes challenged. They are frequently referred to as &quot;Cavaco-ists&quot; due to their support of cavacoism&#x27;s legacy and candidates representative of it, like Cavaco Silva himself and Ferreira Leite, defending the position that they should take a hard stance on the left and its social liberalism).
Neoliberal tendencies were introduced in Portuguese economy by Cavaco Silva, removing socialism from the constitution and finishing the de-collectivization of the economy started with Sá Carneiro. Cavaco (a self-described neo-Keynesian) never employed a totally Reaganite or Thatcherite strategy, maintaining a social democrat matrix and many (right and left-wing) populist and neo-Keynesian policies. Alberto João Jardim described the inconsistent neoliberalism of the PSD as &quot;those Chicago Boys have some funny ideas, but when election time arrives the old Keynesianism is still what counts&quot;. Cavaco Silva and Durão Barroso are both sometimes referred to as the closest to neo-liberal leaders of the party. The main pure representative of the streak is Manuela Ferreira Leite, but even she called herself a social democrat and explained &quot;I&#x27;m not certainly liberal, I&#x27;m also not populist&quot; and lead the social democratic factions during internal party rifts, though she accepts the nickname &quot;Portuguese iron lady&quot; and comparisons to Thatcher if &quot;[it] means [...] an enormous intransigence on values and in principles, of not abdicating from these values and from these principles and of continuing my way independently of the popularity of my actions and the effects on my image&quot;. The main group (officially non-partisan) associated with the neoliberal faction of the PSD is the (Lighthouse Project).
The average PSD voter and partisan since Cavaco Silva&#x27;s leadership. Cavaco himself, though a self-described Neo-Keynesian, an early member of the party since its centre-left days and a man with social-liberal and centrist populist economic policy tendencies, he is personally a social conservative (opposing same-sex marriage and abortion) and a practicing Catholic. As such, Cavacoism should be considered a &quot;hybrid&quot; or a political syncretism. A similar case is Vasco Graça Moura, who claims to be an economic social democrat but opposes gay people serving in the military and is a self-described &quot;centre-left reactionary&quot;. The overlappers are mainly represented in the forums gathered by the District of Oporto section of the party, which during the 2009 European elections tried to gather the ideas of all factions.
Not to be confused with overlappers. Still indecisive between (traditional or Portuguese) social democracy, social liberalism or any other kind of centrism.
Are pragmatic although open to privatization and civil society alternatives to the social state, in speech they move closer to the centre-left origins of the party and are generally proud of them. The main representative of this faction is Pedro Passos Coelho, who claims to be neither left nor right, but that &quot;the real issues are between old and new&quot;, though his opponents identified him as a liberal (in the conservative-liberal or neoliberal European sense) since the 2008 party election, though he recalled the many meanings of liberal and recalled the left liberalism of the United States Democratic Party, being even called &quot;PSD&#x27;s Obama&quot; by supporters. Centrists and transversalists inside the party share the think tank (Building Ideas), which Passos Coelho founded and leads. They mix (like the closely allied centrists) calls to privatization with others to more social justice, government regulation and arbitration and strategic governmental involvement in the economy. This faction is in constant rift with the more socially right-wing ones (who have been leading the party for a long time) and also with the overlappers whose hybrid approach they refuse, over the future of the party and its future ideological and philosophical alignments.

<text>Tabular Data Stream (TDS) is an application layer protocol used to transfer data between a database server and a client. It was initially designed and developed by Sybase Inc. for their Sybase SQL Server relational database engine in 1984, and later by Microsoft in Microsoft SQL Server.

==History==
During the early development of Sybase SQL Server, the developers at Sybase perceived the lack of a commonly accepted application level protocol to transfer data between a database server and its client. In order to encourage the use of its products, Sybase promoted the use of a flexible pair of libraries, called codice_1 and codice_2, to implement standard SQL. A further library was included in order to implement &quot;Bulk Copy&quot; called codice_3. While codice_1&#x27;s job is to ferry data between the two computers through the underlying network protocol, codice_2 provides an API to the client program, and communicates with the server via codice_1. codice_2 sends to the server a structured stream of bytes meant for tables of data, hence a Tabular Data Stream. codice_3 provides, like codice_2, an API to the client programs and communicates with the server via codice_1.

In 1990 Sybase entered into a technology-sharing agreement with Microsoft which resulted in Microsoft marketing its own SQL Server — Microsoft SQL Server — based on Sybase&#x27;s code. Microsoft kept the codice_2 API and added ODBC. (Microsoft has since added additional APIs.) At about the same time, Sybase introduced a more powerful successor to codice_2, called codice_13, and called the pair Open Client. codice_2, though officially deprecated, remains in widespread use.

The TDS protocol comes in several varieties, most of which had not been openly documented because they were regarded as proprietary technology. The exception was TDS 5.0, used exclusively by Sybase, for which documentation is available from Sybase. This situation changed when Microsoft published the TDS specification in 2008, as part of the Open Specification Promise.

The FreeTDS team has developed a free native-library implementation of the TDS protocol, licensed under the LGPL license. WireShark has a protocol decoder for TDS.

Oracle Corporation provides Oracle Net - software analogous to TDS.

<doc id="404854" wikidata="Q1260986" url="?curid=404854" title="Hydrostatic test">
<text>A hydrostatic test is a way in which pressure vessels such as pipelines, plumbing, gas cylinders, boilers and fuel tanks can be tested for strength and leaks. The test involves filling the vessel or pipe system with a liquid, usually water, which may be dyed to aid in visual leak detection, and pressurization of the vessel to the specified test pressure. Pressure tightness can be tested by shutting off the supply valve and observing whether there is a pressure loss. The location of a leak can be visually identified more easily if the water contains a colorant. Strength is usually tested by measuring permanent deformation of the container.

Hydrostatic testing is the most common method employed for testing pipes and pressure vessels. Using this test helps maintain safety standards and durability of a vessel over time. Newly manufactured pieces are initially qualified using the hydrostatic test. They are then revalidated at regular intervals according to the relevant standard. In some cases where a hydrostatic test is not practicable a pneumatic pressure test may be an acceptable alternative.

Testing of pressure vessels for transport and storage of gases is very important because such containers can explode if they fail under pressure.

== Testing procedures ==
Hydrostatic tests are conducted under the constraints of either the industry&#x27;s or the customer&#x27;s specifications, or may be required by law. The vessel is filled with a nearly incompressible liquid – usually water or oil – pressurised to test pressure, and examined for leaks or permanent changes in shape. Red or fluorescent dyes may be added to the water to make leaks easier to see. The test pressure is always considerably higher than the operating pressure to give a factor of safety. This factor of safety is typically 166.66%, 143% or 150% of the designed working pressure, depending on the regulations that apply. For example, if a cylinder was rated to DOT-2015 PSI (approximately 139 bar), it would be tested at around 3360 PSI (approximately 232 bar).

Water is commonly used because it is cheap and easily available, and is usually harmless to the system to be tested. Hydraulic fluids and oils may be specified where contamination with water could cause problems. These fluids are nearly incompressible, therefore requiring relatively little work to develop a high pressure, and is therefore also only able to release a small amount of energy in case of a failure - only a small volume will escape under high pressure if the container fails. If high pressure gas were used, then the gas would expand to V=(nRT)/p with its compressed volume resulting in an explosion, with the attendant risk of damage or injury.
Small pressure vessels are normally tested using a water jacket test. The vessel is visually examined for defects and then placed in a container filled with water, and in which the change in volume of the vessel can be measured, usually by monitoring the water level in a calibrated tube. The vessel is then pressurised for a specified period, usually 30 or more seconds, and if specified, the expansion will be measured by reading off the amount of liquid that has been forced into the measuring tube by the volume increase of the pressurised vessel. The vessel is then depressurised, and the permanent volume increase due to plastic deformation while under pressure () is measured by comparing the final volume in the measuring tube with the volume before pressurisation.

A leak will give a similar result to permanent set, but will be detectable by holding the volume in the pressurised vessel by closing the inlet valve for a period before depressurising, as the pressure will drop steadily during this period if there is a leak. In most cases a permanent set that exceeds the specified maximum will indicate failure. A leak may also be a failure criterion, but it may be that the leak is due to poor sealing of the test equipment. If the vessel fails, it will normally go through a condemning process marking the cylinder as unsafe.

The information needed to specify the test is stamped onto the cylinder. This includes the design standard, serial number, manufacturer, and manufacture date. After testing, the vessel or its nameplate will usually be stamp marked with the date of the successful test, and the test facility&#x27;s identification mark.

A simpler test, that is also considered a hydrostatic test but can be performed by anyone who has a garden hose, is to pressurise the vessel by filling it with water and to physically examine the outside for leaks. This type of test is suitable for containers such as boat fuel tanks, which are not pressure vessels but must work under the hydrostatic pressure of the contents. A hydrostatic test head is usually specified as a height above the tank top. The tank is pressurised by filling water to the specified height through a temporary standpipe if necessary. It may be necessary to seal vents and other outlets during the test.

== Examples ==
Portable fire extinguishers are safety tools that are required in most public buildings. Fire extinguishers are also recommended in homes. Over time the conditions in which they are housed, and the manner in which they are handled affect the structural integrity of the extinguisher. A structurally weakened fire extinguisher can malfunction or even burst when it is needed the most. To maintain the quality and safety of this product, hydrostatic testing is utilized. All critical components of the fire extinguisher should be tested to ensure proper function.

==Pipeline testing==
Hydrotesting of pipes, pipelines and vessels is performed to expose defective materials that have missed prior detection, ensure that any remaining defects are insignificant enough to allow operation at design pressures, expose possible leaks and serve as a final validation of the integrity of the constructed system. ASME B31.3 requires this testing to ensure tightness and strength.

Buried high pressure oil and gas pipelines are tested for strength by pressurising them to at least 125% of their maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) at any point along their length. Since many long distance transmission pipelines are designed to have a steel hoop stress of 80% of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) at Maximum allowable operating pressure MAOP, this means that the steel is stressed to SMYS and above during the testing, and test sections must be selected to ensure that excessive plastic deformation does not occur.

For piping built to ASME B31.3, if the design temperature is greater than the test temperature, then the test pressure must be adjusted for the related allowable stress at the design temperature. This is done by multiplying 1.5 MAWP by the ratio of the allowable stress at the test temperature to allowable stress at the design temperature per ASME B31.3 Section 345.4.2 Equation 24. Test pressures need not exceed a value that would produce a stress higher than yield stress at test temperature. ASME B31.3 section 345.4.2 (c)

Other codes require a more onerous approach. BS PD 8010-2 requires testing to 150% of the &quot;design&quot; pressure – which should not be less than the MAOP plus surge and other incidental effects that will occur during normal operation.

Leak testing is performed by balancing changes in the measured pressure in the test section against the theoretical pressure changes calculated from changes in the measured temperature of the test section.

Australian standard AS2885.5 &quot;Pipelines – Gas and liquid petroleum: Part 5: Field pressure testing&quot; gives an excellent explanation of the factors involved.

In the aerospace industry, depending on the airline, company or customer, certain codes will need to be followed. For example, Bell Helicopter has a certain specification that will have to be followed for any parts that will be used in their helicopters.

== Testing frequency ==
Most countries have legislation or pressure vessel codes which requires vessels to be regularly tested, for example every two years (with a visual inspection annually) for high pressure gas cylinders and every five or ten years for lower pressure ones such as used in fire extinguishers. Gas cylinders which fail are normally destroyed as part of the testing protocol to avoid the dangers inherent in them being subsequently used.

These common US standard gas cylinders have the following requirements:

* DOT-3AL gas cylinders must be tested every 5 years and have an unlimited life.
* DOT-3HT gas cylinders must be tested every 3 years and have a 24-year life.
* DOT-3AA gas cylinders must be tested every 5 years and have an unlimited life. (Unless stamped with a star (*) in which case the cylinder meets certain specifications and can have a 10-year hydrostatic test life).

Typically organizations such as DOT PHMSA, ISO, ASTM and ASME specify the guidelines for the different types of pressure vessels.

==Safety==
Hydraulic testing is a hazardous process and should be performed with caution by competent personnel. Adhering to prescribed procedures defined in relevant technical standards appropriate to the specific application and jurisdiction will usually reduce these risks to an acceptable level.
* A leak of high pressure liquid can cut or penetrate the skin and inject itself into body tissues. This can cause serious direct injury to the operator, and if the fluid is toxic or contaminated there will be additional adverse effects. 
* A pressurised hose that is not securely attached or which fails under pressure may whip around spraying water or oil and could hit someone and cause injuries. A can be used to restrain such hoses. 
* Enclosing the components to be tested, hazard signage, use of appropriate personal protective equipment and providing barriers to access for non-essential personnel are common precautions.

Equipment:
* Pressure gauges
* Water supply
* Pumps and hoses for water filling 
* High pressure pump and hoses for pressurising
* Means of measuring volumetric expansion when applicable

<doc id="404857" wikidata="Q6532368" url="?curid=404857" title="Let's Get Small">
<text>Let&#x27;s Get Small (1977) is an album by American comedian Steve Martin. It includes &quot;Excuse Me&quot;, a comedy bit whose title went on to become a national catchphrase. The album went platinum and peaked at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums Chart.

It was recorded at The Boarding House in San Francisco, California.

This album won the Grammy Award in 1978 for Best Comedy Album.

Some of Martin&#x27;s bits were dependent on visual demonstration, such as when he dances as a Vegas pop singer on the track &quot;Las Vegas&quot; (presumably recognizing this in the context of recording the album, Martin&#x27;s shoes are audible and quite loud as he performs the dance on this track) and also during the &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Small&quot; track where he discusses getting small while driving — here he mimed driving a car while being so short as to barely reach the bottom of the steering wheel. Martin had debuted this particular bit in a February 26, 1977 appearance on the show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

The album cover shows Martin wearing balloon animals, bunny ears, Groucho Marx glasses, and a fake arrow through his head; these were all staples of his live act. He made balloon animals on some of his &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearances as well as his guest appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, while the fake arrow through the head was spoofed by Dinah Shore for a guest appearance by Martin on her talk show.

==Legacy==
The phrase &quot;well, excuuuuuuse me&quot; has entered the vernacular due to a bit featured on this album. The bit was cited as an inspiration for &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; character Link, who uses &quot;Well, excuse me, Princess!&quot; as a catchphrase in the 1989 cartoon.

<doc id="404861" wikidata="Q1281480" url="?curid=404861" title="Awami League">
<text>Bangladesh Awami League, simply known as Awami League, is one of the major political parties in Bangladesh. The oldest existing political party in the country, the party played the leading role in achieving the independence of Bangladesh. It is also one of the two most dominant parties in the country, along with its archrival, Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

In 1949, the party was founded as the East Pakistan Awami Muslim League (after 1955, the East Pakistan Awami League) by Bengali nationalists, Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, Yar Mohammad Khan and Shamsul Huq, and joined later by Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy who went on to become Prime Minister of Pakistan. It was established as the socialist Bengali alternative to the domination of the Muslim League in Pakistan and over centralisation of the government. The party quickly gained a massive popular support in East Bengal (later named East Pakistan) and eventually led the forces of Bengali nationalism in the struggle against West Pakistan&#x27;s military and political establishment. The party under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, led the struggle for independence, first through massive populist and civil disobedience movements, such as the Six point movement and Non-cooperation movement (1971), and then during the Bangladesh War of Independence.

After the emergence of independent Bangladesh, Awami League under the leadership of Sheikh Mujib won the first general elections. The party along with other left-wing political parties of Bangladesh were merged into Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BaKSAL) in January 1975, where Awami League politicians played the leading role in BaKSAL. After the August 1975 coup, the party was made onto the political sidelines, and many of its senior leaders and activists were executed or jailed. In 1981, Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Sheikh Mujib, became the president of the party and continued to hold the position to this date.

The party played a crucial role in the anti-authoritarian movements against the regime of Hussain Muhammad Ershad. After the restoration of democracy amidst mass uprising in 1990, the Awami League emerged as one of the principal players of Bangladeshi politics. The party formed governments winning the 1996, 2008, 2014, 2018 and 2024 general elections. Throughout its tenure as the ruling party from 2009 to 2024 under Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh experienced significant democratic backsliding and was consistently described as authoritarian, dictatorial and fascist. It was finally overthrown with the Student–People&#x27;s uprising in August 2024. Since then, the party remained underground.

Sheikh Hasina, the former prime minister of Bangladesh, and Obaidul Quader, currently have been serving the president and the general secretary of the party, respectively. Sheikh Hasina, has headed the party since 1981. Amongst the leaders of the Awami League, five have become the President of Bangladesh, four have become the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and one became the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

==Name and symbols==

East Pakistan Awami Muslim League was formed as a breakaway faction of the Muslim League in 1949, within two years of the formation of Pakistan. The word &quot;Muslim&quot; was dropped in 1953 and it became a secular party. The word &quot;Awami&quot; is the adjectival form for the Urdu word &quot;Awam&quot;, which means &quot;people&quot;; thus the party&#x27;s name can be translated as Bangladesh People&#x27;s League. During the Bangladesh War of Independence of 1971, most Awami League members joined the Provisional Government of Bangladesh and Mukti Bahini to fight against the Pakistan army and the name &quot;Bangladesh Awami League&quot; was eventually settled upon.

The most common electoral symbol for the party has been a traditional boat, a recognizable and relatable image in riverine Bangladesh.

The salutation &quot;Joy Bangla&quot; (; meaning &quot;Victory to Bengal&quot; or &quot;Long live Bengal&quot;) is the official slogan of the Awami League. It was the slogan and war cry of the Mukti Bahini that fought for the independence of Bangladesh during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The phrase &quot;Joy Bangla, Joy Bangabandhu&quot; is used by the party members at the end of speeches and communications pertaining to or referring to the devotion towards Bangladesh and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib.

The Awami League party flag is a green field with four five-rayed red star at its centre, and a vertical red stripe at the hoist side. The flag also bears some resemblance to the flag of Pakistan, showing the ex-Pakistani origin of the Awami League. The four stars on the Flag represent the four fundamental principles of the party.

==History==
===Founding and early Pakistan era (1949–66)===

During the post-Mughal era, no political parties existed in the area known as Bangla or Bangal. After the British arrived and established government, the system of political representation (though much later) was adopted in the area of Bangla (Bengal) or introduced in Bengal. After the official departure of the British, the area known as East Bengal became a part of Pakistan, and the establishment of the Muslim was led by its founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his Muslim League party.

In 1948, there was rising agitation in East Bengal against the omission of Bengali script from coins, stamps and government exams. Thousands of students, mainly from the University of Dhaka, protested in Dhaka and clashed with security forces. Prominent student leaders including Shamsul Huq, Khaleque Nawaz Khan, Shawkat Ali, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, and Abdul Wahed were arrested and the police were accused of repression while charging protesters. In March, senior Bengali political leaders were attacked whilst leading protests demanding that Bengali be declared an official language in Pakistan. The leaders included A. K. Fazlul Huq, the former Prime Minister of undivided Bengal. Amidst the rising discontent in East Bengal, Jinnah visited Dhaka and announced that Urdu would be the sole state language of Pakistan given its significance to Islamic nationalism in South Asia. The announcement caused an emotional uproar in East Bengal, where the native Bengali population resented Jinnah for his attempts to impose a language they hardly understood on the basis of upholding unity. The resentment was further fuelled by rising discrimination against Bengalis in government, industry, bureaucracy and the armed forces and the dominance of the Muslim League. The Bengalis argued that they constituted the ethnic majority of Pakistan&#x27;s population and Urdu was unknown to the majority in East Bengal. Moreover, the rich literary heritage of the Bengali language and the deep rooted secular culture of Bengali society led to a strong sense of linguistic and cultural nationalism amongst the people of East Bengal. The only significant language in Pakistan not written in the Persian-Arabic script was Bengali. Against this backdrop, Bengali nationalism began to take root within the Muslim League and the party&#x27;s Bengali members began to take a stand for recognition.

On 23 June 1949, Bengali nationalists from East Bengal broke away from the Muslim League, Pakistan&#x27;s dominant political party, and established the East Pakistan Awami Muslim League. Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Shamsul Huq were elected the first president and general secretary of the party respectively, Ataur Rahman Khan was elected the vice-president, Yar Mohammad Khan was elected as the treasurer, while Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad and A. K. Rafiqul Hussain were elected the party&#x27;s first joint secretaries. The party was formed to champion the rights of the masses in Pakistan against the powerful feudal establishment led by the Muslim League. However, due to its strength stemming from the discriminated Bengali population of Pakistan&#x27;s eastern wing, the party eventually became associated and identified with East Bengal.
In 1952, the Awami Muslim League and its student wing played an instrumental role in the Bengali Language Movement, during which Pakistani security forces fired upon protesting students demanding Bengali be declared an official language of Pakistan, killing a number of students including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar. The events of 1952 are widely seen by historians today as a turning point in the history of Pakistan and the Bengali people, as it was the starting point of the Bengali nationalist struggle that eventually culminated in the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.
Hussein Shaheed Suhrawardy, who had been the All-India Muslim League (AIML)-nominated prime minister of Bengal in 1937 and held the same office after 1946 elections, did not agree to &#x27;Muslim League&#x27; as the name of AIML in Pakistan. He initiated the thought that the ideal of political representation under religious identity was no longer prudent after independence and the organisation might be called the &#x27;Pakistan League&#x27;. Moreover, he claimed that the Muslim League&#x27;s objective of struggling to form a nation state had been achieved therefore political representation should continue focusing on nationalism based on Pakistani sovereignty. Suhrawardy&#x27;s suggestion was not accepted and he parted ways with the party to be re-established as the Awami League in 1949. This was to serve the first shock to the country&#x27;s political structure. In 1953, the party&#x27;s council meeting voted to drop the word &quot;Muslim&quot;. In the run-up to the 1954 East Bengal Legislative Assembly election, the Awami League took the lead in negotiations in forming a pan-Bangla political alliance including the Krishak Praja Party, Nizam-e-Islam and Ganatantri Dal. The alliance was termed the Jukta Front (United Front) and formulated the &quot;Ekush Dafa&quot;, or 21-point Charter, to fight for establishing rights in East Pakistan. The party also took the historic decision to adopt the traditional Bengali boat, which signified the attachment to rural Bengal, as its election symbol.

The election in April 1954 swept the United Front coalition into power in East Bengal with a massive mandate of 223 seats out of 237 seats. The Awami League itself won 143 seats while the Muslim League won only 9 seats. Veteran student leader and language movement stalwart Khaleque Nawaz Khan defeated incumbent prime minister of the then East Bengali Nurul Amin in a landslide margin. Amin was defeated in his home Nandail constituency. Khaleque Nawaz Khan created history at age 27 by defeating the sitting prime minister and the Muslim League was wiped from the political landscape of the then East Pakistan. A. K. Fazlul Huq assumed the office of Chief Minister of East Bengal and drew up a cabinet containing many of the prominent student activists that were leading movements against the Pakistani state. They included Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Awami League, who served as commerce minister.

Leaders of the new provincial government demanded greater provincial autonomy for East Bengal and eventually succeeded in pressuring Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra, himself a Bengali, to endorse the proposed constitutional recognition of Bengali as an official language of Pakistan. The United Front also passed a landmark order for the establishment of the Bangla Academy in Dhaka.
As tensions with the western wing grew due to the demands for greater provincial autonomy in East Bengal, Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad dismissed the United Front government on 29 May 1954 under Article 92/A of the provisional constitution of Pakistan.

In September 1956, the Awami League formed a coalition with the Republican Party to secure a majority in the new National Assembly of Pakistan and took over the central government. Awami League President Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy became the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Suhrawardy pursued a reform agenda to reduce the long-standing economic disparity between East and West Pakistan, greater representation of Bengalis in the Pakistani civil and armed services and he unsuccessfully attempted to alleviate the food shortage in the country.

The Awami League also began deepening relations with the United States. The government moved to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO), the two strategic defence alliances in Asia inspired by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Maulana Bhashani, one of the party&#x27;s founders, condemned the decision of the Suhrawardy government and called a conference in February 1957 at Kagmari, Tangail in East Bengal. He protested the move and the support lent by the Awami League leadership to the government. Bhashani broke away from the Awami League and then formed the leftist National Awami Party (NAP).
Yar Mohammad Khan funded the 5-day Kagmari Conference and was the treasurer of the conference committee.

The controversy over &#x27;One Unit&#x27; (the division of Pakistan into only two provinces, east and west) and the appropriate electoral system for Pakistan, whether joint or separate, also revived as soon as Suhrawardy became prime minister. In West Pakistan, there was strong opposition to the joint electorate by the Muslim League and the religious parties. The Awami League however, strongly supported the joint electorate. These differences over One Unit and the appropriate electorate caused problems for the government.

By early 1957, the movement for the dismemberment of the One Unit had started. Suhrawardy was at the mercy of the central bureaucracy fighting to save the One Unit. Many in the business elite in Karachi were lobbying against Suhrawardy&#x27;s decision to distribute millions of dollars of American aid to East Pakistan and to set up a national shipping corporation. Supported by these lobbyists, President Iskander Mirza demanded the Prime Minister&#x27;s resignation. Suhrawardy requested to seek a vote of confidence in the National Assembly, but this request was turned down. Suhrawardy resigned under threat of dismissal on 10 October 1957.

On 7 October 1958, President Mirza declared martial law and appointed army chief General Ayub Khan as Chief Martial Law Administrator. Khan eventually deposed Mirza in a bloodless coup. By promulgating the Political Parties Elected Bodies Disqualified Ordinance, Khan banned all major political parties in Pakistan. Senior politicians, including the entire top leadership of the Awami League, were arrested and most were kept under detention until 1963.

In 1962, Khan drafted a new constitution, modelled on indirect election, through an electoral college, and termed it &#x27;Basic Democracy&#x27;. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy joined Nurul Amin, Khwaja Nazimuddin, Maulvi Farid Ahmed and Hamidul Haq Chowdhury in forming the National Democratic Front against Ayub Khan&#x27;s military-backed rule and to restore elective democracy. However the alliance failed to obtain any concessions. Instead the electoral colleges appointed a new parliament and the President exercised executive authority.

Widespread discrimination prevailed in Pakistan against Bengalis during the regime of Khan. The University of Dhaka became a hotbed for student activism advocating greater rights for Bengalis and the restoration of democracy in Pakistan.

On 5 December 1963, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy was found dead in his hotel room in Beirut, Lebanon. His sudden death under mysterious circumstances gave rise to speculation within the Awami League and the general population in East Pakistan that he had been poisoned.

=== Struggle for independence (1966–71) ===

The 6-point demands, proposed by Mujib, were widely accepted by the East Pakistani populace, as they proposed greater autonomy for the provinces of Pakistan. After the so-called Agartala Conspiracy Case, and subsequent end of the Ayub Khan&#x27;s regime in Pakistan, the Awami League and its leader Sheikh Mujib reached the peak of their popularity among the East Pakistani Bengali population. In the elections of 1970, the Awami League won 167 of 169 East Pakistan seats in the National Assembly but none of West Pakistan&#x27;s 138 seats. It also won 288 of the 300 provincial assembly seats in East Pakistan. This win gave the Awami League a healthy majority in the 313-seat National Assembly and placed it in a position to establish a national government without a coalition partner. This was not acceptable to the political leaders of West Pakistan and led directly to the events of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The Awami League leaders, taking refuge in India, successfully led the war against the Pakistan Army throughout 1971. Leader Sheikh Mujib was arrested by the Pakistan Army on 25 March 1971, but the Bangladeshi people continued the fight to free themselves for nine months.

=== After independence (1971—1975)===
After victory on 16 December 1971, the party formed the national government of Bangladesh. In 1972, under Sheikh Mujib, the party name was changed to &quot;Awami League&quot;. The new government faced many challenges as they rebuilt the country and carried out mine clearing operations. The party had pro Pakistani newspaper editors arrested and shut down the nations&#x27; newspapers leaving only four in operation. Food shortages were also a major concern of the Awami League. War had damaged all forms of farming. The party aligned itself with the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and leaned towards the Soviet bloc. The party was accused of corruption by supporters of Pakistan. In 1974 Bangladesh suffered a famine: 70,000 people died, and support for Mujib declined. Bangladesh continued exporting jute to Cuba, violating US economic sanctions, the Nixon government barred grain imports to Bangladesh. This exacerbated famine conditions.

In January 1975, facing violent leftist insurgents Mujib declared a state of emergency and later assumed the presidency, after the Awami League dominated parliament decided to switch from parliamentary to a presidential form of government. Sheikh Mujib renamed the League the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL), and banned all other parties. The consequences lead to a critical political state. BAKSAL was dissolved after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

The move towards a secular form of government caused widespread dissatisfaction among many low ranking military personnel, most of whom received training from the Pakistani army. On 15 August 1975 during the time of Major General K. M. Shafiullah as a Chief of the Army Staff, some junior members of the armed forces in Dhaka, led by Major Faruk Rahman and Major Rashid, murdered Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and all his family members, including his wife and minor son. Within months, on 3 November 1975, four more of its top leaders, Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, Muhammad Mansur Ali and A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman were killed inside the Dhaka Central Jail as they were on behalf of BAKSAL. Only Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, daughters of Mujib, survived the 1988 Chittagong Massacre as they were in West Germany as a part of a cultural exchange program. They later claimed political asylum in the United Kingdom. Sheikh Rehana, the younger sister, chose to remain in the UK permanently, while Sheikh Hasina moved to India and lived in self-imposed exile. Her stays abroad helped her gain important political friends in the West and in India that proved to be a valuable asset for the party in the future.

===Struggle for democracy (1981–2009)===

After 1975, the party remained split into several rival factions and fared poorly in the 1979 parliamentary elections held under a military government. In 1981 Sheikh Hasina returned as Ziaur Rahman allowed her to return after the largest party faction, the Awami League elected her its president, and she proceeded to take over the party leadership and unite the factions. As she was under age at the time she could not take part in the 1981 presidential elections that followed the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman. Throughout the following nine years of military rule by Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad the Awami League participated in some polls but boycotted most as Ershad did not believe in democracy. On 7 May 1986, Awami League participated in the general election of Bangladesh staged by military ruler Lt. Gen. H. M. Ershad even though the other major political party and the winner of previous elections Bangladesh Nationalist Party boycotted. British observers including a journalists termed the elections a &quot;tragedy for democracy&quot; and a &quot;cynically frustrated exercise&quot;.

The Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party in parliament in the elections in 1991, in which Khaleda Zia became the first female prime minister.

AL&#x27;s second term in office had mixed achievements. Apart from sustaining economic stability during the Asian economic crisis, the government successfully settled Bangladesh&#x27;s long standing dispute with India over sharing the water of the river Ganges (also known as Padma) in late 1996, and signed a peace treaty with tribal rebels in 1997. In 1998, Bangladesh faced one of the worst floods ever, and the government handled the crisis satisfactorily. It also had significant achievements in containing inflation, and peacefully neutralising a long-running leftist insurgency in south-western districts dating back to the first AL government&#x27;s time. However, rampant corruption allegations against party office bearers and ministers as well as a deteriorating law and order situation troubled the government. Its pro poor policies achieved wide microeconomic development but that left the country&#x27;s wealthy business class dissatisfied. The AL&#x27;s last months in office were marred by sporadic bombing by alleged Islamist militants. Hasina herself escaped several attempts on her life, in one of which two anti-tank mines were planted under her helipad in Gopalganj district. In July 2001, the second AL government stepped down, becoming the first elected government in Bangladesh to serve a full term in office.

The party won only 62 out of 300 parliamentary seats in the elections held in October 2001, despite winning 40% of the votes, up from 36% in 1996 and 33% in 1991. The BNP and its allies won a two-thirds majority in parliament with 46% of the votes cast, with BNP alone winning 41%, up from 33% in 1996 and 30% in 1991.

In its second term in opposition since 1991, the party suffered the assassination of several key members. Popular young leader Ahsanullah Master, a member of parliament from Gazipur, was killed in 2004. This was followed by a grenade attack on Hasina during a public meeting on 21 August 2004, resulting in the death of 22 party supporters, including party women&#x27;s secretary Ivy Rahman, though Hasina lived. Finally, the party&#x27;s electoral secretary, ex finance minister, and veteran diplomat Shah M S Kibria, a member of parliament from Habiganj, was killed in a grenade attack in Sylhet later that year.

In June 2005, the Awami League won an important victory when the AL nominated incumbent mayor A.B.M. Mohiuddin Chowdhury won the important mayoral election in Chittagong, by a huge margin, against BNP nominee State Minister of Aviation Mir Mohammad Nasiruddin. This election was seen as a showdown between the Awami League and the BNP. However, the killing of party leaders continued. In December 2005, the AL supported Mayor of Sylhet narrowly escaped the third attempt on his life as a grenade thrown at him failed to explode.

In September 2006, several of the party&#x27;s top leaders, including Saber Hossain Chowdhury MP and Asaduzzaman Nur MP, were hospitalised after being critically injured by police beatings while they demonstrated in support of electoral-law reforms. Starting in late October 2006, the Awami League led alliance carried out a series of nationwide demonstrations and blockades centring on the selection of the leader of the interim caretaker administration to oversee the 2007 elections. Although an election was scheduled to take place on 22 January 2007 that the Awami League decided to boycott, the country&#x27;s military intervened on 11 January 2007 and installed an interim government composed of retired bureaucrats and military officers.

Throughout 2007 and 2008, the military backed government tried to root out corruption and remove Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia of the AL and BNP respectively. While these efforts largely failed, they succeeded in producing a credible voter list that was used on 29 December 2008 national election.

The Awami League won the national election held on 29 December 2008 as part of a larger electoral alliance that also included the Jatiya Party led by former military ruler Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad as well as some leftist parties. According to the Official Results, Bangladesh Awami League won 230 out of 300 constituencies, and together with its allies, had a total of 262 parliamentary seats. The Awami League and its allies received 57% of the total votes cast. The AL alone got 48%, compared to 36% of the other major alliance led by the BNP which by itself got 33% of the votes. Sheikh Hasina, as party head, became the new prime minister. Her term of office began in January 2009. The second Hasina cabinet had several new faces, including three women in prominent positions: Dr Dipu Moni (Foreign Minister), Matia Chowdhury (Agriculture Minister) and Sahara Khatun (Home Minister). Younger MPs with a link to assassinated members of the 1972–1975 AL government were Sayed Ashraful Islam, son of Syed Nazrul Islam, Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, son of Sheikh Fazlul Huq Moni, and Sohel Taj, son of Tajuddin Ahmad.

=== Second Hasina Government (2009—2024) ===

Since 2009, the Awami League government faced several major political challenges, including BDR (Bangladesh Rifles) mutiny, power crisis, unrest in garments industry and stock market fluctuations. Judicial achievements for the party included restoring original 1972 constitution, returning secularism to the constitution, beginning of war crimes trials, and guilty verdict in 1975 assassination trial. According to the Nielsen 2-year survey, 50% felt the country was moving in the right direction, and 36% gave the government a favourable rating.

In the 2014 election the Awami League led alliance won a second term of which 154 Members (out of 300) of Parliament were selected where there were no election . Only 5% voter attended in the polling station and cast their votes. The opposition and one of the most popular parties (BNP) boycotted the election for removing the caretaker government (neutral government) system from the constitution after completion of 5 years tenure. With 21 people dead due to the violence during election, along with further human rights abuses and an absence of opposition, this was one of the controversial general elections in Bangladesh&#x27;s history. This election was further tainted by arrests where dozens of opposition leaders and members were taken into custody.

Amid this crackdown of opposition, in 2018, another election was held where BNP and all major opposition parties took part. That election was marred by allegations of widespread electoral fraud, harassment of political opposition and imprisonment of opposition activists. The opposition alleged the complicity of law enforcement forces in compromising the integrity of the electoral process.

On 7 January 2024, the twelfth National Parliamentary elections were held which were boycotted by BNP and major opposition parties. Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) condemned this process as one-sided and farcical. The election saw Awami League again clinching a landslide victory, winning 224 out of 300 directly elected seats. The 62 elected members who contested the election as independents largely aligned with AL.

On 5 June 2024, The High Court of Bangladesh reinstated the controversial Job Quota System, sparking countrywide students protests. On 4 July 2024, The Appellate Division refused to rescind the verdict. As a result, protests intensified. Then the Appellate Division imposed a stay on the ruling but protesters continued to carry on their movement unless the government agreed to their demands of taking a firm step for reforming the quota system. Prime Minister Hasina ignited controversy by her statement:

Protesters were further galvanized at this comment. Bangladesh Students&#x27; League, aided by the Police and other agencies, violently cracked down on the protesters. In spite of that crackdown, the protests could not be quelled. The government imposed internet shutdown as well as curfews to forcefully stop the momentum of the movement. Eventually, the protests morphed into a movement aimed at ensuring the resignation of Sheikh Hasina. On 5 August 2024, millions of protesters defied curfew orders and marched towards Ganobhaban. Consequently, Hasina resigned and left Bangladesh for India. This ended 15 years of continuous awami rule in Bangladesh.

=== Post-government (2024—present) ===

In the immediate aftermath of the fall of the AL government, many of its leaders went into hiding. The properties and residences of many AL leaders were looted, vandalized and set on fire. Many ministers and influential politicians from AL have been arrested and taken into remand. Many of them were prohibited from leaving Bangladesh. The bank accounts of many AL leaders and their families have also been frozen.

The student wing of Bangladesh Awami League has been officially banned by the Government of Bangladesh from all types of political and organizational activities and declared as a terrorist organization on 23 Oct 2024.

==Ideology and policies==
The party has been labelled as centrist and centre-left, however, it has also been accused of being far-right and authoritarian since 2021. Awami League has been described as secular (though this is disputed), social democratic, social-liberal, and economically liberal, with a historical, though still influential, ideological base combining left-wing nationalism, socialism, and democratic socialism. The party&#x27;s nationalist outlook is primarily concentrated in its fundamental principles and historical role of nationalism in the Independence War.

The ideology of Awami League has been evolved through political and socio-economic landscape of the country since its creation. The Party President Sheikh Hasina claimed that her party&#x27;s ideology has been blended with pragmatism. Party&#x27;s constitution states four fundamental principles in guiding its philosophy and policies: democracy, socialism, secularism and nationalism. The origins of these principles can be traced to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&#x27;s political thought.

===Secularism===

Awami League has been committed to secularism for a long time. The party has promoted a strong secular image and depicted itself as a defender of secularism against Islamism. Most of the party leaders support the restoration of the original constitution of 1972 by removing Islam as the state religion. Since Islam has been made as the state religion of Bangladesh, Awami League has been trying to defended secularism in light of Islam. Being a pragmatist party, Awami League often compromises with the Islamist political parties in social issues, which has been criticized. The party&#x27;s tolerance of the Islamic practices, retaining of Islam as the state religion, silence during the attacks on secularists in Bangladesh, has been questioned.

Sheikh Hasina supported calls to remove the Statue of Justice in Bangladesh Supreme Court. Many criticized these calls, saying Sheikh Hasina was bowing down to the pressure of Islamist political hard-liners.

According to a report by &quot;Al Jazeera&quot;, a significant number of Hindus think that they weren&#x27;t safe under Awami League rule as many anti-Hindu violences occurred and the ruling party members were involved in the harassment of Hindus. According to Sreeradha Datta, professor and Bangladesh expert at Jindal School of International Affairs in New Delhi, India, noted about Awami League&#x27;s secularism: 

===Economy===

Previously the party advocated for a socialist economy with democratic socialism. Inspiring from Soviet and Indian economic models, Awami League under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman implemented an economic system based on strict protectionism, state intervention and economic regulation under a planned economy and limited market activities, which was characterized as &quot;neither capitalist nor socialist&quot; in nature. During the 1980s, AL began to reposition itself towards more centre-left. Many ideologues strongly objected of this policy shift in the party. Nevertheless, in 1992, AL formally took a liberal economic approach. Since the 2010s, AL government has been very pro-market &quot;which focused on boosting exports, attracting foreign investment, improving infrastructure, diversifying the economy, and enhancing the business environment.&quot;

Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s views on socialism has changed over times. In 1991, she noted that socialism was a failed system. However, in 2024, she said that &quot;fulfilling the people&#x27;s basic needs&quot; had been her &quot;version of &#x27;socialism&#x27;&quot;.

===Social position===
The party has taken a sightly conservative position on social issues and promotion of Islam, including the establishment of Islamic Foundation Bangladesh, declaration of public holidays in the Islamic festivals and, more recently, the construction of 360 Model Mosques across the country. The party&#x27;s position on the LGBT rights is also conservative, the AL-lead Parliament refused to overturn Section 377, in 2009 and 2013. It was reported in 2017 that the party in government has been cracking down on the LGBT community. This has included the arrests of those accused of being homosexual.

===Vision 2021 and Vision 2041===

Before the 2008 general elections in Bangladesh, the Awami League announced in its manifesto, its &quot;Vision 2021&quot; and &quot;Digital Bangladesh&quot; action plans to transform Bangladesh into a fast-developing middle-income country by 2021. The policy was criticized as a policy emblematic of technological optimism in the context of Bangladesh and the state repression of media, low internet penetration, inadequate electricity generation. Prior to the 2024 Bangladeshi general election, Awami League announced Smart Bangladesh initiative associated with the Bangladesh Vision 2041 framework in its manifesto, a national strategic plan aiming to further develop the socio-economic standings of Bangladesh by transforming the country into a technologically advanced and sustainable society with low income inequality and high standard of living.

===Environmentalism===
In 2011, Awami League government passed the 15th amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh wherein Article 18A was added which endeavours to protect and improve environment. Awami League under Sheikh Hasina also promised to protect the country&#x27;s environment in its manifesto for the 2024 election. Her government also adopted the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, an &quot;adaptation-based technical and economic master plan, which has considered the effects of water resources management, land use, environment, and climate change, and its interaction on the development results&quot;. Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s government has been praised for combating natural calamities, greening her country and promoting international consciousness regarding climate change.

===Foreign policy===
During the premiership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman between 1972 and 1975, Rahman&#x27;s personal influence in the country&#x27;s foreign policy was instrumental. Rahman himself wanted to make his country as the Switzerland of Asia. His government was successful in obtaining recognition from the major countries of the world before 15 August 1975, although the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Saudi Arabia recognized Bangladesh just after 15 August.

Awami League is often described as pro-India. &quot;Bangladesh has enjoyed a good relationship with India under PM Sheikh Hasina&quot;. After Awami League formed government under Hasina in 1996, her government adopted an India-oriented foreign policy. This continued since 2009, when she secured power for the second time. In 2015, Hasina signed a historic land exchange agreement with Indian PM Narendra Modi which resolved the decade-long India–Bangladesh enclaves problem.

Awami League continued good relationship with China. &quot;Hasina has adroitly balanced ties with both India and China&quot;.

Sheikh Hasina government allowed Rohingyas to take refuge in Bangladesh, for which she received credit and praise in home and abroad.

Awami League continues to support Palestinian cause. In 1972, Awami League government officially rejected the Israeli recognition of Bangladesh. In 2014, Sheikh Hasina said, &quot;We have been continuing our support to the Palestinians and occupation of their land by the Israelis is never acceptable&quot;.

==Criticism==
===Authoritarianism===
Awami League has been described as authoritarian by various national and international observers. In 2011, the AL-led government abolished the neutral non-partisan caretaker government system through passage of the 15th amendment of the constitution with its majority in Parliament, despite the protests of opposition parties, including the BNP. Since the 2014, the freedom of the press in Bangladesh has declined dramatically. Awami League government targeted and detained many leading newspapers, television channels and pro-opposition journalists. According to Ali Riaz, &quot;Awami League has established total control over state machinery and politics&quot; since 2018.
In a 2021 report Human Rights Watch said that in government the party has &quot;doubled down on an authoritarian crackdown on free speech, arresting critics, and censoring media.&quot; This followed a prior violent crackdown on those that criticised the party in 2018. The general elections of 2014 and 2018 was criticized by the United States and the European Union for irregularities.

===JRB atrocities===

Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini, dissolved armed wing of Awami League, formed under the supervision of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and active from 1972 to 1975, became involved in numerous charges of political killings, shooting by death squads, and rape. Human Rights Watch states that institutionalized violence committed by the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini, established the culture of impunity and widespread prevalence of abuses by security forces in independent Bangladesh.

===Promotion of &quot;political nationalism&quot;===
Awami League has been accused for promoting &quot;political nationalism&quot;, a form of radical nationalism. This form of nationalism emphasizes on &quot;exclusion based on political identity&quot; over other factors, although it is &quot;more inclined to accept religious diversity, cultural differences, and racial diversity within a state, but cannot accept political differences in ideology or party support&quot;. The party always styles itself as the &quot;proliberation force&quot; and positions itself as the &quot;sole custodian&quot; of the spirit of Liberation War, while diminishing the opposition&#x27;s contributions to the Liberation War; which has been described as an attempt to delegitimize the opposition in the context of electoral politics. Critiques argue that this type of self-proclaimed interpretation of Bangladesh Liberation War results in an illiberal socio-political landscape in the country that marginalizes the opposition.

<text>The is an railway line in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, connecting Hakata Station in Fukuoka with Hakataminami Station in Kasuga. It is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).

==Service==
Although the line uses Shinkansen equipment, trains are officially designated as limited express trains. In practice, however, most services are extensions of San&#x27;yō Shinkansen &quot;Kodama&quot; services. The Kyushu Shinkansen, opened on 12 March 2011, shares part of the route.

The trip from Hakata to Hakataminami takes ten minutes and costs ¥300.

* 700-7000 series 8-car &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; sets
* N700-7000/8000 series 8-car sets

==History==
The line was originally opened in March 1975 to transport San&#x27;yō Shinkansen trains from the Hakata terminal to Hakata Depot in Kasuga. At that time, Kasuga was a rural region and did not merit a railway station of its own. By the late 1980s, however, the area had become a sprawling suburb of Fukuoka. JR decided to build a station adjacent to the depot, and inaugurated service on 1 April 1990 with 0 Series Shinkansen trains.

<text>Berthold Auerbach (28 February 1812 – 8 February 1882) was a German poet and author. He was the founder of the German &quot;tendency novel&quot;, in which fiction is used as a means of influencing public opinion on social, political, moral, and religious questions.

== Biography ==
Moses (Moyses) Baruch Auerbach was born in Nordstetten (now Horb am Neckar) in the Kingdom of Württemberg. He attended Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium. He was intended for the ministry, but after studying philosophy at Tübingen, Munich and Heidelberg, and becoming estranged from Jewish orthodoxy by the study of Spinoza, he devoted himself to literature. While a student in Heidelberg and under the pseudonym “Theobald Chauber,” he produced a &quot;Biography of Frederick the Great&quot; (1834–36).

Another early publication was entitled &quot;Das Judentum und die neueste Litteratur&quot; (Judaism and Recent Literature; 1836), and was to be followed by a series of novels taken from Jewish history. Of this intended series he actually published, with considerable success, &quot;Spinoza&quot; (1837) and &quot;Dichter und Kaufmann&quot; (&quot;Poet and Merchant&quot;; 1839), based on the life of Ephraim Kuh. His romance on the life of Spinoza adheres so closely to fact that it may be read with equal advantage as a novel or as a biography. In 1841, he created a translation of Spinoza&#x27;s works. In 1842, he wrote &quot;Der gebildete Bürger&quot; (&quot;The Educated Citizen&quot;), an attempt to popularize philosophical subjects.

But real fame and popularity came to him after 1843, when he began to occupy himself with the life of the common people which forms the subject of his best-known works. That year he published &quot;Schwarzwälder Dorfgeschichten&quot; (&quot;Black Forest Village Stories&quot;; 1843) which was his first great success, widely translated, and expressing with a sympathetic realism the memories and scenes of youth. 

In 1857, he paid tribute to the beloved German author and professor of philosophy Christian F. Gellert in his story &quot;Gellerts letzte Weihnachten&quot; published in Deutscher Familienkalendar (The German Family Almanac). Its English translation was first published in 1869 as &quot;Christian Gellert&#x27;s Last Christmas.&quot; It was included in The 10 volume anthology Stories by Foreign Authors (German Volume 2) first published by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons in 1898. 

It is the first story in the volume, which includes a frontispiece portrait of Auerbach. The story illustrates the far-reaching impact of the beloved professor&#x27;s writings on his fellow citizens. It opens with Gellert and the rustic woodcutter Christopher reflecting on how their work takes a toll on their painfully aging bodies, pondering what alternative career might have been more fulfilling. Christopher&#x27;s attitude is transformed when he reads Gellert&#x27;s verse in his children&#x27;s school book, which is lying open on his breakfast table. The lines

&quot;Accept God&#x27;s gifts with resignation, 
 Content to lack what thou hast not:
 In every lot there&#x27;s consolation; 
 There&#x27;s trouble, too, in every lot!&quot;

These words inspire Christopher to donate the load of wood he intended to sell at the marketplace in Leipzig to Gellert, when his wife tells him the professor lives there in penury. When the two men meet, each is able to affirm the appreciation of his own life through knowing the other, thus affirming the power of Gellert&#x27;s positive influence on the German people, especially the &quot;common folk.&quot;

In his later books, of which &quot;Auf der Höhe&quot; (On the Heights; 1865) is perhaps the most characteristic, and certainly the most famous, he revealed an unrivaled insight into the soul of the southern German country folk, and especially of the peasants of the Black Forest and the Bavarian Alps. His descriptions are remarkable for their fresh realism, graceful style and humour. In addition to these qualities, his last books are marked by great subtlety of psychological analysis. &quot;Auf der Höhe&quot; was first published at Stuttgart in 1861, and has been translated into several languages.
Auerbach died at Cannes shortly before his 70th birthday.

<doc id="404875" wikidata="Q1680388" url="?curid=404875" title="James FitzGibbon">
<text>James FitzGibbon (16 November 1780 – 10 December 1863) was a public servant, prominent freemason of the masonic lodge from 1822 to 1826 (holding the highest position in Upper Canada of deputy provincial grand master), member of the Family Compact, and an Irish soldier in the British Army in Europe before and in the Canadas during the War of 1812 who received messages of warning from two Canadian folk heroes: Laura Secord (Ingersoll) and Billy Green.

James held many titles with Upper Canadian society after the War of 1812, and before the Rebellions of 1837-1838 would be considered a prominent Canadian Tory and a &quot;prime example of government patronage&quot; by William Lyon Mackenzie.

It is noted that the Rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada brought out &quot;the peak of FitzGibbon&#x27;s career&quot; and he would be made the acting adjutant-general of militia in Upper Canada, but FitzGibbon would retire the day after the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern, citing &quot;Head&#x27;s treatment&quot;. This &quot;treatment&quot; was likely Head&#x27;s preferential choosing of Allan MacNab over FitzGibbon first in leading the attack on Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern.

FitzGibbon would argue in a pamphlet called &quot;An appeal to the people of the late province of Upper Canada&quot; submitted to the British government in 1847 that he and his actions had &quot;saved Upper Canada for the Empire&quot; during the Rebellions of 1837–1838, but nothing came from it.

FitzGibbon&#x27;s biography notes him essentially as having been an extremely effective man in his career who was cheated of any real reward beyond recognition. FitzGibbon was &quot;intensely loyal (to the crown) and had a keen mind, but lacked the formal education, wealth, and social background that would have enabled him to penetrate the ranks of office in the army or government&quot;. Nevertheless, FitzGibbon is still noted as being &quot;a conscientious, capable, and zealous public servant until he became overburdened with debt and grew obsessed by the injustice of the long delay in granting him his well-earned reward&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Born to Garrett (Gerald) FitzGibbon and Mary Widenham in Glin, County Limerick, Ireland, he enlisted in the Knight of Glin&#x27;s Yeomanry Corps at age 15. Three years later, he joined the Tarbert Infantry Fencibles, an Irish home service regiment, from which he was recruited into the British Army&#x27;s 49th Regiment of Foot as a private soldier. He first fought in battle in 1799 at Egmond aan Zee, the Netherlands. He later served as a marine in the Battle of Copenhagen, for which he received the Naval General Service Medal.

==Arrival in Canada==
He went to the Canadas in 1802, by which time he was a sergeant. He apparently played a key role in the suppression of a near-mutiny at Fort George, Upper Canada, but there is no mention of this in his official biography.

In 1806, when he was the regiment&#x27;s sergeant-major, his commanding officer, Isaac Brock, made him an officer. This was extremely unusual at the time as most officers&#x27; commissions were bought. Later the same year he was appointed regimental adjutant. In 1809, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant.

==War of 1812==

The &quot;main body&quot; of FitzGibbon&#x27;s enlisted regiment - the 49th Regiment of Foot (though without its modern renaming) - were present during the Battle of Fort George, at the Fort itself. However, it appears that FitzGibbon was not, as there is a notable lack of evidence within FitzGibbon&#x27;s official biography of any presence or action of James; it is likely that if a figure held in such high historical esteem as FitzGibbon was present at the battle, this information would be readily available.

In August 1812, FitzGibbon escorted a brigade of ships holding military stores from Montreal to Kingston, going through &quot;the rapids&quot; (the &quot;International Rapids&quot;) of the St. Lawrence River, while in view of the American shore.

In January 1813, FitzGibbon led 45 sleighs holding needed supplies from Kingston to Niagara through the Canadian winter.

FitzGibbon fought at the Battle of Stoney Creek on 6 June 1813. Three weeks later, he led 50 soldiers in guerrilla-style raids on a large American force that had captured Fort George on the Niagara Peninsula. It was he who was warned by Laura Secord on 22 June about an impending surprise attack by 500 American troops. This led to the Battle of Beaver Dams near present-day Thorold, Ontario, where FitzGibbon&#x27;s force, together with about 400 Mohawk and Odawa warriors, defeated the Americans and took 462 prisoners. The victory made FitzGibbon a popular hero and he was promoted to captain in the Glengarry Light Infantry Fencibles.

After the Battle of Beaver Dams, FitzGibbon would operate almost exclusively in reconnaissance and observing the movement of the American troops.

In 1814 he fought at the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane but his part was not effective. FitzGibbon and his Glengarry Light Infantry Fencibles were attacking the left flank of the opposing American forces when both he and his troops were mistaken as American soldiers themselves by regular troops under the command of Lieutenant-General Gordon Drummond, who subsequently fired on them. FitzGibbon and his force, in consequence of this friendly-fire, were forced to withdraw. However, as argued by American historian John R. Elting, the strategy that FitzGibbon was using (in seeking to attack the weakened left flank) against the Americans would likely have been successful in achieving a divisive victory for Drummond if Drummond has concentrated the majority of his troops on the left flank itself.

After FitzGibbon&#x27;s involvement in the Battle of Beaver Dams, a local legend was created (perhaps by Mohawk Chief John Norton who was present at the time, perhaps by William Hamilton Merritt) and lamented through a piece of prose: &quot;The Caughnawaga (Norton&#x27;s troops, aka the Kahnawake) got the victory, the Mohawks got the plunder and FitzGibbon got the credit&quot;. This was also the battle wherein FitzGibbon would receive warning from Laura Secord (Ingersoll).

==Post-war activities==

After the war, FitzGibbon retired on half-pay and became a clerk in the office of the Adjutant-General of the militia. He was later promoted to Assistant Adjutant-General.

FitzGibbon married his one and only wife, Mary Haley, in 1814. They would have five children together - four sons and one daughter - with the daughter &quot;living beyond infancy&quot;.

In 1818, FitzGibbon responded to accusations from Robert Fleming Gourlay that he thought Canadians were disloyal and ungrateful subjects. In 1824 the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada Peregrine Maitland sent FitzGibbon to negotiate an end to riots in the Bathurst District of York between Irish settlers and previous residents. A year later newspapers in Upper Canada questioned the loyalty of Irish immigrants and FitzGibbon wrote editorials defending the immigrants.

From 1822 to 1826, FitzGibbon held the position of highest-ranking member of the Masonic lodge in Upper Canada as deputy provincial grand master. The next position up - provincial grand master - would have to be retained in England.

In 1826, FitzGibbon initiated a campaign to help the defendants of the Types Riot pay their settlement to Mackenzie. Mackenzie would claim that FitzGibbon&#x27;s appointment as clerk of the House of Assembly came as reward for this action, and would select FitzGibbon as &quot;a prime example of government patronage&quot;. He denied accusations by Francis Collins in the &quot;Canadian Freeman&quot; that Maitland contributed to the fund but did not deny his involvement or contributions from other government administrators.

During the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837, FitzGibbon was appointed Acting Adjutant-General of Militia. He organised and led the forces that defended Toronto from William Lyon Mackenzie&#x27;s rebel force.

FitzGibbon would suffer a mental breakdown before the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern as he had to equip and form about 1200 volunteers the next morning, and had no experience organizing troops for battle. FitzGibbon would retire to his office, fall on his knees in prayer, and accomplish his task following restored post-prayer composure. The battle was won and both the physical building of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern and the home of a rebel named David Gibson were burned to the ground.

The day after the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern, FitzGibbon would resign as acting adjutant general of the Upper Canadian militia following Sir Francis Bond Head&#x27;s &quot;treatment&quot; to FitzGibbon - that likely being Head&#x27;s decision to first have MacNab lead the troops over FitzGibbon. Note that FitzGibbon would be the one to lead the troops after &quot;vigorous protesting&quot; to Head.

FitzGibbon was a founding member of the York Mechanics&#x27; Institute in 1831.

The Bank of Upper Canada would threaten to sue FitzGibbon for money borrowed to pay off creditors, but the threat was never carried out.

==Later life and legacy==
In May 1838, the citizens of Toronto held a public meeting and expressed gratitude in FitzGibbon for &quot;rescuing them from the horrors of a civil war&quot;. They would propose a gift in his honour in the form of a money donation, but this money never materialized.

In 1842 he left Toronto and lived on Seaton (now Arch) Street in Kingston.

After various proposals, ignored appeals, and rejections for giving a monetary gift to FitzGibbon, finally a sum of 1000 British pounds would be given to him - but this amount was only half the total of FitzGibbon&#x27;s debts.

FitzGibbon&#x27;s physician - Dr. William Winder - said of him in 1845 that his character essentially flipped: &quot;FitzGibbon was temperament, highly sanguine and nervous&quot; which along with &quot;disappointments and distresses of no ordinary character&quot; had come to produce &quot;a state of mental irritation, prostration, and despondency, plus loss of memory&quot; in the man.

FitzGibbon was retired on pension in 1846 following his &quot;virtual transformation of the Office into a sinecure&quot;.

He moved to England in 1847 after the death of his wife Mary Haley, with whom he had four sons and a daughter. In 1850 he was appointed a Military Knight of Windsor through the influence of Lord Seaton. There, FitzGibbon lived on a small allowance, in comfortable quarters provided by the crown, using his Canadian pension to pay off debts.

He died at Windsor Castle in 1863 and is buried there in the crypt of St. George&#x27;s Chapel.

In 2003 his descendants donated some of his personal effects, including a signet ring and a ceremonial sword, to the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa.

==In popular culture==
FitzGibbon appears in &quot;The Bully Boys&quot;, a novel by Eric Walters. The book follows his interactions with fictional character Thomas Roberts, whom he takes under his wing during the events surrounding the Battle of Beaver Dams.

<text>President of Bangladesh (POB), officially the President of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh, is the head of state of Bangladesh and commander-in-chief of the Bangladesh Armed Forces.

The role of the president has changed three times since Bangladesh achieved its independence in 1971. Presidents had been given executive power. In 1991, with the restoration of a democratically elected government, Bangladesh adopted a parliamentary democracy based on a Westminster system. The President is now a largely ceremonial post, elected by the Parliament.

In 1996, Parliament passed new laws enhancing the president&#x27;s executive authority, as laid down in the constitution, after the Parliament is dissolved. The president resides at the Bangabhaban, which is his office and residence. The president is elected by the 350 parliamentarians in an open ballot, and thus generally represents the majority party of the legislature. He continues to hold office after his five-year term expires until a successor is elected to the presidency.

Mohammed Shahabuddin is the current president; he was elected unopposed on 13 February 2023. He took office for a five-year term on Monday, 24 April 2023.

== Powers and duties ==

Currently, although the position of president holds &quot;de jure&quot; importance, its &quot;de facto&quot; powers are largely ceremonial. The Constitution allows the president to act only upon the advice of the prime minister and his/her Cabinet.

=== Appointments powers ===

The president can appoint the following to office:
* By Article 56 (2), the prime minister and his/her Cabinet, with the limitation that the prime minister must be a parliamentarian who holds the confidence of the majority of the House. The president can also dismiss a member of Cabinet upon the request of the prime minister.
* By Article 95, the chief justice and other judges of the court.
* By Article 118, the Bangladesh Election Commission, including the chief.

=== Prerogative of mercy ===

The president has the prerogative of mercy by Article 49 of the Constitution, which allows him to grant a pardon to anybody, overriding any court verdict in Bangladesh.

===Legislative powers===

By Article 80, the president can refuse to assent to any bill passed by the parliament, sending it back for review. A bill is enacted only after the president assents to it. But when the bill is passed again by the parliament, if the president further fails or refuse to assent a bill, after a certain period of days, the bill will be automatically transformed into law and will be considered as assented by the president.

=== Chancellor at universities ===
Chancellor is a titular position at universities in Bangladesh, always held by the incumbent president of Bangladesh under the Private Universities Act 1992. The position in public universities is not fixed for the president under any acts or laws (since the erection of a state university in Bangladesh requires an act to be passed in itself), but it has been the custom so far to name the incumbent president of the country as chancellor of all state universities thus established.

== Selection process ==

=== Eligibility ===
The Constitution of Bangladesh sets the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the president.
A person shall not be qualified for election as president if he-
* is less than thirty-five years of age; or
* is not qualified for election a member of Parliament; or
* has been removed from the office of president by impeachment under the Constitution.

=== Conditions for presidency ===
Certain conditions, as per Article 27 of the Constitution, debar any eligible citizen from contesting the presidential elections.
The conditions are:
* No person shall hold office as president for more than two terms, whether or not the terms are consecutive.
* The president shall not be a member of Parliament, and if a member of Parliament is elected as president, he shall vacate his seat in Parliament on the day on which he enters upon his office as president.

=== Election process ===
Whenever the office becomes vacant, the new president is chosen by members of Parliament. Although presidential elections involve actual voting by MPs, they tend to vote for the candidate supported by their respective parties. The president may be impeached and subsequently removed from office by a two-thirds majority vote of the parliament.

=== Oath or affirmation ===
The president is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the Speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad, an oath or affirmation that he/she shall protect, preserve and defend the Constitution as follows:

== Immunity ==

The president is granted immunity for all his actions by Article 51 of the Constitution and is not answerable to anybody for his actions, and no criminal charges can be brought to the Court against him. The only exception to this immunity is if the Parliament seeks to impeach the President.

== Succession ==
Article 54 of the Constitution of Bangladesh provides for the succession of the president. It states that in case of absence due to illness or other reasons, the speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad will act as the president of Bangladesh until the president resumes office. This Article was used during the ascension of Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar as the acting president of the state following the resignation of former president A. Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury, and when President Zillur Rahman could not discharge his duties due to his illness, and later, death.

Since Bangladesh is a parliamentary system, it does not have a vice-president. However, during the presidential system of governance, Bangladesh had a vice-president who would assume the president&#x27;s role in his absence; the post was abolished by the twelfth amendment to the Constitution in 1991.

== Removal ==

A president can resign from office by writing a letter by hand to the speaker. The president can also be impeached by the Parliament. In case of impeachment, the Parliament must bring specific charges against the president, and investigate it themselves, or refer it to any other body for investigation. The president will have the right to defend himself. Following the proceedings, the president is impeached immediately if two-thirds of the Parliament votes in favour, and the speaker ascends to power.

== Presidential residences and office ==

The principal presidential residence at Bangabhaban is located in Dhaka. There is also a presidential Palace at Uttara Ganabhaban in Natore District.

== History of the office ==
===Independence war and parliamentary republic (1971–75) ===
At the beginning of the Bangladesh war of independence in April 1971, the Bangladesh Forces, better known as the &quot;Mukti Bahini&quot;, and the Provisional Government of Bangladesh, popularly called the &quot;Mujibnagar Government&quot;, were both established. After the oath ceremony held at Meherpur, Kushtia following Yahya Khan&#x27;s anti-secessionist military operation in Dhaka, the latter government-in-exile (GiE) set up its headquarters at 8 Theatre Road, in Kolkata, India.

====Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Awami League)====

The de jure president of the GiE and thus the first president of Bangladesh was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was the most popular leader of the independence struggle imprisoned shortly after the independence declaration, with vice-president and acting president being Syed Nazrul Islam and Tajuddin Ahmad as prime minister. As the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh, which was formed out of the East Pakistani elected members of the 1970 Pakistani general election, convened a month after the war on 12 January 1972, he introduced parliamentarism through a presidential decree and left office for the role of prime minister. In December on the first anniversary of the end of the war, the new constitution of the country took effect founding a unitary parliamentary republic based on the British Westminster System and transferring all executive powers to the prime minister.

Later, after the general election in 1973 where Mujib&#x27;s party the Awami League achieved an expected landslide victory overkilling the opposition (not only because of intimidation of candidates and ballot stuffing by the ruling party leaders), in January 1974, the first presidential election was held. Mohammad Mohammadullah, who replaced Mujib&#x27;s successor Abu Sayeed Chowdhury as acting president upon the latter&#x27;s resignation, was indirectly elected uncontested and sworn in as the ceremonial head of state.

Mujib is widely considered the founder of Bangladesh and deemed as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; of the country. He is popularly referred with the honorary title of &quot;Bangabandhu&quot; (বঙ্গবন্ধু &quot;Friend of Bengal&quot;). He introduced the state policy of Bangladesh according to four basic principles: nationalism, secularism, democracy and socialism. He nationalized hundreds of industries and companies as well as abandoned land and capital and initiated land reform aimed at helping millions of poor farmers. Major efforts were launched to rehabilitate an estimated 10 million refugees. He further outlined state programs to expand primary education, sanitation, food, healthcare, water and electric supply across the country. A five-year plan released in 1973 focused state investments into agriculture, rural infrastructure and cottage industries.

After Bangladesh achieved recognition from most countries, Mujib helped Bangladesh enter into the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement. He travelled to the United States, the United Kingdom and other European nations to obtain humanitarian and developmental assistance for the nation. He signed a treaty of friendship with India, which pledged extensive economic and humanitarian assistance and began training Bangladesh&#x27;s security forces and government personnel.

Mujib&#x27;s premiership however faced serious challenges, which included the rehabilitation of millions of people displaced in 1971, organizing the supply of food, health aids and other necessities. The effects of the 1970 cyclone had not worn off, and the state&#x27;s economy had immensely deteriorated by the conflict. Economically, Mujib&#x27;s huge nationalization program and socialist planning caused the economy to suffer. By the end of the year, thousands of Bengalis arrived from Pakistan, and thousands of non-Bengalis migrated to Pakistan; and yet many thousands remained in refugee camps. Mujib forged a close friendship with Indira Gandhi, strongly praising India&#x27;s decision to intercede, and professed admiration and friendship for India. In the aftermath of the 1974 Famine, there was growing dissatisfaction with his government.

=== Presidential system and autocratic one-party state (1975) ===
Irked by the heavy criticism from the opposition and news outlets and worried about the Awami League&#x27;s prospects in the next election, on 28 December 1974 Mujib declared a state of emergency. The following month, he openly advocated to the view that parliamentarism has failed in the country and had the lawmakers amend the constitution to revive the presidential system in order to better manage emergencies in the country. After assuming the presidency again, Mujib criticized &quot;free-style&quot; liberal democracy and established an autocratic one-party state with the strongly socialist Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League as the national party and him as the unelected president and unopposed supreme leader for life. He banned all other political parties and activities while sharply curtailing freedom of speech and the press.

However, these changes were remarked as the &quot;Second Revolution&quot; by Mujib. In bringing together all politicians under a single national party apparently for the sake of unity of the country during a critical period it struck a similarity to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s National Union Party during the height of the American Civil War. The new party obliged all members of parliament, government and semi-autonomous associations and bodies to join, as well as intimidated and violently punished or eliminated opposition to the regime using the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini, the paramilitary &quot;national defence force&quot; and the ruling party&#x27;s armed wing.

=== Military juntas and democratic presidencies (1975–1991) ===

Soon after, some close associates of Mujibur Rahman, who were ministers and secretaries, joined an assassination plot by the Bangladesh Army. On 15 August 1975, Mujib was assassinated in a coup d&#x27;état by some mid-ranking army officers, and replaced by one of his long time associates and cabinet members who was in a bitter bureaucratic rivalry with his loyalists, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. Immediately after, martial law was promulgated in the country.

As soon as he assumed presidency, along with replacing the national slogan of &quot;Joy Bangla&quot; (&quot;Hail Bengal&quot;), a cry of Bengali nationalism with &quot;Bangladesh Zindabad&quot; (&quot;Love Live Bangladesh&quot;) calling for Bangladeshi nationalism instead, Mostaq replaced all three armed forces chiefs with next in line seniors to likely ensure the lack of Mujib loyalists in the military. He also proclaimed the Indemnity Ordinance, which granted immunity from prosecution to the assassins of Mujib. Yet only a few months later on 3 November, his regime faced a bloodless coup by pro-Mujib officers led by Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf in an attempt to depose Mostaq and the military assassins backing his government. At night, presumably on Mostaq&#x27;s orders, some army officers secretly carried out the killing of the imprisoned Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, Abul Hasnat Muhammad Qamaruzzaman and Mujib&#x27;s new PM Muhammad Mansur Ali. With the ousting of Mostaq three days later and the constitutional requirement for the direct election of the president and role of the vice-president as acting president suspended by Mostaq, Chief Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem was appointed to the presidency of what became a military interim government. However, the next day a popular uprising led by the retired lieutenant colonel Abu Taher ended in yet another coup with the deaths of several military generals, including Mosharraf. With Mosharraf dead, the office of Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) was taken by Sayem. Sayem dissolved the parliament and scheduled a general election in February 1977 in a presidential speech addressed to the nation but indefinitely postponed it in November 1976. Mostaq Ahmad was sentenced for five years for corruption and abuse of power.

Ziaur Rahman (Bangladesh Nationalist Party)

Major General Ziaur Rahman, a renowned war hero who was put under house arrest on alleged charges of participation in the Mujib assassination plot (probably due to being among Mostaq&#x27;s promoted armed forces chiefs), emerged into the political scene when restored to the post of Chief of Army Staff following the uprising. With the country in a dire situation and no stability and security, he was promoted from one of Sayem&#x27;s deputies to CMLA in November 1976.

With Zia&#x27;s military loyalists now running the state from behind, initially as Deputy CMLA (DCMLA) he sought to invigorate government policy and administration. Hence on 21 April 1977, when Sayem retired on health grounds, without a vice-president Zia assumed acting presidency. The presidency was legitimized 40 days later through a national confidence referendum. Finally in the presidential election the following year, Zia became the first directly elected president. His government removed the remaining restrictions on political parties and encouraged all opposition parties to participate in the pending general election while putting military generals into politics. More than 30 parties vied in the 1979 general election, and with massive public support, Zia&#x27;s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) achieved a single-party majority. After the election in February, the withdrawal of martial law was proclaimed on 6 April and the 2nd parliament was formed 9 days later.

Drifting away from the Secular State and Liberal Nationalism

Zia moved to lead the nation in a new direction, significantly different from the ideology and agenda of the 1st parliament of Bangladesh. He issued a proclamation order amending the constitution, replacing secularism with increasing the faith of the people in their creator, following the same tactics that was used in Pakistan during the Ayub Khan regime to establish a military rule over civilian democratic rule in the government system. In the preamble, he inserted the salutation &quot;Bismillahir-Rahmaanir-Rahim&quot; (&quot;In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful&quot;). In Article 8(1) and 8(1A) the statement &quot;absolute trust and faith in Almighty Allah&quot; was added, replacing the commitment to secularism. Socialism was redefined as &quot;economic and social justice.&quot; In Article 25(2), Zia introduced the principle that &quot;the state shall endeavour to consolidate, preserve and strengthen fraternal relations among Muslim countries based on Islamic solidarity.&quot; Zia&#x27;s edits to the constitution redefined the nature of the republic from the secularism laid out by Sheikh Mujib and his supporters. Islamic religious education was introduced as a compulsory subject in Bangladeshi schools, with provisions for non-Muslim students to learn of their own religions.

In public speeches and policies that he formulated, Zia began expounding &quot;Bangladeshi nationalism,&quot; as opposed to Mujib&#x27;s assertion of a Liberal Nationalism that emphasised on the liberation of Bengalis from Pakistan&#x27;s autocratic regime. Zia emphasised the national role of Islam (as practised by the majority of Bangladeshis). Claiming to promote an inclusive national identity, Zia reached out to non-Bengali minorities such as the Santals, Garos, Manipuris and Chakmas, as well as the Urdu-speaking peoples of Bihari origin. However, many of these groups were predominantly Hindu and Buddhist and were alienated by Zia&#x27;s promotion of political Islam. In an effort to promote cultural assimilation and economic development, Zia appointed a Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Commission in 1976, but resisted holding a political dialogue with the representatives of the hill tribes on the issue of autonomy and cultural self-preservation. On 2 July 1977 Ziaur Rahman organised a tribal convention to promote a dialogue between the government and tribal groups. However, most cultural and political issues would remain unresolved and intermittent incidents of inter-community violence and militancy occurred throughout Zia&#x27;s rule.

Reforms and international relations

Notable mentions of Ziaur Rahman&#x27;s tenure as a president have been radical reforms both in country&#x27;s infrastructure and diplomacy. President Zia successfully pointed out the grounds those could be effectively and exclusively decisive for development of Bangladesh and his reforms covered the political, economical, agricultural and military infrastructure of Bangladesh. Reorganisation of Bangladesh&#x27;s international relations are especially mentionable because it had active influence over both economy and politics. He successfully bailed Bangladesh out of the Indo-Soviet bloc and grabbed the distancing strings to put bar on the gradually deterioration of Bangladeshi relations with the Western world. Zia gave attention to the other Eastern superpower China that later helped Bangladesh hugely to recover from economical setbacks and to enrich the arsenal of her armed forces.

The most notable of Zia&#x27;s reformed diplomacy was establishing a relationship with the Muslim world as well as the Middle East. The present bulk overseas recruitment of Bangladeshi migrant workers to Middle Eastern countries are direct outcome of Zia&#x27;s efforts those he put to develop a long-lasting relationship with the Muslim leadership of the world. The purpose of Middle East relations has been largely economical whereas the rapid improvement of relations with China was particularly made to for rapid advancement of the country&#x27;s armed forces.

Throughout the study of Zia&#x27;s international relations it could have been suggested that attention to the bigger neighbour India has been largely ignored. But Zia was found to put strong emphasis on regional co-operation particularly for South Asia. It came evident after Zia took initiative to found SAARC. Zia&#x27;s dream of Bangladesh&#x27;s involvement in a strong regional co-operation was met after 4 years of his assassination when SAARC got founded on 8 December 1985 with a key role of the then Bangladeshi authority.

Assassination of Ziaur Rahman
In 1981, Zia was assassinated by fractions of the military who were dissatisfied with his non-conventional means of running many state affairs including the military. Vice-President Justice Abdus Sattar was constitutionally sworn in as acting president. He declared a new national emergency and called for elections within 6 months. Sattar was elected president and won. Sattar was ineffective, however, and Army Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. H.M. Ershad assumed power in a bloodless coup in March 1982.

Hussain Muhammad Ershad (Jatiya Party)

Like his predecessors, Ershad dissolved parliament, declared martial law, assumed the position of CMLA, suspended the constitution, and banned political activity. Ershad reaffirmed Bangladesh&#x27;s moderate, non-aligned foreign policy.

In December 1983, he assumed the presidency. Over the ensuing months, Ershad sought a formula for elections while dealing with potential threats to public order.

On 1 January 1986, full political rights, including the right to hold large public rallies, were restored. At the same time, the Jatiyo (People&#x27;s) Party (JP), designed as Ershad&#x27;s political vehicle for the transition from martial law, was established. Ershad resigned as chief of army staff, retired from military service, and was elected president in October 1986. (Both the BNP and the AL refused to put up an opposing candidate.)

In July 1987, the opposition parties united for the first time in opposition to government policies. Ershad declared a state of emergency in November, dissolved parliament in December, and scheduled new parliamentary elections for March 1988.

All major opposition parties refused to participate. Ershad&#x27;s party won 251 of the 300 seats; three other political parties which did participate, as well as a number of independent candidates, shared the remaining seats. This parliament passed a large number of legislative bills, including a controversial amendment making Islam the state religion.

By mid-1990, opposition to Ershad&#x27;s rule had escalated. November and December 1990 were marked by general strikes, increased campus protests, public rallies, and a general disintegration of law and order. Ershad resigned in December 1990. Following his resignation an interim government was formed with Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed as acting president. He conducted a general election in February 1991, in which the BNP led by Ziaur Rahman&#x27;s widow Khaleda Zia won the largest number of seats though 11 short of a majority, and a constitutional referendum in September, which put into effect the constitutional amendment to restore the parliamentary system and transfer all executive power from the president back to the prime minister.

=== Restoration of Parliamentary system (1991—present) ===
It was reverted to democratic parliamentary system in 1991 when Khaleda Zia became the first female prime minister of Bangladesh through parliamentary election.

The president is the head of state, a largely ceremonial post elected by the parliament. However, the president&#x27;s powers have been substantially expanded during the tenure of a caretaker government, which is responsible for the conduct of elections and transfer of power. The officers of the caretaker government must be non-partisan and are given three months to complete their task. This transitional arrangement is an innovation that was pioneered by Bangladesh in its 1991 election and then institutionalised in 1996 through its 13th constitutional amendment.

In the caretaker government, the president has the power to control over the Ministry of Defence, the authority to declare a state of emergency, and the power to dismiss the chief adviser and other members of the caretaker government. Once elections have been held and a new government and Parliament are in place, the president&#x27;s powers and position revert to their largely ceremonial role. The chief adviser and other advisers to the caretaker government must be appointed within 15 days after the current Parliament expires.

<text>Faustin-Élie Soulouque (; 15 August 1782 – 3 August 1867) was a Haitian politician and military commander who served as President of Haiti from 1847 to 1849 and Emperor of Haiti from 1849 to 1859.

Soulouque was a general in the Haitian Army when he was appointed President of Haiti. He acquired autocratic powers, purged the army of the ruling elite, installed black loyalists in administrative positions and the nobility, and created a secret police and private army. Soulouque was an enthusiastic &quot;vodouisant&quot;, maintaining a staff of bokors and manbos, and gave the stigmatized vodou religion semi-official status which was openly practiced in Port-au-Prince. Soulouque declared the Second Empire of Haiti in 1849 after being proclaimed Emperor under the name Faustin I, and formally crowned in 1852. Several unsuccessful attempts to reconquer the Dominican Republic eroded his support and he abdicated in 1859 under pressure from General Fabre Geffrard and Dominican military victory. Soulouque was temporarily exiled to Jamaica before returning to Haiti where he died in 1867.

Soulouque was the last Haitian head of state to have participated in the Haitian Revolution, the last to have been born prior to independence, the last ex-slave and the last to officially style himself as a king or emperor.

==Early years==

Faustin-Élie Soulouque was born on 15 August 1782 in Petit-Goâve, a small town in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, to a Haitian mother. Soulouque&#x27;s mother, Marie-Catherine Soulouque, was born in Port-au-Prince in 1744, and was a creole of ethnic Mandinka descent. Soulouque was freed as a result of a 1793 emancipation decree issued by Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, the Civil Commissioner of Saint-Domingue during the French Revolution, that abolished slavery in response to the Haitian Revolution that started in 1791.

Soulouque enlisted in the black revolutionary army in 1803 as a free citizen, as his freedom was in serious jeopardy due to attempts of the French government to re-establish slavery. Soulouque fought as a private until 1804, when the conflict ended in revolutionary victory and Saint-Domingue achieved independence as Haïti. Soulouque became a respected soldier during the conflict, and as a consequence he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Haitian Army in 1806, and made aide-de-camp to General Lamarre.

In 1810, Soulouque was appointed to the Horse Guards under President Alexandre Pétion, and for the next four decades continued to serve in the Haitian military, rising to the rank of colonel under President Philippe Guerrier. Soulouque was finally promoted to the highest command in the Haitian Army, attaining the rank of lieutenant general and Supreme Commander of the Presidential Guards under then-President Jean-Baptiste Riché.

==Reign==
In 1847, President Riché died, and during his tenure he had acted as a figurehead for the Boyerist ruling class, who immediately began to look for a replacement. Their attention quickly focused on Soulouque, whom the majority of the Boyerists considered to be a somewhat dull and ignorant man who seemed to be a malleable candidate. Soulouque, aged sixty five years-old, was subsequently enticed to accept the role offered him as Haiti&#x27;s 7th President, taking the Presidential Oath of Office on 2 March 1847.

At first Soulouque seemed to fill the role of puppet well, retaining the cabinet-level ministers of the former president and continued the programs of his predecessor. However, within a short time, Soulouque surprisingly rejected his backers and began to consolidate himself as the absolute ruler of Haiti. According to the book &quot;A Continent of Islands: Searching for the Caribbean Destiny&quot; by Mark Kurlansky: &quot;He organized a private militia, the Zinglins, and proceeded to arrest, kill, and burn out anyone who opposed him, especially mulattoes, thus consolidating his power over the government&quot;. Soulouque&#x27;s power consolidation saw an increase in racial discrimination in favor of Haiti&#x27;s black population, including a massacre of the mulattoes in Port-au-Prince on 16 April 1848. Blacks from Louisiana were invited by Soulouque to emigrate to Haiti at the country&#x27;s expense and the Haitian-educated Emile Desdunes, an Afro-Creole from New Orleans, acted as an agent for Soulouque to arrange free transportation to Haiti in 1859 for at least 350 desperate evacuees. A large number of these migrants later returned to Louisiana. Soulouque placed heavy restrictions towards all opposition, and a wave of violence used against potential rivals led to numerous murders. His open adherence to Vodou, a highly stigmatized syncretic religion, contributed to his violent reputation in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. Soulouque maintained a resident staff of manbos (high priestesses) and bokors (male witches) at his residence in Port-au-Prince.

Soulouque&#x27;s process of obtaining absolute power in Haiti culminated in the formation of the Second Empire of Haiti after the Senate and Chamber of Deputies proclaimed him Emperor of Haiti on 26 August 1849, re-establishing the Haitian empire that had been abolished in 1806 following the assassination of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who reigned as Emperor Jacques I of the First Empire of Haiti (another monarchy, the Kingdom of Haiti of Henri Christophe, existed in 1811–1820). Soulouque paid £2,000 for his crown, and spent £30,000 for the rest of the accessories (according to Sir Spenser St John, British &quot;charge d&#x27;affaires&quot; in Haiti during the 1860s in his account: &quot;Hayti, or, The Black Republic&quot;, pp. 95–96). Gustave d’Alaux describes this event in his book, &quot;Soulouque and his Empire&quot;: &quot;His Imperial Majesty had the principal merchant of Port-au-Prince called one morning and commanded him to order immediately from Paris a costume, in every particular like that he admired in representing the ceremonies of the coronation of Napoleon. Faustin I besides ordered for himself a crown, one for the Empress, a sceptre, globe, hand-of-justice, throne, and all other accessories, all to be like those used in the coronation of Napoleon.&quot;.

In December 1849, Faustin married his long-time companion Adélina Lévêque. On 18 April 1852 at Port-au-Prince, both Emperor and Empress were crowned in an immense and lavish ceremony in emulation of the coronation of Napoleon. The president of the Senate attached to the breast of the Emperor a large decoration, passed a chain about the neck of the Empress – and pronounced his address, to which His Majesty Faustin replied with spirit: &quot;Vive la liberté, vive l&#x27;égalité!” (Gustave d’Alaux). The coronation is illustrated in the &quot;Album Impérial d&#x27;Haïti&quot;, engraved by Severyn, published New York, 1852 (available in the British Library).

==Nobility==

Soulouque attempted to create a strong centralized government, which while retaining a profoundly Haitian character, borrowed heavily from European traditions, especially those of the First French Empire. One of his first acts after being declared emperor was to establish a Haitian nobility. The Constitution of 20 September 1849 granted the Emperor the right to create hereditary titles and confer other honours on his subjects. Volumes 5 and 6 of John Saunders and Westland Marston&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot; magazine (published in 1859) stated the empire consisted of 4 princes, 59 dukes, 90 earls, 30 lady knights (but no male knights), 250 barons, and 2 marchionesses. The first letters patents were issued by Soulouque on 21 December 1850. Other sources add &quot;trent cent Chevaliers&quot; and &quot;quatre cents nobles&quot; to this list. Subsequent creations extended the number of noble titles, including titles issued by King Henri Christophe of the Kingdom of Haiti were sometimes reissued by Soulouque. An example was the title of &quot;Comte du Terrier-Rouge&quot; was issued to Charles Pierre under Christophe (The Armorial of Haiti, College of Arms, London 2007, p. 78) and the same title was issued under Soulouque on behalf of General Guerrier de Prophete (Java-Bode 5 August 1857). In order that he might reward loyalty to his regime as well as add to the prestige of the Haitian monarchy, Soulouque established the Military Order of St. Faustin and the Civil Order of the Haitian Legion of Honor on 21 September 1849. Later, he created the Orders of St. Mary Magdalene and the Order of St. Anne in 1856. That same year he founded the Imperial Academy of Arts.

==Politics==
Soulouque&#x27;s foreign policy was centered on preventing foreign intrusion into Haitian politics and sovereignty. His main issue was the Dominican Republic, whose independence from Haiti in 1844 after the Dominican War of Independence ended 22-years of Haitian occupation. The Dominican Republic&#x27;s white and mulatto rulers were considered as his &quot;natural&quot; enemies and the country&#x27;s independence was, in his view, a direct threat to Haiti&#x27;s security. In 1849, Soulouque launched his first invasion of the Dominican Republic, but his army fled after 400 Dominicans put up resistance at Ocoa. A second invasion followed in 1850 which was checked by diplomatic opposition from the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. In the third and final invasion in 1855, Soulouque marched into the Dominican Republic at the head of a 30,000-man army which fled at the first shot.

Soulouque also found himself in direct confrontation with the United States over Navassa Island, which had been seized from Haiti on the somewhat dubious grounds that guano had been discovered there. Soulouque dispatched warships to the island in response to the incursion, but withdrew them after the United States guaranteed Haiti a portion of the revenues from the mining operations.

The question of who Soulouque really was is heavily disputed. Virtually no official government records of cabinet meetings exists. According to Latin American scholar Murdo J. MacLeod: &quot;We are left with his policies as they are discernible, with an assessment of the men whom he used to govern, and with our evaluation of how correct his appreciation of the situation really was. In every case we must conclude that Faustin Soulouque was a man of high intelligence, a realist, a pragmatist, and a superb, if ruthless politician and diplomat. There is no denying his patriotism and his ability to impose domestic tranquility.&quot;

===Known ministers===
* Louis Dufresne (general of the army, minister of war, the navy and foreign relations)
* Jean-Baptiste Francisque (minister of justice, worship and public education)
* Lysius Salomon (Finance, Commerce and Foreign Relations)

==Line of succession==
Soulouque&#x27;s marriage to Empress Adélina produced one daughter, Olive Soulouque. The emperor also adopted Adélina&#x27;s daughter, Olive, in 1850. She was granted the title of Princess with the style Her Serene Highness. Célita married Jean Philippe Lubin, Count of Pétion-Ville, and had issue. The emperor had one brother, Prince Jean-Joseph Soulouque, who in turn had eleven sons and daughters.

The Constitution of 20 September 1849 made the Imperial Dignity hereditary amongst the natural and legitimate direct descendants of Emperor Faustin I, by order of primogeniture and to the perpetual exclusion of females. The Emperor could adopt the children or grandchildren of his brothers, and become members of his family from the date of adoption. Sons so adopted enjoyed the right of succession to the throne, immediately after the Emperor&#x27;s natural and legitimate sons.

Jean-Joseph&#x27;s eldest son, Prince Mainville-Joseph Soulouque, was created Prince Imperial of Haiti and heir apparent upon the succession of his uncle to the throne. His marriage to Marie d&#x27;Albert produced a daughter, Marie Adelina Soulouque &quot;princesse impériale d&#x27;Haiti&quot;.

==Exile and death==

In 1858, a revolution against Soulouque was led by General Fabre Geffrard, Duc de Tabara, and in December of that year, Geffrard defeated Soulouque&#x27;s army and seized control of most of Haiti. On the night of 20 December 1858, Soulouque left Port-au-Prince in a small boat, accompanied only by his son and two trusty followers, Ernest Roumain and Jean-Bart, and two days later arrived at Gonaives, where the insurrection broke out. The Republic of Haiti was re-proclaimed and the Constitution of 1846 was adopted.

On 23 December, the Departmental Committee which had been organized, divested Faustin Soulouque of his office and appointed Fabre Geffrard President of Haiti. Cap-Haitien and the whole Department of Artibonite joined in the restoration of the Republic. As a result, Soulouque abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation, Soulouque was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859.

Soon afterwards, Soulouque and his family arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, where they remained for several years. Some records claim that he died in Kingston, but according to Haitian historian Jacques Nicolas Léger in his book &quot;Haiti, her History and her Detractors&quot;, Soulouque actually died in Petit-Goave in August 1867, having returned to Haiti at some point.

<doc id="404884" wikidata="Q3492779" url="?curid=404884" title="Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album was awarded from 1988 to 2011 and from 2017 onwards. Until 1992 the award was known as Best Contemporary Blues Performance and in 1989 was awarded to a song rather than to an album.

The award was discontinued after the 2011 Grammy season in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012 onwards, the category was merged with the [[Best Traditional Blues Album]] category to form the new [[Best Blues Album]] category. However, in 2016 the Grammy organisation decided to revert the situation back to the pre-2012 era, with two separate categories for traditional and contemporary blues recordings respectively.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for music released in the previous year. Buddy Guy and Keb&#x27; Mo hold the record of most wins in the category with four each, followed by Robert Cray, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Taj Mahal and Fantastic Negrito, all with three wins.

<text>The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must is a nonfiction science book by Robert Zubrin, first published in 1996, and revised and updated in 2011.

The book details Zubrin&#x27;s Mars Direct plan to make the first human landing on Mars. The plan focuses on keeping costs down by making use of automated systems and available materials on Mars to manufacture the return journey&#x27;s fuel &quot;in situ&quot;. The book also reveals possible Mars colony designs and weighs the prospects for a colony&#x27;s material self-sufficiency and for the terraforming of Mars.

==Mars Direct==

The Mars Direct plan was originally detailed by Zubrin and David Baker in 1990. &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; is, according to Zubrin, a comprehensive condensation for laymen of many years&#x27; work and research. Chapters 1 and 4 deal primarily with Mars Direct.

==Colonization==
For Robert Zubrin, the attractiveness of Mars Direct does not rest on a single cost-effective mission. He envisions a series of regular Martian missions with the ultimate goal of colonization, which he details in the seventh through ninth chapters. As initial explorers leave hab-structures on the planet, subsequent missions become easier to undertake.

Large mall like structures buried in regolith, pressurized habitats would be the first step toward human settlement; the book suggests they can be built as Roman-style atria on the surface and then be buried with regolith, with easily produced Martian brick. During and after this initial phase of habitat construction, hard-plastic radiation- and abrasion-resistant geodesic domes could be deployed on the surface for eventual habitation and crop growth. Nascent industry would begin using indigenous resources: the manufacture of plastics, ceramics and glass.

The larger work of terraforming requires an initial phase of global warming to release atmosphere from the regolith and to create a water cycle. Three methods of global warming are described in the work and, Zubrin suggests, are probably best deployed in tandem: orbital mirrors to heat the surface; factories on the surface to pump halocarbons such as perfluromethane into the atmosphere; and the seeding of bacteria which can metabolize water, nitrogen and carbon to produce ammonia and methane (these would aid in global warming). While the work of warming Mars is on-going, true colonization can begin.

&quot;The Case for Mars&quot; acknowledges that any Martian colony will be partially Earth-dependent for centuries. However, it suggests that Mars may be a profitable place for two reasons. First, it may contain concentrated supplies of metals of equal or greater value to silver which have not been subjected to millennia of human scavenging and may be sold on Earth for profit. Secondly, the concentration of deuterium – a possible fuel for commercial nuclear fusion – is five times greater on Mars. Humans emigrating to Mars thus have an assured industry and the planet will be a magnet for settlers as wage costs will be high. The book asserts that “the labor shortage that will prevail on Mars will drive Martian civilization toward both technological and social advances.”

==Wider considerations==
While detailing the exploration and colonization, &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; also addresses a number of attendant scientific and political factors.

===Risks confronted===
The fifth chapter analyzes various risks that putatively rule out a long-term human presence on Mars. Zubrin dismisses the idea that radiation and zero-gravity are unduly hazardous. He claims that cancer rates &quot;do&quot; increase for astronauts who have spent extensive time in space, but only marginally. Similarly, while zero-gravity presents challenges, “near total recovery of musculature and immune system occurs after reentry and reconditioning to a one-gravity environment.” Furthermore, since his plan has the spacecraft spinning at the end of a long tether to create artificial gravity, worries about zero gravity do not apply to this mission in any case. Back-contamination – humans acquiring and spreading Martian viruses – is described as &quot;just plain nuts&quot;, because there are no host organisms on Mars for disease organisms to have evolved.

In the same chapter, Zubrin decisively denounces and rejects suggestions that the Moon should be used as waypoint to Mars or as a training area. It is ultimately much easier to journey to Mars from low Earth orbit than from the Moon and using the latter as a staging point is a pointless diversion of resources. While the Moon may superficially appear a good place to perfect Mars exploration and habitation techniques, the two bodies are radically different. The Moon has no atmosphere, no analogous geology and a much greater temperature range and rotational period. Antarctica or desert areas of Earth provide much better training grounds at lesser cost.

===Viability===
In the third and tenth chapters, &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; addresses the politics and costs of the ideas described. The authors argue that the colonization of Mars is a logical extension of the settlement of North America. They envision a frontier society, providing opportunities for innovation and social experimentation.

Zubrin suggests three models to provide the will and capital to drive Mars exploration forward: the J.F.K. model, in which a far-sighted U.S. leader provides the funding and mobilizes national public opinion around the idea; the Sagan model, in which international co-operation is the driving force; and the Gingrich approach, which emphasizes incentives and even prizes for private sector actors who take on research and development tasks. In keeping with the third idea, Zubrin describes twelve challenges that address various aspects of the exploration program. A monetary prize – from five hundred million to twenty billion dollars – is offered to companies who successfully complete the challenges.

The prize-based approach to hardware development has emerged within the private aeronautics community, though not yet on the scale envisioned by Zubrin. Ventures such as the Ansari X-Prize and Robert Bigelow&#x27;s America&#x27;s Space Prize seek low-cost spaceflight development through private enterprise, and crucially, for the attainment of very specific predetermined goals in order to win the prizes.

The underlying political and economic problems of raising sufficient capital for terraforming using halocarbon emissions has been critiqued by John Hickman.

==Translations==
In 2017, a Russian translation of the book was published under the title of &quot;Курс на Марс&quot; (&quot;On Course for Mars&quot;) ().

<text>Tom kha kai, tom kha gai, or Thai coconut soup (, ; ) is a spicy and sour hot soup with coconut milk in Thai cuisine.

== History ==
&quot;Tom kha&quot; is a Thai soup that originated around 1890 and was first recorded in a Thai recipe book. The earliest recorded version of the soup was called &quot;tom kha pet&quot;, and it featured duck and young galangal in a coconut milk-based curry. Over time, chicken became a more popular protein choice and the dish evolved into the version known as &quot;tom kha kai&quot;, which is made with chicken instead of duck. In addition to chicken, shrimp is also a popular protein option and is often referred to as &quot;tom kha kung&quot;. &quot;Tom kha&quot; shares many base ingredients with another popular Thai soup called &quot;tom yam&quot;. However, &quot;tom kha&quot; is distinguished by the addition of coconut milk, which lends it a creamy texture and a milder, sweeter taste compared to &quot;tom yam&quot;.

== Ingredients ==
&quot;Tom kha kai&quot; recipes typically include coconut milk, galangal (sometimes substituted with ginger), kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, Thai chili, coriander (or cilantro), straw mushrooms (or shiitake or other mushrooms), chicken, fish sauce, and lime juice. Fried chilies are sometimes added.

== Variations ==
There are other versions of &quot;tom kha kai&quot; made with seafood (&quot;tom kha thale&quot;, ), mushrooms (&quot;tom kha het&quot;, ), pork (&quot;tom kha mu&quot;, ) and tofu (&quot;tom kha taohu&quot;, ).

<doc id="404899" wikidata="Q240617" url="?curid=404899" title="Père Goriot">
<text>Le Père Goriot (, &quot;Old Goriot&quot; or &quot;Father Goriot&quot;) is an 1835 novel by French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850), included in the &quot;Scènes de la vie privée&quot; section of his novel sequence &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;. Set in Paris in 1819, it follows the intertwined lives of three characters: the elderly doting Goriot, a mysterious criminal-in-hiding named Vautrin and a naive law student named Eugène de Rastignac.

Originally published in serial form during the winter of 1834–1835, &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; is widely considered Balzac&#x27;s most important novel. It marks the first serious use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac&#x27;s fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute details to create character and subtext.

The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought profound changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters – especially young Rastignac, who grew up in the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.

The novel was released to mixed reviews. Some critics praised the author for his complex characters and attention to detail; others condemned him for his many depictions of corruption and greed. A favorite of Balzac&#x27;s, the book quickly won widespread popularity and has often been adapted for film and the stage. It gave rise to the French expression &quot;Rastignac&quot;, a social climber willing to use any means to better his situation.

== Background ==

=== Historical background ===
The novel draws on several historical events that shook the French social order in short succession: the French Revolution, which led to the First Republic; Napoleon&#x27;s rise, the fall and the return of the House of Bourbon. &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; begins in June 1819, four years after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at Waterloo and the Bourbon Restoration. It depicts the mounting tension between the aristocracy, which had returned with King Louis XVIII, and the bourgeoisie produced by the Industrial Revolution. In this period, France saw a tightening of social structures, with a lower class burdened with overwhelming poverty. By one estimate, almost three-quarters of Parisians did not make the 500–600 francs a year necessary for a minimal standard of living. At the same time, this upheaval made possible a social mobility unthinkable during the Ancien Régime. Individuals willing to adapt to the rules of this new society could sometimes ascend into its upper echelons from modest backgrounds, much to the distaste of the established wealthy class.

=== Literary background ===
When Balzac began writing &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; in 1834, he had written several dozen books, including a stream of pseudonymously published potboiler novels. In 1829 he published &quot;Les Chouans&quot;, the first novel to which he signed his own name; this was followed by &quot;Louis Lambert&quot; (1832), &quot;Le Colonel Chabert&quot; (1832), and &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot; (1831). Around this time, Balzac began organizing his work into a sequence of novels that he eventually called &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;, divided into sections representing various aspects of life in France during the early 19th century.

One of these aspects which fascinated Balzac was the life of crime. In the winter of 1828–29, a French grifter-turned-policeman named Eugène François Vidocq published a pair of sensationalized memoirs recounting his criminal exploits. Balzac met Vidocq in April 1834, and used him as a model for a character named Vautrin he was planning for an upcoming novel.

== Writing and publication ==
In the summer of 1834 Balzac began to work on a tragic story about a father who is rejected by his daughters. His journal records several undated lines about the plot: &quot;Subject of Old Goriot – A good man – middle-class lodging-house – 600 fr. income – having stripped himself bare for his daughters who both have 50,000 fr. income – dying like a dog.&quot; He wrote the first draft of &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; in forty autumn days; it was published as a serial in the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot; between December and February. It was released as a stand-alone volume in March 1835 by Edmond Werdet, who also published the second edition in May. A revised third edition was published in 1839 by Charpentier. As was his custom, Balzac made copious notes and changes on proofs he received from publishers, so that the later editions of his novels were often significantly different from the earliest. In the case of &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;, he changed a number of the characters into persons from other novels he had written, and added new passages.

In the first book edition, the novel was divided into seven chapters:

*In the first volume: 
**&quot;Une Pension bourgeoise&quot; (&quot;A Bourgeois Boarding House&quot;); 
**&quot;Les Deux Visites&quot; (&quot;The Two Visits&quot;);
**&quot;L&#x27;Entrée dans le Monde&quot; (&quot;The Entrance into the World&quot;);
*In the second volume:
**&quot;L&#x27;Entrée dans le Monde (Suite)&quot; [&quot;The Entrance into the World (Continuation)&quot;];
**&quot;Trompe-la-Mort&quot; (&quot;Cheat-the-Death&quot;, &quot;Death-Dodger&quot;, or &quot;Dare-Devil&quot;); 
**&quot;Les Deux Filles&quot; (&quot;The Two Daughters&quot;);
**&quot;La Mort du Père&quot; (&quot;The Father&#x27;s Death&quot;).

The character Eugène de Rastignac had appeared as an old man in Balzac&#x27;s earlier philosophical fantasy novel &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot;. While writing the first draft of &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;, Balzac named the character &quot;Massiac&quot;, but he decided to use the same character from &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot;. Other characters were changed in a similar fashion. It was his first structured use of recurring characters, a practice whose depth and rigor came to characterize his novels.

In 1843 Balzac placed &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; in the section of &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot; entitled &quot;Scènes de la vie parisienne&quot; (&quot;Scenes of life in Paris&quot;). Quickly thereafter, he reclassified it – due to its intense focus on the private lives of its characters – as one of the &quot;Scènes de la vie privée&quot; (&quot;Scenes of private life&quot;). These categories and the novels in them were his attempt to create a body of work &quot;depicting all society, sketching it in the immensity of its turmoil&quot;. Although he had prepared only a small predecessor for &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;, entitled &quot;Études de Mœurs&quot;, at this time, Balzac carefully considered each work&#x27;s place in the project and frequently rearranged its structure.

== Plot summary ==

The novel opens with an extended description of the Maison Vauquer, a boarding house in Paris&#x27; &quot;rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève&quot; covered with vines, owned by the widow Madame Vauquer. The residents include the law student Eugène de Rastignac, a mysterious agitator named Vautrin, and an elderly retired vermicelli-maker named Jean-Joachim Goriot. The old man is ridiculed frequently by the other boarders, who soon learn that he has bankrupted himself to support his two well-married daughters.

Rastignac, who moved to Paris from the south of France, becomes attracted to the upper class. He has difficulty fitting in, but is tutored by his cousin, Madame de Beauséant, in the ways of high society. Rastignac endears himself to one of Goriot&#x27;s daughters, Delphine, after extracting money from his own already-poor family. Vautrin, meanwhile, tries to convince Rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named Victorine, whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother. He offers to clear the way for Rastignac by having the brother killed in a duel.

Rastignac refuses to go along with the plot, balking at the idea of having someone killed to acquire his wealth, but he takes note of Vautrin&#x27;s machinations. This is a lesson in the harsh realities of high society. Before long, the boarders learn that police are seeking Vautrin, revealed to be a master criminal nicknamed &quot;Trompe-la-Mort&quot; (&quot;Daredevil&quot;, literally &quot;Cheat-the-Death&quot; or &quot;Death-Dodger&quot;). Vautrin arranges for a friend to kill Victorine&#x27;s brother, in the meantime, and is captured by the police.

Goriot, supportive of Rastignac&#x27;s interest in his daughter and furious with her husband&#x27;s tyrannical control over her, finds himself unable to help. When his other daughter, Anastasie, informs him that she has been selling off her husband&#x27;s family jewelry to pay her lover&#x27;s debts, the old man is overcome with grief at his own impotence and suffers a stroke.

Delphine does not visit Goriot as he lies on his deathbed, and Anastasie arrives too late, only once he has lost consciousness. Before dying, Goriot rages about their disrespect toward him. His funeral is attended only by Rastignac, a servant named Christophe, and two paid mourners. Goriot&#x27;s daughters, rather than being present at the funeral, send their empty coaches, each bearing their families&#x27; respective coat of arms. After the short ceremony, Rastignac turns to face Paris as the lights of evening begin to appear. He sets out to dine with Delphine, and declares to the city: &quot;À nous deux, maintenant!&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s between you and me now!&quot;)

== Style ==
Balzac&#x27;s style in &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; is influenced by the American novelist James Fenimore Cooper and Scottish writer Walter Scott. In Cooper&#x27;s representations of Native Americans, Balzac saw a human barbarism that survived through attempts at civilization. In a preface to the second edition in 1835, Balzac wrote that the title character Goriot – who made his fortune selling vermicelli during a time of widespread hunger – was an &quot;Illinois of the flour trade&quot; and a &quot;Huron of the grain market&quot;. Vautrin refers to Paris as &quot;a forest of the New World where twenty varieties of savage tribes clash&quot; – another sign of Cooper&#x27;s influence.

Scott was also a profound influence on Balzac, particularly in his use of real historical events as the backdrop for his novels. Although history is not central to &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;, the post-Napoleonic era serves as an important setting, and Balzac&#x27;s use of meticulous detail reflects the influence of Scott. In his 1842 introduction to &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;, Balzac praises Scott as a &quot;modern troubadour&quot; who &quot;vivified [literature] with the spirit of the past&quot;. At the same time, Balzac accused the Scottish writer of romanticizing history, and tried to distinguish his own work with a more balanced view of human nature.

Although the novel is often referred to as &quot;a mystery&quot;, it is not an example of whodunit or detective fiction. Instead, the central puzzles are the origins of suffering and the motivations of unusual behavior. Characters appear in fragments, with brief scenes providing small clues about their identity. Vautrin, for example, slips in and out of the story – offering advice to Rastignac, ridiculing Goriot, bribing the housekeeper Christophe to let him in after hours – before he is revealed as a master criminal. This pattern of people moving in and out of view mirrors Balzac&#x27;s use of characters throughout &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;.

&quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; is also recognized as a &quot;bildungsroman&quot;, wherein a naive young person matures while learning the ways of the world. Rastignac is tutored by Vautrin, Madame de Beauséant, Goriot, and others about the truth of Parisian society and the coldly dispassionate and brutally realistic strategies required for social success. As an everyman, he is initially repulsed by the gruesome realities beneath society&#x27;s gilded surfaces; eventually, however, he embraces them. Setting aside his original goal of mastering the law, he pursues money and women as instruments for social climbing. In some ways this mirrors Balzac&#x27;s own social education, reflecting the distaste he acquired for the law after studying it for three years.

=== Recurring characters ===
&quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;, especially in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac&#x27;s trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly different times of life. Pleased with the effect he achieved with the return of Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the same people. Rastignac&#x27;s appearance shows, for the first time in Balzac&#x27;s fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.

Balzac experimented with this method throughout the thirty years he worked on &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;. It enabled a depth of characterization that went beyond simple narration or dialogue. &quot;When the characters reappear&quot;, notes the critic Samuel Rogers, &quot;they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see.&quot; Although the complexity of these characters&#x27; lives inevitably led Balzac to make errors of chronology and consistency, the mistakes are considered minor in the overall scope of the project. Readers are more often troubled by the sheer number of people in Balzac&#x27;s world, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he &quot;did not know where to begin&quot;.

This pattern of character reuse had repercussions for the plot of &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;. Baron de Nucingen&#x27;s reappearance in &quot;La Maison Nucingen&quot; (1837) reveals that his wife&#x27;s love affair with Rastignac was planned and coordinated by the baron himself. This new detail sheds considerable light on the actions of all three characters within the pages of &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;, complementing the evolution of their stories in the later novel.

=== Realism ===
Balzac uses meticulous, abundant detail to describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique gave rise to his title as the father of the realist novel. The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant&#x27;s rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.

At the start of the novel, Balzac declares (in English): &quot;All is true&quot;. Although the characters and situations are fictions, the details employed – and their reflection of the realities of life in Paris at the time – faithfully render the world of the Maison Vauquer. The rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève (where the house is located) presents &quot;a grim look about the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls&quot;. The interiors of the house are painstakingly described, from the shabby sitting room (&quot;Nothing can be more depressing&quot;) to the coverings on the walls depicting a feast (&quot;papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained&quot;) – an ironic decoration in a house known for its wretched food. Balzac owed the former detail to the expertise of his friend Hyacinthe de Latouche, who was trained in the practice of hanging wallpaper. The house is even defined by its repulsive smell, unique to the poor boardinghouse.

== Themes ==
=== Social stratification ===
One of the main themes in &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; is the quest to understand and ascend society&#x27;s strata. The Charter of 1814 granted by King Louis XVIII had established a &quot;legal country&quot; which allowed only a small group of the nation&#x27;s most wealthy men to vote. Thus, Rastignac&#x27;s drive to achieve social status is evidence not only of his personal ambition but also of his desire to participate in the body politic. As with Scott&#x27;s characters, Rastignac epitomizes, in his words and actions, the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; in which he lives.

Through his characters and narration, Balzac lays bare the social Darwinism of this society. In one particularly blunt speech, Madame de Beauséant tells Rastignac:
This attitude is further explored by Vautrin, who tells Rastignac: &quot;The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been discovered, because it was properly executed.&quot; This sentence has been frequently – and somewhat inaccurately – paraphrased as: &quot;Behind every great fortune is a great crime.&quot;

=== Influence of Paris ===
The novel&#x27;s representations of social stratification are specific to Paris, perhaps the most densely populated city in Europe at the time. Traveling only a few blocks – as Rastignac does continually – takes the reader into vastly different worlds, distinguished by their architecture and reflecting the class of their inhabitants. Paris in the post-Napoleonic era was split into distinct neighborhoods. Three of these are featured prominently in &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;: the aristocratic area of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the newly upscale quarter of the rue de la Chaussée-d&#x27;Antin, and the run-down area on the eastern slope of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève.

These &quot;quartiers&quot; of the city serve as microcosms which Rastignac seeks to master; Vautrin, meanwhile, operates in stealth, moving among them undetected. Rastignac, as the naive young man from the country, seeks in these worlds a new home. Paris offers him a chance to abandon his far-away family and remake himself in the city&#x27;s ruthless image. His urban exodus is like that of many people who moved into the French capital, doubling its population between 1800 and 1830. The texture of the novel is thus inextricably linked to the city in which it is set; &quot;Paris&quot;, explains critic Peter Brooks, &quot;is the looming presence that gives the novel its particular tone&quot;.

It is said that in &quot;Le Père Goriot,&quot; Paris becomes a character in the same way the city did in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; and London becomes in Charles Dickens&#x27; works. This is evident in Balzac&#x27;s portrayal of the Parisian society as mercilessly stratified, corrupt, amoral, and money-obsessed. In addition, the protagonists living in its quarters were presented in perfect harmony with their environment.

=== Corruption ===
Rastignac, Vautrin, and Goriot represent individuals corrupted by their desires. In his thirst for advancement, Rastignac has been compared to Faust, with Vautrin as Mephistopheles. Critic Pierre Barbéris calls Vautrin&#x27;s lecture to Rastignac &quot;one of the great moments of the &quot;Comédie humaine&quot;, and no doubt of all world literature&quot;. France&#x27;s social upheaval provides Vautrin with a playground for an ideology based solely on personal advancement; he encourages Rastignac to follow suit.

Still, it is the larger social structure that finally overwhelms Rastignac&#x27;s soul – Vautrin merely explains the methods and causes. Although he rejects Vautrin&#x27;s offer of murder, Rastignac succumbs to the principles of brutality upon which high society is built. By the end of the novel, he tells Bianchon: &quot;I&#x27;m in Hell, and I have no choice but to stay there.&quot;

While Rastignac desires wealth and social status, Goriot longs only for the love of his daughters: a longing that borders on idolatry. Because he represents bourgeois wealth acquired through trade – and not aristocratic primitive accumulation – his daughters are happy to take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, at the end of the book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball.

=== Family relations ===
The relations between family members follow two patterns: the bonds of marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young take the form of sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover – who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.

Parents, meanwhile, give endlessly to their children; Goriot sacrifices everything for his daughters. Balzac refers to him in the novel as the &quot;Christ of paternity&quot; for his constant suffering on behalf of his children. That they abandon him, lost in their pursuit of social status, only adds to his misery. The end of the book contrasts Goriot&#x27;s deathbed moments with a festive ball hosted by Madame de Beauséant – attended by his daughters, as well as Rastignac – suggesting a fundamental schism between society and the family.

The betrayal of Goriot&#x27;s daughters is often compared to that of the characters in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;; Balzac was even accused of plagiarism when the novel was first published. Discussing these similarities, critic George Saintsbury claims that Goriot&#x27;s daughters are &quot;as surely murderesses of their father as [Lear&#x27;s daughters] Goneril and Regan&quot;. As Herbert J. Hunt points out in &quot;Balzac&#x27;s Comédie humaine&quot;, however, Goriot&#x27;s tale is in some ways more tragic, since &quot;he has a Regan and a Goneril, but no Cordelia&quot;.

The narrative of Goriot&#x27;s painful relations with his children has also been interpreted as a tragicomic parable of Louis XVI&#x27;s decline. At a crucial moment of filial sentiment in Balzac&#x27;s novel, Vautrin breaks in singing &quot;O Richard, O mon roi&quot;—the royalist anthem that precipitated the October Days of 1789 and the eventual downfall of Louis XVI—a connection that would have been powerful to Balzac&#x27;s readers in the 1830s. An ill-founded faith in paternal legitimacy follows both Goriot and Louis XVI into the grave.

Rastignac&#x27;s family, off-stage, also sacrifices extensively for him. Convinced that he cannot achieve a decent status in Paris without a considerable display of wealth, he writes to his family and asks them to send him money: &quot;Sell some of your old jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon.&quot; They do send him the money he requests, and – although it is not described directly in the novel – endure significant hardship for themselves as a result. His family, absent while he is in Paris, becomes even more distant despite this sacrifice. Although Goriot and Vautrin offer themselves as father figures to him, by the end of the novel they are gone and he is alone.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; is widely considered Balzac&#x27;s essential novel. Its influence on French literature has been considerable, as shown by novelist Félicien Marceau&#x27;s remark: &quot;We are all children of &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;.&quot; Brooks refers to its &quot;perfection of form, its economy of means and ends&quot;. Martin Kanes, meanwhile, in his book &quot;Le Pére Goriot: Anatomy of a Troubled World&quot;, calls it &quot;the keystone of the &quot;Comédie humaine&quot;&quot;. It is the central text of Anthony Pugh&#x27;s voluminous study &quot;Balzac&#x27;s Recurring Characters&quot;, and entire chapters have been written about the detail of the Maison Vauquer. Because it has become such an important novel for the study of French literature, &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; has been translated many times into many languages. Thus, says Balzac biographer Graham Robb, &quot;&quot;Goriot&quot; is one of the novels of &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot; that can safely be read in English for what it is.&quot;

Initial reviews of the book were mixed. Some reviewers accused Balzac of plagiarism or of overwhelming the reader with detail and painting a simplistic picture of Parisian high society. Others attacked the questionable morals of the characters, implying that Balzac was guilty of legitimizing their opinions. He was condemned for not including more individuals of honorable intent in the book. Balzac responded with disdain; in the second preface of 1835, he wrote with regard to Goriot: &quot;Poor man! His daughters refused to recognize him because he had lost his fortune; now the critics have rejected him with the excuse that he was immoral.&quot;

Many critics of the time, though, were positive: a review in &quot;Le Journal des femmes&quot; proclaimed that Balzac&#x27;s eye &quot;penetrates everywhere, like a cunning serpent, to probe women&#x27;s most intimate secrets&quot;. Another review, in &quot;La Revue du théâtre&quot;, praised his &quot;admirable technique of details&quot;. The many reviews, positive and negative, were evidence of the book&#x27;s popularity and success. One publisher&#x27;s critique dismissed Balzac as a &quot; writer&quot;, although it predicted for him &quot;a brief career, but a glorious and enviable one&quot;.

Balzac himself was extremely proud of the work, declaring even before the final installment was published: &quot;&quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; is a raging success; my fiercest enemies have had to bend the knee. I have triumphed over everything, over friends as well as the envious.&quot; As was his custom, he revised the novel between editions; compared to other novels, however, &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; remained largely unchanged from its initial version.

According to the editor of the Norton Critical Edition, Peter Brooks, the book is now seen as &quot;the most endurably popular of Balzac&#x27;s myriad works&quot; and a &quot;classic of the 19th-century European novel&quot;, somewhat ironically in light of the reviews and Balzac&#x27;s reputation in his own time.

In the years following its release, the novel was often adapted for the stage. Two theatrical productions in 1835 – several months after the book&#x27;s publication – sustained its popularity and increased the public&#x27;s regard for Balzac. In the 20th century, a number of film versions were produced, including adaptations directed by Travers Vale (1915), Jacques de Baroncelli (1922), and Paddy Russell (1968). The name of Rastignac, meanwhile, has become an iconic sobriquet in the French language; a &quot;Rastignac&quot; is synonymous with a person willing to climb the social ladder at any cost.

Another well known line of this book by Balzac is when Vautrin tells Eugene, &quot;In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline.&quot; This has been reworked by Mario Puzo in the novel &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1969) and its film adaptation (1972); &quot;I&#x27;m gonna make him an offer he can&#x27;t refuse&quot;. It was ranked as the second most significant cinematic quote in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2005) by the American Film Institute.

<doc id="404902" wikidata="Q1229512" url="?curid=404902" title="Edmond Malone">
<text>Edmond Malone (4 October 174125 May 1812) was an Irish barrister, Shakespearean scholar and editor of the works of William Shakespeare.

Assured of an income after the death of his father in 1774, Malone was able to give up his law practice for at first political and then more congenial literary pursuits. He went to London, where he frequented literary and artistic circles. He regularly visited Samuel Johnson and was of great assistance to James Boswell in revising and proofreading his &quot;Life&quot;, four of the later editions of which he annotated. He was friendly with Sir Joshua Reynolds, and sat for a portrait now in the National Portrait Gallery.

He was one of Reynolds&#x27; executors, and published a posthumous collection of his works (1798) with a memoir. Horace Walpole, Edmund Burke, George Canning, Oliver Goldsmith, Lord Charlemont, and, at first, George Steevens, were among Malone&#x27;s friends. Encouraged by Charlemont and Steevens, he devoted himself to the study of Shakespearean chronology, and the results of his &quot;An Attempt to Ascertain the Order in Which the Plays Attributed to Shakspeare Were Written&quot; (1778), which finally made it conceivable to try to patch together a biography of Shakespeare through the plays themselves, are still largely accepted.

This was followed in 1780 by two supplementary volumes to Steevens&#x27;s version of Dr Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, partly consisting of observations on the history of the Elizabethan stage, and of the text of doubtful plays; and this again, in 1783, by an appendix volume. His refusal to alter some of his notes to Isaac Reed&#x27;s edition of 1785, which disagreed with Steevens&#x27;s, resulted in a quarrel with the latter. Malone was also a central figure in the refutation of the claim that the Ireland Shakespeare forgeries were authentic works of the playwright, which many contemporary academics had believed.

==Biography==

===Birth and early life===
Edmond Malone was born 4 October 1741 in Dublin to Edmond Malone Sr. (1704–1774)—MP of the Irish House of Commons and judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Ireland—and Catherine Collier, the niece of Robert Knight, 1st Earl of Catherlough. He had two sisters, Henrietta and Catherine, and an older brother, Richard (later Lord Sunderlin). Edmond Malone Sr. was a successful lawyer and politician, educated at Oxford University and the Inner Temple in London, and called to the Bar in England in 1730, where he had a legal practice. But in 1740, a year before Edmond Jr. was born, his practice in England failed and he returned to Ireland. He took up residence with his wife on the family&#x27;s country estate, &quot;Shinglas&quot;, in County Westmeath, and began a more successful legal practice there.
According to Peter Martin, Malone&#x27;s main biographer in the 20th century: &quot;Virtually nothing is known of his childhood and adolescence except that in 1747 he was sent to Dr. Ford&#x27;s preparatory school in Molesworth Street, Dublin, where his brother Richard had already been enrolled for two years&quot;. The next record of his education is 10 years later, in 1757, when he—not yet 16 years old—entered Trinity College Dublin, where his brother went to study two years earlier and where his father had received an honorary LL.D. the year before. Malone excelled at his studies, &quot;an exemplary student, naturally diligent, consistently at the top of his class&quot;, and was awarded with books stamped with the College Arms. In the very first examination, of four in the academic year, he shared top honours with James Drought and John Kearney, who later became Fellows of the college.
As an undergraduate he wrote some poetry and literary history. Of the latter, a noteworthy example is a prose translation of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; by Sophocles with annotations and explanatory notes that Martin describes as &quot;surprisingly erudite&quot;. The translation is accompanied by a twenty-page “… Essay on the Origin and Progress of Tragedy &amp; on the Office &amp; Advantages of the Antient Chorus&quot; where he provides a brief comparison of Sophocles and Euripides and argues in favour of the restoration of the Chorus in modern drama.
His studies were interrupted when, in the summer of 1759, he and his father accompanied his mother to Highgate in England. Catherine&#x27;s health had been deteriorating for some time and she now had increasing difficulty walking. After a short stay in Highgate she moved to the Roman Baths at Bath in Somerset, where the waters were supposed to have health-giving properties. Malone and his father returned to Ireland in October, too late to resume the winter term, so he elected to stay at &quot;Shinglas&quot; until the new year and study on his own. Not wishing to leave his father solitary, he nearly did not return to Trinity, but eventually resumed his studies in January 1760. The expenses for Catherine&#x27;s stay at Bath put a strain on the family finances, but it was alleviated somewhat when, after a special examination on 2 June, he won a scholarship at Trinity and became a Scholar of the House.

Malone&#x27;s final examination at Trinity was in the Michaelmas term in 1761, and he received his BA degree at the following Commencement on 23 February 1762. As only one of three, he achieved the top mark (). The decision to study law was an obvious choice: his father, uncle, and grandfather had all been Irish Barristers. He&#x27;d received—on payment of £3 6s 8d—admittance to the Inner Temple in London in 1761, but did not begin his law studies until the new year in 1763. The interval was spent in Dublin reading, and he quickly applied to become a Reader of the Trinity College Library. Martin speculates that he spent his time reading &quot;possibly law although probably also literature&quot;.
===Law school and legal practice===

Malone probably entered the Inner Temple in January 1763, but few records survive of his studies there; except that he was &quot;invited to come to the bench table&quot; in the commons—an honour Peter Martin describes as comparable to becoming a Warden in a guild—on 10 May 1763. Outside schoolwork he published satirical articles about the government and on the abuse of the English language, and made corrections to the text in his copy of a new edition of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s correspondence. He was admitted to the Inner Temple the same year as James Boswell—a coincidence Martin thinks &quot;literary historians cannot fail to wonder at&quot;—but there is nothing to indicate that they ever crossed paths there.
More significantly, in 1764, Malone&#x27;s close friend Thomas Southwell and his father Edmund introduced Malone to Samuel Johnson, whose quarters on Inner Temple Lane were close to his own lodgings. Martin describes it as “…the most important meeting of Malone&#x27;s life&quot; and he became an &quot;…ardent follower of Johnson&#x27;s and, Boswell excepted, the most enthusiastic defender and celebrator of Johnson&#x27;s writings and life.&quot; Malone&#x27;s friendship with Johnson lasted until the latter&#x27;s death in 1784. Although Malone failed to write down his conversations with Johnson, and none of his letters on the subject to John Chetwood have been found, Martin speculates that Shakespeare must have been among their topics of conversation, as Johnson was just then finishing up his great edition of Shakespeare that he had begun in 1756. They would have found other common interests in the law and Ireland, as Johnson would soon start work as private secretary to the English statesman and Irish politician William Gerard Hamilton. For Hamilton he compiled notes on the Corn Laws that Malone in 1809 would publish, along with two of Hamilton&#x27;s speeches in the Irish House of Commons and some other miscellaneous works, under the title &quot;Parliamentary Logick&quot;.

The Southwells were also his companions when, in the autumn of 1766, he travelled in the south of France. There he visited Paris, Avignon, and Marseille; socialising and relaxing. Around this time he began having doubts about his choice of the law as a career. He was finished at the Inner Temple, but still required further study for the Irish Bar, and his motivation was flagging; particularly since it would mean leaving London and its &quot;coffee-shops, theaters, newspapers, and politics.&quot; There was also some tension between him and his father over this, and over a judgeship his father had been promised by Lord Worthington. On hearing that the judgeship might not come to pass, Malone wrote to his father: &quot;It shall be a lesson to me, never to believe in any great man&#x27;s word, unless coupled with performance, &amp; to aspire by every truest means at the greatest blessing of life, independence.&quot; Both issues resolved themselves shortly however, as his father succeeded to the bench as Judge of the Irish Court of Common Pleas while Malone was still in Marseille. Arriving back in London, without the Southwells, in February he announced his fresh determination to proceed with law: &quot;It is my firm resolution to apply as closely as possible till I go to Ireland, to the study of law, &amp; the practice of the Court of Chancery…&quot;
He was called to the Irish bar in 1767, and from 1769 practised law on the Munster circuit with &quot;indifferent rewards&quot;. He was not having great success in this field, and he missed London with its &quot;…great literary world of Johnson, coffee-houses, theatre, newspapers, and politics.&quot; In the early months of 1769 he also had an intense, but ultimately fruitless, romance with Susanna Spencer. When the relationship failed—for reasons that are unknown but which Martin speculates were related to their families&#x27; relative social status—Malone suffered a &quot;nervous collapse&quot; and &quot;[lost] the will to read, to join in family activities, to practice law.&quot; He spent the better part of the summer in Spa with his brother, while his sisters, by letter, suggested remedies for his low mood and attempted to cheer him up. He returned some time after September, but his depression lingered on. He worked the Munster circuit and at some point after March in 1772 visited London, perhaps on the suggestion of his exasperated father. How long he remained or what his activities were is not known. He returned to Ireland and the Munster circuit, but, in private letters, complained of his boredom with this occupation.

===Literature, theatre, and politics===

To relieve his boredom, Malone diverted himself with literary studies. On a visit with Dr. Thomas Wilson, Senior Fellow of Trinity College, in 1774 he discovered several papers by Alexander Pope that Henry St John, the poet&#x27;s literary executor, had collected. Among them was a manuscript in Pope&#x27;s handwriting of his unfinished poem &quot;One Thousand Seven Hundred and Forty&quot;. Malone transcribed a facsimile of the manuscript, including &quot;interlineations, corrections, alterations&quot;, but he failed to publish it and the original manuscript has since been lost.

On 4 April 1774, the Irish-born author Oliver Goldsmith died. Malone had known Goldsmith, either in Dublin or in London in the 1760s, and to honour his friend he participated in an amateur production of Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; (1773). The event was held on 27 September 1774 and had strong patriotic overtones: it was staged at the country seat of Sir Hercules Langrishe—a member of the Irish House of Commons—at Knocktopher, and the Irish politicians and patriots Henry Grattan and Henry Flood both played parts. According to Martin&#x27;s description, &quot;Malone played two parts and wrote an excessively long epilogue of eighty-two lines, with several allusions that suggest his literary tastes. […] It celebrates Shakespeare, touches on Irish politics […], and concludes with a panegyric on the stage […]&quot;.
Irish politics seems to have been especially on his mind in this period. In 1772 he contributed to &quot;Baratariana&quot;, a volume principally by Langrishe, but supplemented with letters by Flood and Grattan. The letters attack the current government in the style of Junius, who had published similar letters in England between 1769 and 1772, and Malone may have contributed &quot;a weakly ironic piece in which he lamented the Irish consumption of millions of eggs every year when a little restraint could yield more substantial food in the form of chickens.&quot; His father died unexpectedly on 22 March 1774, leaving the four siblings with a modest income, and Malone free to pursue interests outside the drudgery of his legal practice. His ambition was politics, and that summer he proposed himself as candidate to a seat in Parliament for Trinity College. Objections were raised that his uncle, Anthony Malone, had joined the Townshend government whose autocratic policies the university was firmly against. In his speech to the electors, Malone defended his uncle as a man of principle rather than party, who sought to do his best for his constituents rather than gain advantage for himself and his friends: &quot;no man perhaps ever supported the administration so disinterestedly, or got so few favours from Government either for himself or his connexions.&quot; To the charge that the filial association was an impediment to his nomination he protested, later in his speech:

Corruption and self-interest he saw as the great problem of men in elected office, and in his speech he attacked them as opposing reform for fear of losing their advantage:


He won the nomination, but the election was not until May 1776, and, a few days prior, Anthony Malone died, leaving Malone an annual income of £ (roughly equivalent to £ today) and the entire estate at &quot;Baronston&quot; to his brother, Richard. The legacy left him free to pursue a life of scholarship, and he promptly gave up the nomination in favour of contributing to a new edition of Goldsmith that was being prepared. He travelled to London to interview the people who had known Goldsmith and collect information and anecdotes about him. He spent six months there but apart from a letter from Susanna Spencer, in reply to a letter from Malone that is now lost, we have no information about his activities there. In February 1777, suffering from his first bout of rheumatism, he returned to Ireland, and shortly afterward, &quot;Poems and Plays by Oliver Goldsmith&quot; was published. Malone had contributed an eight-page memoir of Goldsmith and annotations to the poems and plays. The memoir was based on &quot;Authentic Anecdotes&quot; by Richard Glover—published in &quot;The Universal Magazine&quot; in May 1774, and Edmund Burke included it in &quot;The Annual Register&quot; for that year—as well as first-hand information from Dr. Wilson at Trinity.

===London and Shakespeare===

While in London to do research for his memoir of Goldsmith in 1776, Malone sought out George Steevens, who, by then the inheritor, from Samuel Johnson, of the editor&#x27;s mantle for the Jacob Tonson edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s collected works, was then busy preparing a second edition. Steevens invited Malone to help him complete it. To help him get started, Steevens lent Malone his copy of &quot;An Account of the English Dramatic Poets&quot; (1691) by Gerard Langbaine, into which Steevens had transcribed notes by William Oldys in addition to the notes he had added himself. When Malone returned to Ireland in early 1777, he set about transcribing all the annotations into his own copy. He finished the transcription on 30 March, and on 1 May he left Ireland for good.

Malone moved into a house in Sunninghill, about outside London, and started work. In the following months he sent a steady stream of notes and corrections to Steevens and in January 1778 &quot;The Plays of William Shakspeare&quot; was published in 10 volumes. Malone&#x27;s main contribution appeared in the first volume as &quot;An Attempt to Ascertain the Order in Which the Plays Attributed to Shakspeare Were Written&quot;. The &quot;Attempt&quot; was well received and garnered him more attention than the notes and corrections he had supplied Steevens with. With his first major contribution to Shakespeare studies published, he left Sunninghill to reside in London; first, briefly, in Marylebone Street and then in a house he rented at 55 Queen Anne Street East in what is now Foley Street in Marylebone.
In late 1778 he visited Ireland for a few months, and in February 1779, shortly after he returned, he began to have his portrait painted by Joshua Reynolds. Reynolds was then much sought after as a portrait painter, and a &quot;face and shoulders&quot; by Reynolds cost 35 guineas (£36.75). His uncle, Anthony Malone, had had his portrait painted by Reynolds in 1774, and Malone himself had good company: during the ten times between 23 February and 10 July that he sat for the portrait, Reynolds&#x27;s appointment book shows that he sat on the same date as Edward Gibbon, the British historian and MP; George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough; Hester Thrale, author of &quot;Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson&quot; and a close friend of Johnson; and (28 April and 17 May) George III, then king of England and Ireland. Malone befriended Reynolds and they remained close friends until the latter&#x27;s death in 1792, when Reynolds named Malone his executor along with Edmund Burke and Philip Metcalfe.

Malone&#x27;s next scholarly project was an addendum to the Johnson–Steevens &quot;Shakespeare&quot;. Pleased with Malone&#x27;s contributions to the edition, Steevens invited him to publish the apocryphal plays that had been included in the second edition of the Third Folio published by Philip Chetwinde in 1664. It was Malone&#x27;s project—and with only grudging acceptance from Steevens he expanded the work to include the narrative poems and the Sonnets—but he and Steevens worked closely together, and solicited notes from Isaac Reed, William Blackstone, and Thomas Percy. Until this point their relationship had been a cordial and productive one—Steevens having given Malone his first opportunity as an editor of Shakespeare, and in return having benefitted greatly from the younger scholar&#x27;s work—but while working on the addendum they had a falling-out. Steevens brought up Susanna Spencer and suggested that Malone&#x27;s work on Shakespeare was a mere device to keep his mind distracted from the unhappy relationship. Malone took umbrage at this, his ambition being a life of professional scholarship, and replied that, to the contrary, he intended to produce a completely new edition of Shakespeare, &quot;more scientifically and methodically edited than the &quot;Johnson–Steevens&quot; edition was ever likely to become.&quot; They settled their differences, but Steevens was now beginning to feel his position as the foremost editor of Shakespeare threatened. Malone was aggressive and arrogant, and his constant stream of corrections grated on the older editor. Despite the strained relationship, in late April 1780, &quot;A Supplement to the Edition of Shakespeare, Published in 1778 by Samuel Johnson and George Steevens&quot; was published in two volumes. The work met with generally positive reviews, particularly from &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Monthly Review&quot;. But there was also criticism from the &quot;St. James&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, in which Steevens had a financial interest, that Martin describes as consisting of &quot;anonymous and trifling notes […] which niggled at minor points, textual and factual&quot;, which were probably written by Steevens or at his behest.

===Social rise and &quot;The Club&quot;===

When Malone first arrived in England in 1777 he already had a connection to Samuel Johnson and George Steevens, and, through his boyhood friend Robert Jephson, to James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont. Johnson, of course, was among the most esteemed men of letters, and Steevens was then the foremost commentator on Shakespeare and the current inheritor of the editor&#x27;s mantle for the Tonson editions; but Charlemont also had the connections to introduce Malone to a wide variety of the eminent men of the day. With these recommendations and the fame garnered by his scholarly work he was by the early 1780s often to be found in the company of the greatest literary and theatrical minds of the era. He dined regularly with Johnson, Steevens, Reed, Reynolds, Richard Farmer, Horace Walpole, John Nichols, and John Henderson. But by this time Johnson&#x27;s advancing age and ill health prevented his socialising as much as in earlier years, and Malone did not often enough get a chance to spend time with him or people like Edmund Burke, James Boswell, Edward Gibbon, Charles Burney, Joseph Banks, William Windham, Charles James Fox, or John Wilkes.

At the same time, membership in &quot;The Club&quot;—founded by Johnson and Reynolds in 1764, and whose membership included several of those people whom Malone longed to see—had become a much sought-after honour. Malone dearly wanted to get in, but even though he had the support of Charlemont and Reynolds, he was thwarted by circumstances. The Club was founded specifically to be exclusive, and to that end limited the number of members, at that time to 35 at any given time. Since members very rarely left, the only openings came when a member died; and after the latest member, David Garrick, had died in 1779, the members resolved to keep his spot open in honour of the great actor and theatre manager. Votes were taken on several occasions, but the candidates were always blackballed.

It was not until 5 February 1782 that &quot;[…] the memory of Garrick having dimmed sufficiently, Malone at last was admitted into this august company […]&quot;. He attended his first meeting on 19 February 1782 and quickly became one of The Club&#x27;s most enthusiastic supporters and, as its treasurer, held the only permanent office associated with it. His motivation for wanting to join The Club was partly to see Johnson more often, but Johnson&#x27;s health was deteriorating and no longer attended the club&#x27;s dinners regularly. The first one he attended after Malone was accepted was on 2 April 1782, and in the period until Johnson&#x27;s death on 13 December 1784, they saw each other at the club only five times; the last time on 22 June 1784, when Johnson &quot;was in obvious pain and had to drag himself to get there.&quot; Johnson was also too ill to visit Malone, but he appreciated company at his house at Bolt Court, and Malone visited frequently. He kept notes on their conversations that Boswell later included in his &quot;The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.&quot; (1791), and the letter to Malone from John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington is the best account that survives of Johnson&#x27;s last hours.

===Chatterton forgeries===
In 1769, the poet Thomas Chatterton, only 17 years old, sent Horace Walpole the first of a series of poems supposedly written by a 15th-century monk named Thomas Rowley but really written by Chatterton himself. Other poems followed, and Walpole was briefly taken in but later reconsidered. When Chatterton committed suicide the following year, there were rumours that Walpole&#x27;s treatment of the young man had played a part. Despite Walpole&#x27;s scepticism, in 1777, shortly after Edmond Malone&#x27;s arrival in London, Thomas Tyrwhitt published Chatterton&#x27;s forgeries as &quot;Poems, Supposed to Have Been Written at Bristol, by Thomas Rowley and Others, in the Fifteenth Century&quot;. This created a great controversy, with much debate about their authenticity. For the third edition in 1778 he added an appendix arguing against the poems&#x27; antiquity, and Thomas Warton, in his &quot;The History of English Poetry&quot; (1778), devoted an entire chapter to it. Those favouring the authenticity of the Rowley poems responded in late 1781 when, just days apart, Jacob Bryant, a classical scholar, published &quot;Observations upon the Poems of Thomas Rowley; in Which the Authenticity of Those Poems is Ascertained&quot;, and Jeremiah Milles, Dean of Exeter and President of the Society of Antiquaries of London, published &quot;Poems, Supposed to Have Been Written at Bristol, in the Fifteenth Century, by Thomas Rowley, Priest, &amp;c.; With a Commentary in Which the Antiquity of Them Is Considered and Defended&quot;.
The controversy was a perfect match for Malone: steeped in ancient and early modern English literature, by trade a lawyer, and with no patience for literary forgeries or those who entertained them. As Martin puts it he &quot;entered the fray&quot; in December 1781 by &quot;[sending] an anonymous &#x27;brat into the world&#x27;&quot; The &quot;brat&quot; was an article in two parts in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, signed &quot;Misopiclerus&quot;. The essay met with success, and by February he published a second edition as &quot;Cursory Observations on the Poems Attributed to Thomas Rowley&quot;. In the essay he compares the Rowley poems to poetry by actual writers of the era; shows Chatterton&#x27;s sources to have been later writers like Shakespeare, Pope, and Dryden; picks holes in the arguments put forward by Chatterton&#x27;s supporters; and ends on an awkward attempt to ridicule Bryant and Milles.

==Collections==

Before he died, Malone detailed what should be done with his library in his will:
In 1815 Lord Sunderlin announced his intention to donate part of his late brother&#x27;s library to the Bodleian once the new edition of Malone&#x27;s Shakespeare (the Variorum Shakespeare) was complete. He reserved c. 800 volumes for the Library, while the rest was sold in 1818 at Sotheby&#x27;s. In 1821 the collection was received by the Bodleian.

The early editions of Shakespeare in the collection were described by Malone in 1801: 

The influence of the Malone collection from its 1821 receipt in the Bodleian is shown by both the donations to and purchases of the Library in the years following: in 1833 Thomas Caldecott donated his poems of Shakespeare, and at the Heber sale in 1834, and afterward, further gaps in the collection were filled. In 1835 B. H. Bright gave Malone&#x27;s copy of Anthony Wood&#x27;s Athenae to the Bodleian, in 1836 the Bodleian bought papers relating to Pope, as well as, in 1838, collections for the last edition of Malone&#x27;s Shakespeare and for the illustration of ancient manners, 76 volumes of eighteenth-century pamphlets, and part of his literary correspondence. In 1851 Malone&#x27;s letters from Thomas Percy were acquired, in 1858 his Oxford research notes, in 1864 letters from Samuel Johnson, Mrs Siddons, and others, and in 1878 further correspondence, papers, and books. The mention of this purchase in the Athenaeum encouraged Mr. L. Sharpe of the Guildhall Library to present the Bodleian with Malone&#x27;s letters to his grandfather. In 1881, 76 volumes of pamphlets was also purchased by the Library.

Most of Malone&#x27;s books are bound with &#x27;E. M.&#x27; in an &#x27;interlaced monogram&#x27; on the back, with a few featuring a book-plate with his coat-of-arms on.

===&quot;The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare&quot;===
The years from 1783 to 1790 were devoted to Malone&#x27;s own edition of Shakespeare in multiple volumes, of which his essays on the history of the stage, his biography of Shakespeare, and his attack on the genuineness of the three parts of &quot;Henry VI&quot;, were especially valuable. His editorial work was lauded by Burke, criticised by Walpole and damned by Joseph Ritson. It certainly showed indefatigable research and proper respect for the text of the earlier editions.

===The Ireland forgeries===

Malone published a denial of the claim to antiquity of the Rowley poems produced by Thomas Chatterton, and in this (1782) as in his branding (1796) of the Ireland manuscripts as forgeries, he was among the first to guess and state the truth. His elaborate edition of John Dryden&#x27;s works (1800), with a memoir, was another monument to his industry, accuracy and scholarly care. In 1801 he received an LL.D. from Trinity College Dublin.

===Malone–Boswell &quot;Shakespeare&quot;===
At the time of his death, Malone was at work on a new octavo edition of Shakespeare, and he left his material to James Boswell the younger; the result was the edition of 1821 generally known as the &quot;Third Variorum edition&quot; in twenty-one volumes. Lord Sunderlin (1738–1816), his elder brother and executor, presented the larger part of Malone&#x27;s book collection, including dramatic varieties, to the Bodleian Library, which subsequently bought many of his manuscript notes and his literary correspondence. The British Museum also owns some of his letters and his annotated copy of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;.

A memoir of Malone by James Boswell is included in the to the edition of 1821.

==Reputation and legacy==
The Malone Society, devoted to the study of sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century English drama, was named after him.

<text>Betty Louise McCollum ( ; born July 12, 1954) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for , serving since 2001. She is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). McCollum&#x27;s district centers on St. Paul, Minnesota&#x27;s capital city. She is the second woman elected to Congress from Minnesota. McCollum became the dean of Minnesota&#x27;s congressional delegation in 2021.

Before her election to the U.S. House, McCollum served eight years as a state representative.

==Biography==
McCollum was born in Minneapolis. She graduated from the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1976. McCollum has worked as a high school social sciences teacher and as a sales manager.

She first won election to the North St. Paul city council in 1986. In 1992 she was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives after she defeated an incumbent state representative in the DFL primary. She served four terms in the Minnesota House before being elected to Congress in 2000.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Campaigns===

After 4th district Representative Bruce Vento decided not to seek a 13th term due to illness in 2000 (he died before the election), McCollum won the DFL nomination to succeed him. The district is heavily Democratic; among Minnesota&#x27;s congressional districts, only the neighboring Minneapolis-based 5th district is considered more Democratic. The DFL has held the seat without interruption since 1949.

McCollum&#x27;s main concern during the campaign wasn&#x27;t her Republican opponent, State Senator Linda Runbeck, but Independence Party candidate Tom Foley. Foley had previously been county attorney for Ramsey County (almost all of which is in the 4th district) as a Democrat. Many thought Foley might siphon off enough votes from McCollum to allow Runbeck to win. But McCollum defeated Runbeck by 17 points, with Foley in a distant third place. Foley held McCollum to 48% of the vote, making her the only Democrat not to win at least 50% of the vote since Democrats began their dominance in the district. The district has since reverted to form, and McCollum has been reelected nine times with no substantive opposition.

===Tenure===
According to the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, McCollum held a Bipartisan Index Score of -0.1 in the 116th United States Congress for 2019, which placed her 219th out of 435 members. Based on FiveThirtyEight&#x27;s congressional vote tracker at ABC News, McCollum voted with Donald Trump&#x27;s stated public policy positions 11.4% of the time, which ranked her average in the 116th United States Congress when predictive scoring (district partisanship and voting record) is used. In the 117th Congress, she voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time.

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Defense (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies

====Party leadership, caucus, and other memberships====
* Senior Whip
* Co-founder of the Congressional Global Health Caucus
* Co-founder of the Quality Care Coalition
* Vice Chair of Congressional Native American Caucus (Co-Chair Emeritus)
* National Council on the Arts
* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (Associate Member)
* Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety
* International Conservation Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Afterschool Caucuses
* Co-Chair United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
* Veterinary Medicine Caucus
* Congressional Coalition on Adoption
* Congressional Caucus for the Equal Rights Amendment
* Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus

McCollum is the first woman elected to Congress from Minnesota since Coya Knutson in the 1950s.

McCollum received a 91% progressive rating from Progressive Punch, a self-described nonpartisan group that provides a &quot;searchable database of Congressional voting records from a Progressive perspective&quot;, and a 13% conservative rating from the conservative SBE Council.

== Political positions ==
McCollum is pro-choice and supports Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Association. The latter organization aims to provide access to family planning and reproductive health care services and advocates for reproductive freedom. She indicated on the 2002 National Political Awareness Test that she believed abortions should always be legally available, but only within the first trimester of pregnancy.

McCollum has consistently supported the rights of members in the LGBTQ community. The Human Rights Campaign, one of America&#x27;s largest civil rights organization working to achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality, has continually approved of her voting record. In a speech opposing the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, McCollum said, &quot;Gay and lesbian Americans are citizens who must never be treated as second-class citizens&quot;.

She has supported the interests of the elderly with regard to preserving Social Security. She has backed organizations such as the Alliance for Retired Americans and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, which share the mission to ensure social and economic justice and full civil rights for all citizens so that they may enjoy lives of dignity, personal and family fulfillment and security. In a position paper, McCollum defended her position on Social Security, writing, &quot;We can secure the future of Social Security with common sense and a shared, bipartisan commitment to economic security and fiscal responsibility for all Americans. This is my commitment, and you can count on me to work to protect Social Security and to find a solution that truly protects the retirement security of every American.&quot;

McCollum advocates shifting America&#x27;s energy consumption to cleaner, non-carbon-based sources. Along with Al Franken and Kit Bond, she introduced the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act, a bill to utilize thermal energy sources and create renewable energy production tax credits. She also voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment in 2009.

In 2004, McCollum gained national visibility when she and fellow Democrat Jim McDermott of Washington called for Secretary of Education Rod Paige to resign for claiming the National Education Association was &quot;a terrorist organization.&quot;

She also introduced amendments in June 2011 and 2012 to cut funding for military bands by $125 million, a proposal opposed by the Fleet Reserve Association and which the National Association for Music Education called &quot;potentially devastating.&quot;

McCollum opposes Conceal-and-Carry legislation and voted against Right-to-Carry reciprocity in November 2011.

In July 2019, McCollum voted against a House resolution introduced by Representative Brad Schneider of Illinois opposing the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel. The resolution passed 398-17. In February 2020, McCollum called AIPAC a hate group and accused it of hate speech.

In April 2021, McCollum introduced the Defending the Human Rights of Palestinian Children and Families Living under Israeli Military Occupation Act, a bill that aims to prohibit Israel from using U.S. aid to detain Palestinian minors, demolish Palestinian homes, or further annex West Bank land. The bill requires the State Department to file an annual report to Congress detailing the extent to which U.S. aid from the previous fiscal year was used to bankroll any of the aforementioned activities.

On July 18, 2023, McCollum voted &quot;present&quot; on a congressional non-binding resolution proposed by August Pfluger that &quot;the State of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state&quot;, that Congress rejects &quot;all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia&quot;, and that “the United States will always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel&quot;.

On July 19, 2024, McCollum called for Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election.

<doc id="404907" wikidata="Q3160976" url="?curid=404907" title="James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont">
<text>James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont KP PC (Ire) (18 August 1728 – 4 August 1799), was an Irish statesman.

==Life==
===Early life===
The son of James Caulfeild, 3rd Viscount Charlemont, he was born in Dublin, and succeeded his father as 4th Viscount in 1734. His mother was Elizabeth Bernard, daughter of Francis Bernard, MP and judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) and Alice Ludlow. After his father&#x27;s death, she remarried Thomas Adderley, and died in childbirth in 1743 at the age of 40, after the birth of her daughter Elizabeth, who later married Major David Ross.

The title of Charlemont descended from Sir Toby Caulfeild (1565–1627) of Oxfordshire, England, who was given lands in Ireland, and created Baron Charlemont (the name of a fort on the Blackwater), for his services to King James I in 1620. The 1st Viscount was the 5th Baron (d. 1671), who was advanced in the peerage by Charles II.

===Art and culture===
Lord Charlemont was well known for his love of Classical art and culture and spent nine years on the Grand Tour in Italy, Greece, Turkey and Egypt.
He promised Giovanni Battista Piranesi money to print the 1756 edition of &quot;Le antichità romane&quot;.
When Charlemont did not provide the funds, Piranesi scratched his name from the dedication print inspired by the Roman practice of .
The artist pleaded his point in (&quot;Justification letters written to Lord Charlemont&quot;) (1757).
He returned to Dublin and employed the Scottish architect Sir William Chambers to remodel his main residence Marino House and the unique Neo-Classical garden pavilion building adjacent, the Casino at Marino, as well as to design his townhouse Charlemont House.

His former townhouse at 14 Jervis Street was gifted to the then fledgling Jervis Street Hospital and opened in 1796.

===Politics===

Lord Charlemont is historically interesting for his political connection with Henry Flood and Henry Grattan; he was a cultivated man with literary and artistic tastes, and both in Dublin and in London he had considerable social influence. He was the first President of the Royal Irish Academy and was a member of the Royal Dublin Society. He was appointed Custos Rotulorum of County Armagh for life in 1760. For various early services in Ireland, he was made an earl in 1763, but he disregarded court favours and cordially joined Grattan in 1780 in the assertion of Irish independence. In 1783 he was made a founding Knight of the Order of St Patrick.

He was president of the volunteer convention in Dublin in November 1783, having taken a leading part in the formation of the Irish Volunteers; and he was a strong opponent of the proposals for the Union. His eldest son, who succeeded him, was subsequently (1837) created an English Baron.

==Personal life==
In 1768 Charlemont married Mary Hickman, daughter of Thomas Hickman of Brickhill, County Clare. The marriage is said to have been a very happy one. They had two sons, James and Henry.

His half-sister, Elizabeth Adderley (born 23 May 1743), was the mother of Major-General Robert Ross.

The somewhat inaccurate &quot;Memoirs of the Political and Private Life of James Caulfield, Earl of Charlemont, Knight of St. Patrick&quot;, by Francis Hardy, appeared in 1810.

<text>George Steevens (10 May 1736 – 22 January 1800) was an English Shakespearean commentator.

==Biography==
===Early life===
George Steevens was born at Poplar, on 10 May 1736, the son of a captain and later director of the East India Company. He was educated at Eton College and at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he remained from 1753 to 1756. Leaving the university without a degree, he settled in chambers in the Inner Temple, moving later to a house on Hampstead Heath, where he collected a valuable library, rich in Elizabethan literature. He also accumulated a large collection of Hogarth prints, and his notes on the subject were incorporated in John Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Genuine Works of Hogarth&quot;.

===Career===
Steevens walked from Hampstead to London every morning before seven o&#x27;clock, discussed Shakespearian questions with his friend, Isaac Reed, and, after making his daily round of the booksellers shops, returned to Hampstead. He began his work as a Shakespearean editor with reprints of the quarto editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, entitled &quot;Twenty of the Plays of Shakespeare ...&quot; (1766). Samuel Johnson was impressed by this work, and suggested that Steevens should prepare a complete edition of Shakespeare. The result, known as Johnson&#x27;s and Steevens&#x27;s edition, was &quot;The Plays of Shakespeare with the Corrections and Illustrations of Various Commentators&quot; (10 vols., 1773), Johnson&#x27;s contributions to which were very slight.

This early attempt at a &quot;variorum&quot; edition was revised and reprinted in 1778, and further edited in 1785 by Reed; but in 1793 Steevens, who had asserted that he was now a dowager-editor, was persuaded by his jealousy of Edmond Malone to resume the task. The definitive result of his researches was embodied in an edition of fifteen volumes. He made changes in the text sometimes apparently with the sole object of showing how much abler he was as an emendator than Malone, but his wide knowledge of Elizabethan literature stood him in good stead, and subsequent editors have gone to his pages for parallel passages from contemporary authors. His deficiencies from the point of view of purely literary criticism are apparent from the fact that he excluded Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets and poems because, he wrote, &quot;the strongest act of parliament that could be framed would fail to compel readers into their service.&quot;

In the 20 years between 1773 and 1793, Steevens was less harmlessly engaged in criticizing his fellows and playing malicious practical jokes on them. Dr Johnson, who was one of his staunchest friends, said he had come to live the life of an outlaw, but he was generous and to a small circle of friends civil and kind. After Johnson&#x27;s death in Dec. 1784, he sent a series of anonymous items to the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; promoting the claims of James Boswell as Johnson&#x27;s biographer, mainly in order to vex the official biographer, Sir John Hawkins. He was one of the foremost in exposing the Chatterton-Rowley and the Ireland forgeries. He wrote an entirely fictitious account of the Java upas tree, derived from an imaginary Dutch traveller, which imposed on Erasmus Darwin, and he hoaxed the Society of Antiquaries with the tombstone of Hardicanute, supposed to have been dug up in Kennington, but really engraved with an Anglo-Saxon inscription of his own invention.

=== Death and legacy ===
Steevens died at Hampstead on 22 January 1800. A monument to his memory by John Flaxman, with an inscription commemorating his Shakespearian labours, was erected in Poplar Chapel. The sale catalogue of his valuable library is in the British Museum.

Steevens&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare&quot; was re-issued by Reed in 1803, in 21 volumes, with additional notes left by Steevens. This, which is known as the first edition, was reprinted in 1813.

===Honours===
Steevens was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1767.

<doc id="404918" wikidata="Q5980243" url="?curid=404918" title="I was glad">
<text>&#x27;I was glad&#x27; () is an English text drawn from selected verses of Psalm 122. It has been used at Westminster Abbey in the coronation ceremonies of British monarchs since those of King Charles I in 1626.

==Text==
The text accompanies the monarch&#x27;s entrance into Westminster Abbey and was formalised in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.
# I was glad when they said unto me : We will go into the house of the Lord.
# Our feet shall stand in thy gates : O Jerusalem.
# Jerusalem is built as a city : that is at unity in itself.
# For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord : to testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
# For there is the seat of judgement : even the seat of the house of David.
# O pray for the peace of Jerusalem : they shall prosper that love thee.
# Peace be within thy walls : and plenteousness within thy palaces.
# For my brethren and companions&#x27; sakes : I will wish thee prosperity.
# Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God : I will seek to do thee good.
The selected verses (verses 4, 5, 8 and 9 are omitted) form a prayer for the peace and prosperity of Jerusalem, and its use in the coronation service clearly draws a parallel between Jerusalem and the United Kingdom.

===&#x27;Vivat&quot; interpolation===
Since the coronation of King James II in 1685 an additional non-biblical text is added to the psalm verses used in the Westminster Abbey ceremonies, i.e. the acclamation &quot;Vivat Rex ... &quot; or &quot;Vivat Regina ... &quot; (&quot;Long live King/Queen ...&quot;).
By tradition this acclamation is made by King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s Scholars of Westminster School as the Sovereign passes through the Quire of Westminster Abbey.

===&quot;Vivat&quot; pronunciation===
The acclamation uses a variant of standard Latin pronunciation known as Anglicised Latin. Scholars of Classical Latin would pronounce the Vivat Regina as ; those of Ecclesiastical Latin would pronounce it . The traditional English pronunciation when referring to the British monarch is . At the coronation of both a king and a queen, the &quot;vivat&quot; for the queen precedes that for the king.

<text>William Black (13 November 1841 – 10 December 1898) was a novelist born in Glasgow, Scotland. During his lifetime, Black&#x27;s novels were immensely popular and compared favourably with those of Anthony Trollope. However, his fame and popularity did not survive long into the 20th century.

==Biography==
William was born to James Black and his second wife Caroline Conning. He was educated to be a landscape painter, a training that influenced his literary life. As a writer, he became known for his detailed, atmospheric descriptions of landscapes and seascapes in novels such as &quot;White Wings: A Yachting Romance&quot; (1880).

At the age of 23 he went to London, having had some experience with Glasgow journalism. He joined the staff of the &quot;Morning Star&quot; and later the &quot;Daily News&quot;, of which he became assistant-editor. He wrote a weekly serial in &quot;The Graphic&quot;. During the Austro-Prussian War, he acted as a war correspondent.

Black&#x27;s first novel, &quot;James Merle&quot;, appeared in 1864, and had little success. Black later disowned it and reputedly bought copies to destroy them. Two further early novels &quot;Love or Marriage&quot; (1868) and &quot;The Monarch of Mincing Lane&quot; (1871) did little to advance his career, and all three were omitted from the collected edition of Black&#x27;s works issued by the publisher Sampson Low from 1892.

The publication of &quot;A Daughter of Heth&quot; in 1871 at once established his popularity. It tells of a young girl brought up in Catholic France, who comes to live with her more austere Protestant relatives in southern Scotland, and ends with personal tragedy. The travel story &quot;The Strange Adventures of a Phaeton&quot; followed in 1872. In 1874 &quot;A Princess of Thule&quot; was another big success, later adapted into a musical play, &quot;The Maid of Arran&quot;, by a young L. Frank Baum.

From the following year Black devoted himself wholly to fiction. Several collections of short stories and a further 22 novels followed; the last – &quot;Wild Eelin&quot; – in 1898, just before his death on 10 December of that year.

During his lifetime, Black&#x27;s novels were immensely popular and were compared favourably with those of Anthony Trollope, though some critics complained that they put too much emphasis on hunting and fishing. However, his fame and popularity did not survive long into the 20th century. His works were bootlegged in the United States, not being protected by copyright laws. He teamed with such well-known authors as Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy and Walter Besant to combat this procedure, resulting in the passing of new laws in 1891, but unlike the others, he held no grudge against those who sold unauthorised copies of his books while it was legal to do so, which made relations easier and friendlier between him and his American publishers. Baum&#x27;s play was written without regard to copyright courtesy when such was legal: it is uncertain if Black was even aware of its existence, as Reid does not mention it in his biography. (He did not receive credit in the play&#x27;s advertising or programs, although reviewers often mentioned him.)

His later novels included two further &quot;tragic&quot; tales: &quot;Madcap Violet&quot; (1876) and &quot;Macleod of Dare&quot; (1879); &quot;Sunrise&quot; (1881) a novel of international political intrigue; &quot;Shandon Bells&quot; (1883) largely set in Ireland; &quot;Yolande&quot; (1883). in part dealing with drug addiction; &quot;Judith Shakespeare&quot; (1884) a historical novel featuring the playwright&#x27;s daughter; and &quot;The New Prince Fortunatus&quot; (1890) a novel of London theatrical life. Friendship with the actor Mary Anderson resulted in him acting on stage twice, in mute roles known as &quot;thinkers&quot; (in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;), but his nervousness interrupted the performance.
 Black also produced the volume &quot;Goldsmith&quot; (1878) for Morley&#x27;s &quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series.

Black is remembered by a lighthouse built in the form of a Gothic tower &quot;on a spot that he knew and loved, by his friends and admirers from all over the world,&quot; as recorded on a carved plaque over the door. The building was erected in 1901 and is still in use as a lighthouse. It stands a mile or so south of Duart Castle, at the eastern extremity of the Isle of Mull.

A collection of sketch-stories, including portions of the suppressed &quot;James Merle&quot; were published posthumously as &quot;With the Eyes of Youth, and Other Sketches&quot; (1903).

==Family==

Black&#x27;s first wife, Augustus Wenzel, died on 14 May 1866 of a fever contracted not long after the birth of their son, Martin. They had only been married since 8 April 1865. Martin then died on 29 March 1871.

Black first met his second wife, Eva Simpson, daughter of Wharton Simpson, a fellow journalist and fellow member of Whitefriars Club, in 1869. He saw her again in 1872 and used her as the basis for Bell in &quot;The Phaeton&quot;. They were married in April 1874 and she was still alive when Wemyss Reid, who had offered Black a contributor&#x27;s role on the &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot;, published his biography.

From 1879 until his death, Black lived at 1 Paston Place, Brighton.

==Recognition==
A memorial to Black, in the form of a small castle, was built at Duart Point designed by Glasgow architect William Leiper.
