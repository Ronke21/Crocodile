<text>Activated carbon, also called activated charcoal, is a form of carbon commonly used to filter contaminants from water and air, among many other uses. It is processed (activated) to have small, low-volume pores that greatly increase the surface area available for &quot;adsorption &quot; or chemical reactions. (Adsorption, not to be confused with absorption, is a process where atoms or molecules adhere to a surface). The pores can be thought of as a microscopic &quot;sponge&quot; structure. Activation is analogous to making popcorn from dried corn kernels: popcorn is light, fluffy, and its kernels have a high surface-area-to-volume ratio. &quot;Activated&quot; is sometimes replaced by &quot;active&quot;.

Because it is so porous on a microscopic scale, one gram of activated carbon has a surface area of over , as determined by gas adsorption. Researchers at Cornell University synthesized an ultrahigh surface area activated carbon with a BET area of 4800 m2 g–1. This BET area value is the highest reported in the literature for activated carbon to date. For charcoal, the equivalent figure before activation is about . A useful activation level may be obtained solely from high surface area. Further chemical treatment often enhances adsorption properties.

Activated carbon is usually derived from waste products such as coconut husks; waste from paper mills has been studied as a source. These bulk sources are converted into charcoal before being activated. When derived from coal, it is referred to as activated coal. Activated coke is derived from coke.

==Uses==

Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, capacitive deionization, supercapacitive swing adsorption, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride, edible electronics, and many other applications.

===Industrial===
One major industrial application involves use of activated carbon in metal finishing for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is the main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.

===Medical===

Activated carbon is used to treat poisonings and overdoses following oral ingestion. Tablets or capsules of activated carbon are used in many countries as an over-the-counter drug to treat diarrhea, indigestion, and flatulence. However, activated charcoal shows no effect on intestinal gas and diarrhea, is ordinarily medically ineffective if poisoning resulted from ingestion of corrosive agents, boric acid, or petroleum products, and is particularly ineffective against poisonings of strong acids or bases, cyanide, iron, lithium, arsenic, methanol, ethanol, or ethylene glycol. Activated carbon will not prevent these chemicals from being absorbed into the human body. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

Incorrect application (e.g. into the lungs) results in pulmonary aspiration, which can sometimes be fatal if immediate medical treatment is not initiated.

===Analytical chemistry===
Activated carbon, in 50% w/w combination with celite, is used as stationary phase in low-pressure chromatographic separation of carbohydrates (mono-, di-, tri-saccharides) using ethanol solutions (5–50%) as mobile phase in analytical or preparative protocols.

Activated carbon is useful for extracting the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban from blood plasma samples. For this purpose it has been made into &quot;minitablets&quot;, each containing 5 mg activated carbon for treating 1ml samples of DOAC. Since this activated carbon has no effect on blood clotting factors, heparin or most other anticoagulants this allows a plasma sample to be analyzed for abnormalities otherwise affected by the DOACs.

===Environmental===
Carbon adsorption has numerous applications in removing pollutants from air or water streams both in the field and in industrial processes such as:
* Spill cleanup
* Groundwater remediation
* Drinking water filtration
* Wastewater treatment
* Air purification
* Volatile organic compounds capture from painting, dry cleaning, gasoline dispensing operations, and other processes
* Volatile organic compounds recovery (SRU, Solvent Recovery Unit; SRP, Solvent Recovery Plant; SRS, Solvent Recovery System) from flexible packaging, converting, coating, and other processes.

During early implementation of the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act in the US, EPA officials developed a rule that proposed requiring drinking water treatment systems to use granular activated carbon. Because of its high cost, the so-called GAC rule encountered strong opposition across the country from the water supply industry, including the largest water utilities in California. Hence, the agency set aside the rule. Activated carbon filtration is an effective water treatment method due to its multi-functional nature. There are specific types of activated carbon filtration methods and equipment that are indicated – depending upon the contaminants involved.

Activated carbon is also used for the measurement of radon concentration in air. 

Biomass waste-derived activated carbons were also successfully used for the removal of caffeine and paracetamol from water.

===Agricultural===

Activated carbon (charcoal) is an allowed substance used by organic farmers in both livestock production and wine making. In livestock production it is used as a pesticide, animal feed additive, processing aid, nonagricultural ingredient and disinfectant. In organic winemaking, activated carbon is allowed for use as a processing agent to adsorb brown color pigments from white grape concentrates.
It is sometimes used as biochar.

===Distilled alcoholic beverage purification===

Activated carbon filters (AC filters) can be used to filter vodka and whiskey of organic impurities which can affect color, taste, and odor. Passing an organically impure vodka through an activated carbon filter at the proper flow rate will result in vodka with an identical alcohol content and significantly increased organic purity, as judged by odor and taste.

===Fuel storage===
Research is being done testing various activated carbons&#x27; ability to store natural gas and hydrogen gas. The porous material acts like a sponge for different types of gases. The gas is attracted to the carbon material via Van der Waals forces. Some carbons have been able to achieve binding energies of 5–10 kJ per mol. The gas may then be desorbed when subjected to higher temperatures and either combusted to do work or in the case of hydrogen gas extracted for use in a hydrogen fuel cell. Gas storage in activated carbons is an appealing gas storage method because the gas can be stored in a low pressure, low mass, low volume environment that would be much more feasible than bulky on-board pressure tanks in vehicles. The United States Department of Energy has specified certain goals to be achieved in the area of research and development of nano-porous carbon materials. All of the goals are yet to be satisfied but numerous institutions, including the ALL-CRAFT program, are continuing to conduct work in this field.

===Gas purification===
Filters with activated carbon are usually used in compressed air and gas purification to remove oil vapors, odor, and other hydrocarbons from the air. The most common designs use a 1-stage or 2 stage filtration principle in which activated carbon is embedded inside the filter media.

Activated carbon filters are used to retain radioactive gases within the air vacuumed from a nuclear boiling water reactor turbine condenser. The large charcoal beds adsorb these gases and retain them while they rapidly decay to nonradioactive solid species. The solids are trapped in the charcoal particles, while the filtered air passes through.

===Chemical purification===
Activated carbon is commonly used on the laboratory scale to purify solutions of organic molecules containing unwanted colored organic impurities.

Filtration over activated carbon is used in large scale fine chemical and pharmaceutical processes for the same purpose. The carbon is either mixed with the solution then filtered off or immobilized in a filter.

===Mercury scrubbing===
Activated carbon, often infused with sulfur or iodine, is widely used to trap mercury emissions from coal-fired power stations, medical incinerators, and from natural gas at the wellhead. However, despite its effectiveness, activated carbon is expensive to use.
Since it is often not recycled, the mercury-laden activated carbon presents a disposal dilemma. If the activated carbon contains less than 260 ppm mercury, United States federal regulations allow it to be stabilized (for example, trapped in concrete) for landfilling. However, waste containing greater than 260 ppm is considered to be in the high-mercury subcategory and is banned from landfilling (Land-Ban Rule). This material is now accumulating in warehouses and in deep abandoned mines at an estimated rate of 100 tons per year.

The problem of disposal of mercury-laden activated carbon is not unique to the United States. In the Netherlands, this mercury is largely recovered and the activated carbon is disposed of by complete burning, forming carbon dioxide ().

===Food additive===
Activated, food-grade charcoal became a food trend in 2016, being used as an additive to impart a &quot;slightly smoky&quot; taste and a dark coloring to products including hotdogs, ice cream, pizza bases, and bagels. People taking medication, including birth control pills and antidepressants, are advised to avoid novelty foods or drinks that use activated charcoal coloring since it can render the medication ineffective.

===Smoking filtration===
Activated charcoal is used in smoking filters as a way to reduce the tar content and other chemicals present in smoke, which is a result of combustion, wherein it has been found to reduce the toxicants from tobacco smoke, in particular the free radicals.

==Structure of activated carbon==
The structure of activated carbon has long been a subject of debate. In a book published in 2006, Harry Marsh and Francisco Rodríguez-Reinoso considered more than 15 models for the structure, without coming to a definite conclusion about which was correct. Recent work using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy has suggested that activated carbons may have a structure related to that of the fullerenes, with pentagonal and heptagonal carbon rings. 

==Production==
Activated carbon is carbon produced from carbonaceous source materials such as bamboo, coconut husk, willow peat, wood, coir, lignite, coal, and petroleum pitch. It can be produced (activated) by one of the following processes:
# Physical activation: The source material is developed into activated carbon using hot gases. Air is then introduced to burn out the gasses, creating a graded, screened and de-dusted form of activated carbon. This is generally done by using one or more of the following processes:
#* &quot;Carbonization&quot;: Material with carbon content is pyrolyzed at temperatures in the range 600–900 °C, usually in an inert atmosphere with gases such as argon or nitrogen
#* &quot;Activation/oxidation&quot;: Raw material or carbonized material is exposed to oxidizing atmospheres (oxygen or steam) at temperatures above 250 °C, usually in the temperature range of 600–1200 °C. The activation is performed by heating the sample for 1 h in a muffle furnace at 450 °C in the presence of air.
# Chemical activation: The carbon material is impregnated with certain chemicals. The chemical is typically an acid, strong base, or a salt (phosphoric acid 25%, potassium hydroxide 5%, sodium hydroxide 5%, potassium carbonate 5%, calcium chloride 25%, and zinc chloride 25%). The carbon is then subjected to high temperatures (250–600 °C). It is believed that the temperature activates the carbon at this stage by forcing the material to open up and have more microscopic pores. Chemical activation is preferred to physical activation owing to the lower temperatures, better quality consistency, and shorter time needed for activating the material.

The Dutch company Norit NV, part of the Cabot Corporation, is the largest producer of activated carbon in the world. Haycarb, a Sri Lankan coconut shell-based company, controls 16% of the global market share.

==Classification==
Activated carbons are complex products which are difficult to classify on the basis of their behaviour, surface characteristics and other fundamental criteria. However, some broad classification is made for general purposes based on their size, preparation methods, and industrial applications.

===Powdered activated carbon (PAC)===

Normally, activated carbons (R 1) are made in particulate form as powders or fine granules less than 1.0 mm in size with an average diameter between 0.15 and 0.25 mm. Thus they present a large surface to volume ratio with a small diffusion distance. Activated carbon (R 1) is defined as the activated carbon particles retained on a 50-mesh sieve (0.297 mm).

Powdered activated carbon (PAC) material is finer material. PAC is made up of crushed or ground carbon particles, 95–100% of which will pass through a designated mesh sieve. The ASTM classifies particles passing through an 80-mesh sieve (0.177 mm) and smaller as PAC. It is not common to use PAC in a dedicated vessel, due to the high head loss that would occur. Instead, PAC is generally added directly to other process units, such as raw water intakes, rapid mix basins, clarifiers, and gravity filters.

===Granular activated carbon (GAC)===
Granular activated carbon (GAC) has a relatively larger particle size compared to powdered activated carbon and consequently, presents a smaller external surface. Diffusion of the adsorbate is thus an important factor. These carbons are suitable for adsorption of gases and vapors, because gaseous substances diffuse rapidly. Granulated carbons are used for air filtration and water treatment, as well as for general deodorization and separation of components in flow systems and in rapid mix basins. GAC can be obtained in either granular or extruded form. GAC is designated by sizes such as 8×20, 20×40, or 8×30 for liquid phase applications and 4×6, 4×8 or 4×10 for vapor phase applications. A 20×40 carbon is made of particles that will pass through a U.S. Standard Mesh Size No. 20 sieve (0.84 mm) (generally specified as 85% passing) but be retained on a U.S. Standard Mesh Size No. 40 sieve (0.42 mm) (generally specified as 95% retained). AWWA (1992) B604 uses the 50-mesh sieve (0.297 mm) as the minimum GAC size. The most popular aqueous-phase carbons are the 12×40 and 8×30 sizes because they have a good balance of size, surface area, and head loss characteristics.

===Extruded activated carbon (EAC)===
Extruded activated carbon (EAC) combines powdered activated carbon with a binder, which are fused together and extruded into a cylindrical shaped activated carbon block with diameters from 0.8 to 130 mm. These are mainly used for gas phase applications because of their low pressure drop, high mechanical strength and low dust content. Also sold as CTO filter (Chlorine, Taste, Odor).

===Bead activated carbon (BAC)===
Bead activated carbon (BAC) is made from petroleum pitch and supplied in diameters from approximately 0.35 to 0.80 mm. Similar to EAC, it is also noted for its low pressure drop, high mechanical strength and low dust content, but with a smaller grain size. Its spherical shape makes it preferred for fluidized bed applications such as water filtration.

===Impregnated carbon===
Porous carbons containing several types of inorganic impregnate such as iodine and silver. Cations such as aluminium, manganese, zinc, iron, lithium, and calcium have also been prepared for specific application in air pollution control especially in museums and galleries. Due to its antimicrobial and antiseptic properties, silver loaded activated carbon is used as an adsorbent for purification of domestic water. Drinking water can be obtained from natural water by treating the natural water with a mixture of activated carbon and aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)3), a flocculating agent. Impregnated carbons are also used for the adsorption of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and thiols. Adsorption rates for H2S as high as 50% by weight have been reported. 

===Polymer coated carbon===

This is a process by which a porous carbon can be coated with a biocompatible polymer to give a smooth and permeable coat without blocking the pores. The resulting carbon is useful for hemoperfusion. Hemoperfusion is a treatment technique in which large volumes of the patient&#x27;s blood are passed over an adsorbent substance in order to remove toxic substances from the blood.

===Woven carbon===
There is a technology of processing technical rayon fiber into activated carbon cloth for carbon filtering. Adsorption capacity of activated cloth is greater than that of activated charcoal (BET theory) surface area: 500–1500 m2/g, pore volume: 0.3–0.8 cm3/g). Thanks to the different forms of activated material, it can be used in a wide range of applications (supercapacitors, odor absorbers, CBRN-defense industry etc.).

==Properties==
A gram of activated carbon can have a surface area in excess of , with being readily achievable. Carbon aerogels, while more expensive, have even higher surface areas, and are used in special applications.

Under an electron microscope, the high surface-area structures of activated carbon are revealed. Individual particles are intensely convoluted and display various kinds of porosity; there may be many areas where flat surfaces of graphite-like material run parallel to each other, separated by only a few nanometres or so. These micropores provide superb conditions for adsorption to occur, since adsorbing material can interact with many surfaces simultaneously. Tests of adsorption behaviour are usually done with nitrogen gas at 77 K under high vacuum, but in everyday terms activated carbon is perfectly capable of producing the equivalent, by adsorption from its environment, liquid water from steam at and a pressure of 1/10,000 of an atmosphere.

James Dewar, the scientist after whom the Dewar (vacuum flask) is named, spent much time studying activated carbon and published a paper regarding its adsorption capacity with regard to gases. In this paper, he discovered that cooling the carbon to liquid nitrogen temperatures allowed it to adsorb significant quantities of numerous air gases, among others, that could then be recollected by simply allowing the carbon to warm again and that coconut-based carbon was superior for the effect. He uses oxygen as an example, wherein the activated carbon would typically adsorb the atmospheric concentration (21%) under standard conditions, but release over 80% oxygen if the carbon was first cooled to low temperatures.

Physically, activated carbon binds materials by van der Waals force or London dispersion force.

Activated carbon does not bind well to certain chemicals, including alcohols, diols, strong acids and bases, metals and most inorganics, such as lithium, sodium, iron, lead, arsenic, fluorine, and boric acid.

Activated carbon adsorbs iodine very well. The iodine capacity, mg/g, (ASTM D28 Standard Method test) may be used as an indication of total surface area.

Carbon monoxide is not well adsorbed by activated carbon. This should be of particular concern to those using the material in filters for respirators, fume hoods, or other gas control systems because the gas is undetectable to the human senses, toxic to the metabolism, and neurotoxic.

Substantial lists of the common industrial and agricultural gases adsorbed by activated carbon can be found online.

Activated carbon can be used as a substrate for the application of various chemicals to improve the adsorptive capacity for some inorganic (and problematic organic) compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), formaldehyde (HCOH), mercury (Hg) and radioactive iodine-131(131I). This property is known as chemisorption.

===Iodine number===
Many carbons preferentially adsorb small molecules. Iodine number is the most fundamental parameter used to characterize activated carbon performance.
It is a measure of activity level (higher number indicates higher degree of activation) often reported in mg/g (typical range 500–1200 mg/g).
It is a measure of the micropore content of the activated carbon (0 to 20 Å, or up to 2 nm) by adsorption of iodine from solution.
It is equivalent to surface area of carbon between 900 and 1100 m2/g.
It is the standard measure for liquid-phase applications.

Iodine number is defined as the milligrams of iodine adsorbed by one gram of carbon when the iodine concentration in the residual filtrate is at a concentration of 0.02 normal (i.e. 0.02N). Basically, iodine number is a measure of the iodine adsorbed in the pores and, as such, is an indication of the pore volume available in the activated carbon of interest. Typically, water-treatment carbons have iodine numbers ranging from 600 to 1100. Frequently, this parameter is used to determine the degree of exhaustion of a carbon in use. However, this practice should be viewed with caution, as chemical interactions with the adsorbate may affect the iodine uptake, giving false results. Thus, the use of iodine number as a measure of the degree of exhaustion of a carbon bed can only be recommended if it has been shown to be free of chemical interactions with adsorbates and if an experimental correlation between iodine number and the degree of exhaustion has been determined for the particular application.

===Molasses===
Some carbons are more adept at adsorbing large molecules.
Molasses number or molasses efficiency is a measure of the mesopore content of the activated carbon (greater than 20 Å, or larger than 2 nm) by adsorption of molasses from solution.
A high molasses number indicates a high adsorption of big molecules (range 95–600). Caramel dp (decolorizing performance) is similar to molasses number. Molasses efficiency is reported as a percentage (range 40%–185%) and parallels molasses number (600 = 185%, 425 = 85%).
The European molasses number (range 525–110) is inversely related to the North American molasses number.

Molasses Number is a measure of the degree of decolorization of a standard molasses solution that has been diluted and standardized against standardized activated carbon. Due to the size of color bodies, the molasses number represents the potential pore volume available for larger adsorbing species. As all of the pore volume may not be available for adsorption in a particular waste water application, and as some of the adsorbate may enter smaller pores, it is not a good measure of the worth of a particular activated carbon for a specific application. Frequently, this parameter is useful in evaluating a series of active carbons for their rates of adsorption. Given two active carbons with similar pore volumes for adsorption, the one having the higher molasses number will usually have larger feeder pores resulting in more efficient transfer of adsorbate into the adsorption space.

===Tannin===
Tannins are a mixture of large and medium size molecules.
Carbons with a combination of macropores and mesopores adsorb tannins.
The ability of a carbon to adsorb tannins is reported in parts per million concentration (range 200 ppm–362 ppm).

===Methylene blue===
Some carbons have a mesopore (20 Å to 50 Å, or 2 to 5 nm) structure which adsorbs medium size molecules, such as the dye methylene blue.
Methylene blue adsorption is reported in g/100g (range 11–28 g/100g).

===Dechlorination===
Some carbons are evaluated based on the dechlorination half-life length, which measures the chlorine-removal efficiency of activated carbon. The dechlorination half-value length is the depth of carbon required to reduce the chlorine concentration by 50%. A lower half-value length indicates superior performance.

===Apparent density===
The solid or skeletal density of activated carbons will typically range between 2000 and 2100 kg/m3 (125–130 lbs./cubic foot). However, a large part of an activated carbon sample will consist of air space between particles, and the actual or apparent density will therefore be lower, typically 400 to 500 kg/m3 (25–31 lbs./cubic foot).

Higher density provides greater volume activity and normally indicates better-quality activated carbon.
ASTM D 2854 -09 (2014) is used to determine the apparent density of activated carbon.

===Hardness/abrasion number===
It is a measure of the activated carbon&#x27;s resistance to attrition.
It is an important indicator of activated carbon to maintain its physical integrity and withstand frictional forces. There are large differences in the hardness of activated carbons, depending on the raw material and activity levels (porosity).

===Ash content===
Ash reduces the overall activity of activated carbon and reduces the efficiency of reactivation. The amount is exclusively dependent on the base raw material used to produce the activated carbon (e.g., coconut, wood, coal, etc.).
The metal oxides (Fe2O3) can leach out of activated carbon resulting in discoloration. Acid/water-soluble ash content is more significant than total ash content. Soluble ash content can be very important for aquarists, as ferric oxide can promote algal growths. A carbon with a low soluble ash content should be used for marine, freshwater fish and reef tanks to avoid heavy metal poisoning and excess plant/algal growth.
ASTM (D2866 Standard Method test) is used to determine the ash content of activated carbon.

===Carbon tetrachloride activity===
Measurement of the porosity of an activated carbon by the adsorption of saturated carbon tetrachloride vapour.

===Particle size distribution===
The finer the particle size of an activated carbon, the better the access to the surface area and the faster the rate of adsorption kinetics. In vapour phase systems this needs to be considered against pressure drop, which will affect energy cost. Careful consideration of particle size distribution can provide significant operating benefits.
However, in the case of using activated carbon for adsorption of minerals such as gold, the particle size should be in the range of . Activated carbon with particle size less than 1 mm would not be suitable for elution (the stripping of mineral from an activated carbon). Researchers at Cornell University synthesized an ultrahigh surface area activated carbon with a BET area of 4800 m2 g–1 and a total pore volume of 2.7 cm3 g–1. This BET area value is the highest reported in the literature for activated carbon to date.

==Modification of properties and reactivity==
Acid-base, oxidation-reduction and specific adsorption characteristics are strongly dependent on the composition of the surface functional groups.

The surface of conventional activated carbon is reactive, capable of oxidation by atmospheric oxygen and oxygen plasma steam, and also carbon dioxide and ozone.

Oxidation in the liquid phase is caused by a wide range of reagents (HNO3, H2O2, KMnO4).

Through the formation of a large number of basic and acidic groups on the surface of oxidized carbon to sorption and other properties can differ significantly from the unmodified forms.

Activated carbon can be nitrogenated by natural products or polymers or processing of carbon with nitrogenating reagents.

Activated carbon can interact with chlorine, bromine and fluorine.

Surface of activated carbon, like other carbon materials can be fluoralkylated by treatment with (per)fluoropolyether peroxide in a liquid phase, or with wide range of fluoroorganic substances by CVD-method. Such materials combine high hydrophobicity and chemical stability with electrical and thermal conductivity and can be used as electrode material for super capacitors.

Sulfonic acid functional groups can be attached to activated carbon to give &quot;starbons&quot; which can be used to selectively catalyse the esterification of fatty acids. Formation of such activated carbons from halogenated precursors gives a more effective catalyst which is thought to be a result of remaining halogens improving stability. It is reported about synthesis of activated carbon with chemically grafted superacid sites –CF2SO3H.

Some of the chemical properties of activated carbon have been attributed to presence of the surface active carbon double bond.

The Polyani adsorption theory is a popular method for analyzing adsorption of various organic substances to their surface.

==Examples of adsorption==

===Heterogeneous catalysis===
The most commonly encountered form of chemisorption in industry, occurs when a solid catalyst interacts with a gaseous feedstock, the reactant/s. The adsorption of reactant/s to the catalyst surface creates a chemical bond, altering the electron density around the reactant molecule and allowing it to undergo reactions that would not normally be available to it.

==Reactivation and regeneration==
The reactivation or the regeneration of activated carbons involves restoring the adsorptive capacity of saturated activated carbon by desorbing adsorbed contaminants on the activated carbon surface.

===Thermal reactivation===
The most common regeneration technique employed in industrial processes is thermal reactivation. The thermal regeneration process generally follows three steps:
* Adsorbent drying at approximately 
* High temperature desorption and decomposition () under an inert atmosphere
* Residual organic gasification by a non-oxidising gas (steam or carbon dioxide) at elevated temperatures ()

The heat treatment stage utilises the exothermic nature of adsorption and results in desorption, partial cracking and polymerization of the adsorbed organics. The final step aims to remove charred organic residue formed in the porous structure in the previous stage and re-expose the porous carbon structure regenerating its original surface characteristics. After treatment the adsorption column can be reused. Per adsorption-thermal regeneration cycle between 5–15 wt% of the carbon bed is burnt off resulting in a loss of adsorptive capacity. Thermal regeneration is a high energy process due to the high required temperatures making it both an energetically and commercially expensive process. Plants that rely on thermal regeneration of activated carbon have to be of a certain size before it is economically viable to have regeneration facilities onsite. As a result, it is common for smaller waste treatment sites to ship their activated carbon cores to specialised facilities for regeneration.

===Other regeneration techniques===
Current concerns with the high energy/cost nature of thermal regeneration of activated carbon has encouraged research into alternative regeneration methods to reduce the environmental impact of such processes. Though several of the regeneration techniques cited have remained areas of purely academic research, some alternatives to thermal regeneration systems have been employed in industry. Current alternative regeneration methods are:
* TSA (thermal swing adsorption) and/or PSA (pressure swing adsorption) processes: through convection (heat transfer) using steam, &quot;hot&quot; inert gas (typically heated nitrogen (150–250 °C (302–482 °F))), or vacuum (T+VSA or TVSA, combining TSA and VSA processes) in situ regeneration
* MWR (microwave regeneration)
* Chemical and solvent regeneration
* Microbial regeneration
* Electrochemical regeneration
* Ultrasonic regeneration
* Wet air oxidation

<text>Edward Frank Limato (July 10, 1936 – July 3, 2010) was an American talent agent and a senior vice president at the William Morris Agency, representing clients such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Nicolas Cage, Mel Gibson, Steve Martin, Diana Ross, Richard Gere, and Denzel Washington. Before coming to WMA, Limato was a partner and co-president at International Creative Management for more than a decade, from 1988 to 1999.

==Life and career==
Limato grew up in a working-class Italian family in Mount Vernon, New York. He worked as a disc jockey and traveled to Europe, where he got a job as assistant to Franco Zeffirelli. Zeffirelli&#x27;s agent helped Limato get a mailroom job at Ashley-Famous Agency in New York. That agency eventually merged to become International Creative Management (ICM).

Limato transferred to Los Angeles, and he eventually moved to the William Morris Agency. He later returned to ICM, rising to co-president. He sued ICM in 2007 after they tried to move him to an &quot;emeritus&quot; position. Limato prevailed in the case and returned to William Morris with his clients.

Limato was on the board of directors at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. He also served on the boards of the Los Angeles Conservancy, American Cinematheque, and the Motion Picture and Television Fund. Limato died of emphysema complicated by pneumonia in his home in 2010, just one week short of his 74th birthday.

==Legacy==
Both the 2010 film &quot;Unstoppable&quot; and the 2012 film &quot;Flight&quot; include dedications to Limato.

The 2020 documentary &quot;P.S. Burn This Letter Please&quot; is based on a cache of hundreds of letters written to Limato, using his earlier radio presenter air name Reno Martin, and unearthed in a Los Angeles storage unit in 2014. The letters, dating back to the 1950s, are from some of Limato&#x27;s closest friends, many of whom were drag queens in New York City. The letters represent &quot;important written documents for drag queen history since most of these types of letters were destroyed out of fear.&quot;

<doc id="395385" wikidata="Q4806125" url="?curid=395385" title="ICM Partners">
<text>ICM Partners was a talent and literary agency with offices in Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C., and London. The company represented clients in the fields of motion pictures, television, music, publishing, live performance, branded entertainment and new media. Its corporate headquarters were in Constellation Place in Century City, Los Angeles. In 2022, ICM became part of Creative Artists Agency.

==History==
=== Formation and growth ===
International Creative Management was formed in 1975 through the merger of Marvin Josephson&#x27;s International Famous Agency and Freddie Fields&#x27; Creative Management Associates (CMA). ICM&#x27;s first president was Freddie Fields, although he didn&#x27;t last long in the role. Other important figures in the merger were Sam Cohn and Guy McElwaine of CMA.

In 1985, ICM acquired London-based talent agency Duncan Heath Associates, which in 1991 merged with ICM London, with Heath became chairman of the merged company.
&quot;In 1992, Josephson passed control of ICM onto Jeff Berg, Sam Cohn, and Jim Wiatt, though Josephson maintained a leadership role and continued to represent personal clients.&quot;

In 2005, the company raised a financing round of $75 million from Rizvi Traverse.

In 2006, ICM acquired the literary agency Broder Webb Chervin Silbermann.

=== ICM Partners ===
In 2012, the agency completed a management buyout and formed a partnership with the new name, ICM Partners.

In March 2018, ICM acquired the Just For Laughs comedy festival, as part of a partnership with Howie Mandel. A 51% majority was later sold to Bell Media and Groupe CH to maintain a primarily-Canadian ownership. In June that year, ICM formed a partnership with esports-focused talent agency Evolved.

In December 2019, ICM Partners sold a one-third equity stake in the company to Crestview Partners, with the expressed goal to grow the company within the representation business with an emphasis on International growth.

In March 2020, ICM partnered with Primary Talent International, a London-based music touring agency with over 700 touring clients. In August, they bought a significant minority interest in Albatros, a literary agency based in Stockholm and moved partner Pete Stone to Sweden to run ICM Europe. In October, the agency purchased Stellar Group, the largest football/soccer agency in the world and rebranded it ICM Stellar Sports. (Stellar Group CEO Jonathan Barnett was listed by Forbes as the No. 1 sports agent in the world by Forbes magazine in 2019.)

In July 2021, ICM Partners and ICM Stellar Sports purchased one of the leading NFL representation agencies, Select Sports Group, a Texas based company headed up by Jeff Nalley and Erik Burkhardt.

=== Acquisition by CAA ===
In September 2021, it was announced that ICM would be acquired by Creative Artists Agency (CAA). The deal closed in June 2022 at a value of $750 million. Following the acquisition, 105 positions from ICM were set to be eliminated, with about 425 staffers and agents joining CAA.

==Departments==
===Television and movies===
ICM Partners&#x27; television and motion picture departments represented film actors, actresses, directors and writers. The departments also featured a division dedicated to production professionals such as cinematographers, editors, second unit directors, composers, production designers, costume designers and visual effects supervisors. The television department also represented on-air and creative talent.&quot;&quot;

===Publishing===
ICM Partners represented writers and editors including Patricia Cornwell, Thomas Friedman, Anna Quindlen, E.L. Doctorow, Walter Isaacson, Carl Hiaasen, Tom Bissell, Anthony Swofford, Chris Cleave, Candace Bushnell, John Feinstein, Ann Patchett, Carol Higgins Clark and Steve Martin. In addition, the agency represents the estates of Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), Arthur Miller, E.B. White, and Tennessee Williams, among others.

===Music, comedy, and lectures===
ICM Partners&#x27; concert and live appearances department represented artists in music and comedy as well as lecturers. ICM Partners acquired New York City speakers agency Royce Carlton, Inc. in 2017. From the acquisition until late 2019, the lecture division still went by the Royce Carlton name. On October 16, 2019, the division rebranded to ICM Speakers and relocated to the Washington, D.C., office. ICM Speakers&#x27; division services included the management and representation of professional public speakers. A few notable clients included author Mitch Albom, author Jon Meacham, TV host Karamo Brown, and activist Nadia Murad.

===Branded entertainment===
ICM Partners&#x27; global branded entertainment division&#x27;s services ranged from celebrity endorsements, product placement, and music tour sponsorship&lt;ref name=&quot;R&amp;B/Hip-Hop, Jazz, Pop Briefs: Beyonce, Freddie Hubbard, Will Downing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to brand integration, such as the creation and packaging of original branded films and television shows. The agency&#x27;s celebrity endorsements department serviced all ICM Partners&#x27; film and television talent for on-camera, print and voiceover commercial work as well as for paid media campaigns.

<text>In computing, the Common Public License (CPL) is a free software / open-source software license published by IBM. The Free Software Foundation and Open Source Initiative have approved the license terms of the CPL.

==Definition==
The CPL has the stated aims of supporting and encouraging collaborative open-source development while still retaining the ability to use the CPL&#x27;d content with software licensed under other licenses, including many proprietary licenses. The Eclipse Public License (EPL) consists of a slightly modified version of the CPL.

The CPL has some terms that resemble those of the GNU General Public License (GPL), but some key differences exist. A similarity relates to distribution of a modified computer program: under either license (CPL or GPL), one must make the source code of a modified program available to others.

CPL, like the GNU Lesser General Public License, allows non-CPL-licensed software to link to a library under CPL without requiring the linked source code to be made available to the licensee.

CPL lacks compatibility with both versions of the GPL because it has a &quot;choice of law&quot; section in section 7, which restricts legal disputes to a certain court. Another source of incompatibility is the differing copyleft requirements.

To reduce the number of open source licenses, IBM and Eclipse Foundation agreed upon using solely the Eclipse Public License in the future. Open Source Initiative therefore lists the Common Public License as deprecated and superseded by EPL.

==Projects using the Common Public License==
* Microsoft has released its Windows Installer XML (WiX) developer tool, Windows Template Library (WTL) and the FlexWiki engine under the CPL as SourceForge projects.
* Some projects of the COIN-OR Foundation use the CPL.

<text>In topology, a subbase (or subbasis, prebase, prebasis) for a topological space formula_1 with topology formula_2 is a subcollection formula_3 of formula_2 that generates formula_5 in the sense that formula_2 is the smallest topology containing formula_3 as open sets. A slightly different definition is used by some authors, and there are other useful equivalent formulations of the definition; these are discussed below.

==Definition==

Let formula_1 be a topological space with topology formula_9 A subbase of formula_2 is usually defined as a subcollection formula_3 of formula_2 satisfying one of the two following equivalent conditions:

#The subcollection formula_3 &quot;generates&quot; the topology formula_9 This means that formula_2 is the smallest topology containing formula_3: any topology formula_17 on formula_1 containing formula_3 must also contain formula_9
#The collection of open sets consisting of all finite intersections of elements of formula_3 forms a basis for formula_9 This means that every proper open set in formula_2 can be written as a union of finite intersections of elements of formula_24 Explicitly, given a point formula_25 in an open set formula_26 there are finitely many sets formula_27 of formula_28 such that the intersection of these sets contains formula_25 and is contained in formula_30

(If we use the nullary intersection convention, then there is no need to include formula_1 in the second definition.)

For subcollection formula_32 of the power set formula_33 there is a unique topology having formula_32 as a subbase. In particular, the intersection of all topologies on formula_1 containing formula_32 satisfies this condition. In general, however, there is no unique subbasis for a given topology.

Thus, we can start with a fixed topology and find subbases for that topology, and we can also start with an arbitrary subcollection of the power set formula_37 and form the topology generated by that subcollection. We can freely use either equivalent definition above; indeed, in many cases, one of the two conditions is more useful than the other.

===Alternative definition===

Less commonly, a slightly different definition of subbase is given which requires that the subbase formula_38 cover formula_39 In this case, formula_1 is the union of all sets contained in formula_41 This means that there can be no confusion regarding the use of nullary intersections in the definition.

However, this definition is not always equivalent to the two definitions above. There exist topological spaces formula_42 with subcollections formula_43 of the topology such that formula_2 is the smallest topology containing formula_38, yet formula_38 does not cover formula_1. (An example is given at the end of the next section.) In practice, this is a rare occurrence. E.g. a subbase of a space that has at least two points and satisfies the T1 separation axiom must be a cover of that space. But as seen below, to prove the Alexander subbase theorem, one must assume that formula_38 covers formula_39 

==Examples==

The topology generated by any subset formula_50 (including by the empty set formula_51) is equal to the trivial topology formula_52

If formula_2 is a topology on formula_1 and formula_38 is a basis for formula_2 then the topology generated by formula_38 is formula_9 Thus any basis formula_38 for a topology formula_2 is also a subbasis for formula_9 
If formula_62 is any subset of formula_2 then the topology generated by formula_62 will be a subset of formula_9

The usual topology on the real numbers formula_66 has a subbase consisting of all semi-infinite open intervals either of the form formula_67 or formula_68 where formula_69 and formula_70 are real numbers. Together, these generate the usual topology, since the intersections formula_71 for formula_72 generate the usual topology. A second subbase is formed by taking the subfamily where formula_69 and formula_70 are rational. The second subbase generates the usual topology as well, since the open intervals formula_75 with formula_76 formula_70 rational, are a basis for the usual Euclidean topology.

The subbase consisting of all semi-infinite open intervals of the form formula_67 alone, where formula_69 is a real number, does not generate the usual topology. The resulting topology does not satisfy the T1 separation axiom, since if formula_80 every open set containing formula_70 also contains formula_82

The initial topology on formula_1 defined by a family of functions formula_84 where each formula_85 has a topology, is the coarsest topology on formula_1 such that each formula_87 is continuous. Because continuity can be defined in terms of the inverse images of open sets, this means that the initial topology on formula_1 is given by taking all formula_89
where formula_90 ranges over all open subsets of formula_91 as a subbasis.

Two important special cases of the initial topology are the product topology, where the family of functions is the set of projections from the product to each factor, and the subspace topology, where the family consists of just one function, the inclusion map.

The compact-open topology on the space of continuous functions from formula_1 to formula_93 has for a subbase the set of functions
formula_94
where formula_95 is compact and formula_90 is an open subset of formula_97

Suppose that formula_42 is a Hausdorff topological space with formula_1 containing two or more elements (for example, formula_100 with the Euclidean topology). Let formula_101 be any non-empty subset of formula_42 (for example, formula_93 could be a non-empty bounded open interval in formula_66) and let formula_105 denote the subspace topology on formula_93 that formula_93 inherits from formula_42 (so formula_109). Then the topology generated by formula_105 on formula_1 is equal to the union formula_112 (see the footnote for an explanation),

where formula_113 (since formula_42 is Hausdorff, equality will hold if and only if formula_115). Note that if formula_93 is a proper subset of formula_117 then formula_112 is the smallest topology &quot;on formula_1&quot; containing formula_105 yet formula_105 does not cover formula_1 (that is, the union formula_123 is a proper subset of formula_1).

==Results using subbases==

One nice fact about subbases is that continuity of a function need only be checked on a subbase of the range. That is, if formula_125 is a map between topological spaces and if formula_38 is a subbase for formula_127 then formula_125 is continuous if and only if formula_129 is open in formula_1 for every formula_131 
A net (or sequence) formula_132 converges to a point formula_25 if and only if every basic neighborhood of formula_25 contains all formula_135 for sufficiently large formula_136

===Alexander subbase theorem===

The Alexander Subbase Theorem is a significant result concerning subbases that is due to James Waddell Alexander II. The corresponding result for basic (rather than subbasic) open covers is much easier to prove.

:Alexander subbase theorem: Let formula_42 be a topological space. If formula_1 has a subbasis formula_62 such that every cover of formula_1 by elements from formula_62 has a finite subcover, then formula_1 is compact.

The converse to this theorem also holds and it is proven by using formula_143 (since every topology is a subbasis for itself). 
:If formula_1 is compact and formula_62 is a subbasis for formula_117 every cover of formula_1 by elements from formula_62 has a finite subcover.
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that the space formula_1 is not compact (so formula_1 is an infinite set), yet every subbasic cover from formula_62 has a finite subcover. 
Let formula_152 denote the set of all open covers of formula_1 that do not have any finite subcover of formula_39 
Partially order formula_152 by subset inclusion and use Zorn&#x27;s Lemma to find an element formula_156 that is a maximal element of formula_157 
Observe that:

# Since formula_158 by definition of formula_159 formula_160 is an open cover of formula_1 and there does not exist any finite subset of formula_160 that covers formula_1 (so in particular, formula_160 is infinite).
# The maximality of formula_160 in formula_152 implies that if formula_167 is an open set of formula_1 such that formula_169 then formula_170 has a finite subcover, which must necessarily be of the form formula_171 for some finite subset formula_172 of formula_160 (this finite subset depends on the choice of formula_167).

We will begin by showing that formula_175 is a cover of formula_39 
Suppose that formula_175 was a cover of formula_117 which in particular implies that formula_175 is a cover of formula_1 by elements of formula_181 
The theorem&#x27;s hypothesis on formula_62 implies that there exists a finite subset of formula_175 that covers formula_117 which would simultaneously also be a finite subcover of formula_1 by elements of formula_160 (since formula_187). 
But this contradicts formula_158 which proves that formula_175 does not cover formula_39

Since formula_175 does not cover formula_117 there exists some formula_193 that is not covered by formula_175 (that is, formula_25 is not contained in any element of formula_175). 
But since formula_160 does cover formula_117 there also exists some formula_199 such that formula_200 
Since formula_62 is a subbasis generating formula_1&#x27;s topology, from the definition of the topology generated by formula_203 there must exist a finite collection of subbasic open sets formula_204 such that
formula_205

We will now show by contradiction that formula_206 for every formula_207 
If formula_208 was such that formula_209 then also formula_210 so the fact that formula_211 would then imply that formula_25 is covered by formula_213 which contradicts how formula_25 was chosen (recall that formula_25 was chosen specifically so that it was not covered by formula_175).

As mentioned earlier, the maximality of formula_160 in formula_152 implies that for every formula_219 there exists a finite subset formula_220 of formula_160 such thatformula_222 forms a finite cover of formula_39 
Define
formula_224
which is a finite subset of formula_225 
Observe that for every formula_219 formula_227 is a finite cover of formula_1 so let us replace every formula_220 with formula_230

Let formula_231 denote the union of all sets in formula_232 (which is an open subset of formula_1) and let formula_234 denote the complement of formula_231 in formula_39 
Observe that for any subset formula_237 formula_238 covers formula_1 if and only if formula_240 
In particular, for every formula_219 the fact that formula_227 covers formula_1 implies that formula_244 
Since formula_208 was arbitrary, we have formula_246 
Recalling that formula_247 we thus have formula_248 which is equivalent to formula_249 being a cover of formula_39 
Moreover, formula_249 is a finite cover of formula_1 with formula_253 
Thus formula_160 has a finite subcover of formula_117 which contradicts the fact that formula_256 
Therefore, the original assumption that formula_1 is not compact must be wrong, which proves that formula_1 is compact. formula_259
Although this proof makes use of Zorn&#x27;s Lemma, the proof does not need the full strength of choice. 
Instead, it relies on the intermediate Ultrafilter principle.

Using this theorem with the subbase for formula_66 above, one can give a very easy proof that bounded closed intervals in formula_66 are compact. 
More generally, Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, which states that the product of non-empty compact spaces is compact, has a short proof if the Alexander Subbase Theorem is used.
The product topology on formula_262 has, by definition, a subbase consisting of &quot;cylinder&quot; sets that are the inverse projections of an open set in one factor. 
Given a family formula_263 of the product that does not have a finite subcover, we can partition formula_264 into subfamilies that consist of exactly those cylinder sets corresponding to a given factor space. 
By assumption, if formula_265 then formula_266 does have a finite subcover. 
Being cylinder sets, this means their projections onto formula_267 have no finite subcover, and since each formula_267 is compact, we can find a point formula_269 that is not covered by the projections of formula_266 onto formula_271 But then formula_272 is not covered by formula_273 formula_259

Note, that in the last step we implicitly used the axiom of choice (which is actually equivalent to Zorn&#x27;s lemma) to ensure the existence of formula_275

<text>DNA primase is an enzyme involved in the replication of DNA and is a type of RNA polymerase. Primase catalyzes the synthesis of a short RNA (or DNA in some 
living organisms) segment called a primer complementary to a ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) template. After this elongation, the RNA piece is removed by a 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; exonuclease and refilled with DNA.

== Function ==

In bacteria, primase binds to the DNA helicase forming a complex called the primosome. Primase is activated by the helicase where it then synthesizes a short RNA primer approximately 11 ±1 nucleotides long, to which new nucleotides can be added by DNA polymerase. Archaeal and eukaryote primases are heterodimeric proteins with one large regulatory and one minuscule catalytic subunit.

The RNA segments are first synthesized by primase and then elongated by DNA polymerase. Then the DNA polymerase forms a protein complex with two primase subunits to form the alpha DNA Polymerase primase complex. Primase is one of the most error prone and slow polymerases. Primases in organisms such as &quot;E. coli&quot; synthesize around 2000 to 3000 primers at the rate of one primer per second. Primase also acts as a halting mechanism to prevent the leading strand from outpacing the lagging strand by halting the progression of the replication fork. The rate determining step in primase is when the first phosphodiester bond is formed between two molecules of RNA.

The replication mechanisms differ between different bacteria and viruses where the primase covalently link to helicase in viruses such as the T7 bacteriophage. In viruses such as the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), primase can form complexes with helicase. The primase-helicase complex is used to unwind dsDNA (double-stranded) and synthesizes the lagging strand using RNA primers The majority of primers synthesized by primase are two to three nucleotides long.

== Types ==
There are two main types of primase: DnaG found in most bacteria, and the AEP (Archaeo-Eukaryote Primase) superfamily found in archaean and eukaryotic primases. While bacterial primases (DnaG-type) are composed of a single protein unit (a monomer) and synthesize RNA primers, AEP primases are usually composed of two different primase units (a heterodimer) and synthesize two-part primers with both RNA and DNA components. While functionally similar, the two primase superfamilies evolved independently of each other.

=== DnaG ===
The crystal structure of primase in &quot;E. coli&quot; with a core containing the DnaG protein was determined in the year 2000. The DnaG and primase complex is cashew shaped and contains three subdomains. The central subdomain forms a toprim fold which is made of a mixture five beta sheets and six alpha helices. The toprim fold is used for binding regulators and metals. The primase uses a phosphotransfer domain for the transfer coordination of metals, which makes it distinct from other polymerases. The side subunits contain a NH2 and COOH-terminal made of alpha helixes and beta sheets. The NH2 terminal interacts with a zinc binding domain and COOH-terminal region which interacts with DnaB-ID.

The Toprim fold is also found in topoisomerase and mitochrondrial Twinkle primase/helicase. Some DnaG-like (bacteria-like; ) primases have been found in archaeal genomes.

=== AEP ===
Eukaryote and archaeal primases tend to be more similar to each other, in terms of structure and mechanism, than they are to bacterial primases. The archaea-eukaryotic primase (AEP) superfamily, which most eukaryal and archaeal primase catalytic subunits belong to, has recently been redefined as a primase-polymerase family in recognition of the many other roles played by enzymes in this family. This classification also emphasizes the broad origins of AEP primases; the superfamily is now recognized as transitioning between RNA and DNA functions.

Archaeal and eukaryote primases are heterodimeric proteins with one large regulatory (human PRIM2, p58) and one small catalytic subunit (human PRIM1, p48/p49). The large subunit contains a N-terminal 4Fe–4S cluster, split out in some archaea as PriX/PriCT. The large subunit is implicated in improving the activity and specificity of the small subunit. For example, removing the part corresponding to the large subunit in a fusion protein PolpTN2 results in a slower enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity.

== Multifunctional primases ==
The AEP family of primase-polymerases has diverse features beyond making only primers. In addition to priming DNA during replication, AEP enzymes may have additional functions in the DNA replication process, such as polymerization of DNA or RNA, terminal transfer, translesion synthesis (TLS), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and possibly in restarting stalled replication forks. Primases typically synthesize primers from ribonucleotides (NTPs); however, primases with polymerase capabilities also have an affinity for deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs). Primases with terminal transferase functionality are capable of adding nucleotides to the 3’ end of a DNA strand independently of a template. Other enzymes involved in DNA replication, such as helicases, may also exhibit primase activity.

===In eukaryotes and archaea===

Human PrimPol (ccdc111) serves both primase and polymerase functions, like many archaeal primases; exhibits terminal transferase activity in the presence of manganese; and plays a significant role in translesion synthesis and in restarting stalled replication forks. PrimPol is actively recruited to damaged sites through its interaction with RPA, an adapter protein that facilitates DNA replication and repair. PrimPol has a zinc finger domain similar to that of some viral primases, which is essential for translesion synthesis and primase activity and may regulate primer length. Unlike most primases, PrimPol is uniquely capable of starting DNA chains with dNTPs.

PriS, the archaeal primase small subunit, has a role in translesion synthesis (TLS) and can bypass common DNA lesions. Most archaea lack the specialized polymerases that perform TLS in eukaryotes and bacteria. PriS alone preferentially synthesizes strings of DNA; but in combination with PriL, the large subunit, RNA polymerase activity is increased.

In &quot;Sulfolobus solfataricus&quot;, the primase heterodimer PriSL can act as a primase, polymerase, and terminal transferase. PriSL is thought to initiate primer synthesis with NTPs and then switch to dNTPs. The enzyme can polymerize RNA or DNA chains, with DNA products reaching as long as 7000 nucleotides (7 kb). It is suggested that this dual functionality may be a common feature of archaeal primases.

===In bacteria===

AEP multifunctional primases also appear in bacteria and phages that infect them. They can display novel domain organizations with domains that bring even more functions beyond polymerization.

Bacterial LigD () is primarily involved in the NHEJ pathway. It has an AEP superfamily polymerase/primase domain, a 3&#x27;-phosphoesterase domain, and a ligase domain. It is also capable of primase, DNA and RNA polymerase, and terminal transferase activity. DNA polymerization activity can produce chains over 7000 nucleotides (7 kb) in length, while RNA polymerization produces chains up to 1 kb long.

=== In viruses and plasmids ===
AEP enzymes are widespread, and can be found encoded in mobile genetic elements including virus/phages and plasmids. They either use them as a sole replication protein or in combination with other replication-associated proteins, such as helicases and, less frequently, DNA polymerases. Whereas the presence of AEP in eukaryotic and archaeal viruses is expected in that they mirror their hosts, bacterial viruses and plasmids also as frequently encode AEP-superfamily enzymes as they do DnaG-family primases. A great diversity of AEP families has been uncovered in various bacterial plasmids by comparative genomics surveys. Their evolutionary history is currently unknown, as these found in bacteria and bacteriophages appear too different from their archaeo-eukaryotic homologs for a recent horizontal gene transfer.

MCM-like helicase in &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot; strain ATCC 14579 (BcMCM; ) is an SF6 helicase fused with an AEP primase. The enzyme has both primase and polymerase functions in addition to helicase function. The gene coding for it is found in a prophage. It bears homology to ORF904 of plasmid pRN1 from &quot;Sulfolobus islandicus&quot;, which has an AEP PrimPol domain. Vaccinia virus D5 and HSV Primase are examples of AEP-helicase fusion as well.

PolpTN2 is an Archaeal primase found in the TN2 plasmid. A fusion of domains homologous to PriS and PriL, it exhibits both primase and DNA polymerase activity, as well as terminal transferase function. Unlike most primases, PolpTN2 forms primers composed exclusively of dNTPs. Unexpectedly, when the PriL-like domain was truncated, PolpTN2 could also synthesize DNA on the RNA template, i.e., acted as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase).

Even DnaG primases can have extra functions, if given the right domains. The T7 phage gp4 is a DnaG primase-helicase fusion, and performs both functions in replication.

<doc id="395408" wikidata="Q5179017" url="?curid=395408" title="Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans">
<text>The Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans (abbr: CUUPS) is an independent affiliate of Unitarian Universalists who identify with the precepts of classical or contemporary Paganism: celebrating the sacred circle of life and guiding people to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature. CUUPS members foster the development of &quot;liturgical materials based on earth- and nature-centered religious and spiritual perspectives&quot; as well as encourage &quot;greater use of music, dance, visual arts, poetry, story, and creative ritual in Unitarian Universalist worship and celebration.&quot; Many members of CUUPS embrace the cycle of seasons and beauty of all life forms found in nature. Unlike many mainline religious sects, Unitarian Universalists and Pagans both value the &quot;sacredness in the present world rather than on an afterlife.&quot; CUUPS is a community open to all Unitarian Universalist members and those who support the tenets.

==History==
The history of Unitarian Universalist Paganism started ten years before the founding of CUUPS. In 1977, the Unitarian Universalist general assembly passed the Women and Religion Resolution as a commitment to responding to concerns about patriarchal norms within the association. Some members were searching for a more goddess-based alternative to the traditional, masculine deity. The first Unitarian Universalist Pagan worship service was held in 1980 in East Lansing, Michigan.

In 1985, CUUPS was formed at the UUA General Assembly in Atlanta, Georgia. It was chartered by the UUA in 1987 and incorporated as a not for profit organization in 1997. Thanks to the UUP, a Sixth Source was adopted by the UU General Assembly in 1995. This Sixth Source encompasses: &quot;Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.&quot;

Ecofeminist and neopagan Starhawk has been a pivotal advocate for CUUPS. She was influential in the Unitarian Universalist Association to include nature-centered traditions among their sources of faith. As an author and contributor to thirteen books, Starhawk has broadened Pagan theology. She led numerous workshops for, and was an active member of CUUPS.

CUUPS was an independent affiliate of the Unitarian Universalist Association until 2007, then a related organization, and as of 2015 a Covenanting Community of the UUA. There are now over 110 chapters of CUUPS.

== Bylaws ==
The Bylaws of CUUPS include its affiliation with the UUA, statement of purpose, membership requirements, information on the board of trustees, financial administration, rules for amendments, and rules. The board consists of between three and thirteen members, with a three-year term, must meet quarterly, and the president may not serve more than two terms consecutively. The bylaws were approved in 2014, with revisions last approved in 2017.

==Purpose==
According to Article III of the bylaws, the exact purpose of CUUPS is to promote &quot;the practice and understanding of Pagan and Earth-centered spirituality within the Unitarian Universalist Association, enabling networking among Pagan-identified Unitarian Universalists, providing for the outreach of Unitarian Universalism to the broader Pagan community, providing educational materials on Paganism and Earth-centered spirituality for Unitarian Universalist congregations and for the general public, promoting interfaith dialogue, encouraging the development of theological and liturgical materials based on Pagan and Earth-centered religious and spiritual perspectives, encouraging greater use of music, dance, visual arts, poetry, story and creative ritual in Unitarian Universalist worship and celebration, providing a place or places for gathering and for worship, and fostering healing relationships with the Earth and all of the Earth&#x27;s children.&quot;

The CUUPS mission is to collaborate with the UU six sources and seven principles, with particular focus on the sixth source. CUUPS functions as a networking community of UU Pagans and other nature-based spiritualities. While not directly related to Wicca or other explicit Pagan paths, it does embrace them within its ministerial tradition. Members and friends receive the online CUUPS Bulletin, which reports continental and local chapter activities and explores contemporary Paganism. The organization maintains ties to the UK-based Unitarian Earth Spirit Network, which serves a similar role of representing contemporary Pagan spirituality in the British Unitarian community.

== Principles ==
The following is an affirmed covenant from Unitarian Universalist Associations:

* The inherent worth and dignity of every person.
* Justice, equity and compassion in human relations. 
* Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations. 
* Free and responsible search for truth and meaning 
* The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large. 
* The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all. 
* Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part. &quot;The living tradition we share draws from many sources:
* Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life 
* Words and deeds of prophetic women and men which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love  
* Wisdom from the world&#x27;s religions which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life. 
* Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God&#x27;s love by loving our neighbors as ourselves. 
* Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit.
* Spiritual teachings of Earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature

<text>Hastings County is a county and census division of the Canadian province of Ontario. Geographically, it is located on the border of Eastern Ontario and Central Ontario. Hastings County is the second-largest county in Ontario, after Renfrew County. Its county seat is Belleville, which is, along with Quinte West, independent of Hastings County.

Hastings County has trademarked the moniker &quot;Cheese Capital of Canada&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==
The 14 local municipalities within Hastings County are:

* Town of Bancroft
* Town of Deseronto
* Municipality of Centre Hastings
* Municipality of Hastings Highlands
* Municipality of Tweed
* Municipality of Marmora and Lake
* Township of Carlow/Mayo
* Township of Faraday
* Township of Limerick
* Township of Madoc
* Township of Stirling-Rawdon
* Township of Tudor and Cashel
* Township of Tyendinaga
* Township of Wollaston

The Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory is within the Hastings census division but is independent of the county. The cities of Belleville and Quinte West are separated municipalities and so are within the geographical boundaries of the county and included in the Hastings census division, but they not under the administration of the county government.

== History ==
Hastings County (named for Francis Rawdon-Hastings) was first organized for electoral purposes in 1792, with its boundaries described as being:

For the initial elections to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, it was united with Northumberland County and most of Lennox County for purposes of returning one member.

It was situated within the Mecklenburg District, which was later renamed the &quot;Midland District&quot; in 1792.

In 1798, the Parliament of Upper Canada passed legislation to provide, that, at the beginning of 1800:

The territory withdrawn from the County continued to form part of the Midland District.

===19th century===
In 1821, the newly surveyed townships of Elzevir, Madoc and Marmora were added to the county. While in this time agriculture was the most important industry in Hastings County, by 1822 (when the Marmora Iron Works was approaching its peak production) mining was playing an increasingly more important role in the area&#x27;s economy.

Prominent citizens of Hastings County and Ameliasburgh Township unsuccessfully petitioned the provincial government for district status during 1817, 1818, 1823 and 1825. After Prince Edward County successfully achieved its own government in 1831, Hastings County continued to send petitions throughout the 30s before finally achieving the status of a separate district in March 1837.

It was constituted as the District of Victoria in 1839 (which continued until its dissolution in 1850). By 1845, the county was declared to consist of the following geographic townships:
* Elzevir
* Grimsthorpe
* Hungerford
* Huntingdon
* Lake
* Marmora
* Madoc
* Rawdon
* Sydney
* Tudor
* Thurlow
* Tyendinaga
Belleville, after an abortive attempt two years previously, was organized as a municipality with its own Board of Police in 1836, and was designated as the district seat in 1837. It was constituted as a town under the Baldwin Act in 1850, and later became a city in 1877.

Edward Fidlar became the first warden of Hastings County with their first meeting on January 28, 1850. By this time the Hastings County Council was also interested in education and the building of the railroad.

On October 27, 1856, the first railroad train arrived in Belleville and by 1864 around 100 people were employed by the railroad.

In August 1866, discovery of gold at Eldorado, near Madoc, caused great excitement throughout Hastings County as people flooded to the area from all over North America. According to Barnes, &quot;gold has been found in twenty-seven locations spread over nine townships.&quot; The railroads and of good gravel roads opened these areas to settlement by 1880.

In 1889 the Belleville Waterworks was created as a private company, which was then bought by the city of Belleville in 1889.

===20th century===
In 1911, Hastings County was the first in the province to appoint a reforestation committee, which was instrumental in passing laws around county forests. Postal service began in the area in 1913.

By 1927 the original townships had each formed separate governance and many of them had been partitioned due to increase in population and development. The 1927 townships were:

* Bangor
* Carlow
* Cashel
* Dungannon
* Elzevir
* Faraday
* Grimsthorpe
* Herschel
* Hungerford
* Huntingdon
* Lake
* Limerick
* Madoc
* Marmora
* Mayo
* McClure
* Monteagle
* Rawdon
* Sidney
* Thurlow
* Tudor
* Tyendinaga
* Wicklow
* Wollaston
Following World War II, more efficient communication and transportation led a trend toward consolidation of township administrations:
*The Township of Carlow/Mayo was formed by amalgamation of the contiguous townships of Carlow and Mayo.
*The Township of Wicklow and McClure was formed by amalgamation of the contiguous townships of McClure and Wicklow.
*Lake Township and Marmora Township were administered as the Township of Marmora &amp; Lake.
*Elzevir Township and Grimsthorpe Township were administered as the Township of Elzevir &amp; Grimsthorpe since before 1968.
*The Township of Tudor and Cashel was formed by amalgamation of the geographically non-contiguous townships of Cashel and Tudor.

===21st century===
At the dawn of the 21st century, there has been a trend toward amalgamating rural and urban administrations. On 1 January 1998:
* The City of Quinte West was formed through amalgamation of the City of Trenton and the Township of Sidney from Hastings County, with the Village of Frankford and the Township of Murray from Northumberland County.
* The Municipality of Centre Hastings was incorporated by amalgamating Huntingdon Township with the Village of Madoc.
* The Township of Stirling-Rawdon was formed through the amalgamation of Rawdon Township with the Village of Stirling.

In 1998, the Village of Tweed was amalgamated with its Township of Hungerford and the contiguous Township of Elzevir &amp; Grimsthorpe to form the Municipality of Tweed. In 1999, the Village of Bancroft merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft.

On 1 January 2001, the Municipality of Hastings Highlands was incorporated by amalgamating the contiguous townships of Bangor, Wicklow &amp; McClure, Herschel and Monteagle. Also in 2001, the Village of Marmora amalgamated with the surrounding townships of Marmora and Lake to form the Municipality of Marmora and Lake.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Hastings County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="395426" wikidata="Q8020217" url="?curid=395426" title="William West Skiles">
<text>William West Skiles (1807–1862) was an American missionary, a Deacon in the Episcopal Church, and a teacher and community leader. He helped to found the community of Valle Crucis, North Carolina and to establish the church and missionary center there.

==Early life==
William West Skiles (October 12, 1807 - December 8, 1862) was the founder of the community of Valle Crucis, North Carolina in the 1840s, and builder of the region&#x27;s first Episcopal church. &quot;William West Skiles, Episcopal missionary and teacher, was born in Hertford, Perquimans County, North Carolina. Following a few years of formal schooling in the local schools, he worked as a mechanic and later as overseer of a group of lumber mills in the vicinity of Plymouth, North Carolina. In 1844 Skiles left eastern North Carolina to settle in the newly formed community of Valle Crucis, Watauga County, North Carolina where Levi Silliman Ives, bishop of the Diocese of North Carolina, was in the process of developing a center for missionary work, a classical and agricultural school for boys, and a theological school. During the next year a chapel, schoolhouse, and dormitory were built as well as a sawmill and a blacksmith shop. A farm and a dairy were maintained to help support the community.&quot;

==Order of the Holy Cross==
In December 1842, Bishop Levi Silliman Ives sent a priest to begin the Episcopal ministry in Valle Crucis Episcopal Mission. During the next 10 years, land was purchased, simple buildings were constructed to start the Mission School, and the Society of the Holy Cross, the first monastic order since the English Reformation in the 1500s, was formed. Ives sent William West Skiles to Valle Crucis to supervise the farming operation. Skiles was ordained a Deacon in 1847 and was instrumental in building St. John’s Episcopal Church in 1862.

&quot;William West Skiles, a native of North Carolina, was the first man in the Anglican Communion since the Reformation to persevere in the dedicated life of poverty, chastity, and obedience under vows.&quot;

==Homely Sage of Valle Crucis==
Brother Skiles often was consulted affectionately as the &quot;homely sage&quot; in the community, where few people could read or write. Local families would bring their letters to him to read for them, and to help write their answers. &quot;A minister of the Gospel, a schoolmaster, a sort of physician, he was also public Scrivener and legal adviser. Few days passed when some letter was not brought to him to read and to answer; family letters of all kinds, business letters, legal papers, with these his pen was often busy... he was also a general counselor to the neighboring population.&quot; In addition, he was respected as an arbiter, settling arguments between farmers, as well as between family members. In short, his home was a little court in a section of the country where there were few lawyers and little law enforcement.

==Death and burial==
When he died in 1862, he was buried at St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church cemetery in Valle Crucis, North Carolina. His tombstone reds &quot;Deacon. Monk. Missionary.&quot; Shortly after his death, the church was moved to a new location to avoid periodic flooding. William Skiles&#x27; remains were moved as well.

<text>The Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), also known as The Exhibition or The Ex, is an annual fair that takes place at Exhibition Place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on the third Friday of August leading up to and including Labour Day, the first Monday in September. With approximately 1.6 million visitors each year, the CNE is Canada&#x27;s largest annual community event and one of the top fairs in North America. 

The exhibition, then known as the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, first took place in 1879, largely to promote agriculture and technology in Toronto and area. Agriculturists, engineers, and scientists exhibited their discoveries and inventions at the CNE. The event has since expanded to include a carnival, live music, parades, an air show, various entertainments, sporting events, as well as art displays and specialty vendors and foods. Special events include the Warriors&#x27; Day Parade, the Labour Day Parade and the Canadian International Air Show.

==Site==

The CNE is held at Exhibition Place, which is a site located along Toronto&#x27;s waterfront on the shores of Lake Ontario just west of downtown Toronto. The site features several permanent buildings and structures, many of which have been named as significant under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;. There are several outdoor live music venues on-site including the CNE Bandshell. All of the roads are named after the Canadian provinces and territories. The site includes a football and soccer stadium, basketball practice facility, green space, fountains, plazas, a rose garden, statues and parking lots.

Historically, it is the site of Fort Rouillé, an 18th-century French fort, marked by a monument. As part of the settlement of Toronto by the British, the site became a military reserve for use by the Toronto Garrison of Fort York and cleared of forest in the early 19th century. The Exhibition received permission to use part of the reserve in the 1870s and expanded to use the whole reserve by the 1920s. In the 1950s, the site was expanded south of Lake Shore Boulevard by landfill, and reduced in size on its northern boundary by the construction of the Gardiner Expressway. During the fair, the portion of the site west of Dufferin Street is no longer used.

==Points of interest==
===Shows and attractions===
The 18-day event consists of a mix of live entertainment, agricultural displays, exhibits, a large carnival midway with many rides, games and food, casino, sports events and shopping areas. The Canadian International Air Show on Labour Day weekend has been a major feature of the fair since 1949, held over Lake Ontario just south of the CNE grounds. There are two major parades at the CNE, the Warriors&#x27; Day Parade of veterans on the first Saturday of the fair and the Labour Day Parade of workers on Labour Day. The Warriors&#x27; Day Parade honours Canada&#x27;s military veterans and includes military vehicles. 

The Canadian Armed Forces has a display each year at the fair. The fair is not affiliated with the Government of Canada; however, the federal government has often had exhibits at the CNE and has had its own pavilion.

Several buildings house exhibits and displays from vendors, government agencies and various industry associations. These include the International Pavilion of products from around the world, and the Arts, Crafts and Hobbies Building which features unique items and collectibles. The Enercare Centre complex holds the International Pavilion, a garden show, and the SuperDogs performances. It also has exhibit space used for agricultural or industrial displays and a live stage. The Food Building houses a large number of vendors offering food from many cultures, reflecting Toronto&#x27;s multicultural population. The Better Living Centre building is used for the CNE Casino on one side, and an agricultural display on the other. The CNE continues its tradition of agricultural produce competitions and the winners are displayed in the Better Living Centre.

The 1794 &quot;Scadding Cabin&quot; log cabin dates back to the first year of the fair, when it was moved here from its original location. The cabin was the residence of an early Upper Canada colonist John Scadding. The cabin is only open to the public during the CNE.

The fair has two midways of rides and carnival games. The Kiddie Midway is located in the northwest corner of Exhibition Place, with smaller rides suitable for children under 12. The midway for older youths and adults is situated west of the Enercare Centre and south of BMO Field. It has several dozen rides, including thrill rides, roller coasters, swing rides and a log plume ride. Along several pathways of the midway area are carnival games of &quot;skill&quot;, games of chance and many carnival food vendors. The CNE operates a &quot;sky ride&quot;, with chairs similar to ski-lift chairs, to carry riders from just west of the Princes&#x27; Gates to south of BMO Field.

The Coca-Cola Coliseum is used for live shows. Including high-wire acts, skating, and the RCMP Musical Ride in the past, most recently was an aerial and acrobatic show featuring Olympic skater Elvis Stojko. Outdoors, the Bandshell is used for daily music and nightly headliners. Additionally, areas are set up at various points around the ground for outdoor entertainment. These include such things as beer gardens, musical acts, acrobatic acts, buskers, parkour displays, circus acts, children&#x27;s shows and educational displays. 

The CNE grounds is also home to BMO Field, a large multi-purpose facility located in the center of the grounds. The stadium is used by two professional sports teams based in Toronto, the Toronto Argonauts Canadian football team and the Toronto FC soccer (association football) team. Each team plays at least one home game during the fair. 

The CNE holds several sports tournaments during the fair. At Coronation Park, located across Lake Shore Boulevard, to the east of the Princes&#x27; Gates, the CNE holds two baseball tournaments. It holds a youth peewee baseball tournament and a girl&#x27;s fastball tournament. The tournaments used to be played at a baseball diamond in the far west corner of Exhibition Place, but that diamond was replaced by the OVO Athletic Centre. At the Centre, the CNE holds a 3-on-3 basketball tournament.

Each night of the fair, live music is presented at the CNE Bandshell. It is an outdoor venue in the west end of the park, with a stage reminiscent of the Hollywood Bowl and bench seats in a park-like setting that gently slopes down to the Bandshell. Built in the 1930s, the stage has had a huge number of performances from famous entertainers from many different genres over the years. In the past, the various Exhibition Stadiums hosted large outdoor concerts. The current BMO Field is not used for outdoor live concerts, preserving the field&#x27;s surface for sports. Today, the Budweiser Stage south of Lake Shore Boulevard in Ontario Place hosts large live concerts during the Ex and all summer long. During the fair, several stages are set up at different places, with live music in a beer garden setting.

=== Food ===

Many options are available across the site during the fair. The CNE Food Building offers a wide variety of food options including desserts, international cuisine, and fast food, as well as novelty items, including Frosted Flake, Battered Chicken on a Stick, Deep Fried Red Velvet Oreos and Bacon Wrapped Grilled Cheese. Halal, vegetarian and healthy food options are also widely available. The Food Building, which opened September 1, 1954, celebrates its 70th anniversary in 2024.
Since the 2012 season, the CNE has hosted a food truck rally called &quot;Food Truck Frenzy.&quot; This event takes place on Princes&#x27; Boulevard just inside the Princes&#x27; Gates at the east end of the grounds. The 2016 edition featured 26 food trucks serving specialty foods. A &quot;Craft Beer Fest&quot; was added to the event in 2015 and continues to this day. During the fair, several licensed restaurants operate on the grounds.

===Shopping===

Several shopping opportunities are available for visitors at the CNE:

Queen Elizabeth Building:
* Arts, Crafts and Hobbies

Enercare Centre:

* Gaming Garage
* Home and Garden Pavilion
* International Pavilion
* Shoppers&#x27; Market
* Warehouse Outlets

Outdoors:
* Booths line several streets of the fair ground.

==History==
In September 1846, the Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West, sponsored by the Provincial Agricultural Association and the Board of Agriculture for Canada West, was held in Toronto in the area near present-day King and Simcoe Streets. While primarily an agricultural event, it also displayed manufactured goods and decorative arts and crafts. The fair was a success, and it was proposed that future fairs be held in different locations each year. In 1847, the fair was held in Hamilton and thereafter travelled to such cities as Cobourg, Kingston, Niagara, and Brockville.

In 1852, the fair returned to the west side of University Avenue (see Grange Park (neighbourhood)), stretching from a bit north of Dundas Street to a bit south of College Street. It lasted four days. The Horse Park, on the west side of the grounds, was loaned to the fair by Mrs. Boulton, who lived in the Grange, and it was bounded on the north by the Caer Howell Pleasure Grounds (in a way a forerunner of the midway). The fair was a success, attracting more than visitors. In 1853, the fair moved on to another city and didn&#x27;t return to Toronto until 1858 when the fair was held at the new Dufferin Street site. In 1878, Toronto again hosted the fair. Afterwards, Toronto City Council and the local Exhibition Committee approached the Provincial Agriculture Association with a proposition: that the fair remain permanently in Toronto. The Association thanked City Council and the Exhibition Committee for their work in delivering a successful fair in 1878 but informed them that a decision had already been made to move the fair to another city in 1879.

Toronto City Council, along with local businessmen, moved ahead with plans to establish a permanent fair in Toronto. The new fair, known as the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, opened on September 2, 1879, and lasted for three weeks (Sundays excepted). The site hosted an attendance of more than 100,000 paid admissions and 8,234 exhibits.

As the fair grew, it exhibited the latest technological advances. Exhibition patrons were introduced to electric railway transportation in 1883, to &quot;Edison&#x27;s Perfected Phonograph&quot; in 1888, to &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot; at the 1899 fair, radio in the 1920s, to television in 1939, to plastics and synthetics in the 1940s. 

In its twenty-fifth iteration, the 1903 fair was the first known as the Canadian National Exhibition, and it was officially opened by Lord Strathcona.

In 1937, Conklin Shows was awarded the contract to provide amusement rides and games for the CNE midway. The company was sold in 2004 for million and merged with two other carnival operators to form North American Midway Entertainment, which now operates the midway.

During the Second World War, as during the First World War, the CNE grounds became home to detachments of the Canadian military. In 1939, the Royal Canadian Air Force moved into the Coliseum. The Canadian Army took over the Horse Palace and the Royal Canadian Navy converted the Automotive Building into HMCS York. During the summers of 1940 and 1941, most of the troops stationed at the CNE were re-located. Those troops remaining either continued their regular administrative duties or participated in CNE displays and events aimed at promoting the Canadian war effort. CNE officials had hoped to continue the annual fair throughout the years of the war. In the spring of 1942, however, the CNE agreed to turn the grounds over to the Canadian military for use year-round. During the military occupation of the grounds, virtually every CNE building, large or small, was used by the Canadian armed forces. The CNE grounds remained closed and under the control of the Canadian military until 1946. Between 1945 and 1946, Exhibition Park was a demobilization centre for returning troops at the end of the war before closing on June 1, 1946.

The CNE resumed in 1947 without the Grandstand. Patrons returned to the CNE to see the latest in consumer goods and agricultural advancements. In 1949, the Canadian International Air Show was held for the first time at the fair. In 1968, blue laws were relaxed, allowing the CNE to open on Sundays. The CNE added the Better Living Centre, the Queen Elizabeth building and the Shell Oil Tower in the post-war period.

In the 1990s, an economic downturn and the leaving of the Blue Jays and Argonauts meant the City had no money to restore old buildings on the site. The Flyer, the Alpine Way and Exhibition Stadium were torn down and the National Trade Centre built. The Indy car race was introduced and Toronto has encouraged year-round use of Exhibition Place. Three of the westernmost former exhibit buildings are leased out for year-round attractions and are not part of the fair. The exhibit space was replaced by the new Enercare Centre. The 1993 the CNE opened with the grand opening of Medieval Times at the Government Building. The dinner theater still operates in that building as of 2025.

In 2003, the CNE celebrated its 125th anniversary, despite the first four days of the exhibition being hampered by the Northeast blackout of 2003. In 2005, the CNE introduced a Mardi Gras parade. In 2010, the CNE received EcoLogo Certification, making it the &#x27;greenest&#x27; fair in North America.

In the 2010s, the CNE added entertainment at the Coliseum. In 2012, Canadian Olympic gold-medalists Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir performed in La Vie: Aerial Acrobatics &amp; Ice Skating Show during the first 15 days of the fair, and three-time World Champion and Olympic silver-medalist Elvis Stojko closed out the show on Labour Day weekend. In 2015, Virtue and Moir returned for another ice skating and aerial acrobatics show, &quot;Bon Voyage!&quot;

In both 2013 and 2014, the CNE featured a zip line ride. The ride launched from a ten-storey launch tower north of BMO Field. The landing tower, southwest of the current Enercare Centre, was high. The zip line ride consisted of four lines, each measuring nearly . In 2016, the CNE saw the return of programming at the CNE waterfront with a daily water ski show, and national and international competitions. The same year also saw the introduction of the CNE Innovation Garage in partnership with Ryerson University, featuring a pitch competition for young inventors and displays of new inventions and projects such as ZooShare biogas.

The former baseball diamond at the very west of the site was replaced by a Toronto Raptors basketball practice facility. Baseball was moved outside of the site. The Dufferin Gate is no longer used as a point of entry to the fair. With funds from pro sports, BMO Field was built, which also necessitated the moving of the Hockey Hall of Fame downtown. In the south-west corner of the site, the Hotel X was built and the Automotive Building converted to year-round meeting space. These changes, while improving the financial position of Exhibition Place, have reduced the footprint of the fair further. In 2024, the CNE CEO raised concerns about the long-term viability of the fair with the ongoing changes to the site.

In 2020, the CNE and all associated in-person events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic—the first time the CNE has been cancelled since World War II. The CNE reported that this caused a loss of over $35 million in potential revenue, and $128 million in economic impact to Ontario. In 2021, due to the continued pandemic, the City of Toronto government cancelled all city-led and permitted outdoor in-person events through at least September 6, 2021, therefore cancelling the CNE for the second year in a row. 

The CNE resumed operations in 2022. The re-opening on August 19, 2022, was made possible due to funding received from both the Government of Canada ($7.1 million) and the Province of Ontario ($1.6 million). The financial assistance facilitated the introduction of new innovative programming featuring immersive heritage exhibits, enhancements to the Gaming Garage powered by AMD, a reoccurring nightly drone show and a multimedia show called &quot;NEVAEH &amp; the Northstar&quot;, both presented by VinFast. 

The 2023 CNE surpassed the 2015 attendance with 1,604,000 visitors passing through its gates. Attractions included the Fountain Show and the Canadian International Air Show on the waterfront. The Coliseum held an Ice Skating and Acrobatics Show &quot;Time Flies&quot; with Elvis Stojko. The Better Living Centre hosted a Pink Floyd exhibition. The bandshell&#x27;s entertainment included Dionne Warwick, Jann Arden, Amanda Marshall, Kim Mitchell, Tynomi Banks and Kardinal Offishal. The CNE marked the 130th anniversary of the Ferris Wheel by welcoming the Super Wheel, the first of its kind to appear in Toronto. Fairgoers had views of the lake and the city, inside 36-climate controlled gondolas that held four to six guests per gondola.

==Economic impact==
A 2017 Economic Impact Assessment, conducted by Enigma Research Corporation, reports that the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) generates an estimated for Greater Toronto Area and more than $128.3 million for the province of Ontario each year.

A 2009 study by the same corporation showed that the 2009 CNE attracted more than out-of-town visitors to the city, and that fair-related hiring created an equivalent of 633 full-year jobs in the region. Spending also supported of tax revenue to three levels of government. This national research initiative, commissioned by the Canadian Association of Fairs and Exhibitions (CAFE), was conducted at 20 fairs of varying sizes throughout Canada in 2008. A total of 1,200 people were interviewed during the 2008 Canadian National Exhibition alone.

Other highlights of the research, included a sample size of people in on-site, face-to-face interviews, include:

* Local residents spend million related to the CNE
* The average non-local spent 2.5 nights in Toronto.

The CNE achieved a historical milestone in 2022, by returning after a two-year closure and attracted 1.56 million visitors to its grounds; generating significant economic impact nearly for the Greater Toronto Area and for the province of Ontario each year.

The CNE hires approximately people starting in the spring of each year to assist in the planning and production of the annual fair. An additional people are hired during the fair itself by CNE partners including Emergency Services, Toronto Police, Toronto Fire, food vendors, exhibitors and concessionaires. For many young people growing up in Toronto, the CNE is their first employment experience.

The CNEA partners with many corporate sponsors and provides a space for over 700 exhibitors. Both Canadian and international businesses contribute to the CNE. The CNEA works with several organizations to promote tourism to the Greater Toronto Area and the province of Ontario, including: Festivals and Events Ontario, Tourism Toronto and Attractions Ontario.

==Governance and organizational structure==
The CNE is operated by the Canadian National Exhibition Association (CNEA) and its volunteer Board of Directors. The CNEA is governed under the jurisdiction of two Acts of the Province of Ontario: the &quot;Canadian National Exhibition Association Act&quot;, 2000, and the &quot;Agricultural and Horticultural Organizations Act&quot;, R.S.O. 1990, chapter A.9. Exhibition Place is owned by City of Toronto and is governed by the Board of Governors (BOG) of Exhibition Place.

Through various agreements with the City of Toronto, the CNEA operated as a program of the BOG until March 31, 2013. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlined the various administrative, financial and operational services to be provided to the CNEA by Exhibition Place. The MOU also provided for the use of the buildings and grounds for the annual CNE. During the decade leading up to independence, the CNEA contributed more than in site fees to the annual operating budget of the BOG, in addition to in operating surpluses. These contributions were included in consolidated annual financial results from the CNEA and BOG for the benefit of the City of Toronto.

The Board announced in 2012 that the CNEA would become an independent agency. Chair of the Board, City Councillor Mark Grimes stated: &quot;The independence of the CNEA is good for both the CNEA and Exhibition Place. The agreement will protect the Board of Governors and the City against any negative financial consequences and at the same time allow the CNEA to reach financial and organizational stability for the newly independent organization.&quot; &quot;It will be beneficial for the CNEA to be independent from the City of Toronto to be able to determine and implement consumer strategies and fiscal decisions that are made in the interest of the CNEA and its visitors, as experts within the fair business.&quot; As an independent organization, the CNEA will be able to retain its profits and re-invest in the fair. &quot;&#x27;This is an extraordinary opportunity for the Canadian National Exhibition,&#x27; stated Brian Ashton, President of the Canadian National Exhibition Association (CNEA). &#x27;We believe that as an independent business we can flourish and present an annual fair that will make Toronto and Canada proud!&#x27;&quot; &quot;Toronto City Council will be asked for approval of this new agreement at their March 5–6, 2012 meeting.&quot;

The new agreement was approved by Toronto City Council and the CNEA officially became independent on April 1, 2013. The CNEA is a non-share capital corporation and a tenant of Exhibition Place, to which it pays rent for the use of the grounds and buildings for the annual fair, as well as fees for operational services. The CNEA is not involved with year-round operations, events or development at Exhibition Place.

The CNEA has over 125 member individuals and associations representing each of the following sectors: Municipal, Manufacturers and Industry, Agriculture, and General and Liberal Arts. Member associations appoint a representative to the CNEA and approximately 15 members are appointed directly by the CNEA from the community-at-large. Each year a Board of Directors is elected from this membership, giving equal representation to each section. Six representatives of the Municipal section are appointed by Toronto City Council.

In March 2022, the Canadian National Association (CNEA) announced that Darrell Brown was appointed as Chief Executive Office (CEO) of the CNEA. President Suzan Hall explained &quot;Darrell Brown has been central to the stabilization of our organization, having secured substantial funding from both the Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario that has enabled the CNEA to survive&quot;. Darrell Brown has worked as a consultant, legal advisor, and entrepreneur over the five decades of his career. He has practiced law and consulting on employee benefits issues in Canada, lead international development projects and created acclaimed art exhibitions.

<text>The John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge (formerly the Cincinnati-Covington Bridge) is a suspension bridge that spans the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky. When opened on December 1, 1866, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world at main span, which was later overtaken by John A. Roebling&#x27;s most famous design of the 1883 Brooklyn Bridge at . Pedestrians use the bridge to get between the hotels, bars, restaurants, and parking lots in Northern Kentucky. The bar and restaurant district at the foot of the bridge on the Kentucky side is known as Roebling Point.

==Planning and charter==
In the mid-19th century, need of a passage over the Ohio River became apparent. Commerce between Ohio and Kentucky had increased to the point that the highly congested steamboat traffic was constricting the economy. A solution that would not constrict traffic on the river even further was a wire cable suspension bridge of the type developed by French engineers. Several American engineers had begun designing and building suspension bridges. One of these men was John A. Roebling of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River, however, was much wider than any river that had been bridged in France.

The Covington and Cincinnati Bridge Company was incorporated in February 1846, and the company asked Roebling to plan a bridge. The brief outline of his ideas called for a span with of clearance at high water to allow steamboats to pass unobstructed, but it included a monumental tower in the middle of the river. Steamboat and ferry interest groups lobbied against this plan. They feared an obstructed waterway, loss of a ferry market, and depreciation of property. The Ohio legislature refused the charter of the bridge. In September, Roebling published a 36-page report containing a technical discussion and an analysis of said problems. He attacked steamboat operators for using oversized chimneys, speculated on future commercial interests, and surmised on the importance of spanning western rivers. Roebling also specified that the company should make the decision as to the placement of the bridge along the river. Still, no charter was granted.

After observing the construction of a suspension bridge upriver, in Wheeling, Virginia (later West Virginia), the legislature relented and passed the charter, mandating excessive dimensions such as a main span and requesting that the legislature determine the bridge location. This latter provision would later be regretted by everyone involved. The roads of Cincinnati and Covington were laid collinear with each other, in the hope that a bridge would be built sometime in the future. When the Ohio legislature decided to choose its own location for the bridge, it failed to pick such an obvious spot, hoping to defend Cincinnati&#x27;s preeminence over Newport and Covington, the rival Kentucky cities. The bridge was actually located almost entirely in Kentucky because the state boundary follows the north bank of the river. It deprived Cincinnati forever of one of &quot;the finest and most magnificent avenues on this continent.&quot;

In 1854, a small suspension bridge over the Licking River at Newport, Kentucky, collapsed. This event deterred investors, and the bridge company could not raise enough money to start construction. Amos Shinkle was elected to the board of trustees in 1856. He brought with him a much needed boost of energy. Shinkle immediately managed to find new private investors and to procure more support from both the Ohio and Kentucky governments. During this time the bridge charter was revised, and the span of the bridge was reduced to a minimum of . By now, Roebling had established a reputation. President Ramson of the bridge company traveled to see Roebling, who was in Iowa, and he secured a contract to build the bridge. In September, Roebling arrived in Cincinnati, and much to his disgust, nothing was prepared.

==History==

Excavation for the foundation of the Covington tower commenced in September 1856 and went smoothly. A foundation was set consisting of 13 layers of oak beams, each layer set perpendicular to the one beneath it, bolted with iron hardware, and finally all cemented into place. On the Cincinnati side, work was delayed from the start. The construction crews could not pump water out of the excavating pit fast enough. After months of little progress, Roebling decided against buying costly machinery or bigger engines for his pumps and, quite last minute, designed his own square positive displacement pumps from three-inch (76 mm) pine planks. He built them locally in about forty-eight hours and ran them off of one of Amos Shinkles&#x27; tugboats, the &quot;Champion No.1&quot;. The homemade pumps displaced forty gallons of mud and clay in each cycle.

When the crews reached the compacted gravel bed of the Ohio River, Roebling decided this would be sufficient for the foundation of the Cincinnati tower. Oak timbers were laid, mirroring the foundation of the Covington tower, and within three months, masonry on both towers reached above the waterline (which, at this time, was at a record low for the fall). Work halted for the freezing temperatures and increased water level, a practice which continued seasonally until completion of the bridge. At this time, a revised contract was drawn up, stating work was to be completed by December 1858, barring &quot;unavoidable calamities&quot;.

After a hard winter of 1856–57, and a wet spring, construction resumed in July 1857. Sandstone was used for the first twenty five vertical feet of each tower base. Limestone encased this sandstone to protect against scour and collision from watercraft. The remaining height of each tower was to be constructed of sandstone, rough cut and with a large draft. Roebling said this gave the towers &quot;a massive look, quite suitable to their function.&quot;

Working from July to August 1857, the company was without liquid funds, a problem compounded by the Panic of 1857. Work halted because of the inability to pay for the project. In July 1858, operations resumed again, albeit with a smaller workforce. Only one tower was worked on at a time. President Ramson of the company died, and no work was done during the years 1859–60.

In November 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States, and the Civil War began in January 1861. Upon a threatened siege of Cincinnati from Confederate forces, a pontoon bridge was built to span the Ohio River, allowing Union troops to cross and construct defenses. Soon after, once it had become obvious that a permanent structure was vital, money from investors came pouring in. Bonds were sold, and in January 1863 materials began arriving. In the interest of building more quickly, the requirement for the height of the main span was lowered to . Preparations to resume construction were made. Machinery was ordered, and new derricks were built, but a renewed threat of invasion again temporarily halted progress. Finally, in the spring of 1863, work commenced and continued until the end of the year.

In the spring of 1864, work resumed again. Although Roebling operated his own wire mill at Trenton, New Jersey, the bridge company purchased one million pounds of wire from Richard Johnson at Manchester, England, for the cables that would span the width of the river. Roebling had used Johnson&#x27;s wire for one of his other bridges. He preferred it over wire made in the United States because it was of better quality and greater tensile strength. Anchorages on both shores were constructed of limestone base and a freestone finish. Eleven-ton iron anchors were embedded in each block, securing cables with wrought iron chain links of Roebling&#x27;s patent. The Civil War depleted the work force on the project, hindering speed and efficiency until its end.
Work on the bridge proceeded steadily after the end of the war. In September 1865 the first two wire ropes were laid. They were unwound from a spool on a barge, allowed to sink to the bottom of the river, then raised in unison from the riverbed. Wooden crossbeams were laid at regular intervals from the wire ropes, and a simple footbridge was constructed for the benefit of the workers. With the Ohio River &quot;spanned,&quot; there was a final push to complete the project even through floods and freezing temperatures. The cabling of the bridge went at a feverish pace, with about eighty wires placed per day. Hundreds watched the spider-like process from both shores. And on June 23, 1866, the last wire was taken across, for a total of 10,360 wires. These were subsequently compressed together and wrapped with an outer covering of wire into two cables of 5,180 wires each. Suspenders were hung from the cables by the end of August, and of oak lumber was laid as the floor across 300 wrought iron suspended beams. Two tracks for streetcars were laid. Diagonal stays were added to increase load capacity, strengthen the floor, and check vibration. Wrought iron trusses were added, running the length of the bridge.

On December 1, 1866, pedestrians walked upon the bridge, known locally only as &quot;The Suspension Bridge,&quot; for the first time. Over 166,000 people walked across in the first two days. Final touches were put on the bridge over the next few months, and construction officially ended in July 1867. Two men died during construction. When the Roebling Bridge was formally opened on January 1, 1867, the driver of a horse and buggy was charged a toll of 15 cents to cross; the toll for three horses and a carriage was 25 cents. Pedestrians were charged one cent.

The bridge was repainted blue in 1894.
The original deck of the bridge was built at the lowest possible cost because of Civil War inflation, but the stone towers had been designed to carry a much heavier load than was originally demanded. In 1896, the bridge received a second set of main cables, a wider steel deck, and a longer northern approach. The reconstruction significantly altered the appearance of the bridge, but the new 30-ton weight limit extended its usefulness through the 20th century and beyond.

In 1901, electric lighting was added to the bridge.
In 1918, an extension of the approach was completed to Third Street.

Ramps were constructed leading directly from the bridge to the Dixie Terminal building used for streetcars in the late 1920s. These provided Covington–Cincinnati streetcars &quot;with a grade-separated route to the center of downtown, and the terminal building was originally intended to connect, via underground pedestrian passages, with the never-built Fountain Square Station of the infamous Cincinnati Subway.&quot;
At the time the Suspension Bridge was built, the Ohio River was very shallow, often only a few feet deep. A 100-foot vertical clearance was important as steamboats had high stacks to keep sparks as far as possible from the rest of the wooden craft. As more railroads were built and barges replaced steamboat traffic, dams to raise the river and control flooding made sense. In the early 1900s Congress authorized a system of locks and dams along the Ohio River. In 1929, the canalization project produced 51 wooden wicket dams and lock chambers along its length. This system assured that the depth of river at Cincinnati never fell below 9 feet. During the 1940s, a shift from steam propelled to diesel powered towboats allowed for longer barges than could be accommodated by the existing dams. In the 1950s the US Army Corps of Engineers replaced the outdated system with new non-navigable dams made of concrete and steel. These dams raised the height of the river at Cincinnati to a normal pool of about 26 feet, lowering the clearance of the Roebling Suspension Bridge to around 74 feet.

The Covington-Cincinnati Bridge Company—a private company—operated the bridge until the Commonwealth of Kentucky purchased it in 1953 for $4.2 million. Soon after this, the bridge was redecked to have a steel deck instead of the previous wooden one.

When streetcar service ceased in the 1950s, the ramps onto the Dixie terminal were rebuilt to be used by diesel buses.

The state collected tolls until 1963 when the Brent Spence Bridge was opened on Interstate 75, downstream, approximately to the west of The Roebling Suspension Bridge.

In the fall of 1966, the bridges 100th anniversary was celebrated with a parade at Court Street.

In 1969, the bridge was renovated.

The bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975.

In 1976, in honor of America&#x27;s bicentennial, the bridge was painted light blue.

Initially called the &quot;Covington-Cincinnati Suspension Bridge&quot; or &quot;Ohio River Bridge&quot;, it was renamed in honor of its designer and builder on June 27, 1983. It was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark the same year.

In 1984, at the cost of $200,000, the bridge had lighting installed on its cables. They also later restored its sprails at the cost of 10 million.

In 1996, the bridge was renovated.

The ramps onto the Dixie Terminal were demolished in 1998 when it ceased being used as a bus terminal.

The Commonwealth of Kentucky closed the bridge on November 13, 2006, to make extensive repairs to the structure. It reopened in late March. However, it closed again for much of 2008 for repainting.

On September 11, 2007, the Commonwealth of Kentucky reduced the weight limit to 11 tons to prevent future structural damage following an analysis by the University of Kentucky. The lower weight limit prevents buses from crossing the bridge.

The Commonwealth of Kentucky once again closed the bridge on April 7, 2010, for repainting; the bridge reopened in November 2010. The closing of the bridge only affected vehicular traffic, while one pedestrian lane remained open.

On January 10, 2013, a large piece of sandstone fell from the north tower causing the bridge to be closed for approximately 4 hours during rush hour. This time was used to remove debris and inspect the tower for further damage.

On March 21, 2018, the bridge was closed until April 27 after an automobile accident damaged a steel section of the bridge. On April 17, 2019, another piece of sandstone fell, prompting closure until August 9.

On November 11, 2020, the nearby Brent Spence Bridge was closed following a fiery collision. Semitrucks began using the Roebling Bridge as an alternate crossing point, in violation of the bridge&#x27;s 11-ton weight limit, prompting Covington police to close the suspension bridge to all vehicular traffic so additional safeguards could be put in place. The Roebling Bridge reopened on November 13, 2020, with Covington and Cincinnati police monitoring traffic on the bridge.

On February 15, 2021, the bridge closed for a nine-month rehabilitation project; it reopened in November 2021.

<doc id="395452" wikidata="Q48961" url="?curid=395452" title="Calypso (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Calypso (; ) was a nymph who lived on the island of Ogygia, where, according to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, she detained Odysseus for seven years against his will. She promised Odysseus immortality if he would stay with her, but Odysseus preferred to return home. Eventually, after the intervention of the other gods, Calypso was forced to let Odysseus go.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Calypso&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek (), meaning , , or ; as such, her name translates to as she conceals Odysseus from the rest of the world, keeping him on her island. According to the medieval dictionary &quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot;, her name means (from ), which – combined with the Homeric epithet (, meaning or ) – justifies the reclusive character of Calypso and her island.

==Family==
Calypso is generally said to be the daughter of the Titan Atlas. Her mother is mostly unnamed, but Hyginus wrote that it was Pleione, mother of the Pleiades, although Calypso was not traditionally counted among the Pleiades.

Hesiod and the anonymous author of the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot; mention either a different Calypso or possibly the same Calypso as one of the Oceanid nymphs, daughters of Tethys and Oceanus. Apollodorus includes the name Calypso in his list of Nereids, the daughters of Nereus and Doris. John Tzetzes meanwhile makes her a daughter of the sun-god Helios and the Oceanid nymph Perse, who are also the parents of Circe, perhaps due to her association with Circe; the two goddesses were sometimes confused due to their behaviour and connection to Odysseus.

According to a fragment from the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, Calypso bore the Cephalonians to Hermes as suggested by Hermes&#x27; visits to her island in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

== Mythology ==
=== The &quot;Odyssey&quot; ===
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Calypso tries to keep the fabled Greek hero Odysseus on her island to make him her immortal husband, while he also gets to enjoy her sensual pleasures forever. According to Homer, Calypso kept Odysseus prisoner by force at Ogygia for seven years. Calypso enchants Odysseus with her singing as she moves to and from weaving on her loom with a golden shuttle.

Odysseus comes to wish for circumstances to change. He can no longer bear being separated from his wife, Penelope, and wants to tell Calypso. He spends the daytime sitting on a headland or at the sea-shore crying, while at night he is forced to sleep with her in the cave against his will. His patron goddess Athena asks Zeus to order the release of Odysseus from the island; Zeus orders the messenger Hermes to tell Calypso to set Odysseus free, for it was not Odysseus&#x27;s destiny to live with her forever. She angrily comments on how the gods hate goddesses having affairs with mortals.

Calypso provides Odysseus with an axe, drill, and adze to build a boat. Calypso leads Odysseus to an island where he can chop down trees and make planks for his boat. Calypso also provides him with wine, bread, clothing, and more materials for his boat. The goddess then sets wind at his back when he sets sail. After seven years, Odysseus has built his boat and leaves Calypso.

=== Other narratives ===
Homer does not mention any children by Calypso. By some accounts that came after the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Calypso bore Odysseus a son, Latinus, though Circe is usually given as Latinus&#x27; mother. In other accounts, Calypso bore Odysseus two children, Nausithous and Nausinous.

The story of Odysseus and Calypso has some close resemblances to the interactions between Gilgamesh and Siduri in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; in that &quot;the lone female plies the inconsolable hero-wanderer with drink and sends him off to a place beyond the sea reserved for a special class of honoured people&quot; and &quot;to prepare for the voyage he has to cut down and trim timbers&quot;.

A fragment from the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, erroneously attributed to Hesiod, claimed that Calypso detained Odysseus for years as a favour to Poseidon, the sea-god who detested Odysseus for blinding his son Polyphemus.

According to Hyginus, Calypso killed herself because of her love for Odysseus.

==In literature==
In her poem , Letitia Landon describes her as eternally yearning for Odysseus&#x27; return and comments on the folly of such obsession.

==Philosophy==
Philosophers have written about the meaning of Calypso in the world of ancient Greece. Ryan Patrick Hanley commented on the interpretation of Calypso in &quot;Les Aventures de Télémaque&quot; written by Fénelon. Hanley says that the story of Calypso illustrates the link between Eros and pride. Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer brought attention to the combination of power over fate and the sensibility of &quot;bourgeois housewives&quot; in the depiction of Calypso.

<text>General Sir William Dillon Otter (December 3, 1843 – May 6, 1929) was a professional Canadian soldier who became the first Canadian-born Chief of the General Staff, the head of the Canadian Militia. He led troops in the suppression of the 1885 rebellion.

==Military career==
Otter was born near Clinton, Canada West. His parents were Anna Louisa, née de la Hooke (1824–1907) and Alfred William Otter (1815–1866), both English immigrants who married in Ontario on 15 September 1842. He began his military career in the Non-Permanent Active Militia in Toronto in 1864. Captain William Otter was Adjutant of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Toronto in 1866. He first saw combat with them at the Battle of Ridgeway during the Fenian Raids.

He joined the Permanent Force as an infantry officer when Canada established its own professional infantry unit in 1883. On May 2, 1885, he led a Canadian force of more than 300 in the Battle of Cut Knife against a Cree and Assiniboine camp defended by Poundmaker and Fine-Day. Otter&#x27;s tactics were ineffective against the defending warriors. 

He was appointed as the first commanding officer of the Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in 1893.

During the Second Boer War, Otter, by then a lieutenant colonel, commanded the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion of The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in South Africa. Otter played an important part in the Battle of Paardeberg. 

He became the first Canadian-born officer to command Canada&#x27;s military in 1908, and retired in 1910 as a major general. In 1922 he was the second Canadian, after Sir Arthur Currie, to be appointed a full general. Otter had the reputation of being something of a martinet – due mainly to his desire that the young Canadian Army should not show up badly when compared to British troops.

He wrote &quot;The Guide: A Manual for the Canadian Militia (Infantry) Embracing the Interior Economy, Duties, Discipline, Drills and Parades, Dress, Books, and Correspondence of a Battalion with Regulations for Marches, Transport &amp; Encampment, Also Forms &amp; Bugle Calls&quot; in 1914, which includes sections on discipline, courts martial, offences, complaints, and defaulters.

During the First World War he came out of retirement to command operations for the internment of enemy nationals resident in Canada.

Otter headed the Otter Commission. The Otter Commission was tasked to establish links of perpetuation from the units of Canadian Expeditionary Force back to the institutionally separate units of the Canadian Militia in the years following the First World War. This establishment of perpetuation, based primarily on geographical connections through original recruiting areas of the CEF infantry battalions and CEF mounted regiments, provided a basis by which the achievements and battle honours of the CEF units transferred back to the units of the standing Militia. Without this work of the Otter Commission the CEF and its achievements would have had no continuance with existing units of the Canadian Army today.

General Sir William Otter died on 6 May 1929.

==Freemason==
Otter was initiated into the Ionic Lodge of Freemasonry in Toronto in February 1869. He became Worshipful Master in 1873.

==Legacy==

Otter Squadron, composed of University Training Plan Non Commissioned Member (UTPNCM) Officer Cadets, at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, was named in his honour and the Cadet Squadron Leader of Otter Squadron is permitted to carry his sword on graduation parade.

==Family connections==
In October 1895 he married Marian Porter, daughter of James Porter &amp; Agnes Dryden. They had three sons and one daughter. Otter was the grandfather of Canadian Military historian Desmond Morton.

<text>George Edward Challenger is a fictional character in a series of fantasy and science fiction stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unlike Doyle&#x27;s self-controlled, analytical character, Sherlock Holmes, Professor Challenger is an aggressive, hot-tempered, dominating figure.

Like Sherlock Holmes, Professor Challenger was based on a real person—in this case, two people: an explorer named Percy Fawcett, who was Doyle&#x27;s friend; and a professor of physiology named William Rutherford, who had lectured at the University of Edinburgh while Conan Doyle studied medicine there.

==Fictional character biography==

George Edward Challenger, FRS, MD, DSc, is born in Largs, Ayrshire in 1863 and educated at Largs Academy before studying at the University of Edinburgh. Dr Challenger is appointed to an assistant position at the British Museum in 1892 and is promoted within a year to assistant keeper in the Comparative Anthropology Department. He holds a professorship in Zoology and is elected President of the Zoological Institute in London. Several of his inventions are successfully applied in industry and bring him additional income.

Edward Malone, the narrator of &quot;The Lost World&quot;, the 1912 novel in which Challenger first appears, describes his first meeting with the character:

Challenger is also a pretentious and self-righteous scientific jack-of-all-trades. Although considered by Malone&#x27;s editor, Mr McArdle, to be &quot;just a homicidal megalomaniac with a turn for science&quot;, his ingenuity can be counted upon to solve any problem or get out of any unsavoury situation, and be sure to offend and insult many people in the process. He is also seen as extremely vain by his colleagues: Edward Malone says that &quot;he is convinced, of course, that he is destined for Westminster Abbey&quot; (i.e. famous enough to be buried there), and later speculates that &quot;in his fancy, may he see himself sometimes, gracing the vacant pedestal in Trafalgar Square&quot;. Challenger is, in many ways, rude, crude, and without social conscience or inhibition. Yet he is a man capable of great loyalty and his love of his wife is all-encompassing.

Challenger marries Jessica—&#x27;Jessie&#x27;—and the couple settles at 14 Enmore Gardens, Enmore Park, Kensington, London. After his adventures in South America Challenger and his wife purchase The Briars, in Rotherfield, Sussex, as a second home. Later, following his wife&#x27;s death from influenza, Challenger sells his London home and rents an apartment on the third floor in Victoria West Gardens, London. Challenger&#x27;s friend and biographer, the journalist Edward &#x27;Ted&#x27; Dunn Malone, marries Enid Challenger, the Professor&#x27;s daughter, in the summer of 1927. Malone was born in Ireland and achieved some fame in rugby football at international level for Ireland before a career in journalism at the &quot;Daily Gazette&quot;. Enid Challenger is a freelance reporter at the same newspaper.

In July 1908, Malone joins Challenger, the 66-year-old Mr Summerlee (c. 1842–1925), Professor of Comparative Anatomy, and the explorer and mountaineer Lord John Roxton, third son of the Duke of Pomfret and then in his mid-forties, on an expedition to the Amazon Basin, where Challenger claims to have observed creatures from the Jurassic Age two years previously. On reaching the mouth of the Amazon River in Pará state, the expedition hires local guides and servants Mojo, José, Fernando, Gomez, Manuel and Zambo. From Manaus the expedition continues up-river to reach an unnamed tributary, which they follow by canoe until by late August the explorers arrive in the Guiana Highlands and the table-top mountain (tepui) that is the Lost World. The expedition camps at the foot of the basalt cliffs of the tepui, which they name Maple White Land in honour of the plateau’s discoverer some four years earlier. The isolated plateau is home to numerous prehistoric animals, previously known only from the fossil record, including pterodactyls, allosaurids, iguanodon and an early species of hominid. A group of indigenous people also occupy the plateau, and the explorers aid them to subjugate the predatory &#x27;ape-men&#x27;. The expedition returns to London, bringing with them diamonds worth £200,000. Professors Challenger and Summerlee present their findings to the Zoological Institute on 7 November 1908 at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, Regent Street, London. They claim to have discovered over 150 new species, some dating from the Early Jurassic.

Three years later, the friends re-assemble in Challenger’s Sussex home to witness &quot;The Poison Belt&quot; incident of 27 to 28 August 1911. Challenger interprets a shift in Fraunhofer&#x27;s light diffraction lines to predict that the Earth is passing through a deadly interstellar cloud of ether. By breathing oxygen from cylinders brought to the house earlier, Challenger, his wife and friends avoid falling into catalepsy over the several hours the event lasted. It appears as though all animal life on the planet expired but within 28 hours all recovered.

Challenger is able to pursue his scientific interests independently as a result of a bequest by the rubber millionaire Betterton. He purchases an estate on Hengist Down near to his Sussex home and engages construction firm Morden &amp; Company to begin sinking a vertical shaft to a depth of eight miles. In the spring of 1921, American specialist in artesian wells Mr Peerless Jones is engaged to plunge his drilling rod a further hundred feet into the apparently-living protoplasmic substance that was revealed at the bottom of the shaft. Challenger hopes through this experiment to prove that the Earth is a living organism that sustains its vitality from the ether of outer space. Preparations are ready by Tuesday 21 June 1921, and the drill breaches the tissue, producing a loud scream and unleashing a geyser of a protective tar-like secretion, accompanied by global volcanic activity. It is the day &quot;When the World Screamed&quot;.

Some months later, Challenger and Malone are the last people to meet the Latvian inventor Theodore Nemor, who claimed to have discovered the physics of disintegrating and then reassembling matter. Nemor apparently seeks competing bids from the British and Soviet governments to buy &quot;The Disintegration Machine&quot; at the time of his unexplained disappearance from London.

The death of Jessica Challenger affects her husband profoundly. Professor Challenger undertakes an investigation into psychic phenomena after Ted Malone and Enid Challenger&#x27;s reports on spiritualism appear in the Daily Gazette in October 1926. Lord John Roxton, Malone, and the Reverend Charles Mason, a former Church of England exorcist who took up Spiritualism, visits a haunted house at Dryfont in Derbyshire. An apparition at the house convince the two friends of the reality of the spirit world and they set out to explore &quot;The Land of Mist&quot; further. Challenger joins the investigation ostensibly to demonstrate the fallacies of psychic research but becomes convinced of the reality of intercourse with the spirits of the dead and announces his conversion in a polemic carried by &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine.

==Stories==
===By Arthur Conan Doyle===
====Novels====
* 1912 – &quot;The Lost World&quot;, which describes an expedition to a plateau in South America where prehistoric creatures including dinosaurs still survive.
* 1913 – &quot;The Poison Belt&quot;, in which the Earth passes through a cloud of poisonous ether.
* 1926 – &quot;The Land of Mist&quot;, a story of the supernatural, reflecting the strong belief in spiritualism which Conan Doyle developed later in life.

====Short stories====
* 1928 – &quot;When the World Screamed&quot;, on Challenger&#x27;s World Echinus theory.
* 1929 – &quot;The Disintegration Machine&quot;, concerning the potentially dangerous new invention by a scientist named Theodore Nemor.

===By other authors===
*&quot;The Footprints on the Ceiling&quot;: Jules Castier in his 1919 anthology of pastiches &quot;Rather Like&quot;. In the story, Edward Malone recounts how Sherlock Holmes was called upon to locate the vanished, seemingly kidnapped, Professor Challenger. The story also was reprinted in the anthology, &quot;The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1944), edited by Ellery Queen.
*&quot;Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s War of the Worlds&quot;: Manly Wade Wellman and Wade Wellman. A slightly anachronistic romp, in which Sherlock Holmes and Challenger oppose H. G. Wells&#x27; Martian hordes and one of Holmes&#x27; old enemies. Holmes is the hero, but Challenger plays a major part. It is mentioned that Challenger helped Holmes solve the case of the Giant Rat of Sumatra.
*Osamu Tezuka published in 1948 a manga version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot;. Tezuka&#x27;s manga, however, is a Lost World unlike any other. Not an adaptation, this is a complete re-imagining of the story set on an alien planet. 
*There have been several other comic adaptations of Professor Challenger&#x27;s exploits, but none that were particularly widespread and well known. A descendant of Professor Challenger, named Darwin Challenger, is a minor character in Valiant&#x27;s &quot;Turok: Dinosaur Hunter&quot; comics, first appearing in issue #7. He bears a strong resemblance to his ancestor and makes numerous references to events in the Lost World. Professor Challenger and his companions are also referenced in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; series. According to writer Alan Moore, Challenger had a lifelong friendship with the zoologist Dr. Dolittle. Arguably the most notable appearance is the Dell Comics adaptation of the 1960 movie version of &quot;The Lost World&quot;, as an issue of their &quot;Four Color&quot; series.
*&quot;Return to the Lost World&quot;: Nicholas Nye. A sequel set a year later than &quot;The Lost World&quot;, which almost ignores the dinosaurs in favour of a plot involving parapsychology, an extremely odd version of evolutionary theory, and ancient technology in the style of &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot;. While Conan Doyle&#x27;s Challenger is a foe of scientific fraud, this novel begins with him preparing a scientific fake. 
*Challenger, alongside Nikola Tesla, plays a major role in two of Ralph Vaughan&#x27;s four Sherlock Holmes/H. P. Lovecraft crossovers, &quot;The Adventure of the Dreaming Detective&quot; (1992) and &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Terror Out of Time&quot; (2001).
*&quot;Sherlock Holmes in the Lost World&quot; (2008) by Martin Powell in anthology &quot;Gaslight Grimoire&quot; (reprinted in &quot;Sherlock Holmes: The Crossover Casebook&quot;), in which Challenger is lost in the Lost World again and rescued by Sherlock Holmes. Challenger has a daughter who is also &quot;Professor Challenger&quot;.
*&quot;Dinosaur Summer&quot;: Greg Bear. Thirty years after Professor Challenger discovered dinosaurs in Venezuela, dinosaur circuses have become popular and are slipping out of the spotlight. The one remaining dinosaur circus makes a bold move to return their dinosaurs to the Tepuye plateau. Challenger himself never appears, but the protagonist&#x27;s son attended Challenger High School.
* In this sequel Professor Summerlee, Lord Roxton and the narrator Malone accompany Challenger on a journey to the moon, in a desperate bid to save the people of Ell Ka-Mar, who have crowned Challenger their king.
*Challenger makes a guest appearance in the 3rd Plateau of Gilles Deleuze &amp; Félix Guattari&#x27;s post-structuralist philosophical text &quot;A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot;, in which he gives a lecture.
*The Gorilla Comics series &quot;Section Zero&quot;, written by Karl Kesel, featured a scientific genius named Titania &quot;Doc&quot; Challenger, implied to be Professor Challenger&#x27;s descendant.
*&quot;Cult Holmes: The Lost World&quot;: In this BBC 7 Cult Holmes story, Holmes is investigating the damage done by Challenger in bringing dinosaurs over from the plateau. Malone&#x27;s account of events is referred to as if it had been the version of events in the BBC TV adaptation of &quot;The Lost World&quot;, rather than the novel.
*In &quot;Los Sabios en Salamanca&quot; (The Sages in Salamanca), a Spanish short novel by Alberto López Aroca, included in the book &quot;Los Espectros Conjurados&quot; (), Challenger and his friend Lord John Roxton meet Professor Abraham Van Helsing (from Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;) in Salamanca, and attend a meeting of the Sociedad Hermética Española (a Spanish esoteric society). In the story also appear other characters, as H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Randolph Carter, and Spanish writers Francisco de Quevedo and Diego de Torres Villarroel.
*In the 1960 novel &quot;World of the Gods&quot; by Pel Torro (a pseudonym of Lionel Fanthorpe), a malevolent shapeshifting alien takes on the physical form of Professor Challenger, believing him to be a real-life Earth scientist, and is then forced to remain in this form for the rest of the novel.
*The third book in the Iris Wildthyme series by Obverse Books, Miss Wildthyme and Friends Investigate, begins with a novella entitled &quot;The Found World&quot; by Jim Smith, a pseudo-sequel to &quot;The Lost World&quot; featuring Challenger, Dr. John H. Watson and Dracula, among others.
*The third supplement for the Forgotten Futures role playing game is &quot;George E. Challenger&#x27;s Mysterious World&quot; (1994), based on and including the Challenger novels and stories.
*Professor William Rutherford, the real-life model for Challenger, is portrayed by actor John Sessions in one of the series of BBC Films titled &quot;Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode by Stephen Gallagher opens with the young Conan Doyle&#x27;s attendance at a lantern slide lecture by famed explorer Everard im Thurn featuring the &#x27;Lost World&#x27; plateau of Mount Roraima. The story goes on to hint at experiences that Doyle would later draw upon for the novel.
*Professor Challenger is a major supporting character in the novel &quot;Sherlock Holmes im Reich des Ctulhu&quot; (&quot;Sherlock Holmes in the Realm of Cthulhu&quot;) by Klaus-Peter Walther and the audio play after that novel.

==Portrayals==
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was the first person to portray Professor Challenger, dressing and making up as the professor for a photograph he wanted included in &quot;The Lost World&quot;″s initial serialized publication in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;. The editor refused, feeling that such hoaxes were potentially damaging. Hodder &amp; Stoughton had no such qualms and featured the image in the first book edition.

Since then, the following actors have played the role:

* Wallace Beery in the 1925 film &quot;The Lost World&quot;.
* Francis L. Sullivan in the 1944 BBC radio adaptations of &quot;The Lost World&quot; and &quot;The Poison Belt&quot;.
* Claude Rains in the 1960 film &quot;The Lost World&quot;.
* Basil Rathbone in &quot;Dinosaurs!&quot;, a 1966 radio-style audio adaptation of &quot;The Lost World&quot; released on MGM/Leo the Lion Records.
* Francis de Wolff in a 1975 BBC Radio 4 broadcast of &quot;The Lost World&quot;.
* John Rhys-Davies in the 1992 film &quot;The Lost World&quot; and its 1992 sequel &quot;Return to the Lost World&quot;.
* Armin Shimerman in a radio-style audio cassette/compact disc adaptation from Alien Voices in 1997.
* Patrick Bergin in the 1998 film &quot;The Lost World&quot;.
* Peter McCauley in the early 1999 cable-TV movie adaptation and the subsequent 1999–2002 television series &quot;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s The Lost World&quot;.
* Bob Hoskins in the 2001 film &quot;The Lost World&quot;. Airing in the UK in two parts over Christmas Day and Boxing Day in 2001, it was the first British film adaptation.
* Bruce Boxleitner played a modernized version of Challenger as a United States Air Force Lieutenant in the 2005 film &quot;King of the Lost World&quot;.
* Bill Paterson in the 2011 BBC Radio adaptations of &quot;When the World Screamed&quot; and &quot;The Disintegration Machine&quot;.
* David Robb in the 2011 Classic Serial BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;The Lost World&quot;.
* Martin W. Payne in the 2019 short film &quot;Professor Challenger &amp; The Disintegration Machine&quot;

<doc id="395465" wikidata="Q912327" url="?curid=395465" title="Brian Helgeland">
<text>Brian Thomas Helgeland (born January 17, 1961) is an American screenwriter, film producer, and director. He is best known for writing the screenplays for the films &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1998) and &quot;Mystic River&quot; (2003). He wrote and directed the films &quot;42&quot;, a biopic of Jackie Robinson; and &quot;Legend&quot;, about the rise and fall of the infamous London gangsters, the Kray twins. His work on &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; earned him the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Early life==
Helgeland was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Norwegian immigrants Aud-Karin and Thomas Helgeland. He was raised in nearby New Bedford, Massachusetts. He majored in English at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth before following his father&#x27;s work in fishing scallop.

A particularly cold winter day in 1985 made Helgeland consider finding another job. He was fascinated by a book about film schools. With a love for movies, Helgeland decided to seek a career in film. He applied for the film school at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, the only one to agree to accept him in mid-semester.

==Career==
Helgeland&#x27;s agent arranged a meeting fo him with Rhet Topham, who had an idea for a horror comedy film but was having difficulty writing it. The duo completed &quot;976-EVIL&quot;, which they sold for $12,000. &quot;976-EVIL&quot; marked the directorial debut of actor Robert Englund, who had portrayed Freddy Krueger in films of that franchise (&quot;A Nightmare on Main Street&quot;). 

He recommended Helgeland to New Line Cinema representatives, who wanted to do a new &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film. Helgeland was paid $70,000 to write what was released as &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot;. Both films were released in 1988, with &quot;The Dream Master&quot; hitting theaters earlier. 

Helgeland earned $275,000 for his script for &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, which was released in 1992. In 1990, Helgeland and Manny Coto sold a script, &quot;The Ticking Man&quot;, for $1 million, but the film was never made.

In 1998, Helgeland won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, which was based on the 1990 novel of the same name by James Ellroy. That year Helgeland also won a Razzie for &quot;The Postman&quot;, being one of only three people to have previously achieved this dubious feat (preceded by Alan Menken in 1993 and followed by Sandra Bullock in 2010). Helgeland accepted the Razzie, the fourth person to receive the statuette in person, which was delivered to him in his office at Warner Bros. He keeps the statues of both the Oscar and the Razzie on his mantle as &quot;a reminder of Hollywood&#x27;s idealistic nature and unrealistic expectations.&quot;
Helgeland wrote and directed the films &quot;Payback&quot; (1999), &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2001), &quot;The Order&quot; (2003), &quot;42&quot; (2013), and &quot;Legend&quot; (2015). He has worked with director Clint Eastwood twice, in 2002 on&quot; Blood Work&quot;, and in 2003 on &quot;Mystic River&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. He also has written an as-yet-unproduced adaptation of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

In 2004, Helgeland co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, for which he was uncredited. In early 2008, he was attached to shape the script of the thriller &quot;Green Zone&quot; after screenwriter Tom Stoppard had to drop out. He collaborated with director Paul Greengrass, whom he worked with on &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, as well as reuniting with actor Matt Damon, who played Jason Bourne/David Webb. 

Helgeland wrote the screenplay for the remake of &quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot;, replacing screenwriter David Koepp. The film was released on June 12, 2009.

On May 4, 2017, HBO announced that Helgeland was one of four writers working on a potential pilot for a &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; spin-off. In addition to Helgeland, Carly Wray, Max Borenstein, and Jane Goldman were also working on potential pilots. Helgeland has been working and communicating with George R. R. Martin, the author of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, the series of novels upon which the original series is based. Former &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; showrunners D. B. Weiss and David Benioff were said to be executive producers for whichever project is picked up by HBO.

==Personal life==
Helgeland and his wife Nancy have two sons.

<text>Harjumaa (; ) (1200 hides), was a historical county in Ancient Estonia until the early 13th century. Its territory roughly corresponds to modern-day Rapla County with the town of Rapla as the capital. According to the &quot;Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot;, Raikila was the main village of Harjumaa, where annual gatherings of the surrounding tribes took place.

Despite the name, the present-day Harju County covers only a small portion of the historical Harjumaa land, with most of its current territory corresponding to the ancient county of Revala.

== History ==

Between the 10th and 12th centuries, one of the largest trading centers in Haarjumaa was the Varbola Stronghold (). The first crusade to Haarjumaa occurred in the summer of 1216, initiated by the crusaders of Riga. It involved Livonians, Latgalians, and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, led by Master Volkwin. To secure a truce, Volkwin demanded that the inhabitants of Varbola accept Christianity and release their prisoners.

<doc id="395469" wikidata="Q5694886" url="?curid=395469" title="Heavenly Mother (Mormonism)">
<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, Heavenly Mother, also known as Mother in Heaven, is the mother of human spirits and the wife of God the Father. Collectively Heavenly Mother and Father are called Heavenly Parents. Those who accept the Mother in Heaven doctrine trace its origins to Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. The doctrine became more widely known after Smith&#x27;s death in 1844.

The Heavenly Mother doctrine is taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ, and branches of Mormon fundamentalism, such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The doctrine is not generally recognized by other denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, such as the Community of Christ, where trinitarianism is predominant.

In the LDS Church, the doctrine of &quot;Heavenly Mother&quot; or &quot;heavenly parents&quot; is not frequently discussed; however, the doctrine can be found in some church hymns and has been briefly discussed in church teaching manuals and several sermons.

== Origin of the theology ==

The theological underpinnings of a belief in Heavenly Mother are attributed to Joseph Smith, who shortly before his death in 1844 outlined a controversial view of God that differed dramatically from traditional Christian consensus. Smith&#x27;s theology included the belief that God would share his glory with his children and that righteous couples might become exalted beings, or gods and goddesses, in the afterlife.

Although there is no known record of Smith explicitly teaching about Heavenly Mother, several of Smith&#x27;s contemporaries attributed the theology to him either directly, or as a natural consequence of his theological stance. An editorial footnote of &quot;History of the Church&quot; 5:254, quotes Smith as saying: &quot;Come to me; here&#x27;s the mysteries man hath not seen, Here&#x27;s our Father in heaven, and Mother, the Queen.&quot; In addition, a secondhand account states that in 1839, Smith had told Zina Diantha Huntington, after the death of her mother, that &quot;not only would she know her mother again on the other side, but &#x27;more than that, you will meet and become acquainted with your eternal Mother, the wife of your Father in Heaven.

In addition, members of the Anointed Quorum, a highly select leadership group in the early church that was privy to Smith&#x27;s teachings, also acknowledged the existence of a Heavenly Mother. The &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; published a letter to the editor from a pseudonymous person named &quot;Joseph&#x27;s Speckled Bird&quot;, in which the author stated that in the pre-Earth life, the spirit &quot;was a child with his father and mother in heaven&quot;. The apostle Parley Pratt even taught in an official church periodical that God may have had multiple wives before Christ&#x27;s time, and that after the death of Mary (the mother of Jesus) she may have become another eternal wife.

In 1845, after the death of Smith, the poet Eliza Roxcy Snow published a poem entitled &quot;My Father in Heaven&quot;, (later titled &quot;Invocation, or the Eternal Father and Mother&quot;, now used as the lyrics in the Latter-day Saint hymn &quot;O My Father&quot;), which acknowledged the existence of a Heavenly Mother. The poem contained the following language:

Some early Mormons considered Snow to be a prophetess. Later, church president Joseph F. Smith (a nephew of Joseph Smith) explained his own belief that &quot;God revealed that principle that we have a mother as well as a father in heaven to Joseph Smith; Joseph Smith revealed it to Eliza Snow Smith, his wife; and Eliza Snow was inspired, being a poet, to put it into verse.&quot; A companion hymn &quot;Our Mother in Heaven&quot; was published in the church&#x27;s &quot;Juvenile Instructor&quot; four decades later.

The doctrine is also attributed to several other early church leaders. According to one sermon by Brigham Young, Smith once said he &quot;would not worship a God who had not a father; and I do not know that he would if he had not a mother; the one would be as absurd as the other.&quot;

=== Multiple Heavenly Mothers ===

Polygamy has played an important part in Mormon history and multiple Mormon denominations have teachings on the existence of a polygamous Heavenly Father married to multiple Heavenly Mothers. Brigham Young taught that God the Father was polygamous, although teachings on Heavenly Mothers were never as popular and disappeared from official rhetoric after the end of LDS polygamy in 1904 (although existing polygynous marriages lasted into the 1950s). Top leaders used the examples of the polygamy of God the Father in defense of the practice and this teaching was widely accepted by the late 1850s. Apostle Orson Pratt taught in an official church periodical that &quot;We have now clearly shown that God the Father had a plurality of wives,&quot; and that after her death, Mary (the mother of Jesus) may have become another eternal polygamous wife of God. One scholar interpreted a 1976 LDS manual as alluding to this teaching. Author Carol Lynn Pearson stated that a seminary teacher from her youth fervently taught that there were multiple Heavenly Mothers. Another denomination, the Apostolic United Brethren, believes in multiple Mothers in Heaven.

== Worship and prayer to Heavenly Mother ==
Orson Pratt, an early apostle of the LDS Church, opposed worshiping a Heavenly Mother, because, he reasoned, like wives and children in any household, Heavenly Mother was required to &quot;yield the most perfect obedience to&quot; her husband.

Early leader George Q. Cannon thought that &quot;there is too much of this inclination to deify &#x27;our mother in heaven, arguing that she is not part of the Godhead and that to worship her would detract from the worship of Heavenly Father. However, early 20th-century church leader Rudger Clawson disagreed, arguing that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t take away from our worship of the Eternal Father, to adore our Eternal Mother ... [W]e honor woman when we acknowledge Godhood in her eternal prototype.&quot;

Some church leaders have interpreted the term &quot;God&quot; to represent the divinely exalted couple with both a masculine and feminine half. Erastus Snow, an early Mormon apostle, wrote do you mean we should understand that Deity consists of a man and woman?&#x27; Most certainly I do. If I believe anything that God has ever said about himself ... I must believe that deity consists of a man and woman.&quot; This notion was reaffirmed by later church leaders Hugh B. Brown, James E. Talmage, Melvin J. Ballard, and Bruce R. McConkie.

Some Mormon feminists have adopted the practice of praying to the Heavenly Mother. However, LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley opposed this practice, saying that Mormons should not pray to the Heavenly Mother because Christ instructed his disciples to address the Heavenly Father in their prayers. When a feminist professor was fired from Brigham Young University in the 1990s, it was revealed that one of the reasons was her public advocacy of praying to Heavenly Mother. Other Mormon women have been excommunicated for similar publications such as teaching that Heavenly Mother is the Holy Ghost.

== Acknowledgment by the LDS Church ==
One early authoritative statement from the entire First Presidency on the subject is the &quot;origin of man&quot; letter on the 50th anniversary of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. The church also later implied the theology in the 1995 statement &quot;The Family: A Proclamation to the World&quot;, where the church officially stated that each person is a &quot;spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents&quot;. Similarly, the 2019 version of the Young Women Theme reads, &quot;I am a beloved daughter of heavenly parents, with a divine nature and eternal destiny.&quot; Other references to heavenly parents can be found in Latter-day Saint speeches and literature. In 2015, an official essay was published on the church website which surveyed 171 years of statements about a Mother in Heaven and confirmed that it is part of church doctrine.

=== Statements by church leaders ===
Various LDS Church leaders throughout the history of the church have spoken openly about the doctrine of a Heavenly Mother.

Brigham Young stated about Adam and Eve: &quot;I tell you more, Adam is the father of our spirits ... [O]ur spirits and the spirits of all the heavenly family were begotten by Adam, and born of Eve. ... I tell you, when you see your Father in the Heavens, you will see Adam; when you see your Mother that bore your spirit, you will see Mother Eve.&quot; (Since the LDS Church has formally denounced since the 1970s the Adam–God doctrine as taught by Young, today this statement is doctrinal only to certain groups of Mormon fundamentalists.) Young also preached that resurrected &quot;eternal mothers&quot; would &quot;be prepared to frame earths like unto ours&quot;.

Susa Young Gates, a daughter of Young and a women&#x27;s rights activist, stated that the &quot;great Heavenly Mother was the great molder&quot; of Abraham&#x27;s personality. &quot;Gates speculated that Heavenly Mother has played a significant role in all our lives, looking over us with &#x27;watchful care&#x27; and providing &#x27;careful training.

Early 20th-century church leader B. H. Roberts pointed out that the Heavenly Mother doctrine presents a &quot;conception of the nobility of women and of motherhood and of wife-hood—placing her side by side with the Divine Father.&quot; Apostle John A. Widtsoe, a contemporary of Roberts, wrote that the afterlife &quot;is given radiant warmth by the thought that ... [we have] a mother who possesses the attributes of Godhood.&quot; In 1894, &quot;Juvenile Instructor&quot;, an official publication of the LDS Church, published a hymn entitled &quot;Our Mother in Heaven&quot;. A 1925 First Presidency statement included the lines &quot;All men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother. ... [M]an, as a spirit, was begotten and born of heavenly parents . ... [and] is capable, by experience through ages and aeons, of evolving into a God.&quot;

There has also been some more recent discussion of Heavenly Mother by LDS Church leaders. In a speech given at BYU in 2010, Glenn L. Pace, a member of the LDS Church&#x27;s First Quorum of the Seventy, said, &quot;Sisters, I testify that when you stand in front of your heavenly parents in those royal courts on high and look into Her eyes and behold Her countenance, any question you ever had about the role of women in the kingdom will evaporate into the rich celestial air, because at that moment you will see standing directly in front of you, your divine nature and destiny.&quot;

== Controversy ==
According to historian Linda Wilcox, Heavenly Mother &quot;is a shadowy and elusive belief floating around the edges of Mormon consciousness&quot;. The lack of focused teaching and more information about her has caused speculation among Mormons that this de-emphasis may have a divine purpose, such as to avoid drawing attention to her and to preserve the sacredness of her existence. In 1960, an LDS seminary teacher published in a Mormon encyclopedia that &quot;the name of our Mother in Heaven has been withheld &quot;because of the way God the Father&#x27;s and Jesus Christ&#x27;s names have been profaned.

Margaret Merrill Toscano writes that &quot;[w]hile no General Authority has made an official statement denying belief in a Heavenly Mother nor stating that her existence is too sacred to discuss, several factors may influence the current trend that sees even a mention of Heavenly Mother as treading on forbidden ground. Members take their cues about what is acceptable doctrine from talks of General Authorities and official church manuals and magazines&quot;. These materials rarely mention Heavenly Mother directly. The publicly discussed church discipline of feminists like Lynne Kanavel Whitesides, Maxine Hanks, Janice Merrill Allred, and Margaret Toscano, all of whom were disciplined in part for statements related to the Heavenly Mother, may add to the general sense that discourse about her is strictly forbidden. However, Brigham Young University professor David L. Paulsen has argued that such a belief finds no official backing in statements by church leaders, and that the concept that the Heavenly Mother is consigned to a &quot;sacred silence&quot; is largely the result of a relatively recent cultural perception.

In 2016, McArthur Krishna and Bethany Brady Spalding wrote a children&#x27;s book that discusses Heavenly Mother. Krishna said in an interview, &quot;We all know that we have a Heavenly Mother. There’s no reason not to talk about this, and to celebrate what we know.&quot; Krishna pushed back against the idea of sacred silence by saying, &quot;Not once ... did a general authority ever say that we cannot speak of her because of her supposedly fragile nature. She is a goddess in might and dignity. And to consider her otherwise, I think, is disrespectful to Her.&quot;

Though LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley has said the prohibition on praying to Heavenly Mother in no way &quot;belittles or denigrates her&quot;, some feel that it makes her seem less important than Heavenly Father. Others assume that both heavenly parents are equally important and expect that more will be revealed when humanity is ready. Mormon fundamentalists believe that Heavenly Father has multiple wives, and that although humankind shares the same Heavenly Father, they do not all share the same Heavenly Mother.

The question of how Heavenly Mother is regarded ties into a larger set of questions among many Mormons about power in relationships between men and women. When asked why God said that Adam would rule over Eve, Hinckley said, &quot;I do not know ... My own interpretation of that sentence is that the husband shall have a governing responsibility to provide for, to protect, to strengthen and shield the wife. Any man who belittles or abuses or terrorizes, or who rules in unrighteousness, will deserve and, I believe, receive the reprimand of a just God who is the Eternal Father of both His sons and daughters.&quot; Hinckley then went on to reaffirm the equality of men and women: &quot;Each is a creation of the Almighty, mutually dependent and equally necessary for the continuation of the race. Every new generation in the history of mankind is a testimony of the necessity for both man and woman.&quot;

Author Charlotte Scholl Shurtz stated that the LDS Church&#x27;s emphasis on Heavenly Parents as a cisgender, heterosexual couple excludes transgender, nonbinary, and intersex members and enshrines heteronormativity and cisnormativity. She further said that current teachings ignore transgender, non-binary, and intersex people, and further deny exaltation and godhood to non-cisgender individuals. Former BYU professor Kerry Spencer Pray stated the teachings on heterosexual, patriarchal Heavenly Parents alienates queer and single people like her, and that Heavenly Mother does not communicate with Her children, and is presided over by Her husband. Mormon scholar Margaret Toscano said LDS teachings frame Heavenly Mother not as an individual, but subsumes her into the Heavenly Parent patriarchal family. Authors Bethany Brady Spalding and McArthur Krishna argued that the idea that a Heavenly Mother is too sacred to speak about in the LDS Church is culturally nonsense.

== Reported visions ==

Heavenly Mother is absent in the visionary experiences in Mormon scriptures. The only recorded visionary experience is related by Zebedee Coltrin and recorded in the journal of Abraham H. Cannon.

<text>Exercise physiology is the physiology of physical exercise. It is one of the allied health professions, and involves the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to exercise. Exercise physiologists are the highest qualified exercise professionals and utilise education, lifestyle intervention and specific forms of exercise to rehabilitate and manage acute and chronic injuries and conditions.

Understanding the effect of exercise involves studying specific changes in muscular, cardiovascular, and neurohormonal systems that lead to changes in functional capacity and strength due to endurance training or strength training. The effect of training on the body has been defined as the reaction to the adaptive responses of the body arising from exercise or as &quot;an elevation of metabolism produced by exercise&quot;.

Exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology, and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression.

== History ==
British physiologist Archibald Hill introduced the concepts of maximal oxygen uptake and oxygen debt in 1922. Hill and German physician Otto Meyerhof shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their independent work related to muscle energy metabolism. Building on this work, scientists began measuring oxygen consumption during exercise. Notable contributions were made by Henry Taylor at the University of Minnesota, Scandinavian scientists Per-Olof Åstrand and Bengt Saltin in the 1950s and 60s, the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory, German universities, and the Copenhagen Muscle Research Centre among others.

In some countries it is a Primary Health Care Provider. Accredited Exercise Physiologists (AEP&#x27;s) are university-trained professionals who prescribe exercise-based interventions to treat various conditions using dose response prescriptions specific to each individual.

== Energy expenditure==
Humans have a high capacity to expend energy for many hours during sustained exertion. For example, one individual cycling at a speed of through over 50 consecutive days expended a total of 1,145 MJ (273,850 kcal; 273,850 dieter calories) with an average power output of 173.8 W.

Skeletal muscle burns 90 mg (0.5 mmol) of glucose each minute during continuous activity (such as when repetitively extending the human knee), generating ≈24 W of mechanical energy, and since muscle energy conversion is only 22–26% efficient, ≈76 W of heat energy. Resting skeletal muscle has a basal metabolic rate (resting energy consumption) of 0.63 W/kg making a 160 fold difference between the energy consumption of inactive and active muscles. For short duration muscular exertion, energy expenditure can be far greater: an adult human male when jumping up from a squat can mechanically generate 314 W/kg. Such rapid movement can generate twice this amount in nonhuman animals such as bonobos, and in some small lizards.

This energy expenditure is very large compared to the basal resting metabolic rate of the adult human body. This rate varies somewhat with size, gender and age but is typically between 45 W and 85 W.
 Total energy expenditure (TEE) due to muscular expended energy is much higher and depends upon the average level of physical work and exercise done during the day. Thus exercise, particularly if sustained for very long periods, dominates the energy metabolism of the body. Physical activity energy expenditure correlates strongly with the gender, age, weight, heart rate, and VO2 max of an individual, during physical activity.

== Metabolic changes ==
=== Rapid energy sources ===
Energy needed to perform short lasting, high intensity bursts of activity is derived from anaerobic metabolism within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to aerobic respiration which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen is required for the resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominantly uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via glycogen phosphorylase into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic conditions is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time.

=== Plasma glucose ===
Plasma glucose is said to be maintained when there is an equal rate of glucose appearance (entry into the blood) and glucose disposal (removal from the blood). In the healthy individual, the rates of appearance and disposal are essentially equal during exercise of moderate intensity and duration; however, prolonged exercise or sufficiently intense exercise can result in an imbalance leaning towards a higher rate of disposal than appearance, at which point glucose levels fall producing the onset of fatigue. Rate of glucose appearance is dictated by the amount of glucose being absorbed at the gut as well as liver (hepatic) glucose output. Although glucose absorption from the gut is not typically a source of glucose appearance during exercise, the liver is capable of catabolizing stored glycogen (glycogenolysis) as well as synthesizing new glucose from specific reduced carbon molecules (glycerol, pyruvate, and lactate) in a process called gluconeogenesis. The ability of the liver to release glucose into the blood from glycogenolysis is unique, since skeletal muscle, the other major glycogen reservoir, is incapable of doing so. Unlike skeletal muscle, liver cells contain the enzyme glycogen phosphatase, which removes a phosphate group from glucose-6-P to release free glucose. In order for glucose to exit a cell membrane, the removal of this phosphate group is essential. Although gluconeogenesis is an important component of hepatic glucose output, it alone cannot sustain exercise. For this reason, when glycogen stores are depleted during exercise, glucose levels fall and fatigue sets in. Glucose disposal, the other side of the equation, is controlled by the uptake of glucose by the working skeletal muscles. During exercise, despite decreased insulin concentrations, muscle increases GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. The mechanism for increased GLUT4 translocation is an area of ongoing research.

glucose control:
As mentioned above, insulin secretion is reduced during exercise, and does not play a major role in maintaining normal blood glucose concentration during exercise, but its counter-regulatory hormones appear in increasing concentrations. Principle among these are glucagon, epinephrine, and growth hormone. All of these hormones stimulate liver (hepatic) glucose output, among other functions. For instance, both epinephrine and growth hormone also stimulate adipocyte lipase, which increases non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) release. By oxidizing fatty acids, this spares glucose utilization and helps to maintain blood sugar level during exercise.

Exercise for diabetes:
Exercise is a particularly potent tool for glucose control in those who have diabetes mellitus. In a situation of elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia), moderate exercise can induce greater glucose disposal than appearance, thereby decreasing total plasma glucose concentrations. As stated above, the mechanism for this glucose disposal is independent of insulin, which makes it particularly well-suited for people with diabetes. In addition, there appears to be an increase in sensitivity to insulin for approximately 12–24 hours post-exercise. This is particularly useful for those who have type II diabetes and are producing sufficient insulin but demonstrate peripheral resistance to insulin signaling. However, during extreme hyperglycemic episodes, people with diabetes should avoid exercise due to potential complications associated with ketoacidosis. Exercise could exacerbate ketoacidosis by increasing ketone synthesis in response to increased circulating NEFA&#x27;s.

Type II diabetes is also intricately linked to obesity, and there may be a connection between type II diabetes and how fat is stored within pancreatic, muscle, and liver cells. Likely due to this connection, weight loss from both exercise and diet tends to increase insulin sensitivity in the majority of people. In some people, this effect can be particularly potent and can result in normal glucose control. Although nobody is technically cured of diabetes, individuals can live normal lives without the fear of diabetic complications; however, regain of weight would assuredly result in diabetes signs and symptoms.

=== Oxygen ===

Vigorous physical activity (such as exercise or hard labor) increases the body&#x27;s demand for oxygen. The first-line physiologic response to this demand is an increase in heart rate, breathing rate, and depth of breathing.

Oxygen consumption (VO2) during exercise is best described by the Fick Equation: VO2=Q x (a-vO2diff), which states that the amount of oxygen consumed is equal to cardiac output (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by the quantity of blood distributed by the heart as well as the working muscle&#x27;s ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, this is a bit of an oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, it is not the only determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood must also be considered. Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise (ergogenic aids) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells (hematocrit), such as through blood doping or the use of erythropoietin (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive viscera to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction.

=== Dehydration ===
Dehydration refers both to hypohydration (dehydration induced prior to exercise) and to exercise-induced dehydration (dehydration that develops during exercise). The latter reduces aerobic endurance performance and results in increased body temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion, and possibly increased reliance on carbohydrate as a fuel source. Although the negative effects of exercise-induced dehydration on exercise performance were clearly demonstrated in the 1940s, athletes continued to believe for years thereafter that fluid intake was not beneficial. More recently, negative effects on performance have been demonstrated with modest (&lt;2%) dehydration, and these effects are exacerbated when the exercise is performed in a hot environment. The effects of hypohydration may vary, depending on whether it is induced through diuretics or sauna exposure, which substantially reduce plasma volume, or prior exercise, which has much less impact on plasma volume. Hypohydration reduces aerobic endurance, but its effects on muscle strength and endurance are not consistent and require further study. Intense prolonged exercise produces metabolic waste heat, and this is removed by sweat-based thermoregulation. A male marathon runner loses each hour around 0.83 L in cool weather and 1.2 L in warm (losses in females are about 68 to 73% lower). People doing heavy exercise may lose two and half times as much fluid in sweat as urine. This can have profound physiological effects. Cycling for 2 hours in the heat (35 °C) with minimal fluid intake causes body mass decline by 3 to 5%, blood volume likewise by 3 to 6%, body temperature to rise constantly, and in comparison with proper fluid intake, higher heart rates, lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs, reduced skin blood flow, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These effects are largely eliminated by replacing 50 to 80% of the fluid lost in sweat.

=== Other ===
* Plasma catecholamine concentrations increase 10-fold in whole body exercise.
* Ammonia is produced by exercised skeletal muscles from ADP (the precursor of ATP) by purine nucleotide deamination and amino acid catabolism of myofibrils.
* interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases in blood circulation due to its release from working skeletal muscles. This release is reduced if glucose is taken, suggesting it is related to energy depletion stresses.
* Sodium absorption is affected by the release of interleukin-6 as this can cause the secretion of arginine vasopressin which, in turn, can lead to exercise-associated dangerously low sodium levels (hyponatremia). This loss of sodium in blood plasma can result in swelling of the brain. This can be prevented by awareness of the risk of drinking excessive amounts of fluids during prolonged exercise.

== Brain ==

At rest, the human brain receives 15% of total cardiac output, and uses 20% of the body&#x27;s energy consumption. The brain is normally dependent for its high energy expenditure upon aerobic metabolism. The brain as a result is highly sensitive to failure of its oxygen supply with loss of consciousness occurring within six to seven seconds, with its EEG going flat in 23 seconds. Therefore, the brain&#x27;s function would be disrupted if exercise affected its supply of oxygen and glucose.

Protecting the brain from even minor disruption is important since exercise depends upon motor control. Because humans are bipeds, motor control is needed for keeping balance. For this reason, brain energy consumption is increased during intense physical exercise due to the demands in the motor cognition needed to control the body.

Exercise Physiologists treat a range of neurological conditions including (but not limited to): Parkinson&#x27;s, Alzheimer&#x27;s, Traumatic Brain Injury, Spinal Cord Injury, Cerebral Palsy and mental health conditions.

=== Cerebral oxygen ===
Cerebral autoregulation usually ensures the brain has priority to cardiac output, though this is impaired slightly by exhaustive exercise. During submaximal exercise, cardiac output increases and cerebral blood flow increases beyond the brain&#x27;s oxygen needs. However, this is not the case for continuous maximal exertion: &quot;Maximal exercise is, despite the increase in capillary oxygenation [in the brain], associated with a reduced mitochondrial O2 content during whole body exercise&quot; The autoregulation of the brain&#x27;s blood supply is impaired particularly in warm environments

=== Glucose ===
In adults, exercise depletes the plasma glucose available to the brain: short intense exercise (35 min ergometer cycling) can reduce brain glucose uptake by 32%.

At rest, energy for the adult brain is normally provided by glucose but the brain has a compensatory capacity to replace some of this with lactate. Research suggests that this can be raised, when a person rests in a brain scanner, to about 17%, with a higher percentage of 25% occurring during hypoglycemia. During intense exercise, lactate has been estimated to provide a third of the brain&#x27;s energy needs. There is evidence that the brain might, however, in spite of these alternative sources of energy, still suffer an energy crisis since IL-6 (a sign of metabolic stress) is released during exercise from the brain.

=== Hyperthermia ===
Humans use sweat thermoregulation for body heat removal, particularly to remove the heat produced during exercise. Moderate dehydration as a consequence of exercise and heat is reported to impair cognition. These impairments can start after body mass lost that is greater than 1%. Cognitive impairment, particularly due to heat and exercise is likely to be due to loss of integrity to the blood brain barrier. Hyperthermia can also lower cerebral blood flow, and raise brain temperature.

== Fatigue ==

=== Intense activity ===
Researchers once attributed fatigue to a build-up of lactic acid in muscles. However, this is no longer believed. Rather, lactate may stop muscle fatigue by keeping muscles fully responding to nerve signals. The available oxygen and energy supply, and disturbances of muscle ion homeostasis are the main factors determining exercise performance, at least during brief very intense exercise.

Each muscle contraction involves an action potential that activates voltage sensors, and so releases Ca2+ ions from the muscle fibre&#x27;s sarcoplasmic reticulum. The action potentials that cause this also require ion changes: Na influxes during the depolarization phase and K effluxes for the repolarization phase. Cl− ions also diffuse into the sarcoplasm to aid the repolarization phase. During intense muscle contraction, the ion pumps that maintain homeostasis of these ions are inactivated and this (with other ion related disruption) causes ionic disturbances. This causes cellular membrane depolarization, inexcitability, and so muscle weakness. Ca2+ leakage from type 1 ryanodine receptor) channels has also been identified with fatigue.

=== Endurance failure ===
After intense prolonged exercise, there can be a collapse in body homeostasis. Some famous examples include:
* Dorando Pietri in the 1908 Summer Olympic men&#x27;s marathon ran the wrong way and collapsed several times.
* Jim Peters in the marathon of the 1954 Commonwealth Games staggered and collapsed several times, and though he had a five-kilometre (three-mile) lead, failed to finish. Though it was formerly believed that this was due to severe dehydration, more recent research suggests it was the combined effects upon the brain of hyperthermia, hypertonic hypernatraemia associated with dehydration, and possibly hypoglycaemia.
* Gabriela Andersen-Schiess in the woman&#x27;s marathon at the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics in the race&#x27;s final 400 meters, stopping occasionally and shown signs of heat exhaustion. Though she fell across the finish line, she was released from medical care only two hours later.

=== Central governor ===
Tim Noakes, based on an earlier idea by the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill has proposed the existence of a central governor. In this, the brain continuously adjusts the power output by muscles during exercise in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in prior length of strenuous exercise, the planned duration of further exertion, and the present metabolic state of the body. This adjusts the number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, and is subjectively experienced as fatigue and exhaustion. The idea of a central governor rejects the earlier idea that fatigue is only caused by mechanical failure of the exercising muscles (&quot;peripheral fatigue&quot;). Instead, the brain models the metabolic limits of the body to ensure that whole body homeostasis is protected, in particular that the heart is guarded from hypoxia, and an emergency reserve is always maintained. The idea of the central governor has been questioned since ‘physiological catastrophes’ can and do occur suggesting that if it did exist, athletes (such as Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess) can override it.

=== Other factors ===
Exercise fatigue has also been suggested to be affected by:
* brain hyperthermia
* glycogen depletion in brain cells
* depletion of muscle and liver glycogen &quot;(see &quot;hitting the wall&quot;)&quot;
* reactive oxygen species impairing skeletal muscle function
* reduced level of glutamate secondary to uptake of ammonia in the brain
* Fatigue in diaphragm and abdominal respiratory muscles limiting breathing
* Impaired oxygen supply to muscles
* Ammonia effects upon the brain
* Serotonin pathways in the brain

== Cardiac biomarkers ==
Prolonged exercise such as marathons can increase cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and ischemia-modified (aka MI) albumin. This can be misinterpreted by medical personnel as signs of myocardial infarction, or cardiac dysfunction. In these clinical conditions, such cardiac biomarkers are produced by irreversible injury of muscles. In contrast, the processes that create them after strenuous exertion in endurance sports are reversible, with their levels returning to normal within 24-hours (further research, however, is still needed).

== Human adaptations ==
Humans are specifically adapted to engage in prolonged strenuous muscular activity (such as efficient long distance bipedal running). This capacity for endurance running may have evolved to allow the running down of game animals by persistent slow but constant chase over many hours.

Central to the success of this is the ability of the human body to effectively remove muscle heat waste. In most animals, this is stored by allowing a temporary increase in body temperature. This allows them to escape from animals that quickly speed after them for a short duration (the way nearly all predators catch their prey). Humans, unlike other animals that catch prey, remove heat with a specialized thermoregulation based on sweat evaporation. One gram of sweat can remove 2,598 J of heat energy. Another mechanism is increased skin blood flow during exercise that allows for greater convective heat loss that is aided by our upright posture. This skin based cooling has resulted in humans acquiring an increased number of sweat glands, combined with a lack of body fur that would otherwise stop air circulation and efficient evaporation. Because humans can remove exercise heat, they can avoid the fatigue from heat exhaustion that affects animals chased in a persistent manner, and so eventually catch them.

== Selective breeding experiments with rodents ==
Rodents have been specifically bred for exercise behavior or performance in several different studies. For example, laboratory rats have been bred for high or low performance on a motorized treadmill with electrical stimulation as motivation. The high-performance line of rats also exhibits increased voluntary wheel-running behavior as compared with the low-capacity line. In an experimental evolution approach, four replicate lines of laboratory mice have been bred for high levels of voluntary exercise on wheels, while four additional control lines are maintained by breeding without regard to the amount of wheel running. These selected lines of mice also show increased endurance capacity in tests of forced endurance capacity on a motorized treadmill. However, in neither selection experiment have the precise causes of fatigue during either forced or voluntary exercise been determined.

== Exercise-induced muscle pain ==
Physical exercise may cause pain both as an immediate effect that may result from stimulation of free nerve endings by low pH, as well as a delayed onset muscle soreness. The delayed soreness is fundamentally the result of ruptures within the muscle, although apparently not involving the rupture of whole muscle fibers.

Muscle pain can range from a mild soreness to a debilitating injury depending on intensity of exercise, level of training, and other factors.

There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that moderate intensity continuous training has the ability to increase someone&#x27;s pain threshold.

==Education in exercise physiology==

Accreditation programs exist with professional bodies in most developed countries, ensuring the quality and consistency of education. In Canada, one may obtain the professional certification title – Certified Exercise Physiologist for those working with clients (both clinical and non clinical) in the health and fitness industry. In Australia, one may obtain the professional certification title - Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP) through the professional body Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA). In Australia, it is common for an AEP to also have the qualification of an Accredited Exercise Scientist (AES). The premiere governing body is the American College of Sports Medicine.

An exercise physiologist&#x27;s area of study may include but is not limited to biochemistry, bioenergetics, cardiopulmonary function, hematology, biomechanics, skeletal muscle physiology, neuroendocrine function, and central and peripheral nervous system function. Furthermore, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers.

Colleges and universities offer exercise physiology as a program of study on various different levels, including undergraduate, graduate degrees and certificates, and doctoral programs. The basis of Exercise Physiology as a major is to prepare students for a career in the field of health sciences. A program that focuses on the scientific study of the physiological processes involved in physical or motor activity, including sensorimotor interactions, response mechanisms, and the effects of injury, disease, and disability. Includes instruction in muscular and skeletal anatomy; molecular and cellular basis of muscle contraction; fuel utilization; neurophysiology of motor mechanics; systemic physiological responses (respiration, blood flow, endocrine secretions, and others); fatigue and exhaustion; muscle and body training; physiology of specific exercises and activities; physiology of injury; and the effects of disabilities and disease. Careers available with a degree in Exercise Physiology can include: non-clinical, client-based work; strength and conditioning specialists; cardiopulmonary treatment; and clinical-based research.

In order to gauge the multiple areas of study, students are taught processes in which to follow on a client-based level. Practical and lecture teachings are instructed in the classroom and in a laboratory setting. These include:

*Health and risk assessment: In order to safely work with a client on the job, you must first be able to know the benefits and risks associated with physical activity. Examples of this include knowing specific injuries the body can experience during exercise, how to properly screen a client before their training begins, and what factors to look for that may inhibit their performance.
*Exercise testing: Coordinating exercise tests in order to measure body compositions, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength/endurance, and flexibility. Functional tests are also used in order to gain understanding of a more specific part of the body. Once the information is gathered about a client, exercise physiologists must also be able to interpret the test data and decide what health-related outcomes have been discovered.
*Exercise prescription: Forming training programs that best meet an individual&#x27;s health and fitness goals. Must be able to take into account different types of exercises, the reasons/goal for a client&#x27;s workout, and pre-screened assessments. Knowing how to prescribe exercises for special considerations and populations is also required. These may include age differences, pregnancy, joint diseases, obesity, pulmonary disease, etc.

===Curriculum===

The curriculum for exercise physiology includes biology, chemistry, and applied sciences. The purpose of the classes selected for this major is to have a proficient understanding of human anatomy, human physiology, and exercise physiology. Includes instruction in muscular and skeletal anatomy; molecular and cellular basis of muscle contraction; fuel utilization; neurophysiology of motor mechanics; systemic physiological responses (respiration, blood flow, endocrine secretions, and others); fatigue and exhaustion; muscle and body training; physiology of specific exercises and activities; physiology of injury; and the effects of disabilities and disease. Not only is a full class schedule needed to complete a degree in Exercise Physiology, but a minimum amount of practicum experience is required and internships are recommended.

<text>Boyle Heights is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, located east of the Los Angeles River. It is one of the city&#x27;s most notable and historic Chicano/Mexican American communities, and is home to cultural landmarks like Mariachi Plaza and events like the annual Día de los Muertos celebrations.

==History==

Historically known as Paredón Blanco (Spanish for &quot;White Bluff&quot;) during Mexican rule, what would become Boyle Heights became home to a small settlement of relocated Tongva refugees from the village of Yaanga in 1845. The villagers were relocated to this new site known as Pueblito after being forcibly evicted from their previous location on the corner Alameda and Commercial Street by German immigrant Juan Domingo (John Groningen), who paid Governor Pío Pico $200 for the land.

On August 13, 1846, Commodore Stockton&#x27;s forces captured Los Angeles for the United States with no resistance. Under American rule, the Indigenous were relocated, and the Pueblito site was razed to the ground in 1847. The destruction of Pueblito was reportedly approved by the Los Angeles City Council and largely displaced the final generation of the villagers, known as Yaangavit, into the &quot;Calle de los Negros&quot; (&quot;street of the dark ones&quot;) district.

The area was renamed for Andrew Boyle, an Irishman born in Ballinrobe, who purchased on the bluffs overlooking the Los Angeles River after fighting in the Mexican–American War for $4,000. Boyle established his home on the land in 1858. In the 1860s, he began growing grapes and sold the wine under the &quot;Paredon Blanc&quot; name. His son-in-law William Workman served as early mayor and city councilman and also built early infrastructure for the area.

To the north of Boyle Heights was Brooklyn Heights, a subdivision in the hills on the eastern bank of the Los Angeles River that centered on Prospect Park.

From 1889 through 1909 the city was divided into nine wards. In 1899 a motion was introduced at the Ninth Ward Development Association to use the name Boyle Heights to apply to all the highlands of the Ninth Ward, including Brooklyn Heights and Euclid Heights. XLNT Foods had a factory making tamales here early in their history. The company started in 1894, when tamales were the most popular ethnic food in Los Angeles. The company is the oldest continuously operating Mexican food brand in the United States, and one of the oldest companies in Southern California.
In the early 1910s, Boyle Heights was one of the only communities that did not have restricted housing covenants that discriminated against Japanese and other people of color. The Japanese community of Little Tokyo continued to grow and extended to the First Street Corridor into Boyle Heights in the early 1910s. Boyle Heights became Los Angeles’s largest residential communities of Japanese immigrants and Americans, apart from Little Tokyo. In the 1920s and 1930s, Boyle Heights became the center of significant churches, temples, and schools for the Japanese community. These include the Tenrikyo Junior Church of America, the Konko Church, and the Higashi Honganji Buddhist Temple; all designed by Yos Hirose. The Japanese Baptist Church was built by the Los Angeles City Baptist Missionary Society. A hospital, also designed by Hirose, opened in 1929 to serve the Japanese American community.
By the 1920s through the 1960s, Boyle Heights was racially and ethnically diverse as a center of Jewish, Mexican and Japanese immigrant life in the early 20th century, and also hosted significant Yugoslav, Armenian, African-American and Russian populations. Bruce Phillips, a sociologist who tracked Jewish communities across the United States, said that Jewish families left Boyle Heights not because of racism, but instead because of banks redlining the neighborhood (denying home loans) and the construction of several freeways through the community.

In 1961, the construction of the East LA Interchange began. At 135 acres in size, the interchange is three times larger than the average highway system, even expanding at some points to 27 lanes in width. The interchange handles around 1.7 million vehicles daily and has produced one of the most traffic congested regions in the world as well as one of the most concentrated pockets of air pollution in America. This resulted in the development of Boyle Heights, a multicultural, interethnic neighborhood in East Los Angeles whose celebration of cultural difference has made it a role model for democracy.

In 2017, some residents were protesting gentrification of their neighborhood by the influx of new businesses, a theme found in the TV series &quot;Vida&quot; and &quot;Gentefied&quot;, both set in the neighborhood.

==Demographics==

As of the 2000 census, there were 92,785 people in the neighborhood, which was considered &quot;not especially diverse&quot; ethnically, with the racial composition of the neighborhood at 94.0% Latino, 2.3% Asian, 2.0% White (non-Hispanic), 0.9% African American, and 0.8% other races. The median household income was $33,235, low in comparison to the rest of the city. The neighborhood&#x27;s population was also one of the youngest in the city, with a median age of just 25.

As of 2011, 95% of the community was Hispanic and Latino. The community had Mexican Americans, Mexican immigrants, and Central American ethnic residents. Hector Tobar of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said, &quot;The diversity that exists in Boyle Heights today is exclusively Latino&quot;.

Latino communities
==Latino political influence==

The emergence of Latino politics in Boyle Heights influenced the diversity in the community. Boyle Heights was a predominantly Jewish community with &quot;a vibrant, pre-World War II, Yiddish-speaking community, replete with small shops along Brooklyn Avenue, union halls, synagogues and hyperactive politics ... shaped by the enduring influence of the Socialist and Communist parties&quot; before Boyle Heights became predominantly associated with Mexicans/Mexican Americans. The rise of the socialist and communist parties increased the people&#x27;s involvement in politics in the community because the &quot;liberal-left exercised great influence in the immigrant community&quot;. Even with an ever-growing diversity in Boyle Heights, &quot;Jews remained culturally and politically dominant after World War II&quot;.

Nevertheless, as the Jewish community was moving westward into new homes, the largest growing group, Latinos, was moving into Boyle Heights because to them this neighborhood was represented as upward mobility. With Jews and Latinos both in Boyle Heights, these men, part of the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) — Louis Levy, Ben Solnit, Pinkhas Karl, Harry Sheer, and Julius Levitt — helped to empower the Latinos who either lived among the Jewish people or who worked together in the factories.

The combination of Jewish people and Latinos in Boyle Heights symbolized a tight unity between the two communities. The two groups helped to elect Edward R. Roybal to the City Council over Councilman Christensen; with the help from the Community Service Organization (CSO). In order for Roybal to win a landslide victory over Christensen, &quot;the JCRC, with representation from business and labor leaders, associated with both Jewish left traditions, had become the prime financial benefactor to CSO .. labor historically backed incumbents ... [and] the Cold War struggle for the hearts and minds of minority workers also influenced the larger political dynamic&quot;.

In the 1947 election, Edward Roybal lost, but Jewish community activist Saul Alinsky and the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) garnered support from Mexican Americans to bring Roybal to victory two years later 1949.(Bernstein, 243) When Roybal took office as city councilman in 1949, he experienced racism when trying to buy a home for his family. The real estate agent told him that he could not sell to Mexicans, and Roybal&#x27;s first act as councilman was to protest racial discrimination and to create a community that represented inter-racial politics in Boyle Heights.(Bernstein, 224).

This Latino-Jewish relationship shaped politics in that when Antonio Villaraigosa became mayor of Los Angeles in 2005, &quot;not only did he have ties to Boyle Heights, but he was elected by replicating the labor-based, multicultural coalition that Congressman Edward Roybal assembled in 1949 to become Los Angeles&#x27;s first city council member of Latino heritage&quot;. Further, the Vladeck Center (named after Borukh Charney Vladeck) contributed to the community of Boyle Heights in a big way because it was not just a building, it was &quot;a venue for a wide range of activities that promoted Jewish culture and politics&quot;.

==Government and infrastructure==

<text>Mary Ann Mobley (February 17, 1937 – December 9, 2014) was an American actress, television personality, and Miss America 1959.

==Career==
Mobley was born in 1937 in Biloxi, Mississippi. After her reign as Miss America 1959, Mobley embarked on a career in both film and television. She signed a five-year contract with MGM. She made her first television appearances on &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; in 1960, followed by five appearances on &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; from 1963 to 1965. In 1966 she was the female guest star on the first two-part episode of &quot;&quot;, in the episode “Old Man Out”. She went on to make multiple appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. She played a recurring role as Maggie McKinney Drummond on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; in the final season of the series, having taken over the role from Dixie Carter. She also played Arnold’s teacher on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; in season 2, episode 24. In Carter&#x27;s later series, &quot;Designing Women&quot;, Mobley guest-starred as Karen Delaporte, the snide head of a historical society, who crosses swords with Carter&#x27;s character, Julia Sugarbaker. She made two films with Elvis Presley in 1965, &quot;Girl Happy&quot; and &quot;Harum Scarum&quot;.

She was given the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress in 1965. She was active in many charitable causes and was awarded the Outstanding Young Woman of the Year Award in 1966 by Lady Bird Johnson.

Mobley also made occasional appearances on &quot;Match Game&quot; as one of the celebrity panelists from 1973 to 1977. 

She and her husband Gary Collins played Dr. and Mrs. Diller on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; S2 E6 &quot;Ship of Ghouls&quot; (1978). From 1984 to 1988, Mobley joined Collins in co-hosting the Pillsbury Bake-Off on CBS.

She appeared in the documentary film &quot;Miss America&quot;, which PBS aired as the January 27, 2002, episode of &quot;American Experience&quot;.

Mobley is briefly depicted in the third season of the Amazon Prime series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, played by Amanda Dela Cruz.

==Miss America==
Mobley was crowned Miss America 1959, the first Mississippian to achieve this honor, winning the national talent award.

Mobley joined husband Gary Collins as co-host of the 1989 Miss America pageant in September 1988, the 30th anniversary year of her own Miss America victory.

==Personal life==
Mobley grew up in Brandon, Mississippi, and graduated from Brandon High School. She was a member of Chi Omega sorority at the University of Mississippi, and in 1981 was inducted into the University of Mississippi Alumni Hall of Fame.

She married actor and television host Gary Collins in 1967 at Brandon United Methodist Church.

The couple separated in 2010 but reconciled and were living in Biloxi when Collins died on October 13, 2012. Collins and Mobley had one daughter together, Mary Clancy Collins. Mobley was also stepmother to Melissa Collins and Guy William Collins, children from his first marriage.

===Health and death===

<doc id="395510" wikidata="Q211656" url="?curid=395510" title="United Future">
<text>United Future New Zealand, usually known as United Future, was a centrist political party in New Zealand. The party was in government between 2005 and 2017, first alongside Labour (2005–2008) and then supporting National (2008–2017).

United Future was formed from the merger of the liberal party United New Zealand and Christian-dominated conservative Future New Zealand to contest the 2002 election. It was represented in the New Zealand Parliament from its foundation until September 2017. The party won eight seats in 2002; however it was reduced to three Members of Parliament in 2005. Between 2008 and 2017, United Future was solely represented in Parliament by party leader Peter Dunne, who represented the Ōhāriu electorate in Wellington. Dunne was re-elected during both the 2011 and 2014 general elections.

In August 2017, Dunne announced his retirement from politics prior to the 2017 general election. Damian Light was appointed as the new leader on 23 August. During the 2017 general election, United Future lost its sole seat in Parliament and attained only 0.1% of the party vote.

In November 2017, a leaked email announced that United Future would move to dissolve after a unanimous decision by the party board to do so. On 14 November an announcement was made on the party&#x27;s website signalling that the party had officially been dissolved. The party was formally de-registered on 28 February 2018.

==History==
===Formation and early success===
United Future was formed from the merger of liberal centrist party United New Zealand and Christian-dominated conservative Future New Zealand to contest the 2002 election. United, formed as a centrist party by a group of moderate Labour and National MPs, held one seat in parliament—that of Dunne. Future New Zealand, which was not represented in parliament, was a &quot;secularised&quot; evolution of the Christian Democrats, following the same basic principles as the Christian Democrats, but abandoning the explicit religious connection.

United Future&#x27;s first party president, Ian Tulloch, stated that &quot;United Future isn&#x27;t a Christian party – it&#x27;s a political party that has a lot of Christians in it, and a lot of non-Christians.&quot; Tulloch said that the &quot;universal principles of family, of common sense, of looking after one another, of compassion, integrity&quot; are equally valuable to both Christians and non-Christians.

Support for United Future, which was already growing in early 2002, was boosted further by Peter Dunne&#x27;s strong television debating performance and the public response to it. The uplift in United Future support during the last two weeks of the campaign caught many commentators by surprise and drew votes away from National, Labour and the Green parties, who were engaged in a public squabble over genetic engineering.

United Future made a strong showing in the 2002 election, taking 6.7 percent of the vote and eight seats: Dunne&#x27;s electorate seat of Ohariu-Belmont and seven list seats. It would have been assured of getting into parliament in any event, however; under New Zealand&#x27;s mixed-member proportional system, any party that wins at least one electorate seat qualifies for list seats even if it falls short of the five-percent threshold. The party faced a minor embarrassment after the election, however, when it was discovered that one of its list MPs, Kelly Chal, was not a New Zealand citizen, and thus ineligible to stand for parliament.

===Early activity===
After 2002 United Future in its family law reform proposals took to heart the trauma and adverse impact on children caused by the separation of their parents. United Future MP Judy Turner made clear that then current government policies were failing in regard to keeping both parents in children&#x27;s lives, and to this extent made a huge effort in promoting a member&#x27;s bill on mandatory mediation by means of a national roll-out of the North Shore Family Court &quot;Children in the Middle&quot; pilot programme.

In December 2004, United Future MPs exercised their individual conscience votes to oppose a bill to enable civil unions. This bill, which passed Parliament by a vote of 65 to 55, provided some marriage-like benefits for same-sex couples (who could not marry in New Zealand until August 2013) and for opposite-sex couples who choose not to marry. However, Peter Dunne alone among United Future MPs voted for the subsequent Relationships (Statutory References) Bill in March 2005, which passed by 76 to 44 votes and removed discriminatory wording from a range of statutes.

In mid-2004 United Future announced that it would contest the 2005 general election in partnership with Outdoor Recreation New Zealand. Cynics pointed out that, like Future New Zealand, Outdoor Recreation was a minor party with no prospect of reaching the 5% threshold (Outdoor Recreation gained 1.28% of the vote in the 2002 election) seeking parliamentary representation via the security of Peter Dunne&#x27;s electorate seat.

A month before the September 2005 election, list MP Paul Adams quit the party to stand as an independent in the East Coast Bays electorate. His daughter Sharee Adams, also on the United Future List, also quit to assist her father in his campaign. After the general election, disgruntled right-winger and ex-United Future MP Marc Alexander also voiced repeated criticisms of his former colleagues, in his &quot;Marc My Words&quot; political opinion column for &quot;Scoop&quot;, a New Zealand news website.

In the 2005 election, United Future had the support of the WIN Party, which was set up to fight the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants. WIN&#x27;s leader, John van Buren, was United Future&#x27;s candidate for Christchurch Central. This further spoke of alliances still to come. In this election, support plummeted to 2.8% and the party won only three seats. Peter Dunne retained Ohariu-Belmont, and Gordon Copeland and Judy Turner were returned on its party list.

United Future had tried to distance itself from its more assertive fundamentalist list MPs, such as Adams, Larry Baldock and Murray Smith. As Election New Zealand data revealed that the Outdoor Recreation Party still provided about 1% of the vote, 4.8% of the previous vote had gone elsewhere. During 2004–2005, the National Party had made renewed efforts to attract social conservative voters, through adoption of anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage voting records.

Following the 2005 election, New Zealand First and United Future entered into a confidence and supply agreement with Labour, under which Dunne became Minister of Revenue, outside Cabinet.

In March 2006 Outdoor Recreation New Zealand split with United Future, due to a dissatisfaction with what it saw as the Christian evangelism within the party. Outdoor Recreation acting chairman Phil Hoare said, &quot;We strongly believe in the traditional bedrock values of our nation&#x27;s heritage but we also affirm the separation of church and state.&quot; In 2006 several younger centrist members also departed from the party.

United Future, like most New Zealand Parliamentary parties, was caught up in the 2005 New Zealand election funding controversy. It voted in favour of the retrospective validating legislation, which was passed through the New Zealand Parliament in October 2006.
From February to April 2007, Peter Dunne exercised his own right to a conscience vote to support Sue Bradford&#x27;s private members bill against parental corporal punishment of children, while Gordon Copeland vigorously opposed it, as did Judy Turner, but on a more subtle level.

On 16 May 2007, Copeland resigned from the party due to his dissatisfaction with Dunne&#x27;s support for the aforementioned private members bill, although Turner did not follow suit. Copeland was subsequently part of forming the socially conservative Kiwi Party. Several other United Future members resigned in sympathy with Copeland, including former United Future List MPs Larry Baldock and Bernie Ogilvy. In 2011, the Kiwi Party ceased to exist as an independent entity after it merged with the Conservative Party of New Zealand, another conservative Christian dominated centre-right political party, currently unrepresented in Parliament.

On 13 August 2007 United Future unveiled a new logo which Dunne said was a revitalisation of the party before the 2008 election. The re-branding of the party was taken further on 3 September 2007 when Peter Dunne announced that United Future was becoming a moderate centrist party after the break with its former conservative Christian faction. Speaking of the departure of Copeland and the rest of the more strident Christians in the party, Dunne said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s taken a bit of a monkey off our back, frankly.&quot;

===2008 election===
In 2008 the United Future Party named candidates for 51 seats. Policies included tax cuts and various initiatives aimed at supporting parents, such as the extension of paid parental leave to 12 months; the option of income splitting for tax purposes for parents with dependent children and couples in which one partner relies on the other for financial support; and the promotion of shared parenting. There were also a number of health care policies including granting everyone one free health check per year.

Peter Dunne was re-elected as United Future&#x27;s only Member of Parliament. He retained his parliamentary seat of Ohariu-Belmont, but United Future did not poll sufficiently highly to bring additional caucus members into Parliament. Some Future New Zealand members defected from United Future to establish The Kiwi Party, which was unsuccessful in retaining parliamentary representation after the election.

The National Party won the most seats overall and formed a minority government with support from United Future, the Māori Party and ACT New Zealand. Dunne retained his portfolios as Minister of Revenue and Associate Minister for Health.

===2011 election===

In 2011 United Future campaigned on income splitting, flexible superannuation and restricting asset sales.

Peter Dunne retained the electorate of Ōhariu electorate, formerly Ohariu-Belmont. The Labour candidate Charles Chauvel accused Dunne and the National Party of an &quot;unprincipled political deal&quot; which encouraged National voters to give their electorate vote to Dunne to ensure his survival as an MP.

As in 2008, the National Party won the most seats overall and formed a minority government with support from United Future, the Māori Party and ACT New Zealand. Together with his previous Revenue and Associate Health portfolios, Dunne became Associate Minister of Conservation. The agreement included provisions barring the sale of Kiwibank or Radio New Zealand, and public consultation on United Future&#x27;s flexible superannuation policy.

===Temporary party de-registration===
On 31 May 2013 the Electoral Commission cancelled United Future&#x27;s registration at the party&#x27;s request after it failed to retain 500 members. The party became an unregistered party – unable to contest the party-list vote. However, on 10 June 2013, its party president made a media release stating that it had succeeded in attracting the needed 500 members for re-registration. It was subsequently reported that United Future was encountering difficulties over its re-registration, related to the need to acquire printed proof of sufficient membership, although Party President Robin Gunston had supplied the Electoral Commission with copies of traceable economic transactions associated with the influx of new members.

On 16 June 2013 the Electoral Commission noted that United Future had provided the aforementioned spreadsheet record, which contained names and details of putative party members. It noted that under Section 63 of the New Zealand Electoral Act 1993, &quot;bona fide&quot; registered political parties were bound to supply name, address, eligibility for membership, evidence of paid membership fees, member authorisation to record such details and to release them to a third party. The Commission stated that it would therefore accept signed and dated (although electronically submitted) membership forms from United Future and other eligible parties as evidence of membership enrolment. Signature and membership authenticity had yet to be assessed at that point

Events took a further turn when New Zealand Parliament Speaker David Carter ruled that as United Future could not guarantee that his party had 500 financially solvent members for another six to eight weeks after Dunne had submitted a membership list to the New Zealand Electoral Commission, Dunne would therefore have to sit as an &quot;independent&quot; Member of Parliament, and to forfeit NZ$100,000 parliamentary party leader operational funding unless and until United Future could conclusively establish whether or not it had sufficient membership to warrant re-registration. This occurred after New Zealand Labour Party MP Trevor Mallard contacted the New Zealand Attorney-General over the current legal status of United Future

On 8 July 2013 Dunne stated that his party had now been able to enrol sufficient members to satisfy the Electoral Commission&#x27;s random sampling techniques, although he also noted that the process of evaluation and re-enrolment would take six to eight weeks. At the same time, the New Zealand Electoral Commission verified that this was indeed the case and then clarified what would happen next. There would be an interim period when it checked the actual status of the party&#x27;s membership, then provided public notice of United Future&#x27;s membership application and invitation of comments, then provide the applicant party&#x27;s leadership with an opportunity to respond to the comments and then decide whether to refuse or approve the application from United Future On 30 July 2013, the New Zealand Electoral Commission requested input pending United Future&#x27;s ultimate re-registration

On 13 August 2013 the electoral commission accepted United Future&#x27;s re-registration.

===2014 election===
As in 2008 and 2011, the National Party won the most seats overall and formed a minority government with support from United Future&#x27;s single MP (Dunne) and the Māori Party.

===2017 election===
During the 2017 general election, United Future ran 8 electorate candidates and 10 list candidates. On 21 August 2017, leader and MP Peter Dunne announced that he was quitting politics at the election, citing recent polling and his perception that there was a mood for change in his seat of Ōhāriu. Damian Light was announced as the new leader on 23 August. During the 2017 election, United Future gained only 0.1% of the party vote and lost its sole seat in Parliament.

On 13 November 2017, an email was sent to party members, stating that a decision had been made at the previous weekend&#x27;s Annual General Meeting to disband United Future in light of poor electoral results and the unlikelihood of receiving enough votes to return to parliament in the future. On 14 November, Light and Dunne confirmed that United Future would be dissolving due to the loss of its Parliamentary presence. The party&#x27;s registration was cancelled on 28 February 2018.

==Policy==
United Future adopted the following mission statement in early 2007:
:&quot;United Future is a modern centre party, focused on New Zealand&#x27;s best interests. We promote strong families and vibrant communities. We seek a fair, and open society, free from poverty, ignorance and prejudice, and based on innovation, self-reliance, justice and integrity in business and personal dealings. We promote a sustainable environment, and a competitive economy which encourages growth, prosperity, ownership and opportunity through market policies where possible, and government where necessary. We want all New Zealanders, whatever their background, race or creed, to have the chance to enjoy everything that is good in our country.&quot;

<doc id="395513" wikidata="Q230935" url="?curid=395513" title="Annie Oakley">
<text>Annie Oakley (born Phoebe Ann Mosey; August 13, 1860 – November 3, 1926) was an American sharpshooter and folk heroine who starred in Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West.

Oakley developed hunting skills as a child to provide for her impoverished family in western Ohio. At age 15, she won a shooting contest against an experienced marksman, Frank E. Butler, whom she married in 1876. The pair joined Buffalo Bill in 1885, performing in Europe before royalty and other heads of state. Audiences were astounded to see her shooting out a cigar from her husband&#x27;s hand or splitting a playing-card edge-on at 30 paces. She earned more than anyone except Buffalo Bill himself.

After a bad rail accident in 1901, she had to settle for a less taxing routine, and she toured in a play written about her career. She also instructed women in marksmanship, believing strongly in female self-defense. Her stage acts were filmed for one of Thomas Edison&#x27;s earliest Kinetoscopes in 1894. Since her death, her story has been adapted for stage musicals and films, including &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;.

==Early life==
Annie Oakley was born Phoebe Ann (Annie) Mosey on August 13, 1860, in a log cabin less than northwest of Woodland, now Willowdell, in Darke County, Ohio, a rural county along the state line with Indiana. Her birthplace is about east of North Star. There is a stone-mounted plaque in the vicinity of the site, which was placed by the Annie Oakley Committee in 1981, 121 years after her birth.

Annie&#x27;s parents were Quakers of English descent from Hollidaysburg, Blair County, Pennsylvania: Susan Wise, born 1830, and Jacob Mosey, born 1799, married in 1848. They moved to a rented farm (later purchased with a mortgage) in Patterson Township, Darke County, Ohio, sometime around 1855.

Born in 1860, Annie was the sixth of Jacob and Susan&#x27;s nine children, and the fifth of the seven surviving. Her siblings were Mary Jane (1851–1867), Lydia (1852–1882), Elizabeth (1855–1881), Sarah Ellen (1857–1939), Catherine (1859–1859), John (1861–1949), Hulda (1864–1934) and a stillborn infant brother in 1865. Annie&#x27;s father, who had fought in the War of 1812, was 61 years old at the time of Annie&#x27;s birth and became an invalid from hypothermia during a blizzard in late 1865, dying of pneumonia in early 1866 at age 66. Her mother later married Daniel Brumbaugh, had another daughter, Emily (1868–1937), and was widowed once again.

Because of poverty following her father&#x27;s death, Annie did not regularly attend school as a child, although she did attend later in childhood and in adulthood. On March 15, 1870, at age nine, she was admitted to the Darke County Infirmary along with her sister Sarah Ellen. According to her autobiography, she was put in the care of the infirmary&#x27;s superintendent, Samuel Crawford Edington, and his wife Nancy, who taught her to sew and decorate. Beginning in the spring of 1870, she was &quot;bound out&quot; to a local family to help care for their infant son, on the false promise of fifty cents per week () and an education. The couple had originally wanted someone who could pump water and cook and who was bigger. She spent about two years in near slavery to them, enduring mental and physical abuse. One time, the wife put Annie out in the freezing cold without shoes, as a punishment because she had fallen asleep over some darning. Annie referred to them as &quot;the wolves&quot;. Even in her autobiography, she never revealed the couple&#x27;s real names.

According to biographer Glenda Riley, &quot;the wolves&quot; could have been the Studabaker family, but the 1870 U.S. census suggests they were the Abram Boose family of neighboring Preble County. Around the spring of 1872, Annie ran away from &quot;the wolves&quot;. According to biographer Shirl Kasper, it was only at this point that Annie met and lived with the Edingtons, returning to her mother&#x27;s home around the age of 15.

Annie began trapping before age 7, and shooting and hunting by age 8, to support her siblings and her widowed mother. She sold hunted game to locals in Greenville, such as shopkeepers Charles and G. Anthony Katzenberger, who shipped it to hotels in Cincinnati and other cities. She also sold the game to restaurants and hotels in northern Ohio. Her skill paid off the mortgage on her mother&#x27;s farm when Annie was 15.

=== Surname ===
There are a number of variations given for Oakley&#x27;s family name, Mosey. Many biographers and other references give the name as &quot;Moses&quot;. Although the 1860 U.S. census shows the family name as &quot;Mauzy&quot;, this is considered an error introduced by the census taker. Oakley&#x27;s name appears as &quot;Ann Mosey&quot; in the 1870 census and &quot;Mosey&quot; is engraved on her father&#x27;s headstone and appears in his military record; &quot;Mosey&quot; is the official spelling by the Annie Oakley Foundation, maintained by her living relatives. The spelling &quot;Mosie&quot; has also appeared.

According to Kasper, Oakley insisted that her family name be spelled &quot;Mozee&quot;, leading to arguments with her brother John. Kasper speculates that Oakley may have considered &quot;Mozee&quot; to be a more phonetic spelling. There is also popular speculation that young Oakley had been teased about her name by other children.

Prior to their double wedding in March 1884, both Oakley&#x27;s brother John and one of her sisters, Hulda, changed their surnames to &quot;Moses&quot;.

==Marriage and career==
Annie soon became well known throughout the region. On Thanksgiving Day 1875, the Baughman &amp; Butler shooting act was being performed in Cincinnati. Traveling show marksman and former dog trainer Frank E. Butler (1847–1926), an Irish immigrant, placed a $100 bet per side () with Cincinnati hotel owner Jack Frost that Butler could beat any local fancy shooter. The hotelier arranged a shooting match between Butler and the 15-year-old Annie, saying, &quot;The last opponent Butler expected was a 15-year-old girl named Annie.&quot; After missing on his 25th shot, Butler lost the match and the bet. Another account says that Butler hit on his last shot, but the bird fell dead about beyond the boundary line. He soon began courting Annie and they married. They never had any children.

According to a modern-day account in &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, it is possible that the shooting match took place in 1881 and not 1875. It appears the time of the event was never recorded. Biographer Shirl Kasper states the shooting match took place in the spring of 1881 near Greenville, possibly in North Star as mentioned by Butler during interviews in 1903 and 1924. Other sources seem to coincide with the North Fairmount location near Cincinnati if the event occurred in 1881.

The Bevis House hotel was still being operated by Martin Bevis and W. H. Ridenour in 1875. It opened around 1860 after the building was previously used as a pork packaging facility. Jack Frost did not obtain management of the hotel until 1879. The Baughman &amp; Butler shooting act first appeared on the pages of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; in 1880. They signed with Sells Brothers Circus in 1881 and made an appearance at the Coliseum Opera House later that year.

Oakley and Butler were married a year afterward. A certificate on file with the Archives of Ontario, Registration Number 49594, reports that Butler and Oakley were wed on June 20, 1882, in Windsor, Ontario. Many sources say the marriage took place on August 23, 1876, in Cincinnati, but no recorded certificate validates that date. A possible reason for the contradictory dates is that Butler&#x27;s divorce from his first wife, Henrietta Saunders, was not yet final in 1876. An 1880 U.S. federal census record shows Saunders as married. Sources mentioning Butler&#x27;s first wife as Elizabeth are inaccurate; Elizabeth was his granddaughter, her father being Edward F. Butler. Throughout Oakley&#x27;s show-business career, the public was often led to believe that she was five to six years younger than she was. The later marriage date would have better supported her fictional age.

=== Increase in popularity and touring ===
Annie and Frank Butler lived in Cincinnati for a time. Oakley, the stage name she adopted when she and Frank began performing together, is believed to have been taken from the city&#x27;s neighborhood of Oakley, where they resided. Some people believe she took on the name because that was the name of the man who had paid her train fare when she was a child.

They joined &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; in 1885. At five feet tall, Oakley was given the nickname of &quot;Watanya Cicilla&quot; by fellow performer Sitting Bull, rendered &quot;Little Sure Shot&quot; in the public advertisements.

During her first engagement with the Buffalo Bill show, Oakley experienced a tense professional rivalry with rifle sharpshooter Lillian Smith. Smith was eleven years younger than Oakley, age 15 at the time she joined the show in 1886, which may have been a primary reason for Oakley to alter her age as six years younger in later years due to Smith&#x27;s press coverage becoming as favorable as hers. Oakley temporarily left the Buffalo Bill show but returned two years later, after Smith departed, in time for the Paris Exposition of 1889. This three-year tour only cemented Oakley as America&#x27;s first female star. She earned more than any other performer in the show, except Buffalo Bill himself. She also performed in many shows on the side for extra income. During her lifetime, the theatre business began referring to complimentary tickets as &quot;Annie Oakleys&quot;. Such tickets traditionally have holes punched into them (to prevent them from being resold), reminiscent of the playing cards Oakley shot through during her sharpshooting act.

In Europe, she performed for Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, King Umberto I of Italy, President Marie François Sadi Carnot of France and other crowned heads of state. Oakley supposedly shot the ashes off a cigarette held by the newly crowned German Kaiser Wilhelm II at his request.

From 1892 to 1904, Oakley and Butler made their home in Nutley, New Jersey.

Oakley promoted the service of women in combat operations for the United States armed forces. She wrote a letter to President William McKinley on April 5, 1898, &quot;offering the government the services of a company of 50 &#x27;lady sharpshooters&#x27; who would provide their own arms and ammunition should the U.S. go to war with Spain.&quot;

The Spanish–American War did occur, but Oakley&#x27;s offer was not accepted. Theodore Roosevelt, did, however, name his volunteer cavalry the &quot;Rough Riders&quot; after the &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World&quot; where Oakley was a major star.

In 1901 (the same year as McKinley&#x27;s assassination), Oakley was badly injured in a train accident but recovered after temporary paralysis and five spinal operations. She left the Buffalo Bill show and in 1902 began a less taxing acting career in a stage play written especially for her, &quot;The Western Girl&quot;. Oakley played the role of Nancy Berry who used a pistol, a rifle and rope to outsmart a group of outlaws.

Throughout her career, it is believed that Oakley taught more than 15,000 women how to use a gun. Oakley believed strongly that it was crucial for women to learn how to use a gun, as not only a form of physical and mental exercise, but also to defend themselves. She said: &quot;I would like to see every woman know how to handle guns as naturally as they know how to handle babies.&quot;

=== Film appearance ===
Buffalo Bill was friends with Thomas Edison, and Edison built the world&#x27;s largest electrical power plant at the time for the &quot;Wild West Show&quot;. Buffalo Bill and 15 of his show Indians appeared in two Kinetoscopes filmed September 24, 1894.

In 1894, Oakley and Butler performed in Edison&#x27;s Kinetoscope film &quot;Annie Oakley&quot;, also known as &quot;&quot;Little Sure Shot&quot; of the &quot;Wild West&quot;&quot;, an exhibition of rifle shooting at stationary and moving objects, which was filmed November 1, 1894, in Edison&#x27;s Black Maria studio by William Heise. It lasted 21 seconds at 30 frames and 39 feet. It was the eleventh film made after commercial showings began on April 14, 1894.

=== Libel cases ===
In 1904, sensational cocaine prohibition stories were selling well. Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst published a false story that Oakley had been arrested for stealing to support a cocaine habit. The woman actually arrested was a burlesque performer who told Chicago police that her name was Annie Oakley.

Most of the newspapers that printed the story had relied on the Hearst article, and they immediately retracted it with apologies upon learning of the libelous error. Hearst, however, tried to avoid paying the anticipated court judgments of $20,000 () by sending an investigator to Darke County, Ohio, with the intent of collecting reputation-smearing gossip from Oakley&#x27;s past. The investigator found nothing.

Oakley spent much of the next six years winning all but one of her 55 libel lawsuits against newspapers. She collected less in judgments than the total of her legal expenses.

==Later years and death==
In 1913, the Butlers built a brick bungalow style home in Cambridge, Maryland. It is known as the Annie Oakley House and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 1917, they moved to North Carolina and returned to public life.

After World War I broke out, Oakley reflected, &quot;If I shot the kaiser, I might have saved the lives of several millions of soldiers. I didn&#x27;t know then that he would swing the iron fist and shake the universe. Perhaps it was well for both of us that humans lack foresight.&quot; According to Butler, he sat down and wrote a letter to the Kaiser Wilhelm, saying that Annie Oakley wanted to repeat the shot. The kaiser never replied.

Oakley continued to set records into her sixties and also engaged in extensive philanthropy for women&#x27;s rights and other causes, including the support of young women she knew. She embarked on a comeback and intended to star in a feature-length silent movie. She hit 100 clay targets in a row from at age 62 in a 1922 shooting contest in Pinehurst, North Carolina.

In late 1922, the couple were in a car crash that forced Oakley to wear a steel brace on her right leg. She eventually performed again after more than a year of recovery, and she set records in 1924.

Oakley&#x27;s health declined in 1925 and she died of pernicious anemia in Greenville, Ohio, at the age of 66 on November 3, 1926. She was cremated and her ashes buried at Brock Cemetery, near Greenville.

According to B. Haugen, Butler was so distraught by her death that he stopped eating and died 18 days later in Michigan; he was buried next to her ashes. Kasper reports that Butler&#x27;s death certificate gave senility as the cause of death. One rumor claims that Oakley&#x27;s ashes were placed in one of her trophies and placed with Butler&#x27;s body in his coffin prior. Both body and ashes were interred in the cemetery on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1926.

After her death, her incomplete autobiography was given to stage comedian Fred Stone, and it was discovered that her entire fortune had been spent on her family and her charities.

==Shooting prowess==
Biographers, such as Shirl Kasper, repeat Oakley&#x27;s own story about her first shot at the age of eight. &quot;I saw a squirrel run down over the grass in front of the house, through the orchard and stop on fence to get a hickory nut.&quot; Taking a rifle from the house, she fired at the squirrel, writing later that, &quot;It was a wonderful shot, going right through the head from side to side&quot;.
The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; notes that:

=== Association with Sitting Bull ===

R. A. Koestler-Grack reports that, on March 19, 1884, she was being watched by Chief Sitting Bull when:Oakley and Sitting Bull purportedly met and bonded while working together on a Buffalo Bill show in Minnesota. Sitting Bull joined with Buffalo Bill after being paroled, having led the last major Indian uprising against the federal government; his status as a great warrior and leader was legendary worldwide by the time he and Oakley met. The former Indian Chief was so impressed with Oakley&#x27;s skills that he offered $65 (equal to $ today) for a photograph of him and her together. According to Oakley, the admiration and respect was mutual and only increased as they spent more time together. Sitting Bull felt Oakley must be &quot;gifted&quot; by supernatural means, in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, Sitting Bull symbolically &quot;adopted&quot; Oakley as his daughter in 1884, naming her &quot;Little Sure Shot&quot; – a title that Oakley went on to use throughout her career.

==Legacy==
Oakley&#x27;s worldwide stardom as a sharpshooter enabled her to earn more money than most of the other performers in the Buffalo Bill show. She did not forget her roots after gaining financial and economic power. She and Butler together often donated to charitable organizations for orphans.

Oakley also proved to be a great influence on women. She urged that women serve in war, though President William McKinley rejected her offer of woman sharpshooters for service in the Spanish–American War. Beyond this offer to the president, Oakley believed that women should learn to use a gun for the empowering image that it gave. Laura Browder discusses how Oakley&#x27;s stardom gave hope to women and youth in &quot;Her Best Shot: Women and Guns In America&quot;. Oakley pressed for women to be independent and educated. She was a key influence in the creation of the image of the American cowgirl. Through this image, she provided substantial evidence that women are as capable as men when offered the opportunity to prove themselves.

A vast collection of Oakley&#x27;s personal possessions, performance memorabilia, and firearms are on permanent exhibit in the Garst Museum and the National Annie Oakley Center in Greenville, Ohio. She has been inducted into the Trapshooting Hall of Fame, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, the Ohio Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

<text>Emmett Dalton (May 3, 1871 – July 13, 1937) was an American outlaw, train robber and member of the Dalton Gang in the American Old West. Part of a gang that attempted to rob two banks in Coffeyville, Kansas, on October 5, 1892, he was the only member of five to survive, despite receiving 23 gunshot wounds. Two of his brothers were killed. After serving 14 years in prison for the crime, Dalton was pardoned. He later capitalized on his notoriety, both as a writer and as an actor. His 1918 serial story &quot;Beyond the Law&quot; was adapted as a like-named silent film in which he played himself. His 1931 book &quot;When the Daltons Rode&quot; was adapted after his death as a 1940 film of the same name.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Dalton was born in 1871 in Missouri to Lewis (1826–1890) and Adeline (&quot;née&quot; Younger) Dalton (1835–1925). Adeline Younger was a half-sibling of Henry Washington Younger, father of four brothers with the James–Younger Gang.

Emmett was the eighth born of nine brothers; they had three sisters. His siblings were:
* Charles Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Dalton (1852–1936)
* Henry Coleman Dalton (1853–1920)
* Littleton &quot;Lit&quot; Lee Dalton (1857–1942)
* Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Dalton (1859–1887)
* Gratton Hanley &quot;Grat&quot; Dalton (1861–1892)
* William Marion &quot;Bill&quot; Dalton (1863–1894)

* Eva May Dalton (1867–1939)
* Robert Rennick &quot;Bob&quot; Dalton (1869–1892)
* Leona Randolph Dalton (1875–1964)
* Nancy May Dalton (1876–1901)
* Simon Noel &quot;Si&quot; Dalton (1878–1928)
===Outlaw years===

Emmett&#x27;s older brothers Bob and Grat briefly worked as US deputy marshals in Indian Territory, sharing a position held by their older brother Frank Dalton after he was killed in the line of duty. They hired Emmett to serve as a guard at the jail at Fort Smith, in present-day Arkansas. The elder two started working for the Osage Nation to help them set up a police force, but fled after being pursued for stealing horses.

They began to conduct robberies of banks, stagecoaches, and trains. Emmett joined them, along with two other men. Their venture ended on October 5, 1892, when they attempted to rob two banks the same day in Coffeyville, Kansas. They had hoped to make enough money to flee the country. Four of the gang were killed in a gun fight with law enforcement and townsmen. Emmett Dalton was severely wounded, receiving 23 gunshot wounds, but survived. He later asserted that he never fired a shot during the Coffeyville bank robbery.

===Prison===
In March 1893, Dalton pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in the penitentiary in Lansing, Kansas. In June 1907, he was paroled in order to receive treatment to his right arm, which had been injured in Coffeyville. He returned to prison after treatment, then was pardoned in November 1907 by Edward W. Hoch, the Governor of Kansas.

===After prison===

Dalton moved to Southern California after leaving prison, and married Julia Johnson the following year, 1908. Later, he sold real estate, as Southern California was developing rapidly with migrants from across the country.

Dalton&#x27;s account of his exploits with his brothers, titled &quot;Beyond the Law&quot;, was published in 1918 as serial story in &quot;The Wide World Magazine&quot;, a London monthly. The serial was made into a like-named movie in which Dalton portrayed himself. In 1931, he published &quot;When the Daltons Rode&quot;, co-written with Jack Jungmeyer Sr., a Los Angeles journalist. It was adapted as a 1940 movie of the same name, starring Randolph Scott, Kay Francis and Brian Donlevy—Emmett Dalton was portrayed by Frank Albertson. He also appeared in &quot;The Man on the Desert&quot;.

Dalton died in July 1937 at the age of 66. His widow died in 1943, aged 73. They are buried in Kingfisher, Oklahoma.

<doc id="395522" wikidata="Q1266756" url="?curid=395522" title="Peter Dunne">
<text>Peter Francis Dunne (born 17 March 1954) is a retired New Zealand politician. 

Dunne was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ōhāriu electorate and its predecessors from 1984 to 2017, first as a member of the Labour Party from 1984 to 1994 before joining or leading a succession of minor centrist parties. He was the Leader of Future New Zealand from 1994 to 1995, United New Zealand from 1996 to 2000, and United Future from 2000 to 2017. He was four times appointed a minister in governments led by both the National and Labour governments in 1990, 1996, 2005 to 2013 and 2014 to 2017 and held the offices of Minister of Regional Development, Minister of Revenue and Minister of Internal Affairs.

Except for two terms (2002 to 2008), Dunne was the sole member of his party from the 1996 general election until his retirement at the 2017 general election. While the party continued to contest the election without him, it attained only 0.1% of the party vote and no seats in Parliament. In his retirement Dunne has appeared as a political commentator.

==Early life and family==
Dunne was born in Christchurch on 17 March 1954, the son of Ralph Esmond Dunne and Joan Claver Dunne. He attended St Bede&#x27;s College and gained an MA in political science from Canterbury University before studying business administration at Massey University.

In 1976, he married high school chemistry teacher Jennifer Mackrell, and they have two sons. His brother, John Dunne, is a radio broadcaster. A grandfather, Frank Smyth, played for the All Blacks. He worked for the Department of Trade and Industry from 1977 to 1978 and then for the Alcoholic Liquor Advisory Council until 1984. He served as deputy chief executive of the council from 1980 to 1984.

== Member of Parliament ==
===Labour MP===

In the 1984 election, Dunne was the Labour Party&#x27;s 30-year old candidate in Ohariu, held by the National Party&#x27;s Hugh Templeton, who was the trade and industry minister and a former revenue minister. Bob Jones, leader of the New Zealand Party also contested the seat, creating a three-way competition that enabled a Labour victory. Ohariu at that time was a young electorate, with two-thirds of residents aged under 35. In his maiden statement, delivered on 23 August 1984, Dunne spoke about the economic policy of the previous government which had led to high unemployment that was felt particularly by young people. He said: &quot;My generation has seen all the advantages that our parents fought to obtain for us whittled away, and we now see the next generation coming forward as one of the least privileged in our history. We are angry at the &quot;do nothing&quot; leadership that has allowed that to happen... Accordingly, it is little wonder that I find my spiritual home in the Labour Party as the embodiment of the commitment to positive change.&quot;

Dunne retained his seat in the 1987 election, after which he became a Parliamentary Undersecretary. In 1990, he became Minister of Regional Development, Associate Minister for the Environment, and Associate Minister of Justice. He won his seat again in the 1990 election, but the Labour Party suffered defeat, and Dunne thus lost his ministerial posts. In November 1990 he was appointed as Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for revenue, regional development and the environment by Labour leader Mike Moore.

In the 1993 election, Dunne won the seat of Onslow, which covered much the same area as his former Ohariu seat. He found himself, however, increasingly at odds with the majority of the Labour Party. Dunne tended to support Labour&#x27;s right-leaning faction rather than the party&#x27;s more unionist wing. With the departure of leading right-wingers like Roger Douglas, Richard Prebble and David Caygill he found himself isolated. In October 1994 Dunne resigned from the Labour Party, becoming an independent MP. Soon after he rebuffed an approach by National MP Christine Fletcher to join the National Party. A short time later, he established the Future New Zealand party (not to be confused with a later party of the same name).

===United New Zealand party===







In 1995, a group of MPs from both Labour and National decided to band together and form a new centrist party. Dunne, who had already quit his party in a similar way, decided to join the larger group. Together, the defectors and Dunne established the United New Zealand party, with a total of seven MPs, led by Clive Matthewson. United eventually established a coalition with the National Party, with the deal seeing Dunne return to Cabinet as Minister of Internal Affairs and Revenue.

United New Zealand hoped to take advantage of the new mixed-member proportional (MMP) system, which took effect for the 1996 election. However, that election saw United New Zealand almost completely wiped out. Dunne, by virtue of his personal support, won the newly formed seat of Ohariu-Belmont, but all other United MPs suffered defeat. As the sole surviving United member in the House, Dunne became the party&#x27;s leader. Towards the end of the parliamentary term, Dunne became part of a varied assortment of minor parties and independents who kept the National Party government in office after its coalition with New Zealand First collapsed in August 1998. Dunne retained his seat in the 1999 election. In this contest, the National Party put up no candidate in his electorate.

===United Future New Zealand party===
In 2000, Dunne&#x27;s United merged with the Future New Zealand party (not to be confused with Dunne&#x27;s own earlier party of the same name). Dunne remained leader of the new group, called United Future New Zealand. In the 2002 election, Dunne retained his seat despite challenges from both major parties. Mostly as a result of a strong performance by Dunne in a televised political debate, United Future surged unexpectedly in support, winning 6.69% of the nationwide party vote. In Parliament, United Future came to an agreement to support the governing Labour Party, although the two parties did not enter into a formal coalition arrangement. Dunne remained United Future&#x27;s leader.

===United Future New Zealand working with Outdoor Recreation===
United Future, like other minor political parties working in coalition, suffered in the polls. The United Future entered an agreement to work formally with the Outdoor Recreation Party, a registered political party formed to represent the views of hunters, fishers, trampers and recreational users of the marine and natural environment.

Dunne retained his seat in the 2005 general election but his party&#x27;s proportion of the nationwide vote diminished considerably, with a corresponding loss of seats in Parliament.

===Fifth Labour Government===
On 17 October 2005 Dunne gave his support to a Labour-led Government, along with Winston Peters&#x27; New Zealand First Party and Jim Anderton&#x27;s Progressive Party. Dunne&#x27;s decision to support a Labour-led Government disappointed some. During the election campaign Dunne and National Party leader Don Brash publicly sat outside an Epsom café over a cup of tea as a demonstration to the electorate that Dunne could co-operate with National. This demonstration saw the majority of National supporters in Ohariu-Belmont combine with United Future and other Dunne supporters to return Dunne with a comfortable majority. National won the party vote in his seat by 3.57% over Labour. Dunne&#x27;s party received 5.55%, while the Green Party, which Dunne had criticised heavily in the campaign, received 5.84%.

Don Brash expressed a lack of amusement with Dunne&#x27;s decision to support a Labour-led coalition government. Brash expressed astonishment at Dunne accepting the ministerial portfolio of Revenue while remaining outside Cabinet. Asked if he considered Dunne guilty of dirty dealing, Brash said he would not use those words. Representatives of business, however, welcomed the appointment.

After the 2005 New Zealand general election, United Future retained only two list Members of Parliament, Judy Turner and Gordon Copeland. Copeland left the party in May 2007 to re-form the Future New Zealand Party, after opposing Dunne over Sue Bradford&#x27;s private members bill against parental corporal punishment of children. After Copeland&#x27;s departure, Judy Turner remained the only United Future List MP in Parliament. Dunne supported Bradford&#x27;s Child Discipline Act.

===Fifth National Government===

United Future&#x27;s share of the party vote declined further in the 2008 election, to less than one percent. However, Dunne retained his electorate seat. The National Party won most seats overall and formed a minority government with support from Dunne, the Māori Party and Act New Zealand. Dunne retained his positions of Minister of Revenue and Associate Minister of Health. However, like ministers from the other support parties, he remained outside Cabinet.

Between December 2008 and August 2009, Dunne served as the chairman of the Emissions Trading Scheme Review Committee. Dunne described the committee&#x27;s report, which consisted of four minority reports, as a &quot;middle road&quot; through &quot;complex and contentious&quot; material.

In 2010, as Minister of Revenue, Dunne introduced the Taxation (Income-sharing Tax Credit) Bill to Parliament in September 2010, to give effect to United Future&#x27;s policy of allowing couples raising dependent children up to the age of 18 years to share their incomes for tax purposes. The Bill was referred to a select committee and was reported back to Parliament in March 2011, but never had a second reading. In April 2011, the government announced the establishment of a statutory Game Animal Council, another United Future initiative agreed to as part of the 2008 confidence and supply agreement.

Dunne has long argued for reform of the superannuation system, proposing a flexible system where people could retire earlier and receive less, or later and receive more.

During the fifth National government&#x27;s second term (2011–14), Dunne was reappointed Minister of Revenue and Associate Minister of Health, and gained an additional appointment as Associate Minister of Conservation. With the Government majority reduced, Dunne held the balance of power for more than ten pieces of legislation in that term, including the Government&#x27;s asset-sales plan.

As Associate Minister of Health, Dunne had responsibility for drugs, mental health and suicide prevention. He was responsible for the Psychoactive Substances Act 2013, which established a regulated market for psychoactive substances, and New Zealand&#x27;s National Drug Policy released in 2015. In 2015–17 he made moves to make cannabis-based medicines more available to New Zealanders.

As Minister of Internal Affairs between 2014 and 2017 Dunne extended the term of the New Zealand passport from 5 years to 10 years and led the development of an integrated national fire and emergency service, Fire and Emergency New Zealand, to replace the New Zealand Fire Service and the separate Rural Fire Service. He also oversaw the He Tohu project which saw three of New Zealand&#x27;s most precious constitutional documents – the 1835 Declaration of Independence, the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, and the 1893 Women&#x27;s Suffrage petition – rehoused in a purpose-built facility at the National Library.

==== Resignation and reinstatement ====
In mid-2013 Dunne refused to hand over all 86 emails between himself and Fairfax journalist Andrea Vance relating to the inquiry into the leaking of Rebecca Kitteridge&#x27;s GCSB report following its illegal spying on Kim Dotcom. Prime Minister John Key told Dunne that if he would not co-operate with the inquiry he would have to resign his ministerial positions – which he did on 7 June. However, in December 2013 Parliament&#x27;s powerful Privileges Committee found that Dunne was entirely within his rights to decline the Henry Inquiry access to his emails. It further described the actions of the Henry Inquiry as &quot;unacceptable&quot;, &quot;mystifying&quot; and &quot;unprecedented&quot;. The committee found &quot;failure at many levels&quot;, particularly as to why the Speaker of the House was not consulted, or at least informed, about the requests and information releases. In December 2014 the Chief Ombudsman ruled that the emails did not contain official information and were therefore not required to be released.

On 28 January 2014, Dunne was reinstated to the Executive as Minister of Internal Affairs, Associate Minister of Health, and Associate Minister of Conservation. He retained his portfolios on 29 September 2014, after the 2014 general election, in the third term of the National Party-led government.

==== Party registration status ====
On 31 May 2013 the New Zealand Electoral Commission de-registered the United Future Party at their request, following concerns the party no longer had the requisite 500 members. This meant Dunne was no longer the leader of a political party and was denied more than $180,000 in funding he had previously been allocated as a party leader. The Electoral Commission re-registered United Future as a political party on 13 August 2013. The Speaker of the House, David Carter, restored Dunne&#x27;s position as leader of a recognised Parliamentary party and re-allocated party funding in late August 2013.

==Honours and awards==
In 1990, Dunne was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2018 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a member of Parliament.

==Political philosophy==
Dunne supported Homosexual Law Reform when it became an issue in the mid-1980s. He has consistently favoured more liberal drinking laws. In a 2008 interview, Dunne suggested it may be time to review New Zealand&#x27;s abortion laws and leave the decision to a woman and her doctor, based on informed consent.

From 2007, Dunne rebranded United Future as a centrist party, based on promoting strong families and vibrant communities. Dunne has summarised his political views in two books, &quot;Home is Where My Heart Is&quot; (2002) and &quot;In the Centre of Things&quot; (2005).

Dunne supports a New Zealand republic, and holding an early referendum on the future of New Zealand&#x27;s head of state has become part of United Future&#x27;s policy programme. In 2004 he chaired the Constitutional Arrangements Committee. Dunne also supports the declaration of a &#x27;New Zealand Day&#x27; (renaming Waitangi Day) and has sponsored a member&#x27;s bill on the issue.

<text>Karkonosze County (; ) is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, south-western Poland. It came into being on January 1, 1999, as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998.

The county covers an area of . Its administrative seat is the city of Jelenia Góra, although this city is not part of the county (it forms a separate city county, which is an enclave within Karkonosze County). There are four towns within the county: Karpacz, Szklarska Poręba, Kowary and Piechowice. The first two of these are major ski resorts.

As at 2019 the total population of the county is 63,639, out of which the population of the towns totals 28,213 and the rural population is 35,426.

Until July 2020 it was named Jelenia Góra County (). The change formally took effect on January 1, 2021. The current name references the Karkonosze Mountains.

==Neighbouring counties==
Apart from the city of Jelenia Góra, Karkonosze County is bordered by Lwówek Śląski County and Złotoryja County to the north, and Jawor County and Kamienna Góra County to the east. It also borders the Czech Republic to the south and west.

==Administrative division==
The county is subdivided into nine gminas (four urban and five rural). These are listed in the following table, in descending order of population.

<doc id="395530" wikidata="Q1363925" url="?curid=395530" title="Battle of Port Arthur">
<text>The of 8–9 February 1904 marked the commencement of the Russo-Japanese War. It began with a surprise night attack by a squadron of Japanese destroyers on the neutral Russian fleet anchored at Port Arthur, Manchuria, and continued with an engagement the following morning; further skirmishing off Port Arthur would continue until May 1904. The attack ended inconclusively, though the war resulted in a decisive Japanese victory.

== Background ==
The opening stage of the Russo-Japanese War began with pre-emptive strikes by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) against the Russian Pacific Fleet based at Port Arthur and at Chemulpo. Admiral Tōgō&#x27;s initial plan was to swoop down upon Port Arthur with the 1st Division of the Combined Fleet, consisting of the six pre-dreadnought battleships , , , , and , led by the flagship , and the 2nd Division, consisting of the armored cruisers , , , , and . These capital ships and cruisers were accompanied by some 15 destroyers and around 20 smaller torpedo boats. In reserve were the cruisers , , , and . With this large, well-trained and well-armed force, and surprise on his side, Admiral Tōgō hoped to deliver a crushing blow to the Russian fleet soon after the severance of diplomatic relations between the Japanese and Russian governments.

On the Russian side, Admiral Starck had the pre-dreadnought battleships , , , , , , and , supported by the armored cruiser and the protected cruisers , , , , and , all based within the protection of the fortified naval base of Port Arthur. However, the defenses of Port Arthur were not as strong as they could have been, as few of the shore artillery batteries were operational, funds for improving the defenses had been diverted to nearby Dalny, and most of the officer corps was celebrating at a party being hosted by Admiral Starck on the night of 9 February 1904.

As Admiral Tōgō had received false information from local spies in and around Port Arthur that the garrisons of the forts guarding the port were on full alert, he was unwilling to risk his precious capital ships to the Russian shore artillery and therefore held back his main battle fleet. Instead, the destroyer force was split into two attack squadrons, one squadron with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd flotillas to attack Port Arthur, and the other squadron, with the 4th and 5th flotillas, to attack the Russian base at Dalny.

==Battle==
===Night attack of 8–9 February 1904===
At about 22:30 on Monday 8 February 1904, the Port Arthur attack squadron of 10 destroyers encountered patrolling Russian destroyers. The Russians were under orders not to initiate combat, and turned to report the contact to headquarters. However, as a result of the encounter, two Japanese destroyers collided and fell behind and the remainder became scattered. At circa 00:28 on 9 February, the first four Japanese destroyers approached the port of Port Arthur without being observed, and launched a torpedo attack against the &quot;Pallada&quot; (which was hit amidship, caught fire, and sank in shallow water) and the &quot;Retvizan&quot; (which was holed in her bow). The other Japanese destroyers were less successful; many of the torpedoes became caught in the extended torpedo nets which effectively prevented most of the torpedoes from striking the vitals of the Russian battleships. Other destroyers had arrived too late to benefit from surprise, and made their attacks individually rather than in a group. However, they were able to disable the most powerful ship of the Russian fleet, the battleship &quot;Tsesarevich&quot;. The Japanese destroyer &quot;Oboro&quot; made the last attack, around 02:00, by which time the Russians were fully awake, and their searchlights and gunfire made accurate and close range torpedo attacks impossible.

Of the sixteen torpedoes fired, only three hit their targets although it put the Russians&#x27; best ships out of commission for weeks, the &quot;Retvizan&quot; and the &quot;Tsesarevich&quot;. The protected cruiser &quot;Pallada&quot; was also hit. 

===Surface engagement of 9 February 1904===

Following the night attack, Admiral Tōgō sent his subordinate, Vice Admiral Dewa Shigetō, with four cruisers on a reconnaissance mission at 08:00 to look into the Port Arthur anchorage and to assess the damage. By 09:00 Admiral Dewa was close enough to make out the Russian fleet through the morning mist. He observed 12 battleships and cruisers, three or four of which seemed to be badly listing or to be aground. The smaller vessels outside the harbor entrance were in apparent disarray. Dewa approached to about of the harbor, but as no notice was taken of the Japanese ships, he was convinced that the night attack had successfully paralyzed the Russian fleet, and sped off to report to Admiral Tōgō.

Unaware that the Russian fleet was getting ready for battle, Dewa urged Admiral Tōgō that the moment was extremely advantageous for the main fleet to quickly attack. Although Tōgō would have preferred luring the Russian fleet away from the protection of the shore batteries, Dewa&#x27;s mistakenly optimistic conclusions meant that the risk was justified. Admiral Tōgō ordered the First Division to attack the harbor, with the Third Division in reserve in the rear.

Upon approaching Port Arthur the Japanese came upon the Russian cruiser &quot;Boyarin&quot;, which was on patrol. &quot;Boyarin&quot; fired on the &quot;Mikasa&quot; at extreme range, then turned and retreated. At around 12:00, at a range of about 5 miles, combat commenced between the Japanese and Russian fleets. The Japanese concentrated the fire of their 12&quot; guns on the shore batteries while using their 8&quot; and 6&quot; against the Russian ships. Shooting was poor on both sides, but the Japanese severely damaged the &quot;Novik&quot;, &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot;, &quot;Poltava&quot;, &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Askold&quot;. However, it soon became evident that Admiral Dewa had made a critical error; the Russians had recovered from the initial destroyer attack, and their battleships had steam up. In the first five minutes of the battle &quot;Mikasa&quot; was hit by a ricocheting shell, which burst over her, wounding the chief engineer, the flag lieutenant, and five other officers and men, wrecking the aft bridge.

At 12:20, Admiral Tōgō decided to run away and flee. It was a risky maneuver that exposed the fleet to the full brunt of the Russian shore batteries. Despite the heavy firing, the Japanese battleships completed the maneuver and rapidly fled out of range. The &quot;Shikishima&quot;, &quot;Mikasa&quot;, &quot;Fuji&quot;, and &quot;Hatsuse&quot; all took damage, receiving 7 hits amongst them. Several hits were also made on Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō&#x27;s cruisers as they reached the turning point. The Russians in return had received about 5 hits, distributed amongst the battleships &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot;, &quot;Pobeda&quot;, &quot;Poltava&quot;, and the &quot;Sevastopol&quot;. During this same time, the cruiser &quot;Novik&quot; had closed to within of the Japanese cruisers and launched a torpedo salvo. All missed although the &quot;Novik&quot; had received a severe shell hit below the waterline.

==Aftermath==
===Outcome===
Although the naval Battle of Port Arthur had resulted in no major warship losses, the IJN had been driven from the battlefield by the combined fire of the Russian battleships and shore batteries, thus attributing to them a minor victory. The Russians took 150 casualties to around 90 for the Japanese. Although no ship was sunk on either side, several took damage. However, the Japanese had ship repair and drydock facilities in Sasebo with which to make repairs, whereas the Russian fleet had only very limited repair capability at Port Arthur.

It was obvious that Admiral Dewa had failed to press his reconnaissance closely enough, and that once the true situation was apparent, Admiral Tōgō&#x27;s objection to engage the Russians under their shore batteries was justified.

The formal declaration of war between Japan and Russia was issued on 10 February 1904, a day after the battle. The attack, conducted against a largely unassuming and unprepared neutral power in peacetime, has been widely compared to the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.

In 1907, the Second Hague Conference adopted provisions regarding the rights and duties of neutral powers on land and sea, prohibiting nations from committing any acts of hostility against neutral countries or persons as well as requiring that a declaration of war be given before commencing the attack on a targeted party.

===Subsequent naval actions at Port Arthur, February–December 1904===
On Thursday 11 February 1904, the Russian minelayer started to mine the entrance to Port Arthur. One of the mines washed up against the ship&#x27;s rudder, exploded and caused the ship to sink, with loss of 120 of the ship&#x27;s complement of 200. &quot;Yenisei&quot; also sank with the only map indicating the position of the mines. The , sent to investigate the accident, also struck a mine and was abandoned, although staying afloat. She sank two days later after hitting a second mine.

Admiral Togo set sail from Sasebo again on Sunday 14 February 1904, with all ships except for &quot;Fuji&quot;. On the morning of Wednesday 24 February 1904, an attempt was made to scuttle five old transport vessels to block the entry to Port Arthur, sealing the Russian fleet inside. The plan was foiled by &quot;Retvizan&quot;, which was still grounded outside the harbor. In the poor light, the Russians mistook the old transports for battleships, and an exultant Viceroy Yevgeni Alekseyev telegraphed the Tsar of his great naval victory. After daylight revealed the truth, a second telegram needed to be sent.

On Tuesday 8 March 1904, Russian Admiral Stepan Makarov arrived in Port Arthur to assume command from the unfortunate Admiral Starck, thus raising Russian morale. He raised his flag on the newly repaired &quot;Askold&quot;. On the morning of Thursday 10 March 1904, the Russian fleet took to the offensive, and attacked the blockading Japanese squadron, but to little effect. In the evening of 10 March 1904, the Japanese attempted a ruse by sending four destroyers close to the harbor. The Russians took the bait, and sent out six destroyers in pursuit; whereupon the Japanese mined the entrance to the harbor and moved into position to block the destroyers&#x27; return. Two of the Russian destroyers were sunk, despite efforts by Admiral Makarov to come to their rescue.

On Tuesday 22 March 1904, &quot;Fuji&quot; and &quot;Yashima&quot; were attacked by the Russian fleet under Admiral Makarov, and &quot;Fuji&quot; was forced to withdraw to Sasebo for repairs. Under Makarov, the Russian fleet was growing more confident and better trained.
In response, on Sunday 27 March 1904, Tōgō again attempted to block Port Arthur, this time using four more old transports filled with stones and concrete. The attack again failed as the transports were sunk too far away from the entrance to the harbor.

On 13 April 1904, Makarov (who had now transferred his flag to &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot;) left port to go to the assistance of a destroyer squadron he had sent on reconnaissance north to Dalny. He was accompanied by the Russian cruisers , , and , along with the battleships &quot;Poltava&quot;, &quot;Sevastopol&quot;, &quot;Pobeda&quot;, and &quot;Peresvet&quot;. The Japanese fleet was waiting, and Makarov withdrew towards the protection of the shore batteries at Port Arthur. However, the area had been recently mined by the Japanese. At 09:43, &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; struck three mines, exploded and sank within two minutes. The disaster killed 635 officers and men, along with Admiral Makarov. At 10:15, &quot;Pobeda&quot; was also crippled by a mine. The following day, Admiral Togo ordered all flags to be flown at half mast, and that a day&#x27;s mourning be observed for his fallen adversary. Makarov was officially replaced by Admiral Nikolai Skrydlov on 1 April 1904; however, Skrydlov was unable to reach his command due to the Japanese blockade, and remained at Vladivostok overseeing command of the Vladivostok cruiser squadron until recalled to St Petersburg on 20 December.

On 3 May 1904, Admiral Togo made his third and final attempt at blocking the entrance to Port Arthur, this time with eight old transports. This attempt also failed, but Togo proclaimed it to be a success, thus clearing the way for the Japanese Second Army to land in Manchuria. Although Port Arthur was as good as blocked, due to the lack of initiative by Makarov&#x27;s successors, Japanese naval losses began to mount, largely due to Russian mines. On 15 May, two Japanese battleships, the 12,320-ton and the 15,300-ton , sank in a Russian minefield off Port Arthur after they both struck at least two mines each, eliminating one-third of Japan&#x27;s battleship force, the worst day for the Japanese Navy during the war.

Further naval operations from Port Arthur resulted in two break-out attempts by the Russians. The first was on 23 June 1904, and the second on 10 August, the latter of which resulted in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, which was tactically inconclusive. Afterwards, the Russian fleet did not make any more attempts to break out from their port, while the Japanese fleet dominated the waters for the duration of the war. But mines laid by Russian minelayers were a continuing problem for the IJN and resulted in more losses. On 18 September 1904, the 2,150-ton gunboat struck a Russian mine west of Port Arthur and sank. The same fate befell the 2,440-ton cruiser on 30 November in the same minefield, and on 13 December, the 4,160-ton cruiser sank in another Russian minefield a few miles south of Port Arthur while giving naval gunfire support to the Japanese armies now besieging the port.

<doc id="395538" wikidata="Q2074777" url="?curid=395538" title="Sinclair BASIC">
<text>Sinclair BASIC is a dialect of the programming language BASIC used in the 8-bit home computers from Sinclair Research, Timex Sinclair and Amstrad. The Sinclair BASIC interpreter was written by Nine Tiles Networks Ltd.

Designed to run in only 1 KB of RAM, the system makes a number of decisions to lower memory usage. This led to one of Sinclair BASIC&#x27;s most notable features, that the keywords were entered using single keystrokes; each of the possible keywords was mapped to a key on the keyboard, when pressed, the token would be placed into memory while the entire keyword was printed out on-screen. This made code entry easier whilst simplifying the parser.

The original ZX80 version supported only integer mathematics, which partially made up for some of the memory-saving design notes which had negative impact on performance. When the system was ported to the ZX81 in 1981, a full floating point implementation was added. This version was very slow, among the slowest BASICs on the market at the time, but given the limited capabilities of the machine, this was not a serious concern. The low speed was not mainly due to an inefficient interpreter though, it was an effect of the fact that 70-80% of the machine cycles were consumed by the video hardware. So the Z80 in the ZX81 clocked at 3.25 MHz was &quot;in effect&quot; running at well below 1 MHz from the perspective of the BASIC system.

Performance became a more serious issue with the release of the ZX Spectrum in 1983, which ran too slowly to make full use of the machine&#x27;s new features. This led to an entirely new BASIC for the following Sinclair QL, as well as a number of 3rd-party BASICs for the Spectrum and its various clones. The original version continued to be modified and ported in the post-Sinclair era.

==History==
Clive Sinclair initially met with John Grant, the owner of Nine Tiles, in April 1979 to discuss a BASIC for Sinclair&#x27;s new computer concept. Sinclair was inspired to make a new machine after watching his son enjoy their TRS-80, but that machine&#x27;s £500 price tag appeared to be a serious limit on its popularity. He wanted a new kit that would expand on their previous MK14 and feature a built-in BASIC at the target price of £79.95. To meet this price point, the machine would ship with only 1 KB of RAM and 4 KB of ROM. Grant suggested using the Forth language instead, but the budget precluded this. Grant wrote the BASIC interpreter between June and July 1979, but the code initially came in at 5 KB and he spent the next month trimming it down. It was initially an incomplete implementation of the 1978 American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Minimal BASIC standard with integer arithmetic only, termed 4K BASIC.

Even before the ZX80 was introduced in February 1980, the constant downward price-pressure in the industry was allowing the already inexpensive design to be further reduced in complexity and cost. In particular, many of the separate circuits in the ZX80 were re-implemented in a single uncommitted logic array from Ferranti, which allowed the price to be reduced to only £49.95 while increasing the size of the ROM to 8 KB. This work was assigned to Steve Vickers, who joined Nine Tiles in January 1980. Whilst Grant worked on the code interfacing with hardware, Vickers used the larger space to introduce floating-point arithmetic and a suite of trig functions, which were expected of any BASIC from that era, producing 8K BASIC. The initial version did not support the ZX Printer and had a bug in its square root function. Nine Tiles provided a new version to address these, but Sinclair was slow to include the new version in the ROMs. The new ROMs were eventually offered to owners of the earlier ZX80 as well.

When Sinclair lost the contest to build the BBC Computer, he moved ahead with plans to produce a low-cost colour-capable machine that emerged as the ZX Spectrum of April 1982. ROM space would once again be increased, this time to 16 KB. In keeping with his philosophy of making systems for the lowest possible expenditure, Sinclair wanted the absolute minimum changes to the existing 8K BASIC. Although Nine Tiles felt that something much better would be needed for the new machine, the schedule would not allow it, and yet another expansion of the original code was produced. Due to the RAM also being increased, to 48 KB, this version was known as 48K BASIC and eventually 48 BASIC with the introduction of the ZX Spectrum 128 at which time the 16 KB Spectrum was no longer sold and most existing ones in use had been upgraded to 48 KB. The new version was available near the end of 1981, but it was &quot;depressingly slow&quot; and &quot;snail like&quot;. Additionally, as no prototypes were available until the end of the year, it lacked support for the new line of peripherals Sinclair was planning.

In February 1982, Nine Tiles began to have disagreements with Sinclair over owed royalties for the various manuals that Nine Tiles had produced. Around the same time, Vickers and his Sinclair counterpart, Richard Altwasser, left their respective companies to start the Jupiter Ace project. When the Spectrum was launched the ROM was still not complete, and although Nine Tiles continued working on it until April 1982, by that point 75,000 Spectrums had already been sold and the project was cancelled. The missing functionality was later added by additional code in the ZX Interface 1. After Nine Tiles and Sinclair went their own ways, several new versions of 48 BASIC were created.

In 1983, as part of introducing the Spectrum to the US market as the TS2068, Timex modified it as T/S 2000 BASIC. The new version was incapable of running many Spectrum programs due to the memory location of machine&#x27;s functions moving. A similar, but somewhat more compatible version, was introduced as part of the Spanish Spectrum 128 of 1985, 128 BASIC.

Amstrad purchased Sinclair Research in 1986. As Sinclair had never owned the copyright to the language, Amstrad had to arrange a new license with Nine Tiles. Several other versions also appeared in this period as various extensions and clones of the Spectrum were introduced. These included +3 BASIC, BASIC64 and Timex Extended Basic. 

As of 2015, interpreters exist for modern operating systems, and older systems, that allow Sinclair Basic to be used easily.

==Description==
===Program editing===
Like most home-computer BASICs, Sinclair BASIC is anchored around its line editor. When the machine is booted, it runs BASIC and displays an inverse video &quot;K&quot; at the bottom of the screen to indicate the entry point. When a line is entered and the key is pressed, it either runs immediately if it does not have a line number prefix, or clears the screen and performs the equivalent of a command, placing a &quot;&gt;&quot; cursor after the line number in the most recently entered line.

In contrast to most machines of the era, the editor does not allow freeform editing at any point on the screen. Instead, when the user presses , the current line of code is copied back to the bottom of the screen. The user can move horizontally through this line using the cursor keys and commits their changes by pressing again. In contrast, on machines like the Commodore 64 or Atari 8-bit computers, the up and down keys can be used to move among the lines in the program and edit them in-place.

The most notable feature of the editor is that keywords are entered using single keystrokes. For instance, on the ZX81, the key on the keyboard would cause the entire keyword to be entered into the currently editing line. Once a keyword has been entered, the cursor changes to an &quot;L&quot; to indicate what follows will be interpreted as normal text. For instance, pressing again at this point would enter a single letter &quot;P&quot;.

Keys generally had two separate keywords assigned to them one above it and one below. Pressing the key in &quot;K&quot; mode would enter the keyword above the key, like for . If the system was in &quot;L&quot; mode, one could return to &quot;K&quot; by pressing the shift key the systems did not initially support lowercase text, so the shift was not otherwise needed. The keywords below the keys required a second keystroke, , which put the editor into &quot;function mode&quot;, changing the cursor to an &quot;F&quot;. Entering common code often resulted in a significant number of keystrokes.

The system has the advantage of representing all multi-character keywords as a single character in memory, which was a significant savings in the early machines that shipped with only 1 KB of RAM. This single-character representation included multi-character items like . This has the added advantages of simplifying the runtime, as it can immediately determine whether a character in the source code is a keyword or text, and also means that keywords are never entered directly, meaning that one can, for instance, have a variable named &quot;PRINT&quot;, as the system can determine that it is not the same as the keyword.

As the systems evolved and added new keywords, the entry system became increasingly difficult to use. 48 BASIC in the Spectrum required every key to host up to four keywords. Entering keywords was a time-consuming process of looking over the relatively small type on the keyboard for the appropriate key, and then correctly entering the multiple keystrokes needed to enter it properly. For instance, entering required one to type to access extended mode (later models include a separate key), keeping held down, and then and pressing . To improve the complex entry on the Spectrum, the keywords were colour-coded to indicate the required mode:
* : key only
* on the key itself: plus the key
* above the key: followed by the key
* below the key: followed by plus the key

This concept had run its course, and later machines running 128 BASIC (ZX Spectrum 128, +2, +3, +2A, and +2B) featured a more traditional editor where the user typed-in the keyword as individual characters, similar to other home computers of the era. This required a new tokenizer to convert the line into a similar internal format.

The resulting in-memory storage of the program was otherwise similar to Microsoft BASIC, in that only the keywords are presented as tokens, while non-keywords like string and numeric constants and variable names are left in their original typed-in format. However, that typed-in format was not ASCII, but an internal character code that contains both printable characters and the keyword tokens. Although portions of the table, the capital letters A to Z, for instance, are in the same order as in ASCII, their characters correspond to different numeric values, i.e. their code points&#x27; offset from zero is different from ASCII&#x27;s offset of 65. Other characters, like punctuation, may have been moved about even more. The ZX Spectrum character set is the most prominent example of such a character code. Related computers running Sinclair BASIC used similar variants, e.g. the ZX80 or ZX81 character sets. All of these different but related character sets included Sinclair BASIC tokens.

===Data types===
One uncommon feature of Sinclair BASIC is the way it stores variables in memory. Typically, interpreters use a fixed-size entry to hold data, making it easy to scan the variable table. Due to the extremely limited memory of the ZX series, any wasted space had to be avoided, and this led to the use of a variable-length format. The data types included numbers stored in a 5-byte values, strings with a length and then the characters, and arrays of both of those types. The data was stored in the table itself, which contrasts with most BASICs of the era, where strings and array entries were stored in a separate heap.

The first byte for a variable entry always held the type in the first three bits, and the first character of the name in the next five bits. As was the case in most microcomputer dialects, codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4 were all different variables and could store different values. Most variables could only have a single-character name; the exception are numeric variables (not arrays), where an alternate format held the first character of the name in those same five bits, but was then followed by additional characters ending with one with its high-bit set. Long variable names were whitespace-independent, and case-insensitive in later versions, so LET Number Of Apples = 5 is the same as LET numberofapples = 5 referred to the same variable.

The downside to this approach is that scanning the table to look up the value of a variable reference is more complex. In addition to testing whether the name matches using the subset of the first byte, if the entry is not the one that is being looked for, the type has to be read from the upper three bits and then the next location of a variable in storage calculated using the type. For instance, if the program encounters the variable &quot;A&quot; and the table starts with the entry for &quot;B$&quot;, it fails to match A with B, then reads the type to see it is a string, and then has to read the following length byte and skip forward by that amount of bytes to find the next entry in the table. To make this somewhat easier, arrays also stored a two-byte length, so the entire structure could be skipped over more easily.

A unique feature was the &quot;short float&quot;, or integer type. Any numeric variable could store either type, the storage itself did not change and used 5 bytes in either case. Integers were indicated by setting the exponent byte to zero, while floating-point values were stored with an excess-128 format exponent. This meant that it could not store zero as a float and lost one possible exponent magnitude. It also did not use any less memory, as the values were still 5-byte in memory. The advantage to this format is performance; the math library included tests to look for the zero exponent, and if it was seen, it would not attempt to perform various operations on the remaining 3 bytes under certain conditions.

===Keyword details===
The ZX81 8K BASIC used the shorter forms codice_5, codice_6, codice_7 and codice_8, whereas the Spectrum 48 BASIC used the longer forms codice_9, codice_10, codice_11 and codice_12. The ZX80 4K BASIC also used these longer forms but differed by using the spelling codice_13. The ZX81 8K BASIC was the only version to use codice_14, codice_15, codice_16 and codice_17. The ZX80 4K BASIC had the exclusive function codice_18; it was equivalent to the string operator in later versions.

Unique code points are assigned in the ZX80 character set, ZX81 character set and ZX Spectrum character set for each keyword or multi-character operator, i.e. codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22 (tokenized on the ZX81 only), codice_23 (replaced with codice_24 on the Spectrum). These are expanded by referencing a token table in ROM. Thus, a keyword uses one byte of memory only, a significant saving over traditional letter-by-letter storage. This also meant that the BASIC interpreter could quickly determine any command or function by evaluating one byte, and that the keywords need not be &quot;reserved words&quot; like in other BASIC dialects or other programming languages, e.g., it is allowed to define a variable named codice_25 and output its value with codice_26. This is also related to the syntax requirement that every line start with a command keyword, and pressing the one keypress for that command at the start of a line changes the editor from command mode to letter mode. Thus, variable assignment requires LET (i.e., LET a=1 not only a=1). This practice is also different from other BASIC dialects. Further, it meant that unlike other BASIC dialects, the interpreter needed no parentheses to identify functions; codice_27 was sufficient, no codice_28 needed (though the latter was allowed). The 4K BASIC ROM of the ZX80 had a short list of exceptions to this: the functions codice_29, codice_30, codice_18, codice_32, codice_33, codice_34, codice_35 and codice_36 did not have one-byte tokens but were typed in letter-by-letter and required the parentheses. They were listed as the INTEGRAL FUNCTIONS on a label above and to the right of the keyboard.

128 BASIC, present on ZX Spectrum 128, +2, +3, +2A, and +2B, stored keywords internally in one-byte code points, but used a conventional letter-by-letter BASIC input system. It also introduced two new commands:

* codice_37, which operated the 128k models&#x27; General Instrument AY-3-8910 music chip
* codice_38, which switched the 128k Spectrum into a 48k Spectrum compatibility mode

The original Spanish ZX Spectrum 128 included four additional BASIC editor commands in Spanish, one of which was undocumented:

* codice_39 (to edit a line number or invoke the full screen string editor)
* codice_40 (to renumber the program lines)
* codice_41 (to delete program lines)
* codice_42 (to set the column width of the RS-232 device, but undocumented as the code was broken)

Unlike the codice_43, codice_44 and codice_45 functions used in the ubiquitous Microsoft BASIC dialects for home computers, parts of strings in Sinclair BASIC are accessed by numeric range. For example, gives a substring starting with the 5th and ending with the 10th character of the variable codice_46. Thus, it is possible to replace the codice_43 and codice_45 commands by simply omitting the left or right array position respectively; for example is equivalent to codice_49. Further, codice_50 alone is enough to replace codice_51.

<text>Hiiu County ( or &quot;Hiiumaa&quot;) is one of 15 counties of Estonia, being the smallest county both in terms of area and population. It consists of Hiiumaa (German and ), the second largest island of Estonia, and several smaller islands near it. The county borders Lääne County to the east and Saare County to the south.

== History ==
Human habitation of Hiiumaa can be traced back to the fifth millennium BC. Mesolithic sites in Kõpu peninsula are exemplified by the seal-hunters&#x27; settlements. There are several well-preserved grave fields of the Iron Age. The island was first mentioned in 1228, in annals written under the name &quot;Dageida&quot;. In 1254, Hiiumaa was divided between the Livonian Order and the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek. In 1563 Hiiumaa was annexed into Sweden. In 1710, as a result of the Great Northern War the island went under the control of the Russian Empire. During World War I, the German military forces occupied Hiiumaa in 1917. In 1918–1940 Hiiumaa was part of the Republic of Estonia, then until 1991 occupied by the Soviet Union.

On demands of the Hanseatic League a lighthouse was built in Kõpu (previously known as &quot;Dagerort&quot;) at the beginning of the 16th century. It is considered the third-oldest continuously operating lighthouse in the world, still showing its light to of the sea.

The oldest surviving building in the county is Pühalepa church which the Teutonic Order began building as a fortress church in 1225. The vaulted stone church was completed in the 14th century, and construction of the tower began in 1770. After a 19th-century renovation, the crosses of the Order of Malta were painted on the wall of the nave, which is associated with the membership of the Ungern-Sternberg family in this order. In the post-war years, the church was used as a warehouse. In 1993, the building was consecrated as a church again.&lt;ref name=&quot;puhkuseestis.ee/kirik&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the farm architecture comes from the 19th century. Prominent examples include the Mihkli farming complex and Soera farm-museum with historical national artifacts, respectively.

== Education ==
There are six schools in the county, one upper secondary school and one vocational education institution in Suuremõisa.

== Municipalities ==

The county consists of one municipality after the administrative reform of 2017. Between 2013 and 2017 the county was subdivided into 4 municipalities ( – parishes). The only urban settlement Kärdla is part of Hiiumaa Parish since 2017.

Rural municipalities:
* Hiiumaa Parish (&quot;includes the town of Kärdla&quot;)

== Geography ==
The county includes the islands of Hiiumaa () and Kassari () and a number of surrounding islets. The highest point is Tornimägi hill (), the longest river is Luguse (), and the biggest lake is Tihu Suurjärv ().

In the landscapes there can be found pine forests, mixed spruce and deciduous forests, swampy thickets and juniper shrubs, coastal meadows and bogs. The most frequent tree is pine which makes about a half of forests. Pine is followed by birch, spruce and alder. In total, there are about 1,000 species of vascular plants, of which about 100 are under protection. The wildlife of Hiiumaa is remarkable. Out of 30 species of mammals, big game as elk, deer, fox, wild boar and lynx roam the island. There are about 250 species of birds on the island, 195 of them nesting.

Among the Estonian counties Hiiumaa is the richest in forest – nearly 60% of the island are wooded areas. There are large marsh areas in the middle of the island. The marshes cover about 7% of its area. Cultivated land and settlements take about 23% of the area of the county.

<doc id="395544" wikidata="Q93419" url="?curid=395544" title="Maurice Benyovszky">
<text>Count Maurice Benyovszky de Benyó et Urbanó (; ; ; 20 September 1746 – 24 May 1786) was a military officer, adventurer, and writer from the Kingdom of Hungary, who described himself as both a Hungarian and a Pole. He is considered a national hero in Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.

Benyovszky was born and raised in Verbó, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Vrbové, Slovakia). In 1769, while fighting for the Polish armies under the Bar Confederation, he was captured by the Russians and exiled to Kamchatka. He subsequently escaped and returned to Europe via Macau and Mauritius, arriving in France. In 1773, Benyovszky reached agreement with the French government to establish a trading post on Madagascar. Facing significant problems with the climate, the terrain, and the native Sakalava people, he abandoned the trading post in 1776.

Benyovszky then returned to Europe, joined the Austrian Army and fought in the War of the Bavarian Succession. After a failed venture in Fiume (present-day Rijeka), he travelled to America and obtained financial backing for a second voyage to Madagascar. The French governor of Mauritius sent a small armed force to close down his operation, and Benyovszky was killed in May 1786.

In 1790, Benyovszky&#x27;s posthumous and largely fictitious account of his adventures, entitled &quot;Memoirs and Travels of Mauritius Augustus Count de Benyowsky, Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Volume 2&quot; was published to great success.

==Biography==
Benyovszky&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;Memoirs&quot; of 1790 makes many claims about his life. Critics from 1790 onwards have shown that many of these are either false or are highly questionable. Not the least is Benyovszky&#x27;s opening statement that he was born in 1741, rather than 1746 – a birth-date which allowed him to claim having fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War with the rank of lieutenant and having studied navigation. The following biographical account includes only those facts which are (or could yet be) corroborated by other sources. It should also be noted here that, although Benyovszky freely used the titles &quot;Baron&quot; and &quot;Count&quot; for himself throughout his &quot;Memoirs&quot; and in correspondence up to 1776, he was never a &quot;Baron&quot; (his mother was the daughter of one) and he only became a &quot;Count&quot; in 1778.

===Early years===
Maurice Benyovszky was born on 20 September 1746 in the town of Verbó (present-day Vrbové near Trnava, Slovakia). He was baptised under the Latin names Mattheus Mauritius Michal Franciscus Seraphinus (Hungarian: &quot;Máté Móric Mihály Ferenc Szerafin&quot;). The additional name Augustus (&quot;Ágost&quot;) may also have been given, but this is not clear on his baptismal record.

Maurice was the son of Sámuel Benyovszky, who came from Turóc County in the Kingdom of Hungary (today partially Turiec region, in present-day Slovakia) and is said to have served as a colonel in the Hussars of the Austrian Army. His mother, Rozália Révay, was the daughter of a baron from the noble Hungarian Révay family; she was the great-granddaughter of Péter Révay, and the daughter of Count Boldizsár Révay de Szklabina. When she married Sámuel Benyovszky, she was the widow of an army general (Josef Pestvarmegyey, d.1743).

Maurice was the eldest of four children born to Sámuel and Rozália: he had one sister, Márta, and two brothers, Ferenc (1753–?) and Emánuel (1755–1799). Both brothers followed military careers. In addition, there were three step-sisters and one step-brother, born to Rozália from her previous marriage – Theresia (1735–1763), Anna (b. pre-1743), Borbála (b. 1740), and Peter (b. 1743).

Maurice spent his childhood in the Benyovszky mansion in Verbó and studied from 1759 to 1760 at the Piarist College in Szentgyörgy (present-day Svätý Jur), a suburb of Pressburg (present-day Bratislava). When both his parents died in 1760, the family home and estate was the subject of litigation between the two sets of siblings.

His mother tongue was Hungarian. Though no birth records have survived, his name in the records of the Szentgyörgy college appeared as a Hungarian nobleman, but for unknown reasons the following year&#x27;s data were re-written to Slovak with a different handwriting.

===Marriage and military service===

In 1765 Benyovszky occupied his mother&#x27;s property in Hrusó (present-day Hrušové) near Verbó, which had been legally inherited by one of his step-brothers-in-law. This action led his mother&#x27;s family to file a criminal complaint against him, and he was called to stand trial in Nyitra (present-day Nitra). Before the conclusion of the trial, Benyovszky fled to Poland to join his uncle, Jan Tibor Benyowski de Benyo, a Polish nobleman. His flight violated a legal edict forbidding him to leave the country. 

He was arrested in July 1768 in Szepesszombat (present-day Spišská Sobota), a suburb of Poprád (present-day Poprad) in the house of a German butcher named Hönsch for trying to organize a Confederation of Bar militia. Shortly after his arrest, Benyovszky was briefly imprisoned in the nearby Stará Ľubovňa castle. At around this time, he married the daughter of this butcher, Anna Zusanna Hönsch (1750–1826). A child, Samuel, was born to this marriage on 9 December 1768 (d. Poprad, 22 September 1772.)

Three other children later came from this marriage: Charles Maurice Louis Augustus (b.1774?, Madagascar?, d. 11 July 1774, Madagascar); Roza (b. 1 January 1779, Beczko, Hungary; d. 26 October 1816, Vieszka, Hungary); and Zsofia, (b. after 1779).

===Prisoner-of-war in Siberia===
This period of Benyovszky&#x27;s life has only been documented by Benyovszky himself, in his autobiographical &quot;Memoirs&quot;. There exists no independent verification of his life in the period between July 1768 and September 1770.

In July 1768, Benyovszky travelled to Poland to join the patriotic forces of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, who had organised resistance in the Confederation of Bar (Konfederacja Barska), a movement in rebellion against Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski, lately installed by Russia. In April 1769, he was captured by the Russian forces near Ternopil in Ukraine, imprisoned in the town of Polonne, before being transferred to Kiev in July, and finally to Kazan in September. An escape attempt from Kazan brought him to St Petersburg in November, where he was recaptured and sent to the far east of Siberia as a prisoner. In the company of several other exiles and prisoners – most notably the Swede August Winbladh, and the Russian army-officers Vasilii Panov, Asaf Baturin and Ippolit Stepanov, all of whom played a major role in Benyovszky&#x27;s life in the next two years – he reached Bolsheretsk, at that time the administrative capital of Kamchatka, in September 1770.

===Escape from Kamchatka===
Over the next few months, Benyovszky and Stepanov, along with other exiles and disaffected residents of Kamchatka, organised an escape. From the list of those who participated in the escape (70 men, women, and children), it is evident that the majority were not prisoners or exiles of any sort, but just ordinary working people of Kamchatka. At the start of May, an armed uprising by the group overcame the garrison of Bolsheretsk, during which the commander, Grigorii Nilov, was killed. The supply ship &quot;St Peter and St Paul&quot;, which had been overwintering in Kamchatka, was seized and loaded with furs and provisions. On 23 May (Old Style: 12 May), the ship set sail from the mouth of the Bolsha River, and headed southwards.

Benyovszky&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; state that the route taken by the ship, having rounded the southernmost point of Kamchatka, was generally north and eastwards, taking in Bering Island, the Bering Strait, Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands.   However, in the time available (four weeks according to Benyovszky&#x27;s own account), this 6000-mile itinerary is barely credible for a leaky ship and inexperienced crew. Such a route is completely absent from three other separate accounts of the voyage (by Ippolit Stepanov, Ivan Ryumin, and Gerasim Izmailov). Additionally, some of the events described by Benyovszky are so implausible that the entire voyage in this area must be considered a fiction.

The ship landed at the island of Simushir in the Kuril Islands chain, and stayed there between 29 May and 9 June to bake bread and take stock of their supplies and cargo. During this time, the sailor Izmailov who was judged to be organising a mutiny and two other Kamchatkans were left on the island when the ship finally sailed southwards. Izmailov subsequently carved out a career as an explorer and trader in the Aleutians and the Alaskan coast, providing information to Captain James Cook in the summer of 1778.

Their next known port of call was at Sakinohama on the island of Shikoku in Japan, where they rested between 19 and 23 July, and in the following days at Oshima island in Awa Province. Here the voyagers managed to trade with villagers, despite this being expressly forbidden by the Japanese authorities.

===Taiwan===
At the end of July, they landed on Amami-Oshima in the Ryükyü islands, where they also traded successfully. At the end of August they arrived on the island of Formosa (present-day Taiwan), probably at Black Rock Bay, where three of the voyagers were killed during a fight with native islanders.

According to a 1790 English translation of the &quot;Memoirs&quot;, an eighteen-person party landed on Taiwan&#x27;s eastern shores in 1771. They met a few people and asked them for food. They were taken to a village and fed rice, pork, lemons, and oranges. They were offered a few knives. While making their way back to the ship, they were hit by arrows. The party fired back and killed six attackers. Near their ship, they were ambushed again by 60 warriors. They defeated their attackers and captured five of them. Benyovszky wanted to leave but his associates insisted on staying. A larger landing party rowed ashore a day later and were met by 50 unarmed locals. The party headed to the village and slaughtered 200 locals while eleven of the party members were injured. They then left and headed north with the guidance of locals.

Upon reaching a &quot;beautiful harbor&quot; they met Don Hieronemo Pacheco, a Spaniard who had been living among the aborigines for seven to eight years. The locals were grateful toward Benyovszky for killing the villagers, who they considered their enemies. Pacheco told Benyovszky that the western side of the island was ruled by the Chinese but the rest was independent or inhabited by aborigines. Pacheco told Benyovszky that it would take very little to conquer the island and drive out the Chinese. On the third day, Benyovszky was calling the harbor &quot;Port Maurice&quot; after himself. Conflict broke out again as the party was fetching fresh water and three members were killed. The party executed their remaining prisoners and slaughtered a boatful of the enemies. By the end, they had killed 1,156 and captured 60 aborigines. They were visited by a prince named Huapo who believed Benyovszky was prophesied to free them from the &quot;Chinese yoke.&quot; With Benyovszky&#x27;s arms, Huapo then defeated his Chinese aligned foes. Huapo gifted Benyovszky&#x27;s crew with gold and other valuables to try to get them to stay but Benyovszky wanted to go so that he could see his wife and son.

There are reasons to suspect this account of events is either exaggerated or fabricated. Benyovszky&#x27;s exploits have been questioned by several experts over the years. Ian Inkster&#x27;s &quot;Orientat Enlightenment: The Problematic Military Claims of Count Maurice Auguste Conte de Benyowsky in Formosa during 1771&quot; criticizes the Taiwan section specifically. The population of Taiwan given by Benyovszky&#x27;s account is inconsistent with estimates of that time. The stretch of coast he visited likely only had 6,000 to 10,000 inhabitants but somehow the prince was able to gather 25,000 warriors to fight 12,000 enemies. Even in Father de Mailla&#x27;s account of Taiwan in 1715, in which he portrayed the Chinese in a very negative manner, and spoke of the entire east being in rebellion against the west, the aborigines were still unable to put up a fighting force of more than 30 or 40 armed with arrows and javelins. Huaco was also mentioned to have nearly 100 horsemen while having 68 to spare for the European party&#x27;s use. Horses were introduced to Taiwan starting in the Dutch period but it is highly unlikely that aborigines of the northeast coast had acquired so many that they could train them for large scale warfare. In other 18th century accounts, it was mentioned that horses were in such scarce supply that Chinese oxen were used as substitutes.

===Macao===
Then they sailed to the Chinese mainland, at Dongshan Island. Following the coast down from there, they finally arrived at Macao on 22 September 1771.

Shortly after their arrival in Macao, 15 of the voyagers died, most likely from the effects of malnutrition. Benyovszky took responsibility for selling the ship and all the furs they had loaded at Kamchatka, and then negotiated with the various European trading establishments for passage back to Europe. In late January 1772, two French ships took the survivors away from Macao. Some of them (13) stopped on the island of Mauritius, others died en route (8), and the remainder (26) landed at the French port of Lorient in July.

===First expedition to Madagascar===
Benyovszky managed to get a passport to enter the mainland of France and he departed almost immediately for Paris, leaving his companions behind. Over the next months, he toured the ministries and salons of Paris, hoping to persuade someone to fund a trading expedition to one of the several places he claimed to have visited. Eventually, he managed to convince the French Foreign Minister d&#x27;Aiguillon and the Navy Secretary de Boynes to fund an expedition of Benyovszky and a large group of &#x27;Benyovszky Volunteers&#x27;, to set up a French colony on Madagascar.

This expedition arrived in Madagascar in November 1773 and were fully established there by the end of March 1774. They set up a trading-post at Antongil on the east coast and began to negotiate with the islanders for cattle and other supplies. It does not appear to have gone well, since the explorer Kerguelen arrived there shortly afterwards to discover that the Malagasy claimed Benyovszky was at war with them: supplies were therefore hard to come by. A ship which called in at Antongil in July 1774 reported that 180 of the original 237 ordinary &#x27;Volunteers&#x27; had died, and 12 of their 22 officers, all taken by sickness. A year later, despite reinforcements, personnel numbers were still dwindling.

Benyovszky&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; state that a son (Charles) was born to him and his wife Anna at some point during 1773 or 1774, and that the son died of fever in July 1774, though this is not verified anywhere else.

Despite these setbacks, over the following two years, Benyovszky sent back to Paris positive reports of his advances in Madagascar, along with requests for more funding, supplies, and personnel. The French authorities and traders on Mauritius, meanwhile, were also writing to Paris, complaining of the problems which Benyovszky was causing for their own trade with Madagascar. In September 1776, Paris sent out two government inspectors to see what Benyovszky had achieved. Their report was damning – little remained of any of the roads, hospitals or trading-posts of which Benyovszky had boasted. Benyovszky&#x27;s own journal of events upon Madagascar suggests great successes against a recalcitrant people, who eventually proclaimed him to be their supreme chief and King (Ampansacabe); however, this sits at odds with his own reports (and those of the inspectors) of unceasing troubles and minor wars against those same people. In December 1776, just after the government inspectors had departed, Benyovszky left Madagascar. Following the arrival of the inspectors&#x27; report in Paris, the few surviving &#x27;Benyovszky Volunteers&#x27; were disbanded in May 1778 and the trading post was eventually dismantled by order of the French government in June 1779.

===Europe and America===
After leaving Madagascar, Benyovszky arrived back in France in April 1777. He managed to be granted a medal (Order of Saint Louis) and considerable amounts of money in back-pay, and lobbied the ministers for more money and resources for a different development plan for Madagascar. When this plan was turned down, he then petitioned Empress Maria Theresa of Austria for a pardon (for having fled Hungary for Poland in 1768) and made his way to Hungary where he received the title of &#x27;Count&#x27; (a title he had been misusing, along with &#x27;Baron&#x27;, for several years before). In July 1778 he joined the Austrian forces fighting in the War of the Bavarian Succession – in which his brother Emanuel was also fighting – and then in early 1780 he formed a plan to develop the port of Fiume (present-day Rijeka) as a major trading-port for Hungary. He was here until the end of 1781, when he abandoned the project, leaving behind several large debts. He then made his way to the United States and, with a recommendation from Benjamin Franklin, whom he had met in Paris, attempted to persuade George Washington to fund a militia under Benyovszky&#x27;s leadership, to fight in the American War of Independence. (His brother Ferenc was also at that time in America, fighting as a mercenary against the British). Washington remained unconvinced, and Benyovszky then returned to Europe, arriving in Britain in late 1783. Here he submitted a proposal to the British government for a colony on Madagascar, but was again turned down. Instead he managed to persuade the Royal Society of London luminary Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan to fund an independent expedition; in return, Magellan received full publishing rights over the manuscript of Benyovszky&#x27;s Memoirs, and the grand title of &#x27;European Plenipotentiary’ for Benyovszky&#x27;s new trading company. In September 1783, Benyovszky also acquired a document signed by Emperor Joseph II of Austria, which gave Benyovszky Austrian protection for the exploitation and government of Madagascar.

===Second expedition to Madagascar===
In April 1784, Benyovszky and several trading partners sailed to America, where a contract was agreed to with two Baltimore traders, Zollichofer and Meissonier. The deal was for monetary investment in return for a regular supply of slaves. In October of that year, the ship &quot;Intrepid&quot; sailed for Madagascar, arriving near Cap St Sebastien in north-west of the island, June 1785. Here the expedition was met with aggression from the Sakalava people; Benyovszky and a number of others were captured and disappeared, presumed dead. The surviving members of the company sailed for Mozambique, sold the ship and dispersed.

In January 1786, however, Benyovszky was reported to be alive and operating at Angonsty (near modern-day Ambohitralanana). Anxious about another disruption to trade, François de Souillac, the French governor of Mauritius waited for fair winds and then sent a small military force over to Madagascar to deal with Benyovszky. On 23 or 24 May 1786, Benyovszky was ambushed and killed by these troops, and was buried on the site of his encampment. (Most biographies cite 23 May based on the statement by Benyovszky&#x27;s 1790 editor William Nicholson, but French sources documented by Prosper Cultru cite 24 May.)

The Warsaw newspaper &quot;Gazeta Warszawska&quot;, in its edition of 1 December 1787, reported that the &quot;famous Hungarian Baron Beniowski, who was said so many times to have died&quot;, was at that time in Vienna, where he had come from Istanbul. However, since there is no further report of Benyovszky being alive, this report was most likely a false rumour or misunderstanding.

==Legacy==

Much of what Benyovszky claimed to have done in Poland, Kamchatka, Japan, Formosa, and Madagascar is questionable at best, but in any case has left no lasting traces in the history of war, exploration, or colonialism. His legacy resides largely in his autobiography (&quot;Memoirs and Travels of Mauritius Augustus Count de Benyowsky&quot;), which was published in two volumes in 1790 by friends of Magellan, who was by then, as a result of the failed Malagasy venture, in serious financial difficulties. Even at the time of the first publication of the book, it was met with significant scepticism by reviewers. Despite this criticism, it was a great publishing success, and has since been translated into several languages; (German 1790, 1791, 1796, 1797; Dutch 1791; French 1791; Swedish 1791; Polish 1797; Slovak 1808; and Hungarian 1888).

The Kamchatkan portion of &quot;Memoirs&quot; was adapted into a number of successful plays and operas (plays by Kotzebue 1792 and Vulpius 1794 and Operas by Boieldieu 1800 and Doppler 1847) which were performed in suitable translation all over Europe and America. The Polish national bard Juliusz Słowacki published a poem about him in 1841. More recently, films and television series have been made – a Czechoslovakian-Hungarian television series in 1975 (&quot;Vivát Benyovszky!&quot;, director: Igor Ciel), &quot;Die unfreiwilligen Reisen des Moritz August Benjowski“ (a television series in four episodes, director: Helmut Pigge, aired by the West German ZDF in 1975), a documentary for Hungarian TV in 2009 (&quot;Benyovszky Móric és a malgasok földje&quot;, director: Zsolt Cseke), and a Hungarian film &quot;Benyovszky, the Rebel Count &quot;of 2012 (director Irina Stanciulescu).

In Hungary, Slovakia and Poland he is still celebrated as a significant national hero. A Hungarian-Malagasy Friendship organisation promotes the links between Benyovszky and Madagascar, arranges conferences and other meetings, and maintains a website dedicated to the celebration of Benyovszky&#x27;s life. 
The Polish writer Arkady Fiedler visited Madagascar in 1937, spent several months in the town of Ambinanitelo and later wrote a popular travel book describing his experiences. In it, he gives a romanticised version of Benyovszky&#x27;s career. The Hungarian writer Miklós Rónaszegi also wrote a book about him in 1955, titled The Great Game (A Nagy Játszma).

Fiedler appears to have made an effort to find out if Benyovszky was still remembered by the island&#x27;s people – with mixed results. In fact his name did survive in Madagascar – in recent years, a street in the island capital Antananarivo was renamed &#x27;Lalana Benyowski&#x27;. Slovakians reportedly tore down his memorial in Madagascar built by Hungarians and replaced it with their own, aiming to Slovakize the character.

<doc id="395556" wikidata="Q1055394" url="?curid=395556" title="Kazusa Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of modern Chiba Prefecture. The province was located in the middle of the Bōsō Peninsula, whose name takes its first &quot;kanji&quot; from the name of Awa Province and its second from Kazusa and Shimōsa provinces. Its abbreviated form name was or . The borders of Kazusa Province were defined by Shimōsa Province to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the east, Awa Province to the south, and Tokyo Bay to the west.

Kazusa was classified as one of the provinces of the Tōkaidō. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Kazusa was ranked as a &quot;great country&quot; (大国) and a &quot;far country&quot; in relation to its distance from the capital (遠国). Along with Kōzuke and Hitachi, it was originally one of the provinces where an imperial prince was nominally assigned as governor.

==History==

===Early history===
Kazusa was originally part of a larger territory known as , which was divided into &quot;upper&quot; and “lower” portions (i.e. Kazusa and Shimōsa) during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku (645–654). It was well known to the Imperial Court in Nara -period Japan for its fertile lands, and is mentioned in Nara period records as having supplied hemp to the Court. Kazusa was divided into 15 counties, of which the four counties comprising the district of Awa were separated in 718 into a separate province. The exact location of the capital of Kazusa is not precisely known, but is believed to have been somewhere within the borders of the modern city of Ichihara, Chiba. The ruins of the &quot;kokubun-ji&quot;, or provincial temple, of Kazusa has been located in the Sōza district of Ichihara. The &quot;kokubun-ji&quot; was first excavated in 1949, and is on a plateau above the Yōrō River in close proximity to Tokyo Bay. The site is protected as a Designated Historic Site of Japan. However, the &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; of Kazusa Province is the Tamasaki Shrine in what is now the town of Ichinomiya, Chiba, on the opposite coast of the province.

During the Heian period, the province was divided into numerous &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by local samurai clans, primarily the Chiba clan, which sided with Minamoto no Yoritomo in the Genpei War. During the Kamakura period, much of the province was under the control of the Ashikaga clan. By the early Muromachi period, the area was a highly contested region highly fragmented by various samurai clans. However, by the Sengoku period, the Satomi clan had gained control over much of Awa, Kazusa and Shimōsa provinces.

The Satomi provided only lukewarm support to Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Battle of Odawara against the Later Hōjō clan and were subsequently deprived of their holdings in Kazusa and Shimōsa. After the installation of Tokugawa Ieyasu in Edo, Kazusa became part of the Tokugawa clan holdings, and Tokugawa hereditary retainer Honda Tadakatsu was promoted to &quot;daimyō&quot; of Ōtaki Domain (50,000 &quot;koku&quot;).

===Edo period===

During the Edo period, several small domains were created within the borders of Kazusa, most of which continued to be retained as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory owned directly by the &quot;shōgun&quot; and administered by various &quot;hatamoto&quot;. The entire province had an assessed revenue of 425,080 &quot;koku&quot;.

====Edo period Domains in Kazusa Province====
===Abolishment===
Following the Boshin War, Jōzai Domain was abolished for its opposition to the Meiji Restoration, and six minor domains were created for daimyō dispossessed with the creation of Sunpu Domain for the ex-&quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Yoshinobu. These various domains and &quot;tenryō&quot; territories were transformed into short-lived prefectures in July 1871 by the abolition of the han system, and the entire territory of Kazusa Province became part of the new Chiba Prefecture on June 15, 1873.

==Historical districts==
The area of former Kazusa Province was organized into nine districts by the Meiji period cadastral reforms, later reduced to five:
* Chiba Prefecture
** Amaha District (:ja:天羽郡) - merged with Mōda and Sue Districts to become Kimitsu District (:ja: 君津郡) on April 1, 1897
** Ichihara District (:ja:市原郡) - dissolved
** Isumi District (:ja: 夷隅郡)
** Kamihabu District (:ja:上埴生郡) - merged with Nagara District to become Chōsei District (:ja: 長生郡) on April 1, 1897
** Mōda District (:ja:望陀郡) - merged with Amaha and Sue Districts to become Kimitsu District on April 1, 1897
** Musha District (:ja:武射郡) - merged with Yamabe District to become Sanbu District (:ja: 山武郡) on April 1, 1897
** Nagara District (:ja:長柄郡) - merged with Kamihabu District to become Chōsei District on April 1, 1897
** Sue District (:ja:周淮郡) - merged with Amaha and Mōda Districts to become Kimitsu District on April 1, 1897
** Yamabe District (:ja:山辺郡) - merged with Musha District to become Sanbu District on April 1, 1897

<doc id="395557" wikidata="Q270415" url="?curid=395557" title="Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington">
<text>Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington (1673 – 2 July 1743) was a British Whig statesman who served continuously in government from 1715 until his death in 1743. He sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1698 and 1728, and was then raised to the peerage and sat in the House of Lords. He served as the prime minister of Great Britain from 1742 until his death in 1743. He is considered to have been Britain&#x27;s second prime minister, after Robert Walpole, but worked closely with the Secretary of State, Lord Carteret, in order to secure the support of the various factions making up the government.

== Early life and education ==
Spencer Compton was born in 1673 in Compton Wynyates, a Tudor castle in Warwickshire. He was the third son of James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton, who fought for the royalists during the English Civil War and his wife Mary Noel, daughter of Baptist Noel, 3rd Viscount Campden. His father died in 1681 when Spencer was young and his brother, George Compton, become the sole beneficiary of the family&#x27;s estates. Spencer was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School and matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 28 February 1690, aged 15; thereafter he was admitted into Middle Temple in 1687.

== Early political career ==
=== English House of Commons ===
Although his family were High Tories, Compton turned to the Whigs after a quarrel with his brother, the 4th Earl of Northampton. He first stood for Parliament at East Grinstead on the interest of his kinsman the Earl of Dorset at the 1695 English general election but was unsuccessful. He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Eye at a by-election on 3 June 1698. In Parliament he soon stood out as prominent amongst the Whigs and began a partnership with Robert Walpole that would last for over forty years. Compton was returned unopposed for Eye at the two general elections of 1701 and in 1702 and 1705.

=== Paymaster of Pensions ===
In 1707 Compton became Paymaster of Pensions, a post that he retained for the next six years. He was returned unopposed again at the 1708 British general election and was particularly active in Parliament thereafter. He remained as chairman of the committee of privileges and elections, and was a teller on the Whig side in many divisions. He managed several bills and on 14 December 1709 was nominated to the committee to draw up the articles of impeachment against Dr Sacheverell. At the 1710 British general election he was dropped as a candidate for Eye by his patron Lord Cornwallis after a disagreement, and he was unwilling to risk standing anywhere else because of his involvement with the Sacheverell case. However he retained his post as Paymaster of Pensions after the Tory government took office in that year. It is believed that the Tories retained him because they sought to maintain the support of the Compton family. At the 1713 British general election he was returned as Whig MP for East Grinstead and when the Whigs took power in 1715 he was hopeful that he would enter a high office.

=== Speaker of the Commons ===

Instead of the high political office he had hoped for, Compton received the Court appointment of Treasurer to the Prince of Wales (later George II); shortly afterwards, however, he was unanimously elected as Speaker of the House of Commons. He held this post from 1715 to 1727. In 1716, he was invested a Privy Counsellor. He maintained the role of Speaker despite the split in the Whigs in 1717, in which he joined the Walpole-Townshend alliance and found himself in opposition to the government of the day. He managed to maintain his position though until 1720, when the split ended.

Compton had a reputation for being a lax Speaker, once telling an MP who complained of being interrupted, &quot;No sir, you have a right to speak, but the House have a right to judge whether they will hear you.&quot; When Walpole became the leading minister of the day in 1721 there was speculation about his future should George I pass away and be succeeded by his son, who was more favourably inclined towards Compton than Walpole and declared that he would replace the latter with the former on accession. In order to avoid this, Walpole sought to keep Compton on the margins of government, though he was appointed as Paymaster of the Forces, a very lucrative post, from 1722 until 1730. In 1725, Compton entered Walpole&#x27;s government as Lord Privy Seal and was also created a Knight of the Bath.

== In Government ==
=== Accession of George II ===
In 1727, George II succeeded to the throne and sought to bring about the change in leadership he had promised. However, Compton was not perceived as a man of great ability. He was described by a contemporary as &quot;a plodding, heavy fellow, with great application but no talents&quot;. In particular he proved unable to compete with Walpole&#x27;s proposals for an allowance for the king. At a meeting between the three, Compton declared he was not up to the task of government. He maintained a hatred of Walpole for the humiliation. With this passed his last serious chance of holding real control over policy, and his influence sharply declined as a result.

=== House of Lords and Patriot Whigs ===

In order to remove him from the Commons, Walpole raised Compton to the peerage as Baron Wilmington, of Wilmington in the County of Sussex on 8 January 1728; two years later, on 14 May 1730, he was created Viscount Pevensey, of Pevensey in the County of Sussex and Earl of Wilmington and was appointed Lord President of the Council in December of that year. He became increasingly associated with the Patriot Whigs, those most critical of Walpole, but in Parliament generally stuck to the official line of the ministry. In 1730 he attempted to form a coalition between the Patriot Whigs and the Hanoverian Tories to bring down Walpole, but this failed and he continued in office. However, during the Excise Crisis of 1733, he failed to carry through a threat to resign, after being bought off with the promise to make him a Knight of the Garter, which he duly was. This further weakened any following he still commanded. He served as Lord President until 1742.

He was involved in the creation of the Foundling Hospital in 1739, which was an orphanage for abandoned children. This charity became the capital&#x27;s most popular way to prove one&#x27;s philanthropic credentials and had very distinguished Board members (including Wilmington).

== Prime Minister ==
In January 1742, he succeeded Walpole as First Lord of the Treasury and head of the Carteret ministry. Wilmington&#x27;s time in office was short and undistinguished and he was a poor leader. His opposition controlled the House of Commons so his direct influence was greatly limited. His brief premiership was dominated by dealing with foreign affairs, particularly in the War of the Austrian Succession. His strong work ethic took its toll, and his health gradually deteriorated. He remained in office until his death in 1743, when he was succeeded by the Paymaster of the Forces, Henry Pelham.

== Personal life ==

He bought the East Borne estate in Eastbourne, Sussex in 1724 and renamed it Compton Place. He engaged the architect Colen Campbell (and after Campbell&#x27;s death William Kent) to rebuild the house. It was completed in 1731.

He never married and died without issue, therefore all his titles became extinct upon his death. Over 1110 items from his &quot;large and valuable library&quot; were auctioned by Christopher Cock over 10 evenings, from to 27 February to 7 March 1733. He was buried at the family seat of Compton Wynyates in Warwickshire. Compton Place passed to his nephew, James Compton, 5th Earl of Northampton.

<text>Bowen is a coastal town and locality in the Whitsunday Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Bowen had a population of 11,205 people.

The locality contains two other towns:
* Heronvale ()
* Merinda ().

The Abbot Point coal shipping port is also within the locality ().

== Geography ==
Bowen is located on the north-east coast in North Queensland, at exactly twenty degrees south of the equator. Bowen is halfway between Townsville and Mackay, and by road from Brisbane.

Bowen sits on a square peninsula, with the Coral Sea to the north, east, and south. To the south-east is Port Denison and Edgecumbe Bay. On the western side, where the peninsula connects with the mainland, the Don River&#x27;s alluvial plain provides fertile soil that supports a prosperous farming industry.

Merinda is a hinterland town west of the town of Bowen.

The Bruce Highway enters the locality from the east, approaches but does not enter the town of Bowen itself, but then turns west to pass through Merinda before exiting the locality to the north-west. The North Coast railway line follows a similar route, approaching the district from the south and served by the Bowen railway station located to the west of the town. After exiting the station, the line turns northwest over the Don river to its next major stop at Home Hill. At Merinda railway station, there is the junction with the Collinsville-Newlands railway line servicing the Bowen basin Coalfields. The Collinsville-Newlands line extends to the coal-handling port at Abbot Point, also within the locality of Bowen. The railway station servicing the port is the Abbot Point railway station. 

Heronvale is a small coastal town by road south of the town of Bowen, accessed via the Bruce Highway and then Heronvale Road.

In the west of the locality is the Mount Aberdeen National Park.

Two of Bowen&#x27;s main streets are named after officers of the British colonial paramilitary Native Police force. Powell Street is named after Lieutenant Walter David Taylor Powell and Williams Street is named after Lieutenant Ewan G. Williams.

== History ==
Biri (also known as Birri) is a language of Central and North Queensland. Biri refers to a language chain extending from Central Queensland towards Townsville and is often used as a universal name for other languages and/or dialects across the region. The language area includes the towns of Bowen, Ayr, Collinsville and Nebo.

Yuru (also known as &quot;Juru, Euronbba, Juru, Mal Mal, Malmal&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuru country. The Yuru language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Shire of Burdekin, including the town of Home Hill.&quot;&quot;

Captain James Cook named Cape Gloucester on his voyage of exploration up the Australian coast in 1770. This &quot;cape&quot; turned out to be an island, and Gloucester Island dominates the view from Bowen&#x27;s eastern beaches. Behind the island is a bay that forms an excellent port, which the town came to be built around.

Shipwreck survivor, James Morrill, resided briefly in the area around the year 1850 with the local Aboriginal clan during his seventeen years living as a castaway.

In 1859 Captain Henry Daniel Sinclair led an expedition to the area in response to a reward offered by the colony of New South Wales for finding a port somewhere north of Rockhampton. They came across a &quot;most splendid harbour&quot; which Sinclair named Port Denison after the colonial governor of New South Wales, William Denison. On the shore they found &quot;several acres of ground resembling a garden...full of a vegetable resembling nuts&quot; which the local Aboriginal people had constructed.

On 11 September 1860, George Elphinstone Dalrymple on his naval excursion in the schooner &quot;Spitfire&quot; to search for the mouth of the Burdekin River, landed in Port Denison. He named and climbed Mount Gordon to survey the region and observed that a river (later named the Don River) traversed a valley just behind Port Denison and into the sea. This river was &quot;lined with camps and bush fires of the natives&quot; indicating &quot;the locality to be very thickly inhabited&quot;. The &quot;Spitfire&quot; continued its exploration north to Magnetic Island, but the surveyors came to the conclusion that the northeastern shore of Port Denison was the most suitable site in the region for settlement especially as the large native wells present in a creek bed there could be utilised as a water supply. On 5 October, Dalrymple again came ashore to appropriate control of these wells. He wrote that:


Confident in having secured a beach-head, Dalrymple explored the immediate vicinity near the wells that was to become the town of Bowen. He found a large Aboriginal tomb in the hills behind the beach that was in the form of a raised mound covered in bark with its surroundings swept clean and the paths leading to it closed off with branches. A similar tomb was found on nearby Stone Island. After a few days, Dalrymple and his surveying party on the &quot;Spitfire&quot; returned south.
In 1861, George Elphinstone Dalrymple set out again for the area, leading an overland expedition from Rockhampton, complemented with a naval contingent to rendezvous at Port Denison and establish a permanent settlement. Dalrymple planned this two pronged entry into the area because &#x27;a sudden cooperation of land and sea forces..would either strike terror, which would result in immediate flight, or enable a blow to be struck&#x27; against the local Aboriginal people of which many had been seen camped around the harbour. To facilitate this plan, Dalrymple travelled with Lieutenant Williams and six Native Police troopers, while Lieutenant Walter Powell and his troopers travelled on the ships. These ships were the &quot;Jeannie Dove&quot; and the &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; under the command of Capt. McDermott.

The maritime group arrived first and waited for Dalrymple&#x27;s overland party by camping on Stone Island at the mouth of the harbour. Dalrymple&#x27;s group, which included 140 horses and 121 cattle, arrived on 11 April 1861. He rode down to the area on the foreshore &#x27;beside the native wells&#x27; (which was to be the water supply of the settlement) in order &#x27;to clear off the aborigines from the same, should such be necessary&#x27; and to signal McDermott&#x27;s group on Stone Island. The local Aboriginal people had already fled. The settlers on Stone Island then came over to the site and the town of Port Denison was founded. Dalrymple wrote that it was &#x27;Deeply gratifying to me to see the British flag flying over the spot where..a few days ago, the wild aboriginal held undisputed sway&#x27;, and that the settlement marked &#x27;the advance of another great wave of Anglo-Australian energy&#x27;.

Within the first six weeks of colonisation, the Native Police and armed colonists conducted at least six operations against the Aboriginal people in the area, driving them off the land and also pursuing them by sea. In one of these missions, the whole available force in the town was utilised in an engagement where a large group of Aboriginal people were &quot;speedily put to rout with a loss sufficient to teach them a severe and it is hoped, useful lesson.&quot; Newspapers published reports that the local Aboriginal population were &quot;wretched caricatures of the human race...faithless stewards of the fine property on which they horde&quot;, and that it was &quot;the duty of civilisation to occupy the soil which they disregard and disgrace&quot;, and that &quot;force and even severity may be necessary to restrain their brutal disposition&quot;. Pastoralists were quick to enter the region through this new port and mark out land acquisitions in the hinterland, while buildings within the township were rapidly constructed.

After Queensland had separated from New South Wales, the town was renamed Bowen after the first Queensland colonial governor, Sir George Bowen. Port Denison Post Office opened in April 1861 and was renamed Bowen by 1865.

Between the 1860s and the 1880s, early colonists and settlers forecasted Bowen as the &quot;capital of a new North Queensland Colony&quot;. Relics of this particular ambition can be seen today in Bowen&#x27;s exacting road grid and town plan, and the avenue-like width of its central streets.

In 1863, settlers in the area encountered a sailor, James Morrill, who had been shipwrecked 17 years previously on a shoal in the Coral Sea. He had made it to the Queensland coast on a makeshift raft with a few companions. The others had all died within two years, but Morrill lived with the local Aborigines in the Townsville area. Rejoining European society after white settlement began in North Queensland, he settled in Bowen. His grave is in the Bowen cemetery.

Bowen State School opened in 1865. Between 1877 and 1922, it operated as two schools: Bowen Boys State School and Bowen Girls and Infants State School. A secondary department was added to Bowen State School in 1928. On 23 January 1961, the secondary department was replaced by Bowen State High School.

St Mary&#x27;s School was opened on 1 September 1872 by Sister M. Gertrude and Sister M. de Sales, both members of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart founded by Mother Mary MacKillop. Following to ongoing conflict between MacKillop and James Quinn, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, over who controlled the schools operated by the Sisters in Queensland, Quinn expelled the sisters from his diocese in 1880 and they returned to South Australia where the order was first established. Quinn established a group of Diocesan Sisters using the name Sisters of the Holy Family who operated the school under Quinn&#x27;s direct authority until 1885, when the Sisters of Mercy took over the running of the school withSister Mary Modwena Taylor, Sister M. Stanislaus Kostka Harding and Sister M. Winifred Duggan being transferred from The Range Convent School in Rockhampton.

The coral reefs around Bowen are the scene of several shipwrecks, including the SS Gothenburg, which sank in 1875 with a loss of more than 100 lives. Numerous relics of Bowen&#x27;s history, from the Aboriginal past onwards, are on display at the Bowen Historical Society&#x27;s museum.

On 22 February 1876, an F5 tornado hit the town, causing large amounts of damage.

The location of the Merinda railway station was influenced by the location of the Merinda meatworks (Bowen) for transportation of workers and distribution of meat products.

In 1894 the Bowen Meatworks operation was started but was often the subject of industrial disputes, changes in management and closures. In 1922, the Meatworks was able to process 150 bullocks per day It was a major source of industry and employment until 1997. 

Warden Bend Provisional School opened circa 1891. On 1 January 1909 it became Warden Bend State School. It closed in 1912.

Merinda Provisional School opened in 1898 and became Merinda State School on 1 January 1909.

On Sunday 30 April 1911, the foundation stone was laid for St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church. On Sunday 2 December 1912, the church was officially opened by James Murray, the Vicar Apostolic of Cooktown. 

On 24 February 2006, Bishop Michael Putney dedicated the current St Mary&#x27;s in Sinclair Street.

Roseville State School opened on 7 July 1913. It was along the Bowen-to-Proserpine tramway. The school closed on 1939.

Don Delta State School opened on 21 July 1913 and closed in 1964.

Eden Lassie Provisional School opened on 16 October 1916. In 1924 it became Eden Lassie State School. It closed in 1951, but later reopened and closed permanently in 1963. Opened as a provisional school in 1916 and was proclaimed a state school in 1924. It closed in 1951 and reopened before finally closing in 1963.

Twenty-five Mile Camp Provisional School opened on circa 1919. It may have been renamed Aberdeen Provisional School. In 1920 it was renamed Bogie Range Provisional School. It closed circa 1922.

Ballast Pit Provisional School opened on 11 April 1922. On 26 July 1923 it was renamed Bin Bee Provisional School. It closed in July 1927. It was on the Bowen Coalfields railway line.

Inverdon Road State School opened on 4 December 1922 and closed on 2 September 1955. It was at 174 Inverdon Road ().

Queens Beach State School opened on 25 November 1940.
Elements of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) have been operating from Bowen for almost two decades, beginning in the late 1920s. Three RAAF flying boat squadrons and one flying boat maintenance unit operated from the shores of Port Denison during World War 2 operating PBY Catalina and Martin Mariner amphibious seaplanes. No.55 (RAAF) Radar Station also operated from Cape Edgecumbe north-east of the town. The concrete seaplane aprons and ramps are still present.

In 1944, Bowen elected a Communist, Fred Paterson, to Queensland Legislative Assembly. He was re-elected in 1947, but lost the seat in 1950 when the boundaries were changed to include Bowen in the seat of Whitsunday.

Bowen State High School opened on 23 January 1961, replacing the secondary department at Bowen State School which had operated since 1 July 1928.

Bowen was the administrative centre for the Shire of Bowen. On 15 March 2008, under the &quot;Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007&quot; passed by the Parliament of Queensland on 10 August 2007, the Shire of Bowen merged with the Shire of Whitsunday to form the Whitsunday Region. Although Proserpine is the administrative centre for the new regional council, the council maintains offices in Bowen and holds a number of council meetings in Bowen each year.

== Heritage listings ==
Bowen has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Flemington Road: Flemington Road Cemetery
* 6 Herbert Street: Bowen Harbour Board Building
* 46 Herbert Street: Bowen Post Office
* 29 Kennedy Street: Bowen State School
* 30 Williams Street: Bowen Courthouse

== Economy ==
The town enjoys a diversified economy primarily based on agriculture, fishing, tourism, and mining. Its dry climate plus its fertile alluvial soil, makes it an ideal place to grow a wide variety of small crops, including tomatoes, rockmelons (i.e., cantaloupes), and capsicums (i.e., bell peppers).

<doc id="395564" wikidata="Q15279749" url="?curid=395564" title="Tax noncompliance">
<text>Tax noncompliance is a range of activities that are unfavorable to a government&#x27;s tax system. This may include tax avoidance, which is tax reduction by legal means, and tax evasion which is the illegal non-payment of tax liabilities. The use of the term &quot;noncompliance&quot; is used differently by different authors. Its most general use describes non-compliant behaviors with respect to different institutional rules resulting in what Edgar L. Feige calls unobserved economies. Non-compliance with fiscal rules of taxation gives rise to unreported income and a tax gap that Feige estimates to be in the neighborhood of $500 billion annually for the United States.

In the United States, the use of the term &#x27;noncompliance&#x27; often refers only to illegal misreporting. Laws known as a General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) statutes which prohibit &quot;tax aggressive&quot; avoidance have been passed in several developed countries including the United States (since 2010), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Norway and Hong Kong. In addition, judicial doctrines have accomplished the similar purpose, notably in the United States through the &quot;business purpose&quot; and &quot;economic substance&quot; doctrines established in &quot;Gregory v. Helvering&quot;. Though the specifics may vary according to jurisdiction, these rules invalidate tax avoidance which is technically legal but not for a business purpose or in violation of the spirit of the tax code. Related terms for tax avoidance include tax planning and tax sheltering.

Individuals that do not comply with tax payment include tax protesters and tax resisters. Tax protesters attempt to evade the payment of taxes using alternative interpretations of the tax law, while tax resisters refuse to pay a tax for conscientious reasons. In the United States, tax protesters believe that taxation under the Federal Reserve is unconstitutional, while tax resisters are more concerned with not paying for particular government policies that they oppose. Because taxation is often perceived as onerous, governments have struggled with tax noncompliance since the earliest of times.

==Differences between avoidance and evasion==
The use of the terms tax avoidance and tax evasion can vary depending on the jurisdiction. In general, &quot;evasion&quot; applies to illegal actions and &quot;avoidance&quot; to actions within the law. The term &quot;mitigation&quot; is also used in some jurisdictions to further distinguish actions within the original purpose of the relevant provision from those actions that are within the letter of the law, but do not achieve its purpose. All pursue the same immediate goal, minimising the amount paid.

In particular, in the American legal system, tax evasion is a criminal action disciplined by 26 US Code §7201, under which the taxpayer who fails to pay or willfully underpays his tax liability (i.e., with criminal mens rea like stated in the &quot;James v. United States&quot;) will undergo criminal penalties. On the other side of the coin, tax avoidance happens when the taxpayer tries to lessen his tax obligation using deductions and credits to maximize after-tax income. All of this is considered legal by the IRS even though it foresees civil penalties. All things considered, the main difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance is the taxpayer&#x27;s guilty mind of minimization or failure to pay the tax liability.

==Tax gap==
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service provides formal definitions: &quot;The &quot;gross tax gap&quot; is the difference between true tax liability for a given tax year and the amount that is paid on time. It is the &quot;nonfiling gap,&quot; the &quot;underreporting gap,&quot; and the &quot;underpayment (or remittance) gap.&quot; The &quot;net tax gap&quot; is the portion of the gross tax gap that will never be recovered through enforcement or other late payments.&quot;

=== Underground economy and tax gap ===
An important way to study the tax gap is to examine the size of the tax gap in a country by analyzing the size of the underground economy and its influencing factors. The size of the underground economy is directly related to the institutional infrastructure. The institutional infrastructure of a country mainly includes the intensity of government regulation, the establishment and implementation of laws, the degree of judicial independence, the size of effective tax rates, the effective provision of public goods or services, and the effective protection of property rights. It is generally believed that the higher the level of government regulation, the greater the size of its underground economy and the greater the tax gap. And vice versa, when government over-regulation occurs, an alternative relationship exists between the size of the underground economy and the size of the official economy. Representatives of this view are Levenson, Maloney, and Johnson. They believe that higher tax rates can raise higher tax revenues, and the government can provide higher levels of public services accordingly, thereby attracting more companies and individuals out of the underground economy, resulting in a healthy balance of &quot;high tax rates, high taxes, high public services, and small-scale underground economy&quot;, but low-tax countries, because they do not have enough income to provide high levels of public services, will form a vicious balance of &quot;low tax rates, low taxes, low public services, and high-scale underground economy.&quot; In the above-mentioned healthy balance, the tax gap is relatively small; in the vicious equilibrium, the tax gap is relatively large.

=== Tax customs and tax gaps ===
Tax custom is different from tax avoidance or tax evasion. It does not measure the taxation behavior of individuals, but the tax attitude of individuals. The tax custom can also be considered as the moral responsibility of the individual. Making a specific contribution to society by paying taxes on the government must fulfill this responsibility. It embodies the ethical code of conduct for individuals in taxation, although it does not require the form of law. The decline or deterioration of taxation practices will reduce the moral costs of taxpayers engaging in illegal operations or underground economic activities.

An empirical study by ALM on transition countries such as Russia found that there is a strong negative relationship between tax customary variables and underground economic size variables (which represent tax evasion or tax gaps) (correlation coefficient is -0.657). And both variables are significant at the 1% level.

Bird believed that a sustainable and efficient tax system must be based on perceived fairness and goodwill response to taxation. It must be connected organically with the provision of public goods or services. If taxpayers see their preferences reflected in governance and see efficient provision of government services, they stay in the official economy and fulfill tax obligations. Tax revenues increase while the tax gap narrows.

The economic experiments cited by Torgler and Schaltegger show that the extensive exercise of voting rights in tax affairs will significantly increase taxpayer compliance. The deeper the taxpayer participates in political decision making, the higher the tax contract performance efficiency and tax compliance. The taxpayer society in this state is a civil society with tax and good customs, and the taxpayer is a real citizen who has been given a wide range of powers.

Everest Phillips believes that the design of a reasonable and effective tax system is an important part of the construction in a country. The operation of this tax system must be based on the higher compliance of taxpayers and the goodness of taxation rather than relying on coercive measures. He pointed out that as the country&#x27;s tax system for building important content must have the following five important characteristics: 
# Political participation. The wide participation of taxpayers in the political decision-making process is an important guarantee for establishing social taxation and good customs. When taxpayers lack effective access to decision-making, they will be concerned about tax revenue collection and the lack of efficiency in the provision of public goods or services. Tax compliance will be reduced, and taxation practices are likely to deteriorate. As a result, tax evasion scale will expand and tax gaps will increase. This situation will further weaken the ability of government to provide public goods or services, and thus trap the construction process into a vicious cycle. 
# Responsibility and transparency. The government should have a legitimate duty to use tax revenues, and procedures for providing public goods or services should be transparent to taxpayers. 
# Perceivable fairness. In a reasonable and effective tax system, taxpayers can perceive themselves as being treated equally and justly. With regard to tax incentives or tax exemptions, if taxpayers perceive that they are being treated unfairly, their tax willingness will inevitably decline. 
# Effectiveness. The government should have the ability to transform gradually increasing tax revenues into higher levels of public goods or services and enhance political stability. 
# Sharing a prosperous political commitment. The national taxation system should be closely linked with the national goal of promoting economic growth. Promoting economic growth is one of the strategic goals that the government has promised to taxpayers. The government can promote the realization of this strategic goal through taxation.

=== Tax collection management efficiency and tax gap ===

Under the premise of economic development level, the ability of a country to raise tax revenue is mainly determined by the tax system design in the country and the efficiency of its collection and management. From the perspective of taxation practices in various countries, the design of taxation system is affected and restricted by the efficiency of tax collection and management. Therefore, it can be said that the relative size of a country&#x27;s tax revenue collection and tax gap is closely related to the tax collection and management efficiency of the s tax administration agencies in the country.

A reasonable explanation for the introduction of value-added tax by most developing countries in the world is to increase the taxpayer&#x27;s compliance with tax payment through the mutual supervision mechanism between taxpayers without increasing the cost imposed by the tax administration authorities. This consideration for the factors of taxation determines that developing countries can only adopt the tax system that is mainly based on turnover tax. From the perspective of taxation, due to restrictions on the level of taxation in developing countries, tax revenues can only be raised through indirect taxes that focus on taxes such as value-added tax and consumption tax, while direct taxes represented by income taxes and property taxes are included in total tax revenue. The proportion is relatively low. Bird and Zolt pointed out that, contrary to the practice of taxation in developed countries, personal income tax still plays a very limited role in developing countries today, both in terms of income mobilization and adjustment of income disparities. In 2000, the income tax income of developed countries was 53.8% of total income, compared with 28.3% in developing countries. They believe that wages and other income of workers in the informal sector in developing countries are still free from tax collection. The same is true of the property tax situation. Due to the lack of necessary information and assessment mechanisms for the assessment of property values, property taxes cannot be successfully implemented in many developing countries; even if developing countries with property taxes exist, their income collection is still insufficient. From the above analysis, we can see that compared with indirect taxes, developing countries still have a large tax gap in terms of direct taxes.

==== Tax protesters and tax resisters ====
Some tax evaders believe that they have uncovered new interpretations of the law that show that they are not subject to being taxed (not liable): these individuals and groups are sometimes called tax protesters. Many protesters continue posing the same arguments that the federal courts have rejected time and time again, ruling the arguments to be legally frivolous.

Tax resistance is the refusal to pay a tax for conscientious reasons (because the resister finds the government or its actions morally reprehensible). They typically do not find it relevant whether that the tax laws are themselves legal or illegal or whether they apply to them, and they are more concerned with not paying for what they find to be grossly immoral, such as the bombing of innocents.

==United States==
In the United States &quot;tax evasion&quot; is evading the assessment or payment of a tax that is &quot;already legally owed at the time of the criminal conduct&quot;. Tax evasion is criminal, and has no effect on the amount of tax actually owed, although it may give rise to substantial monetary penalties.

By contrast, the term &quot;tax avoidance&quot; describes lawful conduct, the purpose of which is to &quot;avoid the creation of a tax liability&quot; in the first place. Whereas an evaded tax remains a tax legally owed, an avoided tax is a tax liability that has never existed.

For example, consider two businesses, each of which have a particular asset (in this case, a piece of real estate) that is worth far more than its purchase price.

* Business One (or an individual) sells the property and underreports its gain. In this instance, tax is legally due. Business One has engaged in tax evasion, which is criminal.
* Business Two (or an individual) consults with a tax advisor and discovers that the business can structure a sale as a &quot;like-kind exchange&quot; (formally known as a 1031 exchange, named after the Code section) for other real estate that the business can use. In this instance, no tax is due of the provisions of section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. Business Two has engaged in tax avoidance (or tax mitigation), which is completely within the law.

In the above example, tax may or may not eventually be due when the second property is sold. Whether and how much tax will be due will depend on circumstances and the state of the law at the time.

===Definition of tax evasion in the United States===

The application of the U.S. tax evasion statute may be illustrated in brief as follows. The statute is Internal Revenue Code section 7201:

Under this statute and related case law, the prosecution must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, each of the following three elements:

# the &quot;attendant circumstance&quot; of the existence of a tax deficiency – an unpaid tax liability; and
# the &quot;actus reus&quot; (i.e., guilty conduct) – an affirmative act (and not merely an omission or failure to act) in any manner constituting evasion or an attempt to evade either:
## the assessment of a tax, or
## the payment of a tax.
# the &quot;mens rea&quot; or &quot;mental&quot; element of willfulness – the specific intent to violate an actually known legal duty.

An affirmative act &quot;in any manner&quot; is sufficient to satisfy the third element of the offense. That is, an act which would otherwise be perfectly legal (such as moving funds from one bank account to another) could be grounds for a tax evasion conviction (possibly an attempt to evade &quot;payment&quot;), provided the other two elements are also met. Intentionally filing a false tax return (a separate crime in itself) could constitute an attempt to evade the &quot;assessment&quot; of the tax, as the Internal Revenue Service bases its initial assessment (i.e., the formal recordation of the tax on the books of the U.S. Treasury) on the tax amount shown on the return.

===Application to tax protesters===
The federal tax evasion statute is an example of an exception to the general rule under U.S. law that &quot;ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution&quot;. Under the &quot;Cheek&quot; Doctrine (&quot;Cheek v. United States&quot;), the United States Supreme Court ruled that a genuine, good faith belief that one is not violating the federal tax law (such as a mistake based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law itself) would be a valid defense to a charge of &quot;willfulness&quot; (&quot;willfulness&quot; in this case being knowledge or awareness that one is violating the tax law itself), even though that belief is irrational or unreasonable. On the surface, this rule might appear to be of some comfort to tax protesters who assert, for example, that &quot;wages are not income.&quot;

However, merely asserting that one has such a good faith belief is not determinative in court; under the American legal system the trier of fact (the jury, or the trial judge in a non-jury trial) decides whether the defendant really has the good faith belief he or she claims. With respect to willfulness, the placing of the burden of proof on the prosecution is of limited utility to a defendant that the jury simply does not believe.

A further stumbling block for tax protesters is found in the &quot;Cheek&quot; Doctrine with respect to arguments about &quot;constitutionality.&quot; Under the Doctrine, the belief that the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified and the belief that the federal income tax is otherwise unconstitutional are not treated as beliefs that one is not violating the &quot;tax law&quot; – i.e., these errors are not treated as being caused by the &quot;complexity of the tax law.&quot;

In the &quot;Cheek&quot; case the Court stated:

The Court continued:

The Court ruled that such beliefs – even if held in good faith – are not a defense to a charge of willfulness. By pointing out that arguments about constitutionality of federal income tax laws &quot;reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion, however wrong, that those provisions are invalid and unenforceable&quot;, the Supreme Court may have been impliedly warning that asserting such &quot;constitutional&quot; arguments (in open court or otherwise) might actually help the prosecutor prove willfulness. Daniel B. Evans, a tax lawyer who has written about tax protester arguments, has stated that

By contrast, under Canadian law, the honesty of a taxpayer in expressing his beliefs can be a mitigating factor in sentencing. In &quot;R. v. Klundert&quot;, 2011 ONCA 646, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a tax protestor&#x27;s conviction, but allowed him to serve a conditional sentence in the community on the grounds that his behaviour was neither fraudulent nor deceitful. The one-year custodial sentence imposed by the trial judge was overturned on this basis:

===Failing to file returns in the United States===
According to some estimates, about three percent of American taxpayers do not file tax returns at all. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, civil penalties for willful failure to timely file returns and willful failure to timely pay taxes are based on the amount of tax due; thus, if no tax is owed, no penalties are due. The civil penalty for willful failure to timely file a return is generally equal to 5.0% of the amount of tax &quot;required to be shown on the return per month, up to a maximum of 25%.

In cases where a taxpayer does not have enough money to pay the entire tax bill, the IRS can work out a payment plan with taxpayers, or enter into a collection alternative such as a partial payment Installment Agreement, an Offer in Compromise, placement into hardship or &quot;currently non-collectable&quot; status or file bankruptcy.

For years for which no return has been filed, there is no statute of limitations on civil actions – that is, on how long the IRS can seek taxpayers and demand payment of taxes owed.

For each year a taxpayer willfully fails to timely file an income tax return, the taxpayer can be sentenced to one year in prison. In general, there is a six-year statute of limitations on federal tax crimes.

The IRS has run several Overseas Voluntary Disclosure Programs in 2009 and 2011, and its current one has &quot;no set deadline for taxpayers to apply. However, the terms of this program could change at any time going forward.&quot;.

By contrast, the civil penalty for failure to timely pay the tax actually &quot;shown on the return&quot; is generally equal to 0.5% of such tax due per month, up to a maximum of 25%. The two penalties are computed together in a relatively complex algorithm, and computing the actual penalties due is somewhat challenging.

==United Kingdom==

The United Kingdom and jurisdictions following the UK approach (such as New Zealand) have recently adopted the evasion/avoidance terminology as used in the United States: evasion is a criminal attempt to avoid paying tax owed while avoidance is an attempt to use the law to reduce taxes owed. There is, however, a further distinction drawn between tax avoidance and tax mitigation. Tax avoidance is a course of action designed to conflict with or defeat the evident intention of Parliament: &quot;IRC v Willoughby&quot;.

Tax mitigation is conduct which reduces tax liabilities without &quot;tax avoidance&quot; (not contrary to the intention of Parliament), for instance, by gifts to charity or investments in certain assets which qualify for tax relief. This is important for tax provisions which apply in cases of &quot;avoidance&quot;: they are held not to apply in cases of mitigation.

The clear articulation of the concept of an avoidance/mitigation distinction goes back only to the 1970s. The concept originated from economists, not lawyers. The use of the terminology avoidance/mitigation to express this distinction was an innovation in 1986: &quot;IRC v Challenge&quot;.

In practice, the distinction is sometimes clear, but often difficult to draw. Relevant factors to decide whether conduct is avoidance or mitigation include: whether there is a specific tax regime applicable; whether transactions have economic consequences; confidentiality; tax linked fees. Important indicia are familiarity and use. Once a tax avoidance arrangement becomes common, it is almost always stopped by legislation within a few years. If something commonly done is contrary to the intention of Parliament, it is only to be expected that Parliament will stop it.

So that which is commonly done and not stopped is not likely to be contrary to the intention of Parliament. It follows that tax reduction arrangements which have been carried on for a long time are unlikely to constitute tax avoidance. Judges have a strong intuitive sense that that which everyone does, and has long done, should not be stigmatised with the pejorative term of &quot;avoidance&quot;. Thus UK courts refused to regard sales and repurchases (known as bed-and-breakfast transactions) or back-to-back loans as tax avoidance.

Other approaches in distinguishing tax avoidance and tax mitigation are to seek to identify &quot;the spirit of the statute&quot; or &quot;misusing&quot; a provision. But this is the same as the &quot;evident intention of Parliament&quot; properly understood. Another approach is to seek to identify &quot;artificial&quot; transactions. However, a transaction is not well described as &quot;artificial&quot; if it has valid legal consequences, unless some standard can be set up to establish what is &quot;natural&quot; for the same purpose. Such standards are not readily discernible. The same objection applies to the term &quot;device&quot;.

It may be that a concept of &quot;tax avoidance&quot; based on what is contrary to &quot;the intention of Parliament&quot; is not coherent. The object of construction of any statute is expressed as finding &quot;the intention of Parliament&quot;. In any successful tax avoidance scheme, a Court must have concluded that the intention of Parliament was not to impose a tax charge in the circumstances which the tax avoiders had placed themselves. The answer is that the expression &quot;intention of Parliament&quot; is being used in two senses.

It is perfectly consistent to say that a tax avoidance scheme escapes tax (there being no provision to impose a tax charge) and yet constitutes the avoidance of tax. One is seeking the intention of Parliament at a higher, more generalised level. A statute may fail to impose a tax charge, leaving a gap that a court cannot fill even by purposive construction, but nevertheless one can conclude that there would have been a tax charge had the point been considered. An example is the notorious UK case &quot;Ayrshire Employers Mutual Insurance Association v IRC&quot;, where the House of Lords held that Parliament had &quot;missed fire&quot;. 

===History of avoidance/evasion distinction===
An avoidance/evasion distinction along the lines of the present distinction has long been recognised but at first there was no terminology to express it. In 1860 Turner LJ suggested evasion/contravention (where evasion stood for the lawful side of the divide): &quot;Fisher v Brierly&quot;. In 1900 the distinction was noted as two meanings of the word &quot;evade&quot;: &quot;Bullivant v AG&quot;. The technical use of the words avoidance/evasion in the modern sense originated in the US where it was well established by the 1920s. It can be traced to Oliver Wendell Holmes in &quot;Bullen v. Wisconsin&quot;.

It was slow to be accepted in the United Kingdom. By the 1950s, knowledgeable and careful writers in the UK had come to distinguish the term &quot;tax evasion&quot; from &quot;avoidance&quot;. However, in the UK at least, &quot;evasion&quot; was regularly used (by modern standards, misused) in the sense of avoidance, in law reports and elsewhere, at least up to the 1970s. Now that the terminology has received official approval in the UK (&quot;Craven v White&quot;) this usage should be regarded as erroneous. But even now it is often helpful to use the expressions &quot;legal avoidance&quot; and &quot;illegal evasion&quot;, to make the meaning clearer.

===UK tax gap===

The UK &quot;tax gap&quot; is the difference between the amount of tax that should, in theory, be collected by the tax collection agency HMRC, against what is actually collected. The tax gap for the UK in 2018/19 was £31 billion, or 4.7% of total tax liabilities.

===UK tax resistors===
In the UK case of &quot;Cheney v. Conn&quot;, an individual objected to paying tax that, in part, would be used to procure nuclear arms in unlawful contravention, he contended, of the Geneva Convention. His claim was dismissed, the judge ruling that &quot;What the [taxation] statute itself enacts cannot be unlawful, because what the statute says and provides is itself the law, and the highest form of law that is known to this country.&quot;

==France==
France can be considered as having an average level of the European fiscal evasion (in terms of percentage of GDP) but in the upper ranks of the absolute level due to its high GDP. Indeed, the state budget is slashed by more than 160 billion euros every year (80 billion is slashed due to fiscal evasion and another 80 billion due to the abuse of social protection). The fiscal evasion is equivalent to 3% of the French GDP and the social protection is another 3%. In total, the French government is slashed of 6% of the country&#x27;s GDP.

==Europe==
Richard Murphy, a professor in Public Policy at City, University of London, produced the following estimates of the tax gap in different European countries.

<doc id="395569" wikidata="Q215865" url="?curid=395569" title="Nacre">
<text>Nacre ( , ), also known as mother-of-pearl, is an organicinorganic composite material produced by some molluscs as an inner shell layer. It is also the material of which pearls are composed. It is strong, resilient, and iridescent.

Nacre is found in some of the most ancient lineages of bivalves, gastropods, and cephalopods. However, the inner layer in the great majority of mollusc shells is porcellaneous, not nacreous, and this usually results in a non-iridescent shine, or more rarely in non-nacreous iridescence such as &quot;flame structure&quot; as is found in conch pearls.

The outer layer of cultured pearls and the inside layer of pearl oyster and freshwater pearl mussel shells are made of nacre. Other mollusc families that have a nacreous inner shell layer include marine gastropods such as the Haliotidae, the Trochidae and the Turbinidae.

==Physical characteristics==

=== Structure and appearance===

Nacre is composed of hexagonal platelets, called tablets, of aragonite (a form of calcium carbonate) 10–20 μm wide and 0.5 μm thick arranged in a continuous parallel . Depending on the species, the shape of the tablets differs; in &quot;Pinna&quot;, the tablets are rectangular, with symmetric sectors more or less soluble. Whatever the shape of the tablets, the smallest units they contain are irregular rounded granules. These layers are separated by sheets of organic matrix (interfaces) composed of elastic biopolymers (such as chitin, lustrin and silk-like proteins).

Nacre appears iridescent because the thickness of the aragonite platelets is close to the wavelength of visible light. These structures interfere constructively and destructively with different wavelengths of light at different viewing angles, creating structural colours.

The crystallographic &quot;c-&quot;axis points approximately perpendicular to the shell wall, but the direction of the other axes varies between groups. Adjacent tablets have been shown to have dramatically different c-axis orientation, generally randomly oriented within ~20° of vertical. In bivalves and cephalopods, the &quot;b-&quot;axis points in the direction of shell growth, whereas in the monoplacophora it is the &quot;a&quot;-axis that is inclined this way.

=== Mechanical properties ===
This mixture of brittle platelets and the thin layers of elastic biopolymers makes the material strong and resilient, with a Young&#x27;s modulus of 70 GPa and a yield stress of roughly 70 MPa (when dry). Strength and resilience are also likely to be due to adhesion by the &quot;brickwork&quot; arrangement of the platelets, which inhibits transverse crack propagation. This structure, spanning multiple length sizes, greatly increases its toughness, making it almost as strong as silicon. The mineral–organic interface results in enhanced resilience and strength of the organic interlayers. The interlocking of bricks of nacre has large impact on both the deformation mechanism as well as its toughness. Tensile, shear, and compression tests, Weibull analysis, nanoindentation, and other techniques have all been used to probe the mechanical properties of nacre. Theoretical and computational methods have also been developed to explain the experimental observations of nacre&#x27;s mechanical behavior. Nacre is stronger under compressive loads than tensile ones when the force is applied parallel or perpendicular to the platelets. As an oriented structure, nacre is highly anisotropic and as such, its mechanical properties are also dependent on the direction.

A variety of toughening mechanisms are responsible for nacre&#x27;s mechanical behavior. The adhesive force needed to separate the proteinaceous and the aragonite phases is high, indicating that there are molecular interactions between the components. In laminated structures with hard and soft layers, a model system that can be applied to understand nacre, the fracture energy and fracture strength are both larger than those values characteristic of the hard material only. Specifically, this structure facilitates crack deflection, since it is easier for the crack to continue into the viscoelastic and compliant organic matrix than going straight into another aragonite platelet. This results in the ductile protein phase deforming such that the crack changes directions and avoids the brittle ceramic phase. Based on experiments done on nacre-like synthetic materials, it is hypothesized that the compliant matrix needs to have a larger fracture energy than the elastic energy at fracture of the hard phase. Fiber pull-out, which occurs in other ceramic composite materials, contributes to this phenomenon. Unlike in traditional synthetic composites, the aragonite in nacre forms bridges between individual tablets, so the structure is not only held together by the strong adhesion of the ceramic phase to the organic one, but also by these connecting nanoscale features. As plastic deformation starts, the mineral bridges may break, creating small asperities that roughen the aragonite-protein interface. The additional friction generated by the asperities helps the material withstand shear stresses. In nacre-like composites, the mineral bridges have also been shown to increase the flexural strength of the material because they can transfer stress in the material. Developing synthetic composites that exhibit similar mechanical properties as nacre is of interest to scientists working on developing stronger materials. To achieve these effects, researchers take inspiration from nacre and use synthetic ceramics and polymers to mimic the &quot;brick-and-mortar&quot; structure, mineral bridges, and other hierarchical features.

When dehydrated, nacre loses much of its strength and acts as a brittle material, like pure aragonite. The hardness of this material is also negatively impacted by dehydration. Water acts as a plasticizer for the organic matrix, improving its toughness and reducing its shear modulus. Hydrating the protein layer also decreases its Young&#x27;s modulus, which is expected to improve the fracture energy and strength of a composite with alternating hard and soft layers.

The statistical variation of the platelets has a negative effect on the mechanical performance (stiffness, strength, and energy absorption) because statistical variation precipitates localization of deformation. However, the negative effects of statistical variations can be offset by interfaces with large strain at failure accompanied by strain hardening. On the other hand, the fracture toughness of nacre increases with moderate statistical variations which creates tough regions where the crack gets pinned. But, higher statistical variations generates very weak regions which allows the crack to propagate without much resistance causing the fracture toughness to decrease. Studies have shown that this weak structural defects act as dissipative topological defects coupled by an elastic distortion.

===Formation===
The process of how nacre is formed is not completely clear. It has been observed in &quot;Pinna nobilis&quot;, where it starts as tiny particles (~50–80 nm) grouping together inside a natural material. These particles line up in a way that resembles fibers, and they continue to multiply. When there are enough particles, they come together to form early stages of nacre. The growth of nacre is regulated by organic substances that determine how and when the nacre crystals start and develop. 

Each crystal, which can be thought of as a &quot;brick&quot;, is thought to rapidly grow to match the full height of the layer of nacre. They continue to grow until they meet the surrounding bricks. This produces the hexagonal close-packing characteristic of nacre. The growth of these bricks can be initiated in various ways such as from randomly scattered elements within the organic layer, well-defined arrangements of proteins, or they may expand from mineral bridges coming from the layer underneath. 

What sets nacre apart from fibrous aragonite, a similarly formed but brittle mineral, is the speed at which it grows in a certain direction (roughly perpendicular to the shell). This growth is slow in nacre, but fast in fibrous aragonite.

A 2021 paper in &quot;Nature Physics&quot; examined nacre from &quot;Unio pictorum&quot;, noting that in each case the initial layers of nacre laid down by the organism contained spiral defects. Defects that spiralled in opposite directions created distortions in the material that drew them towards each other as the layers built up until they merged and cancelled each other out. Later layers of nacre were found to be uniform and ordered in structure.

===Function===

Nacre is secreted by the epithelial cells of the mantle tissue of various molluscs. The nacre is continuously deposited onto the inner surface of the shell, the iridescent &quot;nacreous layer&quot;, commonly known as &quot;mother-of-pearl&quot;. The layers of nacre smooth the shell surface and help defend the soft tissues against parasites and damaging debris by entombing them in successive layers of nacre, forming either a blister pearl attached to the interior of the shell, or a free pearl within the mantle tissues. The process is called &quot;encystation&quot; and it continues as long as the mollusc lives.

===In different mollusc groups===
The form of nacre varies from group to group. In bivalves, the nacre layer is formed of single crystals in a hexagonal close packing. In gastropods, crystals are twinned, and in cephalopods, they are pseudohexagonal monocrystals, which are often twinned.

==Commercial sources==
The main commercial sources of mother-of-pearl have been the pearl oyster, freshwater pearl mussels, and to a lesser extent the abalone, popular for their sturdiness and beauty in the latter half of the 19th century.

Widely used for pearl buttons especially during the 1900s, were the shells of the great green turban snail &quot;Turbo marmoratus&quot; and the large top snail, &quot;Tectus niloticus&quot;. The international trade in mother-of-pearl is governed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, an agreement signed by more than 170 countries.

==Uses==
===Decorative ===
====Architecture====
Both black and white nacre are used for architectural purposes. The natural nacre may be artificially tinted to almost any color. Nacre tesserae may be cut into shapes and laminated to a ceramic tile or marble base. The tesserae are hand-placed and closely sandwiched together, creating an irregular mosaic or pattern (such as a weave). The laminated material is typically about thick. The tesserae are then lacquered and polished creating a durable and glossy surface. Instead of using a marble or tile base, the nacre tesserae can be glued to fiberglass. The result is a lightweight material that offers a seamless installation and there is no limit to the sheet size. Nacre sheets may be used on interior floors, exterior and interior walls, countertops, doors and ceilings. Insertion into architectural elements, such as columns or furniture is easily accomplished.

====Musical instruments====
Nacre inlay is often used for music keys and other decorative motifs on musical instruments. Many accordion and concertina bodies are completely covered in nacre, and some guitars have fingerboard or headstock inlays made of nacre (or imitation pearloid plastic inlays). The bouzouki and baglamas (Greek plucked string instruments of the lute family) typically feature nacre decorations, as does the related Middle Eastern oud (typically around the sound holes and on the back of the instrument). Bows of stringed instruments such as the violin and cello often have mother-of-pearl inlay at the frog. It is traditionally used on saxophone keytouches, as well as the valve buttons of trumpets and other brass instruments. The Middle Eastern goblet drum (darbuka) is commonly decorated by mother-of-pearl.

====Indian mother-of-pearl art====
At the end of 19th century, Anukul Munsi was the first accomplished artist who successfully carved the shells of oysters to give a shape of human being which led to the invention of new horizon in Indian contemporary art. For the British Empire Exhibition in 1924, he received a gold medal. His eldest son Annada Munshi is credited with drawing &quot;Indian Swadesi Movement&quot; in the form of Indian advertising. Anukul Charan Munshi&#x27;s third son Manu Munshi was one of the finest mother-of-pearl artists in the middle of 20th century. As the best example of &quot;Charu and Karu art of Bengal,&quot; the former Chief Minister of West Bengal, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, sent Manu&#x27;s artwork, &quot;Gandhiji&#x27;s Noakhali Abhiyan&quot;, to the United States. Numerous illustrious figures, such as Satyajit Ray, Bidhan Chandra Roy, Barrister Subodh Chandra Roy, Subho Tagore, Humayun Kabir, Jehangir Kabir, as well as his elder brother Annada Munshi, were among the patrons of his works of art. &quot;Indira Gandhi&quot; was one of his famous mother of pearl works of art. He is credited with portraying Tagore in various creative stances that were skillfully carved into metallic plates. His cousin Pratip Munshi was also a famed mother-of-pearl artist.

====Other ====
Mother-of-pearl buttons are used in clothing either for functional or decorative purposes. The Pearly Kings and Queens are an elaborate example of this.

It is sometimes used in the decorative grips of firearms, and in other gun furniture.

Mother-of-pearl is sometimes used to make spoon-like utensils for caviar (i.e. caviar servers) so as to not spoil the taste with metallic spoons.


===Biomedical use===

The biotech company Marine Biomedical, formed by a collaboration between the University of Western Australia Medical School and a Broome pearling business, is developing a product nacre to create &quot;PearlBone&quot;, which could be used on patients needing bone grafting and reconstructive surgery. The company is applying for regulatory approval in Australia and several other countries, and is expecting it to be approved for clinical use around 2024–5. It is intended to build a factory in the Kimberley region, where pearl shells are plentiful, which would grind the nacre into a product fit for use in biomedical products. Future applications could include dental fillings and spinal surgery.

== Manufactured nacre ==
In 2012, researchers created calcium-based nacre in the laboratory by mimicking its natural growth process.

In 2014, researchers used lasers to create an analogue of nacre by engraving networks of wavy 3D &quot;micro-cracks&quot; in glass. When the slides were subjected to an impact, the micro-cracks absorbed and dispersed the energy, keeping the glass from shattering. Altogether, treated glass was reportedly 200 times tougher than untreated glass.

<text>Floating raft is a land-based building foundation that protects it against settlement and liquefaction of soft soil from seismic activity. It was a necessary innovation in the development of tall buildings in the wet soil of Chicago in the 19th century, when it was developed by John Wellborn Root who came up with the idea of interlacing the concrete slab with steel beams. The earliest precursor to the modern version may be the concrete rafts developed for the building of Millbank Prison in 1815 by Robert Smirke.

For a floating raft foundation – or simply &quot;floating foundation&quot; – the foundation has a volume such that, if that volume filled with soil, it would be equal in weight to the total weight of the structure.

When the soil is so soft that not even friction piles will support the building load, these types of foundation are the final option and makes the building behave like a boat: obeying Archimedes&#x27; principle, buoyed up by the weight of the earth displaced in creating the foundation.

<text>Paul Friedrich August Renner (9 August 1878 – 25 April 1956) was a German typeface designer, author, and founder of the Master School for Germany&#x27;s Printers in Munich. In 1927, he designed the Futura typeface, which became one of the most successful and most-used types of the 20th century.

Renner was born in Wernigerode, and died in Hödingen (today part of Überlingen, Germany).

He had a strict Protestant upbringing, being educated in a 19th-century Gymnasium. He was brought up to have a sense of leadership, duty and responsibility. He disliked abstract art and many forms of modern culture, such as jazz, cinema, and dancing. But equally, he admired the functionalist strain in modernism. Thus, Renner can be seen as a bridge between the traditional (19th century) and the modern (20th century). He attempted to fuse the Gothic and the roman typefaces.

Renner was a prominent member of the Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation). Two of his major texts are &quot;Typografie als Kunst&quot; (Typography as Art) and &quot;Die Kunst der Typographie&quot; (The Art of Typography). He created a new set of guidelines for good book design and invented the popular Futura, a geometric sans-serif font used by many typographers throughout the 20th century and today. The typeface Architype Renner is based upon Renner&#x27;s early experimental exploration of geometric letterforms for the Futura typeface, most of which were deleted from the face&#x27;s character set before it was issued. Tasse, a 1994 typeface is a revival of Renner&#x27;s 1953 typeface Steile Futura.

Renner was a friend of the German typographer Jan Tschichold and a key participant in the heated ideological and artistic debates of that time.

==Politics==
Even before 1932, Renner made his opposition to the Nazis very clear, notably in his book “Kulturbolschewismus?” (Cultural Bolshevism?). He was unable to find a German publisher, so it was published by his Swiss friend Eugen Rentsch. While designing his typeface Futura, Renner appeared at a public forum in Munich with several other German authors to speak out against the Nazis and other right-leaning parties who criticized anything that deviated from tradition as being &quot;cultural bolshevism.&quot;

After the Nazis seized power in March 1933, Renner was arrested and dismissed from his post in Munich in 1933, and subsequently emigrated to Switzerland. Soon after the book&#x27;s publication, it was withdrawn from the German book market, until a photo-mechanical reprint was issued by Stroemfeld Verlag, Frankfurt am Main/Basel, in 2003. The new edition included comments by Roland Reuss and Peter Staengle (a main source for these notes).

<text>The Focke-Wulf Fw 187 &quot;Falke&quot; (&quot;Falcon&quot;) was a German aircraft designed in 1935. It was conceived by Kurt Tank as a twin-engine, high-performance fighter, but the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; saw no role for the design, perceiving it as intermediate between the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110. Later prototypes were adapted to two-seats to compete with the Bf 110 in the heavy fighter (&quot;Zerstörer&quot;) role, but only nine aircraft were built in total.

==Design and development==
In the early to mid-1930s, developments in airframe design outpaced available aircraft engine power. Consequently, some designs with two engines outperformed aircraft with just one engine. In European air races, the Dornier Do 17 - a military design concealed under the guise of civilian use - proved faster than single-engined fighters. Although the period of twin-engine superiority was brief, it sparked the idea in Nazi Germany of the &quot;schnellbomber&quot; (fast bomber), which defensive fighters could not catch. Other air forces also developed twin-engine fighters.

In 1935, Kurt Tank suggested creating a long-range single-seat fighter as a private venture within Focke-Wulf. The idea was not to produce a heavy fighter or bomber destroyer like the Bf 110, but instead a long-range fighter with the performance of a single-seat design. Powered by the new 736 kW (1,000 PS) Daimler-Benz DB 600, it had an expected speed of 560 km/h (350 mph). The design was unveiled in 1936 at an exhibition of new weapons, prototypes and projects held at the Henschel factory at Berlin-Schönefeld, where it was viewed by high-ranking Nazi officials including Hitler. However, the Reich Air Ministry (RLM) rejected the design because the single-engine Bf 109 had comparable performance at half the cost. There was thought to be little need for a long-range fighter, as it was believed bombers would not need to be escorted.

===Prototypes===
Tank took the design to Wolfram von Richthofen, chief of the development section of the &quot;Technischen Amt&quot;, the research and development arm of the RLM. Richthofen was not so convinced that bomber performance would remain superior to fighters, and gave the go-ahead for the construction of two prototypes on the condition that they replace the DB 600, which was in extremely short supply, with the less-powerful 515 kW (700 PS) Junkers Jumo 210. The first prototype, the V1 (D-AANA), was fitted with 680hp Junkers Jumo 210Da engines. The second prototype, V-2, was fitted with 670hp Jumo 210G engines

R. Blaser was assigned to detail design. In order to improve performance compared with the Bf 110, the fuselage was made as small as possible. This meant there was no room on the instrument panel for the complete set of engine instruments, some of which were moved to the inside faces of the engine nacelles, as would also be done for the Henschel Hs 129 ground attack aircraft and some versions of the Bf 110. The engine nacelles were relatively normal, including both the engine and the main landing gear storage, but the front-mounted engine radiators were retractable for high speed when less frontal area was needed for the same airflow (an idea which was also used in the French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406). The mainwheels were fully retractable and faired. Unlike some contemporary designs, like the Bf 109, the wing and tailplane required no struts. The two wing spars passed under the pilot&#x27;s seat. As was common on pre-war designs, the line of the rear fuselage flowed straight into the line of the canopy, which created less drag than a bubble canopy, but also blocked direct viewing to the rear. Cutouts in the rear fuselage and the rear section of the canopy helped compensate for this. A small window panel was fitted by the pilot&#x27;s feet to improve his view for landing.

The first prototype flew for the first time in late spring 1937, with Hans Sander at its controls. In testing it demonstrated a speed of 523 km/h (325 mph) despite the use of the low-powered Jumo engines; 80 km/h (50 mph) faster than the contemporary Jumo-powered Messerschmitt Bf 109B, despite having twice the range, more than twice the weight, and using two of the same engines. Members of the RLM complained that this was due to faulty flight instruments, but further testing ruled this out. The Fw 187&#x27;s climb rate and dive rates were also on par - if not superior - to the single-seater.

Several changes were made to the design as a result of the testing, including new DVL propellers in place of the original Junkers-Hamiltons, and experimental twin-wheel bogies that were abandoned after testing. Blaser was concerned about flutter in the rudder at high speed and had a weight fitted to reduce it but in testing this caused so much flutter it was torn off at high speed. A second prototype followed with fixed radiators rather than earlier retractable versions, a semi-retractable tailwheel, changes to the elevator, and a vertical stabilizer with reduced chord. The engine was also upgraded to the 210G version of the Jumo, featuring direct fuel injection which resulted in a significant increase in power. New ejector-type exhaust stacks also contributed to increased speed by directing engine exhaust to the rear. Fw 187 V2 started testing in the summer of 1937, but crashed on landing when part of the main landing gear failed, and V1 was destroyed on 14 May 1938 after a high-speed pass over the Bremen facilities when the pilot, Paul Bauer, pulled up too sharply at the end of the pass resulting in a stall that sent the aircraft spinning into the ground.

===Two-seater prototypes===
Ernst Udet had replaced von Richthofen in 1936. An influential proponent of high-speed monoplane fighters, he nonetheless demanded manoeuvrability and doubted twin-engine designs could ever fully compete with single-engine types. Nevertheless, he felt the performance of the aircraft warranted development as a potential replacement for the Bf 110 in the bomber destroyer role. Even before V1 flew, Tank had been instructed to convert the design to a two-seater for this role despite the requirement for a second crew member in this role being marginal. The first two prototypes were already at an advanced stage of construction at this point, so two-seater work began on the third prototype which had just begun construction.

Blaser adapted the design by stretching the fuselage slightly but the inclusion of a second crew member altered the center of gravity which demanded the engine nacelles be modified to correct changes to handling characteristics. A new extended-length cockpit &quot;framed&quot; canopy was added, but due to the high line of the fuselage there was no easy way to include defensive rear-facing armament, relegating the second crew member to the role of radio operator. It was intended the offensive armament be improved by replacing two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns with 20 mm MG FF cannons, although these were never actually fitted.

Fw 187 V3 (D-ORHP) flew in spring 1938, but it suffered a starboard engine fire during one of the initial test flights and damaged its main landing gear in the resulting forced landing. It was quickly repaired and returned to service.

Two additional two-seat prototypes, V4 (D-OSNP) and V5 (D-OTGN), followed in the summer and autumn of 1938 respectively. While also powered by the Jumo 210, their performance was disappointing and led to a decision that any advantages of the new type would not warrant the replacement of the existing Bf 110.

The final prototype, Fw 187 V6 (D-CINY), was more heavily modified, receiving the originally specified 736 kW (1,000 PS) DB 600 engines, as well as a new surface evaporative cooling system for reduced drag. First flown in early 1939 it proved to have serious cooling problems (in common with other designs using the system, like the Heinkel He 100) and suffered some skin buckling and distortion. Nevertheless, during a series of carefully timed and measured runs in October 1939, the Fw 187 V6 reached 634 km/h (395 mph) in level flight, making it the fastest fighter in Germany at the time.

===Production run===

A small production run of three Fw 187 A-0 followed in the summer of 1939, based upon the V3 prototype and using the Jumo 210G engines. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, however, stated that without defensive armament the aircraft could not fulfill the &quot;Zerstörer&quot; role, and remained uninterested in the design. The three two-seat prototypes were returned to Focke-Wulf after testing at Rechlin. There was a brief study in the winter of 1942/43 as a night fighter, but the lack of room in the cockpit for radar equipment quickly eliminated it from contention. After rejecting the design, the RLM &quot;recycled&quot; their 8-187 airframe number to Junkers for their Junkers Ju 187 dive bomber prototype.

Tank nevertheless directed a series of studies based around new versions of the basic airframe in roles including dive bomber, night fighter, fighter-bomber, high-altitude interceptor (with greater wingspan and lengthened rear fuselage), among others. These designs explored a variety of engines including the Daimler-Benz DB 601, DB 605 and even the BMW 801 radial engine.

In time the Focke-Wulf Ta 154 &quot;Moskito&quot; resulted from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; requirement for a twin-engine heavy fighter like the Fw 187, but constructed from wood instead of light alloys. Due to the different material and construction techniques Tank made no use of the Fw 187 work, instead having to design a completely new aircraft to meet this requirement.

Surviving Fw 187s were apparently used as flying test beds during this program.

==Operational history==
An &quot;Industrie-Schutzstaffel&quot; (Industry-Defense Squadron) comprising the three Fw 187 A-0s was manned by Focke-Wulf test-pilots in defense of the factory in Bremen. Although there are claims that they scored several kills, it is likely that these were propaganda claims. The three A-0s were even sent to 13.(Z)/JG 77 &quot;Herz As&quot; (Ace of Hearts) in Norway and promoted as evidence that the aircraft was entering service to replace the Bf 110 (a similar scheme employing prototype Panzer VIs was also carried out), but by this time any such plan was long dead. The pilots reportedly found the Fw 187 generally superior to the Bf 110 in almost all respects, but the RLM quickly withdrew them from service. They returned to Focke-Wulf, where they were again used for plant defense. One Fw 187 was sent to the LSS (Luftkriegschulen) aerial gunnery school in Værløse, Denmark in 1942.

<text>Northwest Stadium is an American football stadium in Landover, Maryland, United States, located east of Washington, D.C. It is the home stadium of the Washington Commanders of the National Football League (NFL). From 2004 until 2010, it had the NFL&#x27;s largest seating capacity at 91,000; it currently seats 62,000. The stadium is owned and operated by the Commanders, with non-NFL events managed by Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment (HBSE). The stadium opened in 1997 as Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. It was known as FedExField from 1999 until 2024, when FedEx relinquished its sponsorship. The stadium was briefly known as Commanders Field before Northwest Federal Credit Union bought naming rights.

==History==
In the 1990s, Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke sought to replace RFK Stadium as the team&#x27;s stadium. Cooke considered a site next to Laurel Park Racecourse along Whiskey Bottom and Brock Bridge roads, but lack of parking and public support prompted him to choose to build instead on Wilson Dairy Farm in Landover, Maryland. A special exit, Exit 16 (initially Arena Drive, later renamed Medical Center Drive), was built from Interstate 495, also known as the Capital Beltway. Cooke named the site Raljon after his sons Ralph and John, registering it with the United States Postal Service for the stadium&#x27;s ZIP Code. Cooke died months before the opening of the new stadium, which his sons named Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. It opened on September 14, 1997, hosting a game against the Arizona Cardinals.

Daniel Snyder bought the team and stadium from Cooke&#x27;s estate in May 1999, briefly renaming it Redskins Stadium before selling naming rights to FedEx for 27 years at an average of $7.6 million per year. The stadium was renamed FedExField on November 21, 1999. The Raljon dateline requirements and placename were phased out by Snyder by the start of the 1999 season. From 2002 to 2010, the Redskins led the NFL in home attendance but demand declined thereafter. In the early 2010s, 14,000 seats were removed from the upper deck. By 2015, another 4,000 seats had been removed.

In July 2023, Snyder sold the team and stadium to a group headed by Josh Harris for $6.05 billion. The following year, Harris&#x27;s company Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment (HBSE) took over operating non-NFL events at the stadium.

On February 28, 2024, FedEx announced that it had opted out of its naming rights contract before its expiration in 2026. The stadium was temporarily renamed Commanders Field until a deal with Northwest Federal Credit Union was announced on August 27, 2024, to rename it Northwest Stadium.

==Design==

The stadium has five levels: the Lower Level, the Club Level, the Upper Level, and the Lower and Upper Suite Levels. The Lower Level is named after Bobby Mitchell, a running back and executive with the team from 1962 to 2002. The Club Level is named after Joe Gibbs, the team&#x27;s head coach from 1981 to 1992 and from 2004 to 2007. The Upper Level is named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle. The stadium has 257 suites .

==Other events==
===College football===
Northwest Stadium hosts the annual Prince George&#x27;s Classic college football game, which is a game usually between two historically black universities. It has hosted several other college football games, including a 1998 game between the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and Navy Midshipmen, a 2004 game between the USC Trojans and Virginia Tech Hokies, and the Army–Navy Game in 2011 and 2024.

===Soccer===

The stadium has been used for several international soccer matches. It hosted five matches of the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, including the United States&#x27; 3–2 quarterfinal victory over Germany. On March 28, 2015, Argentina defeated El Salvador before a crowd of 53,978.

The stadium has also hosted club soccer exhibition matches. During the 2005 World Series of Soccer, D.C. United hosted Chelsea F.C.; the game drew 31,473 spectators, D.C. United&#x27;s third-highest ever home attendance. On August 9, 2009, D.C. United hosted Real Madrid for another international friendly. On July 30, 2011, Manchester United ended its 2011 summer tour with a 2–1 win over F.C. Barcelona in front of 81,807 fans. On July 29, 2014, Manchester United played Inter Milan in the International Champions Cup. On July 26, 2017, F.C. Barcelona played Manchester United again as part of the International Champions Cup, drawing 80,162 fans and winning 1–0 on Neymar&#x27;s last goal for F.C. Barcelona. On August 4, 2018, Real Madrid beat Juventus 3-1 during the 2018 International Champions Cup. On July 23, 2019, Real Madrid defeated Arsenal on penalty kicks.

Northwest Stadium was considered but rejected as a 2026 FIFA World Cup venue.

===Rugby union===
On October 23, 2021, the stadium hosted a rugby union match between New Zealand and the USA Eagles that drew 39,720 people.

===Concerts===
The stadium has been host to several festivals, concerts, and tours, including the HFStival and Broccoli City Festival, the Reputation Stadium Tour by Taylor Swift, the On the Run II Tour by Jay-Z and Beyoncé, the After Hours til Dawn Tour by the Weeknd, the +–=÷× Tour by Ed Sheeran, the Renaissance World Tour by Beyoncé, and the Grand National Tour by Kendrick Lamar and SZA.

==Criticisms==
The stadium is regarded as one of the worst in the NFL. In January 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that former team owner Daniel Snyder met with Washington, D.C., officials and former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe about building a new stadium. In 2005, eight years after the stadium opened, 1,488 premium &quot;dream seats&quot; in three rows were added in front of what was the first row when the stadium was built. The stadium is about away from the Morgan Boulevard station, the nearest Washington Metro station to the stadium. Furthermore, federal regulations prohibit publicly paid shuttle service from public transit agencies when a private service is available.

In 2021, three water leaks occurred near two fans. In 2022, as Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was walking down the away team tunnel, a barrier separating seated fans from the away team tunnel gave way and caused several people to fall near him. According to several witnesses, team staff did not show care for or call for medical attention for the fans who fell, but yelled &quot;get the fuck off the field&quot;. The team released a statement responding to the criticisms, claiming the team did provide medical evaluations on site, but one fan denied that they did claiming that Hurts was the only one who asked if they were okay. Hurts later wrote an open letter about the incident to the NFL, asking that action be taken to prevent an incident like this from recurring.

<doc id="395595" wikidata="Q335817" url="?curid=395595" title="Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury">
<text>Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury (15 July 16601 February 1718) was a British Whig statesman who was part of the Immortal Seven group that invited William of Orange to depose King James II of England during the Glorious Revolution. 
Born to Roman Catholic parents, he remained in that faith until 1679 when—during the time of the Popish Plot and following the advice of the divine John Tillotson—he converted to the Church of England. He was appointed to several minor roles before the revolution, but came to prominence as a member of William&#x27;s government, under whom he served as Secretary of State in the 1690s. 

From 1700 until 1705, Shrewsbury was in self-imposed exile abroad, during which he married Countess Adelhida Paleotti. After his return to England he avoided politics until April 1710, when he was appointed Lord Chamberlain and joined the Tory government of Robert Harley, the Earl of Oxford. In November 1712 he was appointed ambassador to France and then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, returning to England in June 1714.

In July of 1714 Shrewsbury was appointed Lord Treasurer but in August Queen Anne died and George I succeeded her. The new Whig regime opposed Shrewsbury remaining in government and by 1715 he had lost all his governmental offices, although until his death he remained George&#x27;s Groom of the Stool, and he opposed Whig policies. He died in 1718.

==Early life and family==

He was the only son of the 11th Earl of Shrewsbury and his second wife, formerly Anna Maria Brudenell, a daughter of the 2nd Earl of Cardigan. His mother became the notorious mistress of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who killed her husband in a duel in 1668. On his father&#x27;s death Charles succeeded to the Earldom of Shrewsbury. It has been argued that the traumatic events of his early childhood left a permanent mark on him. 

Talbot was a godson of King Charles II, after whom he was named, and he was brought up as a Roman Catholic, but after the scandal of his father&#x27;s death, he was placed in the care of Protestant relatives: the earl of Cardigan (the new earl&#x27;s grandfather); the Hon. Mervyn Tuchett, later earl of Castlehaven (d. 1686), his uncle through marriage to Mary Talbot, the daughter of the tenth earl of Shrewsbury; William Talbot (d. 1686) of Whittington (a kinsman: the uncle of Sir John Talbot of Lacock and father of the bishop of Oxford); and Gilbert Crouch (the family lawyer). From 1674 to 1678, Shrewsbury studied in Paris. In the Spring of 1678 he joined the troops of James, duke of York, in preparation for an Anglo-French war; when this failed to manifest, he returned to England in June. In 1679, under the influence of John Tillotson, he became a member of the Church of England.

==Under Charles II and James II==

Shrewsbury was summoned to the House of Lords in 1680 and three years later was appointed Gentleman-Extraordinary of the Bedchamber, suggesting he was in favour at the court of Charles II. With the accession in 1685 of James II, Shrewsbury was appointed a captain and then colonel in order to defeat the Monmouth rebellion, but he resigned his commission in January 1687 after refusing to bow to pressure from James to convert back to the Catholic faith. In that year he entered in correspondence with the Prince of Orange; Shrewsbury&#x27;s home became a meeting place for the opposition to James II and he was one of the seven signatories of the letter of invitation to William in June 1688. In September he fled England for Holland and returned with William to England in November. Shrewsbury was influential in the making of the Revolution Settlement, arguing strongly in favour of recognising William and Mary as sovereigns.

==William III==

After the ascension of William and Mary, Shrewsbury regained his regiment, received the lieutenancies of Hertfordshire and Worcestershire, and became Secretary of State for the Southern Department, succeeding his uncle the Earl of Middleton. Shrewsbury resigned from William&#x27;s government in 1690 due to ill health and his opposition to the dissolution of Parliament and the dropping of the Bill that would have required an oath abjuring James as King. While in opposition he brought forward the Triennial Bill, to which the King initially refused assent. In 1694 he again became Secretary of State and was prominent in persuading the House of Commons to vote for the funds needed for William&#x27;s war against France; but there is evidence that as early as 1690, when he resigned, he had made overtures to the Jacobites and was in correspondence with James at his court in exile at Saint Germain, though it has been stated on the other hand that these relations were entered upon with William&#x27;s full connivance, for reasons of policy. Others aver that Shrewsbury himself was unaware of the King&#x27;s knowledge and toleration, which would explain the terrifying letters he was in the habit of penning to him.

However this may be, William affected to have no suspicion of Shrewsbury&#x27;s loyalty, although often presented with evidence against him. On 30 April 1694 Shrewsbury was created Marquess of Alton and Duke of Shrewsbury, and he acted as one of the regents during the King&#x27;s absence from England in the two following years. In 1696 definite accusations of treason were brought against him by Sir John Fenwick, which William immediately communicated to Shrewsbury; and about this time the Secretary of State took but a small part in public business, again professing his anxiety to resign. As Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire, he served as Colonel of the Worcestershire Militia in 1697. His plea of ill health was a genuine one, and in 1700 the King reluctantly consented to his retirement into private life.

==Exile==

From 1700 until 1705, Shrewsbury lived abroad, chiefly at Rome, whence in 1701 he wrote a celebrated letter to Lord Somers expressing his abhorrence of public life and declaring that if he had a son he &quot;would sooner bind him to a cobbler than a courtier, and a hangman than a statesman&quot;. He also visited France and Switzerland.

After the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 the Whig leaders, Godolphin and Marlborough made ineffectual attempts to persuade Shrewsbury to return to office. In April 1705 he left Rome for Venice, then for Augsburg, where he married Countess Adelhida Paleotti on 9 September 1705. He returned to England on 30 December 1705.

==Under Queen Anne==

He took his seat in the House of Lords in January 1706. Upon his return to England, Shrewsbury concentrated on the construction of Heythrop Park, eschewed London society and court politics.

However, he gradually became alienated from his old political associates, and in 1710 he accepted the post of Lord Chamberlain in the Tory administration, to which the queen appointed him without the knowledge of Godolphin and Marlborough; his wife was at the same time made a Lady of the Bedchamber.

Shrewsbury played a vital role as a conciliator between Robert Harley, the Earl of Oxford and Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke. He was an early supporter of the Tory efforts to negotiate peace with France to end the War of the Spanish Succession, concerned at the negative financial impact it was having on landowners. However, he was uncomfortable with peace negotiations that left out Britain&#x27;s ally, the Dutch.

After a diplomatic mission to France for the purpose of negotiating preliminaries of peace, Shrewsbury became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1713; but he was in London in July 1714 during the memorable crisis occasioned by the impending death of Queen Anne. On 29 July, when the queen was dying, the Earl of Oxford received his long-delayed dismissal from the office of Lord Treasurer. On 30 July, Shrewsbury and other ministers assembled at Kensington Palace and, being admitted to the queen&#x27;s bedchamber, Bolingbroke recommended the appointment of Shrewsbury to the vacant treasurership; Anne at once placed the staff of that high office in the duke&#x27;s hands. He was to be the last person to hold that position but the first to have been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Chamberlain and Lord Treasurer at the same time.

==Accession of George I==

Thus, when the queen died on 1 August, Shrewsbury was in a position of supreme power with reference to the momentous question of the succession to the crown. He threw his influence into the scale in favour of the Elector of Hanover, and was powerfully influential in bringing about the peaceful accession of George I, and in defeating the design of the Jacobites to place the son of James II on the throne. 

The new Whig regime opposed Shrewsbury remaining in government and by 1715 he had lost all his governmental offices, although until his death he remained George&#x27;s Groom of the Stool. Shrewsbury opposed the Whigs&#x27; attack on the previous Tory ministers and opposed their other policies in the Lords (such as the Septennial Act 1715), making contact with the Stuart Pretender and sending him money.

==Legacy==

The Duke of Shrewsbury was one of the greatest noblemen of the reign of Queen Anne. Though blind in one eye, he was strikingly handsome in person, his demeanour was dignified and his manners full of grace and courtesy. Swift described him as &quot;the finest gentleman we have&quot;, and as &quot;the favourite of the nation&quot;, while William III spoke of him as &quot;the King of Hearts&quot;. Like most of his contemporaries, he endeavoured to keep himself in favour both with the exiled house of Stuart and with the reigning sovereign in England; but at the two critical junctures of 1688 and 1714, he acted decisively in favour of the Protestant succession. At other times he appeared weak and vacillating, and he never wholeheartedly supported either Whigs or Tories, though he co-operated with each in turn. His magnanimous disposition saved him from the vindictiveness of the party politician of the period; and the weak health from which he suffered through life probably combined with a congenital lack of ambition to prevent his grasping the power which his personality and talents might have placed in his hands.

==Private life and death==

In 1705 Shrewsbury married, at Augsburg, Bavaria, Adelhida Paleotti, daughter of the Marquis Andrea Paleotti by his second wife Maria Cristina Dudley, fifth daughter of Carlo Dudley, titular Duke of Northumberland (himself son of Sir Robert Dudley (1574–1649), an Englishman turned member of the Tuscan nobility). This lady, who is said to have had &quot;a great many engaging qualities&quot; besides many accomplishments, was the subject of much malicious gossip. She was the widow, or as some declared, the mistress of a Count Brachiano; and Lady Cowper reported that the lady&#x27;s brother had forced Shrewsbury to marry her &quot;after an intrigue together&quot;.

After Shrewsbury&#x27;s return to England, the duchess became conspicuous in London society, where the caustic wit of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was exercised at her expense. She won the favour of Queen Anne, after the death of Prince George of Denmark, by her impulsive comment: &quot;Oh my poor Queen I see how much you do miss your dear husband&quot;. During the Paris embassy, she became extremely popular, due to her hospitality and lively conversation. Saint Simon thought that her eccentricity bordered on madness, but he did praise the simple, practical hairstyle which she made fashionable.

On the accession of George I, the Duchess of Shrewsbury became a lady of the bedchamber to the Princess of Wales, a position which she retained till her death on 29 June 1726. Shrewsbury left no children, and at his death the dukedom became extinct, the earldom of Shrewsbury passing to his cousin Gilbert Talbot. Gilbert was a Roman Catholic priest living abroad and on his death in 1744 the titles and estates devolved on his brother George.

He died at his London home, Warwick House, Charing Cross, on 1 February 1718, from inflammation of the lungs, aged fifty-seven. He was buried in the family tomb at the parish church of Albrighton (near Wolverhampton), Shropshire.

==Cultural references==
The Duke is the central character in the historical novel, &quot;Shrewsbury&quot; (1897), by Stanley Weyman. As a minor but pivotal character, he was portrayed by Job Stewart in six episodes of the sprawling ensemble BBC serial &quot;The First Churchills&quot; (1969).

<text>was the post of the chiefs of the Kamakura shogunate in imperial capital Kyoto whose agency, the , kept responsibility for security in Kinai and judicial affairs on western Japan, and negotiated with the imperial court. Despite keeping security, the Rokuhara were also a sort of secret police and widely feared.

Rokuhara Tandai was set up after the Jōkyū Incident in 1221. The two chiefs were called and , respectively. Kitakata was higher-ranking than Minamikata. Like &quot;shikken&quot; and &quot;rensho&quot;, both posts were monopolized by the powerful Hōjō clan. The agency was destroyed with the fall of Kamakura shogunate in 1333.

<doc id="395600" wikidata="Q3277677" url="?curid=395600" title="Edward Villiers, 1st Earl of Jersey">
<text>Edward Villiers, 1st Earl of Jersey (c. 165625 August 1711) was an English peer, courtier, and statesman of the Villiers family. He was created Baron Villiers and Viscount Villiers in 1691 and Earl of Jersey in 1697. A leading Tory politician opposed to the Whig Junto, he was made Southern Secretary in 1699.

He persuaded the young writer and diplomat Matthew Prior to abandon his former Whig allies and vote for the impeachment of his fellow Kit Cat Club member and patron Lord Halifax. Jersey replaced Halifax as Prior&#x27;s patron.

==Origins==
He was the son of Sir Edward Villiers (1620–1689) of Richmond, Surrey, by his wife Frances Howard, the youngest daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and Elizabeth Home.

His grandfather was Sir Edward Villiers (c. 1585–1626), Master of the Mint and Lord President of Munster who was half brother of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham and of Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey. His sister was Elizabeth Villiers, the mistress of King William III, and was later Countess of Orkney as the wife of George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney.

==Education==
He was admitted to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1671.

==Career==
Villiers was Knight Marshal to the royal household in succession to his father. He was Master of the Horse to Queen Mary II and was Lord Chamberlain to King William III and to Queen Anne. In 1696 he represented his country at the Congress of Ryswick. He was ambassador at The Hague and after his elevation to the peerage (1697) was ambassador in Paris. In 1699 he was made Secretary of State for the Southern Department, and on three occasions he was one of the Lords Justices of England. In 1704 he was dismissed from office by Queen Anne, after which he was involved in some of the Jacobite schemes, using his wife, who was a Roman Catholic, as a useful go-between. In 1711 the Queen was reluctantly persuaded to bring him back into the Cabinet, but he died immediately afterwards.

==Marriage and children==
On 17 December 1681 he married Barbara Chiffinch (1663before 13 December 1735), only daughter of William Chiffinch (1602–1691), Keeper of the Privy Closet and a confidant of King Charles II, and his wife Barbara Nunn. By her he had two sons and a daughter:
*William Villiers, 2nd Earl of Jersey (c. 168213 July 1721); through him they are ancestors of Diana, Princess of Wales, and of her sons, Princes William, the Prince of Wales, and Harry, Duke of Sussex.
*Henry Villiers (died 1743)
*Mary Villiers (died 17 Jan 1734/35), who married twice: 
**Firstly to Thomas Thynne (died 1710) son of Henry Frederick Thynne and Dorothy Philips, to whom she bore a son: Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth.
**Secondly in 1711 she married George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne (1666–1735), without sons.

After Lord Jersey&#x27;s death, his widow took her younger son Henry to France, for the express purpose of having him raised in the Roman Catholic faith, to which she strongly adhered. This caused something of a scandal, as Henry was a minor and a royal ward.

==Death==
He died on 25 August 1711 of apoplexy. The Queen had just, with reluctance, appointed him Lord Privy Seal.

<text>The Battle of Coronea (also known as the First Battle of Coronea) took place between the Athenian-led Delian League and the Boeotian League in 447 BC during the First Peloponnesian War.

In 457 BC the Athenians had taken control of Boeotia at the Battle of Oenophyta, and spent the next ten years attempting to consolidate the League&#x27;s power. In 454 BC Athens lost a fleet attempting to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia; fearing revolts by the other members of the Delian League, Athens moved the treasury to their city from Delos in 453 BC, and signed the Peace of Callias with Persia around 450 BC. 

The Delian League was essentially an Athenian empire, and while Athens was usually successful at holding their possessions in the Aegean Sea, they were less successful on land. By 447 BC some of the men exiled from Boeotia after the Athenian victory there in 457 BC had returned home and began to take back some of the Boeotian towns. The Athenians under Tolmides, with 1,000 hoplites plus other troops from their allies, marched into Boeotia to take back the recaptured towns. They captured Chaeronea, but were attacked and defeated by the Boeotians at Coronea. The Athenians were forced to give up control of Boeotia. Boeotia was allowed to leave the Delian League in return for allowing the Athenians to leave Boeotia safely. The defeat led to revolts on Euboea and in Megara, which in turn led to further conflict with Sparta, contributing to the Peloponnesian War.

<text>Raymond Neil Combs Jr. (April 3, 1956 – June 2, 1996) was an American stand-up comedian, actor and game show host. He began his professional career in the late 1970s. His popularity on the stand-up circuit led to him being signed as the second host of the game show &quot;Family Feud&quot; in its second run and first revival. The show aired on CBS from 1988–1993 and was in syndication from 1988–1994. From 1995 to 1996, Combs hosted another game show, &quot;Family Challenge&quot;.

==Early life==
Raymond Neil Combs Jr. was born in Hamilton, Ohio, on April 3, 1956. He graduated in 1974 from Garfield High School, where he was an actor, senior class president, and Boys State delegate. He declined a nomination to the United States Military Academy and served as a missionary from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for two years in Arizona.

==Career==
Combs began performing comedy at Cincinnati&#x27;s Red Dog Saloon, where he developed his best-known shtick of audience sing-alongs of sitcom theme songs. In 1979, Combs sent a letter to David Letterman, asking for advice; Letterman encouraged him to continue in comedy. In 1982, convinced that he was better than the comedians whose acts he saw on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Combs left his job as an Indianapolis furniture salesman and moved with his family to Los Angeles. He did well in a competition with more than 200 other young comedians, and began doing audience warm-ups for NBC sitcoms such as &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; and &quot;Amen&quot;. He became so popular that other sitcoms changed their production schedules just so they could have him warm up their audiences. Johnny Carson heard the audience&#x27;s laughter and then invited Combs to perform on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in October 1986; the audience gave him a standing ovation.

In 1985, he appeared on an episode of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; as a background character. Around this time, he also guest-starred on an episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. In 1987, he appeared as a celebrity panelist on the John Davidson version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, and had a small role in the comedy film &quot;Overboard&quot; starring Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn (he was the local cop in the beginning hospital sequence).

===&quot;Family Feud&quot;===
In 1988, game-show producers Mark Goodson and Howard Felsher gave Combs a seven-year contract to host a new version of &quot;Family Feud&quot;. The program premiered on July 4, 1988, on CBS&#x27;s daytime lineup, and a syndicated version was launched on September 19. According to &quot;Family Feud&quot; announcer Gene Wood, Combs also toured extensively around the United States to promote the show, and made guest appearances on &quot;Card Sharks&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; to discuss the new version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; with respective hosts Bob Eubanks and Bob Barker.

On June 29, 1992, CBS expanded the daytime show from 30 minutes to one hour. A new &quot;Bullseye&quot; round was added and the show was retitled &quot;The New Family Feud Challenge&quot;. On September 14, 1992, the Bullseye round was integrated into the syndicated run, which remained 30 minutes in length, but was renamed as &quot;The New Family Feud&quot;. Combs was one of the most seen hosts on television during the 1992–93 season, with an hour and a half of &quot;Family Feud&quot; airing five days a week.

While Combs enjoyed hosting &quot;Family Feud&quot;, he grew increasingly frustrated by the rigid formula of the show. He pressured his agent to find new opportunities for him in acting and comedy.

Midway through the 1992–93 season, ratings for the show began to plummet. CBS cancelled the daytime version in early 1993, with the final new episode airing March 26 (reruns aired through September 10), as many CBS affiliates had dropped the show entirely by that time. The syndicated version was also on the verge of cancellation (as many stations had also dropped that or moved it into overnight time slots). Jonathan Goodson, who had become chairman of Mark Goodson Productions after the death of his father, Mark Goodson, in 1992, decided to replace Combs with original host Richard Dawson in the hopes of spiking ratings (Dawson&#x27;s return season initially drew good ratings, but was unable to sustain this strength long-term, and &quot;Family Feud&quot;″s second incarnation ended after the 1994–95 season). By all accounts, Combs was hurt by his dismissal from the show.

===Other appearances===
Combs also made an appearance for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as a guest ring announcer at WrestleMania VIII, where he amused the capacity crowd at Indianapolis&#x27; Hoosier Dome by lashing into the team of the Nasty Boys, The Mountie, and Repo Man with various scathing insults before being ultimately chased out of the ring. He later served as a guest commentator alongside Vince McMahon and Bobby Heenan at Survivor Series 1993 in a match of the Hart Family against Shawn Michaels and his Knights.

In addition to these two appearances, he appeared in various WWF/WBF celebrity editions of &quot;Family Feud&quot;. Heenan and Combs also struck up a friendship, which Heenan recounted in his autobiography, noting that he believed Combs felt pigeonholed by being a game-show host.

Combs portrayed himself in episodes of &quot;In Living Color&quot; and &quot;227&quot; in &quot;Family Feud&quot; sketches and made an appearance on the TNN television series &quot;The Statler Brothers Show&quot;, where he did a stand-up comedy routine. In October 1993, a &quot;Family Feud&quot; video game featuring Combs&#x27;s likeness was released for both the Super NES and the Sega Genesis.

Combs was master of ceremonies of the annual StarGaze charity events produced by Jim Kelly from 1993 to 1995.

==Personal life==
In July 1994, Combs was involved in a serious car accident along the SR 134 portion of the Ventura Freeway. He sustained an injury in one of his spinal discs, leaving him in severe and continuous pain. Combs also struggled with financial problems after the failure of two of his comedy clubs (Caddy Combs and the Cincinnati Comedy Connection) and his home in Hamilton, Ohio, went into foreclosure. In September 1995, he separated from Debbie, his wife of 18 years (with whom he had six children). The couple attempted to reconcile, but later refiled for divorce. It was never finalized.

Combs made several attempts to resurrect his television career. He taped a pilot for a talk show called &quot;The Ray Combs Show&quot;, but it was ultimately not picked up. Combs also hosted &quot;Family Challenge&quot; on The Family Channel from 1995 to 1996, and made a number of appearances on the Game Show Network.

==Death==
On June 1, 1996, police were called to Combs&#x27; home at 1318 Sonora Avenue in Glendale, California, over reports of a disturbance. Combs had reportedly destroyed most of the inside of his house, and had also been banging his head against the walls, though Combs later told the police that he fell in the jacuzzi. Shortly after police arrived, Combs&#x27; estranged wife Debbie arrived and informed them that Combs was suicidal and had spent the previous week in the hospital for a suicide attempt. He was taken by police to Glendale Adventist Medical Center, where he was assessed by a medical doctor and placed on a 72-hour psychiatric observation hold. On June 2, 1996, at around 4:10 a.m., hospital personnel discovered Combs hanging by his bed sheets in the closet of his room. He was taken to the emergency room, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival, aged 40. His death was ruled a suicide.

On June 7, 1996, Combs&#x27; funeral was held at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Glendale. His remains were flown back to his hometown of Hamilton, Ohio, where he was interred at the Greenwood Cemetery.

<doc id="395608" wikidata="Q793583" url="?curid=395608" title="Charles Montagu, 1st Duke of Manchester">
<text>Charles Edward Montagu, 1st Duke of Manchester, (&quot;previously&quot; 4th Earl of Manchester) (20 January 1722) was a British aristocrat and statesman.

==Early life==
Charles was born into the Noble House of Montagu. He was the eldest son of the former Anne Yelverton and Robert Montagu, 3rd Earl of Manchester. Among his siblings were Lady Anne Montagu (wife of James Howard, 3rd Earl of Suffolk) and politicians the Hon. Robert Montagu and the Hon. Heneage Montagu, both MPs for Huntingdonshire. After his father&#x27;s death in 1683, his mother married Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax.

His paternal grandparents were Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester and his second wife Lady Anne Rich (a daughter of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick). His maternal grandparents were Sir Christopher Yelverton, 1st Baronet of Easton Maudit and Anne Twysden (daughter of Sir William Twysden, 1st Baronet).

He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and succeeded to his father&#x27;s earldom in 1683. Warmly sympathizing with the Whig revolution of 1688, he attended William and Mary at their coronation, and fought under William at the Boyne.

==Career==
In 1697, he was sent as an Envoy to Venice to try to procure the release of British sailors, but the Venetians proved unwilling to negotiate. On his return in 1698, he was appointed a privy councillor. The following year he was sent as English Ambassador to France, remaining there until the outbreak of war in 1701. He was then briefly appointed Secretary of State for the Southern Department, a post he held between January and May 1702. He was then out of office until again sent to Venice, as Ambassador, but during his time there in 1707 and 1708, this negotiations (to persuade Venice to adhere to the Grand Alliance) were again unsuccessful.

In 1714, he received an appointment in the household of George I, by whom on 28 April 1719 he was created Duke of Manchester.

In 1719, he was one of the main subscribers to the Royal Academy of Music, a corporation that produced baroque opera on the stage. He also served as High Steward of the University of Cambridge from 1697 to 1722.

==Personal life==
On 19 February 1690, Lord Manchester married the Hon. Doddington Greville (1671–1720). She was a daughter of Robert Greville, 4th Baron Brooke of Beauchamps Court and Anne (née Doddington) Greville (who married Thomas Hoby after the death of Lord Brooke in 1676). Together, they were the parents of:

* Lady Doddington Montagu (–1774), who died unmarried.
* William Montagu, 2nd Duke of Manchester (1700–1739), who married Lady Isabella Montagu, a daughter of John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu and Lady Mary Churchill (the youngest surviving daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough).
* Lady Charlotte Montagu (1705–1759), who married Pattee Byng, 2nd Viscount Torrington, the eldest son of George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington.
* Robert Montagu, 3rd Duke of Manchester (–1762), who married Harriet Dunch, daughter and co-heiress of Edmund Dunch.

He died on 20 January 1722.

<text>Virginia Railway Express (VRE) is a commuter rail service that connects outlying small cities of Northern Virginia to Washington Union Station in Washington, D.C. It operates two lines which run during weekday rush hour only: the Fredericksburg Line from Spotsylvania, Virginia, and the Manassas Line from Broad Run station in Bristow, Virginia. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

Service to Manassas began on June 22, 1992; the Fredericksburg service started on July 20, 1992.

VRE is owned by the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC) and the Potomac and Rappahannock Transportation Commission (PRTC). The NVTC and PRTC are governmental entities that were created by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Local governments (such as counties and cities) within each commission&#x27;s geographic area are members of each commission. The service will undergo expansion as the result of a December 19, 2019 deal brokered between former Virginia governor Ralph Northam and rail company CSX Transportation.

==History==

Discussions about commuter rail service in Northern Virginia had occurred as early as 1964 at the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission, but died in the face of opposition by the freight railroads whose tracks offered ready access to core employment areas. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments eventually commissioned a regional feasibility study by R.L. Banks and Associates, Inc., and planning began in earnest for VRE in 1984. In the meantime, Washington Metro extended its service to much of the inner ring of Northern Virginia, including the independent cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church and Arlington and Fairfax counties, which are members of the NVTC.

By 1986, it became apparent that Prince William and Stafford counties and the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park could not reach agreement on how to support VRE by joining NVTC, so the Potomac and Rappahannock Transportation Commission was created for them. Legislation established a 2% motor fuels tax to support VRE expenses and other transportation investments.

By 1988, NVTC and PRTC established a VRE Operations Board, consisting of three voting members plus alternates from each of the two commissions, plus a voting representative of the Commonwealth of Virginia (currently a representative of the Director of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation). The following year, the jurisdictions participating in the VRE project agreed to fund it according to a formula that weighted ridership by jurisdiction of residence with a factor of 90% and population with a factor of 10%. Arlington and Alexandria agreed to contribute to the project and have paid each year approximately what their formula share would be. The cities of Fredericksburg and Manassas Park joined PRTC in 1990 and signed the VRE Master Agreement and became participating jurisdictions in 1992.

Spotsylvania County joined in February 2010 to allow construction of Spotsylvania station, which opened in November 2015.

==Operations==

Rail service operates Monday through Friday during rush hour in the peak direction, with trains traveling toward Washington in the morning and toward either Manassas or Fredericksburg in the afternoon. Service is suspended or reduced on some holidays.

Through a cross-honoring agreement, VRE and the MARC Train allow passengers to transfer to trains on the other system that are going in the opposite direction of the rush-hour commuters.

VRE operates on lines owned and maintained by Amtrak, Norfolk Southern, and CSX Transportation. In December 2019, the state of Virginia agreed to purchase large portions of the right-of-way and track on the CSX line, as well as the Long Bridge into the District of Columbia. The state will add parallel tracks and make other improvements for increased service on the VRE. Most of the Fredericksburg Line is on CSX tracks, while the portion of the Manassas Line west of Alexandria is mostly on Norfolk Southern tracks. Washington Union Station in Washington, D.C., the northern terminus for most VRE trains, is owned and operated by Amtrak, including the station tracks.

VRE&#x27;s trains were initially run by Amtrak. On November 5, 2009, VRE awarded a five-year, $85 million operating and maintenance contract to Keolis. The change in operations took place on July 12, 2010, two weeks later than planned, to allow Keolis employees to learn how to run VRE trains.

Ridership on VRE increased an average of 13% each year from 2000 to 2005, but fell 2% in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. VRE said passengers affected by track maintenance and heat restrictions were taking other forms of transportation. The trend reversed in the summer of 2007, with ridership up nearly 2% in June and 4% in July compared with the corresponding months in 2006. As of October 2016, VRE transports an average of 19,400 passengers per day.

In 2015, VRE extended its contract with Keolis for five years, with an additional option for another five-year extension in 2020. That option was exercised in 2020, so Keolis will continue to provide operational and maintenance services through June 2025.

Starting in 2015, VRE began a study of extending service to Haymarket via a short branch line from the Manassas Line, but found that ridership would not sufficiently increase to justify the estimated $660 million cost and ended further consideration of the line.

== Lines and stations ==
VRE&#x27;s fares are based on distance, with the 19 stations grouped into zones. The two lines diverge at Alexandria Union Station in Alexandria.

=== Manassas Line ===

The Manassas Line runs east–west along trackage owned by Norfolk Southern. Amtrak&#x27;s and , as well as trains bound for Roanoke, also use this line. VRE studied an extension of the Manassas Line west to the communities of Gainesville and Haymarket, but chose instead to pursue added service on the existing line to Broad Run.

=== Fredericksburg Line ===

The Fredericksburg Line runs north–south along trackage that was once part of the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac Railroad and is now part of CSX. Amtrak service to Richmond, Virginia, and points south (the , , , and runs to Hampton Roads) also uses this line. An extension to Spotsylvania opened in November 2015.
== Rolling stock ==
Virginia Railway Express commenced operations in 1992 with ten EMD RP39-2C diesel locomotives, 38 Mafersa coaches, and 21 remanufactured Budd Rail Diesel Cars from the MBTA. Morrison-Knudsen rebuilt the locomotives from EMD GP40s at a total cost of $5.9 million. Mafersa built the coaches new at $24.7 million, or $600,000–$700,000 per car. During Summer 1998, SEPTA leased some VRE Boisie Budds for the Regional Rail services. VRE sold 33 of the Mafersa coaches to the Connecticut Department of Transportation in 2004 for its Shore Line East service. QIT-Fer et Titane, a Quebec mining company, purchased the remaining five cars in 2008.

VRE operated 13 Kawasaki bi-level cars between 1999 and 2008, after which they were sold to MARC (these cars were originally procured as an option on MARC&#x27;s larger order). Starting in 2001, VRE also operated a number of second-hand Pullman-Standard gallery cars from Metra in Chicago. These were all replaced by new Sumitomo/Nippon Sharyo gallery cars from 2006 to 2017 as some cars returned to Metra and others went to the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, North Carolina.

Trains currently comprise one and on some occasions two MPI MP36PH-3C locomotives that pull their fleet of Sumitomo/Nippon Sharyo gallery cars. As of 2018, train lengths usually range from at least four cars to a maximum of eight cars.

=== Locomotive fleet ===
VRE also operated a pair of EMD F59PHI locomotives and 18 high capacity Bombardier BiLevel cars leased from Sound Transit from 2002 to 2008; they have been returned to Sounder and replaced by locomotives V50–V69 and the Sumitomo bi-level cars.

=== Coach fleet ===

== Safety and accidents ==

On January 5, 2006, at 6:45 am, Fredericksburg line train No. 304 bound for Washington, D.C., derailed at Possum Point, just north of Quantico. Four people, including the assistant conductor, suffered minor injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the derailment was intimately related to CSX&#x27;s maintenance practices: a switch point had been repeatedly identified as deteriorating, but CSX failed to replace it. Eventually, the excessively worn and chipped point caused the lead truck of a passenger car to derail—the fourth car on train 304.

On October 3, 2012, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell launched a review of &quot;multiple internal control issues&quot;, including reports of corruption and favoritism, that &quot;call into question the management of the Virginia Railway Express&quot;. For example, VRE managers disregarded warnings by a former employee, later borne out, that trains would hit the new Broad Run platform.

<text>Charles Middleton, 2nd Earl of Middleton, Jacobite 1st Earl of Monmouth, PC (1649/1650 – 9 August 1719) was a Scottish and English politician who held several offices under Charles II and James II &amp; VII. He served as Secretary of State for Scotland, the Northern Department and the Southern Department, before acting as Jacobite Secretary of State and chief advisor to James II and then his son James III during their exile in France.

==Life==
Charles Middleton was born around 1650, the only son of John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton, and his first wife Grizel Durham. He had two elder sisters, Helen and Grizel.

Originally from Kincardineshire, in the first part of the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, John Middleton supported the Covenanters, who appointed him commander-in-chief in 1644. After switching sides in 1648, he accompanied Charles II into exile, and Charles grew up in exile, returning home in the 1660 Restoration.

His father died in 1674 leaving him little except for the title and debts; in 1683, Charles married Lady Catherine Brudenell, (1648–1743), daughter of the Catholic Earl of Cardigan. They had four children; John (1683–1746), Katherine (1685–1763), Charles (1688–1738), and Elizabeth (1690–1773).

Middleton was described by Gilbert Burnet as ‘a man of generous temper, but without much religion’; he remained a Protestant until 1701, when he converted to Catholicism at the request of the dying James II.

==Career==
Middleton is thought to have spent 1669 to 1671 in France and Italy; in 1673, he was commissioned as a captain in the 3rd Foot, later the Buffs, which served in the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War as part of the Dutch Scots Brigade. By 1678, he was a Lieutenant-Colonel and governor of Bruges.
Shortly after this, he was suggested as Secretary of State for Scotland, in place of the Duke of Lauderdale. This went to Alexander Stuart, 5th Earl of Moray and in June 1680, Middleton was made envoy to Emperor Leopold I.

He returned to Scotland in July 1681, where he became a close associate of James and his wife Mary of Modena. He was appointed to the Scottish Privy Council and made joint Secretary of State for Scotland with Moray on 26 September 1682.

In 1684, he relocated to London and joined the English Privy Council in July and Secretary of State for the Northern Department in August. After James succeeded as king in February 1685, he was elected for Winchelsea and given the task of managing the House of Commons. Parliament was suspended for refusing to repeal the Test Act, while James&#x27; reliance on a small circle of Catholics made Middleton suspect as one of the few remaining Protestants.

He was present at the birth of the Prince of Wales in June 1688 and became Secretary of State for the Southern Department in September 1688. When James fled to France after the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, he remained in England; in 1692, he was held in the Tower of London for plotting to restore him and after his release, joined the exiled court at Saint-Germain.

He proposed a more moderate declaration for a Jacobite restoration than James&#x27; chief advisor and Secretary of State, John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort. He became joint Secretary of State with Melfort, responsible for correspondence with England and Scotland, and became sole Secretary of State after Melfort was dismissed in June 1694. In England, he was tried in absentia for treason and outlawed on 23 July 1694, and attainted on 2 July 1695.

He continued as Secretary until James&#x27; death in September 1701, when he was appointed to the Regency Council during the minority of his son, James III. Despite his wish to resign, he was persuaded to remain in office and made the Earl of Monmouth in the Jacobite peerage.

With his two sons, Middleton accompanied James in 1708 during the attempted Franco-Jacobite landing in Scotland and allowed to resign as Secretary in 1713. He briefly joined James in Scotland during the 1715 Rising, before returning to France, where he served as Mary&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain until her death in 1718. Granted a pension by the French government, he died on 9 August 1719 and was buried at the parish church of Saint-Germain.

<doc id="395617" wikidata="Q5344618" url="?curid=395617" title="Edward Nicholas">
<text>Sir Edward Nicholas (4 April 15931669) was an English officeholder and politician who served as Secretary of State to Charles I and Charles II. He also sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1629. He served as secretary to Edward la Zouche and the Duke of Buckingham in the Admiralty and became a clerk of the Privy Council. He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War and accompanied the court into exile, before assuming the post of Secretary of State on the Restoration.

==Life==
Nicholas was the eldest son of John Nicholas of a Wiltshire family. He was educated at Salisbury grammar school, Winchester College, and Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.

After studying law at the Middle Temple, in 1618 Nicholas became secretary to Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, lord warden and admiral of the Cinque Ports. In 1621 he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Winchelsea. He was re-elected as one of the Members for Winchelsea in 1624 for what became known as the Happy Parliament. Nicholas kept diaries of all the parliaments in which he sat. When Zouche resigned his office of lord warden to the Duke of Buckingham, the Duke, upon Zouche&#x27;s recommendation, on 9 December 1624 appointed Nicholas as his secretary for the business of the Cinque Ports. In 1625 Nicholas became the first holder of the office of Secretary to the Admiralty; shortly afterwards he was appointed an extra clerk of the privy council, with duties relating to Admiralty business. In 1628 he was elected a Member for Dover and sat until 1629, when King Charles decided to rule without parliament and in the event did so for eleven years. Appended to a copy of Charles&#x27;s speech at the dissolution of this parliament on 10 March 1629 is a poem of twenty-four verses in Nicholas&#x27;s hand, beginning:
:The wisest king did wonder when he spide
:The nobles march on foot, their vassals ride
:His majestie may wonder now to see
:Some that would needs be king as well as he.

From 1635 to 1641 Nicholas was one of the clerks in ordinary to the council. In this situation, he had much business to transact in connection with the levy of ship-money. When in 1641 King Charles I went to Scotland, he remained in London and was responsible for keeping the king informed of the proceedings of parliament. When Charles returned to London, Nicholas was knighted and appointed a privy councillor and a Secretary of State, in which capacity he attended the king while the court was at Oxford and carried out the business of the Treaty of Uxbridge.

Throughout the Civil War, Nicholas was one of Charles&#x27;s wisest and most loyal advisers. He arranged the details of the king&#x27;s surrender to the Scots on 5 May 1646, although he does not appear to have advised or even to have approved of the step. He also had the duty of treating for the capitulation of Oxford on 24 June 1646, which included permission for Nicholas himself to retire abroad with his family. He went to France, being recommended by the king to the confidence of the Prince of Wales.

In 1648 Nicholas wrote a pamphlet, &quot;An Apology for the Honorable Nation of the Jews&quot;, which called for the readmission of the Jews to England. It is one of the few examples of pro-admission writing that does not also call for the conversion of the Jews and is cited by Menasseh Ben Israel in his &quot;Humble Addresses&quot;, although Cecil Roth wonders whether the pamphlet might actually have been written by a Jew.

After the king&#x27;s death, Nicholas remained on the continent, concerting measures on behalf of the exiled Charles II with Hyde and other royalists, but the hostility of Queen Henrietta Maria deprived him of any real influence in the counsels of the young sovereign. He lived at the Hague and elsewhere in a state of poverty which hampered his power to serve Charles, but which the latter did nothing to relieve. Charles appointed him secretary of state while in exile in 1654. As an enthusiastic Royalist, in a letter dated 10 September 1657 to Sir Edward Hyde, Nicholas speaks of Cromwell,

... I conceive his Majesty should do well to set a good price on his head and all the heads of the chief commanders in Ireland and also in Scotland ...
Nicholas returned to England at the Restoration and duly took office as Secretary of State along with William Morice, a former parliamentary supporter. Nicholas was soon retired, much against his own wishes, in favour of Charles&#x27;s favourite Henry Bennet. He received a grant of money and the offer of a peerage, which he felt too poor to accept. He retired to a country seat in Surrey (the manor of West Horsley) which he purchased from Carew Raleigh, son of Sir Walter Raleigh, and there he lived till his death in 1669.

==Family==
Nicholas married Jane Jay, a daughter of Henry Jay, an alderman of London and had several sons and daughters. His eldest son was Sir John Nicholas, a Clerk of the Signet and Clerk of the Privy Council. His daughter Susannah married as his second wife the Irish statesman George Lane, 1st Viscount Lanesborough: like her father, he spent years in exile with Charles II, and by 1659 the couple were almost destitute, but was well rewarded after the Restoration. Susannah died in 1671.

His younger brother Matthew Nicholas (1594–1661) was successively Dean of Bristol, canon of Westminster and Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. His country seat was at Sunninghill in Berkshire.

==Correspondence==
The collected correspondences of Nicholas were published in three volumes by the Royal Historical Society in 1920.

==Arms==


The arms of Nicholas’s father were: &quot;Argent, a fess wavy between three ravens sable&quot;, a differencing of the arms of Nicholas of Winterborne Earls, Wiltshire.

In 1649, augmented arms were granted to Sir Edward Nicholas, blazoned &quot;Argent, on a cross gules an imperial crown or&quot;, which he bore in the 1st &amp; 4th quarters, with his paternal arms in the 2nd and 3rd quarters.

<text>A public interest defence is a defence in law that allows a defendant who disclosed classified or protected information to avoid criminal or civil liability by establishing that the public interest in disclosure of the information outweighs the public interest in nondisclosure.

In the context of secrecy laws, it may permit a whistleblower to disclose government misconduct.

In the context of journalism, publication of a story that the journalist reasonably believes to be true &quot;having regard for all the circumstances&quot;, even if subsequently found to be untrue, is protected against action for defamation in UK law.

In the United Kingdom, the Defamation Act 2013 provides a public interest defence.

==Official secrets==
The inclusion of the defence was a subject of debate in the legislative process of the Official Secrets Act 1989 of the United Kingdom. The defence was not included in the final Act. The defence was also absent in secrecy laws in other countries that were based on the Act.

In Australia, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 &quot;provides a means to report suspected misconduct by public officials&quot;, setting out how such a disclosure must be done to qualify for protection.

Canada has reformed its secrecy laws in 2001 by adding the defence in its Security of Information Act. However, its application is limited to situations in which the defendant has followed a series of steps set out in the legislation before making the disclosure, and the person&#x27;s purpose in making the disclosure is to reveal an offence committed by another person in their official duties.

The inclusion of the defence has been a subject of debate in Hong Kong in 2003 during its legislative process to implement Article 23 of the Basic Law in the media in Hong Kong.

The US does not have a public interest defence. Edward Snowden, a NSA contractor who leaked classified documents in the public interest, said he will return to the US and stand trial if he is allowed a public interest defence. Snowden has been living abroad since 2013.

<doc id="395623" wikidata="Q9374853" url="?curid=395623" title="William Legge, 1st Earl of Dartmouth">
<text>William Legge, 1st Earl of Dartmouth (14 October 1672 – 15 December 1750), was Lord Privy Seal from 1713 to 1714. He was a Hanoverian Tory, supporting the Hanoverian succession following the death of Queen Anne.

==Life==
The only son of George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth, he was educated as a town-boy at Westminster School. He subsequently went to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A. in 1689. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s barony in 1691.

In 1702, he was appointed a member of the Board of Trade and Plantations, and eight years later he became Secretary of State for the Southern Department and joint keeper of the signet for Scotland.

In 1711, he was created Viscount Lewisham and Earl of Dartmouth. In 1713, he exchanged his offices for that of Lord Privy Seal, which he held until the end of 1714. After a long period of retirement from public life he died on 15 December 1750. Dartmouth&#x27;s eldest son, George Legge, Viscount Lewisham (c. 1703 – 1732), had predeceased him, leaving a son, William. Another son of the first earl was Henry Bilson-Legge, who later served as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

In politics he was a moderate; though himself a Tory, he was prepared to work with the Whigs. He earned the regard of Robert Harley, another believer in moderation; Dartmouth in return remained a loyal friend after Harley&#x27;s downfall. He also had the confidence of Queen Anne, who praised him as &quot;an honest man.&quot; As a Minister, though far from brilliant, he earned a reputation for competence and hard work. He was also noted for discretion; foreign ambassadors complained that it would be easier to get information from a brick wall than from Dartmouth. In his private life, his fondness for laughing at his own jokes led to his nickname &quot;the Jester&quot;.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Dartmouth married Lady Anne Finch, third daughter of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Aylesford, in July 1700. They had six children:

* George Legge, Viscount Lewisham (born c. 1704, died 29 August 1732), father of William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.
* Lady Barbara Legge (born 1701, died 29 October 1765), married Sir Walter Bagot, 5th Baronet, of Blithfield Hall.
* Hon. Heneage Legge (born 1704, died 29 August 1759)
* Lady Anne Legge (born 1705, died July 1740), married Sir Lister Holte, 5th Baronet, of Aston Hall.
* Rt Hon. Henry Bilson-Legge, PC, FRS (born 29 May 1708, died 23 August 1764), Chancellor of the Exchequer three times between 1754 and 1761.
* Commodore Hon. Edward Legge, FRS (born 1710, died 1747)

Dartmouth was succeeded by his grandson, William, son of his eldest son George Legge, Viscount Lewisham, who died young in 1732.

The Dartmouth family lived at Sandwell Hall (since demolished) in Sandwell Valley.

== Legacy ==
The city of Dartmouth in Nova Scotia, Canada, is named for him.

<doc id="395632" wikidata="Q6131860" url="?curid=395632" title="James Craggs the Younger">
<text>James Craggs the Younger (9 April 168616 February 1721), was an English politician.

==Life==
Craggs was born at Westminster, the son of James Craggs the Elder. Part of his early life was spent abroad, where he made the acquaintance of George Louis, Elector of Hanover, afterwards King George I of Great Britain. In 1713 he became Member of Parliament for Tregony, in 1717 Secretary at War, and in the following year Secretary of State for the Southern Department. Craggs was implicated in the South Sea Bubble, but not so deeply as his father, whom he predeceased, dying on 16 February 1721, aged 34. Among Craggs&#x27;s friends were Alexander Pope (who wrote the epitaph on his monument in Westminster Abbey), Joseph Addison and John Gay.

James Craggs left an illegitimate daughter, Harriot Craggs, by the noted dancer and actress Hester Santlow. Harriot was probably born in February 1713 and she was married firstly in 1726 to Richard Eliot, having nine children including Edward Craggs-Eliot, 1st Baron Eliot and secondly in 1749 to John Hamilton by whom she had a son.

James Craggs also left two Illegitimate sons, each named James, by different mothers, Reference to these may be found in the Will of his uncle, Michael Richards, who left bequests to Harriot and to each of the sons. One of the sons died at sea in 1740 as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy under the name James Smith, but noted as being the natural son of the late Secretary Craggs.

In 1719 he was one of the original backers of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company which commissioned numerous works from Handel, Bononcini and others.

The Pink Panther comes across an unnamed housepainter (known as the &quot;Little Man&quot;) painting a house blue. Disgusted by the color blue, the Pink Panther swaps out his blue paint bucket with pink paint. What follows is a series of gags where the painter attempts to paint something blue, but each time Pink thwarts him in a new way, and paints the object/area pink - and all the while, the painter is completely unaware of the Panther&#x27;s presence.

After a repeat series of these gags, the painter finally catches an eyeful of the Pink Panther carrying his brush and bucket; enraged, the painter grabs a rifle and pursues Pink throughout the house. As the painter exits the house searching for his target, the Pink Panther, still inside the house, reaches out from a window and pours pink paint into the gun&#x27;s barrel behind the painter&#x27;s back. The painter aims his gun, but just before he fires, the Pink Panther shuts the window as a blast of pink paint shoots out from the gun and splatters onto the house. The painter continues shooting at the Panther, and, when all is said and done, the entire exterior of the house has been painted pink.

Having had enough, the exasperated painter collects all of the Panther&#x27;s pink paint cans and buries them in the ground. However, much to the painter&#x27;s surprise, this causes pink grass, flowers, bushes, and trees to sprout from the ground outside the house, as a pink sun rises into frame in the horizon, turning the sky pink as well. Overjoyed at the sight of his dream house, Pink gives the disheartened painter a smooch of gratitude before proceeding to fetch his belongings and move into the house. But just before he enters his new home, he paints the white man completely pink. The painter bangs his head against the Pink Panther&#x27;s mailbox outside in frustration as the content Panther strolls into his new house as the pink sun sets and the cartoon fades out.

==Academy Award==
&quot;The Pink Phink&quot; was the first Pink Panther animated short produced by DePatie–Freleng Enterprises and by winning the 1964 Academy Award for Animated Short Film, it marked the first time that a studio won an Academy Award with its first animated short. It is also both the only animated Pink Panther short and the only installment in the franchise to win the award.

==Laugh track==
A laugh track was added to the theatrical Pink Panther cartoons when they were broadcast as part of the &quot;Pink Panther Show&quot; aired on NBC, and this laugh track still appears when the show is aired on the Spanish language Boomerang TV channel, and the France Channel Gulli. Most American broadcasts currently air minus the laugh track. &quot;The Pink Phink&quot; can be viewed in its original form with full titles and sans laugh track on The Official Pink Panther channel on YouTube along with the MGM Television logo.

==Popular culture==
* An episode of the animated series &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; entitled &quot;A Silent Cartoon&quot; is a homage to this short; the short features Dexter (filling the role of the painter) trying to construct a blue laboratory, while an all-pink version of his sister Dee Dee finds clever ways to turn the blue lab into a completely pink lab.
* In the 2010 series &quot;Pink Panther and Pals&quot;, a scene from &quot;A Pinker Tomorrow&quot; in which the Pink Panther tricks the Little Man (Big Nose) to cover the outside of the house in paint, is a homage to the original short, but in a futuristic environment.

<doc id="395634" wikidata="Q6131858" url="?curid=395634" title="James Craggs the Elder">
<text>James Craggs the Elder (1657 – 16 March 1721), of Jermyn Street, Westminster and Charlton, Lewisham, Kent, was an English financier and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons from 1702 to 1713.

==Life==
Craggs was baptized on 10 June 1657, the eldest son of Anthony Craggs of Wolsingham, county of Durham, and his wife Anne Morcroft, daughter of Rev. Ferdinando Morcroft, DD, of Goswich, Lancashire, rector of Stanhope-in-Wardell, county Durham, and prebendary of Durham. He was educated at Bishop Auckland grammar school.
After following various callings in London, Craggs, who was a person of considerable financial ability, entered the service of the Duchess of Marlborough. Through her influence he was returned at the 1702 English general election as Member of Parliament for Grampound. He retained the seat until the 1713 British general election.

Craggs was in business as an army clothier and held several official positions, becoming joint Postmaster-General in 1715. Making the most of his opportunities in all these capacities, he amassed a great deal of money. Craggs also increased his wealth by mixing in the affairs of the South Sea Company, but after his death an act of parliament confiscated all the property which he had acquired since December 1719. He left an enormous fortune when he died in disgrace for his involvement in the South Sea Bubble, a month after the death of his son. It is possible that Craggs the Elder committed suicide.

He married Elizabeth Richards, daughter of the Irish artillery officer Jacob Richards corn chandler, of Westminster on 4 January 1684. Their children included James Craggs the Younger, and Anne Craggs, wife of Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent, Elizabeth wife of Edward Eliot and Margaret wife, firstly of Samuel Trefusis and secondly of Sir John Hinde Cotton.

<doc id="395637" wikidata="Q7343394" url="?curid=395637" title="Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness">
<text>Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness, (17 May 1718 – 16 May 1778), known before 1721 as Lord Darcy and Conyers, was a British diplomat and politician.

==Career==
In 1741 he collaborated with G.F. Handel in the production of Deidamia. From 1744 to 1746 he was ambassador at Venice and from 1749 to 1751 he represented his country at The Hague. In 1751 he became Secretary of State for the Southern Department, transferring in 1754 to the Northern Department, and he remained in office until March 1761, when he was dismissed by King George III in favour of Lord Bute, although he had largely been a cipher in that position to the stronger personalities of his colleagues, successively the Duke of Newcastle, Thomas Robinson, Henry Fox, and William Pitt the Elder. From 1771 to 1776 he acted as governor to two of the King&#x27;s sons, a solemn phantom as Horace Walpole calls him. He left no sons who survived childhood, and all his titles became extinct except the Baronies of Darcy de Knayth and Conyers, which were baronies by writ inherited from his father, and the Portuguese countship of Mértola, inherited from his mother. In those peerages, he was succeeded by his daughter, Amelia Osborne, Marchioness of Carmarthen.

David Hume wrote, &quot;It is remarkable that this family of d&#x27;Arcy [sic] seems to be the only male descendant of any of the Conqueror&#x27;s barons now remaining among the Peers. Lord Holdernessae [sic] is the heir of that family&quot;.

==Family==
He was the only surviving son of Robert Darcy, 3rd Earl of Holderness, and his wife Lady Frederica Schomberg. On 29 October 1743, Darcy married Mary Doublet, daughter of Francis Doublet and Constantia Van-der-Beck. The couple had three children, only one of whom survived childhood:
*George Darcy, Lord Darcy and Conyers (September 1745 – 27 September 1747)
*Thomas Darcy, Lord Darcy and Conyers (born and died 1750), buried 29 July 1750 in the Great or St. James Church in The Hague, the Netherlands
*Lady Amelia Darcy (12 October 1754 – 27 January 1784); married firstly Francis Osborne, Marquess of Carmarthen, and had issue. The couple divorced in 1779. She married secondly John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Byron, father of Lord Byron, and had one daughter, Augusta Leigh.

<doc id="395640" wikidata="Q337754" url="?curid=395640" title="Thomas Robinson, 1st Baron Grantham">
<text>Thomas Robinson, 1st Baron Grantham, (c. 169530 September 1770), of Newby, Yorkshire, was a British diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1727 and 1761.

==Early life==
Robinson was a younger son of Sir William Robinson, Bt (1655–1736) of Newby-on-Swale, Yorkshire, who was Member of Parliament for York from 1697 to 1722. His elder brother was Rear Admiral Sir Tancred Robinson.

He was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1712, gained a scholarship in 1714, and graduated B.A. 1716, M.A. 1719. He gained a fellowship at Trinity in 1718, and was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1723.

==Career==
Robinson gained his earliest diplomatic experience in Paris. At the 1727 British general election he was returned as Member of Parliament for the pocket borough of Thirsk on the Frankland interest, after his eldest brother, for whom the seat had originally been intended, resigned his pretensions to him. He was absent, presumably on account of his diplomatic duties, from all the recorded divisions of that Parliament. After Paris he went to Vienna, where he was English ambassador from 1730 to 1748. During 1741 he sought to make peace between the empress Maria Theresa and Frederick the Great, but in vain, and in 1748 he represented his country at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle. He was made a Knight Companion of the Bath in 1742.

Returning to England Robinson sat in parliament for Christchurch from 1749 to 1761. In 1750, he was appointed to the Privy Council.

==Southern Secretary==

In 1754 Robinson was appointed Secretary of State for the Southern Department and Leader of the House of Commons by the prime minister, the Duke of Newcastle, and it was on this occasion that Pitt made the famous remark to Fox, &quot;the duke might as well have sent us his jackboot to lead us.&quot; In November 1755 he resigned, and in April 1761 he was created Baron Grantham.

==Later career==
He was Master of the Great Wardrobe 1749–1754 and again 1755–1760, and was joint Postmaster-General in 1765 and 1766. He died in London on 30 September 1770.

He married Frances, daughter of Thomas Worsley of Hovingham, on 13 July 1737, and had two sons and six daughters. He was succeeded in the peerage by his eldest son Thomas.

The town of Grantham, New Hampshire in the United States of America is named after Robinson.

<text>The Cos Cob art colony was a group of artists, many of them American Impressionists, who gathered during the summer months in and around Cos Cob, a section of Greenwich, Connecticut, from about 1890 to about 1920. 

In a joking reference to their predilection for painting views of the vernacular architecture, group member Childe Hassam nicknamed the art colony &quot;the Cos Cob Clapboard School of Art.&quot;

==History==
Artists had been coming to Greenwich to paint since the 1870s, but the art colony began to form when John Henry Twachtman settled in Greenwich in 1889. The town was only a short train ride from New York City, yet retained a rural character that appealed to artists. Many of Twachtman&#x27;s friends came to visit him at his home; among them were Hassam, J. Alden Weir, Theodore Robinson, Henry Fitch Taylor, and Robert Reid. For longer stays, they boarded at the Holley House (now known as the Bush-Holley House), a rambling old saltbox overlooking Cos Cob&#x27;s small harbor. 

During the winter, Twachtman and Weir taught at the Art Students League of New York. Probably beginning in 1890, Twachtman established summer art classes in Cos Cob; Weir taught with him in 1892 and 1893. Many of the summer students were enrolled at the Art Students League. Among the artists who first visited Cos Cob as summer students were Elmer Livingston MacRae, Ernest Lawson, Allen Tucker, Charles Ebert, Mary Roberts Ebert, Alice Judson, and Genjiro Yeto.

Other artists associated with the Cos Cob art colony include Leonard Ochtman, Mina Fonda Ochtman, Dorothy Ochtman, Edward Clark Potter, Emil Carlsen, George Wharton Edwards, and Kerr Eby. The art colony also included many writers and editors, including Lincoln Steffens and Willa Cather. 

Members of the Cos Cob art colony were deeply involved in organizing the Armory Show, the exhibition that in 1913 introduced modernist European art to a vast American audience. The art colony formed its own hometown organization in 1911. The Greenwich Society of Artists (now the Greenwich Art Society) held its first exhibition in 1912 at the Bruce Museum, which opened to the public for the first time on that occasion.

<doc id="395643" wikidata="Q1797662" url="?curid=395643" title="Roland and Rattfink">
<text>Roland and Rattfink is an American series of animated shorts produced and released from 1968 to 1971. The main characters also made several guest appearances on &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; animated series. The series was produced by David H. DePatie and Friz Freleng and seventeen cartoons were produced.

== Plot ==
The cartoons concerned blond, muscular, handsome, pacifist &quot;good guy&quot; Roland and the many attempts by the evil, weedy, green-skinned (in most of the cartoons), mustachioed Rattfink to defeat or dispose of him.

Roland and Rattfink were both voiced by Lennie Weinrib (except in &quot;The Deadwood Thunderball&quot; where they were voiced by John Byner and Dave Barry).

&quot;Hurts and Flowers&quot; (one long, running joke about Rattfink destroying flower child Roland&#x27;s daisies) concludes with Rattfink getting killed and Roland leaving a daisy in a flowerpot on his grave. When Roland walks away, Rattfink&#x27;s ghost rises from the grave to throw the flowerpot at him.

== Filmography ==
== Home video ==
The series was released January 27, 2009 on DVD from MGM Home Entertainment/20th Century Fox Home Entertainment as a part of &quot;The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection&quot;. The individual shorts were released on DVD and Blu-Ray on June 28, 2016 by Kino Lorber, and are also available to stream on Hulu.

<doc id="395647" wikidata="Q513449" url="?curid=395647" title="The Ant and the Aardvark">
<text>The Ant and the Aardvark is a series of 17 theatrical short cartoons produced at DePatie–Freleng Enterprises and released by United Artists from 1969 to 1971.

==Plot==
The cartoon series follows attempts of a blue aardvark (voiced by John Byner, imitating Jackie Mason) attempting to catch and eat a red ant named Charlie (also voiced by Byner, imitating Dean Martin), usually doing so by inhaling with a loud vacuum cleaner sound. The aardvark character is essentially unnamed; in the episode &quot;Rough Brunch&quot;, he claims his name is simply &quot;Aardvark&quot;. Despite this, and his identification in the series title as an aardvark, in many of the shorts he refers to himself (and is referred to by the ant) as an anteater. The ant gives his nemesis a variety of names as sly terms of endearment (Ol&#x27; Sam, Ol&#x27; Ben, Ol&#x27; Blue, Claude, Pal, Buddy, Daddy-O). In several bumper sequences of &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;, he is called &quot;Blue Aardvark&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot; series was originally released by United Artists. Seventeen theatrical shorts were produced in the original series, and were subsequently featured in various television syndication packages, usually shown with DFE&#x27;s other characters such as the Pink Panther and The Inspector. Most of the 17 entries appear in their television syndication form (complete with an audible laugh track added by NBC-TV) on the video on demand service Amazon Video.

When &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot; first appeared on &quot;The New Pink Panther Show&quot; in the fall of 1971, the series became wildly popular, so much in fact that the duo became a featured part of the NBC series. Even though the 17 entries remained popular throughout the broadcast run of &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;, no new entries were produced.

The series used several unique production techniques for the period. The aardvark&#x27;s body was solid blue: his only clothes—a pair of blue shorts and matching T-shirt—were a matching blue. Similarly, Charlie Ant was solid red, and did not sport any clothing. As such, the character&#x27;s solid colors allowed them to stand out clearly against the multi-colored backgrounds featured prominently in the series. Charlie also sported half-closed eyes, as a sign of a bon viveur.

Musical director Doug Goodwin was responsible for the jazzy music score. Goodwin assembled an established group of jazz session musicians to perform the series&#x27; theme music and musical cues. For the first time in animated cartoons, all six musicians—Ray Brown, Billy Byers, Pete Candoli, Shelly Manne, Jimmy Rowles and Tommy Tedesco—received on-screen credit.

Art Leonardi was responsible for the main title graphic for all DePatie-Freleng entries. For &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark &quot;series, Leonardi expanded on a technique first introduced for the first Pink Panther cartoon, &quot;The Pink Phink&quot;. This entailed tearing paper into the forms of objects and characters to form stylized images.

==Additional characters==
There were additional minor characters in the series. Among them were the following: (all voiced by John Byner unless otherwise noted)

* &quot;Computer&quot; – a talking device purported to be a supercomputer, which the Aardvark builds to help come up with ideas to catch the ant; however, all these ideas fail, which turns out to be because the &quot;computer&quot; is not really a computer, but an automatic toaster. Its voice is an imitation of a young Paul Lynde. (&quot;Technology, Phooey&quot;)
* Cousin Term the Termite (&quot;Rough Brunch&quot;) - Charlie&#x27;s wood-devouring cousin, who is trying to stay on a diet despite his cravings.
* Aunt Minerva – one of the Gi-ants and Charlie&#x27;s aunt. (&quot;The Ant From Uncle&quot;)
* Tiny the Elephant, an ape, and a look-alike of Roland (from another DePatie-Freleng series, &quot;Roland and Rattfink&quot;) – Charlie Ant&#x27;s lodge brothers (&quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot;)
* An unnamed Green Ardvark – he is similar to the Blue Aardvark except barrel-chested instead of pot-bellied. He appears in &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Ants In My Plans&quot; and &quot;Odd Ant Out&quot; (in the latter, he is depicted wearing a cap); the first cartoon sees the two aardvarks squaring off over who gets to eat Charlie, while the second sees them battle over a can of chocolate-covered ants.
* Tiger (voiced by Marvin Miller) – a large tiger who protects Charlie from the Aardvark as a favor for pulling a thorn from his foot. (&quot;Scratch a Tiger&quot;)
* A scientist with a Boris Karloff-like voice (&quot;Science Friction&quot;)
* A nurse at an animal hospital (voiced by Athena Lorde) – she tended to the ant and the aardvark when they ended up in her hospital (&quot;From Bed to Worse&quot;)
* An anteater-eating shark (&quot;Isle of Caprice&quot;)
* A nearsighted lifeguard – despite wearing glasses, he tends to mistake the Aardvark for a dog (&quot;Dune Bug&quot;)
* A toastmaster ant – who gives a toast at an ant dinner event (&quot;I&#x27;ve Got Ants in My Plans&quot;)

==International versions==
* In the German dub, the Aardvark is a female anteater named Elise (Eliza) voiced by Marianne Wischmann while Charlie (voiced by Fred Maire) remains male. The cartoons are known under the title &quot;Die blaue Elise&quot; (&quot;The Blue Eliza&quot;).
* In the Latin American Spanish dub, the Aardvark is a male anteater voiced by Pedro D&#x27;Aguillón (original dub) and Javier Rivero (dub on some re-airings). Charlie (voiced by Álvaro Carcaño and Salvador Nájar) remains unchanged. The series title is &quot;La hormiga y el oso hormiguero&quot; (&quot;The Ant and the Anteater&quot;).
* In the Brazilian Portuguese dub the Aardvark is an anteater voiced by Ionei Silva. The series title is changed to &quot;A Formiga e o Tamanduá&quot; (&quot;The Ant and the Anteater&quot;).
* In the European Portuguese dub the aardvark remains an aardvark.
* In the French dub, the Aardvark is a male anteater voiced by Michel Gatineau while Charlie is voiced by actress Marcelle Lajeunesse. The title is known as &quot;Tamanoir et Fourmi Rouge&quot; (&quot;Aardvark and Red Ant&quot;).

==Revivals==
The first revival featured the characters as part on the 1993 incarnation of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;. The characters remained unchanged, though unlike the original 1969-1971 cartoons, they do not appear in their own segments but rather are included in segments featuring the Pink Panther (now voiced by Matt Frewer). John Byner returned to voice both Charlie Ant and the Aardvark.

The second revival occurred in 2010 as part of &quot;Pink Panther and Pals&quot;. Eddie Garvar voices the Aardvark, who retains his previous characterization. Kel Mitchell, using his natural voice, voices the Ant.

<text>The Blue Racer is a series of 17 theatrical cartoons produced from 1972 to 1974 created by Friz Freleng and David H. DePatie. The character&#x27;s first cartoon, &quot;Snake in the Gracias&quot;, was released theatrically on January 24, 1971.

== Production ==
The cartoons were directed by Art Davis, Gerry Chiniquy, Sid Marcus, Robert McKimson, David Deneen, Bob Balser, Cullen Houghtaling and produced by David H. DePatie and Friz Freleng. The majority of the cartoons were animated at the DePatie-Freleng studio, except for two done overseas: &quot;Aches and Snakes&quot; at Australia&#x27;s Filmgraphics studio, and &quot;Little Boa Peep&quot; at Spain&#x27;s Pegbar Productions.

== Plot ==
A fast-moving blue snake named the Blue Racer (voiced by Larry D. Mann) tries unsuccessfully to catch a stereotypically-Japanese beetle (voiced by Tom Holland), who is a black belt in karate. Both characters spun off from &quot;Tijuana Toads&quot; in &quot;Hop and Chop&quot; (the Japanese beetle) and &quot;Snake in the Gracias&quot; (the Blue Racer). The goofy crane from &quot;Tijuana Toads&quot; (Crazylegs Crane, who also repeatedly failed to collar the Racer and the Toads himself) also later appeared in the series as well. 17 cartoons were produced.

== Production ==
* Bob Holt voiced both the Blue Racer and the Japanese Beetle in the 1972 short &quot;Support Your Local Serpent&quot;.
* The Japanese Beetle&#x27;s last appearance was in the 1972 short &quot;Blue Racer Blues&quot;.

== Filmography ==
All cartoons were written by John W. Dunn.

== Other appearances ==
The Blue Racer (or a snake looking just like him) appeared in the 1978 &quot;Pink Panther&quot; cartoon &quot;Pinktails for Two&quot; where he mistook the Panther&#x27;s pink tail for a lady snake. In this film, the Blue Racer did not speak or move with super-speed.

== Home video ==
All 17 shorts were available on DVD and Blu-ray on May 30, 2017 from Kino Lorber (through their deal with MGM Home Entertainment). Extras included were audio commentaries and two featurettes.

<doc id="395667" wikidata="Q961331" url="?curid=395667" title="Pilonidal disease">
<text>Pilonidal disease is a type of skin infection which typically occurs as a cyst between the cheeks of the buttocks and often at the upper end. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, and redness. There may also be drainage of fluid, but rarely a fever.
Risk factors include obesity, family history, prolonged sitting, greater amounts of hair, and not enough exercise. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a mechanical process where hair and skin debris get sucked into the subcutaneous tissues through skin openings called pits. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and examination.
If there is infection, treatment is generally by incision and drainage just off the midline. Shaving the area and laser hair removal may prevent recurrence. More extensive surgery may be required if the disease recurs. Antibiotics are usually not needed. Without treatment the condition may remain long term.
About 3 per 10,000 people per year are affected, and it occurs more often in males than females. Young adults are most commonly affected. The term &quot;pilonidal&quot; means &#x27;nest of hair&#x27;. The condition was first described in 1833.

==Signs and symptoms==

Pilonidal cysts can be itchy and often very painful, and typically occur between the ages of 15 and 35. Although usually found near the coccyx, the condition can also affect the navel, armpit, the cheek, or the genital region, though these locations are much rarer.

Signs and symptoms may include:

*Intermittent pain/discomfort or swelling above the anus or near the tailbone
*Opaque yellow (purulent) or bloody discharge from the tailbone area
*Unexpected moisture in the tailbone region
*Discomfort sitting on the tailbone, doing sit-ups or riding a bicycle—any activities that roll over the tailbone area

Some people with a pilonidal cyst will be asymptomatic.

=== Pilonidal sinus ===

Pilonidal sinus (PNS): is a sinus tract, or small channel, that may originate from the source of infection and open to the surface of the skin. Material from the cyst drains through the pilonidal sinus. A pilonidal cyst is usually painful, but if it is a draining sinus, the pressure is relieved and patient might not feel pain.

== Causes ==

Hair insertion is the causative agent of pilonidal cysts. An analysis of 624 patients&#x27; cyst hair found that 74% of the hair was rootless, and resembled spiky, razor-cut hair rather than intact body hair. One proposed cause is ingrown hair, although hairs found in pilonidal sinus tracts have more often been found to originate from the head.

Excessive sitting is thought to predispose people to the condition, as sitting increases pressure on the coccygeal region.

Trauma is not believed to cause a pilonidal cyst; however, such an event may result in inflammation of an existing cyst; there are cases where this can occur months after a localized injury to the area.

Pilonidal cysts may be caused by a congenital pilonidal dimple.

Excessive sweating can also contribute to the formation of a pilonidal cyst: moisture can fill a stretched hair follicle, which helps create a low-oxygen environment that promotes the growth of anaerobic bacteria, often found in pilonidal cysts. The presence of bacteria and low oxygen levels hamper wound healing and exacerbate a forming pilonidal cyst.

==Differential diagnosis==

A pilonidal cyst can resemble a dermoid cyst, a kind of teratoma (germ cell tumor). In particular, a pilonidal cyst in the gluteal cleft can resemble a sacrococcygeal teratoma. Correct diagnosis is important because all teratomas require consultation with an oncologist and complete surgical excision, if possible without any spillage.

== Treatment ==
If there is infection, treatment is generally by incision and drainage just off the midline because incisions in the midline have a hard time healing well. Following five simple rules has been known to prevent recurring inflammations for some people and avoid surgery: 1. Avoiding chairs and car seats that put pressure on the coccyx; 2. Being of average weight, preferably with low BMI; 3. Keeping the area clean; 4. Keeping the area dry by wearing exclusively cotton garments; 5. Keeping the area completely hair free, for example, by regularly using an IPL hair removal device.

The evidence for elective treatment of pilonidal sinus disease is poor. The most commonly performed surgery is for the pilonidal sinus complex to be surgically excised with the wound often left open to heal. Post-surgical wound packing may be necessary, and packing typically must be replaced daily for four to eight weeks. In some cases, two years may be required for complete granulation to occur. Sometimes the cyst is resolved via surgical marsupialization.

A 2018 literature review of 740 records of surgeries that included recurrence rates found that primary midline closure surgeries resulted in a 67.9% recurrence rate within 20 years, and recommended that they should be discontinued due to the high recurrence rate. Incision and drainage had a recurrence rate of 25.9% within 2 years, up to 40.2% in 5 years. Phenol treatment has a recurrence rate of 14.1% at 2 years and 40.4% at 5 years. A 2024 study involving 667 people found that, compared with tissue-removing surgery, minor procedures (such as draining and pit-picking) were associated with less pain, fewer complications and a faster recovery. However, minor surgeries were less likely to resolve the condition.

Surgeons can also excise the sinus and repair with a reconstructive flap technique, such as a &quot;cleft lift&quot; procedure or Z-plasty, usually done under general anesthetic. This approach is especially useful for complicated or recurring pilonidal disease, leaves little scar tissue and flattens the region between the buttocks, reducing the risk of recurrence. This approach typically results in a more rapid recovery than the traditional surgery, however there are fewer surgeons trained in the cleft lift procedure and it consequently may not be as accessible to patients, depending on their location. Meta-analysis shows recurrence rates were lower in open healing than with primary closure (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.87), at the expense of healing time. Pilonidal cysts can recur, and do so more frequently if the surgical wound is sutured in the midline, as opposed to away from the midline, which obliterates the natal cleft and removes the focus of shearing stress. An incision lateral to the intergluteal cleft is therefore preferred, especially given the poor healing of midline incisions in this region. Minimally invasive techniques with no wound and rapid return to full activities have been reported but await double blind randomised trials.

Another technique is to treat pilonidal sinus with fibrin glue. This technique is of unclear benefit as of 2017 due to insufficient research. The evidence for any treatment is of low quality, and care must be taken not to over interpret any study in this field.

Since the 2010s, a number of minimally invasive techniques have been developed, with the purpose of minimising the impact of surgery on patients and of achieving less pain and shorter recovery times.

In some cases, the wounds are left open after surgery to heal naturally instead of being closed with stitches. There are a lot of different dressings and topical agents (creams or lotions) that are available for helping these open wounds to heal. A 2022 systematic review brought together evidence from 11 studies that compared dressings and topical agents for treating open wounds after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus of the buttocks. The authors concluded that: platelet rich plasma may help wounds to heal quicker compared to sterile gauze; Lietofix skin repair cream may help wounds to heal by 30 days compared to iodine (which helps to reduce bacteria in the wound); but it is not clear whether hydrogel dressings (designed to keep the wound moist) reduce the time it takes wounds to heal compared with cleaning the wound with iodine.

Endoscopic pilonidal treatment, which uses a small camera to guide the surgeon in removing hair, is a newer method of treatment that has minimal pain and quick healing compared to surgery. A literature review of 497 patients found that the average endoscopic operation time was 34.7 minutes, and the average healing time was 32.9 days. Failure occurred in 8% of patients, who had persistent disease or recurrence.

== Etymology ==

Pilonidal means &#x27;nest of hair&#x27; and is derived from the Latin words for &#x27;hair&#x27; () and &#x27;nest&#x27; (). The condition was first described by Herbert Mayo in 1833. R. M. Hodges was the first to use the phrase &quot;pilonidal cyst&quot; to describe the condition in 1880.

The condition was widespread in the United States Army during World War II. The condition was termed &quot;Jeep seat&quot; or &quot;Jeep riders&#x27; disease&quot;, because a large portion of people who were being hospitalized for it rode in Jeeps, and prolonged bumpy rides in the vehicles were believed to have caused the condition due to irritation and pressure on the coccyx.
