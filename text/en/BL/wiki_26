<text>Ann Lee (29 February 1736 – 8 September 1784), commonly known as Mother Ann Lee, was the founding leader of the Shakers, later changed to United Society of Believers in Christ&#x27;s Second Appearing following her death. She was born during a time of the Evangelical revival in England, and became a figure that greatly influenced religion at this time, especially in the Americas.

After nearly two decades of participation in a religious movement that became the Shakers, in 1774 Ann Lee and a small group of her followers emigrated from England to New York. After several years, they gathered at Niskayuna, renting land from the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, Albany County, New York (the area now called Colonie). They worshiped by ecstatic dancing or &quot;shaking&quot;, which resulted in their being dubbed the Shakers. Ann Lee preached to the public and led the Shaker church at a time when few women were religious leaders. She was often referred to, and considered, the female representation of God.

==Early history==

Ann Lee was born in Manchester, England, the second child of eight belonging to her parents. She was baptized privately at Manchester Collegiate Church (now Manchester Cathedral) on 1 June 1742, at the age of 6. Her parents were members of a distinct branch of the Society of Friends (a sect of Quakers) and too poor to afford their children even the rudiments of education. Ann Lee received no formal education, and remained illiterate throughout her life. Ann Lee&#x27;s father, John Lees, was a blacksmith during the day and a tailor at night.

It is probable that Ann Lee&#x27;s original surname was Lees, but somewhere through time it changed to Lee. Little is known about her mother other than that she was a very religious and pious woman. As often happened in those days, her mother&#x27;s name was not even recorded. When Ann was young, she worked in a cotton factory, then as a cutter of hatter&#x27;s fur. At the age of 20 she worked in a much less dangerous occupation as a cook in a Manchester infirmary which was also the local insane asylum.

In 1758, she joined an English sect founded by Jane Wardley and her husband, preacher James Wardley in 1747; this was the precursor to the Shaker sect. This sect was commonly known as the Shaking Quakers due to their similarities to the Quaker faith, but also the practice of cleansing from sin through chanting and dancing. Jane and James believed that the Second Coming was soon and that God would return in the form of a woman. Ann Lee was this woman, and later received her title of Mother due to this belief. Ann believed and taught her followers that it is possible to attain perfect holiness by giving up sexual relations because she believed sexual relations to be the great sin of Adam and Eve. Like her predecessors, the Wardleys, she taught that the shaking and trembling were caused by sin being purged from the body by the power of the Holy Spirit, purifying the worshiper.

Beginning during her youth, Ann Lee was uncomfortable with sexuality, especially her own. Partly due to her exposure to the Quaker religion while she was young, and her experience living and working in the city, seeing the sin around her. This repulsion towards sexual activity continued and manifested itself in her repeated attempts to avoid marriage. Eventually her father forced her to marry Abraham Stanley (or Abraham Standarin). They were married on 5 January 1761 at Manchester Collegiate Church. She became pregnant four times, but all of her children died during infancy. Her difficult pregnancies and the loss of four children were traumatic experiences that contributed to Ann Lee&#x27;s dislike of sexual relations.

These losses also led her to truly question and solidify her beliefs. Lee developed radical religious convictions that advocated celibacy and the abandonment of marriage, as well as the importance of pursuing perfection in every facet of life. She differed from the Quakers, who, though they supported gender equality, did not believe in forbidding sexuality within marriage. The shaking Quakers also believed in an inner light and personal revelation, which was in common with the Quakers.

==Rise to prominence==
In England, Ann Lee rose to prominence by urging other believers to preach more publicly concerning the imminent second coming, and to attack sin more boldly and unconventionally. She spoke of visions and messages from God, claiming that she had received in a vision from God the message that celibacy and confession of sin are the only true road to salvation and the only way in which the Kingdom of God could be established on the earth. She was frequently imprisoned for breaking the Sabbath by dancing and shouting, and for blasphemy. 

She claimed to have had many miraculous escapes from death. She told of being examined by four clergymen of the Established Church, claiming that she spoke to them for four hours in 72 tongues.

While in prison in Manchester for 14 days, she said she had a revelation that &quot;a complete cross against the lusts of generation, added to a full and explicit confession, before witnesses, of all the sins committed under its influence, was the only possible remedy and means of salvation.&quot; She saw a vision of Adam and Eve which told her that sexual relations were the root of all evil. She also saw that she would be the second appearance of Christ. After this, probably in 1770, she was chosen by the Society as &quot;Mother in spiritual things&quot; and called herself &quot;Ann, the Word&quot; and also &quot;Mother Ann.&quot; After being released from prison a second time, witnesses say Mother Ann performed a number of miracles, including healing the sick.

Lee eventually decided to leave England for America in order to escape the persecution (i.e., multiple arrests and stays in prison) she experienced in Great Britain. She also saw the religious Awakening in the Americas and was called to share her beliefs and religion.

==Move to America==

In 1774 a revelation led her to take a select band to America. She was accompanied by her husband, who soon afterwards deserted her. Also following her to America were her brother, William Lee (1740–1784); Nancy Lee, her niece; James Whittaker (1751–1787), who had been brought up by Mother Ann and was probably related to her; John Hocknell (1723–1799), who provided the funds for the trip; his son, Richard; James Shepherd; and Mary Partington. These 9 members sailed aboard the Mariah, landing in New York City. Mother Ann and her converts arrived on 6 August 1774 after three months of sailing. They stayed for nearly five years. In 1779 Hocknell leased land at Niskayuna in the township of Watervliet, near Albany. The Shakers settled there, and a unique community life began to develop and thrive. Not long after they arrived, Ann&#x27;s husband left her and she never saw him again.

During the American Revolution, Lee and her followers maintained a stance of neutrality. Maintaining the position that they were pacifists, Ann Lee and her followers did not side with either the British or the colonists. This caused contention towards the Shakers due to their refusal to sign an oath of allegiance. 

Ann Lee opened her testimony to the world&#x27;s people on the famous Dark Day in May 1780, when the sun disappeared and it was so dark that candles had to be lit to see indoors at noon. She soon recruited a number of followers who had joined the New Light revival at New Lebanon, New York, in 1779, including Lucy Wright.

Beginning in the spring of 1781, Mother Ann and some of her followers went on an extensive missionary journey to find converts in Massachusetts and Connecticut. They often stayed in the homes of local sympathizers, such as the Benjamin Osborn House near the New York-Massachusetts line. There were also songs attributed to her which were sung without words. In this mission they converted many, and 18 shaker villages emerged. Witnesses recorded that she performed many miracles during this time.

Ann Lee&#x27;s mission throughout New England was especially successful in converting groups who were already outside the mainstream of New England Protestantism, including followers of Shadrack Ireland. To the mainstream, however, she was too radical for comfort. Ann Lee herself recognized how revolutionary her ideas were when she said, &quot;We [the Shakers] are the people who turned the world upside down.&quot;

The Shakers were sometimes met by violent mobs, such as in Shirley, Massachusetts, and Ann Lee suffered violence at their hands more than once. The mission came to an end when Ann and her brother William were again attacked by a mob, and badly injured. They returned home greatly weakened. William died over a year later on July 21 1784. Ann died only a few months later on September 8, 1784 at the age of 48, likely hastened by the events she had undergone including the loss of her brother. She died at Watervliet and both William and Ann are buried in the Shaker cemetery located in the Watervliet Shaker Historic District. It was recorded that in her final days, Ann was &quot;singing in unknown tongues&quot; while sitting in her rocking chair.

The followers of Mother Ann came to believe that she embodied all the perfections of God in female form and was revealed as the &quot;second coming&quot; of Christ. The fact that Ann Lee was considered to be Christ&#x27;s female counterpart was at the time unique, although several women since then have claimed to be Jesus, and have been accepted as such by their followers.
It is claimed that Shakers in New Lebanon, New York, experienced a 10-year period of revelations in 1837 called the Era of Manifestations. It was also referred to as &quot;Mother Ann&#x27;s Work&quot;. However, the Shakers&#x27; numbers dwindled with time, and soon the religion gradually all but disappeared. In total 19 official communities were established in the Northeast with roughly 6,000 members prior to the civil war.

== Shaker beliefs ==
Shaker beliefs are aligned heavily with those of the Quakers, such as gender equality, community and pacifism; however, the Shakers differ from the Quakers in their belief in celibacy.

Lee believed that celibacy was preferable to marriage, and within marriage, sex was only appropriate for the procreation of children. After her marriage and the birth and death of four infant children, Lee thought that God was punishing her for engaging in sexual relations with her husband.

The Shakers were incredibly focused on a utopian community where everything was shared and everyone supported. They gathered in villages and lived in dormitory-style homes, encouraging celibacy. Due to the lack of sexual relations, the Shakers adopted children, and when they reached the age of 21 allowed them to choose to stay in the faith or leave to explore other things, giving the religion a way to continue through generations. Additionally, they worked hard to find converts.

The Shakers are known for their industry and inventions, including the screw propeller, Babbitt metal, automatic spring and turbine waterwheel. They were the first to package and sell seeds, and were once the largest producers of medicinal herbs. Additionally, they were known for their dances and songs as folk art and their craftsmanship. Shaker furniture is prized today due to its functional beauty and lasting nature.

<doc id="398317" wikidata="Q17148426" url="?curid=398317" title="Nationalism and sport">
<text>[[Nationalism#Sport|Nationalism]] and [[sport]] are often intertwined, as sports provide a venue for symbolic competition between nations; sports competition often reflects national conflict, and in fact has often been a tool of diplomacy. The involvement of political goals in sport is seen by some as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake, for the enjoyment of its participants, but this involvement has been true throughout the history of sport.

== Sports diplomacy ==

Most sports are contested between national teams, which encourages the use of sporting events for nationalist purposes, whether intentionally or not. The signalling of national solidarity through sport is one of the primary forms of banal nationalism.

Several sporting events are a matter of national pride; The Ashes is a matter of national pride between England and Australia. Also in cricket an India versus Pakistan match puts both countries on a virtual standstill as if it were all about national pride during those matches.

The Olympic Games are the premier stage for nationalist competition, and its history reflects the history of political conflict since its inception at the end of the 19th century. The 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin was an illustration, maybe best acknowledged in hindsight, where an ideology was developing which used the event to strengthen its spread through propaganda. The boycott by the United States and politically aligned nations of the 1980 Summer Olympics and the Soviet Union and politically aligned nations of the 1984 Summer Olympics were part of the Cold War conflict.

When apartheid was the official policy in South Africa, many sportspeople adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects. Many African nations boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, as a result of then New Zealand Prime Minister Rob Muldoon allowing the All Blacks to tour South Africa. The issue would later come to a head during the 1981 Springbok Tour.

George Orwell&#x27;s essay &quot;The Sporting Spirit&quot; examines the effect nationalism plays on sport, where Orwell argues that various sporting events trigger violence between groups for the very reason of competition.

== Nationalistic sports ==
In the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were clearly carried on with nationalist overtones: for example, for most of the last century a person could have been banned from playing Gaelic football, hurling, or other sport, if the person was seen to have played Association football, cricket, rugby or any other game which was of British origin.

The nationalistic Italian fascists also created Volata as their own home-grown alternative to football and rugby. It was intended to be a replacement for the popular games perceived to be of British origin that would be of a more local character, tracing its heritage back to the earlier Italian games of Harpastum and Calcio Fiorentino. However, unlike its Gaelic equivalents, Volata was short-lived and is no longer played.

== Clubs as symbols of rival communities ==
In Scotland, the Old Firm derby in Glasgow featuring Celtic, historically linked to the city&#x27;s Catholic community, and Rangers, similarly linked to the city&#x27;s Protestant community, have also historically seen trends along ethno-political lines.

The policy of Spanish football team Athletic Bilbao of picking only Basque players is strongly linked to Basque nationalism. This causes disputes between Athletic Bilbao and other Basque teams due to the Bilbao squad being able to use their economic power to purchase players who play for other important Basque teams who have strong youth ranks, such as CA Osasuna and Real Sociedad. In the same vein, FC Barcelona have since the late 1990s promoted from youth ranks a series of Catalan players such as Xavi and Carles Puyol. Indeed, the club is widely seen as the de facto representative of Catalonia, extending the Autonomous Community&#x27;s reach to areas it otherwise would not be able to influence. However, their local rivals RCD Espanyol usually field more Catalan players than FC Barcelona and the best Catalan goalscorer in La Liga history Raúl Tamudo came through their youth ranks.

In Yugoslavia, NK Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade were seen as symbols of Croatian and Serbian nationalism, respectively. On 13 May 1990, due to the rise of nationalism in the wake of the breakup of the country, an infamous riot broke out between the clubs&#x27; ultras during a league game in Zagreb.

In Canada, the Montreal Canadiens, the world&#x27;s oldest and most successful professional ice hockey team, has always been a symbol for Francophone Quebeckers in Montreal. The teams has had rivalries in succession with the Anglophone Quebec&#x27;s Montreal Wanderers and Montreal Maroons, as well as English Canada&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs. As well, from 1975 to 1995 there was a rivalry with the Quebec Nordiques from Quebec City, which took on political overtones, with Canadiens fans being more likely to be Liberals and federalists, and Nordiques fans more likely Pequists and sovereigntists.

In Indonesia, one of the most successful clubs in Indonesian football Persipura Jayapura is considered to represent Papuan identity and it could be said to be one of the symbols of the campaign and struggle for Papuan independence. In several matches, the flag of the Republic of West Papua, which is considered separatist by the Indonesian government, was flown several times. In fact, one of the players, Edward Junior Wilson, who comes from Liberia, was involved in a fight with the Indonesian police because he thought he was flying the West Papua flag. This happened in the deciding match 2016 Indonesia Soccer Championship A at Mandala Stadium, Jayapura on 18 December 2016. At that time, Persipura, who managed to become champion after beating PSM Makassar 4–2, celebrated their victory after the match. Edward also raised the national flag of Liberia, However, because it was raining at the time, the police mistook the flag he was flying and there was a flag-pulling action with him. After the incident, the police revealed the misunderstanding that had occurred. This incident also sparked a riot between fans and police at the stadium. For some Acehnese, Persiraja Banda Aceh is also considered to represent their Acehnese identity and the Free Aceh Movement. In other cases, Persib Bandung is considered to represent the identity of Sundanese and West Java, especially the Priangan area and by some people it has been considered as their Sundanese culture. By critical people, Persib is analogous to a symbol of resistance to Indonesian centrism which focuses on Jakarta (this is also related to its rivalry with Persija Jakarta). Persib is also considered &quot;the national team of Bandung people&quot;, in fact the level of attendance at the stadium for Persib is higher than for the Indonesia national team when they play in Bandung. Low audience attendance for the Indonesian national team in Bandung this is also the background by sweeping actions and abuse carried out by rival supporters, &quot;The Jakmania&quot; against &quot;Bobotoh&quot; (the name for Persib supporters) when the Indonesian national team played in Jakarta, one of them was the attack on the capo of the Indonesian national team, who was also a &quot;Bobotoh&quot; on 28 October 2018 at Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium by 30–50 &quot;The Jakmania&quot; members. In 2022, a video showed the removal of a banner supporting the Indonesian national team at Sidolig Stadium in Bandung. In the video, the man who carried out the takedown said to the video viewer in Sundanese and English &quot;Eweuh timnas, this is Persib!&quot; (&quot;There is no national team, this is Persib!&quot;). This incident occurred during Indonesian national team training at the stadium.

<text>The history of sports extends back to the Ancient world in 7000 BC. The physical activity that developed into sports had early links with warfare and entertainment.

Study of the history of sport can teach lessons about social changes and about the nature of sport itself, as sport seems involved in the development of basic human skills (compare play). As one delves further back in history, dwindling evidence makes theories of the origins and purposes of sport more and more difficult to support.

As far back as the beginnings of sport, it was related to military training. For example, competition was used as a mean to determine whether individuals were fit and useful for service. Team sports were used to train and to prove the capability to fight in the military and also to work together as a team (military unit).

== Ancient era ==

=== Sports in pre-history ===

Cave paintings found in the Lascaux caves in France appear to depict sprinting and wrestling in the Upper Paleolithic around 15,300 years ago. Cave paintings in the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia dating back to the Neolithic Age () show a wrestling match surrounded by crowds. Neolithic Rock art found at the cave of swimmers in Wadi Sura, near Gilf Kebir in Egypt shows evidence of swimming and archery being practiced around 10,000 BCE. Prehistoric cave paintings in Japan depict a sport similar to sumo wrestling.

=== Ancient Sumer ===

Various representations of wrestlers have been found on stone slabs attributed to the Sumerian civilization. One showing three pairs of wrestlers has been generally dated to around 3000 BC. A cast bronze figurine (perhaps the base of a vase) found at Khafaji in Iraq shows two figures in a wrestling hold and dates to around 2600 BC. Interpreted as one of the earliest depictions of sport, the statue is housed in the National Museum of Iraq. Archeology has also found early suggestions pointing to the sport of boxing in ancient Sumer. The Epic of Gilgamesh gives one of the first historical records of sport, with Gilgamesh engaging in a form of belt wrestling with Enkidu. The cuneiform tablets recording the tale date to around 2000 BC; however, the historical Gilgamesh is supposed to have lived around 2800 to 2600 BC.
The Sumerian king Shulgi ( 21st century BCE) boasts of his prowess in sport in the Self-praise of Shulgi A, B, and C. Fishing hooks not unlike those made today have been found during excavations at Ur, suggesting some sort of angling activity in Sumer around 2600 BC.

=== Ancient Egypt ===

Monuments to the Pharaohs found at Beni Hasan dating to around 2000 BC indicate that a number of sports, including wrestling, weightlifting, long jump, swimming, rowing, archery, fishing and athletics, as well as various kinds of ball games, were well-developed and regulated in Ancient Egypt. Other Egyptian sports also included javelin throwing and high jump. An earlier portrayal of figures wrestling was found in the tomb of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum in Saqqara dating to around 2400 BC.

=== Ancient Greece ===

The Minoan art of Bronze Age Crete depict ritual sporting events - thus a fresco dating to 1500 BC records gymnastics in the form of religious bull-leaping and possibly bullfighting. The origins of Greek sporting festivals may date to funeral games of the Mycenean period, between 1600 BCE and 1100 BC. The &quot;Iliad&quot; includes extensive descriptions of funeral games held in honour of deceased warriors, such as those held for Patroclus by Achilles. Engaging in sport is described as the occupation of the noble and wealthy, who have no need to do manual labour themselves. In the Odyssey, king Odysseus of Ithaca proves his royal status to king Alkinoös of the Phaiakes by showing his proficiency in throwing the javelin. It was in Greece that sports were first instituted formally, with the first Olympic Games recorded in 776 BC in Olympia, where they were celebrated until 393 AD. These games took place every four years, or &quot;Olympiad&quot;, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies. Initially a single sprinting event, the Olympics gradually expanded to include several footraces, run in the nude or in armor, boxing, wrestling, &quot;pankration&quot;, chariot racing, long jump, javelin throw, and discus throw. During the celebration of the games, an Olympic Truce came into effect, allowing athletes to travel from their home polities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were wreaths of laurel leaves. Other important sporting events in ancient Greece included the Isthmian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Pythian Games. Together with the Olympics, these were the most prestigious games, and formed the Panhellenic Games. Some games, e.g. the Panathenaia of Athens, included musical, reading and other non-athletic contests in addition to regular sports-events. The Heraean Games, held in Olympia as early as the 6th century BCE, were the first recorded sporting competition for women.

=== Ancient sports elsewhere ===
Sports that are at least two and a half thousand years old include hurling in Ancient Ireland, shinty in Scotland, harpastum (similar to rugby) in Rome, cuju (similar to association football) in China, and polo in Persia. 

The Mesoamerican ballgame originated over three thousand years ago. The Mayan ballgame of Pitz is believed to be the first ball sport, as it was first played around 2500 BC. There are artifacts and structures that suggest that the Chinese engaged in sporting activities as early as 2000 BCE. Gymnastics appears to have been a popular sport in China&#x27;s ancient past. Ancient Persian sports include the traditional Iranian martial art of Zourkhaneh. Among other sports that originated in Persia are polo and jousting. A polished bone implement found at Eva in Tennessee, United States and dated to around 5000 BC has been construed as a possible sporting device used in a &quot;ring and pin&quot; game. Various traditional sports of India are believed to be thousands of years old, with kho-kho having been played since at least the fourth century BC, aspects of kabaddi having potentially been mentioned in the Mahabharata, and atya-patya having been described in the Naṟṟiṇai, around 300 AD.

==Middle Ages==

For at least 900 years, entire villages had competed with each other in rough, and sometimes violent, ballgames in England (Shrovetide football) and Ireland (caid). In comparison, the game of calcio Fiorentino, in Florence, Italy, was originally reserved for combat sports such as fencing and jousting being popular. Horse racing, in particular, was a favourite of the upper class in Great Britain, with Queen Anne founding the Ascot Racecourse.

Long summer days provided predictable opportunities for free time, when peasants could engage in athletic activities. Swimming, wrestling, and racing were common among all ages and both genders, while organized ball games of various types can be found in every medieval society and culture. The participation of sports (ball games to be exact) at the time loosened control the ruling class had over the peasants; this is not a rare trend throughout history. By the fourteenth century no fewer than thirty bans have been placed by English kings on ball games such as football, handball, and hurling.

The Middle Ages were not immediately devoid of sports from the Roman Empire after it collapsed. Gladiatorial bouts and chariot racing continued sporadically and intermittently well into the Middle Ages. They would eventually fade away and be replaced by local activities. Hawking, however, was the particular reserve of emperors and kings. This sport would be one of the few sports continued in the Middle Ages; Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor may have played a critical role in its persistence as he was an avid hawker who authored the first comprehensive book on falconry. Furthermore, kings may have followed the example of falconry as to mimic the status of an emperor.

During the Middle Ages, tournaments were not an uncommon occurrence; after all, war was a constant threat that could occur often. Thus, preparation (for war) is practice, practice is competition, and competition is sport; consequently, (before the establishment of sports history), the medieval hallmarks of upper-class sports (i.e. jousting, mock combat, and blood sports) were generally agreed upon as military training. Modern sports historians, however, debate that such sports were for entertainment purposes; one example considered were tournaments which offered little to prepare one for actual war and would likely have set any forms of real training back. Tournaments in the Middle Ages arose out of local festivals. As a result, many tournaments had their own local characteristic but were uniform in habits and customs of the region the tournament was stationed in. 

Medieval tournaments presents characteristics of modern sport as those (ex: professional knights) who were most successful and popular, perhaps the only medieval equivalent to today&#x27;s sports stars, followed the money and fame of the tournament circuit. Those with political backing and social favor were able to accumulate property and goods to ensure a comfortable life after their competitive days were over. The tournament was a market and a social mixer. These tournaments consequently attracted many people to attend for various purposes such as marriages, and trade of livestock and land or wares provided by merchants and vendors. 

Sébastien Nadot writes that sport already existed in the 15th century. He shows that the organization of the chivalry around European contests worked like a system in an elaborate network. He evokes an &quot;chivalrous international&quot;, sharing the same codes, especially at tournaments and games. These sporting events went beyond borders and were accompanied by a common cultural base, including courtesy, fair play, honor, and loyalty.
The Middle Ages also revealed the importance of owning a horse; common to the sports and amusements of the ruling class was the horse. If someone of the ruling class did not own a horse, it would represent that they did not have much wealth and leisure (since they would be unable to participate in certain activities like horse racing).

==Renaissance==
After the late middle ages, early modern sports became less of a violent or military training activity and more of an activity done for recreational benefit in Europe. During the Renaissance, educators, and medical surgeons promoted playing sports because of their numerous physical and psychological benefits to the human body. During this era, there was also support for moderating sports, as it was viewed as more for leisure than a strict procedure. Open-air sporting events became an attraction for many and people of all different social hierarchies were involved in this new culture. These new radical ideas about sports made their way into books, and films, and eventually became part of the social culture during the Renaissance. As mentioned by Mike Huggins, &quot;Gargantua&quot; written by François Rabelais was a well-known novel published in 1534 that mentioned sports and games as a unit, like many other renowned works of literature. All different types of sports became a functional unit in many people&#x27;s routines and it brought refreshment into people&#x27;s lives. As the popularity and involvement of sports increased, rules began to form and sports became more regulated so they could be fair. Sports clubs and associations which provided a sense of unity also became more common, especially for elite sports such as horse racing, cockfighting, hunting, and tennis during the sixteenth and seventeenth-centuries. For example, Charles II formed 20 rules for horse racing in 1665. Sports were a form of entertainment for spectators who did not play themselves. There were stake-money contests and prizes in these sports and racing competitions. These modern advancements and developments made about sporting life in the Renaissance in Europe eventually made their way to Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

==Development of modern sports==

Some historians – most notably Bernard Lewis – claim that team sports as we know them today are primarily an invention of Western culture. British Prime Minister John Major was more explicit in 1995:
:We invented the majority of the world&#x27;s great sports... 19th century Britain was the cradle of a leisure revolution every bit as significant as the agricultural and industrial revolutions we launched in the century before.

The traditional team sports are seen as springing primarily from Britain, and subsequently exported across the vast British Empire. European colonialism helped spread particular games around the world, especially cricket (not directly related to baseball), football of various sorts, bowling in a number of forms, cue sports (like snooker, carom billiards, and pool), hockey and its derivatives, equestrian, tennis, and many winter sports. The originally European-dominated modern Olympic Games generally also ensured standardization in particularly European, especially British, directions when rules for similar games around the world were merged.

Regardless of game origins, the Industrial Revolution and mass production brought increased leisure which allowed more time to engage in playing or observing (and gambling upon) spectator sports, as well as less elitism in and greater accessibility of sports of many kinds. With the advent of mass media and global communication, professionalism became prevalent in sports, and this furthered sports popularity in general.

With the increasing values placed on those who won also came the increased desire to cheat. Some of the most common ways of cheating today involve the use of performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids. The use of these drugs has always been frowned on but in recent history there have also been agencies set up to monitor professional athletes and ensure fair play in the sport.

===England===
Writing about cricket in particular, John Leech has explained the role of Puritan power, the English Civil War, and the Restoration of the monarchy in England. The Long Parliament in 1642 &quot;banned theatres, which had met with Puritan disapproval. Although similar action would be taken against certain sports, it is not clear if cricket was in any way prohibited, except that players must not &quot;break the Sabbath&quot;&quot;. In 1660, &quot;the Restoration of the monarchy in England was immediately followed by the reopening of the theaters and so any sanctions that had been imposed by the Puritans on cricket would also have been lifted.&quot; He goes on to make the key point that political, social and economic conditions in the aftermath of the Restoration encouraged excessive gambling, so much so that a Gambling Act was deemed necessary in 1664. It is certain that cricket, horse racing and boxing (i.e., prizefighting) were financed by gambling interests. Leech explains that it was the habit of cricket patrons, all of whom were gamblers, to form strong teams through the 18th century to represent their interests. He defines a strong team as one representative of more than one parish and he is certain that such teams were first assembled in or immediately after 1660. Prior to the English Civil War and the Commonwealth, all available evidence concludes that cricket had evolved to the level of village cricket only where teams that are strictly representative of individual parishes compete. The &quot;strong teams&quot; of the post-restoration mark the evolution of cricket (and, indeed of professional team sport, for cricket is the oldest professional team sport) from the parish standard to the county standard. This was the point of origin for major, or first-class, cricket. The year 1660 also marks the origin of professional team sport. All-England cricket teams have played since 1739.

A number of the public schools such as Winchester and Eton, introduced variants of football and other sports for their pupils. These were described at the time as &quot;innocent and lawful&quot;, certainly in comparison with the rougher rural games. With urbanization in the 19th century, the rural games moved to the new urban centres and came under the influence of the middle and upper classes. The rules and regulations devised at English institutions began to be applied to the wider game, with governing bodies in England being set up for a number of sports by the end of the 19th century. The rising influence of the upper class also produced an emphasis on the amateur, and the spirit of &quot;fair play&quot;. The industrial revolution also brought with it increasing mobility, and created the opportunity for universities in Britain and elsewhere to compete with one another. This sparked increasing attempts to unify and reconcile various games in England, leading to the establishment of the Football Association in London, the first official governing body in football.

For sports to become professionalized, coaching had to come first. It gradually professionalized in the Victorian Era and the role was well established by 1914. In the First World War, military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale-building teams. Sport became an important part of military life for British servicemen serving around the world.

===The British Empire and post-colonial sports===
The influence of British sports and their codified rules began to spread across the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly association football. A number of major teams elsewhere in the world still show these British origins in their names, such as A.C. Milan in Italy, Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense in Brazil, and Athletic Bilbao in Spain. Cricket became popular in several of the nations of the then British Empire, such as Australia, South Africa, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, and remain popular in and beyond today&#x27;s Commonwealth of Nations. The revival of the Olympic Games by Baron Pierre de Coubertin was also heavily influenced by the amateur ethos of the English public schools. The British played a major role in defining amateurism, professionalism, the tournament system and the concept of fair play. Some sports developed in England, spread to other countries and then lost its popularity in England while remaining actively played in other countries, a notable example being bandy which remains popular in Finland, Kazakhstan, Norway, Russia, and Sweden.

European morals and views on empires were embedded in the structure of sports. Ideas of &quot;social discipline&quot; and &quot;loyalty&quot; were key factors in European empire ettiequte, which eventually transferred into sports ettiequte. Also ideas of &quot;patient and methodical training&quot;, were enforced to make soldiers stronger, and athletes better. Diffusion helped with the process of connecting these two concepts and has helped shaped the values of sports as we know it today. Sports like baseball, football (soccer), and cricket all came from European influence, and all share the same values based on European empires. 

Baseball (closely related to English rounders and French la soule, and less clearly connected to cricket) became established in the urban Northeastern United States, with the first rules being codified in the 1840s, while American football was very popular in the south-east, with baseball spreading to the south, and American football spreading to the north after the Civil War. There is documented evidence of baseball in England. An extract from an 18th-century diary containing the oldest known reference to baseball is among the items on display in a new exhibition in London exploring the English origins and cricketing connections of America&#x27;s national sport.

While baseball was once claimed to have been invented in the U.S. in the mid-19th century, recent findings suggest a sport of the same name may have evolved decades earlier alongside cricket, crossing the Atlantic with English settlers to the American colonies. One notable discovery found in a shed in a village in Surrey, southern England, in 2008 was a handwritten 18th-century diary belonging to a local lawyer, William Bray. &quot;Went to Stoke church this morn.,&quot; wrote Bray on Easter Monday in 1755. &quot;After dinner, went to Miss Jeale&#x27;s to play at base ball with her the 3 Miss Whiteheads, Miss Billinghurst, Miss Molly Flutter, Mr. Chandler, Mr. Ford and H. Parsons. Drank tea and stayed til 8.&quot; In the 1870s the game split between the professionals and amateurs; the professional game rapidly gained dominance, and marked a shift in the focus from the player to the club. The rise of baseball also helped squeeze out other sports such as cricket, which had been popular in Philadelphia prior to the rise of baseball.

American football (and gridiron football more generally) also has its origins in the English variants of the game, with the first set of intercollegiate football rules based directly on the rules of the Football Association in London. However, Harvard chose to play a game based on the rules of Rugby football. Walter Camp would then heavily modify this variant in the 1880s, with the modifications also heavily influencing the rules of Canadian football.
Worldwide, the British influence includes many different football codes, lawn bowls, lawn tennis and other sports. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world&#x27;s first lawn mower in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.

===United States===
Most sports in the United States evolved out of European practices. However, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, water skiing, and snowboarding are North American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. However, Lacrosse and surfing in particular arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.

=== Around the world ===

The 21st century has seen a move towards adventure sports as a form of individual escapism, transcending the routines of life. Examples include white water rafting, paragliding, canyoning, base jumping, and orienteering.

Shorter formats have been invented for various sports, such as T20 cricket and 3x3 basketball. The Youth Olympic Games has helped in globalizing some of these formats, such as 3x3 and hockey5s. Urban sports in general have become prioritized to a greater extent for inclusion in the Olympic Games, due to their ability to appeal to youth and generate digital engagement. Traditional non-Western sports, which had been diminished by Western dominance in earlier centuries, have also become newly popularized and standardized.

==Women&#x27;s sport history==

Women&#x27;s competition in sports has been frowned upon by many societies in the past. The English public-school background of organized sport in the 19th and early 20th century led to a paternalism that tended to discourage women&#x27;s involvement in sports, with, for example, no women officially competing in the 1896 Olympic Games. The 20th century saw major advances in the participation of women in sports due to a growing women&#x27;s sports movement in Europe and North America. This led to the initiation of the Women&#x27;s Olympiad (held three times 1921, 1922 and 1923) and the Women&#x27;s World Games (held four times (1922, 1926, 1930 and 1934. In 1924 the 1924 Women&#x27;s Olympiad was held in London. The increase in girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s participation in sport has been partly influenced by the women&#x27;s rights and feminist movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, respectively. In the United States, female student participation in sports was significantly boosted by the Title IX Act in 1972, which forbade gender discrimination in all aspects of any educational environment that uses federal financial aid, leading to increased funding and support to develop female athletes.

Pressure from sports funding bodies has also improved gender equality in sports. For example, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the Leander Club (for rowing) in England had both been male-only establishments since their founding in 1787 and 1818, respectively, but both opened their doors to female members at the end of the 20th century at least partially due to the requirements of the United Kingdom Lottery Sports Fund.

The 21st century has seen women&#x27;s participation in sport at its all-time highest. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, women competed in 27 sports over 137 events, compared to 28 men&#x27;s sports in 175 events. Several national women&#x27;s professional sports leagues have been founded and are in competition, and women&#x27;s international sporting events such as the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup, and Women&#x27;s Hockey World Cup continue to grow.

<doc id="398319" wikidata="Q1053703" url="?curid=398319" title="Hōki Province">
<text>was a former province in the area that is today the western half of Tottori Prefecture in the San&#x27;in region of Japan. Hōki was bordered by Inaba, Mimasaka, Izumo, Bitchū, and Bingo Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Hōki was one of the provinces of the San&#x27;indo circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Hōki was ranked as one of the 35 &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;middle countries&quot; (中国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital was located in what is now the city of Kurayoshi, Tottori. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Shitori Shrine also located in the town of Yurihama. As there are many cultural and historic similarities between Hōki and neighboring Izumo Provinces, the two provinces are sometimes informally grouped together as the . Conversely, Mount Daisen forms a geographic divide, which separates Hōki culturally and historically into eastern and regions. 

==History==
From before the Kofun period, the area of Hōki was part of the Izumo cultural area, including the production of iron and the forging of swords. According to the &quot;Hōki &quot;Fudoki&quot;&quot;, the hydra monster Yamata no Orochi pursued Princess Inada into the mountains of Hōki, where she called out for her mother to save her. Her cries of &quot;Hahakimase&quot; became shortened to &quot;hahaki&quot; and eventually &quot;Hōki&quot;. The ancient &quot;Kojiki&quot; states that the burial place of the creator &quot;kami&quot;, Izanami was located on the border of Izumo with Hōki. During the late Kofun period to Asuka period, Hōki was gradually incorporated into Yamato rule. At the end of the Kamakura period, exiled Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from his prison on the Oki Islands and made Hōki his initial base of operations against the Kamakura shogunate. During the Muromachi period, the Yamana clan were nominally &quot;shugo&quot; of the province; however, their control over the province was very weak, and local warlords and aggressive neighbors often usurped Yamana authority. In the Sengoku period, the province was a contested area between the Amago clan. Mōri clan and Oda Nobunaga, with Nobunaga&#x27;s general, Hashiba Hideyoshi eventually seizing control. In the Edo period, the entire province was ruled by a branch of the Ikeda clan as part of the 320,000 &quot;koku&quot; Tottori Domain centered on Tottori Castle in neighboring Inaba Province, although the important temple and pilgrimage center of Daisen-ji remained independent. 

Following the Meiji restoration and the abolition of the han system in 1871, Hōki became part of Tottori Prefecture on August 29,1871. However, Tottori was merged into Shimane Prefecture on August 21, 1876. It was separated back out on September 12, 1881. However, the name of province continued to exist for some time afterwards for legal purposes. For example, Hōki is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation’s resources, the province had 778 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 245,034 &quot;koku&quot;.

<doc id="398336" wikidata="Q1346006" url="?curid=398336" title="List of international sports federations">
<text>This is a list of international sports federations, each of which serves as a non-governmental governing body for a given sport and administers its sport at a world level, most often crafting rules, promoting the sport to prospective spectators and fans, developing prospective players, and organizing world or continental championships. Some international sports federations, such as World Aquatics and the International Skating Union, may oversee multiple activities referred to in common parlance as separate sports: World Aquatics, for example governs swimming, diving, synchronised swimming, and water polo as separate &quot;disciplines&quot; within the single &quot;sport&quot; of Aquatics.

International sports federations form an integral part of the Olympic and Paralympic movements. Each Olympic sport is represented by its respective international sports federation, which in turn helps administer the events in its respective sport during the Games. For a sport to become an Olympic sport, its international sports federation must be recognized by the International Olympic Committee.

Likewise, an international sports federation must be recognized by the International Paralympic Committee for its sport to become a paralympic sport, though in the latter case, several Paralympic Sports are governed by a dedicated committee of the International Paralympic Committee itself, under the &quot;World Para&quot; branding, for example track and field athletics for disabled athletes is governed by the IPC itself, under the name &quot;World Para Athletics&quot;. Other Paralympic sports are governed within the structure of the able-bodied equivalent: for example, the UCI governs both able-bodied and paralympic cycling.

== Federations recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ==

===Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF)===
In May 2023 the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) reached a number of 31 full member international federations and 2 associate member international federations.

However, on 22 June 2023, the IOC decided to withdraw recognition of the International Boxing Association (IBA), in accordance with Rule 3.7 of the Olympic Charter (OC), although boxing will continue to be an olympic sport for the 2028 Summer Olympics. This was the first-ever International Federation to be removed from the Olympic Movement by the IOC.

The following are the 30 members of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) which are recognised by the International Olympic Committee:


==== ASOIF associate members ====
The following are the 2 current Associate Member International Federations of ASOIF. 
===Association of International Olympic Winter Sports Federations (AIOWF)===
The following are recognized by the Association of International Olympic Winter Sports Federations (AIOWF):
The following is an Associate Member International Federation of AIOWF (representing a sport which is on the Olympic Programme of Milan-Cortina 2026).
===Association of the IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF)===
As of April 2024 the Association of the IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF) has 39 member federations. 
The following are recognised by the Association of the IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF):

==Federations recognized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC)==
There are 17 international federations recognized by the IPC, while the IPC itself serves as the international federation for six sports. IPC recognises also 4 International Organisations of Sports for the Disabled. And there are another 14 federations which are recognised by the IPC but are not eligible to be IPC members.

=== Sports directly governed by IPC ===
On 30 November 2016, the IPC adopted the &quot;World Para&quot; brand for all 10 of the sports that it directly governed at that time. At the 2021 IPC General Assembly, IPC members provided a strong mandate for the IPC to cease acting as the international federation for 10 sports by the end of 2026. Para alpine skiing, Para cross-country, Para snowboard and Para biathlon have been already transferred to FIS and IBU. Currently IPC acts as the international federation for six sports:
=== International Federations ===
International Federations are independent sport federations recognised by the IPC as the sole representative of a Paralympic Sport. As of 2024, the IPC recognises 17 International Federations representing 19 parasports:
=== International Organisations of Sports for the Disabled ===
:International Organisations of Sports for the Disabled (IOSDs) are independent organisations recognised by the IPC as the sole representatives of a specific impairment group.
:The IPC currently recognises 3 IOSDs: 

Following two years of talks, and relevant decisions by both their General Assemblies, on 1 January 2023, the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CPISRA) and the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS) were merged to form World Abilitysport.

=== IPC-recognised International sports federations non-eligible for membership ===
The IPC recognises a number of international sports federations which are not eligible to be IPC members, but contribute to the development of sport opportunities for athletes associated with the Paralympic Movement and have organisational goals that are compatible with the Vision and Mission of the IPC.

The following 14 are IPC-recognised international sport federations:
==SportAccord==
Federations whose sports are either included in the Olympic Games (ASOIF, AIOWF) or recognized by the IOC (ARISF) are also stakeholders of SportAccord, after the dissolution of the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) in 2023. Other stakeholders of SportAccord (non-IOC recognized) compose the Alliance of Independent Recognised Members of Sport (AIMS).

=== Alliance of Independent Recognized Members of Sport (AIMS) ===

=== Associate members of GAISF ===
Before the dissolution of GAISF in 2023, other than full members (composing ASOIF, AIOWF, ARISF and AIMS), there have been Associate members of GAISF. After the dissolution of GAISF, the proposal has been for its former associate members to be granted observer status at the SportAccord General Assembly.

=== Observers of GAISF ===
Before the dissolution of GAISF in 2023, the GAISF Observer Status could be requested by the Applicants to GAISF Membership interested to obtain support and guidance in their path to fulfil the GAISF Membership Criteria.

<doc id="398338" wikidata="Q463275" url="?curid=398338" title="Gracie Fields">
<text>Dame Gracie Fields (born Grace Stansfield; 9 January 189827 September 1979) was a British actress, singer and comedian. A star of cinema and music hall, she was one of the top ten film stars in Britain during the 1930s and was considered the highest paid film star in the world in 1937. Fields was known affectionately as &quot;Our Gracie&quot; and &quot;the Lancashire Lass&quot; and for never losing her strong, native Lancashire accent. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and an Officer of the Venerable Order of St John (OStJ) in 1938, and a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1979.

==Life and work==
===Early life===
Fields was born Grace Stansfield, a daughter of Frederick Stansfield (1874–1956) and his wife Sarah Jane &#x27;Jenny&#x27; Stansfield née Bamford (1879–1953), over a fish and chip shop owned by her grandmother, Sarah Bamford, in Molesworth Street, Rochdale, Lancashire. Her great-grandfather, William Stansfield (b.1805), of Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, was a descendant of the Stansfield family of Stansfield, Yorkshire.

Fields made her first stage appearance as a child, in 1905, joining children&#x27;s repertory theatre groups such as &quot;Haley&#x27;s Garden of Girls&quot; and Clara Coverdale&#x27;s &quot;Nine Dainty Dots&quot;. Her two sisters, Edith Fields and Betty Fields, and brother, Tommy Fields, all went on to appear on stage, but Gracie was the most successful. Her professional debut in variety took place at the Rochdale Hippodrome theatre in 1910, and she soon gave up her job in the local cotton mill, where she was a half-timer, spending half a week in the mill and the other half at school. Early newspaper clippings show her appearing locally in venues such as Todmorden (December 1913), Milnrow (February 1914), and Burnley (July 1914), with an appearance at The Palace in Blackpool in April 1914. The Burnley newspaper described her as “The Girl with the Double Voice”.

Fields met the comedian and impresario Archie Pitt and they began working together in Percy Hall&#x27;s touring show &quot;Yes, I Think So.&quot; Pitt gave Fields champagne on her 18th birthday, and wrote in an autograph book to her that he would make her a star. Pitt began to manage her career and they began a relationship; they married in 1923 at Clapham Register Office. Their first revue together, written by Pitt, was called &quot;It&#x27;s A Bargain!&quot; in 1915, and the two continued to tour Britain together until 1931. 

Throughout 1918-1924, they appeared in the revue &quot;Mr Tower of London&quot;, which took Fields to the West End for the first time. Other shows following with Pitt in subsequent years, were &quot;The Show&#x27;s The Thing&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way.&quot; 

Pitt was the brother of Bert Aza, founder of the Aza Agency, which was responsible for many entertainers of the day including the actor and comedian Stanley Holloway, who was introduced to Aza by Fields, and Betty Driver who was discovered by Archie was a replacement cast member in &#x27;Mr Tower of London&#x27;. Fields and Holloway first worked together on her film &quot;Sing As We Go&quot; in 1934 and the two remained close friends for the rest of their lives.

===Fame===

Fields came to major public notice in &quot;Mr Tower of London&quot;, a show staged in London&#x27;s West End. Her career accelerated from this point, with dramatic performances and the beginning of a recording career with the His Master&#x27;s Voice. She was one of the most successful recording artists at the label, her first record, &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; sold 500,000 copies in 1928. In 1933, His Master&#x27;s Voice produced the four millionth Fields record, which was pressed by the singer herself on camera and celebrated with a special &#x27;Lancashire Lunch&#x27; at the Trocadero .

At one point, Fields was playing three shows a night in the West End. She appeared in the production &quot;SOS&quot; with Gerald Du Maurier, a play staged at the St James&#x27;s Theatre.

Fields&#x27; most famous song, &quot;Sally&quot;, which became her theme, was written for her first film, &quot;Sally in Our Alley&quot; (1931), a major box office hit. She went on to make a number of films, initially in Britain and later in the United States (when she was paid a record fee of £200,000 for four films). Regardless, she never enjoyed performing without a live audience, and found the process of film-making boring. She tried to opt out of filming, before director Monty Banks persuaded her otherwise, landing her a lucrative Hollywood deal. Fields demanded that the four pictures be filmed in Britain and not Hollywood.

The final few lines of the song &quot;Sally&quot;, which Fields sang at every performance from 1931 onwards, were written by her husband&#x27;s mistress, Annie Lipman. Fields claimed in later life that she wanted to &quot;Drown blasted Sally with Walter with the aspidistra on top!&quot;, a reference to two other of her well-known songs, &quot;Walter, Walter&quot;, and &quot;The Biggest Aspidistra In The World&quot;.

The famous opera star Luisa Tetrazzini heard her singing an aria and asked her to sing in grand opera. Fields decided to stay &quot;where I knew I belonged.&quot;

===Charity work===
In the 1930s, her popularity was at its peak, and she was given many honours: she became an Officer of the Venerable Order of St John (OStJ) for her charity work, and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for her services to entertainment in the 1938 New Year Honours, and was granted the Freedom of the Borough of Rochdale in 1937.

She donated her house in The Bishops Avenue, north London – which she had not much cared for, and shared with her husband Pitt and his mistress – to an orphanage after the marriage broke down. In 1939, she became seriously ill with cervical cancer. The public sent over 250,000 goodwill messages and she retired to her villa on Capri. After she recovered, she recorded a special 78 rpm record simply called &quot;Gracie&#x27;s Thanks&quot;, in which she thanks the public for the many cards and letters she received while in hospital.

Fields also helped Rochdale Association Football Club in the 1930s, when they were struggling to pay fees and buy sports equipment.

In 1933, she set up the Gracie Fields Children&#x27;s Home and Orphanage at Peacehaven, Sussex, for children of those in the theatre profession who could not look after their children. She kept this until 1967, when the home was no longer needed. This was near her own home in Peacehaven, and Fields often visited, with the children all calling her &#x27;Aunty Grace&#x27;.

===World War II===
In 1939, Fields suffered a breakdown and went to Capri to recuperate.
World War II was declared while she was recovering in Capri, and Fields – still very ill after her cancer surgery – threw herself into her work and signed up for the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) headed by her old film producer, Basil Dean. Fields travelled to France to entertain the troops in the midst of air-raids, performing on the backs of open lorries and in war-torn areas. During the war, she also paid for all servicemen and women to travel free on public transport within the boundaries of Rochdale. Fields travelled to Chester with serviceman Harrison after he had watched her perform in France. She stayed with his family of 9 as a guest in their small 2 up 2 down house.

Following her divorce from Archie Pitt, she married Italian-born film director Monty Banks in March 1940. However, because Banks remained an Italian citizen and would have been interned in the United Kingdom after Italy declared war in 1940, she went with him to North America, possibly at the suggestion of Winston Churchill who told her to &quot;Make American Dollars, not British Pounds&quot;, which she did, in aid of the Navy League and the Spitfire Fund. She and Banks moved to their home in Santa Monica, California. Fields occasionally returned to Britain, performing in factories and army camps around the country. After their initial argument, Parliament offered her an official apology.

Although she continued to spend much of her time entertaining troops and otherwise supporting the war effort outside Britain, this led to a decline in her popularity at home. She performed many times for Allied troops, travelling as far as New Guinea, where she received an enthusiastic response from Australian personnel. In late 1945, she toured the South Pacific Islands.

===Post-war career===
After the war, Fields continued her career less actively. She began performing in Britain again in 1948, headlining the London Palladium over Ella Fitzgerald who was also on the bill. The BBC gave her her own weekly radio show in 1947, dubbed &quot;Our Gracie&#x27;s Working Party&quot;, in which 12 towns were visited by Fields. A live show of music and entertainment, it was compèred by Fields, who also performed, together with local talents. The tour commenced in Gracie&#x27;s hometown of Rochdale. Like many BBC shows at the time, this show transferred to Radio Luxembourg in 1950, where it was sponsored by Wisk soap powder. Billy Ternent and his Orchestra accompanied her.

In 1951, Fields took part in the cabaret which closed the Festival of Britain celebrations. She proved popular once more, though never regaining the status she enjoyed in the 1930s. She continued recording, but made no more films, moving more towards light classical music as popular tastes changed, often adopting a religious theme. She continued into the new medium of LP records, and recorded new versions of her old favourite songs, as well as contemporary tracks, to &#x27;liven things up a bit&#x27;.

Her husband, Monty Banks, died on 8 January 1950 of a heart attack, while travelling on the Orient Express. On 18 February 1952 in Capri, Fields married Boris Alperovici (d.1983), a Romanian radio repairman. She claimed that he was the love of her life, and that she couldn&#x27;t wait to propose to him. She proposed on Christmas Day in front of friends and family. They married at the Church of St Stefano on Capri in a quiet ceremony, before honeymooning in Rome.

She lived on her beloved Isle of Capri for the remainder of her life, at her home &quot;La Canzone Del Mare&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Sea&quot;), where her home overlooked the swimming and restaurant complex. It was favoured by many Hollywood stars during the 1950s, with regular guests including Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Greta Garbo and Noël Coward.

===Later years===
Fields began to work less, but still toured the UK under the management of Harold Fielding (manager of top artists of the day such as Tommy Steele and Max Bygraves). Her UK tours proved popular, and in the mid-1960s she gave farewell tours in Australia, Canada and America; the last performance was recorded and released years later.

In 1956, Fields was the first actress to portray Miss Marple on screen, in a US Television (Goodyear Playhouse) production of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;A Murder is Announced&quot;. The production featured Jessica Tandy and Roger Moore, and predates the Margaret Rutherford films by five years. She also starred in Television productions of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (DuPont Show of the Month, 1958), &quot;The Old Lady Shows Her Medals&quot; (United States Steel Hour)– for which she won a Sylvania Award (1956) and received an EMMY Award nomination for Best Single Performance by an Actress (1957) – and &quot;Mrs &#x27;Arris Goes to Paris&quot; (Studio One), which was remade years later with Angela Lansbury as Mrs Harris, a charwoman in search of a fur coat (or a Christian Dior gown in Lansbury&#x27;s case).

In 1957, her single &quot;Around the World&quot; peaked at No.8 in the UK Singles Chart, with her recording of &quot;Little Donkey&quot; reaching No.20 in November 1959. The sheet music for the song was the UK&#x27;s best-seller for seven weeks.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 20 March 1960, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

Fields regularly performed in TV appearances, being the first entertainer to perform on Val Parnell&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. Fields had two Christmas TV specials in 1960 and 1961, singing her old favourites and new songs in front of a studio audience. 1971 saw &quot;A Gift For Gracie&quot;, another TV special presented by Fields and Bruce Forsyth. This followed on from her popularity on &quot;Stars on Sunday&quot;, a religious programme on Britain&#x27;s ITV, in which well-known performers sang hymns or read extracts from the Bible. Fields was the most requested artist on the show.

In 1968, Fields headlined a two-week Christmas stint at the West Riding of Yorkshire&#x27;s prestigious Batley Variety Club. &quot;I was born over a fish and chip shop – I never thought I&#x27;d be singing in one!&quot; claimed Fields during the performance recorded by the BBC.

Fields recorded an album &quot;Stars on Sunday&quot; which was released on York BYK 707 in 1971. It included the songs, &quot;Three Green Bonnets&quot;, &quot;Forgive Me Lord&quot;, &quot;Round the Bend of the Road&quot;, &quot;Ave Maria&quot; and &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;.

In 1975, her album &quot;The Golden Years&quot; reached No. 48 in the UK Albums Chart.

In 1978, she opened the Gracie Fields Theatre, near Oulder Hill Leadership Academy in her native Rochdale, performing a concert there recorded by the BBC to open the show. Fields appeared in ten Royal Variety Performances from 1928 onwards, her last being in 1978 at the age of 80, when she appeared as a surprise guest in the finale and sang her theme song, &quot;Sally&quot;.

Her final TV appearance came in January 1979 when she appeared in a special octogenarian edition of &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; in America, in which she sang the song she popularised in America, &quot;The Biggest Aspidistra in the World&quot;. Fields was notified by her confidant John Taylor, while she was in America, that she had received the Queen&#x27;s invitation to become a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (in the 1979 New Years Honours List), to which she replied: &quot;Yes I&#x27;ll accept, yes I can kneel – but I might need help getting back up, and yes I&#x27;ll attend – as long as they don&#x27;t call Boris &#x27;Buttons&#x27;.&quot; Seven months before her death in 1979, she was invested as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II.

===Death===
Fields&#x27;s health declined in July 1979, when she contracted pneumonia after performing an open-air concert on the Royal Yacht, which was docked in Capri&#x27;s harbour. After a spell in hospital, she seemed to be recovering, but died on 27 September 1979, aged 81. The press reported she died holding her husband&#x27;s hand, but in reality he was at their Anacapri home at the time, while Gracie was home with the housekeeper, Irena. She was buried in Capri&#x27;s Protestant Cemetery, in a white marble tomb. Her coffin was carried by staff from her restaurant.

==Honours and popular culture==
Honours

Fields was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1938 New Years Honours. In February 1979, she was invested as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire seven months before her death at her home on Capri, aged 81.

Popular culture

Fields was the mystery guest on the 1 May 1955 edition of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; After Bennett Cerf asked about one of her songs, Dorothy Kilgallen correctly guessed it was her. Fields was granted the Freedom of Rochdale. 

In early 1985, an episode of the BBC television series &quot;Halls of Fame,&quot; which presented a nostalgic look at various famous regional theatres, included a medley of Fields&#x27; songs at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, sung by Marti Webb. At the 1985 Royal Variety Performance, Su Pollard performed &quot;Sally&quot; in tribute to her. The following year&#x27;s Performance also featured a section with a medley of Fields&#x27; songs, again sung by Webb.

Following her death, she was referenced in the 1987 film &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, the 1996 film &quot;Intimate Relations&quot;, and the 2006 film &quot;The History Boys&quot;.

&quot;Gracie!&quot; was a 2009 biopic TV film on her life, with Jane Horrocks playing Fields and Tom Hollander her husband Monty Banks. It covers her career before the Second World War and the decline in her popularity during the war.

Other Honours

Fields had two ships named after her. On 8 April 1936, Fields herself launched the PS &quot;Gracie Fields&quot; which was the last paddle steamer built for Red Funnel as a ferry and excursion steamer. She ran on the Southampton-Cowes route until the outbreak of World War II, when she was requisitioned and served as a minesweeper as HMS &quot;Gracie Fields.&quot; She was seriously damaged by aircraft bomb during the evacuation of Dunkirk and sank in 1940. In 1936, a passenger ship was also named the &quot;Gracie Fields&quot;.

Three oil paintings of Fields are held by Touchstones Gallery, Rochdale: in 1938, a painting by Herbert James Gunn, in 1978, a painting by William Allan Vause, and in 1998, a painting by Keith John Turley.

The local theatre in Rochdale, the Gracie Fields Theatre, was opened by, and named after, her in 1978.

On 3 October 2009, the final train to run on the Oldham Loop before it closed to be converted to a Manchester Metrolink tramway, a Class 156, was named in her honour. 

In September 2016, a statue of Fields, created by Sean Hedges-Quinn, was unveiled outside Rochdale Town Hall, which was the first statue of a woman to be erected for over a century in Lancashire.

<text>The Am386 CPU is a 100%-compatible clone of the Intel 80386 design released by AMD in March 1991. It sold millions of units, positioning AMD as a legitimate competitor to Intel, rather than being merely a second source for &quot;x86&quot; CPUs (then termed &quot;8086-family&quot;).

==History and design==
While the AM386 CPU was essentially ready to be released prior to 1991, Intel kept it tied up in court. Intel learned of the Am386 when both companies hired employees with the same name who coincidentally stayed at the same hotel, which accidentally forwarded a package for AMD to Intel&#x27;s employee. AMD had previously been a second-source manufacturer of Intel&#x27;s Intel 8086, Intel 80186 and Intel 80286 designs, and AMD&#x27;s interpretation of the contract, made up in 1982, was that it covered all derivatives of them. Intel, however, claimed that the contract only covered the 80286 and prior processors and forbade AMD the right to manufacture 80386 CPUs in 1987. After a few years in the courtrooms, AMD finally won the case and the right to sell their Am386 in March 1991. This also paved the way for competition in the 80386-compatible 32-bit CPU market and so lowered the cost of owning a PC.

While Intel&#x27;s 386 CPUs had topped out at 33 MHz in 1989, AMD introduced 40 MHz versions of both its 386DX and 386SX out of the gate, extending the lifespan of the architecture. In the following two years the AMD 386DX-40 saw popularity with small manufacturers of PC clones and with budget-minded computer enthusiasts because it offered near-80486 performance at a much lower price than an actual 486. Generally the 386DX-40 performs nearly on par with a 25 MHz 486 due to the 486 needing fewer clock cycles per instruction, thanks to its tighter pipelining (more overlapping of internal processing) in combination with an on-chip CPU cache. However, its 32-bit 40 MHz data bus gave the 386DX-40 comparatively good memory and I/O performance.

===Am386DX data===
* 32-bit data bus, can select between either a 32-bit bus or a 16-bit bus by use of the BS16 input
* 32-bit physical address space, 4 Gbyte physical memory address space
* fetches code in four-byte units
* released in March 1991 (October 1991 for DXLV/SXLV variants with SMM)

===Am386DE data===
* 32-bit data bus, can select between either a 32-bit bus or a 16-bit bus by use of the BS16 input
* 32-bit physical address space, 4 Gbyte physical memory address space
* fetches code in four-byte units
* no paging unit

==AM386 SX==
In 1991 AMD also introduced advanced versions of the 386SX processor – again not as a second source production of the Intel chip, but as a reverse engineered pin compatible version. In fact, it was AMD&#x27;s first entry in the x86 market other than as a second source for Intel. AMD 386SX processors were available at higher clock speeds at the time they were introduced and still cheaper than the Intel 386SX. Produced in 0.8 μm technology and using a static core, their clock speed could be dropped down to 0 MHz, consuming just some mWatts. Power consumption was up to 35% lower than with Intel&#x27;s design and even lower than the 386SL&#x27;s, making the AMD 386SX the ideal chip for both desktop and mobile computers. The SXL versions featured advanced power management functions and used even less power.

===Am386SX data===
* 16-bit data bus, no bus sizing option
* 24-bit physical address space, 16 Mbyte physical memory address space
* prefetch unit reads two bytes as one unit (like the 80286).
===Am386SE data===
* 16-bit data bus, no bus sizing option
* 24-bit physical address space, 16 Mbyte physical memory address space
* prefetch unit reads two bytes as one unit (like the 80286).
* no paging unit

==Embedded Am386 processors==

The Am386 processor core has been used in some embedded processors. In October 1993, AMD introduced the Am386SC processor, which integrated an Am386SXLV CPU core with a collection of PC/AT-compatible peripherals. This processor, marketed as &quot;Élan SC300&quot; and &quot;Élan SC310&quot;, was the first in AMD&#x27;s Élan series of SoCs. In 1994, AMD announced the Am386EM microcontroller, which integrated an Am386 CPU core with a collection of 80186-compatible peripherals rather than PC/AT peripherials. This chip does not, however, appear to have been released, although a datasheet exists.

==80387 coprocessor==
Floating point performance of the Am386 could be boosted with the addition of a 80387DX or 80387SX coprocessor, although performance would still not approach that of the on-chip FPU of the 486DX. This made the Am386DX a suboptimal choice for scientific applications and CAD using floating point intensive calculations. However, both were niche markets in the early 1990s and the chip sold well, first as a mid-range contender, and then as a budget chip. Although motherboards using the older 386 CPUs often had limited memory expansion possibilities and therefore struggled under Windows 95&#x27;s memory requirements, boards using the Am386 were sold well into the mid-1990s; at the end as budget motherboards for those who were only interested in running MS-DOS or Windows 3.1x applications.
The Am386 and its low-power successors were also popular choices for embedded systems, for a much longer period than their life span as PC processors.

<text>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) or corporate social impact is a form of international private business self-regulation which aims to contribute to societal goals of a philanthropic, activist, or charitable nature by engaging in, with, or supporting professional service volunteering through pro bono programs, community development, administering monetary grants to non-profit organizations for the public benefit, or to conduct ethically oriented business and investment practices. While CSR could have previously been described as an internal organizational policy or a corporate ethic strategy, similar to what is now known today as environmental, social, and governance (ESG), that time has passed as various companies have pledged to go beyond that or have been mandated or incentivized by governments to have a better impact on the surrounding community. In addition, national and international standards, laws, and business models have been developed to facilitate and incentivize this phenomenon. Various organizations have used their authority to push it beyond individual or industry-wide initiatives. In contrast, it has been considered a form of corporate self-regulation for some time, over the last decade or so it has moved considerably from voluntary decisions at the level of individual organizations to mandatory schemes at regional, national, and international levels. Moreover, scholars and firms are using the term &quot;creating shared value&quot;, an extension of corporate social responsibility, to explain ways of doing business in a socially responsible way while making profits (see the detailed review article of Menghwar and Daood, 2021).

Considered at the organisational level, CSR is generally understood as a strategic initiative that contributes to a brand&#x27;s reputation. As such, social responsibility initiatives must coherently align with and be integrated into a business model to be successful. With some models, a firm&#x27;s implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance with regulatory requirements and engages in &quot;actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law&quot;.

Furthermore, businesses may engage in CSR for strategic or ethical purposes. From a strategic perspective, CSR can contribute to firm profits, particularly if brands voluntarily self-report both the positive and negative outcomes of their endeavors. In part, these benefits accrue by increasing positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions. CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others. From an ethical perspective, some businesses will adopt CSR policies and practices because of the ethical beliefs of senior management: for example, the CEO of outdoor-apparel company Patagonia, Inc. argues that harming the environment is ethically objectionable.

Proponents argue that corporations increase long-term profits by operating with a CSR perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from businesses&#x27; economic role. A 2000 study compared existing econometric studies of the relationship between social and financial performance, concluding that the contradictory results of previous studies reporting positive, negative, and neutral financial impact were due to flawed empirical analysis and claimed when the study is properly specified, CSR has a neutral impact on financial outcomes. Critics have questioned the &quot;lofty&quot; and sometimes &quot;unrealistic expectations&quot; of CSR, or observed that CSR is merely window-dressing, or an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful multinational corporations. In line with this critical perspective, political and sociological institutionalists became interested in CSR in the context of theories of globalization, neoliberalism, and late capitalism.

== Definition ==
Since the 1960s, corporate social responsibility has attracted attention from a range of businesses, academics and stakeholders and been referred to by a number of other terms, including &quot;corporate sustainability&quot;, &quot;sustainable business&quot;, &quot;corporate conscience&quot;, &quot;corporate citizenship&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;social impact&quot;, &quot;conscious capitalism&quot;, and &quot;responsible business&quot;.

A wide variety of definitions have been developed, but with little consensus. Part of the definition problem has arisen because of the different interests represented. A business person may define CSR as a business strategy, an NGO activist may see it as &#x27;greenwash&#x27; while a government official may see it as voluntary regulation. &quot;In addition, disagreement about the definition will arise from the disciplinary approach.&quot; For example, while an economist might consider the director&#x27;s discretion necessary for CSR to be implemented a risk of agency costs, a law academic may consider that discretion to be an appropriate expression of what the law demands from directors. In the 1930s, two law professors, A. A. Berle and Merrick Dodd, famously debated how directors should be made to uphold the public interest: Berle believed there had to be legally enforceable rules in favor of labor, customers and the public equal to or ahead of shareholders, while Dodd argued that powers of directors were simply held on trust.

Corporate social responsibility was defined by Sheehy as &quot;international private business self-regulation&quot;. Sheehy examined a range of different disciplinary approaches to defining CSR. The definitions reviewed included the economic definition of &quot;sacrificing profits&quot;, a management definition of &quot;beyond compliance&quot;, institutionalist views of CSR as a &quot;socio-political movement,&quot; and the law&#x27;s focus on directors&#x27; duties. Further, Sheehy considered Archie B. Carroll&#x27;s description of CSR as a pyramid of responsibilities, namely, economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic responsibilities. While Carroll was not defining CSR, but simply arguing for the classification of activities, Sheehy developed a definition differently following the philosophy of science—the branch of philosophy used for explaining phenomena.

Carroll extended corporate social responsibility from the traditional economic and legal responsibility to ethical and philanthropic responsibility in response to the rising concerns on ethical issues in businesses. A review of 14,523 articles found that stakeholder perspective is the most prevalent dimension of corporate social responsibility. This view is reflected in the &quot;Business Dictionary&quot; that defines CSR as &quot;a company&#x27;s sense of responsibility towards the community and environment (both ecological and social) in which it operates. Companies express this citizenship (1) through their waste and pollution reduction processes, (2) by contributing educational and social programs, and (3) by earning adequate returns on the employed resources.&quot;

== Consumer perspectives ==
Most consumers agree that while achieving business targets, companies should engage in CSR efforts at the same time. Most consumers believe companies doing charity work will receive a positive response. Somerville also found that consumers are loyal and willing to spend more on retailers that support charity. Consumers also believe that retailers selling local products will gain loyalty. Smith (2013) shares the belief that marketing local products will gain consumer trust. However, environmental efforts are receiving negative views, given the belief that this would affect customer service. Oppewal et al. (2006) found that not all CSR activities are attractive to consumers. They recommended that retailers focus on one activity. Becker-Olsen (2006) found that if the social initiative done by the company is not aligned with other company goals it will have a negative impact. Mohr et al. (2001) and Groza et al. (2011) also emphasise the importance of reaching the consumer.

== Approaches ==

Some commentators have identified a difference between the Canadian (Montreal school of CSR), the Continental European, and the Anglo-Saxon approaches to CSR. It has been described that for Chinese consumers a socially responsible company makes safe, high-quality products; for Germans it provides secure employment; in South Africa it makes a positive contribution to social needs such as health care and education. Even within Europe, the discussion about CSR is very heterogeneous.

A more common approach to CSR is corporate philanthropy. This includes monetary donations and aid given to nonprofit organizations and communities. Donations are made in areas such as the arts, education, housing, health, social welfare, and the environment, among others, but excluding political contributions and commercial event sponsorship.

Another approach to CSR is to incorporate the CSR strategy directly into operations, such as procurement of Fair Trade tea and coffee.

Creating shared value, or CSV, is based on the idea that corporate success and social welfare are interdependent. The &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article &quot;Strategy &amp; Society: The Link between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility&quot; provided examples of companies that have developed deep linkages between their business strategies and CSR. CSV acknowledges trade-offs between short-term profitability and social or environmental goals, but emphasizes the opportunities for competitive advantage from building a social value proposition into corporate strategy. CSV gives the impression that only two stakeholders are essential – shareholders and consumers.

Many companies employ benchmarking to assess their CSR policy, implementation, and effectiveness. Benchmarking involves reviewing competitor initiatives, measuring and evaluating the impact those policies have on society and the environment, and how others perceive competitor CSR strategy.

Meehan, Meehan and Richard developed a model known as the 3C-SR model, published in a frequently cited article in 2006, which aimed to offer &quot;a new strategic approach to corporate responsibility&quot;. Their model sought to fill the gap between corporate social responsibility definitions and strategy, which the authors perceived to be an issue, and to provide guidance to managers on connecting businesses with ethically-aware consumers.

An approach described by Tóth Gergely and published by the Hungarian Association for Environmentally Aware Management (KÖVET) refers to &quot;Deep CSR&quot; and the role of a &quot;Truly Responsible Enterprise&quot;. Gergely&#x27;s definition of &quot;Deep CSR&quot; is the behaviour displayed by a &quot;Truly Responsible Enterprise&quot; (TRE), which:
* sees itself as a part of the system, not a completely individual economic actor concerned only about maximizing its profit,
* recognises unsustainability (the destruction of the natural environment and the increase of social injustice) as the greatest challenge of our age,
* accepts that businesses and enterprises have to work on solutions according to their economic weight,
* honestly evaluates its weight and part in causing the problems (it is best to concentrate on 2–3 main problems),
* takes essential steps – systematically, progressively, and focused – towards a more sustainable world.
The five principles of the TRE are:
#minimal transport
#maximal fairness
#zero economism
#maximum middle size (deep CSR is more readily embedded in small and medium-sized enterprises)
#product or service falling to the most sustainable 30%.

=== Cost-benefit analysis ===
In competitive markets, the cost-benefit analysis of CSR initiatives can be examined using a resource-based view (RBV). According to Barney (1990), &quot;formulation of the RBV, sustainable competitive advantage requires that resources be valuable (V), rare (R), inimitable (I) and non-substitutable (S)&quot;. A firm introducing a CSR-based strategy might only sustain high returns on their investment if their CSR-based strategy could not be copied (I). However, should competitors imitate such a strategy that might increase overall social benefits? Firms that choose CSR for strategic financial gain are also acting responsibly.

RBV presumes that firms are bundles of heterogeneous resources and capabilities that are imperfectly mobile across firms. This imperfect mobility can produce competitive advantages for firms that acquire immobile resources. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) examined CSR activities and attributes as a differentiation strategy. They concluded that managers could determine the appropriate level of investment in CSR by conducting a cost-benefit analysis in the same way they analyze other investments. Reinhardt (1998) found that a firm engaging in a CSR-based strategy could only sustain an abnormal return if it could prevent competitors from imitating it.

* Moreover, regarding cost-benefit analysis, one should look at Waddock and Graves (1997), who showed that corporate social performance was positively linked to financial performance, meaning that the benefits of being socially responsible outweigh the costs. McWilliams and Siegel (2000) noted that Waddock and Graves had not considered innovation, that companies that incorporated CSR were also very innovative, and that the innovation drove financial performance, not CSR. Hull and Rothenberg (2007) then found that when companies are not innovative, a history of CSR does help financial performance.

==== CSR and corporate financial performance ====
The relationship between corporate social responsibility and a firm&#x27;s corporate financial performance is a phenomenon that is being explored in a variety of research studies that are being conducted across the world. Based on these research studies, including those undertaken by Sang Jun Cho, Chune Young Chung, and Jason Young, a positive relationship exists between a firm&#x27;s corporate social responsibility policies and corporate financial performance. To investigate this relationship, the researchers conducted a regression analysis and preceded the analysis with the provision of several measures that they utilized to serve as proxies for key financial performance indicators (i.e. return on assets serves as a proxy for profitability).

== Scope ==
Initially, CSR emphasized the official behaviour of individual firms. Later, it expanded to include supplier behaviour, the uses to which products were put, and how articles were disposed of after they lost value. Malcolm McIntosh notes also that focussing on the identifiable behaviour of individual businesses risks not including what he calls &quot;&quot;unincorporated&quot; market behaviour&quot; within the scope of CSR - actions attributable to market processes, and also calls for other factors including &quot;brand citizenship&quot; and &quot;illegitimate, informal or illegal activity&quot; to be considered as part of a more complete picture.

The term &quot;brand citizenship&quot; has been put forward because the public perception of an organisation may be associated with its branding rather than its corporate identity: McIntosh uses Virgin as an example. Similarly, Anne Bahr Thompson uses the same term and observes that companies adopting socially responsible behaviours are primarily investing in their reputations.

=== Supply chain ===
In the 21st century, corporate social responsibility in the supply chain has attracted attention from businesses and stakeholders. A corporation&#x27;s supply chain is the process by which several organizations, including suppliers, customers, and logistics providers, work together to provide a value package of products and services to the end-user, who is the customer.

Corporate social irresponsibility in the supply chain has greatly affected the reputation of companies, leading to many costs to solve the problems. For instance, incidents like the 2013 Savar building collapse, which killed over 1000 people, pushed companies to consider the impacts of their operations on society and the environment. On the other hand, the horsemeat scandal of 2013 in Europe affected many food retailers, including Tesco, the largest retailer in the United Kingdom, leading to the dismissal of the supplier. Corporate social irresponsibility from suppliers and retailers has greatly affected the stakeholders who lost trust in the affected business entities. Although sometimes it is not directly undertaken by the companies, they become accountable to the stakeholders. These surrounding issues have prompted supply chain management to consider the corporate social responsibility context. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggested that companies must include social responsibility in their reviews of component quality. They highlighted the use of technology to improve visibility across the supply chain.

===Corporate social initiatives===
Corporate social responsibility includes six types of corporate social initiatives:
* Corporate philanthropy: company donations to charity, including cash, goods, and services, sometimes via a corporate foundation
* Community volunteering: company-organized volunteer activities, sometimes while an employee receives pay for pro-bono work on behalf of a non-profit organization
* Socially-responsible business practices: ethically produced products that appeal to a customer segment
* Cause promotions and activism: company-funded advocacy campaigns
* Cause-related marketing: donations to charity based on product sales
* Corporate social marketing: company-funded behavior-change campaigns

All six of the corporate initiatives are forms of corporate citizenship. However, only some of these CSR activities rise to the level of cause marketing, defined as &quot;a type of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in which a company&#x27;s promotional campaign has the dual purpose of increasing profitability while bettering society.&quot;

Companies generally do not have a profit motive when participating in corporate philanthropy and community volunteering. On the other hand, the remaining corporate social initiatives can be examples of cause marketing, in which there is both a societal interest and a profit motive.

== Implementation ==
CSR may be based within the human resources, business development or public relations departments of an organisation, or may be a separate unit reporting to the CEO or the board of directors.

=== Engagement plan ===
An engagement plan can assist in reaching the desired audience. A corporate social responsibility individual or team plans the goals and objectives of the organization. As with any corporate activity, a defined budget demonstrates commitment and scales the program&#x27;s relative importance.

=== Accounting, auditing, and reporting ===
Social accounting is the communication of social and environmental effects of a company&#x27;s economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large.

Social accounting emphasizes the notion of corporate accountability. Crowther defines social accounting as &quot;an approach to reporting a firm&#x27;s activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behavior, the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques.&quot;

Modern CSR has a wide range of different standards, frameworks and metrics for reporting and disclosing the social, environmental and economic issues. However, there is no single, fixed standard and the complex, dynamic and contextual nature of CSR means different companies and stakeholders adopt different approaches depending on their needs. 

There are a range of reporting guidelines and standards that serve as frameworks for social accounting, auditing, and reporting:
* AccountAbility&#x27;s AA1000 standard, based on John Elkington&#x27;s triple bottom line (3BL) reporting
* The Prince&#x27;s Accounting for Sustainability Project&#x27;s Connected Reporting Framework
* The Fair Labor Association conducts audits based on its Workplace Code of Conduct and posts audit results on the FLA website.
* The Fair Wear Foundation verifies labour conditions in companies&#x27; supply chains using interdisciplinary auditing teams.
* Global Reporting Initiative&#x27;s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines
* Economy for the Common Good&#x27;s Common Good Balance Sheet
* GoodCorporation&#x27;s standard developed in association with the Institute of Business Ethics
* Synergy Codethic 26000 Social Responsibility and Sustainability Commitment Management System (SRSCMS) Requirements—Ethical Business Best Practices of Organizations—the necessary management system elements to obtain a certifiable ethical commitment management system. The standard scheme has been built around ISO 26000 and UNCTAD Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance. The standard applies to any organization.
* Earthcheck Certification / Standard
* Social Accountability International&#x27;s SA8000 standard
* Standard Ethics Aei guidelines
* The ISO 14000 environmental management standard
* The United Nations Global Compact requires companies to communicate their progress (or to produce a Communication on Progress, COP), and to describe the company&#x27;s implementation of the Compact&#x27;s ten universal principles.
* The United Nations Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR) provides voluntary technical guidance on eco-efficiency indicators, corporate responsibility reporting, and corporate governance disclosure.
* The FTSE Group publishes the FTSE4Good Index, an evaluation of CSR performance of companies.
* EthicalQuote (CEQ) tracks the reputation of the world&#x27;s largest companies on Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG), Corporate Social Responsibility, ethics, and sustainability.
* The Islamic Reporting Initiative (IRI) is a not-for-profit organization that leads the creation of the IRI framework; the guiding integrated CSR reporting framework based on Islamic principles and values.

Legal requirements for social accounting, auditing, and reporting exist in nations like France. However, international or national agreement on meaningful social and environmental performance measurements has not been achieved. Many companies produce externally audited annual reports that cover Sustainable Development and CSR issues (&quot;Triple Bottom Line Reports&quot;), but the reports vary widely in format, style, and evaluation methodology (even within the same industry). Critics dismiss these reports as lip service, citing examples such as Enron&#x27;s yearly &quot;Corporate Responsibility Annual Report&quot; and tobacco companies&#x27; social reports.

In South Africa, as of June 2010, all companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) were required to produce an integrated report in place of an annual financial report and sustainability report. An integrated report reviews environmental, social, and economic performance alongside financial performance. This requirement was implemented in the absence of formal or legal standards. An Integrated Reporting Committee (IRC) was established to issue guidelines for good practice.

One of the reputable institutions that capital markets turn to for credible sustainability reports is the Carbon Disclosure Project, or CDP.

=== Verification ===
Consumers of goods and services should verify corporate social responsibility and the results of reports and efforts. The accounting, auditing, and reporting resources provide a foundation for consumers to verify that their products are socially sustainable. Due to an increased awareness of the need for CSR, many industries have their verification resources. They include organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council (paper and forest products), International Cocoa Initiative, and Kimberly Process (diamonds). The United Nations Global Compact provides frameworks not only for verification, but also for reporting human rights violations in corporate supply chains.

=== Ethics training ===
The rise of ethics training inside corporations, some of which are required by government regulation, has helped CSR to spread. Such training aims to help employees make ethical decisions when the answers are unclear. The most direct benefit is reducing the likelihood of &quot;dirty hands&quot;, fines, and damaged reputations for breaching laws or moral norms. Organizations see increased employee loyalty and pride in the organization.

=== Common actions ===
Common CSR actions include:
* Environmental sustainability: recycling, waste management, water management, renewable energy, reusable materials, &#x27;greener&#x27; supply chains, reducing paper use, and adopting Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) building standards.
*Human capital enhancement: Companies provide additional resources for capacity building of local employees, including technical and professional training, adult basic education, and language classes.
* Community involvement: This can include raising money for local charities, providing volunteers, sponsoring local events, employing local workers, supporting local economic growth, engaging in fair trade practices, etc.
* Ethical marketing: Companies that ethically market to consumers are placing a higher value on their customers and respecting them as people who are ends in themselves. They do not try to manipulate or falsely advertise to potential consumers. This is important for companies that want to be viewed as ethical.
* Supply Chain Management: Ensuring responsible procurement practices, including avoiding child labor and forced labor, conducting regular social and environmental audits of suppliers, and supporting fair trade practices. This can enhance transparency and ethical standards throughout the supply chain.

=== Social license to operate ===
The term &quot;social license&quot; was introduced in 1997 and has since been applied in multiple resource extraction industries to describe changes in company-community interactions. This use of social license has included an understanding of how acceptance levels impact resource development operations within these industries. Gunningham et al. state corporations comply with their social license by operating within societal expectations and avoiding activities (or influential elements within them) considered unacceptable, and define social license it as &quot;the demands on and expectations for a business enterprise that emerge from neighborhoods, environmental groups, local stakeholders, and other elements of the surrounding civil society&quot;.

Social License to Operate can be determined as contractual grounds for the legitimacy of activities and projects a company is involved in. It refers to the level of support and approval of a company&#x27;s activities by its stakeholders. Displaying commitment to CSR is one way to achieve a social license, by enhancing a company&#x27;s reputation.

As stated in &quot;Enduring value:&quot; the Australian minerals industry framework for sustainable development the concept of the &#x27;social license to operate&#x27;, then defined simply as obtaining and maintaining broad community support and acceptance. Unless a company earns and maintains that license, social license holders may intend to block project developments; employees may leave the company for a company that is a better corporate citizen: and companies may be under ongoing legal challenge. Issues related to the government&#x27;s measurement of corporations&#x27; social license include its role in licensure processes, the penalties for non-compliance, or the community&#x27;s ability to halt a project if a corporation is not responsive to their concerns, are still subject to global concern. Regardless of government involvement, social license is achieved within and given by communities, which is defined as &quot;a social unit of any size that shares common values, or that is situated in a given geographical area&quot;. Lacey suggested that social license can take a long time for a corporation or industry to achieve, but social license can be lost very quickly for a variety of factors, including changes in stakeholder expectations, technology, or other disturbances. Gunningham et al. stated that meeting and exceeding regulations to build reputational capital is economically vital, saying: &quot;in certain circumstances, [natural resource-based industries] cannot afford to do otherwise&quot;. In communities with a diverse economy, achieving social license is often much more complex than in local communities, which depend economically on the natural resource industry.

In research undertaken by Ketola &quot;et al.&quot;, the writers believed that the forest products industry in rural Michigan in the United States may have received a social license through the channels that mining corporations initially established and the long history of logging and copper mining in the area continued to shape the attitudes and identities of industry participants to present day. They found that local stakeholders and local industry operators have shared history and experience as having limited power to control the larger economic forces acting upon them. Local actors are more likely to have values similar to those of stakeholders, have established some history in the area, and have had the time to develop meaningful relationships within the community. This shared experience shaped the process of acquiring a social license. Nonlocal actors are likely to experience a much lesser degree of social license than local actors. Furthermore, many of the resources affected by forest management are held in the public trust, so it is essential for both industry actors and community stakeholders to feel engaged and involved in decisions regarding local natural resource management. Baines and Edwards shared similar findings in New Zealand&#x27;s aquaculture sector regarding the importance of relationships and communication between industry and local stakeholders. They find that social license depends on relationships and building trust. Smaller, local companies tend towards relationships that are relational as opposed to transactional, possibly due to their ongoing community presences and communication abilities, which are better for fostering these relationships and trust building.

In research of Requisite Organization, Elliott Jaques defines Social License to Operate for the company as the social contract the company has with the social license holders (employees, trade unions, communities, government) for them to manifest positive intention to support the business short- and long-term objectives by &quot;providing managerial leadership that nurtures the social good and also gives the foundation for sustainable growth in organizational results.&quot;

The primary objective for the companies is to obtain and maintain the Social License to Operate. Based on the Requisite Organization, to achieve this goal, a company needs to:
* Identify the business strategy and business objectives
* Identify the social license holders (employees of a company, labour unions, local and national governments, communities, activist groups, etc.) for every business objectives
* Identify the support that the company desires to achieve from the social license holders by specifying for every business objective social license element (target of support, context of support, time of support, action of support)
* Quantitatively measure the intention (positive or negative) of the social license holders to support the business objectives
* Identify the factors that negatively impact the intention of the social license holders to support the business objectives (strength of their belief in support, their evaluation of support outcomes, the pressure to provide support, enablers/disablers of support, etc.)
* Develop the Social License Development Strategy to remove the negative factors and ensure the positive intention of all the social license holders to support all the company&#x27;s business objectives.
* Perform ongoing monitoring and quantitative measurement of changes in the Social License to Operate of the company

=== Emerging markets vs. developed economies ===
A positive relationship has been shown to exist between CSR and a firm&#x27;s corporate financial performance. However, results from these analyses may need to be examined under different lenses for emerging and developed economies, especially since firms based in emerging economies oftentimes have weak firm-level governance.

For companies operating in emerging markets, engaging in CSR practices enables widespread reach into a variety of outside markets, an improved reputation, and stakeholder relationships. In all cases (emerging markets vs. developed economies), implementing CSR policies into the daily activities and framework of a company has been shown to allow for a competitive advantage versus other companies, including the creation of a positive image for the company, improved stakeholder relationships, increased employee morale, and attraction of new consumers who are committed to social responsibility. Despite all of the benefits, it is important to note that several drawbacks exist, including possible accusations of hypocrisy, the difficulty of measuring the social impact of CSR policies, and oftentimes placing companies at a disadvantage against competitors when prioritizing CSR ahead of advancing a company&#x27;s R&amp;D.

== Potential business benefits ==
A large body of literature urges businesses to adopt non-financial measures of success (e.g., Deming&#x27;s Fourteen Points, balanced scorecards). While CSR benefits are hard to quantify, Orlitzky, Schmidt and Rynes found a correlation between social/environmental performance and financial performance.

The business case for CSR within a company employs one or more of these arguments:

=== Triple bottom line ===
&quot;People, planet, and profit&quot;, also known as the triple bottom line, form one way to evaluate CSR.
&quot;People&quot; refers to fair labour practices, the community, and the region where the business operates.
&quot;Planet&quot; refers to sustainable environmental practices. Profit is the economic value created by the organization after deducting the cost of all inputs, including the cost of the capital (unlike accounting definitions of profit).

Balancing economic, ecological, and social goals is at the heart of the triple bottom line.

This measure was claimed to help some companies be more conscious of their social and moral responsibilities. However, critics claim that it is selective and substitutes a company&#x27;s perspective for that of the community. Another criticism is about the absence of a standard auditing procedure.

The term was coined by John Elkington in 1994 who re-evaluated it in 2018 and called for more urgent action toward sustainability 

=== Human resources ===
A CSR program can be an aid to recruitment and retention, particularly within the competitive graduate student market. Potential recruits often consider a firm&#x27;s CSR policy. CSR can also help improve the perception of a company among its staff, particularly when staff can become involved through payroll giving, fundraising activities, or community volunteering. CSR has been credited with encouraging customer orientation among customer-facing employees.

CSR is known for impacting employee turnover. Several executives suggest that employees are their most valuable asset and that the ability to retain them leads to organizational success. Socially responsible activities promote fairness, which in turn generates lower employee turnover. On the other hand, if a firm demonstrates irresponsible behavior, employees may view this behavior as negative. Proponents argue that treating employees well with competitive pay and good benefits is seen as socially responsible behavior and, therefore, reduces employee turnover. Executives have a strong desire for building a positive work context that benefits CSR and the company as a whole. This interest is driven particularly by the realization that a positive work environment can result in desirable outcomes such as more favorable job attitudes and increased work performance.

The IBM Institute for Business Value surveyed 250 business leaders worldwide in 2008. The survey showed that businesses have assimilated a much more strategic view with 68% of companies utilizing CSR as an opportunity and part of a sustainable growth strategy. Developing and implementing a CSR strategy represents a unique opportunity to benefit the company. However, only 31% of businesses surveyed engaged their employees on the company&#x27;s CSR objectives and initiatives. Employee engagement on CSR initiatives can be a powerful recruitment and retention tool. Moreover, employees tend to avoid employers with a bad reputation.

=== Risk management ===
Managing risk is an important executive responsibility. Reputations that take decades to build up can be ruined in hours through corruption scandals or environmental accidents. These situations draw unwanted attention from regulators, courts, governments, and the media. CSR can limit these risks.

Sustainability is key to resilience across value chains. As companies prefer working with long-lasting partners, those that have implemented CSR practices will be preferred over ones that have not in order to minimize reputational as well as other damages. High levels of CSR compliance within supply chains (including Tier 1 and beyond) will also help reduce vulnerabilities and eliminate environmental, social, and economic risks through implementing a sustainability-focused procurement strategy.

With effective CSR policies, a company can better mitigate legislative and legal risks by complying with emerging CSR-related laws and regulations, preempting costly lawsuits and non-compliance actions, and addressing sources of non-compliance by fostering corporate alignment around the relevant issues.

=== Brand differentiation ===
CSR can enhance a brand&#x27;s reputation by &quot;inducing a desire to support and help the company that has acted to benefit consumers&quot;. In this way, CSR serves to enhance brand perceptions, which can lead to positive product evaluations, though this effect is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the degree to which consumers value close relationships or believe that the CSR initiative is self-serving, whether the CSR program may be perceived to affect product quality negatively, consumers&#x27; consumption-related goals (i.e., whether their consumption is socially versus product-motivated), or consumers&#x27; attributions toward the motives of the CSR endeavor.

Some companies use their commitment to CSR as their primary positioning tool, e.g., The Co-operative Group, The Body Shop, and American Apparel. Others use CSR methodologies as a strategic tactic to gain public support for their presence in global markets, helping them sustain a competitive advantage by using their social contributions as another form of advertising.

Companies that operate strong CSR activities tend to drive customers&#x27; attention to buy products or services regardless of the price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers are aware of the company&#x27;s CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not only add value to the company, but also to the products or services. Furthermore, firms under intense competition can leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm&#x27;s performance. Lowering the carbon footprint of a firm&#x27;s distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company&#x27;s commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.

Whole Foods&#x27; marketing and promotion of organic foods have had a positive effect on the supermarket industry. Proponents assert that Whole Foods has been able to work with its suppliers to improve animal treatment and the quality of meat offered in their stores. They also promote local agriculture in over 2,400 independent farms to maintain their line of sustainable organic produce. As a result, Whole Foods&#x27; high prices do not turn customers away from shopping. They are pleased to buy organic products that come from sustainable practices.

A &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article proposes three stages of practice in which CSR can be divided. Stage one focuses on philanthropy, including donations of money or equipment to non-profit organizations, engagement with community initiatives, and employee volunteering. This is characterized as the &quot;soul&quot; of a company, expressing the social and environmental priorities of the founders. The authors assert that companies engage in CSR because they are an integral part of society. The Coca-Cola Company contributes $88.1 million annually to various environmental, educational, and humanitarian organizations. Another example is PNC Financial Services&#x27; &quot;Grow Up Great&quot; childhood education program. This program provides critical school readiness resources to underserved communities where PNC operates.

On the other hand, stage two focuses on improving operational effectiveness in the workplace. The researchers assert that programs in this stage strive to deliver social or environmental benefits to support a company&#x27;s operation across the value chain by improving efficiency. Some examples include sustainability initiatives to reduce resource use, waste, and emissions that could reduce costs. It also calls for investing in employee work conditions such as health care and education, which may enhance productivity and retention. Unlike philanthropic giving, which is evaluated by its social and environmental return, initiatives in the second stage are predicted to improve the corporate bottom line with social value. Grupo Bimbo, the largest bakery in Mexico, is an excellent example of this. The company strives to meet social welfare needs. It offers free educational services to help employees complete high school. Bimbo also provides supplementary medical care and financial assistance to close government health coverage gaps.

Moreover, the third stage of the program aims to transform the business model. Companies create new forms of business to address social or environmental challenges that will lead to financial returns in the long run. One example can be seen in Unilever&#x27;s Project Shakti in India. The authors describe that the company hires women in villages and provides them with micro-finance loans to sell soaps, oils, detergents, and other products door-to-door. This research indicates that more than 65,000 women entrepreneurs are doubling their incomes while increasing rural access and hygiene in Indian villages. Another example is IKEA&#x27;s &quot;People and Planet&quot; initiative, which is to be 100% sustainable by 2020. Consequently, the company wants to introduce a new model to collect and recycle old furniture.

=== Reduced scrutiny ===
Corporations are keen to avoid interference in their business through taxation or regulations. A CSR program can persuade governments and the public that a company takes health and safety, diversity, and the environment seriously, reducing the likelihood that company practices will be closely monitored.

=== Supplier relations ===
Appropriate CSR programs can increase the attractiveness of supplier firms to potential customer corporations. For example, a fashion merchandiser may find value in an overseas manufacturer that uses CSR to establish a positive image and to reduce the risks of bad publicity from uncovered misbehavior.

A price-focused procurement strategy has limitations for companies with high CSR expectations. According to Boston Consulting Group, “businesses that are considered leaders in environmental, social and governance criteria have an 11% valuation premium over their competitors.” Such companies look for suppliers who share their social, environmental, and business ethics values, which in turn would trigger common innovations that would attract more customers and generate further value for the whole supply chain for a win-win business relationship through a series of interconnected activities implemented holistically. Furthermore, supplier relations are crucial for a company&#x27;s CSR profile as 70% of businesses’ social and environmental impacts occur in their supply chain. Through the spillover effect, CSR programs encourage sustainable practices within different industries. Additionally, a CSR-focused supplier relations management improves collaboration with suppliers, increases the satisfaction of customers’ expectations and requirements, expands market opportunities, enhances investor relations, and promotes the development of more sustainable products. Furthermore, CSR supply chain imperatives can leverage their responsible commitment to forge robust and lasting relationships with important stakeholders and positively influence the decision-making of consumers, partners, investors, and talent. By constructing this reputational capital, companies can earn consumer loyalty, attract top talent, and strengthen employee morale and commitment.

=== Crisis management ===
CSR strategies or behaviors related to CSR were discussed by many scholars in terms of crisis management, such as responses to boycotts in an international context. Ang found that relationship building through providing additional services rather than price-cutting is what businesses in Asia feel more comfortable with as a strategy during an economic crisis. Regarding direct research about strategies in cross-cultural crisis management, scholars found that CSR strategies could make effects through empirical case studies involving multinational businesses in China. They found that meeting local stakeholders&#x27; social expectations can mitigate the risk of crises. The strategy utilized by Arla Foods works and has helped the company regain most of its lost market share among many countries in the Middle East. Arla Foods founded funding for children with cancer, and they donated ambulances to refugees in Lebanon. As Arla Foods did, they tried to contribute to solving social problems of children&#x27;s access to health care, which were local priorities. Other researchers analyzed the case of multinational enterprise strategies during the conflict between Lebanon and Israel. During the conflict, many companies stressed seeking to help the local community. In the post-conflict stage, managers highlighted their philanthropic programs and contributions, in terms of monetary in-kind donations to the refugees or businesses that were directly affected. For example, Citibank has provided monetary assistance to some local businesses affected by the war. Another activity done by a Lebanese company was a fund-raising campaign.

== Criticisms and concerns ==
CSR concerns include its relationship to the purpose of business and the motives for engaging in it.

===Purpose of business ===
Milton Friedman and others argued that a corporation&#x27;s purpose is to maximize returns to its shareholders and that obeying the laws of the jurisdictions within which it operates constitutes socially responsible behavior. Friedman argued each person should be free to spend their own money on social causes if they wished, but that business owners should avoid putting a &quot;tax&quot; on consumers as &quot;unwitting puppets&quot; of socialism by raising prices to support business practices with social goals unrelated to profit.

While some CSR supporters claim that companies practicing CSR, especially in developing countries, are less likely to exploit workers and communities, critics claim that CSR itself imposes outside values on local communities with unpredictable outcomes.

Rather than voluntary measures, better governmental regulation and enforcement are an alternative to CSR that moves decision-making and resource allocation from public to private bodies. However, critics claim that effective CSR must be voluntary as mandatory social responsibility programs regulated by the government interferes with people&#x27;s plans and preferences, distorts the allocation of resources, and increases the likelihood of irresponsible decisions.

=== Motives ===
Some critics believe that companies undertake CSR programs to distract the public from ethical questions posed by their core operations. They argue that the reputational benefits that CSR companies receive (cited above as a benefit to the corporation) demonstrate the hypocrisy of the approach. Moreover, some studies find that CSR programs are motivated by corporate managers&#x27; interests at the cost of the shareholders so they are a type of an agency problem in corporations.

Others have argued that the primary purpose of CSR is to provide legitimacy to the power of businesses. As wealth inequality is perceived to be increasing it has become increasingly necessary for businesses to justify their position of power.

Joel Bakan is one of the prominent critics of the conflict of interest between private profit and a public good, characterizing corporate officials of publicly listed corporations as constrained by law to maximize the wealth of their shareholders. This argument is summarised by Haynes that &quot;a corporate calculus exists in which costs are pushed onto both workers, consumers and the environment&quot;. CSR spending may be seen in these financial terms, whereby the higher costs of socially undesirable behaviour are offset by a CSR spending of a lower amount. Indeed, it has been argued that there is a &quot;halo effect&quot; in terms of CSR spending. Research has found that firms that had been convicted of bribery in the US under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) received more lenient fines if they had been seen to be actively engaging in comprehensive CSR practices. It was found that typically either a 20% increase in corporate giving or a commitment to eradicating a significant labour issue, such as child labour, was equated to a 40% lower fine in the case of bribing foreign officials.

Aguinis and Glavas conducted a comprehensive review of CSR literature, covering 700 academic sources from numerous fields, including organizational behavior, corporate strategy, marketing, and HRM. It was found that the primary reason for firms to engage in CSR was the expected financial benefits associated with CSR, rather than being motivated by a desire to be responsible to society. Consistent with this analysis, consumers respond less favorably to CSR initiatives that they believe are tainted with self-serving motives&quot;.

=== Ethical ideologies ===
CEOs&#x27; political ideologies are evident manifestations of their different personal views. Each CEO may exercise different powers according to their organizational outcomes. Their political ideologies are expected to influence their preferences for CSR outcomes. Proponents argue that politically liberal CEOs will envision the practice of CSR as beneficial and desirable to increase a firm&#x27;s reputation. They tend to focus more on how the firm can meet the needs of society. Consequently, they will advance with the practice of CSR while adding value to the firm. On the other hand, property rights may be more relevant to conservative CEOs. Since conservatives tend to value free markets, individualism, and the call for respect of authority, they will not likely envision this practice as often as those identifying as liberals might.

The company&#x27;s financials and the CSR practice also have a positive relationship. Moreover, a company&#x27;s performance tends to influence conservatives more likely than liberals. While not seeing it from the financial performance point of view, liberals tend to believe that CSR adds to the business&#x27;s triple bottom line. For example, when the company performs well, it will promote CSR. If the company is not performing as expected, they will rather tend to emphasize this practice because it will potentially envision it as a way to add value to the business. In contrast, politically conservative CEOs will tend to support the practice of CSR if they believe that it will provide a good return to the company&#x27;s financials. In other words, these types of executives tend to not see the outcome of CSR as a value to the company if it does not provide anything in exchange.

=== Misdirection ===
There have been unsubstantiated social efforts, ethical claims, and outright greenwashing by some companies that have resulted in increasing consumer cynicism and mistrust. Sometimes companies use CSR to direct public attention away from other, harmful business practices. For example, McDonald&#x27;s Corporation positioned its association with Ronald McDonald House and other children&#x27;s charities as CSR while its meals have been accused of promoting poor eating habits.

Acts that may initially appear to be altruistic CSR may have ulterior motives. The funding of scientific research projects has been used as a source of misdirection by firms. Stanley B. Prusiner, who discovered the protein responsible for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) and won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Medicine, thanked the tobacco company RJ Reynolds for their crucial support. RJ Reynolds funded the research into CJD. Proctor states that &quot;the tobacco industry was the leading funder of research into genetics, viruses, immunology, air pollution&quot;, anything which formed a distraction from the well-established research linking smoking and cancer.

Research has also found that corporate social marketing, a form of CSR promoting societal good, is being used to direct criticism away from the damaging practices of the alcohol industry. It has been shown that advertisements that supposedly encourage responsible drinking simultaneously aim to promote drinking as a social norm. In this case, companies may engage in CSR and social marketing to prevent more stringent government legislation on alcohol marketing.

=== Controversial industries ===
Industries such as tobacco, alcohol, or munitions firms make products that damage their consumers or the environment. Such firms may engage in the same philanthropic activities as other industries. This duality complicates assessments of such firms concerning CSR.

==== Case studies ====
To fully observe the impact of corporate social responsibility practices on a firm&#x27;s corporate financial performance, it is crucial to delve into a concrete example, such as the study conducted by researchers from the Global Conference on Business, Economics, Management, and Tourism. In this study, Mocan, Draghici, Ivascu, and Turi examined the correlation between CSR policies and value creation/financial performance in the banking industry specifically and found that various benefits include greater economic efficiency, improved company reputation, and employee loyalty, better communication streamline between the industry and individuals, and the opportunity to attract new opportunities (i.e. attract new investments, or remain competitive) and improve organizational commitment. However, before discussing these effects, the researchers preceded the analysis by stating that typically implementing CSR and other ethical principles within the framework of a financial institution such as banks make it seem as if these are marketing tools for attracting and communicating with stakeholders rather than serving as tools that allow banks and other financial institutions to benefit the individuals that they serve. Another interesting case study is provided by Hein Schreuder (2022), who discusses the evolution of CSR at the Dutch multinational corporation DSM.

== Stakeholder influence ==
One motivation for corporations to adopt CSR is to satisfy stakeholders beyond those of a corporation&#x27;s shareholders.

Branco and Rodrigues (2007) describe the stakeholder perspective of CSR as the set of views of corporate responsibility held by all groups or constituents with a relationship to the firm. In their normative model, the company accepts these views as long as they do not hinder the organization. The stakeholder perspective fails to acknowledge the complexity of network interactions in cross-sector partnerships. It relegates communication to a maintenance function, similar to the exchange perspective.

=== Ethical consumerism ===
The rise in popularity of ethical consumerism over the last two decades can be linked to the rise of CSR. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental and social implications of their day-to-day consumption decisions and in some cases make purchasing decisions related to their environmental and ethical concerns.

One issue with the consumer&#x27;s relationship with CSR is that it is much more complex than it first appears. This phenomenon could be described as the &quot;CSR-Consumer Paradox&quot; or mismatch, where consumers report that they would only buy from companies with good social responsibility. Many consumers want to buy from responsible companies, but surveys indicate that &quot;ethical purchases&quot; are a small percentage of household expenditures. The discrepancy between consumer beliefs and intentions, and actual consumer behaviour, means CSR has a much lesser impact than consumers initially say.

One theory for explaining this discrepancy is the &quot;bystander apathy&quot; or the bystander effect. This theory stems from social psychology and states that the likelihood of an individual acting in a given situation is significantly reduced if other bystanders do nothing, even if that individual strongly believes in a specific course of action. It would suggest an &quot;If they do not care then why should I?&quot; mentality. Even if consumers are against the use of sweatshops or want to support green causes, they may continue to make purchases from companies that are socially irresponsible just because other consumers seem apathetic towards the issue.

Another explanation is that of reciprocal altruism. In the evolutionary psychology of human behaviour: people only do something if they can get something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking, making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual, even if they believe in supporting ethical, environmental, and socially beneficial causes.

=== Socially responsible investing ===
Shareholders and investors, through socially responsible investing (SRI), are using their capital to encourage behavior they consider responsible. However, definitions of what constitutes ethical behavior vary. For example, some religious investors in the United States have withdrawn investments from companies that violate their religious views. In contrast, secular investors divest from companies that they see as imposing religious views on workers or customers.

=== Public policies ===
Some national governments promote socially and environmentally responsible corporate practices. The heightened role of government in CSR has facilitated the development of numerous CSR programs and policies. Various European governments have pushed companies to develop sustainable corporate practices. CSR critics such as Robert Reich argued that governments should set the agenda for social responsibility with laws and regulations that describe how to conduct business responsibly.

Collective bargaining is a way nations promote CSR. In Germany, CSR is kept at the industry level instead of the workplace; this has been viewed as one of the strengths of the German government&#x27;s push for CPR. Germany also established the German Trade Union Confederation in 1949 to further advance CSR; the confederation represents the interests of 45 million workers in Germany. Job security, wage increases with industry growth are key aspects of collective bargaining in the German labor system.

There is a higher percentage of workers in unions in countries like Sweden and Iceland which have more Social-Democratic elements in their Nordic Model than the U.S. and the U.K.

The U.S. and the U.K. are Liberal Market Economies (LMEs), and the German economy falls under Coordinated Market Economy (CMEs), which are Varieties of Capitalism. In comparison with the U.S. that covers 25.5% of its blue and white-collar workforce under collective bargaining and the U.K. that covers 29% of its workforce, Germany covers a significantly higher 57% of its workforce under collective bargaining.

==== Regulation ====
Fifteen European Union countries are actively engaged in CSR regulation and public policy development. CSR efforts and policies are different among countries, responding to the complexity and diversity of governmental, corporate, and societal roles. Some studies have claimed that the role and effectiveness of these actors were case-specific. This variety among company approaches to CSR can complicate regulatory processes.

Canada adopted CSR in 2007. Prime Minister Harper encouraged Canadian mining companies to meet Canada&#x27;s newly developed CSR standards.

The &#x27;Heilbronn Declaration&#x27; is a voluntary agreement between enterprises and institutions in Germany, especially in the Heilbronn-Franconia region, signed on 15 September 2012. The approach of the Heilbronn Declaration targets the decisive factors of success or failure, the achievements of the implementation, and best practices regarding CSR. A form of responsible entrepreneurship shall be initiated to meet the requirements of stakeholders&#x27; trust in the economy. It is an approach to make voluntary commitments more binding.

In opposition to mandated CSR regulation, researchers Armstrong and Green suggest that all regulation is &quot;harmful&quot;, citing regulation as the cause of North Korea&#x27;s low economic freedom and per capita GDP. They further claim without source that &quot;There is no form of market failure, however egregious, which is not eventually made worse by the political interventions intended to fix it&quot;, and conclude &quot;there is no need for further research on regulation in the name of social responsibility.&quot;

==== Laws ====
In the 1800s, the US government could take away a firm&#x27;s license if it acted irresponsibly. Corporations were viewed as &quot;creatures of the state&quot; under the law. In 1819, the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Dartmouth College vs. Woodward&quot; established a corporation as a legal person in specific contexts. This ruling allowed corporations to be protected under the Constitution and prevented states from regulating firms. Countries have included CSR policies in government agendas.

On 16 December 2008, the Danish parliament adopted a bill that required the 1,100 largest Danish companies, investors, and state-owned companies to include CSR information in their financial reports. The reporting requirements became effective on 1 January 2009. The required information included:
* CSR/SRI policies
* How such policies are implemented in practice
* Results and management expectations

CSR/SRI is voluntary in Denmark, but if a company has no policy on this, it must state its position on CSR in financial reports.

In 1995, item S50K of the Income Tax Act of Mauritius mandated that companies registered in Mauritius pay 2% of their annual book profit to contribute to the social and environmental development of the country. In 2014, India also enacted a mandatory minimum CSR spending law. Under Companies Act, 2013, any company having a net worth of 500 crore or more or a turnover of 1,000 crore or a net profit of 5 crore must spend 2% of their net profits on CSR activities. The rules came into effect on 1 April 2014.

The only mandatory CSR Act in the world thus far was passed by the Indian parliament in 2013 as Section 135 of the Companies Act. According to that bill, all firms with a net worth above 5 billion rupees (approx. $75 million), turnover over 10 billion rupees (approx. $150 million), or net profit over 50 million rupees (approx. $750,000) are required to spend at least 2% of their annual profits (averaged over three years). The Act requires that all businesses affected establish a CSR committee to oversee the spending. Before this law was passed, CSR laws were applied only to public sector companies.

Unlike global definitions of CSR in the triple bottom line, corporate citizenship, sustainable business, business responsibility, and closed-loop realm, in India, CSR is a philanthropic activity. What has changed since formalizing it in 2014 is the shift in focus from institution building (schools, hospitals, etc.) to focus on community development.

=== Crises and their consequences ===
Crises have encouraged the adoption of CSR. The CERES principles were adopted following the 1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; incident. Other examples include the lead paint used by toymaker Mattel, which required the recall of millions of toys and caused the company to initiate new risk management and quality control processes. Magellan Metals was found responsible for lead contamination, which killed thousands of birds in Australia. The company ceased business immediately and had to work with independent regulatory bodies to execute a cleanup. Odwalla experienced a crisis, with sales dropping 90% and its stock price dropping 34% due to cases of &quot;E. coli&quot;. The company recalled all apple or carrot juice products and introduced a new process called &quot;flash pasteurization&quot;, as well as maintaining lines of communication constantly open with customers.

==National and regional approaches==
Corporations that employ CSR behaviors do not always behave consistently in all parts of the world. Conversely, a single behavior may not be considered ethical in all jurisdictions, e.g., some jurisdictions forbid women from driving, while others require women to be treated equally in employment decisions.

===CSR in the European Union===
The European Commission presented a green paper for the European Communities, as the EU was then called, &quot;promoting a European framework for Corporate Social Responsibility&quot; in 2001. In that document CSR was defined as By 2011, the Commission recognised a &quot;strategic approach&quot; to CSR as &quot;increasingly important too the competitiveness of enterprises&quot;. Believing that enterprises can &quot;significantly contribute to the European Union&#x27;s treaty objectives of sustainable development and a highly competitive social market economy&quot;, therefore presented a revised strategy in October 2011, &quot;A renewed EU strategy 2011–14 for Corporate Social Responsibility&quot;. In this document, CSR was defined more briefly as In parallel with CSR, the alternative term &quot;responsible business conduct&quot; (RBC) introduced by the OECD (see OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises) was also adopted. No longer treating CSR as a &quot;voluntary&quot; or is some sense &quot;additional&quot; aspect of managing an enterprise, the commission now stated that Actions planned under the 2011–2014 agenda were aimed at:
*Enhancing the visibility of CSR and disseminating good practices
*Improving and tracking levels of trust in business
*Improving self- and co-regulation processes
*Enhancing market reward for CSR
*Improving company disclosure of social and environmental information
*Further integrating CSR into education, training, and research
*Emphasising the importance of national and sub-national CSR policies, and
*Better aligning European and global approaches to CSR.
Subsequently, the Commission published a staff working document in March 2019 that examined the progress in implementing CSR/RBC as well as business and human rights.

=== UK retail sector ===
A 2006 study found that the UK retail sector showed the greatest rate of CSR involvement. Many of the big retail companies in the UK joined the Ethical Trading Initiative, an association established to improve working conditions and worker health.

Tesco (2013) reported that their &#x27;essentials&#x27; are &#x27;Trading responsibility&#x27;, &#x27;Reducing our Impact on the Environment&#x27;, &#x27;Being a Great Employer&#x27; and &#x27;Supporting Local Communities&#x27;. J Sainsbury employs the headings &#x27;Best for food and health&#x27;, &#x27;Sourcing with integrity&#x27;, &#x27;Respect for our environment&#x27;, &#x27;Making a difference to our community&#x27;, and &#x27;A great place to work&#x27;, etc. The four main issues to which UK retail companies are committed: environment, social welfare, ethical trading, and becoming an attractive workplace.

Anselmsson and Johansson (2007) assessed three areas of CSR performance: human responsibility, product responsibility, and environmental responsibility. Martinuzzi et al. described the terms, writing that human responsibility is &quot;the company deals with suppliers who adhere to principles of natural and good breeding and farming of animals, and also maintains fair and positive working conditions and workplace environments for their employees. Product responsibility means that all products come with a complete list of content, that country of origin is stated, and that the company will uphold its declarations of intent and assume liability for its products. Environmental responsibility means that a company is perceived to produce environmental-friendly, ecological, and non-harmful products&quot;. Jones et al. (2005) found that environmental issues are the most commonly reported CSR programs among top retailers.

=== CSR and US corporations updates ===
An article published in Forbes.com in September 2017 mentioned the yearly study of Boston-based reputation management consulting company Reputation Institute (RI) which rates the top 10 US corporations in terms of corporate social responsibility. RI monitors social responsibility reputations by focusing on the perception of consumers regarding company governance, positive impact on the community and society, and treatment of the workforce. It rates each criterion with the firm&#x27;s proprietary RepTrak Pulse platform. Forbes identified companies like Lego, Microsoft, Google, Walt Disney Company, BMW Group, Intel, Robert Bosch, Cisco Systems, Rolls-Royce Aerospace, and Colgate-Palmolive.

According to the CSR Journal, the millennial generation worldwide helps propel brands toward social responsibility. Many millennials want to conduct business with companies and trademarks that employ pro-social themes, sustainable manufacturing processes, and ethical business practices. Nielsen Holdings published its Annual Global Corporate Sustainability Report in 2017 concentrating on global responsibility as well as sustainability. Nielsen&#x27;s 2015 report showed that 66 percent of consumers will spend more on products that come from sustainable brands. Another 81 percent expect their preferred corporate institutions to reveal in public their statements about corporate citizenship

The National Association on the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), through its chief executive officer Derrick Johnson, shared the organization&#x27;s insights on how American corporations can help in the realization of social justice. According to the article from Yahoo News, the NAACP has been engaged in a crusade for racial justice and economic opportunities during the last 109 years. This organization believes all citizens in the United States must be held liable in ensuring democracy works for all people.

===CSR and the Indian perspective===
From an Indian perspective, corporate social responsibility is not just about how an organization distributes its profits, but is also about how it generates its revenue. Corporate social responsibility is defined as the ethos and practice of discovering, invoking, infusing, evoking, and radiating the human values of &#x27;righteousness&#x27; (&quot;dharma&quot;) and &#x27;love&#x27; (&quot;Prema&quot;) in an organisation&#x27;s interactions with its stakeholders. Stakeholders, in this definition, refers to the organisation&#x27;s customers, employees, shareholders, society, natural environment, business associates, regulatory agencies, future generations, etc.

International field policy expert Edmond Fernandes has provided various ways in which Indian companies can increase their investment efficiency and investment sufficiency by integrating social health in all policies. Non-government organizations like CHD Group and SEEDS have demonstrated ways in which smart and efficient CSR is possible.

<text>The National Industrial Basketball League was founded in 1947 to enable U.S. mill workers a chance to compete in basketball. The league was founded by the industrial teams (teams sponsored by the large companies and made up of their employees) belonging to the National Basketball League (NBL) that did not join the National Basketball Association when the NBL merged with the Basketball Association of America.

The NIBL teams participated every year in the AAU National tournament against teams from other amateur or semi-professional leagues.

==League history==
The league&#x27;s first year, 1947–48, featured five teams in an eight-game schedule—the Milwaukee Harnischfeger&#x27;s (which won the round robin schedule with an 8–0 record), Peoria Caterpillars, Milwaukee Allen-Bradleys, Akron Goodyear Wingfoots, and Fort Wayne General Electrics. The following season (1948-1949), with a 16-game schedule, the new lineup was league champion Bartlesville Phillips 66ers (15-1 record), Denver Chevvies, Peoria Caterpillars, Akron Goodyears/Akron Goodyear Wingfoots, and Milwaukee Allen-Bradleys.

In the 1949–50 season, with the addition of the Dayton Industrialists making the league a six-team circuit, the Phillips 66ers repeated as champions. The league expanded again in the 1950–51 season to eight teams, adding the (Oakland Blue &#x27;n Gold Atlas) and San Francisco Stewart Chevrolets. The Dayton team renamed as the Dayton Air Gems, and the Phillips 66ers repeated for their third consecutive title.

===High Point of League Expansion===

The league expanded to 11 teams, in 1951-52 with such new teams as the Los Angeles Fibber McGee &amp; Mollys, Artesia REA Travelers, and Santa Maria Golden Dukes. The 66ers just edged the Oakland Atlas-Pacific Engineers and the San Francisco Stewart Chevrolets for their fourth title, with a 17–5 record to their opponents 16-6 records that tied for second. The next season (1952-1953), the league dropped down to nine teams, but saw new opponents in the Houston Ada Oilers and the Los Angeles Kirby&#x27;s Shoes. The 66ers beat the Caterpillars for the title by one game, with a 13–3 record.

The Peoria Cats tied the 66ers for the 1953-54 title, each with a 10–4 record. The next two seasons, the 66ers and the Cats took first and second respectively. A new team in the greatly reduced circuit of five teams in 1955-56 was the Wichita Vickers.

The 1956–57 season was one of the most competitive in the NIBL history. While the 66ers again took first with a 13–7 record, four teams tied for second with 11-9 records, including the newly added Denver-Chicago Truckers. This proved to be the last season for the Milwaukee Allen-Bradleys, who finished last for the seventh time with a 3–17 record.

The 1957–58 season saw the Vickers move to the forefront, tying the 66ers for the league title with a 21–9 record. A new team that year was the Kansas City Kaycee&#x27;s.

===End of the Phillips 66ers Winning Streak===

In the 1958–59 season, the 66ers failed to take the league title for the first time since their coming to the league, finishing in third place. The Truckers finished first with a 21–9 record, with the Vickers runner-up at 19–11. Joining the league that season was the Seattle Buchan Bakers. However, in the 1959–60 season, the 66ers regained their title as league champions.

===Demise of the NIBL===

By the early 1960s, NIBL teams were increasingly struggling to compete with the salaries offered in professional league. Top college graduates increasingly gravitated to the NBA, and the NIBL began to decline in popularity and profitability. This is evidenced by the disbandment of the Peoria Cats at the end of the 1959–60 season.

In the NIBL&#x27;s final season, 1960–61, the league had dropped down to only six members divided into two divisions, Eastern (Cleveland Pipers, Akron Goodyears, New York Tuck Tapers) and Western (Denver-Chicago Truckers, Phillips 66ers, and Seattle Buchan Bakers). Instead of the round-robin schedule determining a winner, the league sponsored a four-team playoff. The Pipers beat the Truckers for the championship, 136–100. The 66ers beat the Goodyears for in a match for third place, 114–112.

In 1961, the league dropped their industrial sponsors and merged with other amateur leagues to form the National Alliance of Basketball Leagues (NABL). The Pipers and the Tapers left to join the newly formed American Basketball League in 1961.

==The amateur nature of the NIBL==
In the 1950s the salaries were about the same as the NBA and there was a job for all players in their companies. Some of them ended up being president of their companies, working there for a lifetime. Most of players wanted no part of the uncertain professional game, and instead were accepting a position with the companies, rejecting offers even from NBA.

The NIBL was dedicated to remaining amateur at a time when basketball was desperately trying to carve out some postwar space in the pro sports landscape. But professional basketball staggered forward and the NIBL flourished, mostly because its stability allowed companies to poach stars such as Bob Kurland.

The NIBL merged with other AAU leagues and reorganized into the National AAU Basketball League (NABL) in 1961.

<doc id="398363" wikidata="Q2109149" url="?curid=398363" title="Hellfire Club (comics)">
<text>The Hellfire Club is a fictional society appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Hellfire Club often comes into confrontation with the X-Men mutant superhero team. Although the Club appears to merely be an international social club for wealthy elites, its clandestine Inner Circle seeks to influence world events and advance their agenda.

The Hellfire Club was created in 1980 by the &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; writer/artist duo of Chris Claremont and John Byrne, who were inspired by a 1966 episode of the British television series &quot;The Avengers&quot; (&quot;A Touch of Brimstone&quot;). The name &quot;Hellfire Club&quot; was a popular name for gentlemen&#x27;s clubs in the 18th century. The Inner Circle&#x27;s hierarchy is modeled on the pieces of a chess set, with Black and White sets of Kings, Queens, Bishops and Rooks.

The Hellfire Club and its Inner Circle were introduced in &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot;, attempting to subvert the X-Men&#x27;s Jean Grey. This incarnation, composed most notably of Black King Sebastian Shaw and White Queen Emma Frost, would remain prominent for many years. After their initial confrontations, the Hellfire Club and the X-Men settled into an uneasy alliance. This eventually changed as endless power struggles perpetuated a series of upheavals within the Inner Circle. The club has appeared in two X-Men animated series (&quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; and &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;), both times being renamed as simply The Inner Circle, due to the aversion of using the term &quot;hellfire&quot; in a children&#x27;s cartoon. Members of the Hellfire Club appeared in 2011&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; as the main villains, led by Sebastian Shaw, Emma Frost, Azazel, and Riptide. The Hellfire Club’s Inner Circle also appear as the main antagonists of the second season of the television series &quot;The Gifted&quot; led by a character named Reeva Payge played by Grace Byers, and the Frost sisters played by Skyler Samuels.

==Publication history==
In creating the Hellfire Club, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne drew heavily upon a 1966 episode of the British spy series &quot;The Avengers&quot; entitled &quot;A Touch of Brimstone&quot;. In the episode, agents John Steed and Emma Peel attempt to infiltrate a secret society named after the Hellfire Club of the 18th century, whose members of the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; wear period costumes. Emma Peel&#x27;s guise as &quot;the Queen of Sin&quot;, dressed in a black leather corset, would be the model for the Club&#x27;s Queens, and her first name borrowed for White Queen Emma Frost. The leader of the episode&#x27;s club was played by actor Peter Wyngarde, best known for his role as Jason King, forming the basis for Mastermind&#x27;s new &quot;Jason Wyngarde&quot; identity.

Claremont and Byrne similarly drew the names and faces of the other Hellfire Club members from famous actors: Sebastian Shaw was based on actor Robert Shaw, Harry Leland on Orson Welles (who acted as Harry Lime in &quot;The Third Man&quot; and whose film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; featured a reporter named Jed Leland), and Donald Pierce was based on Donald Sutherland (the surname alluding to his Hawkeye Pierce character from &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;).

Later writers would add references to &quot;The Avengers&quot;: Sir Patrick and Lady Diana, from the Philadelphia branch of the 1780s, are named after actors Patrick Macnee (John Steed) and Diana Rigg (Mrs. Emma Peel); conversely, the Black Queen of the London branch was revealed to be named Ms. Emma Steed.

==Overview==
The Hellfire Club counts among its members the most famous, wealthy, and influential members of society. Membership is passed on to descendants, and can also be earned through wealth or influence. While many accept the invitation simply for the pleasures that the Club offers, others seek wealth and influence. In fact, the purpose of the Hellfire Club is to obtain and exert power through politics and economic influence instead of outward conquest and domination. Since its foundation, the Hellfire Club has been involved in wars and assassinations to further the agendas of the Club&#x27;s most powerful members.

The Club has branches in New York City, London, Hong Kong, and Paris; the various branches are all overseen by the Lord Imperial (a position long-held by Sir Gordon Phillips). Unbeknownst to most members is the Club&#x27;s Inner Circle. Originally known as the Council of the Chosen, this secret group formed around Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Buckman, each member assuming the titles of the major chess pieces. As White King, Buckman financed Stephen Lang&#x27;s revived Sentinel program with the assistance of probationary member Sebastian Shaw. Shaw, now Black Bishop, began securing allies within the Club, meeting Harry Leland, Emma Frost, and Donald Pierce, as well as his loyal assistant, Tessa. Buckman, no longer having a use for the dangerously-ambitious Shaw, ordered a Sentinel attack on Shaw and his allies, resulting in the death of Shaw&#x27;s lover, Lourdes Chantel. That night, Shaw and Emma Frost purged the entire Council of the Chosen, remaking it as the Lords Cardinal and appointing themselves Black King and White Queen.

Shaw&#x27;s Inner Circle soon turned their attentions to the X-Men, kidnapping several of their number. Mastermind, as Jason Wyngarde, was made a probationary member pending his subversion of the X-Men&#x27;s Jean Grey. Jean Grey was in fact the Phoenix, a god-like cosmic entity who became unstable after Mastermind&#x27;s psychic manipulations, turning into the Dark Phoenix. The Hellfire Club had failed, and the X-Men had taken their toll: Phoenix had driven Mastermind insane, Colossus had crippled Donald Pierce and Wolverine nearly killed Harry Leland and several guards.

Despite such setbacks, the Inner Circle continued to pursue its agenda. Shaw, using his connections to Senator Robert Kelly to initiate Project: Wideawake, secured a government contract for Shaw Industries to manufacture Sentinels, profiting from the state of fear concerning the &quot;mutant menace&quot; despite secretly being a mutant himself. Frost meanwhile ran the Massachusetts Academy, a prestigious preparatory school affiliated with the Hellfire Club that secretly trained a team of young mutants, known as the Hellions. The Inner Circle also underwent some personnel changes, notably the expulsion of Donald Pierce for conspiring against his mutant colleagues, and the addition of Selene as Black Queen.

Although the hierarchy of the Inner Circle goes through constant upheaval due to the competing egos and political motives of its members, it continues to exist in the same basic structure today.

Magneto briefly took the title of Grey King after Sebastian Shaw was voted out of the Inner Circle, and with Emma Frost he began plotting against Black Queen Selene, having planted Hellion Empath into Nova Roma via his relationship with New Mutant Magma prior to ousting Shaw. However, when Magneto discovered the X-Man Rogue alive and well in the Savage Land (where Magneto was visiting), Magneto abandoned the Hellfire Club and ultimately went into exile when he was rejected by Rogue when he murdered the Savage Land priestess Zaladane. Meanwhile, Emma Frost attempted to force former Hellion Firestar to rejoin the Hellions but was rebuked by Firestar and her new teammates in the New Warriors.

Disjointed, Selene exploited the chaos to launch a pre-emptive strike to slaughter the Lord Cardinals with aid from a group of young mutant &quot;Upstarts&quot; who were loyal to Selene. Points for each kill were awarded by the Gamesmaster and Magneto, Shaw, Pierce, and Frost were all targeted, before Selene herself was betrayed by Trevor Fritzroy and Gamemaster. During this time the Inner Circle of the London branch was working behind the American branch&#x27;s back and was influencing Parliament and the secret government agency &quot;Black Air&quot;. Captain Britain (Brian Braddock) held a position for a short term on Shinobi Shaw&#x27;s advisement to investigate its activities as they had mutual objectives. Excalibur collected evidence of their crimes and the Inner Circle was either arrested or went into hiding.

The Upstarts&#x27; uprising was quashed by Sebastian Shaw. He reinstated some of the old Inner Circle until he disbanded it due to his own invested interest in business pursuits. The Club still continued loosely partly due to Selene&#x27;s influence, although it never had the same prestige as the original.

Sebastian Shaw again reformed a variation of the original Inner Circle with a nobler outlook posing as a force for good, which may have been a deception on his part. Tessa/Sage rejoined the Inner Circle to observe this and to assist Roberto da Costa&#x27;s usurping the position of Lord Imperial which Shaw had claimed.

The Hellfire Club was next under the leadership of Roberto da Costa as the Lord Imperial aided by Sage. Sat-Yr-9 (under the guise of Courtney Ross) as the new White Queen, aided by her assassin Viper, her &quot;Warrior White Princess&quot;. As with many members in the past, both Sat-Yr-9 and Viper have their own personal agendas.

Following M-Day, Sunspot remains as Lord Imperial, while Shaw resumes his activities, though under Sunspot&#x27;s close watch. While Sat-Yr-9&#x27;s whereabouts remain unknown, Viper returns to Madripoor to oversee HYDRA operations and Sage became a member of the short-lived New Excalibur, only to end up as one of the Exiles.

When the X-Men and many other powered or depowered mutants came to San Francisco, an offshoot of the Club, known as the Hellfire Cult, begins attacking mutants and &quot;species traitors&quot;. Officially, their leadership appears to be Empath, but the real power behind the scenes is the mysterious Red Queen. Their activities draw the attention of the X-Men.

Kade Kilgore later took control of the Hellfire Club. Kilgore founded the Hellfire Academy where he recruited mutant outlaws as its faculty and started looking for students to attend this school. The Hellfire Academy serves as the direct opponent for the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.

==Organization==

===Lord Imperial===
The Lord Imperial is not a member of the Inner Circle or any particular branch of the Hellfire Club; the Lord Imperial is the true leader of the Hellfire Club and oversees all branches of it. As such, only a few individuals have held the title. Sir Gordon Phillips, while unknown at the time, ruled as Lord Imperial for most of the club&#x27;s modern history, holding the position from before the club&#x27;s introduction until his death: killed by Sabertooth on a cruise ship filled with humans infected with the Legacy Virus.

* Sir Gordon Phillips
* Elias Bogan
* Sebastian Shaw
* Roberto da Costa (Sunspot)

===Inner Circle===
The constant intrigue, backstabbing, blackmailing and politicking that plague the Hellfire Club have resulted in many changes of the Inner Circle, as new players seek out membership in order to obtain influence, power and wealth. The following lists the membership of each incarnation of the Inner Circle and the title they held; in descending order of rank are Kings and Queens, followed by Bishops and Rooks.

====The Council of the Chosen====
The original Inner Circle (existing prior to the club&#x27;s introduction) consisted of:

* Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Buckman - White King
* Paris Seville - White Queen
* Sebastian Shaw - Black Bishop

Sebastian Shaw was instrumental in the Hellfire Club&#x27;s funding of Stephen Lang&#x27;s resurrected Sentinel program, but having completed his purpose, White King Ned Buckman sought to eliminate the ambitious Black Bishop. After a Sentinel attack on Shaw&#x27;s beach house resulted in the death of his lover, Lourdes Chantel, Shaw and his ally Emma Frost purged the entire Council in one night and appointed themselves its Black King and White Queen.

====The Lords Cardinal====
Shaw renamed The Council of the Chosen as The Lords Cardinal following his takeover of the New York branch, and appointed a number of allies to key positions. Frost began running the Massachusetts Academy at this time. Jason Wyngarde, also known as Mastermind, later became a probationary member pending his subversion of the X-Men&#x27;s Jean Grey into the Club&#x27;s Black Queen.

* Sebastian Shaw - Black King
* Emma Frost - White Queen
* Donald Pierce - White Bishop
* Harry Leland - Black Bishop
* Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind) - A probationary member who was presumably intended for one of the two Rooks.
* Phoenix (posing as Jean Grey) - Black Queen
* Tessa - Shaw&#x27;s personal aide.
* Warhawk - Associate of the Hellfire Club.

Following Mastermind&#x27;s failed subversion of Jean Grey, the title of Black Queen was once again empty. Donald Pierce reached the rank of White King but was later expelled for conspiring against his mutant colleagues. New members appointed during this period were:

* Selene: - Black Queen
* Friedrich Von Roehm - Black Rook
* Emmanuel da Costa - White Rook

A truce between the Hellfire Club and the X-Men began after an encounter with Nimrod resulted in the deaths of Leland and von Roehm. This truce soon grew into a formal alliance as Storm and Magneto, as the leaders of the X-Men and Xavier&#x27;s school respectively, took over the shared position of White King.

* Storm - White King (with Magneto)
* Magneto - White King, later Grey King

Storm and the X-Men would later seemingly die, leaving Magneto alone to deal with the Inner Circle. After a protracted power struggle, Magneto turned Emma Frost and Selene against Shaw and expelled him from Inner Circle, assuming both mantles as the new Grey King. Magneto, while never formally resigning, would soon withdraw from the club, after relocating to Savage Land to deal with the threat of the villainess Zaladane. Meanwhile, Selene would turn against Frost and Magneto after learning that the two had sent Empath (one of Emma&#x27;s students) to Selene&#x27;s Amazon fortress Nova Roma in order to subvert Selene&#x27;s granddaughter Magma. Selene would create &quot;The Upstarts&quot;, a group of young and wealthy mutants who replace the Hellfire Club. Organizing a &quot;game&quot; where whichever member killed the most Hellfire Club members would rule the group, Emma Frost&#x27;s students in the Hellfire Club were slaughtered by Trevor Fitzroy and Emma herself put into a coma. Fitzroy also &quot;killed&quot; Donald Pierce and his Reavers. Magneto meanwhile, having relocated to Asteroid M, invited a young healer named Fabian Cortez and his group known as the Acolytes to stay with him. Cortez (whose power was to boost other mutants abilities) manipulated Magneto into declaring war upon the X-Men and ultimately hijacked control over a SHIELD orbital weapons platform, to blow up Asteroid M, seemingly killing Magneto. Sebastian Shaw would be &quot;killed&quot; by Shinobi Shaw, a young mutant who was fathered by Harry Leland but raised by Sebastian as his son. In retaliation, Empath used his powers to manipulate all of Nova Roma (including Magma) into thinking they were kidnapped victims of Selene&#x27;s, who had been manipulated due to her mind control powers, into thinking they were citizens of an ancient, long lost Roman settlement in South America. Selene however, would soon fall prey to her new allies own wrath as Trevor Fitzroy and Selene&#x27;s ally, the Gamemaster, turned against her and allowed Gamemaster to take control over the Upstarts.

White Rook Emmanuel da Costa was also killed around this period, though his death was unrelated to the agenda of the Upstarts. A group of immortal mutants known as the Externals, became aware of a prophecy that one of the New Mutants was destined to play a major role in the salvation of the planet. The prophecy referenced two New Mutants in particular, de Costa&#x27;s son Sunspot and the New Mutant Cannonball, one of which potentially possessed the secondary mutation of immortality and the destiny of savior of mutantkind. As Cable infiltrated the New Mutants under the notion that Cannonball was to be the immortal messiah, the External&#x27;s leader Gideon sought to corrupt Sunspot, who was the messiah promised in the prophecy. Already a family friend, Gideon had de Costa&#x27;s secretary poison the White Rook in order to force his super-hero son to leave the New Mutants and take leadership of his family&#x27;s company. When Cannonball survived a near fatal impaling (which Cable mistook as being the result of his being immortal), Gideon turned on Sunspot who was ultimately rescued by X-Force.

With exception of de Costa; all of the Hellfire Club Lord Cardinals killed by the Upstarts, later recovered. Sebastian Shaw faked his death, as did Magneto. Donald Pierce was rebuilt by Stryfe along with the rest of the Reavers, while Emma Frost recovered from her coma and repented her evil ways.

====Shinobi Shaw&#x27;s Upstart Inner Circle====
Selene had originally planned on creating a new Inner Circle with the help of the Upstarts - among them Shinobi Shaw, son of Sebastian Shaw - but they betrayed and imprisoned her. Believing to have successfully assassinated his father, Shinobi Shaw briefly took over the New York branch of the Club, seemingly with support from the External Candra. He offered membership in his Inner Circle to Archangel, Storm, and Sunspot (also known as Roberto da Costa, son of former White Rook Emmanuel da Costa), but all declined.

* Shinobi Shaw - Black King
* Benedict Kine - White King
* Benazir Kaur - White Queen
* Reeva Payge - Black Queen
* Candra - Associate
* Cordelia Frost - Probationary member
* Ebon Knights - Shinobi Shaw&#x27;s Black Guard
* Ivory Knights - Benedict Kine&#x27;s White Guard

The titles of Payge and Kaur are not established. When Cordelia Frost (younger sister of Emma) applies for membership to the Inner Circle, Shinobi states that the title of White Queen is already taken.

Shinobi Shaw&#x27;s actions as Black King were limited to failed attempts at extending his influence and monitoring the London branch of the Club.

====The London Branch====
The Hellfire Club&#x27;s London branch is introduced briefly operating parallel to Shinobi&#x27;s Inner Circle. Instead of Black and White, the titles of the London Inner Circle are designated Black and Red.

* Emma Steed - Black Queen
* Margali Szardos - Red Queen
* Quentin Templeton - Black King
* Alan Wilson - Red King
* Brian Braddock (Captain Britain) - Black Bishop
* Conrad Strathdee - Red Bishop
* Jane Hampshire (possessed by Mountjoy) - Red Rook
* Rutledge - Servant

Captain Britain, having inherited club membership from his father, Sir James Braddock, was asked by Shinobi Shaw to infiltrate the London Inner Circle, as the branch&#x27;s mysterious agenda surely ran counter to both their interests. The London Branch and their plans were soon brought to an end after a failed attempt to use a demon&#x27;s essence to control the city. The Black Queen and Red King were taken into police custody.

====Shaw&#x27;s Second Circle====
Sebastian Shaw, despite his apparent death, later re-emerged and retook control of the Hellfire Club in attempt to restore its former power and glory. Selene, freed from her imprisonment by the Upstarts, took under her influence a resurrected Madelyne Pryor in her quest for revenge. Shaw meanwhile attempted to ally with the AOA-exile Holocaust. Meeting in New York, Shaw proposes a reformation of the Inner Circle with the following line-up: At first operating in secret from outside the Hellfire Club (still under Shinobi Shaw&#x27;s control), Sebastian&#x27;s group soon reasserted control over the organization.

* Sebastian Shaw - Black King
* Selene - Black Queen
* Trevor Fitzroy - White Rook
* Madelyne Pryor - Red Queen
* Donald Pierce - Applicant for White Bishop
* Tessa - Shaw&#x27;s personal aide
* Ella - Selene&#x27;s personal servant
* Holocaust - Associate
* Miss Hoo - Associate

Selene&#x27;s mind control over Madelyne Pryor eventually waned, and the Black Rook&#x27;s allegiance soon turned to Sebastian Shaw. Concerned, Selene contacted Fitzroy and Tessa to counteract the changing balance of power. Donald Pierce returned to the Hellfire Club as a probationary member, however his failure in attaining the alien technology of Apocalypse resulted in his expulsion from the group. Pryor meanwhile had betrayed and deserted the club. Shaw, presented with a mysterious offer, decided to accept its terms and resign from the Inner Circle, advising Fitzroy to do the same.

====Selene&#x27;s Hellfire Club====
Selene, finding herself the sole remaining member of the Inner Circle, reformed the club in her own image and allied with the ruler of Hell, Blackheart. After a confrontation with the Fantastic Four, Blackheart is imprisoned and Selene&#x27;s captive Daimon Hellstrom is freed; Hellstorm then became the club&#x27;s White King to ensure a balance of power and light. Selene would later successfully induct Sunspot (Roberto da Costa, son of former Black Rook Emmanuel da Costa) into the Inner Circle, offering the resurrection of his long-dead girlfriend, Julianna, who died saving his life.

* Selene - Black Queen
* Blackheart - Black King
* Daimon Hellstrom - White King
* Roberto da Costa (Sunspot) - Black Rook

It is unknown what led to the dissolution of this incarnation. The Hellfire Club was found closed and abandoned, covered in blackbriar thorns; Selene herself was trapped inside the mansion, unable to leave.

====The Fifth Inner Circle====
After the death of Sir Gordon Phillips at the hands of the Brotherhood of Mutants, Sebastian Shaw positioned himself as the new Lord Imperial and, as such, oversaw the entire Hellfire Club.

* Sebastian Shaw - Lord Imperial
* Roberto da Costa (Sunspot) - Black King
* Selene - Black Queen
* Sat-Yr-9 (as Courtney Ross) - White Queen
* Viper - White Warrior Princess
* Tessa - Shaw&#x27;s personal aide and Sunspot&#x27;s personal adviser.
* Red Lotus - Associate

Selene, despite remaining imprisoned underneath the Hellfire Club&#x27;s New York mansion and not actively participating in the Inner Circle, has apparently retained her title of Black Queen. It was also revealed that Emma Frost, despite having left the club long ago and having since joined the X-Men, still retained her membership and White Queen title. Sat-Yr-9 confronts Emma Frost and, assuming her title, becomes the newest addition to the Inner Circle, bringing with her bodyguard and self-appointed &quot;White Warrior Princess&quot; Viper.

A confrontation with Donald Pierce leaves Sebastian Shaw gravely injured, and Sunspot takes over as Lord Imperial, which was Tessa&#x27;s plan all along. Tessa left the Club, still under Sunspot&#x27;s rule, and joined New Excalibur in the wake of M-Day. Shaw has since returned as the Black King, seemingly plotting to rebuild his power base.

During the same period, Sat-Yr-9 sends Viper to command an attack on Zanzibar, which she does with the help of the piratical militia the Weaponeers. However, Viper is betrayed by the Weaponeers and makes a truce with mutants from the rebuilding nation of Genosha against her former allies.

====Nova&#x27;s Inner Circle====
* Emma Frost
* Sebastian Shaw
* Perfection
* Cassandra Nova
* Negasonic Teenage Warhead

A mysterious new Inner Circle emerged in the pages of &#x27;Astonishing X-Men&#x27; vol. 3. Members of this version were never given titles, since they were revealed to be psionic projections created by Emma Frost at the behest of Cassandra Nova. In an attempt to free herself from confinement by the X-Men, Cassandra had placed a portion of her consciousness in Frost&#x27;s prior to being mentally imprisoned, and launched an assault on the X-Mansion using Emma as a Trojan horse. Other than Nova, each member appears to represent a different aspect of Emma&#x27;s past, with Negasonic Teenage Warhead being a former student of hers who died in Genosha; Perfection, a manifestation of Emma&#x27;s younger, evil self; and Sebastian Shaw representing her time with the Hellfire Club.

====Selene&#x27;s second Inner Circle====
Selene, finding herself once again the sole remaining member of the Inner Circle, and disappointed by the many betrayals from Sebastian Shaw and his Hellfire Club, decided it was time to rise to goddesshood, a state she believed she was destined for. To accomplish that, she specifically recruited a Coven of deadly mutants to seek revenge against all those that had betrayed her or stood in her way in the past. Together they went to the New York branch of the Hellfire Club, where she cut all ties with them by using her new Inner Circle to slaughter every person there. This Inner Circle was made up of mostly by mutants whose abilities were designed for killing. Membership consisted of:

* Blink 
* Senyaka
* Mortis
* Wither
* Eli Bard - only non-mutant member. Turned into a vampire-like creature by Selene.

====The Sixth Inner Circle====
Sebastian Shaw&#x27;s Inner Circle eventually reemerged. Wolverine came into confrontation with a new &quot;Inner Circle&quot;, under the false impression (by Sebastian Shaw and &quot;Miss Sinister&quot;) that they are behind the kidnapping of his son, Daken.

* Sebastian Shaw
* Claudine Renko (Miss Sinister)
* Mr. Castlemere
* Turner
* Peter Scholl (Leonine)
* Mercedes

====The Seventh Inner Circle====
In the event &quot;Schism&quot;, there has apparently been a pro-human coup in the Hellfire Club, all mutant members have been removed, and 12-year-old supergenius Kade Kilgore has been named the new Black King. Kilgore then called together a cabal of prepubescent geniuses to secretly rule the Hellfire Club and eradicate mutantkind, then proceeding to poison the other remaining Hellfire Club members, making them the sole leadership. Kade Kilgore later had a change of heart and began recruiting mutants to his side to train the newly manifested mutants at the Hellfire Academy. The Hellfire Academy is destroyed by the staff of the Jean Grey School.

* Kade Kilgore - Black King. A twelve-year-old sociopath who is also the leader of the group. 
* Doctor Maximilian Frankenstein (formerly Baron Maximilian von Katzenelnbogen) - Black Bishop. Descendant of Victor Frankenstein. He was responsible for creating the Krakoa that the X-Men befriended and the Krakoas that defended the unnamed island where the Hellfire Academy is located.
* Manuel Enduque - White King. He is well-versed in weaponry with his family reportedly being a dynasty of slavers in Africa with Manuel having strangled his own father to death, thus resulting in him taking control of the business.
* Wilhemina Kensington - White Queen. She is an eleven year old with a love of martial arts and beauty pageants who inherited the company after her mother died. She is also both psychopathic and sociopathic, having killed human guards and alien warriors and is also alleged to have mutilated both cats and penguins.

; Associates:
* Sabretooth
* Ezekiel Stane 
* Kid Blackheart 
* Cordelia Frost
* Szandor Shaw
* Kevin Krask
* Kenneth Krask
* Wolfgang von Roehm

====The Eighth Inner Circle====
Sebastian Shaw has since regained control of the Hellfire Club and in an attempt to restore its former power and glory, decided to ally himself with Magneto and his X-Men branch to form a new Inner Circle.

* Sebastian Shaw - Black King
* Briar Raleigh - Black Bishop - Magneto&#x27;s former associate and the only non-mutant within the Inner Circle
* Monet St. Croix - White Queen
* Black Tom Cassidy - White Bishop

====The Ninth Inner Circle====
Eventually Emma Frost decided to rid of Shaw, by spiking his wine with a paralytic agent she made sure there was no way for him to release his body&#x27;s absorbed energies which overloaded his Mothervine-induced secondary mutation, resulting in his death. She then reformed the Inner Circle in her image and using Vanisher as her personal transportation, she worked behind the scenes to get the X-Men to handle certain affairs.

*Black King: Emma Frost
*White King: Mystique
*Black Bishop: Elixir
*Black Rook: Marrow

====The Tenth Inner Circle====
With mutants congregating on Krakoa, Kade Kilgore is able to retake control of the Hellfire Club branch in New York City. Opting later to rename themselves as &quot;Homines Verendi&quot;, a Latin name which roughly translates to &quot;man must be revered and feared&quot;, Kade and his group (Maximilian Frankenstein, Manuel Enduque and Wilhemina Kensington) recruited Taiwanese millionaire and anti-mutant activist, Chen Zhao and stands poised ready to tear down the new age of mutantkind as they are involved in the Krakoans&#x27; problems.

With each of the founding members already in possession of massive fortunes, they succeeded in taking over Madripoor, an island in Southeast Asia, and are using it as its base of power. While it is unknown whether or not the royal family of Madripoor has been detained, fled or simply murdered, it&#x27;s clear that the lawless island is no longer a safe haven for mutants. Once used as a base of operations for the X-Man Wolverine while using the alias “Patch,” Madripoor has now degenerated into a country that is openly hostile toward mutants and has even gone so far as to offer its citizens payment for killing mutants. It&#x27;s almost become a dark reflection of Krakoa and everything that it stands for and recruited long-time X-Men foe Donald Pierce to act as Madripoor’s official representative to the United Nations.

They also secretly aid Hellfire Club member Sebastian Shaw in the murder of Kitty Pryde. Shaw paid Verendi to participate in his scheme to get Kitty alone on Verendi&#x27;s ship so that he could ensnare her in Krakoan vines and sink her with the ship.

* Kade Kilgore - Black King
* Manuel Enduque - White King
* Chen Zhao - White Bishop
* Maximilian Frankenstein - Black Bishop
* X-Cutioner
* Donald Pierce 
* Hate-Monger
* Yellowjacket/Darren Cross

In &quot;Runaways&quot; #10, Emma Frost tells Cyclops that the Hellfire Club had once reached out for the Hayeses, though the attempt went awry because the Hayeses were &quot;sadistic monsters&quot;.

===Staff===
The Hellfire Club has employed a large number of mostly-anonymous armed guards. A few have been named:

* Wade Cole
* Angelo Macon
* Murray Reese
* Samuel Guthrie (Cannonball)
* Richard Salmons
* Randall Chase
* Chet Andrews

Cole, Macon and Reese were savagely wounded by Wolverine in the Hellfire Club&#x27;s first confrontation with the X-Men. They would return to duty as cyborgs before leaving the Club to join Lady Deathstrike in seeking revenge against Wolverine, eventually joining the Reavers. Sam Guthrie worked as a Hellfire guard for a brief period before joining the New Mutants as Cannonball. Kade Kilgore also recruited two survivors of private military company Blackguard, who were augmented with adamantium skeletons, and laser claws as his personal bodyguards.

The Hellfire Club also employs a number of servants, escorts and strippers. Sharon Kelly was a waitress at the New York branch who was chosen by Sebastian Shaw to seduce Senator Robert Kelly. The couple quickly married, but soon afterwards Sharon was killed in a battle involving the X-Men, further fueling her husband&#x27;s hatred for mutants.

===Massachusetts Academy===

The Hellfire Club was aligned with the prestigious prep school the Massachusetts Academy, run by White Queen Emma Frost, for a number of years. In addition to its large, traditional, student body, the Academy secretly trained a team of young mutants known as the Hellions. Due to their affiliation with the Club, the Hellions were often present at its social functions. This group would entertain a rivalry with Professor Charles Xavier&#x27;s students at the time, the New Mutants.

After the death of the Hellions in an attack orchestrated by the Upstarts, Emma Frost left the Hellfire Club. Re-aligning herself with Professor Xavier, the Massachusetts Academy became the new site for Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters and a new class, known as Generation X.

===Hellfire Academy===
The seventh incarnation of the Hellfire Club have since founded the Hellfire Academy, a rival to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. It is located on an unnamed island. According to Kade Kilgore, the purpose of recruiting newly empowered mutants is to train them to be supervillains so he can then profit from the fear generated by them through his Sentinel program. Staff outside the Hellfire Club&#x27;s leadership include:

===Hellfire Trading Company===
In the wake of the establishment of the mutant nation of Krakoa in the 2019 series &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;, Emma Frost reforms the Club and reorganized it into the Hellfire Trading Company, the distribution arm for the Krakoan drugs produced by the mutant nation-state. Sailing out of Hellfire Bay, its ships the Marauder, the Upstart and the Mercury perform public delivery of mutant goods, while also smuggling the drugs illicitly and freeing mutants from unfriendly nations. The company is run by a new Inner Circle which is compose of a triple dynasty of black, white and red Hellfire royalty.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate universe known as the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, the Hellfire Club was not active and was possibly decimated by the forces of Apocalypse. Its closest counterpart was Heaven, Warren Worthington III&#x27;s nightclub that formed a neutral zone from the genetic conflict that boiled outside. Sebastian Shaw meanwhile served as a member of Apocalypse&#x27;s court. Donald Pierce also became a servant of Apocalypse, and lead the techno-organic-infected Reavers. On the other side of the conflict, Emma Frost served as part of the Human High Council, having been stripped of her powers through a lobotomy. Jason Wyngarde, a victim of the Sugar Man&#x27;s genetic experiments, had become one of Forge&#x27;s Outcasts.

After the ascension of Weapon X, Sebastian Shaw remade Heaven into his image and renamed the nightclub as Hellfire Club all the while trying to gain power.

===Bishop&#x27;s Future===
The Hellfire Club retained its position as one of the world&#x27;s major powers in the future timeline of Bishop. The Club is ruled by Anthony Shaw, a descendant of Sebastian Shaw; he also has an illegitimate son, Trevor Fitzroy. (Fitzroy would later travel back in time, bringing him into conflict with his forefathers Shinobi and Sebastian Shaw.) Malcolm, a colleague of Bishop and member of the Xavier Security Enforcers (X.S.E.), was also a member of the Club.

===Clan Hellfire===
In a future dominated by Trevor Fitzroy, calling himself The Chronomancer, one of the forces opposing his rule is Clan Hellfire, led by a Samara Shaw.

===X-Men: Ronin===
In one alternate reality in which the X-Men are based in Japan, the Hellfire Club is ruled by Professor Xavier. The White Queen Emma Frost is a junior member who, along with Tessa, believe Xavier to be their biological father. The Club controls the Shadowcat Clan of ninjas, which includes Pyro, Iceman and Colossus.

===Marvel Noir===
In &quot;X-Men Noir&quot;, the Hellfire Club is an exclusive S&amp;M club owned by Sebastian Shaw, and is plundered early on by Beast, Cyclops and Iceman.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, the modem Hellfire Club is led by Sebastian Shaw (with other notable members being Xavier spy Gerald Lavine, and Shaw&#x27;s son Shinobi) who worship a pagan &quot;Phoenix God&quot; dating back to its foundation and ties to Egyptian lore. Believing the Phoenix to be incarnated in the body of X-Man Jean Grey, the Club quietly funded Professor Charles Xavier as she developed under his tutelage. Jean however underwent a mental breakdown, and stole the Inner Circle&#x27;s bank access codes and wiped their minds.

A group called the Church of Shi&#x27;ar Enlightenment later approached the Xavier Institute, claiming the Hellfire Club was a breakaway sect, and asking to examine whether or not Jean really is the Phoenix God. However, Lilandra&#x27;s assistant Lavine was revealed to be an operative of the Hellfire Club and working for Shinobi Shaw, who is also dating Emma Frost, headmistress of the Academy of Tomorrow and secretly a member of the Hellfire Club.

<text>The Hitachi Hatsukaze (初風, Hatsukaze - fresh wind), also known as the Hitachi GK4 (short Navy), Hitachi Army Type 4 110hp Air Cooled Inline (Army long), Hitachi Ha47 (Army Hatzudoki) and Ha-11 model 11 (unified), was Hitachi&#x27;s fourth design in a series of aircraft engines built in Japan prior to and during World War II. The original Hatsukaze was a license-built Hirth HM 504. Hatsukaze engines were air-cooled, four-cylinder, inverted inline engines developing around 82 kW (110 hp).

==Design and development==
Hatsukaze engines were produced in very large numbers, as the powerplant for the license-built Bücker Bü 131 &quot;Jungmann&quot; variants that were the standard primary trainers for the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army.

The naval version of the engine was designated GK4, the army version as Ha47.

The &quot;Hatsukaze Model 12&quot; was the power section linked to a compressor to create a primitive jet engine called a motorjet; the resulting Ishikawajima Tsu-11 was intended to power Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka Model 22 flying bombs. The standard Hatsukaze Model 11 engine was modified at a Navy arsenal by replacing the propeller drive shaft and engine front crankcase cover with a step-up gearbox. The gearbox increased engine output shaft RPM at a 1:3 ratio. At engine speed of 3,000 rpm, the compressor section was operating at 9,000 rpm. The compressed air was then ducted into a combustion chamber where a liquid fuel was sprayed and burnt. The heated compressed air then exits through the tailpipe providing static thrust of . It is likely that about 1/3 of the total thrust was contributed by adding the combustion chamber aft of the compressor.

The Tsu-11 was also selected to power the Yokosuka MXY9 Shuka (&quot;Autumn Fire&quot;), a trainer intended to prepare pilots for the Mitsubishi J8M rocket-powered interceptor. Neither of these aircraft entered service, however, as their development took place too late in the war.

<text>Aeroperú Flight 603 (PL603/PLI603) was a scheduled passenger flight from Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida, to Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport in Santiago, Chile, with stopovers in Quito, Ecuador, and Lima, Peru. On October 2, 1996, the Boeing 757-23A aircraft flying the final leg of the flight crashed into the Pacific Ocean. There were no survivors among 70 people on board.

Flying over water, at night, with no visual references, the pilots were unaware of their true altitude, and struggled to control and navigate the aircraft. The investigation determined that the air data computers were unable to show correct airspeed and altitude on cockpit displays because a maintenance worker had failed to remove tape covering the pitot-static system ports on the aircraft exterior prior to departure.

== Background ==

=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft, a Boeing 757-23A, was delivered new from Boeing on 2 December 1992, to leasing company Ansett Worldwide (AWAS). It was leased to Aeroméxico on 27 September 1993 and then sub-leased to Aeroperú on April 1, 1994. The lease transferred back to AWAS in February 1995, and Aeroperú continued to operate the aircraft until it crashed.

=== Crew ===
The captain was 58-year-old Eric Schreiber Ladrón de Guevara, who had logged almost 22,000 flight hours (including 1,520 hours on the Boeing 757). The first officer was 42-year-old David Fernández Revoredo, who had logged almost 8,000 flight hours, with 719 of them on the Boeing 757.

== Accident ==
On October 1, 1996, Aeroperú Flight 603 from Miami International Airport had landed at the Lima Airport. There were 180 passengers on the first leg of the flight on a Boeing 757. Of those, 119 had exited the plane, and the remaining passengers were transferred to another Boeing 757.

This aircraft took off 42 minutes after midnight (05:42 UTC) on October 2, and the crew immediately discovered that their basic flight instruments were behaving erratically, and reported receiving contradictory serial emergency messages from the flight management computer, including the altitude and airspeed indicator, rudder ratio, mach speed trim, overspeed, underspeed and flying too low. The crew declared an emergency and requested an immediate return to the airport.

The pilots incorrectly believed that they could figure out the actual aircraft altitude by asking the controller, but neither the pilots nor the controller realized that the altitude information displayed on the controller&#x27;s screen was sent from the aircraft&#x27;s Mode C Transponder. As the transponder was receiving the same erroneous altitude information being displayed on the aircraft&#x27;s altimeter, the altitude on the controller&#x27;s display was also incorrect.

Faced with a lack of reliable basic flight instrument readings, constant contradictory warnings from the aircraft&#x27;s flight computer (some of which were valid and some of which were not) and believing that they were at a safe altitude, the crew decided to begin descent for the approach to the airport. Since the flight was at night over water, no visual references were available to convey to the pilots their true altitude or to aid their descent. As a consequence of the pilots&#x27; inability to precisely monitor the aircraft&#x27;s airspeed or vertical speed, they experienced multiple stalls, resulting in rapid loss of altitude with no corresponding change on the altimeter. While the altimeter indicated an altitude of approximately , the aircraft&#x27;s true altitude was much lower.

The air traffic controller instructed a Boeing 707 to take off and to help guide the 757 in to land, but it was too late. The 757&#x27;s left wingtip clipped the water approximately 25 minutes after the emergency declaration, tearing off a part of the left wing. The pilots desperately clawed for altitude and managed to get the 757 airborne again for 19 seconds, but due to the damage to the left wing the aircraft rolled over and slammed into the water near-inverted. All 70 passengers and crew died.

== Passengers ==
About half of the passengers on the flight were Chileans returning to Chile.
Of the passengers, 21 originated from Miami; all of the originating passengers were Chilean. An additional 10 passengers had boarded in Quito. The remaining passengers had boarded in Lima.

==Aftermath==

After the accident, Aeroperú changed the number of its evening Miami-Lima-Santiago Boeing 757 service to Flight 691.

=== Search, rescue, and recovery ===
After the crash, recovery crews found nine bodies floating, but 61 bodies had sunk with the aircraft.

=== Investigation ===
The Commission of Accident Investigations (CAI) of the Director General of Air Transport (DGAT) of Peru wrote the final accident report.

The chief Peruvian accident investigator, Guido Fernández Lañas, was the uncle of the co-pilot, David Fernández. There were some reservations about the potential conflict of interest, but the National Transportation Safety Board-appointed investigator, Richard Rodriguez, determined that Fernández Lañas could properly investigate the accident.

The Peruvian Navy collected the floating wreckage. After the Peruvian authorities asked for assistance, the United States Navy provided equipment to locate the underwater wreckage of the Boeing 757 and retrieve its flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.

Later investigation into the accident revealed that adhesive tape had been accidentally left over some or all of the static ports (on the underside of the fuselage) after the aircraft was cleaned and polished, eventually leading to the crash. Employee Eleuterio Chacaliaza had left the tape on by mistake.

The static ports are vital to the operation of virtually all of those flight instruments that provide basic aerodynamic data, such as airspeed, altitude and vertical speed, not only to the pilots but also to the aircraft&#x27;s computers, which provide additional functions, such as warnings when flight characteristics approach dangerous levels. The blockage of all of the static ports is one of the few common-failure modes resulting in total failure of multiple basic flight instruments and, as such, is regarded as one of the most serious faults that can occur in avionics systems.

The design of the aircraft did not incorporate a system of maintenance covers for the static ports. Such covers are commonly employed in aviation for blocking access to critical components when the aircraft is not in operation and are generally a bright color and carry flags (which may have &quot;remove before flight&quot; markings). Instead, the design of the aircraft and the relevant maintenance procedure called for the use of adhesive tape to cover the ports.

As a result of the blocked static ports, the basic flight instruments relayed false airspeed, altitude and vertical speed data. Because the failure was not in any of the instruments, but rather in a common supporting system, thereby defeating redundancy, the erroneous altimeter data was also broadcast to air traffic control, which was attempting to provide the pilots with basic flight data. This led to extreme confusion in the cockpit as the pilots were provided with some data (altitude) which seemed to correlate correctly with instrument data (altimeter) while the other data provided by ATC (approximate airspeed) did not agree. Although the pilots were quite cognizant of the possibility that all of the flight instruments were providing inaccurate data, the correlation between the altitude data given by ATC and that on the altimeter likely further compounded the confusion. Also contributing to their difficulty were the numerous cockpit alarms that the computer system generated, which conflicted both with each other and with the instruments. This lack of situational awareness was revealed by the cockpit voice recorder transcript. That the flight took place at night and over water, thus not giving the pilots any visual references, was also identified as a major factor. The official accident report concluded that the flight crew, distracted by the conflicting warnings, did not heed the radar altimeter reading after descending through .

===Legal settlement===
Mike Eidson, an American attorney, represented 41 passengers and crew in a lawsuit contending that the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturer, Boeing, bore responsibility for the disaster, as the company ought to have foreseen the misuse of its products. The suit was filed against Boeing in federal court in Miami in May 1997. According to the complaint, the flightdeck errors were caused by careless maintenance by Aeroperú and negligence and defective design by Boeing. Boeing argued that it was not at fault, and that responsibility for the accident lay with the employee who did not remove the tape from the static ports, and the aircraft&#x27;s pilot for not noticing the tape still applied by visual check. Richard Rodriguez of the NTSB said that it was understandable that Schreiber did not find the tape because the maintenance worker had used duct tape instead of the brightly colored tape that he was supposed to use. In addition, Rodriguez said that the pitot-static ports were high above the ground, meaning that Schreiber could not have seen the tape against the fuselage. After extensive litigation, the parties agreed to transfer the case against Boeing and Aeroperú to an international arbitration in Santiago, for a determination of the damages. The defendants agreed to not contest liability in Chile.

On December 13, 1999, family members of the flight&#x27;s passengers received one of the largest compensations stemming from an aviation accident outside the United States aboard a non-U.S. carrier, averaging nearly $1 million per victim. &quot;Mayday&quot; stated that the manner of the crash resulting in the passengers&#x27; drowning was responsible for the large settlements.

=== Criminal prosecution ===
Chacaliaza was convicted in Peru for negligent homicide and given a two-year suspended sentence in 1998. Four other defendants were acquitted. Chacaliaza said he would appeal the ruling, claiming that sabotage brought down the plane and that he had removed the adhesive tape.

Peruvian air accident investigator Guido Fernández criticized the ruling, stating that the maintenance worker was relatively uneducated and had little understanding of what he did. Fernández argued that his supervisors bore more responsibility, yet Chacaliaza was the one prosecuted by the system.

<text>Emilio Cándido Portes Gil (; 3 October 1890 – 10 December 1978) was President of Mexico from 1928 to 1930, one of three to serve out the six-year term of President-elect General Álvaro Obregón, who had been assassinated in 1928. Since the Mexican Constitution of 1917 forbade re-election of a serving president, incumbent President Plutarco Elías Calles could not formally retain the presidency. Portes Gil replaced him, but Calles, the &quot;Jefe Máximo&quot;, retained effective political power during what is known as the Maximato.

==Early life and education==
Portes Gil was of Dominican descent and was born in Ciudad Victoria, the capital of the state of Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico. He was a relative of Trina de Moya, a Dominican poet and former first lady of the Dominican Republic.

Although his grandfather had been a prominent politician in Tamaulipas, Portes Gil&#x27;s father died when Emilio was young. He lived with his widowed mother in straitened circumstances, but a state grant helped Portes Gil receive certification as a schoolteacher. He sought to study law.

==Early career==
He was in law school during the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution and in late 1914, he allied himself with &quot;First Chief&quot; Venustiano Carranza, head of the Constitutionalist faction, who would assume the presidency of the country the following May. When Portes Gil graduated from law school in 1915, he had already begun his career in the public administration with a posting in the Constitutionalist faction&#x27;s Department of Military Justice.

Portes Gil became part of the Northern leadership of the Constitutionalist Army, particularly Álvaro Obregón, who had defeated Pancho Villa&#x27;s forces and eliminated them as a political or military factor in Mexico after 1915. Key to his subsequent political career was Sonoran general Plutarco Elías Calles. Portes Gil demonstrated skills as a lawyer and administrator, which catapulted him into the presidency of Mexico when Obregón was assassinated in 1928.

Over the ensuing years, he continued to serve the government in both a legal capacity –(supreme state court judge in Sonora; legal advisor to the Ministry of War) and in elective office: he was elected to Congress in 1917, 1921, and 1923, and he served as governor of his native Tamaulipas on two occasions (1920 and 1925).

==Presidency==

Between 28 August and 30 November 1928, he was Minister of the Interior (Gobernación) in the cabinet of Plutarco Elías Calles. When president-elect Álvaro Obregón was assassinated on 17 July 1928 by a Catholic opponent, a political solution to the crisis that did not include Calles returning to the presidency was necessary. Portes Gil, with the agreement of Calles, assumed office as interim president for a period of 14 months, when fresh elections were called.

Portes Gil inherited a widespread religious rebellion, the Cristero War, which Calles had provoked by aggressively enforcing anticlerical laws. As president, Portes Gil secretly negotiated the end to the conflict between the Catholic Church and the Mexican government, which created a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; that lasted decades. He had reassured the Catholic Church that its officials could petition congress to amend laws that it found to be offensive and that the government would not interfere with its internal operations. The government also granted a general amnesty to Cristero fighters.
In 1929 Paramahansa Yogananda, founder of Self-Realization Fellowship, spent two months in Mexico, during which time President Portes Gil hosted the great guru. President Portes Gil afterwards became a longtime admirer of Yogananda’s teachings and later served as ambassador to India. 

Faced with a university strike, he defused the situation by convening a special session of Congress, which ultimately enacted the legislation granting autonomy to the National University of Mexico. His settling the strike is one of the acts for which he is best remembered as president.

He also attempted to negotiate the withdrawal of the United States troops from Nicaragua, in exchange for the surrender of Nicaraguan General Augusto Sandino. When the talks failed, he granted Sandino political asylum in Mexico and a parcel of land in Temixco.

Portes Gil attempted to steer government officials away from self-enrichment during their terms of office. He wanted his office-holders to &quot;know how to be loyal to institutions, and like the country want the triumph of the Revolution.&quot;

His administration embarked on public works projects building schools, hospitals, and housing for the benefit of ordinary Mexicans. In Mexico City, a new hospital for tuberculosis patients was inaugurated; the physical plant of the National Preparatory School, housed in the colonial-era Colegio de San Ildefonso, was expanded; a major sports center open to all, built on a former city dump; and new police and fire stations built in Art Deco design.

==Later life==
He handed on the presidential sash to Pascual Ortiz Rubio on 5 February 1930, but effective power still remained in the hands of Calles. Portes Gil later served for 18 months as interior minister.

He subsequently traveled to Europe as Mexico&#x27;s first representative to the League of Nations. Under later presidents, he served in various capacities, including ambassador to India, foreign minister, attorney-general, and president of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (National Revolutionary Party).

In 1933, Lázaro Cárdenas was chosen as the party&#x27;s official candidate for the 1934 presidential elections. Calles attempted to retain his own power as he had endeavored to do throughout the Maximato, but Cárdenas outmaneuvered Calles politically and eventually exiled him from Mexico. Cárdenas put Portes Gil in charge of purging the party of Callista elements. Since Portes Gil was &quot;one of the &#x27;puppet presidents&#x27; so unceremoniously dumped by Calles, [Portes Gil] was happy to serve.&quot;

Cárdenas reorganized the party as the Partido de la Revolución Mexicana (PRM), setting the structural form of sectoral representation that its 1946 successor retained, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Cárdenas, however, returned Portes Gil to his stronghold in Tamaulipas once the former president had performed his task since the latter had &quot;attempted to build up his own position for a possible political comeback.&quot;

Portes Gil retired from politics in 1936. In 1964, he attended the inauguration of President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. He died of a heart attack in Mexico City in 1978, at the age of 88.

<text>Sing As We Go is a 1934 British musical film starring Gracie Fields, John Loder and Stanley Holloway. The script was written by Gordon Wellesley and J. B. Priestley.

Considered by many to be British music hall star Gracie Fields&#x27; finest vehicle, this film was written for her by leading novelist J. B. Priestley. In this morale-boosting depression movie, set in the industrial north of England, Fields stars as a resourceful, determined working class heroine, laid off from her job in a clothing mill, who has to seek work in the seaside resort of Blackpool. This gives her the opportunity both to fall into many misadventures and, of course, to sing.

The decision to film on location brings the film a life and immediacy all too absent from most films of the period. The film provides us with a snapshot of life in a seaside resort in the 1930s. The final scene of the millworkers returning to the re-opened mill while Fields leads them in the rousing title song has become an almost iconic film cliché.

==Main cast==
* Gracie Fields as Gracie Platt 
* John Loder as Hugh Phillips 
* Dorothy Hyson as Phyllis Logan 
* Stanley Holloway as Policeman 
* Frank Pettingell as Uncle Murgatroyd Platt 
* Lawrence Grossmith as Sir William Upton 
* Morris Harvey as The Cowboy 
* Arthur Sinclair as The Great Maestro 
* Maire O&#x27;Neill as Madame Osiris 
* Ben Field as Nobby 
* Olive Sloane as Violet - The Song-Plugger&#x27;s Girlfriend 
* Margaret Yarde as Mrs. Clotty 
* Evelyn Roberts as Parkinson 
* Norman Walker as Hezekiah Crabtree
* Florence Gregson as Aunt Alice

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Film&quot; gave the film three stars out of five and described &quot;Sing As We Go&quot; as a &quot;dated but spirited musical comedy...amusing and politically astute&quot;.

By contrast, in &quot;The Making of Modern Britain&quot;, Andrew Marr singled out &quot;Sing As We Go&quot; as an icon of British pop culture of the 1930s, concluding: &quot;Fairy tale or not, this is probably the worst film I have ever seen.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*The main theme of this movie, the song &quot;Sing As We Go&quot; (written by Harry Parr Davies), is one of two signature songs of The Kampen Janitsjarorkester Symphonic Band of Kampen, Oslo, Norway.
* The melody of the song was used by the comedy group Monty Python in a parody song called &quot;Sit on My Face&quot;.

<text>The Exocet () is a French-built anti-ship missile whose various versions can be launched from surface vessels, submarines, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.

==Etymology==
The missile&#x27;s name was given by M. Guillot, then the technical director at Nord Aviation. It is the French word for flying fish, from the Latin &quot;exocoetus&quot;, a transliteration of the Greek name for the fish that sometimes flew into a boat: (&quot;exōkoitos&quot;), literally &quot;lying down outside (, ), sleeping outside&quot;.

==Description==

The Exocet is built by MBDA, a European missile company. Development began in 1967 by Nord as a ship-launched weapon named the MM38. A few years later, Aerospatiale and Nord merged. The basic body design was based on the Nord AS-30 air-to-ground tactical missile. The sea-launched MM38 entered service in 1975, whilst the air-launched AM39 Exocet began development in 1974 and entered service with the French Navy five years later in 1979.

The relatively compact missile is designed for attacking small- to medium-size warships (e.g., frigates, corvettes, and destroyers), although multiple hits are effective against larger vessels, such as aircraft carriers. It is guided inertially in mid-flight and turns on active radar homing late in its flight to find and hit its target. As a countermeasure against air defence around the target, it maintains a very low altitude while inbound, staying just one to two meters above the sea surface. Due to the effect of the radar horizon, this means that the target may not detect an incoming attack until the missile is only from impact. This leaves little time for reaction and stimulated the design of close-in weapon systems (CIWS).

Its solid propellant rocket motor gives the Exocet a maximum range of . It was replaced on the Block 3 MM40 ship-launched version of the missile with a solid-propellant booster and a turbojet sustainer engine which extends the range of the missile to more than . The submarine-launched version places the missile inside a launch capsule.

Replacement Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon is under development.

===Versions===
The Exocet has been manufactured in versions including:
* MM38 (surface-launched) – deployed on warships. Range: 42 km. No longer produced. A coast defence version known as &quot;Excalibur&quot; was developed in the United Kingdom and deployed in Gibraltar from 1985 to 1997.
* AM38 (helicopter-launched – tested only)
* AM39 (air-launched) – B2 Mod 2: deployed on 14 types of aircraft (combat jets, maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters). Range between 50 and 70 km, depending on the altitude and the speed of the launch aircraft.
* SM39 (submarine-launched) – B2 Mod 2: deployed on submarines. The missile is housed inside a watertight launched capsule (&quot;véhicule Sous marin,&quot; VSM), which is fired from the submarine&#x27;s torpedo tubes. On leaving the water, the capsule is ejected and the missile&#x27;s motor is ignited. It then behaves like an MM40. The missile will be fired at depth, which makes it particularly suitable for discreet submarine operations.
* MM40 (surface-launched) – Block 1, Block 2 and Block 3: deployed on warships and in coastal batteries. Range: 72 km for the Block 2, in excess of 200 km for the Block 3.
* SM40 (submarine-launched), deployed on submarines, is the successor of the EXOCET SM39. 

===MM40 Block 3===
In February 2004, the Direction Générale pour l&#x27;Armement (DGA) notified MBDA of a contract for the design and production of a new missile, the MM40 Block 3. It has an improved range, in excess of through the use of a Microturbo TRI-40 turbojet engine, and includes four air intakes to provide continuous airflow to the power plant during high-G manoeuvres.

The Block 3 missile accepts GPS guidance system waypoint commands, which allow it to attack naval targets from different angles and to strike land targets, giving it a marginal role as a land-attack missile. The Block 3 Exocet is lighter than the previous MM40 Block 2 Exocet.

45 Block 3 Exocets were ordered by the French Navy in December 2008 for its ships which were carrying Block 2 missiles, namely &quot;Horizon&quot;-class and &quot;Aquitaine&quot;-class frigates. From 2021, the Block 3 upgrade was also being extended to three of the La Fayette-class frigates selected for life extension refits. These are not to be new productions but the conversion of older Block 2 missiles to the Block 3 standard. An MM40 Block 3 last qualification firing took place on the Île du Levant test range on 25 April 2007 and series manufacturing began in October 2008. The first firing of the Block 3 from a warship took place on 18 March 2010, from the French Navy air defence frigate . In 2012, a new motor, designed and manufactured in Brazil by the Avibras company in collaboration with MBDA, was tested on an MM40 missile of the Brazilian Navy.

Besides the French, the Block 3 has been ordered by several other navies including that of Greece, the UAE, Chile, Peru, Qatar, Oman, Indonesia and Morocco.

The chief competitors to the Exocet are the US-made Harpoon, the Turkish Atmaca, the Italian Otomat, Israel Gabriel-V, the Swedish RBS 15 and the Chinese Yingji series.

===MM40 Block 3c===

The “Block 3c” variant integrates a digital Radio Frequency (RF) seeker to the missile that has been developed by Thales. The Block 3c variant is described as more resistant to jamming systems and may be able to recognize surface vessels, based on the use of advanced wave forms. Block 3 missiles introduced a longer 200 kilometer range but retained the same RF seeker as Block 2. This technology remained non-digital.

The Block 3c variant is to begin delivery to the French Navy in December 2022 with 55 new missiles ordered in addition to 45 “MM40 Block 3c kits” to update existing Block 3 missiles to the Block 3c configuration. In September 2023, tests of the missile conducted by the frigate &quot;Alsace&quot; confirmed the variant as ready for operational service.

==Operational history==
===Falklands War===
In 1982, during the Falklands War, Argentine Navy Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard warplanes carrying the AM39 air-launched version of the Exocet caused damage which sank the Royal Navy destroyer on 4 May 1982. Two more Exocets struck the 15,000-ton merchant ship on 25 May. Two MM38 ship-to-ship missiles were removed from the destroyer ARA &quot;Seguí&quot;, a former US Navy destroyer, and transferred to an improvised launcher for land use. The missiles were launched on 12 June 1982 and one hit the destroyer .

====HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot;====
&quot;Sheffield&quot; was a Type 42 guided missile destroyer. On 4 May 1982, Sheffield was at defence watches (second-degree readiness) the southernmost of three Type 42 destroyers when she was hit by one of two AM39 air-launched Exocet missiles fired by Argentine Super Étendard strike fighters. The second missile splashed into the sea about half-mile off her port beam.

The missile that struck &quot;Sheffield&quot; impacted on the starboard side at deck level 2, travelling through the junior ratings&#x27; scullery and breaching the Forward Auxiliary Machinery Room/Forward Engine Room bulkhead above the waterline, creating a hole in the hull roughly . It appears that the warhead did not explode. Twenty members of her crew were killed and 26 injured. The ship foundered while under tow on 10 May. The loss of &quot;Sheffield&quot; was a deep shock to the British public and government.

The official Royal Navy Board of Inquiry Report stated that evidence indicates that the warhead did not detonate. During the four and a half days that the ship remained afloat, five salvage inspections were made and a number of photographs were taken. Members of the crew were interviewed and testimony was given by Exocet specialists (the Royal Navy had 15 surface combat ships armed with Exocets in the Falklands War). There was no evidence of an explosion, although burning propellant from the rocket motor caused fires which could not be checked as firefighting equipment had been put out of action.

==== SS &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; ====
&quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was a 14,950 ton roll-on/roll-off container ship that had been hastily converted to carry aircraft on her deck. She was carrying helicopters and supplies, including cluster bombs. Two Exocet missiles had been fired at a frigate, but had been confused by its defences and re-targeted the &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;. Both missiles struck the container ship on her port quarter and warheads exploded either after penetrating the ship&#x27;s hull, or on impact. Witness Prince Andrew reported that debris caused &quot;splashes in the water about a quarter of a mile away&quot;. Twelve men were killed and the survivors were taken to HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;. &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; sank while under tow three days later. 

==== HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; ====
On 30 May, two Super Étendards, one carrying Argentina&#x27;s last remaining air-launched Exocet, escorted by four Douglas A-4C Skyhawks, each with two 500 lb bombs, took off to attack the carrier HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;. Argentine intelligence had sought to determine the position of &quot;Invincible&quot; from analysis of aircraft flight routes from the task force to the islands. However, the British had a standing order that all aircraft conduct a low level transit when leaving or returning to the ship to disguise her position. This tactic compromised the Argentine attack, which focused on a group of escorts 40 miles south of the main body of ships. Two of the attacking Skyhawks were shot down: one by a Sea Dart missile fired by HMS &quot;Exeter&quot;, and while the fate of the Exocet has never been established beyond doubt, the crew of HMS &quot;Avenger&quot; claimed that their 4.5-inch gun had shot it down. No damage was caused to any British vessels.

==== HMS &quot;Glamorgan&quot; ====
&quot;HMS Glamorgan&quot; was a destroyer launched in 1964. On 12 June 1982 an MM38 Exocet missile was fired from an improvised shore-based launcher as she was steaming at about offshore. The first attempt to fire a missile did not result in a launch; on the second attempt, a missile was launched but did not acquire the target. The third attempt resulted in a missile tracking &quot;Glamorgan&quot;. The incoming Exocet missile was also spotted on &quot;Glamorgan&quot; and a turn was ordered to present the stern to the missile.

The turn prevented the missile from striking the ship&#x27;s side and penetrating the hull; instead, it hit the deck coaming at an angle, near the port Seacat missile launcher, skidded along the deck and exploded, making a hole in the hangar deck and a hole in the galley below. The blast travelled forwards and down, and the missile body, still travelling forwards, penetrated the hangar door, causing the ship&#x27;s fuelled and armed Westland Wessex HAS.3 helicopter (XM837) to explode and start a severe fire in the hangar. Fourteen crew members were killed.

==== Post–Falklands war ====
In the years after the Falklands War, it was revealed that the British government and the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) had been extremely concerned at the time by the perceived inadequacy of the Royal Navy&#x27;s anti-missile defences against the Exocet and the missile&#x27;s potential to tip the naval war decisively in favour of the Argentine forces. A scenario was envisioned in which one or both of the force&#x27;s two aircraft carriers ( and ) were destroyed or incapacitated by Exocet attacks, which would make recapturing the Falklands much more difficult.

Actions were taken to contain the Exocet threat. A major intelligence operation was initiated to prevent the Argentine Navy from acquiring more of the weapons on the international market. The operation included British intelligence agents claiming to be arms dealers able to supply large numbers of Exocets to Argentina, who diverted Argentina from pursuing sources which could genuinely supply a few missiles. France denied deliveries of Exocet AM39s purchased by Peru to avoid the possibility that Peru might supply them to Argentina because they knew that payment would be made with credit from the Central Bank of Peru. British intelligence had detected the guarantee was a deposit of two hundred million dollars from the Andean Lima Bank, an owned subsidiary of the Italian Banco Ambrosiano.

===Iran–Iraq War===

Exocet missiles were used by Iraq mainly as part of the Tanker War, the Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon, Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard and Dassault Mirage F1 were aircraft used by Iraq to launch the missiles.

During the Iran–Iraq War, on 17 May 1987, an Iraqi aircraft identified as a Mirage F1 (but was in fact a modified Dassault Falcon 50) fired two Exocet missiles at the American frigate . Both missiles struck the port side of the ship near the bridge. No weapons were fired in defence: The Phalanx CIWS remained in standby mode and the Mark 36 SRBOC countermeasures were not armed. Thirty-seven United States Navy personnel were killed and twenty-one were wounded. The ship did not sink, and was eventually repaired.

<doc id="398393" wikidata="Q790616" url="?curid=398393" title="Brown shrike">
<text>The brown shrike (Lanius cristatus) is a bird in the shrike family that is found mainly in Asia. It is closely related to the red-backed shrike (&quot;L. collurio&quot;) and isabelline shrike (&quot;L. isabellinus&quot;). The genus name, &quot;Lanius&quot;, is derived from the Latin word for &quot;butcher&quot;, and some shrikes are also known as &quot;butcher birds&quot; because of their feeding habits. The specific &quot;cristatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;crested&quot;, used in a broader sense than in English. The common English name &quot;shrike&quot; is from Old English &quot;scríc&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot;, referring to the shrill call.

Like most other shrikes, it has a distinctive black &quot;bandit-mask&quot; through the eye and is found mainly in open scrub habitats, where it perches on the tops of thorny bushes in search of prey. Several populations of this widespread species form distinctive subspecies which breed in temperate Asia and migrate to their winter quarters in tropical Asia. They are sometimes found as vagrants in Europe and North America.

==Taxonomy==
In 1747 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the brown shrike in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Crested Red, or Russit Butcher-Bird&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a specimen that had been sent from Bengal to the silk-pattern designer Joseph Dandridge in London. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the brown shrike with the other shrikes in the genus &quot;Lanius&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Lanius cristatus&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The specific epithet is Latin meaning &quot;crested&quot; or &quot;plumed&quot;.

Four subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;L. c. cristatus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – central, east Siberia and north Mongolia, India to the Malay Peninsula
* &quot;L. c. confusus&quot; Stegmann, 1929 – east Mongolia, southeast Russia and northeast China Malay Peninsula and Sumatra
* &quot;L. c. lucionensis&quot; Linnaeus, 1766 – east China, Korean Peninsula and south Japan southeast China, Philippines, Borneo and Sulawesi
* &quot;L. c. superciliosus&quot; Latham, 1801 – the island of Sakhalin (southeast Russia) and north, central Japan southeast China and east Indochina to the Lesser Sunda Islands

==Description==

This shrike is mainly brown on the upper parts and the tail is rounded. The black mask can be paler in winter and has a white brow over it. The underside is creamy with rufous flanks and belly. The wings are brown and lack any white &quot;mirror&quot; patches. Females tend to have fine scalloping on the underside and the mask is dark brown and not as well marked as in the male. The distinction is not easy to use in the field but has been tested with breeding birds in Japan where the female can be identified from the presence of a brood patch. The use of multiple measurements allows discrimination of the sex of about 90% of the birds. Subspecies &quot;lucionensis&quot; has a grey crown shading into the brown upperparts and the rump appears more rufous than the rest of the upper back. The tail is more brownish and not as reddish as in the red-backed shrike. Younger birds of &quot;lucionensis&quot; have a brown crown and lack the grey on the head. Subspecies &quot;superciliosus&quot; has a broad white supercilium and a richer reddish crown. The tail is redder and tipped in white.

A number of confusing forms are known from central Asia where the populations of &quot;cristatus&quot;, &quot;isabellinus&quot; and &quot;collurio&quot; overlap. The taxonomy has been in a state of flux and some forms such as &quot;phoenicuroides&quot; formerly considered as subspecies of &quot;L. cristatus&quot; have been moved to the species &quot;L. isabellinus&quot;. Subspecies &quot;lucionensis&quot; has been recorded interbreeding with &quot;superciliosus&quot; in Ishikawa, Japan while &quot;superciliosus&quot; has interbred with &quot;Lanius tigrinus&quot; in central Japan.

==Distribution==
The nominate form breeds in northern Asia from Mongolia to Siberia and winters in South Asia, Myanmar and the Malay Peninsula. The race &quot;confusus&quot; described from the same region is not well marked but is said to have a wider white brow and paler upperparts and is sometimes included within the nominate population. Subspecies &quot;superciliosus&quot; (sometimes called the Japanese shrike) breeds on the islands of Sakhalin, Kuril and Japan and winters in Hainan, Sumatra, Java, and the Sundas. Subspecies &quot;lucionensis&quot;, sometimes known as the Philippine shrike (local names: &quot;tarat&quot; or &quot;pakis-kis&quot;), breeds in Korea and eastern China wintering mainly in Taiwan and the Philippines but also on the Andaman Islands and in peninsular India. Stuart Baker suggested that the species may breed in the Cachar Hills of Assam but the idea was questioned by Claud Buchanan Ticehurst.

This species is rare in Europe and vagrants have been recorded in the United States and Canada.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The brown shrike is a migratory species and ringing studies show that they have high fidelity to their wintering sites, often returning to the same locations each winter. They begin establishing wintering territories shortly after arrival and their loud chattering or rattling calls are distinctive. Birds that arrive early and establish territories appear to have an advantage over those that arrive later in the winter areas. The timing of their migration is very regular with their arrival in winter to India in August and September and departure in April. During their winter period, they go through a premigratory moult. Their song in the winter quarters is faint and somewhat resembles the call of the rosy starling and often includes mimicry of other birds. The beak remains closed when singing and only throat pulsations are visible although the bird moves its tail up and down while singing.

The breeding season is late May or June and the breeding habitat includes the taiga, forest to semi-desert where they build a nest in a tree or bush, laying two to six eggs.

They feed mainly on insects, especially Lepidoptera. Like other shrikes, they impale prey on thorns. Small birds and lizards are also sometimes preyed upon. A white-eye (&quot;Zosterops&quot;) has been recorded in its larder. They typically look out for prey from a perch and fly down towards the ground to capture them.

<text>The Russian Naval Infantry (), often referred to as Russian Marines in the West, operate as the naval infantry of the Russian Navy. Established in 1705, they are capable of conducting amphibious operations as well as operating as more traditional light infantry.

The Naval Infantry also fields the Russian Navy&#x27;s only special operations unit, known as the ‘commando frogmen’. Frogmen are typically drawn from the Naval Infantry&#x27;s ranks, and they are capable of a wide range of special operations tasks and missions. Colloquially, Russian-speakers may refer to Naval Infantrymen using the abbreviation морпехи (morpekhi (plural), singular form: морпех (morpekh)).

The first Russian marine force formed in 1705, and since that time it has fought in the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War (1853–1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), the First World War (1914–1918) and the Second World War (1939–1945). Under Admiral Gorshkov (Soviet Navy Commander-in-Chief from 1956 to 1985), the Soviet Navy expanded the reach of the Naval Infantry and deployed it worldwide on numerous occasions.

Since 2019 Lieutenant General Viktor Astapov has commanded the Naval Infantry in his capacity as the Deputy Commander for Coastal Troops/Commandant of the Coastal Troops of the Russian Navy.

The Naval Infantry, alongside the Coastal Defense Missile Artillery Forces, form part of a larger institution—the Coastal Troops of the Russian Navy (, &quot;Beregovye voyska VMF Rossii&quot;).

==History==

Little is known about the Russian Naval infantrymen during the Imperial era of Russia because many of the units formed consisted of supernumerary ship crews of destroyed or immobilised Russian warships.

The history of the Russian Navy could be traced back to the 16th century with Ivan the Terrible with the formation of his special team of Streltsy &quot;sea soldiers&quot; as part of his crew of flotilla ships.

The official history of the Naval Infantry could be traced back to the creation of the Russian ship Oryol (lit., Eagle), which launched in 1668 &amp; sailed with a crew of 23 sailors &amp; 35 soldiers, with the soldiers duties of boarding &amp; capturing enemy ships &amp; providing sentinel service under the command of Ivan Domozhirov.

During the Azov campaign of the Russo-Turkish War, under Peter the Great, the soldiers in these units; many of whom were recruited by the Preobrazhensky &amp; the Semyonovsky Regiments of the later-to-become Imperial Guards, were shown to be particularly effective in carrying out those duties. Those soldiers would later on form the Russian Navy&#x27;s very first infantry regiment consisting of 4300 men.

The first admiral of the regiment was appointed by no less than Tsar Peter I himself, General Admiral Fyodor Golovin, who later gave the respective order to Vice Admiral Cornelius Kruys on November 16, 1705, marking the glorious years following for the Russian Naval Infantry.

In November 16 (27), 1705, following a decree of Peter I, the first regiment &quot;of naval equipage&quot; () (or in other words, equipped and supplied by the Russian Imperial Navy) was formed for boarding and landing operations, on the ships of the Baltic Fleet. The regiment had 1200 men (two battalions of five companies; 45 officers, &amp; 70 non-commissioned officers), and from this original regiment began the long history of Naval Infantry within Russia.

===Great Northern War===
In 1714, the regiment won a victory against the Swedes during the Battle of Gangut. However, after the war, a review of the Regiment&#x27;s performance during the war concluded that the regimental organization of the unit did not work with the organizational structure of the Navy&#x27;s fleet and did not allow it to be correctly utilized in combat conditions. As a result, the naval regiment was disbanded, and in replace of it, five naval battalions of consisting of men drawn from the army was created in 1712–1714 &amp; attached to the fleet:

:&quot;Vice Admiral Battalion&quot; - for service in the vanguard squadrons on the ships of the squadron&#x27;s avant-garde;
:&quot;Admiral&#x27;s Battalion&quot; - for service on ships of the squadron center;
:&quot;Rear Admiral Battalion&quot; - for service on the ships of the rear guard of the squadron;
:&quot;Galler Battalion&quot; - for service on combat ships of the Galere fleet; 
:&quot;Admiralty Battalion&quot; - for guard duty and other tasks.

===Russo-Turkish Wars===

The Russian naval infantry were involved in a series of victories against the Ottoman Empire including the rout of the Turkish Navy at the Battle for Cesme Harbor in 1770, and the taking of Izmail Fortress on the Danube, in 1790.
===Napoleonic War===

During the prelude to the war, in 1799 the Russian naval infantry took the French fortress at Corfu after a four-month siege. In 1806, a Russian landing force took Naples by storm and entered the Papal States.
During the War of the Sixth Coalition, the Russian naval infantry distinguished itself against &quot;La Grande Armée&quot; at the Battle of Borodino (1812), Battle of Kulm (1813) and the Siege of Danzig.
===Crimean War===
By 1813, significant parts of the naval infantry were transferred to the Army &amp; subsequently lost naval connections. For almost 100 years, there were no large infantry units in the Russian Navy. Nevertheless, in 1854–1855, during the Siege of Sevastopol against British, French and Turkish troops, there were renewed calls for revival of the military&#x27;s Naval Infantry units. 17 separate sea battalions were formed and they participated in the defense of Sevastopol.

===Early 20th century===
====Russo-Japanese War====
In 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, the naval infantry defended Port Arthur against Japanese forces. Personnel were recruited from regular sailors &amp; naval crews to make up the numbers. Seven separate naval rifle battalions, a separate landing squad of sailors, three separate sea rifle companies and several machine-gun teams were formed.
====World War I====
The question of the formation of permanent Naval Infantry Units were raised only in 1910 and in 1911, projects were underway under the Chief Naval Staff for the development of permanent infantry units in the main naval bases of the country: an infantry regiment under the Baltic Fleet, an infantry battalion in the Black Sea Fleet and the Vladivostok Battalion for the Pacific Fleet.

In August 1914, two separate battalions from the personnel of the Guards Fleet Crew and one battalion of personnel from the 1st Baltic Fleet Crew were created in Kronstadt. In March 1915, a separate naval battalion of the 2nd Baltic Fleet Crew was transformed into the Marine Regiment of Special Purpose. It included a mine company, a machine-gun team, a communications team, regimental artillery, a technical workshop, a convoy, and individual commands of the steamer Ivan-town and boats.

At the end of 1916 and the beginning of 1917, the first two divisions of naval infantry were formed; the Baltic Division and Black Sea Division.

The naval infantry was deployed to the Baltic to defend the homeland against German attack as well as the Caspian Sea for operations against Ottoman forces.

Under the command of Admiral Alexander Kolchak, there was plans for the Black Sea Division to undergo amphibious operations to take the Bosporus and open a naval path to the Mediterranean Sea however, such plans never ended up coming to fruition.
==== Post-Russian Revolutions and the Russian Civil War====
These naval infantrymen, who served under the Navy of the Imperial State, would later on form the core of the naval infantry service of the young Soviet Navy in 1918, which distinguished itself during the long Russian Civil War (1918–1922). Many of their fellow servicemen though supported the White movement and distinguished themselves as part of anti-Soviet military operations during those years. Many were shot upon capture by Soviet authorities. Others were tortured and killed. 

The Soviet Naval Infantry&#x27;s major force during the civil war was the Baltic Fleet Naval Infantry, the ex-Imperial fleet division&#x27;s Communist servicemen would provide much of the fighting power during those years following the Revolution.
===Soviet era===

====Kronstadt rebellion====
Following the winding down of the Russian Civil War by 1920, the following year, many Soviet Naval Infantrymen stationed in Kronstadt mutinied against the Soviet government in 1921. The mutiny was quickly put down by Soviet forces with the mutinying Naval Infantrymen facing retribution by the Soviet government leading to their eventual execution.

====World War II====

During World War II about 350,000 Soviet Navy sailors fought on land operations. At the beginning of the war, the navy had only one naval infantry brigade in the Baltic Fleet, but began forming and training other battalions. These eventually were:
* six naval infantry regiments, comprising two 650 man battalions each,
* 40 naval infantry brigades of 5–10 battalions, formed from surplus ships&#x27; crews. Five brigades were awarded &quot;Gvardiya&quot; (Guards) status,
* On November 1, 1944, the greatly understrength Red Army 55th Rifle Division was converted into a garrison formation for the Porkkala Naval Base after the Moscow Armistice with Finland in late September 1944. 
* plus numerous smaller units

Many of the new units were raised as part of the Black Sea, Pacific and Northern Fleets. The military situation demanded the deployment of large numbers of naval infantry on land, so the Naval Infantry contributed to the defense of Odessa, Moscow, Leningrad, Sevastopol, Stalingrad, Novorossiysk and Kerch.

The Naval Infantry conducted over 114 landings, most of which were carried out by platoons and companies. In general, however, Naval Infantry served as regular infantry, without any amphibious training. They conducted four major operations: two during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, one during the Caucasus Campaign and one as part of the Landing at Moonsund, in the Baltic.

During the war, five brigades and two battalions of naval infantry were awarded Guards status. Nine brigades and six battalions were awarded decorations, and many were given honorary titles. The title Hero of the Soviet Union was bestowed on 122 Naval Infantry servicemen.

The Soviet experience in amphibious warfare in World War II contributed to the development of Soviet operational art in combined arms operations. Many members of the Naval Infantry were parachute trained; they conducted more drops and successful parachute operations than the Soviet Airborne Troops (VDV).

The Naval Infantry was disbanded in 1947, with some units being transferred to the Coastal Defence Force.

====Cold War====

In 1961, the Naval Infantry was re-formed and became a combat arm of the Soviet Navy. Each Fleet was assigned a Naval Infantry unit of regiment (and later brigade) size. The Naval Infantry received amphibious versions of standard armoured fighting vehicles, including tanks used by the Soviet Army.

By 1989, the Naval Infantry numbered 18,000 troops, organised into the 55th Naval Infantry Division at Vladivostok and at least four independent brigades: the 61st &quot;Kirkenneskaya&quot; Brigade at Pechenga (Northern Fleet), 175th at Tumannyy in the North, 336th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade at Baltiysk (Baltic Fleet), and 810th at Sevastopol (Black Sea Fleet).

By the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Navy had over eighty landing ships, as well as two &quot;Ivan Rogov&quot;-class landing ships. The latter could transport one infantry battalion with 40 armoured vehicles and their landing craft. (One of the &quot;Rogov&quot; ships has since been retired.)

At 75 units, the Soviet Union had the world&#x27;s largest inventory of combat air-cushion assault craft. In addition, many of the 2,500 vessels of the Soviet merchant fleet (&quot;Morflot&quot;) could off-load weapons and supplies during amphibious landings.

On November 18, 1990, on the eve of the Paris Summit where the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty and the Vienna Document on Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBMs) were signed, Soviet data were presented under the so-called initial data exchange. This showed a rather sudden emergence of three so-called coastal defence divisions (including the 3rd at Klaipėda in the Baltic Military District, the 126th in the Odessa Military District and seemingly the 77th Guards Motor Rifle Division with the Northern Fleet), along with three artillery brigades/regiments, subordinate to the Soviet Navy, which had previously been unknown as such to NATO.

Much of the equipment, which was commonly understood to be treaty limited (TLE) was declared to be part of the naval infantry. The Soviet argument was that the CFE excluded all naval forces, including its permanently land-based components. The Soviet Government eventually became convinced that its position could not be maintained.

A proclamation of the Soviet government on July 14, 1991, which was later adopted by its successor states, provided that all &quot;treaty-limited equipment&quot; (tanks, artillery and armoured vehicles) assigned to naval infantry or coastal defence forces, would count against the total treaty entitlement.

=== 1989 list of units ===
==== Landing Assault units of the Naval Infantry ====
In addition to the Landing Assault Troops of the Ground Forces similar units were also formed by the Soviet Naval Infantry with the main task to execute airborne landings (by parachute or by helicopters), take over and defend a beachhead for the amphibious landing of the main force. By 1989 these units were organized under their respective Fleet HQs as follows:

Red Banner Northern Fleet - ZATO Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast, RSFSR

* 61st &quot;Kirkenesskaya, Red Banner&quot; Naval Infantry Brigade - Sputnik, Murmansk Oblast, RSFSR
** 876th Landing Assault Battalion 

Twice Red Banner Baltic Fleet - Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad Oblast, RSFSS

* 336th &quot;Guards&quot; &quot;Belostokskaya, Order of Suvorov and the Order of Alexander Nevski&quot; Naval Infantry Brigade - Baltiysk, Kaliningrad Oblast, RSFSS
** 879th Landing Assault Battalion

Red Banner Black Sea Fleet - Sevastopol, Crimean ASSR, Ukrainian SSR

* 810th Naval Infantry Brigade &quot;60th Anniversary of the USSR&quot; - Sevastopol, Crimean ASSR, Ukrainian SSR
** 881st Landing Assault Battalion 

Red Banner Pacific Fleet - Vladivostok, Primorsky Krai, RSFSR

* 55th &quot;Mozyrskaya&quot;&quot;, Order of the Red Banner&quot; 55th Naval Infantry Division - Vladivostok, Primorsky Krai, RSFSR
** 165th Naval Infantry Regiment - Vladivostok, Primorsky Krai, RSFSR
*** One Landing Assault Battalion 
** 390th Naval Infantry Regiment - Slavyanka, Primorsky Krai, RSFSR
*** One Landing Assault Battalion

===Russian Federation===


The Naval Infantry of the Russian Navy includes the 55th Naval Infantry Division of the Russian Pacific Fleet, the independent brigades of the Northern (61st Brigade at Sputnik, Murmansk Oblast) and Baltic Fleets and of the Caspian Flotilla, and the independent regiment of the Black Sea Fleet.

In 1994, Exercise &quot;Cooperation from the Sea&quot; was conducted, in and around Vladivostok, with the U.S. III Marine Expeditionary Force, to foster a closer relationship between the Russian Naval Infantry and the United States Marine Corps. U.S. Marines and Russian naval infantrymen conducted their first exercise on U.S. soil the following year, in Hawaii. &quot;Cooperation From the Sea 1995&quot; was a maritime disaster relief exercise, which included cross training and personnel exchanges, and culminated in a combined U.S. and Russian amphibious landing. The purpose of the exercise was to improve interoperability, cooperation and understanding between U.S. and Russian personnel.

In 1998, the 22nd Motor Rifle Division, Far East Military District, at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatka, was transferred to the Pacific Fleet. In 2000 the division became the 40th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade, and on 1 September 2007 the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade (40 отд. Краснодарско-Харбинская дважды Краснознаменная бригада морской пехоты). In 2013, the regiment became, again, the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade.

From 2000 onwards, the Caspian Flotilla included a new naval infantry brigade, the 77th, based at Kaspiysk. The headquarters and two battalions of the brigade were scheduled to be established by August 1, 2000. It was reported by &quot;Agenstvo Voyenniykh Novostyei&quot; (AVN) in June 2000 that the new brigade, which may have inherited the lineage of the 77th Motor Rifle Division, was to have its troops housed in Kaspiysk and Astrakhan, along with as many as 195 combat vehicles and two hovercraft sent to it from Chukotka and the Northern Fleet, respectively. The brigade was also reported to have had helicopters assigned to it.


====Syrian Civil War====
In early September 2015, it was estimated that approximately 800 Russian Naval Infantrymen had taken up positions all along western Syria with the majority of them being stationed in the mountainous city of Slunfeh in east Latakia – the remaining personnel had been moved to the Homs (Wadi Al-Nasara) and Tartous (Masyaf and Safita) Governorates in preparation for the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War.

On the night of 19 to 20 September 2015, Russian Naval Infantry engaged in a fight with militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) near the city of Latakia. The militants tried to mount an attack on the airbase there, however, they were ambushed by the Naval Infantry. As a result of the clash, three militants were killed, two were captured, and the rest retreated.

Before dawn of 24 September 2015, Russian Naval Infantry went into battle for the first time since their deployment to Syria, Debka file&#x27;s military and intelligence sources reveal. The 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade fought with Syrian Army and Hezbollah special forces in an attack on ISIL forces at the Kweiris air base, east of Aleppo.

In November 2015, a Russian Naval Infantryman was killed during an operation to rescue the crew of a Russian Sukhoi Su-24M bomber aircraft that was shot down by the Turkish Air Force near the Syria–Turkey border.

In March 2016, the 61st Naval Infantry Brigade conducted operations in which it aided the Syrian Army&#x27;s liberation of the Syrian city of Palmyra. The 61st also participated in the storming of the city. Sources consider it one of the best trained and most combat experienced units of the Russian forces.

In mid-May 2016, Russian Naval Infantry helped Syrian forces recapture the initiative in east Homs, while also recovering several points near the Al-Sha’ar Gas Fields and T-4 Military Airport.

In September 2016, it was reported that Russian Naval Infantry were conducting operations on Aleppo&#x27;s Castillo Highway.

==== Russo-Ukrainian War ====
===== Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation =====

Russian Naval Infantry participated in the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

===== War in Donbas (2014–2022) =====

The 61st Naval Infantry Brigade (Russia) participated in the Russo-Ukrainian War in the Luhansk Oblast.

===== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine =====

On 24 February 2022, Russian Naval Infantry started an amphibious assault on the Sea of Azov coast and besieged the city of Mariupol. Ropucha-class landing ship and Ivan Gren-class landing ship capable of landing tanks have reportedly been deployed in the region. The 155th Guards Naval Infantry participated in the Kyiv offensive which was later repelled forcing the Russian forces to retreat to Belarus in April later redeploying to Yehorivka and Pavlivka in the Donbas.

By 9 November 2022, the 155th Guards Naval Infantry and 40th Naval Infantry Brigade participated in an attack on the Ukrainian military garrison in Pavlivka. Members of the unit claimed to have taken roughly 300 casualties, with many of these complaints shared with notable Russian media figures and the unit&#x27;s garrison. The members went further stating the attacks took place due to their commander&#x27;s desire to earn bonuses and distinction through awards. On 15 November 2022, a commander of the Russian-proxy Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic indicated that lower-level commanders within the 155th Guards Naval Infantry disregarded orders in the attack on Pavlivka. 

In December, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the deployment of the 155th Guards Naval Infantry to Pavlivka. Recruits &quot;lacked sufficient food, maps, critical medical supplies, or walkie-talkies, and they were forced to use 1970s-era Kalashnikov rifles — with some members having to resort to using Wikipedia to locate instructions for using certain weapons&quot;. There was also a shortage of ammunition. One soldier said, &quot;This isn&#x27;t war. It&#x27;s the destruction of the Russian people by their own commanders.&quot; Many used their Russian cellphones to call home, enabling Ukraine to track the unit and attack it. Many soldiers were volunteers but had &quot;little experience&quot; regarding the use of firearms.

In January 2023, the 155th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade attempted a breakthrough assault in Vuhledar against the Ukrainian 72nd Mechanized Brigade but failed. The unit saw initial success, however, but according to former FSB colonel Igor Strelkov, their assault stagnated following heavy losses to infantry and lack of ammunition for their organic fire support, despite using their T-80 tanks in an indirect fire role, and &quot;in general-poor technical support for the attacking units and their low staffing.&quot;

==Organization==

The largest naval infantry units are brigades or regiments. A Naval Infantry Regiment consists of roughly 2,000 personnel and is equipped with the PT-76 and BRDM-2, consists of 1 Tank Battalion and 3 naval infantry battalions, one motorised with BTR-60-series amphibious vehicles. brigades are somewhat larger. Although, sizes vary depending on mission and specializations.

Naval Infantry Battalions comprise the backbone of the naval infantry fighting force. The battalion is made up of three naval infantry companies, a mortar platoon, an antitank platoon, and supporting supply and maintenance, medical, and communications units. In all, the battalion numbers about 400 men. This unit, reinforced, constitutes the basic amphibious attack force in the assault landing-the battalion assault force (BAF).

At least one infantry battalion of each regiment or brigade is parachute trained, while all of the remaining infantry battalions are trained to be able to carry out air assault missions.

==Equipment==

 Russian Naval Infantry had been gradually phasing out PT-76 amphibious tanks, and starting to receive a number of T-80s and upgraded BMP-2Ms. A full-strength Naval Infantry Brigade may have up to 80 tanks. The Russian Naval Infantry has 50 T-72B, 150 T-72B3, 30 T-72B3 mod. 2016, 50 T-80BV and 50 T-80BVM as of 2021. The APCs used by the Naval Infantry are either wheeled BTR-80s (in Assault Landing Battalions) or tracked MT-LBs (in Naval Infantry Battalions). Naval Infantry units are receiving BMP-3 IFVs; about 40 were delivered in 2021. BMP-3s may equip one company per Naval Infantry battalion.

According to a Defense Ministry statement published by RIA Novosti in November 2009, &quot;All units of Russia&#x27;s naval infantry will be fully equipped with advanced weaponry by 2015.&quot; Included in this upgrade would be T-90 tanks, BMP-3 IFVs, 2S31 120 mm mortar/artillery tracks, wheeled BTR-82A armored personnel carriers, air defense equipment and small arms. All Naval Infantry units were equipped with Ratnik infantry combat gear and all Northern Fleet naval infantry units were equipped with BTR-82A APCs as of November 2016.

Naval Infantry and Navy units also receive new-technology binoculars. As of 2017 the Naval Infantry had started to receive a modernized version of Strelets reconnaissance, control and communications system and completed receiving D-10 parachutes. All Pacific Fleet and Caspian Flotilla naval infantry units were equipped with BTR-82A APCs as of September 2019. 40 BTR-82A were delivered for the Black Sea Fleet in early 2021. The Pacific Fleet Naval Infantry were armed with &quot;Sectant&quot; small robotic reconnaissance systems in late 2021.

In late February 2014, at least one Black Sea Fleet assigned unit (at company level) was apparently using &quot;Tigr&quot; armored cars near Sevastopol during the annexation of Crimea. In March 2014 imagery emerged of some Naval Infantry personnel carrying what appeared to be the OTs-14-1A-04 7.62×39mm assault rifle with an under-barrel GP-30 40 mm grenade launcher, a bullpup design normally associated with Russian Airborne Troops, as well as Combat Engineering and Spetsnaz units. Naval Infantry of the Caspian Flotilla received modernized 5.45-mm Kalashnikov assault rifles, AK-74M with an &quot;Obves&quot; modernization kit in 2021. The newest anti-landing mine PDM-MD passed state tests in 2019-2020. The Molniya-1 suicide drones with a claimed range of 30 km reportedly started to enter service in July 2024.

The Alligator tank landing ship and more modern Ropucha-class landing ship is a typical amphibious assault ship. Propelled by diesel engines, this ship is relatively small, displacing about 4,500 tons. In 1978, the Soviets launched a new amphibious ship, the &quot;Ivan Rogov&quot;. The advent of the Ivan Rogov was taken in the West as an indication that the Soviet Navy was planning to strengthen the power projection mission of Naval Infantry.

Twice the size of earlier ships, it can launch amphibious vehicles from its open bow doors. It also carries helicopters. Among the various small assault landing vehicles to launch from the bow are hovercraft, such as the &quot;Aist&quot;, which can carry the naval infantry ashore at speeds of fifty knots.

The composition and the class of the main ships:
* 4 units – Alligator-class landing ship
* 12 units – Ropucha-class landing ship + 3 improved Ropucha-class
* 2 units – Zubr-class LCAC + 1 in hold (in More (Feodosiya))
* 5 units – Dyugon-class landing craft 
* 2 units – Ivan Gren-class landing ship

<doc id="398402" wikidata="Q5894952" url="?curid=398402" title="Hong Kong Progressive Alliance">
<text>The Hong Kong Progressive Alliance (HKPA) was a pro-Beijing, pro-business political party in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It was established in 1994 and was merged into the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) in 2005. The DAB then renamed as the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.

==Stances==
The party was composed of mainly businessmen and professionals. The party was considered a pro-business conservative and pro-Beijing one. It assured another voting block in support of Beijing&#x27;s interest. The basic platform of the party was to defend &quot;One country-two systems&quot; and the Basic Law, the mini-constitution of Hong Kong. It advocated handling political and social issues in a moderate, pragmatic and harmonious manner, and the &#x27;progressive&#x27; development of democracy, emphasising &#x27;stability, prosperity and progress&#x27;.

Party members maintained close relationships with Mainland China authorities. A number of them were deputies to the National People&#x27;s Congress and members of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==History==

In July 1994, solicitor Ambrose Lau founded the 52-member Hong Kong Progressive Alliance in the direction of the New China News Agency which consisted of mostly pro-business factor of the CCP&#x27;s united front, the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, the Federation for the Stability of Hong Kong and the New Hong Kong Alliance in preparation for the 1995 Legislative Council Election. Ambrose Lau became the only member won the seat in the election through the Election Committee. It merged with the Liberal Democratic Federation (LDF) in 1997, another pro-business party formed in 1990.

The party won 5 seats in the 1998 election of the Legislative Council, of which 2 were from functional constituencies and 3 were from the election commission. In the 2000 LegCo election, the party won 4 seats (excluding Choy So-yuk who had joined the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) in the election). These included 1 seat each from geographical and function constituencies and 2 from election committee.

With the abolition of the election committee LegCo seats in 2004 election, the HKPA had an internal dispute on whether the party should send members for geographical direct elections. David Chu Yu-lin intended to run for a seat in New Territories East, and began canvassing, but suddenly decided to quit in late July. Tang Siu-tong also declined to run for re-election.

After that the party decided to let Tso Wung-wai to run for the election in New Territories East only, though there was a rumour that an independent candidate in New Territories West, Chow Ping-tim, was actually a member of HKPA. However, some outsiders think that HKPA was insincere in participating in direct elections and the dispute shows the party came to a decline. The party lost all the seats in the Legislative Council in the election.

HKPA merged with the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) on 16 February 2005.

==Members of the party in the Legislative Council==
* Choy Kan-pui
* Choy So-yuk (also a DAB member)
* David Chu Yu-lin
* Hui Cheung-ching
* Ambrose Lau Hon-chuen
* Tang Siu-tong

<doc id="398404" wikidata="Q2503280" url="?curid=398404" title="Lucas number">
<text>The Lucas sequence is an integer sequence named after the mathematician François Édouard Anatole Lucas (1842–1891), who studied both that sequence and the closely related Fibonacci sequence. Individual numbers in the Lucas sequence are known as Lucas numbers. Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers form complementary instances of Lucas sequences. 

The Lucas sequence has the same recursive relationship as the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two previous terms, but with different starting values. This produces a sequence where the ratios of successive terms approach the golden ratio, and in fact the terms themselves are roundings of integer powers of the golden ratio. The sequence also has a variety of relationships with the Fibonacci numbers, like the fact that adding any two Fibonacci numbers two terms apart in the Fibonacci sequence results in the Lucas number in between.

The first few Lucas numbers are 
: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521, 843, 1364, 2207, 3571, 5778, 9349, ... . 

which coincides for example with the number of independent vertex sets for cyclic graphs formula_1 of length formula_2.
== Definition ==
As with the Fibonacci numbers, each Lucas number is defined to be the sum of its two immediately previous terms, thereby forming a Fibonacci integer sequence. The first two Lucas numbers are formula_3 and formula_4, which differs from the first two Fibonacci numbers formula_5 and formula_6. Though closely related in definition, Lucas and Fibonacci numbers exhibit distinct properties.

The Lucas numbers may thus be defined as follows:
:formula_7
(where &quot;n&quot; belongs to the natural numbers)

All Fibonacci-like integer sequences appear in shifted form as a row of the Wythoff array; the Fibonacci sequence itself is the first row and the Lucas sequence is the second row. Also like all Fibonacci-like integer sequences, the ratio between two consecutive Lucas numbers converges to the golden ratio.

==Extension to negative integers==
Using formula_8, one can extend the Lucas numbers to negative integers to obtain a doubly infinite sequence: 
:..., −11, 7, −4, 3, −1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ... (terms formula_9 for formula_10 are shown).
The formula for terms with negative indices in this sequence is
: formula_11

==Relationship to Fibonacci numbers==

The Lucas numbers are related to the Fibonacci numbers by many identities. Among these are the following:
* formula_12
* formula_13
* formula_14
* formula_15
* formula_16
* formula_17, so formula_18.
* formula_19
* formula_20; in particular, formula_21, so formula_22.

Their closed formula is given as:
:formula_23

where formula_24 is the golden ratio. Alternatively, as for formula_25 the magnitude of the term formula_26 is less than 1/2, formula_9 is the closest integer to formula_28 or, equivalently, the integer part of formula_29, also written as formula_30.

Combining the above with Binet&#x27;s formula,

:formula_31

a formula for formula_28 is obtained:

:formula_33

For integers &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2, we also get:

:formula_34

with remainder &quot;R&quot; satisfying

:formula_35.

==Lucas identities==

Many of the Fibonacci identities have parallels in Lucas numbers. For example, the Cassini identity becomes

:formula_36

Also

:formula_37

:formula_38

:formula_39

where formula_40.

:formula_41

where formula_42 except for formula_43.

For example if &quot;n&quot; is odd, formula_44 and formula_45

Checking, formula_46, and formula_47

==Generating function==

Let

:formula_48

be the generating function of the Lucas numbers. By a direct computation,

:formula_49

which can be rearranged as

:formula_50

formula_51 gives the generating function for the negative indexed Lucas numbers, formula_52, and

:formula_53

formula_54 satisfies the functional equation

:formula_55

As the generating function for the Fibonacci numbers is given by

:formula_56

we have

:formula_57

which proves that

:formula_58

and

:formula_59

proves that

:formula_22

The partial fraction decomposition is given by

:formula_61

where formula_62 is the golden ratio and formula_63 is its conjugate.

This can be used to prove the generating function, as

:formula_64

==Congruence relations==

If formula_65 is a Fibonacci number then no Lucas number is divisible by formula_66.

The Lucas numbers satisfy Gauss congruence. This implies that formula_9 is congruent to 1 modulo formula_68 if formula_68 is prime. The composite values of formula_68 which satisfy this property are known as Fibonacci pseudoprimes.

formula_71 is congruent to 0 modulo 5.

== Lucas primes ==

A Lucas prime is a Lucas number that is prime. The first few Lucas primes are
:2, 3, 7, 11, 29, 47, 199, 521, 2207, 3571, 9349, 3010349, 54018521, 370248451, 6643838879, ... .

The indices of these primes are (for example, &quot;L&quot;4 = 7)
:0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 31, 37, 41, 47, 53, 61, 71, 79, 113, 313, 353, 503, 613, 617, 863, 1097, 1361, 4787, 4793, 5851, 7741, 8467, ... .
, the largest confirmed Lucas prime is &quot;L&quot;148091, which has 30950 decimal digits. , the largest known Lucas probable prime is &quot;L&quot;5466311, with 1,142,392 decimal digits.

If &quot;Ln&quot; is prime then &quot;n&quot; is 0, prime, or a power of 2. &quot;L&quot;2&quot;m&quot; is prime for &quot;m&quot; = 1, 2, 3, and 4 and no other known values of &quot;m&quot;.

==Lucas polynomials==
In the same way as Fibonacci polynomials are derived from the Fibonacci numbers, the Lucas polynomials formula_72 are a polynomial sequence derived from the Lucas numbers.

== Continued fractions for powers of the golden ratio ==
Close rational approximations for powers of the golden ratio can be obtained from their continued fractions.

For positive integers &quot;n&quot;, the continued fractions are:
:formula_73
:formula_74.

For example:
:formula_75
is the limit of
:formula_76
with the error in each term being about 1% of the error in the previous term; and
:formula_77
is the limit of
:formula_78
with the error in each term being about 0.3% that of the &quot;second&quot; previous term.

==Applications==
Lucas numbers are the second most common pattern in sunflowers after Fibonacci numbers, when clockwise and counter-clockwise spirals are counted, according to an analysis of 657 sunflowers in 2016.

<doc id="398410" wikidata="Q5165020" url="?curid=398410" title="Contemporary architecture in Cluj-Napoca">
<text>Since 1989, modern skyscrapers and glass-fronted hotels have altered the skyline of Cluj-Napoca, a city in the Transylvanian region of Romania.

==Banks==

The Cluj-Napoca regional headquarters of the Banca Română pentru Dezvoltare (BRD) (Romanian Bank for Development) was completed in 1997 after 4 years of work. It is the second tallest building in Cluj-Napoca (the tallest one being West City Tower), 50 m or 164 feet. Its 12 stories house offices for the bank and for divisions of several other companies, including insurance and oil companies. 

Another architecturally interesting building is the unfinished headquarters of the Banca Agricole (Agricultural Bank), held in the custody of the city due to the failure of that bank and its subsequent purchase by the Reiffeisen Bank. Work ceased in 2000; all that was finished was the exterior, built by the &quot;Abatech&quot; firm. The city government proposed that the building be completed and transformed into the Casa Europei (&quot;House of Europe&quot;), but funds were not obtained to complete work. In 2006, it was announced that the building will completed as a &quot;City Business Center&quot;, and work resumed. Today the building is functional and bears the nickname &quot;Clădirea biscuite&quot;.

Another building in similar straits is the more recently started behind Palatul Telefoanelor (Telephone Palace; a building of the same name exists in Bucharest), built by Romtelecom (the national, public phone company), who could not afford to finish the building and auctioned it off. It was bought by Banca Transilvania for 3 million euros. The financial institution announced it will be used as a &quot;banking café&quot; (Romanian: &quot;cafenea bancară&quot;), the first of its kind in Cluj (however, since the announcement a rival bank, Banc Post, opened such a café).

Other banks that have constructed modern buildings in Cluj-Napoca include Banca Transilvania, Banca Comercială Română, Banc Post, Banca Țiriac, ABN Amro Bank, and UniCredit.

== Other buildings ==
In the more recent years real estate developers have built more buildings as the city experienced economic growth. Iulius Mall opened a big commercial center with a business tower on top in 2007. In 2014 United Business Center was built near Iulius Mall and in Marasti neighborhood a large office complex started being built with the name simply &quot;The Office&quot; which had its phase one completed in 2014 and the entire complex is expected to be finished in 2016.

Many residential buildings started to appear mainly on the city outskirts and in Florești. The most notable area where this is taking place is in Bună Ziua neighborhood.

==Government buildings==

Besides banks, Cluj-Napoca features several modern buildings constructed under the aegis of the local government. The most recent is the Octavian Goga Library Building, which also houses information centers for the European Union and NATO. This building was started in 2000 and completed in 2003. Other post-Communist-era government buildings include the Avram Iancu Firehouse, Cluj-Napoca International Airport, and the Cluj-Napoca branch of DistriGaz.

==Schools==
Being an academic center, home of six government universities (Babeş-Bolyai University, Academia de Arte Vizuale &quot;Ion Andreescu&quot;, Universitatea de Ştiinţe Agronomice şi Medicină Veterinară, Universitatea Tehnică, Universitatea de Medicină si Farmacie, Academia de Muzică &quot;Gheorghe Dima&quot;) and several private ones as well (Universitatea Bogdan Vodă, Universitatea Creştină Dimitrie Cantemir), Cluj-Napoca also features several modern university buildings such as the Department of Political Science at UBB, the Department of Management at UBV, and the Law Department of UCDC.</text><links>

<doc id="398411" wikidata="Q5527241" url="?curid=398411" title="Gateway HandBook">
<text>The HandBook was a very small and lightweight subnotebook originally introduced by Gateway 2000 in 1992. It quickly achieved critical acclaim and a cult-like following, especially in Japan.

It was designed by IQV and Tottori Sanyo and manufactured by Tottori Sanyo in Japan. The lead engineer on the product was Howard Fullmer and other significant contributors included Bob Burnett and Rick Murayama.

The product was only wide, deep, and high, and weighed less than . While it used a Chips and Technologies 8680 microprocessor, it was marketed as having 286-level performance. The C&amp;T chip set included hardware emulation of the Intel 80186 processor and the HandBook used a special feature of the chip set called SuperSet whereby 80286 instructions were trapped and then emulated in software. This same feature was used to emulate the 8051 keyboard controller, serial port and numerous other I/O functions. Intel worked closely with IQV to include similar capabilities in the SL chip sets which were introduced in the mid-90s.

The HandBook had 640 KB of RAM, a 20 MB hard drive, and a monochrome blue-white CGA-compatible display. The unit could be powered by a rechargeable NiMH battery or six AA batteries in a special battery pack. The rechargeable batteries were unusual in that they are able to be charged without actually being in the laptop. A floppy disk was attached through a proprietary parallel port connector. A tremendous engineering effort went into the design of the HandBook&#x27;s keyboard. It featured 17.8 mm center-to center key spacing and 2 mm travel for a firm feel.

After the success of the original Gateway HandBook, Gateway came out with a 486 model. The HandBook 486 (as it was called) was originally available as two models: A 486SX/25 and a 486DX/40 model. Gateway later on came out with HandBook 486 models utilizing a 486SX/33 or 486DX/50 processor. All of these handbooks used a grayscale 640x480 VGA display. Because of the small size of the unit, the display was distorted — what appear as circles on other displays come out as ovals on the HandBook 486.

The built-in hard disk for the HandBook 486 was usually 120 MB in size. The HandBook 486 was produced between 1993 and 1995. The HandBook 486 had 4 MB of built-in RAM, which can be expanded to 20 MB. As of 2005, it is still possible to buy memory for the HandBook 486, although one should test the memory with memtest since memory for older computers is more likely to be defective.

It was possible to install Linux or OpenBSD on these computers; the HandBook 486 is probably the earliest Linux-compatible subnotebook released. It was even possible to run the X Window System after the memory was expanded. The HandBook 486 has a PCMCIA II interface. While Modern Cardbus cards do not work with this interface, most older PCMCIA II cards (as long as they use no more than 250 mA of power) work fine. The HandBook 486 also has a pointing device similar to the IBM trackpoint located on the right hand side of the keyboard just above the enter key.

The Gateway HandBook remains one of the smallest laptops ever produced and was a precursor to Netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC, the Dell Inspiron Mini Series, and the Acer Aspire One. The Acer Aspire One is about the same size as the HandBook, and exists in a Gateway-branded form as the Gateway LT1004u.

<doc id="398413" wikidata="Q3530245" url="?curid=398413" title="Todd Blackadder">
<text>Todd Blackadder (born 20 September 1971) is a retired New Zealand rugby union player and professional rugby coach. He played 12 tests (25 games) for the All Blacks, and had 14 appearances as captain. Blackadder captained the Crusaders to three Super Rugby titles during his time with the franchise. He also won two National Provincial Championship titles with Canterbury. Blackadder coached the Crusaders for nine seasons from 2009 to 2016.

Blackadder began his career as a blindside flanker but switched to lock in 1998.

== Early years ==
Blackadder was born in Rangiora, New Zealand, where he grew up on his grandfather&#x27;s dairy farm, and took after his father and uncles by playing for the local rugby club. He attended Rangiora College, but did not make the 1st XV in his time there. When he left school, Blackadder moved north to Collingwood to take up a welding apprenticeship. While there, he played club rugby and impressed age-group selectors for Nelson Bays, which led to him eventually being selected for the New Zealand Under 19 tour of Australia. Blackadder left his welding apprenticeship to return to dairy farming, and found work on the farm of Brian McKay, the father of a friend in Collingwood. Blackadder and McKay&#x27;s daughter Priscilla married, and they returned to Rangiora where Blackadder had various jobs as a security guard and courier.

==Playing career==
Blackadder made his senior representative debut for Nelson Bays against Marlborough in 1990.

=== NPC ===
Blackadder made his debut for Canterbury in 1991. In 1997 Blackadder led Canterbury to its first NPC title in 14 years when they defeated Counties Manukau 44–13 in the final. Blackadder also won the Ranfurly Shield on several occasions including defeating Waikato in 1994 while he was also present when Canterbury ended Waikato&#x27;s three-year stranglehold on the shield in 2000. Blackadder played 126 games for Canterbury over his 11 years for the province. His final game for Canterbury was the 2001 NPC final against Otago which Canterbury won 30–19.

=== Super Rugby ===
Blackadder was part of the inaugural Crusaders team in 1996 and would go on to lead the side to its first Super Rugby title in 1998. They defeated the Blues in the final 20–13. Blackadder led the Crusaders to three consecutive Super Rugby championships in the 1999 and 2000 seasons, laying the foundations for the Crusaders&#x27; status as the most successful franchise in Super Rugby history.

=== International career ===
Blackadder played at the inaugural Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993. He was called in to the side as an injury replacement for Marc Ellis.

Blackadder was first selected for the All Blacks in 1995 and made his test debut against England at Dunedin on 20 June 1998. Blackadder was dropped from the All Blacks under John Hart, and missed the 1999 Rugby World Cup. New Zealand&#x27;s loss to France in the semi-finals resulted in Hart resigning from the coaching role. Following Hart&#x27;s departure, Wayne Smith was appointed head coach, and Blackadder was recalled to the team and named captain, succeeding Taine Randell. The decision was met with fanfare by some who liked Blackadders simple and uncomplicated approach. However, his locking ability and role leading the All Blacks were often under the microscope from the public and media, even as players like All Blacks great Jonah Lomu stated that he was one of the finest captains he ever played under. Following one season captaining the All Blacks, Blackadder failed to make the 30-man squad in the lead up to the Tri-Nations, and was replaced as captain by hooker Anton Oliver.

=== Scotland ===
Blackadder departed New Zealand for Scotland at the end of 2001, joining Scottish side Edinburgh Gunners.

==Coaching career==
Blackadder was named as assistant forwards coach of Scotland, under Matt Williams. He became the forwards coach of the Edinburgh Gunners under Frank Hadden. When Hadden left Edinburgh to replace Matt Williams in the national coaching role in 2005, Blackadder was named as Edinburgh&#x27;s head coach for the remainder of the season.

Blackadder confirmed his departure from Edinburgh to return to New Zealand in 2006.

=== Tasman ===
On his return to New Zealand, Blackadder took up a role as the Director of Rugby for the new Tasman Rugby Union, formed from an amalgamation of the Nelson Bays and Marlborough unions. While working with Tasman, Blackadder also worked in an advisory capacity with Robbie Deans and the Crusaders.

In 2007, Tasman coach Dennis Brown stepped down, and Blackadder stepped in as coach for the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup. In only their second year Tasman finished the 2008 season with four wins, one draw, and six losses.

=== Crusaders ===
Following the departure of coach Robbie Deans from the Crusaders, Blackadder was named as the sides new head coach ahead of the 2009 Super 14 Rugby Season. After a shaky start to the season with only one win from five games, the Blackadder coached Crusaders finished the season with eight wins, one draw, and four losses. They reached the semi-finals, losing to eventual champions the Bulls in Pretoria. 

In his second year in charge, the Crusaders were the only New Zealand team to advance to the playoffs, but again fell to the Bulls in the semi-finals. 

During the 2011 season, the Crusaders were dislodged from their home ground, Jade Stadium due to structural damage caused in Christchurch by the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. They played their home games at a number of venues throughout the Crusaders catchment area. Despite the disruption, the Crusaders managed to make the final that year, before falling to the Queensland Reds, who won their first title. 

In 2012, the Crusaders were knocked out by eventual first-time champions the Chiefs in the semi-finals.

In 2013, the Crusaders again fell to the Chiefs in the semi-final, and the Chiefs went on to their second consecutive championship. 

In the 2014 season, the Crusaders returned to the final but again fell short, this time against the New South Wales Waratahs after a controversial last minute penalty goal. 

In 2015, the Crusaders failed to make the knockout rounds for the first time in Blackadder&#x27;s tenure. Despite this, the Crusaders extended his contract for another year. In late 2015, it was announced that the 2016 Super Rugby Season would be Blackadder&#x27;s last as coach. 

In his final season as coach the Crusaders were knocked out in the quarter finals by the eventual runner-up Lions. 

During his time coaching the Crusaders, Blackadder guided the side to two Super Rugby Finals, and had a total record of 85 wins, 3 draws, and 45 losses from 133 games coached.

=== Bath ===
Blackadder was appointed Director of Rugby at Bath Rugby ahead of the 2016–17 Premiership Rugby season. He was joined at Bath by his assistant coach from the Crusaders, Tabai Matson, who took on the role of head coach. When Matson was forced to return home to New Zealand due to a family illness, Blackadder took over the coaching position. During his time as coach, the club was unable to reach finish better than the top six. On 17 April 2019, it was announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the 2018–19 season.

=== Toshiba ===
On his release from his final year of his contract with Bath, Blackadder revealed that he would be taking on the role of head coach with the Toshiba Brave Lupus in the Japanese Top League.

== Personal life ==
Todd&#x27;s son Ethan Blackadder currently plays for Tasman in the National Provincial Championship, and in 2018 made his debut for the Crusaders in Super Rugby.

On 3 July 2021, Ethan made his debut as an All Black against Tonga at Mount Smart Stadium. He came off the bench in the 102-0 victory, becoming All Black number 1195. Todd and Ethan Blackadder became the 21st father and son combination to have played for the All Blacks.

<text>Scope creep (also called requirement creep, or kitchen sink syndrome) in project management is continuous or uncontrolled growth in a project&#x27;s scope, generally experienced after the project begins. This can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled. It is generally considered harmful. It is related to but distinct from feature creep, because feature creep refers to features, and scope creep refers to the whole project.
== Common causes ==

=== Poorly defined project scope ===
Ineffective project management communication between a client and the project manager is a leading effect of project scope creep. An assignment that is not understood correctly will turn out to be completely different from clients vision. With that being said clients can also be to blame as they may not see a clear vision of what they want.

=== Failure to capture all requirements ===
Properly defining project scope requires thorough investigation by the project manager during the initial planning phase of a project. Failure to gather all information from all relevant stakeholders is a common reason for incomplete scope statements and missing requirements, which can frequently and easily lead to scope creep later in the project. It is essential that everyone on the team understands the project requirements thoroughly -- and that the project sponsor and relevant stakeholders have signed off on those requirements -- before execution of the project begins.

=== Lack of project management practices ===
Adoptions and adhering to project management practices and project management processes are confirmed methods of preventing scope creep from dismantling the project.

=== Addition of unnecessary features ===
Sometimes project teams tend to start adding additional features in order to impress the client. This may not work and tend to cause more work for such project and throw off the scope.

=== The communication gap between project stakeholders ===
Another huge cause of scope creep is the communication gap between the stakeholders. Clients may not respond quickly enough to the project managers causing the project to run into a bottleneck.

These aspects can affect the operational efficiencies of companies, especially when involved in long-term relationships. Scope creep is a risk in most projects. Most megaprojects fall victim to scope creep (see &quot;Megaprojects and Risk&quot;). Scope creep often results in cost overrun. A &quot;value for free&quot; strategy is difficult to counteract and remains a difficult challenge for even the most experienced project managers.

<doc id="398416" wikidata="Q1963130" url="?curid=398416" title="Map–territory relation">
<text>The map–territory relation is the relationship between an object and a representation of that object, as in the relation between a geographical territory and a map of it. Mistaking the map for the territory is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone confuses the semantics of a term with what it represents. Polish-American scientist and philosopher Alfred Korzybski remarked that &quot;the map is not the territory&quot; and that &quot;the word is not the thing&quot;, encapsulating his view that an abstraction derived from something, or a reaction to it, is not the thing itself. Korzybski held that many people do confuse maps with territories, that is, confuse conceptual models of reality with reality itself. These ideas are crucial to general semantics, a system Korzybski originated.

The relationship has also been expressed in other terms, such as &quot;the model is not the data&quot;, &quot;all models are wrong&quot;, and Alan Watts&#x27;s &quot;The menu is not the meal.&quot; The concept is thus quite relevant throughout ontology and applied ontology regardless of any connection to general semantics per se (or absence thereof). Its avatars are thus encountered in semantics, statistics, logistics, business administration, semiotics, and many other applications. 

A frequent coda to &quot;all models are wrong&quot; is that &quot;all models are wrong (but some are useful),&quot; which emphasizes the proper framing of recognizing map–territory differences—that is, how and why they are important, what to do about them, and how to live with them properly. The point is not that all maps are useless; rather, the point is simply to maintain critical thinking about the discrepancies: whether or not they are either negligible or significant in each context, how to reduce them (thus iterating a map, or any other model, to become a better version of itself), and so on. 

==History==
The phrase &quot;A map is not the territory&quot; was first introduced by Alfred Korzybski in his 1931 paper &quot;A Non-Aristotelian System and Its Necessity for Rigour in Mathematics and Physics,&quot; presented at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New Orleans, and later reprinted in &quot;Science and Sanity&quot; (1933). Korzybski credits mathematician Eric Temple Bell for the related phrase, &quot;the map is not the thing mapped.&quot; In the article, Korzybski states that &quot;A map the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.&quot;

The concept has been illustrated in various cultural works. Belgian surrealist René Magritte explored the idea in his painting &quot;The Treachery of Images&quot;, which depicts a pipe with the caption, &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une pipe&quot; (&quot;This is not a pipe&quot;). Lewis Carroll, in &quot;Sylvie and Bruno Concluded&quot; (1893), describes a fictional map with a scale of &quot;a mile to the mile,&quot; which proves impractical. Jorge Luis Borges similarly references a map as large as the territory in his short story &quot;On Exactitude in Science&quot; (1946). In his 1964 book &quot;Understanding Media&quot;, philosopher Marshall McLuhan argued that all media representations, including electronic media, are abstractions or &quot;extensions&quot; of reality.

The idea has influenced a number of modern works, including Robert M. Pirsig&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Michel Houellebecq&#x27;s novel &quot;The Map and the Territory&quot;, the latter of which won the Prix Goncourt. The concept is also discussed in the work of Robert Anton Wilson and James A. Lindsay, who critiques the confusion of conceptual maps with reality in his book &quot;Dot, Dot, Dot: Infinity Plus God Equals Folly&quot;. Historian of religion Jonathan Z. Smith named one of the books collecting his essays &quot;Map is Not Territory&quot;. Similarly, a collection of writings by AI Pessimist Eliezer Yudkowsky was named &quot;Map and Territory&quot;.

==Commentary==
Gregory Bateson, in his 1972 work &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot;, argued that understanding a territory is inherently limited by the sensory channels used to perceive it. He described the &quot;map&quot; of reality as an imperfect representation:

Bateson further explored this in &quot;The Cybernetics of &#x27;Self&#x27;: A Theory of Alcoholism&quot; (1971), arguing that a map&#x27;s usefulness lies in its structural analogy to the territory, rather than its literal truthfulness. For example, even a cultural belief in colds being caused by spirits can function effectively as a &quot;map&quot; for public health, analogous to germ theory. 

Philosopher David Schmidtz addresses the theme of accuracy in &quot;Elements of Justice&quot; (2006), highlighting how overly detailed models can become impractical, a problem also known as Bonini&#x27;s paradox. Poet Paul Valéry summarized this idea: &quot;Everything simple is false. Everything which is complex is unusable.&quot; 

The rise of electronic media and Jean Baudrillard&#x27;s concept of &quot;simulacra&quot; further complicates the map-territory distinction. In &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;, Baudrillard argues that in the modern age, simulations precede and even replace reality:

<text>John Carver was one of the Pilgrims who made the &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage in 1620 which resulted in the creation of Plymouth Colony in America. He is credited with writing the Mayflower Compact and was its first signer, and was also the first governor of Plymouth Colony.

==Life in Leiden==
Little is known about Carver&#x27;s ancestry or early family life. Jeremy Bangs notes that Carver and his wife Mary were members of the Walloon church in Leiden, Holland on February 8, 1609. The Flemish Walloon community was fleeing religious persecution in their homeland (then part of the Spanish Netherlands, now split between Belgium and France), as were the Puritan separatists who came to Holland from England around 1607.

Carver was a deacon in Leiden about 1609 at about age 25, and he is believed to have been born sometime before 1584. Leiden records of St. Pancras Church state that Carver buried a child on July 10, 1609. Sometime shortly after the death of the child, his wife Mary died. He later married Katherine White who was a prominent member of the Leiden English separatist church, though the exact date is not known. She was originally of Sturton in Nottinghamshire, eldest daughter of Alexander White. Carver became much more involved in the Leiden church after marrying Katherine, making a close association with Puritan pastor John Robinson, husband of Katherine&#x27;s younger sister Bridget.

==Preparing for the New World==
Carver and Robert Cushman began negotiations with officials of the Virginia Company in London in 1617 for land in the Colony of Virginia where they could live and be self-governing. They came in contact with Sir Edwin Sandys, an acquaintance of church elder William Brewster and a leading member of the Virginia Company. They had to put together seven articles for the Council for Virginia, signed by all the senior Puritan church members, which acknowledged the supremacy of the king and the Church of England.

To fund the &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage, the Leiden congregation turned to Thomas Weston and the Merchant Adventurers, London businessmen interested in supporting the voyage in hopes of profit. Carver had the task of organizing the voyage and negotiating funding with Weston and the Adventurers along with Cushman as the chief agent. In 1620, they were in Aldgate, London where they negotiated with Weston for financial backing. Weston hired the Mayflower, and it sailed from London to Southampton to rendezvous with the Speedwell, which was carrying the Pilgrims from Leiden in Holland. Carver was in Southampton in June 1620 purchasing supplies for the &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage, along with Christopher Martin. Carver was very wealthy and provided much of his personal fortune to invest in the joint-stock company and in the Mayflower voyage itself.

==&quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage==
Carver and his wife Katherine boarded &quot;Mayflower&quot; with five servants and seven year-old Jasper More, one of the four children of the More family who were sent in the care of the Pilgrims. Carver seems to have been elected governor of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; for the duration of the Atlantic crossing.

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; anchored off Cape Cod in November, 1620, and the Mayflower Compact was signed aboard ship on November 11; it became the first governing document for Plymouth Colony. Carver may have been the author of the Compact, and was definitely its first signer. He was subsequently chosen to be governor of Plymouth Colony.

==Life in Plymouth==

The first winter in Plymouth Colony was exceedingly difficult, as the colonists suffered greatly from lack of shelter, diseases such as scurvy, and general conditions on board ship. Nearly half the &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers died in the course of a few months. The first will drawn up in New England was that of William Mullins, and it was written on his behalf by Carver while Mullins was on his deathbed. It was signed as the last will and testament of Mullins by Carver, &quot;Mayflower&quot;&#x27;s captain Christopher Jones, and the ship&#x27;s surgeon Giles Heale. This is the only known copy of Carver&#x27;s signature.

On March 22, 1621, Governor Carver and Wampanoag leader Massasoit worked out a treaty of peace and mutual protection. This treaty lasted for more than half a century.

Carver died in April or May 1621, aged 56 years, and his wife died five or six weeks later.

== Family ==
John Carver married Mary de Lannoy sometime before February 8, 1609. She was a Walloon (Huguenot) of L’Escluse, France. She may have been related to Philip de Lannoy (Delano), who came to Plymouth on the &quot;Fortune&quot; in November 1621. The couple buried a child at St. Pancras in Leiden on July 10, 1609; Mary died soon after in July 1609.

He married Katherine (White) Leggatt sometime before May 22, 1615. She was the widow of George Leggatt. &quot;Mayflower&quot; genealogist Robert S. Wakefield spells her name as Catherine, but seventeenth century documents use Katherine. She died sometime in May 1621, some 5–6 weeks after Carver&#x27;s death. John and Katherine buried a child at St. Pancras in Leiden November 11, 1617. He had no known surviving descendants.

== Death ==
Carver had been working in his field on a hot day in April 1621 when he complained of a pain in his head. He returned to his house to lie down and soon fell into a coma, and he died within a few days, not long after April 5, 1621. William Bradford was chosen to replace him as governor; Bradford was recovering from illness, so Isaac Allerton was chosen to be his assistant. After all the secret burials that were performed all winter, the settlers wished to bury the governor with as much ceremony as possible. Bradford wrote in April 1621:
He was buried in the best manner they could, with some vollies of shot by all that bore armes; and his wife, being weak, died within five or six weeks after him.

<doc id="398431" wikidata="Q4782019" url="?curid=398431" title="April Fifth Action">
<text>April Fifth Action () is a Hong Kong left-wing group named after the first Tiananmen incident of 5 April 1976. While the organization&#x27;s Chinese name translates as &quot;April Fifth Action&quot;, English-language media in Hong Kong usually refer to it as the April Fifth Action Group (AFAG).

==Beliefs==
The April Fifth Action Group was formed on the basis of the Trotskyite vanguard party Revolutionary Marxist League which was disbanded in 1990. Legislative Council members &quot;Longhair&quot; Leung Kwok-hung and Leung Yiu-chung were the founding members of the April Fifth Action Group.

The group believes that without a democratic China, it would be impossible to have a democratic Hong Kong. The group is aligned with the pro-democracy camp in its opposition to the governments of China and the HKSAR.

The group calls for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, opposes unemployment and poverty, eliminates pro-government parties, terminates one-party dictatorship in China, sets up unemployment benefits and minimum wage and strives for the right to hold plebiscites in Hong Kong. It also calls for release of all dissidents in mainland China and accountability for the Tiananmen massacre of 1989.

==Protests==

The group is well known for its aggressive and civil disobedience-style actions to protest against the governments of China and Hong Kong during celebrations and visits of state leaders, often resulting in confrontations with the Hong Kong police. They usually carry a coffin as their trademark protest prop. Its members have also been prosecuted for disrupting meetings of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo).

The group was one of the major supporters of the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989 in Hong Kong. Its members went to the New China News Agency Hong Kong branch demanding the PRC government open dialogue with students on democratic reform and rule of law in late April. It condemned the bloody suppression of the protest. The members were prosecuted with the Summer Offences Ordinance after their demonstrations outside a reception hosted by the New China News Agency on 29 September 1989 to mark the National Day of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. That raised concern that the British administration might be using out-of-date and repressive colonial laws for the political appeasing the People&#x27;s Republic of China government after Beijing accusations that the British Hong Kong administration was allowing Hong Kong to be used as a base for subversion of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In a protest on 1 June 1997 just a month before the handover of Hong Kong which drew a crowd of 5,000 people in Hong Kong going from Chater Garden to the New China News Agency. The group was blocked off by the Hong Kong police, and did not succeed in presenting a petition to the news office. While the event led Hong Kong news headlines, China&#x27;s main CCTV station promoted the opposite propaganda on the mainland by featuring children in Wan Chai waiving PRC flags. Critics have questioned the effectiveness of the group, since Beijing has continued to censor news of the group&#x27;s activities entirely in the mainland.

==Elections==
The group&#x27;s most famous member, Leung Kwok-hung, unsuccessfully contested both the 2000 LegCo election and 2003 District Council elections. He considered the latter battle a victory because of the number of votes he got in the Kam Ping constituency which traditionally supports pro-Beijing candidates. He finally succeeded in the 2004 LegCo election and became the first member of the April Fifth Action in the Legislative Council. His election was widely viewed as a protest vote against the unpopular administration of then Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.

Leung attracted controversy by refusing to take the standard oath required for all legislators, instead reciting his own expanded version. Leung Kwok-hung gained most of his voter popularity owing to his relatively radical stance on various issues, criticising the indecision and inefficiency that paralysed the Hong Kong government due to weak leadership under Tung Chee-hwa. Leung was re-elected with an increased majority in 2008 under the League of Social Democrats banner, becoming the candidate with the most votes in his constituency.

<text>Alice Cary (April 26, 1820February 12, 1871) was an American poet, and the older sister of fellow poet Phoebe Cary (1824–1871).

==Biography==

Alice Cary was born on April 26, 1820, in Mount Healthy, Ohio, off the Miami River near Cincinnati. Her parents lived on a farm bought by Robert Cary in 1813 in what is now North College Hill, Ohio. He called the Clovernook Farm. The farm was north of Cincinnati, a good distance from schools, and the father could not afford to give their large family of nine children a very good education. But Alice and her sister Phoebe were fond of reading and studied all they could.

While the sisters were raised in a Universalist household and held political and religious views that were liberal and reformist, they often attended Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist services and were friendly with ministers of all these denominations and others. According to Phoebe,

When Alice was 17 and Phoebe 13, they began to write verses, which were printed in newspapers. Their mother had died in 1835, and two years afterward their father married again. Their stepmother was wholly unsympathetic regarding the literary aspirations of Alice and Phoebe. For their part, while the sisters were ready and while willing to aid to the full extent of their strength in household labor, they persisted in a determination to study and write when the day&#x27;s work was done. Sometimes they were refused the use of candles to the extent of their wishes, and the device of a saucer of lard with a bit of rag for a wick was their only light after the rest of the family had retired.

Alice&#x27;s first major poem, &quot;The Child of Sorrow&quot;, was published in 1838 and was praised by influential critics including Edgar Allan Poe, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, and Horace Greeley. Alice and her sister were included in the influential anthology &quot;The Female Poets of America&quot; prepared by Rufus Griswold. Griswold encouraged publishers to put forth a collection of the sisters&#x27; poetry, even asking John Greenleaf Whittier to provide a preface. Whittier refused, believing their poetry did not need his endorsement, and also noting a general dislike for prefaces as a method to &quot;pass off by aid of a known name, what otherwise would not pass current&quot;. In 1849, a Philadelphia publisher accepted the book, &quot;Poems of Alice and Phoebe Cary&quot;, and Griswold wrote the preface, left unsigned. By the spring of 1850, Alice and Griswold were often corresponding through letters which were often flirtatious. This correspondence ended by the summer of that year.

The anthology made Alice and Phoebe well known, and in 1850 they moved to New York City, where they devoted themselves to writing and garnered much fame. There, they also hosted receptions on Sunday evenings that drew notable figures including P. T. Barnum, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, John Greenleaf Whittier, Horace Greeley, Bayard Taylor and his wife, Richard and Elizabeth Stoddard, Robert Dale Owen, Oliver Johnson, Mary Mapes Dodge, Mrs. Croly, Mrs. Victor, Edwin H. Chapin, Henry M. Field, Charles F. Deems, Samuel Bowles, Thomas B. Aldrich, Anna E. Dickinson, George Ripley, Madame Le Vert, Henry Wilson, Justin McCarthy; in short, all the noted contemporary names in the different departments of literature and art might fairly be added to the list.

Alice wrote for the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;New York Ledger&quot;, the &quot;Independent&quot;, and other literary periodicals. Her articles, whether prose or poetry, were gathered subsequently into volumes which were received well in the United States and abroad. She also wrote novels and poems which did not make their first appearance in periodicals. Among her prose works were &quot;The Clovernook Children&quot; and &quot;Snow Berries, a Book for Young Folks&quot;.

In 1868, Horace Greeley wrote a brief joint biography of Alice and Phebe (as he spelled her name).
Alice died of tuberculosis in 1871 in New York at age 50. The pallbearers at her funeral included P. T. Barnum and Horace Greeley. Alice Cary is buried alongside her sister Phoebe in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

The Cary Home stands today on the east side of Hamilton Avenue (US 127), on the campus of the Clovernook Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired in North College Hill.

==Remembrance==
The first volume of &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;, published in 1881, states, “THESE VOLUMES ARE AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED TO THE Memory of Mary Wollstonecraft, Frances Wright, Lucretia Mott, Harriet Martineau, Lydia Maria Child, Margaret Fuller, Sarah and Angelina Grimké, Josephine S. Griffing, Martha C. Wright, Harriot K. Hunt, M.D., Mariana W. Johnson, Alice and Phebe Carey, Ann Preston, M.D., Lydia Mott, Eliza W. Farnham, Lydia F. Fowler, M.D., Paulina Wright Davis, Whose Earnest Lives and Fearless Words, in Demanding Political Rights for Women, have been, in the Preparation of these Pages, a Constant Inspiration TO The Editors”.

<doc id="398437" wikidata="Q7863301" url="?curid=398437" title="U.S. presidential IQ hoax">
<text>The U.S. presidential IQ hoax was a mid-2001 e-mail and internet hoax that purported to provide a list of estimated IQs of the U.S. presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush.

== The hoax ==
The hoax email showed Bill Clinton having the IQ 182, and George W. Bush 91. However, the numbers claimed in the email were fabricated, and the sociologists and institutions (e.g., the &quot;Lovenstein Institute&quot;) quoted in the article do not exist. The techniques purportedly used to measure the IQ of the presidents are not recognized means of measuring IQs. The hoax also contains other factual errors. When the hoax was debunked, it appeared that Bush&#x27;s IQ and college entrance test scores were never released.

== Coverage ==
Perhaps because some pundits and politicians claimed George W. Bush had low intelligence, the hoax was widely unquestioned. The British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, for example, quoted the report in its diary section of July 19, 2001, and used it to belittle Bush, although the paper published a retraction two days after the Associated Press drew attention to the error. Other media outlets to fall for the hoax included &quot;Bild&quot; (Germany), &quot;Pravda&quot; (Russia), and the &quot;Southland Times&quot; (New Zealand) as well as a few U.S. newspapers. 

The IQ hoax was revived in March 2007 in Spanish-language media when the news agency EFE distributed a piece referring to it. Dozens of outlets (primarily in their online versions) reproduced EFE&#x27;s text. Among the newspapers publishing the hoax were &quot;El País&quot; (Spain&#x27;s leading newspaper), ABC, &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;, and &quot;El Mercurio&quot; (Chile&#x27;s leading newspaper).

== IQ estimations by academics ==
In 2001, political psychologist Aubrey Immelman made an IQ estimation of G. W. Bush based on the SAT Reasoning Test results of Bush (1206) and Al Gore, who achieved IQ scores of 133 and 134 in his school years, and an SAT of 1355: &quot;It&#x27;s tempting to employ Al Gore&#x27;s IQ:SAT ratio of 134:1355 as a formula for estimating Bush&#x27;s probable intelligence quotient—an exercise in fuzzy statistics that predicts a score of 119.&quot;

A 2006 study analyzing presidential IQs by Dean Keith Simonton of U.C. Davis appeared in the journal &quot;Political Psychology&quot;. Simonton&#x27;s study analyzed the results of varied and often subjective historical material using the tools of historiometry. It estimated IQs for all US presidents, and validated the headline of the hoax, which stated Bush&#x27;s was the lowest of any president in the last 50 years, though it estimates his IQ considerably higher (by nearly two standard deviations) than the 91 suggested in the hoax report. It rated G.W. Bush second to last since 1900, with an estimated IQ of 119 (the estimates ranged from 111 to 139). Bush&#x27;s estimated IQ was less than those estimated for Grant (120), Monroe (124), and Harding (124). The same study estimated president Bill Clinton&#x27;s IQ at 149, behind only those of Kennedy (151), Jefferson (154) and John Quincy Adams (169).

Simonton&#x27;s 2006 study follows earlier studies done on this subject, including a 1926 study by Catharine Cox Miles. This study concluded that there is a statistically significant correlation of 0.56 between a U.S. president&#x27;s IQ and his perceived amount of success. It is worth noting that other sources and/or studies might have different results for the IQs of United States presidents. For instance, John F. Kennedy&#x27;s IQ has also been estimated to have been significantly lower than in this 2006 study (Chester Arthur biographer Thomas C. Reeves refers to an actual IQ test by Kennedy with a score of 119), while Richard Nixon&#x27;s IQ has also been estimated to have been significantly higher than in this study.

<doc id="398439" wikidata="Q7099014" url="?curid=398439" title="Option time value">
<text>In finance, the time value (TV) (&quot;extrinsic&quot; or &quot;instrumental&quot; value) of an option is the premium a rational investor would pay over its &quot;current&quot; exercise value (intrinsic value), based on the probability it will increase in value before expiry. For an American option this value is always greater than zero in a fair market, thus an option is &quot;always&quot; worth more than its current exercise value. As an option can be thought of as &#x27;price insurance&#x27; (e.g., an airline insuring against unexpected soaring fuel costs caused by a hurricane), TV can be thought of as the &quot;risk premium&quot; the option seller charges the buyer—the higher the expected risk (volatility formula_1 time), the higher the premium. Conversely, TV can be thought of as the price an investor is willing to pay for potential upside.

Time value decays to zero at expiration, with a general rule that it will lose of its value during the first half of its life and in the second half. As an option moves closer to expiry, moving its price requires an increasingly larger move in the price of the underlying security.

==Intrinsic value==

The intrinsic value (IV) of an option is the value of exercising it now. If the price of the underlying stock is above a call option strike price, the option has a positive intrinsic value, and is referred to as being in-the-money. If the underlying stock is priced cheaper than the call option&#x27;s strike price, its intrinsic value is zero and the call option is referred to as being out-of-the-money. An out-of-the-money option can nevertheless have an overall positive monetary value prior to expiry due to its time value. If an option is out-of-the-money at expiration, its holder simply abandons the option and it expires worthless. Hence, &quot;a purchased option can never have a negative value&quot;. This is because a rational investor would choose to buy the underlying stock at the market price rather than exercise an out-of-the-money call option to buy the same stock at a higher-than-market price.

For the same reasons, a put option is in-the-money if it allows the purchase of the underlying at a market price below the strike price of the put option. A put option is out-of-the-money if the underlying&#x27;s spot price is higher than the strike price.

As shown in the below equations and graph, the intrinsic value (IV) of a call option is positive when the underlying asset&#x27;s spot price &quot;S&quot; exceeds the option&#x27;s strike price &quot;K&quot;.

:Value of a call option: formula_2, or formula_3
:Value of a put option: formula_4, or formula_5

==Option value==

Option value (i.e.. price) is estimated via a predictive formula such as Black-Scholes or using a numerical method such as the Binomial model. This price incorporates the expected probability of the option finishing &quot;in-the-money&quot;. For an out-of-the-money option, the further in the future the expiration date—i.e. the longer the time to exercise—the higher the chance of this occurring, and thus the higher the option price; for an in-the-money option the chance of being in the money &quot;decreases&quot;; however the fact that the option cannot have negative value also works in the owner&#x27;s favor. The sensitivity of the option value to the amount of time to expiry is known as the option&#x27;s theta. The option value will never be lower than its IV.

As seen on the graph, the full call option value (IV + TV), at a given time t, is the red line.



==Time value==
Time value is, as above, the difference between option value and intrinsic value, i.e.

:codice_1

More specifically, TV reflects the probability that the option will gain in IV — become (more) profitable to exercise before it expires. An important factor is the underlying instrument&#x27;s volatility. Volatility in underlying prices increase the likelihood and magnitude of a gain in IV, thus enhancing the option&#x27;s value and stimulating option demand. Numerically, this value depends on the time until the expiration date and the volatility of the underlying instrument&#x27;s price. TV of American option cannot be negative (because the option value is never lower than IV), and converges to zero at expiration. Prior to expiration, the change in TV with time is non-linear, being a function of the option price.

<doc id="398443" wikidata="Q1591663" url="?curid=398443" title="Eyebrowed thrush">
<text>The eyebrowed thrush (Turdus obscurus) is a member of the thrush family Turdidae. It breeds in dense coniferous forest and taiga eastwards from Siberia and Mongolia to Japan. It is strongly migratory, wintering south to China and Southeast Asia. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe.

==Taxonomy==
The eyebrowed thrush was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus obscurus&quot;. The scientific name comes from Latin &quot;Turdus&quot; meaning &quot;thrush&quot; and &quot;obscurus&quot; meaning &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;dusky&quot;. Gmelin based his account on the &quot;Dark thrush&quot; that had been described in 1783 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume work &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham noted that &quot;This is Sibirian species and found in the woods beyond Lake Baikal&quot; but did not explain the source of his information. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
This is an attractive thrush, with a grey back and head, the latter having a black eyeline, bordered white above and below. The breast and flanks are orange, and the belly white. The sexes are fairly similar, but immatures have a browner back.

The male has a simple whistling song, similar to the related mistle thrush.

==Behaviour==
It nests in trees, laying 4-6 eggs in a neat nest. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form small flocks. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms and berries.
In 2007 an eyebrowed thrush was sighted at the Jerusalem Bird Observatory in Jerusalem. This is the second recorded sighting in Israel; the first was at Eilat in October 1996.

In 2011, an eyebrowed thrush was sighted in Australia, near Malanda in Queensland. This is possibly the first confirmed sighting of the species on the Australian mainland.

==Fossil record==
In 2017, an assessment of late Pleistocene Indonesian passerines found a fossil of this species.

<text>The Mellon College of Science (MCS) is part of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US. The college is named for the Mellon family, founders of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, a predecessor of Carnegie Mellon University.

The college offers various bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. It also awards the Dickson Prize in Science. Since January 2025, the Glen de Vries Dean of the Mellon College of Science is Barbara Shinn-Cunningham, an American bioengineer and neuroscientist. She succeeds Interim Dean Curtis A. Meyer, and the previous Dean Rebecca Doerge, who served in the role from 2016-2023.

==History==
The Mellon College of Science was founded in 1967, when the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to form Carnegie Mellon University. The scientific faculty and staff of both institutions became part of the new college, then named the Mellon College of Engineering and Science. As the college grew and scientific research advanced, the Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering was split off in 1970, and the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science split off in 1988.

==Facilities==
 The administration of MCS, as well as most of its biological sciences and chemistry faculty and research labs, and the college&#x27;s library, are based in the Mellon Institute, which was constructed in 1937. The neoclassical building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and was designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark in 2013 by the American Chemical Society. The college&#x27;s physics and mathematical sciences departments are based in Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s main campus in Wean Hall, a Brutalist building constructed in 1971.

==Organization==
The Mellon College of Science houses four academic departments: Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Physics, and Mathematical Sciences, each of which grants a variety of undergraduate and graduate degrees. In addition, the college also oversees or is affiliated with a number of interdisciplinary research centers, including the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.

<text>Erotic literature comprises fictional and factual stories and accounts of eros (passionate, romantic or sexual relationships) intended to arouse similar feelings in readers. This contrasts erotica, which focuses more specifically on sexual feelings. Other common elements are satire and social criticism. Much erotic literature features erotic art, illustrating the text. 

Although cultural disapproval of erotic literature has always existed, its circulation was not seen as a major problem before the invention of printing, as the costs of producing individual manuscripts limited distribution to a very small group of wealthy and literate readers. The invention of printing, in the 15th century, brought with it both a greater market and increasing restrictions, including censorship and legal restraints on publication on the grounds of obscenity. Because of this, much of the production of this type of material became .

==History==
===Early periods===
The oldest located love poem is Istanbul 2461, an erotic monologue written by a female speaker directed to king Shu-Sin.

In ancient Sumer, a whole cycle of poems revolved around the erotic lovemaking between the goddess Inanna and her consort Dumuzid the Shepherd.

In the Hebrew Bible, the Song of Songs, found in the last section of the Tanakh, celebrates sexual love, giving &quot;the voices of two lovers, praising each other, yearning for each other, proffering invitations to enjoy&quot;.

Many erotic poems have survived from ancient Greece and Rome. The Greek poets Straton of Sardis and Sappho of Lesbos both wrote erotic lyric poems. The poet Archilochus wrote numerous satirical poems filled with obscene and erotic imagery. Erotic poems continued to be written in Hellenistic and Roman times by writers like Automedon (&quot;The Professional&quot; and &quot;Demetrius the Fortunate&quot;), Philodemus (&quot;Charito&quot;) and Marcus Argentarius. Notable Roman erotic poets included Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, Martial and Juvenal, and the anonymous Priapeia. Some later Latin authors such as Joannes Secundus also wrote erotic verse.

&quot;Haft Peykar&quot; () also known as &quot;Bahramnameh&quot; (, &quot;The Book of Bahram&quot;) is a romantic epic by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi written in 1197. This poem is a part of the &quot;Nizami&#x27;s Khamsa&quot;. The original title &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; can be translated literally as &quot;seven portraits&quot; with the figurative meaning of &quot;seven beauties.&quot; The poem is a masterpiece of erotic literature, but it is also a profoundly moralistic work.

During the Renaissance period, many poems were not written for publication; instead, they were merely circulated in manuscript form among a relatively limited readership. This was the original method of circulation for the &quot;Sonnets&quot; of William Shakespeare, who also wrote the erotic poems &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;.

&quot;The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight&quot; (Arabic: الروض العاطر في نزهة الخاطر) is a fifteenth-century Arabic sex manual and work of erotic literature by Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Nefzawi, also known simply as &quot;Nefzawi&quot;. The book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive and gives advice on sexual technique, warnings about sexual health, and recipes to remedy sexual maladies. It gives lists of names for the penis and vulva, and has a section on the interpretation of dreams. Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement.

===17th century===
In the 17th century, John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1647–80) was notorious for obscene verses, many of which were published posthumously in compendiums of poetry by him and other &quot;Restoration rakes&quot; such as Sir Charles Sedley, Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, and George Etherege. Though many of the poems attributed to Rochester were actually by other authors, his reputation as a libertine was such that his name was used as a selling point by publishers of collections of erotic verse for centuries after. One poem definitely by him was &quot;A Ramble in St. James&#x27;s Park&quot;, in which the protagonist&#x27;s quest for healthy exercise in the park uncovers instead &quot;Bugg&#x27;ries, Rapes and Incest&quot; on ground polluted by debauchery from the time when &quot;Ancient Pict began to Whore&quot;. This poem was being censored from collections of Rochester&#x27;s poetry as late as 1953, though, in line with the subsequent general change in attitudes to sexuality, it was dramatised as a scene in the film &quot;The Libertine&quot; about his life, based on an existing play. 

English collections of erotic verse by various hands include the &quot;Drollery&quot; collections of the 17th century; &quot;Pills to Purge Melancholy&quot; (1698–1720); the &quot;Roxburghe Ballads&quot;; &quot;Bishop Percy&#x27;s Folio&quot;; &quot;The Musical Miscellany&quot;; &quot;National Ballad and Song: Merry Songs and Ballads Prior to the Year AD 1800&quot; (1895–97) edited by J. S. Farmer; the three volume &quot;Poetica Erotica&quot; (1921) and its more obscene supplement the &quot;Immortalia&quot; (1927) both edited by T. R. Smith. French collections include &quot;Les Muses gaillardes&quot; (1606) &quot;Le Cabinet satyrique&quot; (1618) and &quot;La Parnasse des poetes satyriques&quot; (1622).

=== 18th century ===
In the 18th century, a famous collection of four erotic poems, was published in England in 1763, called &quot;An Essay on Woman&quot;. This included the title piece, an obscene parody of Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Man&quot;; &quot;Veni Creator: or, The Maid&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, which is original; the &quot;Universal Prayer&quot;, an obscene parody of Pope&#x27;s poem of the same name, and &quot;The Dying Lover to his Prick&quot;, which parodies &quot;A Dying Christian to his Soul&quot; by Pope. These poems have been attributed to John Wilkes and/or Thomas Potter and receive the distinction of being the only works of erotic literature ever read out loud and in their entirety in the House of Lords—before being declared obscene and blasphemous by that body and the supposed author, Wilkes, declared an outlaw.

Robert Burns worked to collect and preserve Scottish folk songs, sometimes revising, expanding, and adapting them. One of the better known of these collections is &quot;The Merry Muses of Caledonia&quot; (the title is not by Burns), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century.

===19th century===
One of the 19th century&#x27;s foremost poets—Algernon Charles Swinburne—devoted much of his considerable talent to erotic verse, producing, inter alia, twelve eclogues on flagellation titled &quot;The Flogging Block&quot; &quot;by Rufus Rodworthy, annotated by Barebum Birchingly&quot;; more was published anonymously in &quot;The Whippingham Papers&quot; (). Another notorious anonymous 19th-century poem on the same subject is &quot;The Rodiad&quot;, ascribed (seemingly falsely and in jest) to George Colman the Younger. John Camden Hotten even wrote a pornographic comic opera, &quot;Lady Bumtickler&#x27;s Revels&quot;, on the theme of flagellation in 1872.

Pierre Louÿs helped found a literary review, &quot;La Conque&quot; in 1891, where he proceeded to publish &quot;Astarte&quot;—an early collection of erotic verse already marked by his distinctive elegance and refinement of style. He followed up in 1894 with another erotic collection in 143 prose poems—&quot;Songs of Bilitis (Les Chansons de Bilitis)&quot;, this time with strong lesbian themes.

===20th century===
Although D. H. Lawrence could be regarded as a writer of love poems, he usually dealt in the less romantic aspects of love such as sexual frustration or the sex act itself. Ezra Pound, in his &quot;Literary Essays&quot;, complained of Lawrence&#x27;s interest in his own &quot;disagreeable sensations&quot; but praised him for his &quot;low-life narrative&quot;. This is a reference to Lawrence&#x27;s dialect poems akin to the Scots poems of Robert Burns, in which he reproduced the language and concerns of the people of Nottinghamshire from his youth. He called one collection of poems &quot;Pansies&quot; partly for the simple ephemeral nature of the verse but also a pun on the French word &quot;panser&quot;, to dress or bandage a wound. &quot;The Noble Englishman&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look at Me&quot; were removed from the official edition of &quot;Pansies&quot; on the grounds of obscenity; Lawrence felt wounded by this.

From the age of 17, Gavin Ewart acquired a reputation for wit and accomplishment through such works as &quot;Phallus in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Poems and Songs&quot;, which appeared in 1939 and was his first collection. The intelligence and casually flamboyant virtuosity with which he framed his often humorous commentaries on human behaviour made his work invariably entertaining and interesting. The irreverent eroticism for which his poetry is noted resulted in W H Smith&#x27;s banning of his &quot;The Pleasures of the Flesh&quot; (1966) from their shops.

Canadian poet John Glassco wrote &quot;Squire Hardman&quot; (1967), a long poem in heroic couplets, purporting to be a reprint of an 18th-century poem by George Colman the Younger, on the theme of flagellation.

Italian Una Chi distinguished herself among other publications for coldly analytical prose and for the crudeness of the stories.

==Other accounts==

===Writings of prostitutes===
Prostitution was the focus of much of the earliest erotic works. The term &quot;pornography&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;pornographos&quot; meaning &quot;writer about prostitutes&quot;, originally denoting descriptions of the lives and manners of prostitutes and their customers in Ancient Greece. According to Athenaeus in &quot;The Deipnosophists&quot; these constituted a considerable genre, with many lubricious treatises, stories and dramas on the subject. A surviving example of this genre is Lucian of Samosata&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Courtesans&quot;.

Accounts of prostitution have continued as a major part of the genre of erotic literature. In the 18th century, directories of prostitutes and their services, such as &quot;Harris&#x27;s List of Covent Garden Ladies&quot; (1757–1795), provided both entertainment and instruction.

In the 19th century, the sensational journalism of W. T. Stead&#x27;s &quot;The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&quot; (1885) about the procuring of underage girls into the brothels of Victorian London provided a stimulus for the erotic imagination. Stead&#x27;s account was widely translated and the revelation of &quot;padded rooms for the purpose of stifling the cries of the tortured victims of lust and brutality&quot; and the symbolic figure of &quot;The Minotaur of London&quot; confirmed European observers worst imaginings about &quot;Le Sadisme anglais&quot; and inspired erotic writers to write of similar scenes set in London or involving sadistic English gentlemen. Such writers include D&#x27;Annunzio in &quot;Il Piacere&quot;, Paul-Jean Toulet in &quot;Monsieur de Paur&quot; (1898), Octave Mirbeau in &quot;Jardin des Supplices&quot; (1899) and Jean Lorrain in &quot;Monsieur de Phocas&quot; (1901).

Well-known recent works in this genre are &quot;The Happy Hooker: My Own Story&quot; (1971) by the Dutch madame Xaviera Hollander and &quot;The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl&quot; (2005) by Belle de Jour.

===Writings of students===

In the 21st century, a new literary genre of student published journals at American universities was started. The following is a partial list of publications:
* &quot;The Moderator&quot; – Bard College
* &quot;Virgin Mawrtyr&quot; – Bryn Mawr College
* &quot;H-Bomb&quot; – Harvard University
* &quot;Quake&quot; – University of Pennsylvania
* &quot;Squirm&quot; – Vassar College
* &quot;Vita Excolatur&quot; – University of Chicago
* &quot;Bang&quot; and Untouchables – Swarthmore College
* &quot;Boink&quot; – Boston University

===Sex manuals===
Sex manuals are among the oldest forms of erotic literature. Three brief fragments of a sex manual written in the fourth century BC that is attributed to Philaenis of Samos have survived. Modern scholars generally regard it as a work of parody probably written by a man, and this was most likely Athenian sophist Polycrates. Other examples of the genre from the classical world include the lost works of Elephantis and Ovid&#x27;s . The Indian &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s best-known works of this type. The &quot;Ananga Ranga&quot;, a 12th-century collection of Indian erotic works, is a lesser known one. &quot;The Perfumed Garden for the Soul&#x27;s Recreation&quot;, a 16th-century Arabic work by Sheikh Nefzaoui, is also well-known and is often reprinted and translated. There is anecdotal evidence that, as late as the mid-20th century, sex therapists and other physicians prescribed erotic literature as treatment for erectile dysfunction.

The ancient Chinese versions of the sex manual include the texts that contain the Taoist sexual practices. These include books that show illustrations of the ideal sexual behavior because sex in this religion is not considered taboo but a manifestation of the concept of the yin and yang, wherein the male and female engage in an act of &quot;joining of energy&quot; or &quot;joining of essences&quot;. The belief is that proper sexual practice is key to achieving good health. The manuals included the Ishinpo text, which is a medical document that also included sections devoted to sexual hygiene and sexual manuals of the Tang and Han dynasties.

Qigong manuals include warming a wet towel and covering penis for a few minutes, then rubbing one direction away from base of penis hundreds of times daily, similar to qigong. Squeezing sphincter while semi-erect or fully erect dozens of times daily, particularly a few hours before intercourse will help delay orgasm or enhance non-ejaculatory pleasure. The Universal Tao system was developed by Mantak Chia to teach Taoist meditative and exercise techniques to balance the body and increase and refine one&#x27;s vital energy, or &quot;qi&quot;. Front and back channel, the back channel is where the perineum is located between anus and scrotum moving up the tailbone to the crown, the front channel is moving down the front of your body down the midline. Breathing up the back channel and then breathing out from the front channel down to and from the abdomen moves chi. Many practices combined help chi to be transformed into spiritual energy or &quot;shen&quot;.

Not all sex manuals were produced to arouse or inform readers about sexual acts. Some were created as a form of satire or social criticism, as in the case of a mock-sex manual produced in the early sixteenth century by Pietro Aretino. It was in response to the clerical censorship of the nude engravings of the Roman artists Marcantonio Raimondi. This was released in cheap wood, with a corresponding sonnet serving as the voice of the characters.

=== Erotic memoirs ===
Erotic memoirs are a subgenre of erotic literature that blend personal experiences with sensual storytelling.

===Erotic fiction===
Erotic fiction is a genre of fiction that portrays sex or sexual themes, generally in a more literary way than the fiction seen in pornographic magazines. It sometimes includes elements of satire or social criticism. These type of fiction have frequently been banned by the government or religious authorities.

==Legal status==

===Early legislation===

====To 1857====
Erotic or pornographic works have often been prosecuted, censored and destroyed by the authorities on grounds of obscenity. In medieval England, erotic or pornographic publications were the concern of the ecclesiastical courts. After the Reformation the jurisdiction of these courts declined in favour of the Crown, which licensed every printed book. Prosecutions of books for their erotic content alone were rare and works which attacked the church or state gave much more concern to the authorities than erotica or &#x27;obscene libel&#x27; as it was then known. For instance the Licensing Act 1662 was aimed generally at &quot;heretical, seditious, schismatical or offensive books of pamphlets&quot; rather than just erotica per se. Even this Licensing Act was allowed to lapse in 1695 and no attempt made to renew it.

The first conviction for obscenity in England occurred in 1727, when Edmund Curll was fined for the publication of &quot;Venus in the Cloister or The Nun in her Smock&quot; under the common law offence of disturbing the King&#x27;s peace. This set a legal precedent for other convictions. The publication of other books by Curll, however, considered seditious and blasphemous, such as &quot;The Memoirs of John Ker&quot;, apparently most offended the authorities. Prosecutions of erotica later in the 18th century were rare and were most often taken because of the admixture of seditious and blasphemous material with the porn.

====1857–1959====
 It was the Obscene Publications Act 1857 which made the sale of obscene material a statutory offense, giving the courts power to seize and destroy offending material. The origins of the act itself were in a trial for the sale of pornography presided over by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Campbell, at the same time as a debate in the House of Lords over a bill aiming to restrict the sale of poisons. Campbell was taken by the analogy between the two situations, famously referring to the London pornography trade as &quot;a sale of poison more deadly than prussic acid, strychnine or arsenic&quot;, and proposed a bill to restrict the sale of pornography; giving statutory powers of destruction would allow for a much more effective degree of prosecution. The bill was controversial at the time, receiving strong opposition from both Houses of Parliament. It was passed on the assurance by the Lord Chief Justice that it was &quot;intended to apply exclusively to works written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth and of a nature calculated to shock the common feelings of decency in any well-regulated mind.&quot; The House of Commons successfully amended it so as not to apply to Scotland, on the grounds that Scottish common law was sufficiently stringent.

The Act provided for the seizure and destruction of any material deemed to be obscene, and held for sale or distribution, following information being laid before a &quot;court of summary jurisdiction&quot; (magistrates&#x27; court). The Act required that following evidence of a common-law offence being committed – for example, on the report of a plain-clothes policeman who had successfully purchased the material – the court could issue a warrant for the premises to be searched and the material seized. The proprietor then would be called upon to attend court and give reason why the material should not be destroyed. Critically, the Act did not define &quot;obscene&quot;, leaving this to the will of the courts.

While the Act itself did not change, the scope of the work affected by it did. In 1868 Sir Alexander Cockburn, Campbell&#x27;s successor as Lord Chief Justice, held in an appeal that the test of obscenity was &quot;whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.&quot; This was clearly a major change from Campbell&#x27;s opinion only ten years before – the test now being the effect on someone open to corruption who obtained a copy, not whether the material was &quot;intended&quot; to corrupt or offend.

Cockburn&#x27;s declaration remained in force for several decades, and most of the high profile seizures under the Act relied on this interpretation. Known as the Hicklin test no cognisance was taken of the literary merit of a book or on the extent of the offending text within the book in question. The widened scope of the original legislation led to the subsequent notorious targeting of now acknowledged classics of world literature by such authors as Zola, James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence plus medical textbooks by such as Havelock Ellis rather than the blatant erotica which was the original target of this law.

In contrast to England, where actions against obscene literature were the preserve of the magistrates, such actions were the responsibility of the Postal Inspection Service in America. They were embodied in the federal and state Comstock laws and named after the postal officer and anti-obscenity crusader Anthony Comstock, who proved himself officious in the work of suppression both in his official capacity and through his New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. The first such law was the Comstock Act, (ch. 258 enacted March 3, 1873) which made it illegal to send any &quot;obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious&quot; materials through the mail. Twenty-four states passed similar prohibitions on materials distributed within the states.

===Modern legislation===

This question of whether a book had literary merit eventually prompted a change in the law in both America and the UK. In the United Kingdom the Obscene Publications Act 1959 provided for the protection of &quot;literature&quot; but conversely increased the penalties against pure &quot;pornography.&quot; The law defined obscenity and separated it from serious works of art.

The new definition read:

[A]n article shall be deemed to be obscene if its effect or (where the article comprises two or more distinct items) the effect of any one of its items is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.

After this piece of legislation questions of the literary merit of the work in question were allowed to be put before the judge and jury as in the &quot;Lady Chatterley&quot; trial. The publishers of the latter book were found not guilty by the court on the grounds of the literary merit of the book. In later prosecutions of literary erotica under the provisions of the act, however, even purely pornographic works with no apparent literary merit escaped destruction by the authorities. Purely textual pornographic texts, with no hint of libel, ceased to be brought to trial following the collapse of the &quot;Inside Linda Lovelace&quot; trial in 1976. However, in October 2008, a man was unsuccessfully prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act (the &quot;R v Walker&quot; trial) for posting fictional written material to the Internet allegedly describing the kidnap, rape and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud.

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution gives protection to written fiction, although the legal presumption that it does not protect obscene literature has never been overcome. Instead, pornography has successfully been defined legally as non-obscene, or &quot;obscene&quot; been shown to be so vague a term as to be unenforceable. In 1998 Brian Dalton was charged with creation and possession of child pornography under an Ohio obscenity law. The stories were works of fiction concerning sexually abusing children which he wrote and kept, unpublished, in his private journal. He accepted a plea bargain, pleaded guilty and was convicted. Five years later, the conviction was vacated.

Importing books and texts across national borders can sometimes be subject to more stringent laws than in the nations concerned. Customs officers are often permitted to seize even merely &#x27;indecent&#x27; works that would be perfectly legal to sell and possess once one is inside the nations concerned. Canada has been implicated in such border seizures.

Although the Obscene Publications Act of 1857, as well as 1959 legislation, outlawed the publication, retail and trafficking of certain types of writings and images regarded as pornographic, and would order the destruction of shop and warehouse stock meant for sale, the private possession of and viewing of pornography was not prosecuted in those times. In some nations, even purely textual erotic literature is still deemed illegal and is also prosecuted.

<text>Intellectual giftedness is an intellectual ability significantly higher than average and is also known as high potential. It is a characteristic of children, variously defined, that motivates differences in school programming. It is thought to persist as a trait into adult life, with various consequences studied in longitudinal studies of giftedness over the last century. These consequences sometimes include stigmatizing and social exclusion. There is no generally agreed definition of giftedness for either children or adults, but most school placement decisions and most longitudinal studies over the course of individual lives have followed people with IQs in the top 2.5 percent of the population—that is, IQs above 130. Definitions of giftedness also vary across cultures.

The various definitions of intellectual giftedness include either general high ability or specific abilities. For example, by some definitions, an intellectually gifted person may have a striking talent for mathematics without equally strong language skills. In particular, the relationship between artistic ability or musical ability and the high academic ability usually associated with high IQ scores is still being explored, with some authors referring to all of those forms of high ability as &quot;giftedness&quot;, while other authors distinguish &quot;giftedness&quot; from &quot;talent&quot;. There is still much controversy and much research on the topic of how adult performance unfolds from trait differences in childhood, and what educational and other supports best help the development of adult giftedness.

==Identification==
===Overview===
The identification of giftedness first emerged after the development of IQ tests for school placement. It has since become an important issue for schools, as the instruction of gifted students often presents special challenges. During the twentieth century, gifted children were often classified via IQ tests; other identification procedures have been proposed but are only used in a minority of cases in most public schools in the English-speaking world. Developing useful identification procedures for students who could benefit from a more challenging school curriculum is an ongoing problem in school administration.

Because of the key role that gifted education programs in schools play in the identification of gifted individuals, both children and adults, it is worthwhile to examine how schools define the term &quot;gifted&quot;.

=== Definitions ===
Since Lewis Terman in 1916, psychometricians and psychologists have sometimes equated giftedness with high IQ. Later researchers (e.g., Raymond Cattell, J. P. Guilford, and Louis Leon Thurstone) have argued that intellect cannot be expressed in such a unitary manner, and have suggested more multifaceted approaches to intelligence.

Research conducted in the 1980s and 1990s has provided data that supports notions of multiple components to intelligence. This is particularly evident in the reexamination of &quot;giftedness&quot; by Sternberg and Davidson in their collection of articles &quot;Conceptions of Giftedness&quot; (1986; second edition 2005). The many different conceptions of giftedness presented, although distinct, are interrelated in several ways. Most of the investigators define giftedness in terms of multiple qualities, not all of which are intellectual. IQ scores are often viewed as inadequate measures of giftedness. Motivation, high self-concept, and creativity are key qualities in many of these broadened conceptions of giftedness.

Joseph Renzulli&#x27;s (1978) &quot;three ring&quot; definition of giftedness is one frequently mentioned conceptualization of giftedness. Renzulli&#x27;s definition, which defines gifted behaviors rather than gifted individuals, is composed of three components as follows: Gifted behavior consists of behaviors that reflect an interaction among three basic clusters of human traits—above average ability, high levels of task commitment, and high levels of creativity. Individuals capable of developing gifted behavior are those possessing or capable of developing this composite set of traits and applying them to any potentially valuable area of human performance. Persons who manifest or are capable of developing an interaction among the three clusters require a wide variety of educational opportunities and services that are not ordinarily provided through regular instructional programs.

In &quot;Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide&quot;, Susan K. Johnsen explains that gifted children all exhibit the potential for high performance in the areas included in the United States&#x27; federal definition of gifted and talented students:

There is a federal government statutory definition of gifted and talented students in the United States.

This definition has been adopted partially or completely by the majority of the individual states in the United States (which have the main responsibility for education policy as compared to the federal government). Most states have a definition similar to that used in the State of Texas:

The major characteristics of these definitions are (a) the diversity of areas in which performance may be exhibited (e.g., intellectual, creativity, artistic, leadership, academically), (b) the comparison with other groups (e.g., those in general education classrooms or of the same age, experience, or environment), and (c) the use of terms that imply a need for development of the gift (e.g., capability and potential).

Another understanding of giftedness is that of asynchronous development. This asynchrony has also been referred to as “dyssynchrony” (Terrassier 1985). It can be within the person; where the child has distinctly different development levels socially, emotionally, physically, or even between different academic areas. It can also be asynchrony between the child and their social and/or academic environment.

The Columbus Group came together in 1991 to talk about their concerns that the current trends in gifted education focused overwhelmingly on achievement and the future impact these students could have on the world, and were missing focusing on and valuing who those children are in the moment, and what their lived experiences were like. They created a definition of giftedness that centers around asynchrony and intensity, which first appeared in print in an article titled “Giftedness: The View from Within” (Morelock, 1992). It states that:“Giftedness is asynchronous development in which advanced cognitive abilities and heightened intensity combine to create inner experiences and awareness that are qualitatively different from the norm. This asynchrony increases with higher intellectual capacity. The uniqueness of the gifted renders them particularly vulnerable and requires modifications in parenting, teaching and counseling in order for them to develop optimally.”This definition shares many commonalities with the definitions above, but also emphasizes the parenting and counseling differences gifted students may need to be fully supported.

=== Neuroscience of giftedness ===
Since the late 90s, the development of the brain of people with high IQ scores has been shown to be different to that of people with average IQ scores. A longitudinal study over 6 years has shown that high-IQ children have a thinner cerebral cortex when young, which then grows quickly and becomes significantly thicker than the other children&#x27;s by the time they become teenagers.

=== Identification methods ===

In psychology, identification of giftedness is usually based on IQ scores. The threshold of IQ = 130 is defined by statistical rarity. By convention, the 5% of scores who fall more than two standard deviations from the mean (or more accurately 1.96) are considered atypical. In the case of intelligence, these 5% are partitioned to both sides of the range of scores, and include the 2.5% who score more than two standard deviations below the mean and the 2.5% who score more than two standard deviations above the mean. Because the average of IQ is 100 and its standard deviation is 15, this rule places the threshold for intellectual disability at IQ = 70, and the symmetrical threshold for giftedness at IQ = 130 (rounded). This arbitrary threshold is used by most psychologists in most countries.

While IQ testing has the advantage of providing a standardised basis for the diagnosis of giftedness, psychologists are expected to interpret IQ scores in the context of all available information: standardized intelligence tests ignore actual achievement and can fail to detect giftedness. For example, a specific learning disorder such as dyslexia or dyspraxia can easily decrease scores on intelligence tests and hide true intellectual ability.

In educational settings, many schools in the US use a variety of assessments of students&#x27; capability and potential when identifying gifted children. These may include portfolios of student work, classroom observations, achievement tests, and IQ test scores. Most educational professionals accept that no single criterion can be used in isolation to accurately identify a gifted child.

One of the criteria used in identification may be an IQ test score. Until the late 1960s, when &quot;giftedness&quot; was defined solely based on an IQ score, a school district simply set an arbitrary score (usually in the 130 range) and a student either did or did not &quot;make the cut&quot;. This method is still used by many school districts because it is simple and objective. Although a high IQ score is not the sole indicator of giftedness, usually if a student has a very high IQ, that is a significant indicator of high academic potential. Because of this consideration, if a student scores highly on an IQ test, but performs at an average or below-average level academically, school officials may think that this issue warrants further investigation as an example of underachievement. However, scholars of educational testing point out that a test-taker&#x27;s scores on any two tests may vary, so a lower score on an achievement test than on an IQ test neither necessarily indicates that the test-taker is underachieving nor necessarily that the school curriculum is under-challenging.

IQ classification varies from one publisher to another. IQ tests have poor reliability for determining test-takers&#x27; rank order at higher IQ levels, and are perhaps only effective at determining whether a student is gifted rather than distinguishing among levels of giftedness. The Wechsler test manuals have standard score ceilings of 160. However, higher ceilings, including scores into the exceptionally and profoundly gifted range, exist for the WISC-IV and WISC-V, which were specifically normed on large samples of gifted children. Today, the Wechsler child and adult IQ tests are by far the most commonly used IQ tests in hospitals, schools, and private psychological practice. Older versions of the Stanford-Binet test, now obsolete, and the Cattell IQ test purport to yield IQ scores of 180 or higher, but those scores are not comparable to scores on currently normed tests. The Stanford-Binet Third Revision (Form L-M) yields consistently higher numerical scores for the same test-taker than scores obtained on current tests. This has prompted some authors on identification of gifted children to promote the Stanford-Binet form L-M, which has long been obsolete, as the only test with a sufficient ceiling to identify the exceptionally and profoundly gifted, despite the Stanford-Binet L-M never having been normed on a representative national sample. Because the instrument is outdated, current results derived from the Stanford-Binet L-M generate inflated and inaccurate scores. The IQ assessment of younger children remains debated.

While many people believe giftedness is a strictly quantitative difference, measurable by IQ tests, some authors on the &quot;experience of being&quot; have described giftedness as a fundamentally different way of perceiving the world, which in turn affects every experience had by the gifted individual. This view is doubted by some scholars who have closely studied gifted children longitudinally.

=== Across cultures ===
Characteristics and attributes associated with giftedness varies across cultures. While intelligence is extremely important in Western and some other cultures, such an emphasis is not consistent throughout the world. For example, in Japan, there is more of a value placed on an individual&#x27;s motivation and diligence. When Japanese students are given a task, they attribute success to factors like effort, whereas American students tend to attribute success to ability. Similarly, when Japanese students fail, they refer the failure to lack of effort. On the other hand, American students believe failure is due to a lack of ability. There are conceptions in rural Kenya that identify four types of intelligence: initiative (paro), knowledge and skills (rieko), respect (luoro), and comprehension of how to handle real-life problems (winjo). Chan cites the Chinese belief that aspects of giftedness are innate, but that people can become gifted through industriousness, perseverance, and learning. Not all who are intellectually gifted display every noticeable characteristic.

There are many reasons gifted students who have various backgrounds are not as successful at Western intelligence/achievement tests:

*Not used to answering questions just for the purpose of showing knowledge – they must use their knowledge to respond to authentic problems.
*May perform poorly on paper-and-pencil tasks in an artificial lab setting.
*May perform poorly on a culturally biased test, especially if not their own.
*Have test anxiety or suffer from stereotype threat.

Many traits that demonstrate intellectual giftedness are identified across a multitude of cultures, such as:

*Displaying advanced reasoning and creative thinking, generating ideas beyond the norm
*Resourceful and adaptable
*Strongly motivated to understand the world
*Well developed vocabulary in native language
*Learns concepts quickly, and builds/develops these concepts
*Strong sense of justice and morality
*Displays leadership skills in various ways, such as persuasion, taking initiative, and leading by example
*Comprehending and using humor beyond their age

==Developmental theory==
Gifted children may develop asynchronously: their minds are often ahead of their physical growth, and specific cognitive and emotional functions are often developed differently (or to differing extents) at different stages of development. One frequently cited example of asynchronicity in early cognitive development is Albert Einstein, who was delayed in speech, but whose later fluency and accomplishments belied this initial delay. Psychologist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker theorized that, rather than viewing Einstein&#x27;s (and other famously gifted late-talking individuals) adult accomplishments as existing distinct from, or in spite of, his early language deficits, and rather than viewing Einstein&#x27;s lingual delay itself as a &quot;disorder&quot;, it may be that Einstein&#x27;s genius and his delay in speaking were developmentally intrinsic to one another.

It has been said that gifted children may advance more quickly through stages established by post-Freudian developmentalists such as Jean Piaget. Gifted individuals also experience the world differently, resulting in certain social and emotional issues.

Francoy Gagne&#x27;s (2000) &quot;Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent&quot; (DMGT) is a developmental theory that distinguishes giftedness from talent, offering explanation on how outstanding natural abilities (gifts) develop into specific expert skills (talents). According to DMGT theory, &quot;one cannot become talented without first being gifted, or almost so&quot;. There are six components that can interact in countless and unique ways that foster the process of moving from having natural abilities (giftedness) to systematically developed skills.

These components consist of the &quot;gift&quot; (G) itself, &quot;chance&quot; (C), &quot;environmental catalyst&quot; (EC), &quot;intrapersonal catalyst&quot; (IC), &quot;learning/practice&quot; (LP) and the outcome of &quot;talent&quot; (T). It is important to know that (C), (IC), and (EC) can facilitate but can also hinder the learning and training of becoming talented. The learning/practice is the moderator. It is through the interactions, both environmental and intrapersonal that influence the process of learning and practice along with/without chance that natural abilities are transformed into talents.

== Multiple intelligences theory ==

Multiple intelligences has been associated with giftedness or overachievement of some developmental areas (Colangelo, 2003). Multiple intelligences has been described as an attitude towards learning, instead of techniques or strategies (Cason, 2001).

Howard Gardner proposed in &quot;Frames of Mind&quot; (Gardner 1983/1994) that intellectual giftedness may be present in areas other than the typical intellectual realm. The concept of Multiple Intelligences (MI) makes the field aware of additional potential strengths and proposes a variety of curricular methods. Gardner argued that there are eight intelligences, or different areas in which people assimilate or learn about the world around them: interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, naturalistic, and spatial-visual.

The most common criticism of Gardner&#x27;s MI theory is &quot;the belief by scholars that each of the seven multiple intelligences is a cognitive style rather than a stand-alone construct&quot;. Others consider the theory not to be sufficiently empirical. This perspective has also been criticized on the grounds that it is &quot;ad hoc&quot;: that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word &quot;intelligence&quot;, but rather denies the existence of intelligence as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word &quot;intelligence&quot; where other people have traditionally used words like &quot;ability&quot; and &quot;aptitude&quot;.

Identification of gifted students with MI is a challenge since there is no simple test to determine the giftedness of MI. Assessing by observation is potentially most accurate, but potentially highly subjective. MI theory can be applied to not only gifted students, but it can be a lens through which all students can be assessed. This more global perspective may lead to more child-centered instruction and meet the needs of a greater number of children (Colangelo, 2003).

== Savantism ==
Savants are individuals who perform exceptionally in a single field of learning. More often, the terms &quot;savant&quot; and &quot;savantism&quot; describe people with a competence level in a single field of learning well beyond what is considered normal, even among the gifted community. Such individuals are alternatively termed &quot;idiot savants ─&quot; a term that has been mentioned as early as the eighteenth century. &quot;Autistic savantism&quot; refers to the exceptional abilities occasionally exhibited by people with autism or other pervasive developmental disorders. These abilities often come with below-age-level functioning in most, if not all areas of skilled performance. The term was introduced in a 1978 article in &quot;Psychology Today&quot; describing this condition. It is also proposed that there are savants with normal or superior IQ such as those with Asperger syndrome, who demonstrate special abilities involving numbers, mathematics, mechanical, and spatial skills.

== Gifted minority students in the United States ==

The majority of students enrolled in gifted programs are White; Black and Hispanic students constitute a smaller proportion than their enrollment in school. For example, statistics from 1993 indicate that in the U.S., Black students represented 16.2% of public school students, but only constituted 8.4% of students enrolled in gifted education programs. Similarly, while Hispanic students represented 9% of public school students, these students only represented 4.7% of those identified as gifted. However, Asian students make up only 3.6% of the student body, yet constitute 14% in the gifted programs. Poor students are also underrepresented in gifted programs, even more than Black and Hispanic students are.

Lack of equity and access in programs for the gifted has been acknowledged since the early twentieth century. In the 1920s, research by Lillian Steele Proctor pointed to systemic racism as a contributor to the relative invisibility of gifted African American youth. In their 2004 study, &quot;Addressing the Achievement Gap Between Minority and Nonminority Children by Increasing Access to Gifted Programs&quot; Olszewski-Kubilius et al. write that minority students are &quot;less likely to be nominated by teachers as potential candidates for gifted programs and, if nominated, are less likely to be selected for the program, particularly when such traditional measures as I.Q. and achievement tests are used for identification.&quot;

This underrepresentation of such students in gifted programs is attributed to a multiplicity of factors including cultural bias of testing procedures, selective referrals and educator bias, and reliance on deficit-based paradigms. To address the inequities in assessment procedures, researchers suggest the use of multiple tests and alternative methods of testing, such as performance-based assessment measures, oral-expressiveness measures as well as non-verbal ability assessments (such as Naglieri Nonverbal Abilities Tests (NNAT) or Raven&#x27;s Matrix Analogies Tests).

According to 2013-2014 data collected by the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education, White students have more opportunities and exposure to attending schools that offer gifted and talented education programs (GATE) than racial and ethnic minority students, specifically Black and Latino students. Data collected by the Office of Civil Rights department of the Department of Education also reveal that racial/ethnic minority students are underrepresented in gifted and talented education programs. Forty-nine percent of all students enrolled in schools that offer GATE programs are White, whereas 42% of all students enrolled in schools that offer GATE programs are Latino and Black, thus revealing that white people have more opportunities to be a part of a school that offers GATE programs. Within GATE programs, 29% of the students are Latino and Black, and 57% are White (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).

Weinstein (2002) suggests that some teachers recommend racial minority studentswith the exception of Asian studentsto special education and remedial classes more often than gifted and talented classes due to teacher expectancy biases placed on racial minority students. Teachers&#x27; expectations of their students&#x27; academic performance influence how students perceive themselves. If a teacher expects more success academically from specific students, those students are prone to displaying behavior and work ethic that will set them apart from others in a positive light, whereas if a teacher only expects the bare minimum from his or her students, those students will merely do what is expected of them (Weinstein, 2002).

Racial minority students who are perceived as being disadvantaged from their peers in regards to socioeconomic status tend to have less supportive relations with their teachers (Fitzpatrick, 2015). Due to this lack of support, teachers do not expect these disadvantaged students to go above and beyond, therefore they are often overlooked when it is time for gifted and talented education program nominations. Research suggests that teacher expectancy bias can also be diminished by matching the racial demographics of students to that of teachers. Gershenson and colleagues (2016) found that non-Black teachers held low expectations of their black students, specifically in relation to black male students and math, whereas Black teachers held high expectations of black male students in regards to math. This finding suggests that racial diversity among educators is a positive step toward diminishing teacher expectancy bias.

Weinstein and colleagues (1991) aimed to change the low expectations attached to racial minority students of an urban high school that placed many Black and Latino students in remedial programs rather than college preparatory or honor classes. The study aimed to prepare these racial minority students for college-level academic work while attending high school. With positive teacher attitudes toward students and greater teacher self-efficacy, the students who were once on track to being recommended for remedial classes were performing at advanced academic levels after 2 years of intervention. They were also more heavily involved in leadership roles at their high school. This study supports the claim that teacher expectancy contributes to how a student sees him or herself in regards to achievements (Weinstein et al., 1991).

Gifted students of color experience success when multicultural content is incorporated in the curriculum and furthermore when the curriculum itself is designed to be culturally and linguistically compatible. A culturally diverse curriculum and instruction encourages gifted minority students to experience a sense of belonging and validation as scholars. Furthermore, the educator&#x27;s role in this process is significant as Lee et al. argue that &quot;[t]eacher awareness and understanding of students&#x27; racial and cultural differences and their ability to incorporate multicultural perspectives into curricular content and instructional techniques may counter gifted minority students&#x27; discomfort in being one of the few minority students in gifted programs.&quot;

== Twice-exceptional ==

The term twice-exceptional was coined by James J. Gallagher to denote students who are both gifted and have disabilities. In other words, twice-exceptional students are those who have two special needs. For instance, they might have gifted learning needs and a learning disability. Or, they may be a gifted learner and have a developmental disability, such as autism spectrum disorder.

People have known about twice-exceptional students for decades; however, identification and program strategies remain ambiguous. These students represent a unique challenge for the educational system. Teachers and educators will need to make special accommodations for their learning deficits (such as remediation), yet adapt the curriculum to meet their advanced learning needs (for instance, through acceleration or enrichment). Twice-exceptional students are considered to be at risk because they are hidden within the general population of their educational environment, and often viewed as either underachievers or average learners.

Early identification and intervention is critical; however, giftedness in the twice-exceptional population is often identified later than in the average population as it is masked by the disability. The disabilities may include auditory processing weaknesses, sensory-motor integration issues, visual perceptual difficulties, spatial disorientation, dyslexia, and attention deficits. Recognition of learning difficulties among the gifted is made extremely difficult by virtue of their ability to compensate. Among the signs that the student may be twice-exceptional are apparent inconsistencies between abilities and results, deficits in short-term memory and attention, and negative behaviors such as being sarcastic, negative, or aggressive.

A child prodigy who demonstrates qualities to be twice-exceptional may encounter additional difficulties. With insight at a young age, it is possible for them to be constantly aware of the risk of failure. This can be detrimental to their emotional state and academic achievement. If a child comprehends a subject well, but due to a developmental disorder receives poor grades in a subject, the child may have difficulty understanding why there is little success in that subject.

== Social and emotional development ==
Research over the years has shown mixed results when looking at the psychological well-being of gifted children, according to a 1999 review of research by Neihart. The timeline of research into the impact of giftedness on mental health shows swings from the view point that it increases risk in the late 19th century to Terman&#x27;s research that the gifted experienced fewer adjustment issues than others. In 1981, a gifted high school student died of suicide and &quot;the phrase, &#x27;social and emotional needs of the gifted&#x27; was coined.&quot; (Neihart, 1999, p.10). This event also sparked the birth of the organization SENG, founded by Dr. James T. Webb, as a way to support and educate the gifted community about these needs.

A 2016 review of research facilitated by the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) in the United States continues to show that, as a whole, gifted children and young adults are not more susceptible to social and emotional challenges than their typically developing peers. That does not mean, however, that there is nothing special to consider when we are looking to support gifted individuals on their developmental journey.

Asynchrony, as is included in the Columbus Group definition of giftedness above (Morelock, 1992), can manifest as differences in the social and emotional development of gifted students as compared to typically developing peers, and cause them to be “out of step” with others even in a gifted setting. This can lead to challenges for the child that need to be addressed for them to fully develop socially and emotionally. 

=== Isolation ===
Social isolation is a common trait in gifted individuals, especially those with no social network of gifted peers. In order to gain popularity, gifted children will often try to hide their abilities to win social approval. Strategies include underachievement (discussed below) and the use of less sophisticated vocabulary when among same-age peers than when among family members or other trusted individuals.

Some believe that the isolation experienced by gifted individuals is not caused by giftedness itself, but by society&#x27;s response to giftedness and to the rarity of peers. Plucker and Levy have noted that, &quot;in this culture, there appears to be a great pressure for people to be &#x27;normal&#x27; with a considerable stigma associated with giftedness or talent.&quot; To counteract this problem, gifted education professionals recommend creating a peer group based on common interests and abilities. The earlier this occurs, the more effective it is likely to be in preventing isolation. Since the mid-1940s, several high-IQ societies of varying levels of selectivity have been established to help gifted individuals find intellectual peers, the oldest ones being Mensa and Intertel, established in 1946 and 1966 respectively.

Some research suggests that mathematically gifted adolescents might have deficiencies in social valuation and mentalization, while gifted adolescents in general may struggle with social adaptive learning, but these conclusions are not supported by a large literature.

===Perfectionism===
Perfectionism, while considered to have many positive aspects, can be another issue for gifted individuals. It is encouraged by the fact that gifted individuals tend to be easily successful in much of what they do.

&quot;Healthy perfectionism&quot; refers to having high standards, a desire to achieve, conscientiousness, or high levels of responsibility. It is likely to be a virtue rather than a problem, even if gifted children may have difficulty with healthy perfectionism because they set standards that would be appropriate to their mental age (the level at which they think), but they cannot always meet them because they are bound to a younger body, or the social environment is restrictive. In such cases, outsiders may call some behavior perfectionism, while for the gifted this may simply be their standard. It has been said that perfectionism &quot;becomes desirable when it stimulates the healthy pursuit of excellence.&quot;

Some believe that perfectionism can be unhealthy. &quot;Unhealthy perfectionism&quot; stems from equating one&#x27;s worth as a human being to one&#x27;s achievements, and the simultaneous belief that any work less than perfect is unacceptable and will lead to criticism. Because perfection in the majority of human activities is neither desirable, nor possible, this cognitive distortion creates self-doubt, performance anxiety, and ultimately procrastination.

Unhealthy perfectionism can be triggered or further exacerbated by parents, siblings, or classmates with good or ill intentions. Parents are usually proud and will extensively praise the gifted child. On the other hand, siblings, peers, and school bullies may generally become jealous or envious of the intellectual ease of the gifted child and tease him or her about any minor imperfection in his or her work, strength, clothes, appearance, or behavior. Either approach—positive reinforcement from parents or negative reactions from siblings and peers for minor flaws—may push gifted children into equating their worth amongst their peers to their own abilities; thus, any imperfection could be viewed as a serious defect in themselves. This unhealthy perfectionism can be further exaggerated when the child counters bullying with the same tactics (i.e., insulting the less exceptional abilities of others), thus creating further disdain in himself for low or even average performance.

There are many theories that try to explain the correlation between perfectionism and giftedness. Perfectionism can become a problem as it frustrates and inhibits achievements.

D. E. Hamachek identified six specific, overlapping types of behavior associated with perfectionism. They are:

* Depression
* A nagging &quot;I should&quot; feeling
* Shame and guilt feelings
* Face-saving behavior
* Shyness and procrastination
* Self-deprecation

===Underachievement===
Underachievement is a significant issue for gifted learners. There is often a stark gap between the abilities of the gifted individual and their actual accomplishments. Many gifted students will perform extremely well on standardized or reasoning tests, only to fail a class exam. It is estimated that half of gifted children do not perform in school at a level that is up to their abilities. Studies of high school dropouts in the United States estimate that between 18% and 25% of gifted students fail to graduate. This disparity can result from various factors, such as loss of interest in classes that are too easy or negative social consequences of being perceived as smart. Underachievement can also result from emotional or psychological factors, including depression, anxiety, perfectionism, low self esteem, or self-sabotage.

An often-overlooked contributor to underachievement is undiagnosed learning differences. A gifted individual is less likely to be diagnosed with a learning disorder than a non-gifted classmate, as the gifted child can more readily compensate for their paucities. This masking effect is dealt with by understanding that a difference of one standard deviation between scores constitutes a learning disability even if all of the scores are above average. Assessments may also fail to identify some gifted students entirely because their underachieving behaviours keep them from being recognized as exceptional.

Some gifted children may not be aware that they are gifted. One apparently effective way to attempt to reverse underachievement in gifted children includes educating teachers to provide enrichment projects based on students&#x27; strengths and interests without attracting negative attention from peers. Other methods include matching the underachiever with an achieving role model, correcting skill deficiencies and ensuring that proper assessments are in place to identify all learning issues with underachieving students.

===Depression===
It has been thought in the past that there is a correlation between giftedness and depression. This is not an established research finding. As Reis and Renzulli mention, 
With the exception of creatively gifted adolescents who are talented in writing or the visual arts, studies do not confirm that gifted individuals manifest significantly higher or lower rates or severity of depression than those for the general population. Gifted children&#x27;s advanced cognitive abilities, social isolation, sensitivity, and uneven development may cause them to face some challenging social and emotional issues, but their problem-solving abilities, advanced social skills, moral reasoning, out-of-school interests, and satisfaction in achievement may help them to be more resilient.
There is also no research that points to suicide attempt rates being higher in gifted adolescents than other adolescents.

<doc id="398472" wikidata="Q6937852" url="?curid=398472" title="Murder of Dru Sjodin">
<text>The murder of Dru Sjodin, a 22-year-old student at the University of North Dakota and Gamma Phi Beta sorority member, occurred on November 22, 2003. Sjodin was kidnapped by Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. from the Columbia Mall parking lot in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Rodriguez Jr. took Sjodin to the North Dakota and Minnesota state lines, where he murdered her and left her body in Crookston, Minnesota. 

In August 2006, Rodriguez Jr. was found guilty of kidnapping resulting in death of Dru Sjodin in a federal court. Rodriguez Jr. was sentenced to death, however, his death sentence was appealed and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Her disappearance and murder attracted national attention, and generated extensive media coverage. Sjodin&#x27;s murder prompted the creation of the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Registry, an unprecedented public safety resource that provides the public with access to sex offender data nationwide. 

== Murder ==
At 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, November 22, 2003, Dru Katrina Sjodin (born September 26, 1981) finished her shift at the Victoria&#x27;s Secret store located in the Columbia Mall in Grand Forks, North Dakota. After shopping for and purchasing a new purse from Marshall Field&#x27;s, Sjodin left the mall and began walking to her 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass. During this time, Sjodin was speaking with her boyfriend, Chris Lang, on her cell phone. Four minutes into their conversation, Lang reports Sjodin was saying &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; before the call abruptly ended. Lang suspected that the call was just dropped and because Sjodin didn&#x27;t give any sense of urgency, Lang thought nothing of it. About three hours later, Lang received another call from her cell phone, but heard only static and the sound of buttons being pressed. It was reported by authorities this second phone call originated somewhere near Fisher, Minnesota, but that has remained unsubstantiated. With this second call and Sjodin not showing up at her other job at the El Roco nightclub, there was concern for her whereabouts.
A week later, on December 1, a suspect, 50-year-old registered level-3 sex offender Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. (born February 18, 1953), was arrested in connection with Sjodin&#x27;s disappearance.

==Perpetrator==
Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. was the son of migrant farm workers Dolores and Alfonso Rodriguez Sr., who traveled between Crystal City, Texas, and Minnesota and then decided to settle in 1963 in Crookston, Minnesota. He admitted to using many drugs during his youth and committed his first sexual assault with a knife when he was 21 by attempting to rape a woman he asked to give him a ride home.

Rodriguez had been released from prison May 1, 2003, after serving a 23-year prison term for rape, aggravated assault and kidnapping a woman. Rodriguez had also previously pleaded guilty to rape and was convicted multiple times for rape. He had a long criminal record that included repeated sexual assaults against women. He was released as a Minnesota Level 3 sex offender which meant he was highly likely to reoffend.

===Police investigation===
Police reports indicate that Rodriguez claimed to have been near Columbia Mall on the evening of Sjodin&#x27;s disappearance, reportedly watching &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; at the Columbia Mall Cinema 4. This claim was disproven as the film was not screening at that cinema or any other local theater at the time. Further investigations revealed receipts from Rodriguez&#x27;s purchases at various stores around the mall, including one from a nearby Menards store for a knife. Notably, Rodriguez possessed two specific tool kit knives available only at a certain home center store located approximately a mile from the mall. These knives, however, were not purchased on the day Sjodin vanished, and their exact purchase date remains unknown. In Rodriguez&#x27;s car, police found one of these tool kit knives submerged in a cleaning solution in the rear wheel well. Additionally, a woman&#x27;s shoe and another knife with blood matching Sjodin&#x27;s DNA were discovered in the vehicle.

Sjodin&#x27;s body was recovered on April 17, 2004, just west of Crookston, Minnesota, when deep snow drifts began to melt. Crookston is also where Rodriguez lived with his mother. Sjodin&#x27;s body was found partially nude and face down in a ravine. Her hands were tied behind her back; she had been beaten, stabbed, and sexually assaulted, and had several lacerations including a five-and-a-half inch cut on her neck. A rope was also tied around her neck and remnants of a shopping bag were found under the rope, suggesting that a bag had been placed on her head. The medical examiner concluded that she had either died as a result of the major neck wound, from suffocation, or from exposure to the elements. Thousands of people had helped search for Sjodin, and hundreds attended her funeral.

===Trial and sentencing===
Because Sjodin had been taken across state lines, the crime became a federal case under the Federal Kidnapping Act. This meant that Rodriguez was eligible to receive the death penalty if convicted, a possibility not allowed under North Dakota or Minnesota law, as neither state has the death penalty. It was the first death penalty case in a century to take place in North Dakota. U.S. Attorney Drew Wrigley and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Keith Reisenauer and Norman Anderson prosecuted the case against Rodriguez. On August 30, 2006, Rodriguez was convicted in federal court of kidnapping resulting in death for the murder of Dru Sjodin, and on September 22, 2006, the jury recommended that he receive the death penalty. On February 8, 2007, Rodriguez was formally sentenced to death by U.S District Judge Ralph R. Erickson. He is imprisoned at the United States Penitentiary, Coleman in Florida. Judge Erickson arranged that Rodriguez would be executed in South Dakota.

In October 2011, defense attorneys filed a federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot; motion claiming that Rodriguez is mentally disabled. On June 28, 2013, Rodriguez admitted his guilt in a death row interview with Dr. Michael Welner.

===Appeals===
In 2021, the same judge who sentenced Rodriguez to death, Ralph R. Erickson, now a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, overturned his sentence and ordered that a new sentencing phase be conducted due to &quot;misleading testimony from a medical examiner and limitations on mental health evidence&quot;. The testimony in court of Michael McGee, the Ramsey County Medical Examiner, was “unreliable, misleading and inaccurate” and that Rodriguez&#x27;s attorneys did him a disservice by opting to limit the mental health evaluation of Rodriguez which could have resulted in the possible use of the insanity defense by their client.

On March 14, 2023, prosecutors announced that they would no longer seek the death penalty for Rodriguez. Rodriguez was sentenced to life without parole on May 18, 2023.

== Legacy ==
Legislation dubbed &quot;Dru&#x27;s Law&quot;, which set up the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Registry, was passed in 2006 and signed into law by President George W. Bush. The Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website (NSOPW) is an unprecedented public safety resource that provides the public with access to sex offender data nationwide. NSOPW is a partnership between the U.S. Department of Justice and state, territorial and tribal governments, working together for the safety of adults and children. 

In 2004, a scholarship in Sjodin&#x27;s name was set up at the University of North Dakota.

A memorial garden for Sjodin opened in her hometown of Pequot Lakes, Minnesota, and another is planned for the UND campus.

<doc id="398476" wikidata="Q903926" url="?curid=398476" title="Metamictisation">
<text>Metamictisation (sometimes called metamictization or metamiction) is a natural process resulting in the gradual and ultimately complete destruction of a mineral&#x27;s crystal structure, leaving the mineral amorphous. The affected material is therefore described as metamict.

Certain minerals occasionally contain interstitial impurities of radioactive elements, and it is the alpha radiation emitted from those compounds that is responsible for degrading a mineral&#x27;s crystal structure through internal bombardment. The effects of metamictisation are extensive: other than negating any birefringence previously present, the process also lowers a mineral&#x27;s refractive index, hardness, and its specific gravity. The mineral&#x27;s colour is also affected: metamict specimens are usually green, brown or blackish. Further, metamictisation diffuses the bands of a mineral&#x27;s absorption spectrum. Curiously and inexplicably, the one attribute which metamictisation does not alter is dispersion. All metamict materials are themselves radioactive, some dangerously so.

An example of a metamict mineral is zircon. The presence of uranium and thorium atoms substituting for zirconium in the crystal structure is responsible for the radiation damage in this case. Unaffected specimens are termed &quot;high zircon&quot; while metamict specimens are termed &quot;low zircon&quot;. Other minerals known to undergo metamictisation include allanite, gadolinite, ekanite, thorite and titanite. Ekanite is almost invariably found completely metamict as thorium and uranium are part of its essential chemical composition.

Metamict minerals can have their crystallinity and properties restored through prolonged annealing.

A related phenomenon is the formation of pleochroic halos surrounding minute zircon inclusions within a crystal of biotite or other mineral. The spherical halos are produced by alpha particle radiation from the included uranium- or thorium-bearing species. Such halos can also be found surrounding monazite and other radioactive minerals.

<doc id="398477" wikidata="Q3586936" url="?curid=398477" title="List of British Columbia general elections">
<text>Elections to the unicameral legislative body of the Canadian province of British Columbia, the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, are held every four years. Fixed election dates for the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, occurring every four years, were instituted in 2002, after the &quot;Constitution (Fixed Election Dates) Amendment Act (SBC 2001 c.36)&quot; was passed in 2001. The regular election date for the Legislative Assembly is set to occur on the third Saturday in October in the fourth calendar year after the previous election, with the next election scheduled on or before October 21, 2028.

The number of seats has increased over time, from 25 for the first election in 1871, to the current 87.

Every election from 1871 to 1986 elected a portion of its MLAs from multi-member constituencies, usually two-member constituencies. Voters in these districts had as many votes as there were seats (block-voting), and generally the party with the most supporters in the district filled all the seats, with no representation left for the others. This generally helped ensure the sitting government&#x27;s capture of the most seats. (It also makes the &quot;popular vote&quot;, the votes cast, not truly reflective of the sentiment of the voters, due to some voters casting two (or more votes) and others only one.)

Until the 1903 election, British Columbia politics were officially non-partisan – political parties were not part of the official process. One of the first parties to be noticed in BC politics, the Nationalist Party espoused &quot;National Socialism&quot;, based on Edward Bellamy&#x27;s writings, and favoured nationalization of industry. Its candidate Robert Macpherson was elected MLA in 1894 and 1898.

The general non-partisanship changed in the 1898 and 1900 elections with the official listing of party candidates, and federal political parties were recognized in the provincial election of 1903. The first elections held along party lines (1903–1941) were primarily contested by the Conservative Party (which won five elections during this period) and the Liberal Party (which won six elections).

For three terms during and immediately after World War II, the legislature was managed by a coalition government between the Conservatives and the Liberals. The Social Credit Party dominated elections from 1952 to 1986, winning eleven of the twelve elections (the single exception a NDP victory). Provincial politics since 1986 have been dominated by the New Democratic Party (NDP) which won both elections held in the 1990s, and by the Liberal Party, which won the 2001 election and the next three elections.

Since 2017, the government has been formed by the NDP. From 2017 to 2020, the NDP formed a minority government with a confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party. Following the 2020 election, the NDP formed a majority government.

==Absentee voting==
Contemporary elections in British Columbia use a relatively unique system of handling absentee ballots. While all jurisdictions in Canada allow for absentee voting through advance communication with the appropriate federal or provincial election agency, British Columbia is unique in allowing same-day absentee voting at any polling station in the province; ballots so cast are not counted locally on election night, however, but are sent to the voter&#x27;s home riding and counted two weeks after election day. One important effect of this is that a particularly close race, such as the nine-vote margin that initially separated the main candidates in Courtenay-Comox in the 2017 election, may not have a winner officially declared until the absentee ballots have been counted at the later date; as well, because the absentee vote tends to favour the New Democratic Party rather than the Liberal Party, a district narrowly won by the Liberals has a higher chance of being flipped by absentee voters than a narrow NDP win does.

The system exists both to serve commuters in the Greater Vancouver Area, where requiring people to vote at home frequently forced suburban districts to cope with sudden crowds of late voters at the end of the day, pushing past poll closing time and delaying the counting of the results in those areas, and because the province has a much higher than normal proportion of people who work away from home for long periods in remote natural resources sites.

==Summary of results==

===Before 1903===
Prior the 1903 election, political parties in British Columbia were not officially recognized in provincial elections. During this period, some candidates declared their support for the administration as &quot;Government&quot; candidates, while those not in support ran as &quot;Non-Government&quot; or Independent candidates. However, these pre-election alignments often did not persist once the House was seated as allegiances would frequently shift.

While there were no official party lines, there were unofficial yet unstable ones. Premiers Amor De Cosmos and Joseph Martin both sat, at various times, in the federal House of Commons as Liberals, while Premier Edward Gawler Prior sat in the House of Commons as a Conservative. There was also a clear grouping of members who would often sit in opposition to, or in the cabinet of, certain other premiers. De Cosmos and his unofficial Liberals mutually supported each other (i.e. were in each other&#x27;s cabinets). These premiers included McCreight, Walkem, Bevean, Semlin, and Martin. Meanwhile, Premiers Prior, Dunsmuir, Turner, A.E.B. Davie, Robson, Theodore Davie, Smithe, and Elliot sat in each other&#x27;s cabinets or otherwise supported one another; while premiers from one group often sat in opposition to premiers from the other.

===Since 1903===


&quot;Other&quot; encompasses Independent seats and parties that never won more than one seat in an election.

<text>UCLouvain (or Université catholique de Louvain , French for Catholic University of Louvain, officially in English the University of Louvain) is Belgium&#x27;s largest French-speaking university and one of the oldest in Europe (originally established in 1425). It is located in Louvain-la-Neuve, which was expressly built to house the university, and has smaller campuses in Brussels, Charleroi, Mons, Tournai and Namur. Since September 2018, the university uses the branding UCLouvain, replacing the acronym UCL, following a merger with Saint-Louis University, Brussels.

The original University of Louvain (&quot;Universitas Lovaniensis&quot;) was founded at the centre of the historic town of Leuven (or &quot;Louvain&quot;) in 1425, making it the first university in Belgium and the Low Countries, and abolished by law in 1797. This university was the centre of Baianism, Jansenism and Febronianism in Europe. A new university, the State University of Louvain, was founded in 1817 and abolished by the law in 1835. A new catholic university was founded in Mechlin in 1834, the &quot;Catholic&quot; University of Mechlin and moved to Leuven in 1835 that is frequently, but controversially, identified as a continuation of the older institution. In 1968 the Catholic University of Leuven split into the Dutch-language &quot;Katholieke Universiteit Leuven&quot;, which stayed in Leuven, and the French-language &quot;Université catholique de Louvain&quot;, which moved to Louvain-la-Neuve in Wallonia, 30 km southeast of Brussels. Since the 15th century, &quot;Leuven/Louvain&quot;, as it is still often called, has been a major contributor to the development of Catholic theology.

==History==
The Catholic University of Leuven, based in Leuven (&quot;Louvain&quot; in French), 30 km east of Brussels, provided lectures in French from its founding in 1834, and in Dutch from 1930. In 1968, the Dutch-language section became the independent Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, which remained in Leuven, while the French-speaking university was expelled to a greenfield campus and town, Louvain-la-Neuve, 30 km south-east of Brussels, in a part of the country where French is the official language. This separation also entailed dividing existing library holdings between the two new universities.

With the democratization of university education already stretching existing structures, plans to expand the French-speaking part of the university at a campus in Brussels or Wallonia were quietly discussed from the early 1960s, but it was not anticipated that the French-speaking section would become an entirely independent university and lose all of its buildings and infrastructure in Leuven. The first stone of the new campus at Louvain-la-Neuve was laid in 1971, and the transfer of faculties to the new site was completed in 1979.According to a 2007 agreement, the University of Louvain was to absorb three smaller French-speaking catholic colleges: the Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix (FUNDP) located in Namur, the Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis (FUSL) located in Brussels (later called Saint-Louis University, Brussels) and the Catholic university of Mons (FUCaM) located in Mons and Charleroi. The negotiations for a full merger aborted by an insufficient vote by the general assembly of the FUNDP in December 2010. The result was a merger between the University of Louvain and the FUCaM in Mons, effective from 15 September 2011. The Mons campus is denoted UCLouvain FUCaM Mons. The three universities still collaborate in consortium, the Académie Louvain. Within this group, member universities have coordinated their masters programmes in the fields of economics, management, political sciences and sciences as well as the doctoral programmes in all disciplines.

In September 2018, the University of Louvain (or UCL until then) and Saint-Louis University, Brussels &quot;de facto&quot; merged, founding the &quot;UCLouvain&quot;, a denomination they currently share.

== Chronology ==
In 1425, Dukes of Brabant created the University of Louvain (Université de Louvain), which was suppressed under Joseph II, reopened in 1790, and was finally closed under the French Republic in 1797.

In 1817, the State University of Louvain (&quot;Université de l&#x27;Etat de Louvain&quot;) was founded, which closed 15 August 1835.

In 1834, the Catholic bishops of Belgium created the Catholic University of Belgium (Université catholique de Belgique) in Mechlin, also known as the Catholic University of Malines (Université catholique de Malines).

A law passed on 27 September 1835 stated that there would be only one university funded by the State of Belgium in Louvain. The same year, shortly after the suppression of the State University, the Catholic University of Belgium moved to Louvain. It took advantage of the reputation of the city as an ancient university centre and adopted a new name: Catholic University of Louvain (Université catholique de Louvain).

In a Catholic spirit inspired by Pope Gregory XVI, the promoter and first rector of the university, Monseigneur de Ram, wanted to create a shield that would repulse religion&#x27;s enemies and block every doctrine weakening the base of Catholic society.

The pharmacy school was founded in 1845 and the engineering school in 1865.

In 1884 the Catholic University of Louvain celebrated its fiftieth anniversary.

In 1968, as a result of linguistic issues, the university was divided into two different universities: one French speaking, which moved to the province of Walloon Brabant, and one Dutch speaking, which remained in the same location.

In 1970, these two universities were established by law as the &quot;Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven&quot; and &quot;Université catholique de Louvain&quot;.

In 1971, the first foundation stone was laid in Louvain-la-Neuve, a new city constructed for the French-speaking university.

UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels also owns a classical and modern art collection, primarily paintings recovered from its original campus in Mechelen.

== Rankings ==

The University of Louvain educates around 27,261 students from 127 nationalities in all areas of studies at its different campuses. It has educated a large part of Belgium&#x27;s elite and is still considered, with its Dutch-speaking sister, as a centre of excellence in many fields. In 2006, it was ranked 76th in the world universities ranking established by the Times Higher Education supplement (24th in Europe).

In the 2011 QS World University Rankings the University of Louvain was ranked 125th overall in the world, moving up one place from its position of joint 126th in the 2009 THE–QS World University Rankings (in 2010 Times Higher Education World University Rankings and QS World University Rankings parted ways to produce separate rankings). An overview of the THE-QS Rankings:

==Student activities==

===Cercles===

&quot;Cercles&quot; are Student Societies or Fraternities based around each faculty. The Cercles, along with the Régionales (which are based around their respective regions of origin) coordinate and manage most of the students&#x27; animation and nightlife. Most Cercles run small bars to fund their activities, and also jointly operate a larger nightclub, &quot;La Casa&quot;.

Cercles and Régionales are run exclusively by member students known as the committee. These members are elected every year, usually by voting from all members (active or otherwise) wishing to participate, although some Cercles restrict the number of possible voters in some cases.

Aside from promoting student folklore and coordinating student animation, Cercles also offer academic aid to students in their respective faculties and organize more cultural activities, such as visits to museums and/or other cities, conferences, and low-cost trips for students (for example skiing in the Alps during the Winter Break).

Every Cercle and Régionale has its own customs and traditions, but some are practiced by all:

The Baptême () is a hazing ceremony used by most to induct new members, who then participate in a number of trials and activities involving eggs and other foodstuff, paint, demeaning chants etc. Baptized members (les Baptisés) are among the most common type of members, and some Cercles and Régionales try to only accept new members this way, although it is in no way an obligation to be baptized in order to be a part of a Cercle or to frequent them.

The calotte is a Belgian student cap worn by students attending Catholic universities. They are emblems of student folklore dating back to the late 19th century. Nowadays, most calottes are passed by way of a ceremony known as the coronae. How they are passed and what must be known or done to deserve it depends on the Cercle or Régionale. One thing that is universally known, is that there is a lot of singing involved.

Cercles are notorious for their generally high output of alcohol (especially beer) and low level of cleanliness. Students tend to wear old clothes that they don&#x27;t mind damaging or dirtying as a consequence, and the overall ambiance is more akin to a rave or a frat-party than a nightclub or sports bar.

===Kots===
Student accommodation in Belgium comes in the form of a &quot;kot&quot;, a term having Belgian Dutch origin. A &quot;kot&quot; can be translated as den or hut. The French way to form the plural of &quot;kot&quot; is &quot;kots&quot; (in Dutch, the plural of &quot;kot&quot; is &quot;koten&quot;). In the bilingual region of Brussels, where there are both Dutch- and French-speaking universities and their students, it is common that &quot;for rent&quot; signs are in French only, with the French plural of &quot;kot&quot;.

===Kot-à-projet===
Unique to UCLouvain a Kot-à-projet (kap) is a kot whose inhabitants have similar interests and who organise activities for the general student population, they are similar to Fraternity and sorority houses, but smaller in size with only the committee living in the kot. Being small several Kots can be situated in the same, university owned, apartment building. One of them is &quot;le kap contes&quot;, a kot promoting the art of storytelling. Another is called &quot;Kap Délices&quot; which suggests varied activities such as theme buffets, cooking lessons, and material renting.

===Student Union===
The AGL (General Assembly of Louvain students) is the UCLouvain&#x27;s Students&#x27; union. The body comprises an executive Committee, and a legislative Council. The Committee consists of ex-officio members: President, Vice-Presidents for Education &amp; Welfare, VP for the Medicine faculty (situated in UCLouvain Brussels Woluwe), General Secretary, Activities Officer, Communications Officer, Operations Officer, Foreign student&#x27;s Officer, Cultural Officer, Editor-in-Chief &amp; Deputy Editor-in-Chief as well as the president of the council.

===Publications===
&quot;Quinzaine&quot; a university produced newsletter, &quot;La Savate&quot; produced by the AGL and the monthly &quot;l&#x27;étincelle&quot; by the Kot-à-projet KAP Etincelle. Cercles also produce publications.

===24h Vélo===

The 24 Hour Cycle (24h Vélo) is, nominally, a bicycle endurance road race held in October, organised by &quot;CSE Animations&quot; (Centre Sportif Etudiant). While there is an elite race with teams of two, Student groups enter novelty themed multi-bike vehicles, in the shape of a Van or Whale for example, for prizes. The quality of these designs range in terms of artistic merit, and ability to stay intact over the duration of the race. A 240-minute race also takes place for teenagers. The event is probably best known for what happens off the track. Concurrent with the race is Belgium&#x27;s largest student event, with concerts and stands lasting the full 24hrs.

==Notes==
:A. The Old University of Leuven (1425) is the oldest university in the low countries, and the Catholic University of Leuven (1834) is sometimes, controversially, identified as a continuation of it. Belgium&#x27;s highest court, the Court of Cassation has ruled that the (1834) Catholic University of Leuven cannot be regarded as continuing the old (1425) University of Leuven. See Old University of Leuven#History.
:B. This is a relatively recent phenomenon. In 1859 the university celebrated its 25th anniversary and issued a book celebrating the 25 anniversary of the founding of the Catholic University of Louvain, November 3, 1859. In 1884, the university celebrated its 50th anniversary, acknowledging its actual date of foundation. Only in 1968 did the new Catholic university add the date 1425 to its neo-gothic seal (created in 1909).

<doc id="398480" wikidata="Q909009" url="?curid=398480" title="Doom engine">
<text>id Tech 1, also known as the &quot;Doom&quot; engine, is the game engine used in the id Software video games &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;. It is also used in &quot;Heretic&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Strife: Quest for the Sigil&quot;, &quot;Hacx: Twitch &#x27;n Kill&quot;, &quot;Freedoom&quot;, and other games produced by licensees. It was created by John Carmack, with auxiliary functions written by Mike Abrash, John Romero, Dave Taylor, and Paul Radek. Originally developed on NeXT computers, it was ported to MS-DOS and compatible operating systems for &quot;Doom&quot;&#x27;s initial release and was later ported to several game consoles and operating systems.

The source code to the Linux version of &quot;Doom&quot; was released to the public under a license that granted rights to non-commercial use on December 23, 1997, followed by the Linux version of &quot;Doom II&quot; about a week later on December 29, 1997. The source code was later re-released under the GNU General Public License v2.0 or later on October 3, 1999.
The dozens of unofficial &quot;Doom&quot; source ports that have been created since then allow &quot;Doom&quot; to run on previously unsupported operating systems and sometimes radically expand the engine&#x27;s functionality with new features.

Although the engine renders a 3D space, that space is projected from a two-dimensional floor plan. The line of sight is always parallel to the floor, walls must be perpendicular to the floors, and it is not possible to create multi-level structures or sloped areas (floors and ceilings with different angles). Despite these limitations, the engine represented a technological leap from id&#x27;s previous &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine. The &quot;Doom&quot; engine was later renamed to &quot;id Tech 1&quot; in order to categorize it in a list of id Software&#x27;s long line of game engines.

==Game world==
The &quot;Doom&quot; engine separates rendering from the rest of the game. The graphics engine runs as fast as possible, but the game world runs at 35 frames per second regardless of the hardware, so multiple players can play against each other using computers of varying performance.

==Level structure==

A simple setup demonstrating how &quot;Doom&quot; represents levels internally


Viewed from the top down, all &quot;Doom&quot; levels are actually two-dimensional, demonstrating one of the key limitations of the &quot;Doom&quot; engine: room-over-room is not possible. This limitation, however, has a silver lining: a &quot;map mode&quot; can be easily displayed, which represents the walls and the player&#x27;s position, much like the first image to the right.

===Basic objects===
The base unit is the vertex, which represents a single 2D point. Vertices (or &quot;vertexes&quot; as they are referred to internally) are then joined to form lines, known as &quot;linedefs&quot;. Each linedef can have either one or two sides, which are known as &quot;sidedefs&quot;. Sidedefs are then grouped together to form polygons; these are called &quot;sectors&quot;. Sectors represent particular areas of the level.

===Sectors===
Each sector contains a number of properties: a floor height, ceiling height, light level, a floor texture and a ceiling texture. To have a different light level in a particular area, for example, a new sector must be created for that area with a different light level. One-sided linedefs therefore represent solid walls, while two-sided linedefs represent bridge lines between sectors.

===Sidedefs===
Sidedefs are used to store wall textures; these are completely separate from the floor and ceiling textures. Each sidedef can have three textures; these are called the middle, upper and lower textures. In one-sided linedefs, only the middle texture is used for the texture on the wall. In two-sided linedefs, the situation is more complex. The lower and upper textures are used to fill the gaps where adjacent sectors have different floor and ceiling heights: lower textures are used for steps, for example. The sidedefs can have a middle texture as well, although most do not; this is used to make textures hang in mid air. For example, when a transparent bar texture is seen forming a cage, this is an example of a middle texture on a two-sided linedef.

==Binary space partitioning==
&quot;Doom&quot; makes use of a system known as binary space partitioning (BSP). A tool is used to generate the BSP data for a level beforehand. This process can take quite some time for a large level. It is because of this that it is not possible to move the walls in &quot;Doom&quot;; while doors and lifts move up and down, none of them ever move sideways.

The level is divided up into a binary tree: each location in the tree is a &quot;node&quot; which represents a particular area of the level (with the root node representing the entire level). At each branch of the tree there is a dividing line which divides the area of the node into two subnodes. At the same time, the dividing line divides linedefs into line segments called &quot;segs&quot;.

At the leaves of the tree are convex polygons, where further division of the level is not needed. These convex polygons are referred to as subsectors (or &quot;SSECTORS&quot;), and are bound to a particular sector. Each subsector has a list of segs associated with it.

The BSP system sorts the subsectors into the right order for rendering. The algorithm is fairly simple:

#Start at the root node.
#Draw the child nodes of this node recursively. The child node closest to the camera is drawn first using a Scanline algorithm. This can be found from looking at which side of the node&#x27;s dividing line the camera is on.
#When a subsector is reached, draw it.

The process is complete when the whole column of pixels is filled (i.e., there are no more gaps left). This ordering ensures that no time is used drawing objects that are not visible and as a result maps can become very large without any speed penalty.

==Rendering==

===Drawing the walls===
All of the walls in &quot;Doom&quot; are drawn vertically; it is because of this that it is not possible to properly look up and down. It is possible to perform a form of look up/down via &quot;y-shearing&quot;, and many modern &quot;Doom&quot; source ports do this, as well as later games that use the engine, such as &quot;Heretic&quot;. Essentially this works by moving the horizon line up and down within the screen, in effect providing a &quot;window&quot; on a taller viewable area. By moving the window up and down, it is possible to give the illusion of looking up and down. However, this will distort the view the further up and down the player looks.

The &quot;Doom&quot; engine renders the walls as it traverses the BSP tree, drawing subsectors by order of distance from the camera so that the closest segs are drawn first. As the segs are drawn, they are stored in a linked list. This is used to clip other segs rendered later on, reducing overdraw. This is also used later to clip the edges of sprites.

Once the engine reaches a solid (1-sided) wall at a particular x coordinate, no more lines need to be drawn at that area. For clipping the engine stores a &quot;map&quot; of areas of the screen where solid walls have been reached. This allows far away parts of the level which are invisible to the player to be clipped completely.

The &quot;Doom&quot; graphic format stores the wall textures as sets of vertical columns; this is useful to the renderer, which essentially renders the walls by drawing many vertical columns of textures.

===Floor and ceiling===
The system for drawing floors and ceilings (&quot;flats&quot;) is less elegant than that used for the walls. Flats are drawn with a flood fill-like algorithm. Because of this, if a bad BSP builder is used, it is sometimes possible to get &quot;holes&quot; where the floor or ceiling bleeds down to the edges of the screen, a visual error commonly referred to as a &quot;slime trail&quot;. This is also the reason why if the player travels outside of the level using the noclip cheat the floors and ceilings will appear to stretch out from the level over the empty space.

The floor and ceiling are drawn as &quot;visplanes&quot;. These represent horizontal runs of texture, from a floor or ceiling at a particular height, light level and texture (if two adjacent sectors have exactly the same floor, these can get merged into one visplane). Each x position in the visplane has a particular vertical line of texture which is to be drawn.

Because of this limit of drawing one vertical line at each x position, it is sometimes necessary to split visplanes into multiple visplanes. For example, consider viewing a floor with two concentric squares. The inner square will vertically divide the surrounding floor. In that horizontal range where the inner square is drawn, two visplanes are needed for the surrounding floor.

&quot;Doom&quot; contained a static limit on the number of visplanes; if exceeded, a &quot;visplane overflow&quot; would occur, causing the game to exit to DOS with one of two errors, &quot;No more visplanes!&quot; or &quot;visplane overflow (128 or higher)&quot;. The easiest way to invoke the visplane limit is a large checkerboard floor pattern; this creates a large number of visplanes.

As the segs are rendered, visplanes are also added, extending from the edges of the segs towards the vertical edges of the screen. These extend until they reach existing visplanes. Because of the way this works, the system is dependent on the fact that segs are rendered in order by the overall engine; it is necessary to draw nearer visplanes first, so that they can &quot;cut off&quot; by others further away. If unstopped, the floor or ceiling will &quot;bleed out&quot; to the edges of the screen, as previously described. Eventually, the visplanes form a &quot;map&quot; of particular areas of the screen in which to draw particular textures.

While visplanes are constructed essentially from vertical &quot;strips&quot;, the actual low level rendering is performed in the form of horizontal &quot;spans&quot; of texture. After all the visplanes have been constructed, they are converted into spans which are then rendered to the screen. This appears to be a trade off: it is easier to construct visplanes as vertical strips, but because of the nature of how the floor and ceiling textures appear it is easier to draw them as horizontal strips.

===Things (sprites)===
Each sector within the level has a linked list of things stored in that sector. As each sector is drawn the sprites are placed into a list of sprites to be drawn. If not within the field of view these are ignored.

The edges of sprites are clipped by checking the list of segs previously drawn. Sprites in &quot;Doom&quot; are stored in the same column based format as the walls are, which again is useful for the renderer. The same functions which are used to draw walls are used to draw sprites as well.

While subsectors are guaranteed to be in order, the sprites within them are not. &quot;Doom&quot; stores a list of sprites to be drawn (&quot;vissprites&quot;) and sorts the list before rendering. Far away sprites are drawn before close ones. This causes some overdraw but usually this is negligible.

There is a final issue of middle textures on 2-sided lines, used in transparent bars for example. These are mixed in and drawn with the sprites at the end of the rendering process, rather than with the other walls.

== Games using the &quot;Doom&quot; engine ==

The &quot;Doom&quot; engine achieved most of its fame as a result of powering the classic first person shooter &quot;Doom&quot;, and it was used in several other games. It is usually considered that the &quot;Big Four&quot; &quot;Doom&quot; engine games are &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Heretic&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Strife: Quest for the Sigil&quot;.

=== Games built directly on the &quot;Doom&quot; engine ===
=== Games based on the &quot;Doom&quot; or &quot;Doom II&quot; code ===
In the 1990s a handful of developers acquired licenses to distribute total conversions of &quot;Doom&quot;, and following the 1997 source code release a number of standalone titles have been produced in the engine, including freeware, fangames and commercial titles.

<doc id="398485" wikidata="Q3586928" url="?curid=398485" title="List of Alberta general elections">
<text>The Canadian province of Alberta holds elections to its unicameral legislative body, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The maximum period between general elections of the assembly is five years, but the Lieutenant Governor is able to call one at any time. However, the premier has typically asked the lieutenant governor to call the election in the fourth or fifth year after the preceding election. The number of seats has increased over time, from 25 for the first election in 1905, to the current 87.

Alberta&#x27;s politics has historically been one of long-lasting governments with government changes being few and far between. The province from 1905 to 2015 was ruled by four &quot;dynasties&quot;: the Liberal Party (1905–1921); the United Farmers of Alberta (1921–1935), the Social Credit Party (1935–1971), and the Progressive Conservative (PC) Association (1971–2015), the longest political dynasty in Canada. No minority government has ever been elected. Thus, Alberta can be said to have continuously had a dominant-party system for its entire political history, though the dominant party has changed over time.

In 2015, the NDP were elected to government for the first time in Alberta&#x27;s history. The NDP had Alberta&#x27;s only one term government thus far.

In 2019 the newly formed United Conservative Party formed the government.

From 1905 to 1956, Alberta elections used a combination of single-member and multi-member districts. 
From 1905 to 1924, each voter cast as many votes as seats to be filled in the district.
From 1924 to the present, each voter has been able to cast just one vote.

From 1905 to 1924, plurality was enough to be elected.

From 1924 to 1956, each voter cast a ranked ballot, in a hybrid system of Single Transferable Voting in multi-member districts in the cities and Instant-runoff voting in single-member districts outside the cities, producing proportional representation in the cities and majority-winner results elsewhere. Only Alberta and Manitoba have used a proportional representation system for any length of time in the history of Canada, although in both provinces it was applied only partially.

Since 1956, Alberta&#x27;s elections have used single-member plurality, also known as First-past-the-post voting.

== Summary ==
The table below shows the total number of seats won by each political party in each election. Full details on any election are linked via the year of the election at the start of the row, and details for the legislature that followed the election are available at the legislature number.
Note that election results show differences at 1926 and 1959, when different electoral systems were adopted, as described in the &quot;Electoral system&quot; section.

=== Notes ===
: Known as the Conservative Party prior to 1959.
: Known as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) prior to 1963.
: In 1913, 55 people occupied 56 seats. C.W. Cross was elected in two different districts.

==Electoral system==
Alberta has used a variety of electoral systems in its history, notably a combination of single transferable vote (STV) and instant-runoff voting (IRV) for nearly four decades.

=== Electoral systems of Alberta ===
Alberta&#x27;s first election was fought in 25 single-member first past the post districts. The Liberal government, like other Canadian jurisdictions at the time, introduced two-member constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in 1909 to accommodate their population. Voting in these multi-member districts was by Block Voting.

Each was broken up into three single-member districts by 1917, as the overall number of districts increased rapidly. As well 1917 saw two other innovations - election of two MLAs by soldiers and nurses overseas; and automatic re-election of 11 MLAs who were serving in the armed forces.

The Liberal government introduced five-member Block Voting constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in 1921, and made the Medicine Hat into a two-member district. Each voter in the cities was given five votes, in Medicine Hat two votes. The Liberal party led the vote in Edmonton (although not taking a majority of the city vote) and its candidates received multiple votes from the same voters, together taking more votes than the number of Edmontonians who voted. It won all five of Edmonton&#x27;s seats. Because each voter cast multiple votes in the cities where UFA ran only one candidate, the Liberal party vote tally is inflated (with many of its supporters casting multiple votes for party candidates) while each UFA vote truly represents an individual voter. Although it did not win any seats in the cities, the United Farmers won most of the rural seats. Overall it won a majority of the seats in the Legislature and formed government.

The UFA government, which had campaigned on a promise of electoral reform, retained the existing multi-seat districts and adopted Single Transferable Voting in Edmonton, Calgary and Medicine Hat. Instant-runoff voting (IRV) (AKA Alternative Voting) was put into use elsewhere. STV in Edmonton and Calgary produced mixed roughly proportional results in the election of city MLAs.

IRV elsewhere had little impact as the UFA candidates were extremely popular, usually taking a majority of the vote on the First Count. This would be the pattern for the next two decades with the governing party (UFA then Social Credit) taking a majority of the rural seats, and STV in the cities giving each party its proportion of the city seats. These parallel systems, STV in the cities and IRV in the rest of the province, were used for eight elections over three decades.

During these eight elections the only modifications made were that Albertans serving in armed forces in 1944 elected three armed force representatives, one for each branch - army, navy and air force; Medicine Hat was changed to a single-member district prior to the 1930 election; and the number of MLAs sitting for Edmonton and Calgary changed over time.

Until recently, the pattern has been for one party to take a majority of the seats outside the cities, usually by a majority of the vote outright. Due to the relative small number of seats in the cities, that ensured the party&#x27;s ascendancy to power. The UFA did not, but the SC and Conservative governments usually took several city seats as well as most of the rural seats.

This pattern was modulated in the 1950s. Due to change to First past the post in the cities, the one-party ascendency was raised to higher level.

In 1955, the SC government was re-elected with a great majority of the seats but for the first time IRV changed the outcome in four districts. In these districts a SC candidate led in the first count but did not take a majority of the vote and each lost out when votes were transferred as per IRV.

Following this turn of events, Ernest Manning&#x27;s Social Credit government abolished the mixed STV/IRV system, without public consultations or a referendum. The city-wide districts in Edmonton and Calgary were broken up and single-member districts were created, and the use of transferable votes was ended. The government reintroduced first past the post across the province, not seen across the board since 1905. The SC government reaped a windfall of seats in the 1959 election under the new voting system, winning every seat in Edmonton and all but one in Calgary. This result was far in excess of its share of the city vote.

First past the post remains the system used in Alberta and throughout Canada for provincial and federal elections.

<doc id="398489" wikidata="Q2352121" url="?curid=398489" title="Sectarianism">
<text>Sectarianism is a debated concept. Some scholars and journalists define it as pre-existing fixed communal categories in society, and use it to explain political, cultural, or religious conflicts between groups. Others conceive of sectarianism as a set of social practices where daily life is organized on the basis of communal norms and rules that individuals strategically use and transcend. This definition highlights the co-constitutive aspect of sectarianism and people&#x27;s agency, as opposed to understanding sectarianism as being fixed and incompatible communal boundaries.

While sectarianism is often labelled as religious or political, the reality of a sectarian situation is usually much more complex. In its most basic form, sectarianism has been defined as, &#x27;the existence, within a locality, of two or more divided and actively competing communal identities, resulting in a strong sense of dualism which unremittingly transcends commonality, and is both culturally and physically manifest.&#x27;

== Definition ==
The term &quot;sectarianism&quot; is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as &quot;excessive attachment to a particular sect or party, especially in religion&quot;. The phrase &quot;sectarian conflict&quot; usually refers to violent conflict along religious or political lines, such as the conflicts between Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland (religious and class-divisions may play major roles as well). It may also refer to general philosophical, political disparity between different schools of thought, such as that between Shia and Sunni Muslims. Non-sectarians see free association and tolerance of different beliefs as the cornerstones to successful, peaceful human interaction. They adopt political and religious pluralism.

=== Polemics against the term &quot;sectarianism&quot; ===
Some scholars identify the problems with using the term &quot;sectarianism&quot; in articles. Western mainstream media and politicians often presume &quot;sectarianism&quot; as ancient and long-lasting. For example, Obama in his final State of the Union address phrased the sectarian violence in the Middle East as &quot;rooted in conflicts that dated back millennia&quot;, but many pointed out that some sectarian tensions don&#x27;t even date back a decade. &quot;Sectarianism&quot; is also too ambiguous, which makes it a slogan whose meanings are up to the observers. Scholars argued that the use of term &quot;sectarianism&quot; has become a catch-all explanation to conflicts, which drives analytical attention away from underlying political and socioeconomic issues, lacks coherence, and is often associated with emotional negativity. Many scholars find the term &quot;sectarianism&quot; problematic, and therefore three alternatives are proposed.

==== Alternative: Sectarianization ====
Hashemi and Postel and other scholars differentiate between &quot;sectarianism&quot; and &quot;sectarianization&quot;. While &quot;sectarianism&quot; describes antipathy, prejudice, and discrimination between subdivisions within a group, e.g. based on their religious or ethnic identity, the latter describes a process mobilized by political actors operating within authoritarian contexts to pursue their political goals that involve popular mobilization around religious or identity markers. The use of the word &quot;sectarianism&quot; to explain sectarian violence and its upsurge in i.e. the Middle East is insufficient, as it does not take into account complex political realities. In the past and present, religious identities have been politicized and mobilized by state actors inside and outside of the Middle East in pursuit of political gain and power. The term &quot;sectarianization&quot; conceptualizes this notion. Sectarianization is an active, multi-layered process and a set of practices, not a static condition, that is set in motion and shaped by political actors pursuing political goals. The sectarianization thesis focuses on the intersection of politics and sectarian identity from a top-down state-centric perspective. Sectarianization would be more precise if you&#x27;re referring to how sectarian identities and divisions are systematically created or reinforced by the state or other institutions, while sectarianism would be more appropriate when discussing the ideology or attitude that underpins sectarian divisions. While religious identity is salient in the Middle East and has contributed to and intensified conflicts across the region, it is the politicization and mobilization of popular sentiments around certain identity markers (&quot;sectarianization&quot;) that explains the extent and upsurge of sectarian violence in the Middle East. The Ottoman Tanzimat, European colonialism and authoritarianism are key in the process of sectarianization in the Middle East.

==== Alternative: Sectarian as a prefix ====
Haddad argues &quot;sectarianism&quot; cannot capture sectarian relations in reality nor represent the complex expressions of sectarian identities. Haddad calls for an abandonment of -&quot;ism&quot; in &quot;sectarianism&quot; in scholarly research as it &quot;has overshadowed the root&quot; and direct use of &#x27;sectarian&#x27; as a qualifier to &quot;direct our analytical focus towards understanding sectarian &quot;identity&quot;&quot;. Sectarian identity is &quot;simultaneously formulated along four overlapping, interconnected and mutually informing dimensions: doctrinal, subnational, national, and transnational&quot;. The relevance of these factors is context-dependent and works on four layers in chorus. The multi-layered work provides more clarity and enables more accurate diagnoses of problems at certain dimensions to find more specific solutions.

==== Alternative: Sextarianism ====
In her book Sextarianism, Mikdashi emphasizes the relationship between sect, sex and sexuality. She argues that sectarianism cannot be studied in isolation, because the practice of sectarianism always goes hand in hand with the practice of sexism. Moreover, she states that the category &#x27;sect&#x27; is already a patriarchal inheritance. For this reason she proposes the term &quot;sextarianism&quot;. Sex, sexuality and sect together define citizenship, and, since the concept of citizenship is the basis of the modern nation-state, sextarianism therefore forms the basis for the legal bureaucratic systems of the state and thus for state power. It emphasizes how state power articulates, disarticulates, and manages sexual difference bureaucratically, ideologically, and legally. 

Based on Carole Pateman, sexual difference is political difference, while sexual difference is not merely a biological or cultural distinction but a fundamental mechanism of power relations. She argues that sexual difference functions as a process through which sectarian, gendered, and sexual positions are structurally produced, represented, imagined, desired, and managed. In this view, the construction of sexual difference is inseparable from political structures, shaping not only individual identities but also the broader organization of social and political life.

&quot;Sextarianism&quot; builds on Joan Scott’s theorization of the constitutive nature of sexual difference to the history of secularism. According to Mikdashi, sectarianism provided her with the chance to examine the Lebanese state without separating or favoring sectarian differences from sexual differences. This approach is rooted in the ways the state regulates and creates both sexual and sectarian distinctions. The Lebanese legal system shapes sexual difference across various areas of law, with sexual difference playing a far more significant role as a legal category than sectarian difference. The Lebanese state handles both sexual and sectarian differences through its judicial and governmental/bureaucratic structures. Mikdashi furthermore ties this development to the concepts of the evangelical and state based secularism which by emphasising the sectarian sphere through its sovereignty, securitisation, and citizenship laws, manages to enshrine its view into society 

Mikdashi also refers to the idea that sextarianism unpacks how heterosexuality, the sex binary, and civil and criminal law are key to secularism’s management of sexual and religious difference, with secularism’s investment in sex manifesting as the regulation of straight and queer sexualities and a sex-gender binary system.

==== Alternative: Practicing Sectarianism ====

In their book &quot;Practicing Sectarianism&quot; Deep, Nalbantian and Sbaiti (2022) emphasise that sectarianism does not need to remain a historical/anthropological pre-requisite for analyses but benefits from an understanding of the micro-level experiences of individuals, and how they relate, react, and contradict a static framing of &quot;political&quot; sectarianism. They also highlight that the concept - at least when focussing on the prominent example of Lebanon - should be understood as multi-dimensional with (1) political sectarianism, (2) Civil Sectarianism, and (3) Socio-Economic Sectarianism 

== Intersectionality in Sectarianism ==
The analytical framework of intersectionality in examining sectarianism has gained increasing prominence in the study of this subject. Intersectionality highlights the nature of religious, ethnic, political, and social identities in contexts marked by sectarian tensions and conflicts. Acknowledging that individuals&#x27; experiences of sectarianism are shaped not only by their religious affiliation or other sectarian categories but also by other dimensions such as sex, class, and nationality among others, are essentially contributing to those experiences.

=== Religious Dimension ===
Intersectionality reveals that factors like sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status intersect with religious identity to shape individuals&#x27; experiences of sectarianism. Authors such as Maya Mikdashi introduced the concept of &#x27;Sextarianism&#x27;, particularly showing how the role of gender is crucially influencing the individual&#x27;s experience of religious sectarian differences in political sectarian systems such as in Lebanon. In the case of Sectarianism in Lebanon, she highlights how Sextarian differences are decisive vectors in determining woman&#x27;s experiences of power and sovereignty in a political sectarian system.

=== Political Dimension ===
In the political dimensions, the intersectional lens recognizes the intricate connections between political identities and other social categories. Political parties or other factions may exploit religious divisions for political gain, exacerbating sectarian tensions. Intersectionality helps to understand how for instance political affiliations intersect with factors such as socioeconomic status and regional background, providing insights into the motivation behind political mobilization and the dynamics of power in sectarian settings.

=== Implications for Communities ===
The intersectionality of sectarianism has profound implications for affected communities, particularly for individuals who belong to multiple marginalized groups such as women, migrants, and marginalized ethnicities living under sectarian systems. The recognition of these intersecting forms of discrimination and marginalization is decisive for developing inclusive strategies to promote peace, tolerance, and increased social cohesion within diverse societies.

==Political sectarianism==
===Sectarianism in the 21st century===
Sectarian tendencies in politics are visible in countries and cities associated with sectarian violence in the present, and the past. Notable examples where sectarianism affects lives are street-art expression, urban planning, and sports club affiliation.

====United Kingdom====
Across the United Kingdom, Scottish and Irish sectarian tendencies are often reflected in team-sports competitions. Affiliations are regarded as a latent representation of sectarianism tendencies. (Since the early 1900s, cricket teams were established via patronage of sectarian affiliated landlords. In response to the Protestant representation of the sport, many Catholic schools founded their own Cricket schools.) Modern day examples include tensions in sports such as football and have led to the passing of the &quot;Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012&quot;.

===Authoritarian regimes===
In recent years, authoritarian regimes have been particularly prone to sectarianization. This is because their key strategy of survival lies in manipulating sectarian identities to deflect demands for change and justice, and preserve and perpetuate their power. The sectarianization as a theory and process that extended beyond the Middle East was introduced by Saleena Saleem (see and ). Christian communities, and other religious and ethnic minorities in the Middle East, have been socially, economically and politically excluded and harmed primarily by regimes that focus on &quot;securing power and manipulating their base by appeals to Arab nationalism and/or to Islam&quot;. An example of this is the Middle Eastern regional response to the Iranian revolution of 1979. Middle Eastern dictatorships backed by the United States, especially Saudi Arabia, feared that the spread of the revolutionary spirit and ideology would affect their power and dominance in the region. Therefore, efforts were made to undermine the Iranian revolution by labeling it as a Shi’a conspiracy to corrupt the Sunni Islamic tradition. This was followed by a rise of anti-Shi’a sentiments across the region and a deterioration of Shi&#x27;a-Sunni relations, impelled by funds from the Gulf states. Therefore, the process of sectarianization, the mobilization and politicization of sectarian identities, is a political tool for authoritarian regimes to perpetuate their power and justify violence. Western powers indirectly take part in the process of sectarianization by supporting undemocratic regimes in the Middle East. As Nader Hashemi asserts:The U.S. invasion of Iraq; the support of various Western governments for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commits war crime upon war crime in Yemen and disseminates poisonous sectarian propaganda throughout the Sunni world; not to mention longstanding Western support for highly repressive dictators who manipulate sectarian fears and anxieties as a strategy of control and regime survival – the &quot;ancient hatreds&quot; narrative [between Sunnis and Shi’as] washes this all away and lays the blame for the regionʹs problems on supposedly trans-historical religious passions. Itʹs absurd in the extreme and an exercise in bad faith.

==== Approaches to Study Sectarian Identities in authoritarian regimes ====
Scholars have adopted three approaches to study sectarian discourses: primordialism, instrumentalism, and constructivism. Primordialism sees sectarian identity as rotted in biology and ingrained in history and culture. Makdisi describes the process of bringing the sectarian discourses back to early Islamic history as &quot;pervasive medievalization&quot;. The centuries-old narrative is problematic as it treats sectarian identities in the Middle East as &quot;sui generis&quot; instead of modern collective identities. Scholars should be cautious of sectarian essentialism and Middle East exceptionalism the primordial narrative reinforces since primordialism suggests sectarian tensions persist while theological differences do not guarantee conflicts. Instrumentalism emphasizes that ruling elites manipulate identities to create violent conflicts for their interests. Instrumentalists see the Sunni-Shi&#x27;a divide as a modern invention and challenge the myths of primordial narratives since sectarian harmony have existed for centuries. Constructivism is in the middle ground of primordialism and instrumentalism.

==Religious sectarianism==

Wherever people of different religions live in close proximity to each other, religious sectarianism can often be found in varying forms and degrees. In some areas, religious sectarians (for example Protestant and Catholic Christians) exist peacefully side by side for the most part, although these differences have resulted in violence, death, and outright warfare as recently as the 1990s. Probably the best-known example in recent times were The Troubles.

Catholic-Protestant sectarianism has also been a factor in U.S. presidential campaigns. Prior to John F. Kennedy, only one Catholic (Al Smith) had ever been a major party presidential nominee, and he had been solidly defeated largely because of claims based on his Catholicism. JFK chose to tackle the sectarian issue head-on during the West Virginia primary, but that only sufficed to win him barely enough Protestant votes to eventually win the presidency by one of the narrowest margins ever.

Within Islam, there has been dilemmas at various periods between Sunnis and Shias; Shias consider Sunnis to be false, due to their refusal to accept the first caliph as Ali and accept all following descendants of him as infallible and divinely guided. Many Sunni religious leaders, including those inspired by Wahhabism and other ideologies have declared Shias to be heretics or apostates.

===Europe===

In some countries where the Reformation was successful, there was persecution of Roman Catholics. This was motivated by the perception that Catholics retained allegiance to a &#x27;foreign&#x27; power (the papacy or the Vatican), causing them to be regarded with suspicion. Sometimes this mistrust manifested itself in Catholics being subjected to restrictions and discrimination, which itself led to further conflict. For example, before Catholic Emancipation was introduced with the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, Catholics were forbidden from voting, becoming MP&#x27;s or buying land in Ireland. 

====Ireland====
Protestant-Catholic sectarianism is prominent in Irish history; during the period of English (and later British) rule, Protestant settlers from Britain were &quot;planted&quot; in Ireland, which along with the Protestant Reformation led to increasing sectarian tensions between Irish Catholics and British Protestants. These tensions eventually boiled over into widespread violence during the Irish Rebellion of 1641. At the end of that war the lands of Catholics were confiscated with over ten million acres granted to new English owners under the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–1653) saw a series of massacres perpetrated by the Protestant New Model Army against Catholic English royalists and Irish civilians. Sectarianism between Catholics and Protestants continued in the Kingdom of Ireland, with the Irish Rebellion of 1798 against British rule leading to more sectarian violence in the island, most infamously the Scullabogue Barn massacre, in which Protestants were burned alive in County Wexford. The British response to the rebellion which included the public executions of dozens of suspected rebels in Dunlavin and Carnew, also inflamed sectarian sentiments.

====Northern Ireland====
After the Partition of Ireland in 1922, Northern Ireland witnessed decades of intensified conflict, tension, and sporadic violence (see The Troubles (1920–1922) and 
The Troubles) between the dominant Protestant majority and the Catholic minority. In 1969 the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was formed to support civil rights and end discrimination (based on religion) in voting rights (see Gerrymandering), housing allocation and employment. Also in 1969, 25 years of violence erupted, becoming what is known as “The Troubles” between Irish Republicans whose goal is a United Ireland and Ulster loyalists who wish for Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom. The conflict was primarily fought over the existence of the Northern Irish state rather than religion, though sectarian relations within Northern Ireland fueled the conflict. However, religion is commonly used as a marker to differentiate the two sides of the community. The Catholic minority primarily favour the nationalist, and to some degree, republican, goal of unity with the Republic of Ireland, while the Protestant majority favour Northern Ireland continuing the union with Great Britain.

====England====
In June 1780 a series of riots (see the Gordon Riots) occurred in London motivated by anti-Catholic sentiment. These riots were described as being the most destructive in the history of London and resulted in approximately 300-700 deaths. A long history of politically and religious motivated sectarian violence already existed in Ireland (see Irish Rebellions). The sectarian divisions related to the &quot;Irish question&quot; influenced local constituent politics in England.

Liverpool is an English city sometimes associated with sectarian politics. Halfway through the 19th century, Liverpool faced a wave of mass-immigration from Irish Catholics as a consequence of the Great Famine in Ireland. Most of the Irish-Catholic immigrants were unskilled workers and aligned themselves with the Labour party. The Labour-Catholic party saw a larger political electorate in the many Liverpool-Irish, and often ran on the slogan of &quot;Home Rule&quot; - the independence of Ireland, to gain the support of Irish voters. During the first half of the 20th century, Liverpool politics were divided not only between Catholics and Protestants, but between two polarized groups consisting of multiple identities: Catholic-Liberal-Labour and Protestant-Conservative-Tory/Orangeists.

From early 1900 onwards, the polarized Catholic Labour and Protestant Conservative affiliations gradually broke apart and created the opportunity for mixed alliances. The Irish National party gained its first electoral victory in 1875, and kept growing until the realization of Irish independence in 1921, after which it became less reliant on Labour support. On the Protestant side, Tory opposition in 1902 to vote in line with Protestant proposed bills indicated a split between the working class Protestants and the Tory party, which were regarded as &quot;too distant&quot; from its electorate.

After the First and Second World War, religiously mixed battalions provided a counterweight to anti-Roman Catholic and anti-Protestant propaganda from either side. While the IRA-bombing in 1939 (see S-Plan) somewhat increased violence between the Irish-Catholic associated Labour party and the Conservative Protestants, the German May Blitz destroyed property of more than 40.000 households. Rebuilding Liverpool after the war created a new sense of community across religious lines. Inter-church relations increased as a response as well, as seen through the warming up of relations between Archbishop Worlock and Anglican Bishop David Sheppard after 1976, a symbol of decreasing religious hostility. The increase in education rates and the rise of trade and labour unions shifted religious affiliation to class affiliation further, which allowed Protestant and catholic affiliates under a Labour umbrella in politics. In the 1980s, class division had outgrown religious division, replacing religious sectarianism with class struggle. Growing rates of non-English immigration from other parts of the Commonwealth near the 21st century also provides new political lines of division in identity affiliation.

Northern Ireland has introduced a Private Day of Reflection, since 2007, to mark the transition to a post-[sectarian] conflict society, an initiative of the cross-community Healing Through Remembering organization and research project.

====The Balkans====
The civil wars in the Balkans which followed the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s have been heavily tinged with sectarianism. Croats and Slovenes have traditionally been Catholic, Serbs and Macedonians Eastern Orthodox, and Bosniaks and most Albanians Muslim. Religious affiliation served as a marker of group identity in this conflict, despite relatively low rates of religious practice and belief among these various groups after decades of communism.

===Africa===
Over 1,000 Muslims and Christians were killed in the sectarian violence in the Central African Republic in 2013–2014. Nearly 1 million people, a quarter of the population, were displaced.

===Australia===

Sectarianism in Australia is a historical legacy from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, between Catholics of mainly Celtic heritage and Protestants of mainly English descent. It has largely disappeared in the 21st century. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, religious tensions were more centered between Muslim immigrants and non-Muslim nationalists, amid the backdrop of the War on Terror. 

===Asia===


====Japan====
For the violent conflict between Buddhist sects in Japan, see Japanese Buddhism.

====Pakistan====

Pakistan, one of the largest Muslim countries the world, has seen serious Shia-Sunni sectarian violence. Almost 85-90% 
of Pakistan&#x27;s Muslim population is Sunni, and another 10-15% are Shia. However, this Shia minority forms the second largest Shia population of any country, larger than the Shia majority in Iraq.

In the last two decades, as many as 4,000 people are estimated to have died in sectarian fighting in Pakistan, 300 in 2006. Among the culprits blamed for the killing are Al Qaeda working &quot;with local sectarian groups&quot; to kill what they perceive as Shi&#x27;a apostates.

====Sri Lanka====

The BBC reported that &quot;Sri Lanka’s Muslim minority is being targeted by hardline Buddhists. ... There have also been assaults on churches and Christian pastors but it is the Muslims who are the most concerned.&quot; Most of the LTTE leaders were captured and gunned down at blank range in May, 2009, after which a genocide of Sri Lankan Tamils in the Northern Province, Sri Lanka has started. Even a book, The Tamil Genocide by Sri Lanka has been written on this genocide. Tamils Against Genocide hired US attorney Bruce Fein to file human rights violation charges against two Sri Lankan officials associated with the civil war in Sri Lanka which has reportedly claimed the lives of thousands of civilians.

=== Turkey ===

==== Ottoman Empire ====
In 1511, a pro-Shia revolt known as Şahkulu Rebellion was brutally suppressed by the Ottomans: 40,000 were massacred on the order of the sultan.

==== Republican era (1923-) ====
Alevis were targeted in various massacres including 1978 Maraş massacre, 1980 Çorum massacre and 1993 Sivas massacre.

During his campaign for the 2023 Turkish presidential election, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was attacked with sectarian insults in Adıyaman.

=== Iran ===

==== Overview ====

Sectarianism in Iran has existed for centuries, dating back to the Islamic conquest of the country in early Islamic years and continuing throughout Iranian history until the present. During the Safavid dynasty&#x27;s reign, sectarianism started to play an important role in shaping the path of the country. During the Safavid rule between 1501 and 1722, Shiism started to evolve and became established as the official state religion, leading to the creation of the first religiously legitimate government since the occultation of the Twelfth imam. This pattern of sectarianism prevailed throughout the Iranian history. The approach that sectarianism has taken after the Iranian 1979 revolution is shifted compared to the earlier periods. Never before the Iranian 1979 revolution did the Shiite leadership gain as much authority. Due to this change, the sectarian timeline in Iran can be divided in pre- and post-Iranian 1979 revolution where the religious leadership changed course.

==== Pre-1979 Revolution ====

Shiism has been an important factor in shaping the politics, culture and religion within Iran, long before the Iranian 1979 revolution. During the Safavid dynasty Shiism was established as the official ideology. The establishment of Shiism as an official government ideology opened the doors for clergies to benefit from new cultural, political and religious rights which were denied prior to the Safavid ruling. During the Safavid dynasty Shiism was established as the official ideology.
The Safavid rule allowed greater freedom for religious leaders. By establishing Shiism as the state religion, they legitimised the religious authority. After this power establishment, religious leaders started to play a crucial role within the political system but remained socially and economically independent. The monarchial power balance during the Safavid ere changed every few years, resulting in a changing limit of power of the clergies. The tensions concerning power relations of the religious authorities and the ruling power eventually played a pivotal role in the 1906 constitutional revolution which limited the power of the monarch, and increased the power of religious leaders. The 1906 constitutional revolution involved both constitutionalist and anti-constitutionalist clergy leaders. Individuals such as Sayyid Jamal al-Din Va&#x27;iz were constitutionalist clergies whereas other clergies such as Mohammed Kazem Yazdi were considered anti-constitutionalist. The establishment of a Shiite government during the Safavid rule resulted in the increase of power within this religious sect. The religious power establishment increased throughout the years and resulted in fundamental changes within the Iranian society in the twentieth century, eventually leading to the establishment of the Shiite Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979.

==== Post-1979 Revolution: Islamic Republic of Iran ====

The Iranian 1979 revolution led to the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty and the establishment of the Islamic Government of Iran. The governing body of Iran displays clear elements of sectarianism which are visible within different layers of its system.
The 1979 revolution led to changes in political system, leading to the establishment of a bureaucratic clergy-regime which has created its own interpretation of the Shia sect in Iran. Religious differentiation is often used by authoritarian regimes to express hostility towards other groups such as ethnic minorities and political opponents. Authoritarian regimes can use religion as a weapon to create an &quot; &quot;us and them&quot; &quot; paradigm. This leads to hostility amongst the involved parties and takes place internally but also externally. A valid example is the suppression of religious minorities like the Sunnis and Baha-ís. With the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran sectarian discourses arose in the Middle-East as the Iranian religious regime has attempted and in some cases succeeded to spread its religious and political ideas in the region. These sectarian labeled issues are politically charged. The most notable Religious leaders in Iran are named &quot;Supreme-leaders.&quot; Their role has proved to be pivotal in the evolvement of sectarianism within the country and in the region. The following part discusses Iran&#x27;s supreme-leadership in further detail.

==== Ruhollah Khomeini and Ali Khamenei ====

During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran&#x27;s first supreme-leader, Ayatollah Khomeini called for the participation of all Iranians in the war. His usage of Shia martyrdom led to the creation of a national consensus. In the early aftermath of the Iranian 1979 revolution, Khomeini started to evolve a sectarian tone in his speeches. His focus on Shiism and Shia Islam grew which was also implemented within the changing policies of the country. In one of his speeches Khomeini quoted: &quot;the Path to Jerusalem passes through Karbala.&quot; His phrase lead to many different interpretations, leading to turmoil in the region but also within the country. From a religious historic viewpoint, Karbala and Najaf which are both situated in Iraq, serve as important sites for Shia Muslims around the world. By mentioning these two cities, Khomeini led to the creation of Shia expansionism. 
Khomeini&#x27;s war with the Iraqi Bath Regime had many underlying reasons and sectarianism can be considered one of the main reasons. The tensions between Iran and Iraq are of course not only sectarian related, but religion is often a weapon used by the Iranian regime to justify its actions. Khomeini&#x27;s words also resonated in other Arab countries who had been fighting for Palestinian liberation against Israel. By naming Jerusalem, Khomeini expressed his desire for liberating Palestine from the hands of what he later often has named &quot;the enemy of Islam.&quot; Iran has supported rebellious groups throughout the region. Its support for Hamas and Hezbollah has resulted in international condemnation. 
This desire for Shia expansionism did not disappear after Khomeini&#x27;s death. It can even be argued that sectarian tone within the Islamic Republic of Iran has grown since then. 
The Friday prayers held in Tehran by Ali Khamenei can be seen as a proof of growing sectarian tone within the regime. Khamenei&#x27;s speeches are extremely political and sectarian. He often mentions extreme wishes such as the removal of Israel from the world map and fatwas directed towards those opposing the regime.

===Iraq===
Sunni Iraqi insurgency and foreign Sunni terrorist organizations who came to Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein have targeted Shia civilians in sectarian attacks. Following the civil war, the Sunnis have complained of discrimination by Iraq&#x27;s Shia majority governments, which is bolstered by the news that Sunni detainees were allegedly discovered to have been tortured in a compound used by government forces on 15 November 2005. This sectarianism has fueled a giant level of emigration and internal displacement.

The Shia majority oppression by the Sunni minority has a long history in Iraq. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the British government placed a Sunni Hashemite monarchy to the Iraqi throne which suppressed various uprisings against its rule by the Christian Assyrians and Shi&#x27;ites.

===Syria===
Although sectarianism has been described as one of the characteristic features of the Syrian civil war, the narrative of sectarianism already had its origins in Syria&#x27;s past.

==== Ottoman rule ====
The hostilities that took place in 1850 in Aleppo and subsequently in 1860 in Damascus, had many causes and reflected long-standing tensions. However, scholars have claimed that the eruptions of violence can also be partly attributed to the modernizing reforms, the Tanzimat, taking place within the Ottoman Empire, who had been ruling Syria since 1516. The Tanzimat reforms attempted to bring about equality between Muslims and non-Muslims living in the Ottoman Empire. These reforms, combined with European interference on behalf of the Ottoman Christians, caused the non-Muslims to gain privileges and influence.

In the silk trade business, European powers formed ties with local sects. They usually opted for a sect that adhered to a religion similar to the one in their home countries, thus not Muslims. These developments caused new social classes to emerge, consisting of mainly Christians, Druzes and Jews. These social classes stripped the previously existing Muslim classes of their privileges. The involvement of another foreign power, though this time non-European, also had its influence on communal relations in Syria. Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt ruled Syria between 1831 and 1840. His divide-and-rule strategy contributed to the hostilities between the Druze and Maronite community, by arming the Maronite Christians. However, it is noteworthy to mention that different sects did not fight the others out of religious motives, nor did Ibrahim Pasha aim to disrupt society among communal lines. This can also be illustrated by the unification of Druzes and Maronites in their revolts to oust Ibrahim Pasha in 1840. This shows the fluidity of communal alliances and animosities and the different, at times non-religious, reasons that may underline sectarianism.

==== After Ottoman rule ====
Before the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the French Mandate in Syria, the Syrian territory had already witnessed massacres on the Maronite Christians, other Christians, Alawites, Shias and Ismailiyas, which had resulted in distrustful sentiments between the members of different sects. In an attempt to protect the minority communities against the majority Sunni population, France, with the command of Henri Gouraud, created five states for the following sects: Armenians, Alawites, Druzes, Maronite Christians and Sunni Muslims. This focus on minorities was new and part of a divide-and-rule strategy of the French, which enhanced and politicized differences between sects. The restructuring by the French caused the Alawite community to advance itself from their marginalized position. In addition to that, the Alawites were also able to obtain a position of power through granting top level positions to family members of the ruling clan or other tribal allies of the Alawite community.

During the period 1961–1980, Syria was not necessarily exclusively ruled by the Alawite sect, but due to efforts of the Sunni Muslim extremist opponents of the Ba’th regime in Syria, it was perceived as such. The Ba’ath regime was being dominated by the Alawite community, as well as were other institutions of power. As a result of this, the regime was considered to be sectarian, which caused the Alawite community to cluster together, as they feared for their position. This period is actually contradictory as Hafez al-Assad tried to create a Syrian Arab nationalism, but the regime was still regarded as sectarian and sectarian identities were reproduced and politicized.

Sectarian tensions that later gave rise to the Syrian civil war, had already appeared in society due to events preceding 1970. For example, President Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s involvement in the Lebanese civil war by giving political aid to Maronite Christians in Lebanon. This was viewed by many Sunny Muslims as an act of treason, which made them link al-Assad&#x27;s actions to his Alawite identity. The Muslim Brothers, a part of the Sunni Muslims, used those tensions towards the Alawites as a tool to boost their political agenda and plans. Several assassinations were carried out by the Muslim Brothers, mostly against Alawites, but also against some Sunni Muslims. The failed assassination attempt on President Hafez al-Assad is arguably the most well-known. Part of the animosity between the Alawites and the Sunni Islamists of the Muslim Brothers is due to the secularization of Syria, which the later holds the Alawites in power to be responsible for.

==== Syrian Civil War ====
As of 2015, the majority of the Syrian population consisted of Sunni Muslims, namely two-thirds of the population, which can be found throughout the country. The Alawites are the second largest group, which make up around 10 percent of the population. This makes them a ruling minority. The Alawites were originally settled in the highlands of Northwest Syria, but since the twentieth century have spread to places like Latakia, Homs and Damascus. Other groups that can be found in Syria are Christians, among which the Maronite Christians, Druzes and Twelver Shias. Although sectarian identities played a role in the unfolding of events of the Syrian Civil War, the importance of tribal and kinship relationships should not be underestimated, as they can be used to obtain and maintain power and loyalty.

At the start of the protests against President Basher al-Assad in March 2011, there was no sectarian nature or approach involved. The opposition had national, inclusive goals and spoke in the name of a collective Syria, although the protesters being mainly Sunni Muslims. This changed after the protests and the following civil war began to be portrayed in sectarian terms by the regime, as a result of which people started to mobilize along ethnic lines. However, this does not mean that the conflict is solely or primarily a sectarian conflict, as there were also socio-economic factors at play. These socio-economic factors were mainly the result of Basher al-Assad&#x27;s mismanaged economic restructuring. The conflict has therefore been described as being semi-sectarian, making sectarianism a factor at play in the civil war, but certainly does not stand alone in causing the war and has varied in importance throughout time and place.

In addition to local forces, the role of external actors in the conflict in general as well as the sectarian aspect of the conflict should not be overlooked. Although foreign regimes were first in support of the Free Syrian Army, they eventually ended up supporting sectarian militias with money and arms. However, it has to be said that their sectarian nature did not only attract these flows of support, but they also adopted a more sectarian and Islamic appearance in order to attract this support.

===Yemen===
==== Introduction ====
In Yemen, there have been many clashes between Salafis and Shia Houthis. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;In today’s Middle East, activated sectarianism affects the political cost of alliances, making them easier between co-religionists. That helps explain why Sunni-majority states are lining up against Iran, Iraq and Hezbollah over Yemen.&quot;

Historically, divisions in Yemen along religious lines (sects) used to be less intense than those in Pakistan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. However, the situation has changed dramatically after the Houthi takeover in 2014. Most political forces in Yemen are primarily characterized by regional interests and not by religious sectarianism. Regional interests are, for example, the north&#x27;s proximity to the Hejaz, the south&#x27;s coast along the Indian Ocean trade route, and the southeast&#x27;s oil and gas fields. Yemen&#x27;s northern population consists for a substantial part of Zaydis, and its southern population predominantly of Shafi’is. Hadhramaut in Yemen&#x27;s southeast has a distinct Sufi Ba’Alawi profile.

==== Ottoman era, 1849–1918 ====
Sectarianism reached the region once known as Arabia Felix with the 1911 Treaty of Daan. It divided the Yemen Vilayet into an Ottoman controlled section and an Ottoman-Zaydi controlled section. The former dominated by Sunni Islam and the latter by Zaydi-Shia Islam, thus dividing the Yemen Vilayet along Islamic sectarian lines. Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din became the ruler of the Zaidi community within this Ottoman entity. Before the agreement, inter-communal battles between Shafi’is and Zaydis never occurred in the Yemen Vilayet. After the agreement, sectarian strife still did not surface between religious communities. Feuds between Yemenis were nonsectarian in nature, and Zaydis attacked Ottoman officials not because they were Sunnis.

Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the divide between Shafi’is and Zaydis changed with the establishment of the Kingdom of Yemen. Shafi’i scholars were compelled to accept the supreme authority of Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din, and the army “institutionalized the supremacy of the Zaydi tribesman over the Shafi’is”.

==== Unification period, 1918–1990 ====
Before the 1990 Yemeni unification, the region had never been united as one country. In order to create unity and overcome sectarianism, the myth of Qahtanite was used as a nationalist narrative. Although not all ethnic groups of Yemen fit in this narrative, such as the Al-Akhdam and the Teimanim. The latter established a Jewish kingdom in ancient Yemen, the only one ever created outside Palestine. A massacre of Christians, executed by the Jewish king Dhu Nuwas, eventually led to the fall of the Homerite Kingdom. In modern times, the establishment of the Jewish state resulted in the 1947 Aden riots, after which most Teimanim left the country during Operation Magic Carpet.

Conflicting geopolitical interests surfaced during the North Yemen Civil War (1962–1970). Wahhabist Saudi Arabia and other Arab monarchies supported Muhammad al-Badr, the deposed Zaydi imam of the Kingdom of Yemen. His adversary, Abdullah al-Sallal, received support from Egypt and other Arab republics. Both international backings were not based on religious sectarian affiliation. In Yemen however, President Abdullah al-Sallal (a Zaydi) sidelined his vice-president Abdurrahman al-Baidani (a Shaffi&#x27;i) for not being a member of the Zaydi sect. Shaffi&#x27;i officials of North Yemen also lobbied for &quot;the establishment of a separate Shaffi&#x27;i state in Lower Yemen&quot; in this period.

==== Contemporary Sunni-Shia rivalry ====
According to Lisa Wedeen, the perceived sectarian rivalry between Sunnis and Shias in the Muslim world is not the same as Yemen&#x27;s sectarian rivalry between Salafists and Houthis. Not all supporters of Houthi&#x27;s Ansar Allah movement are Shia, and not all Zaydis are Houthis. Although most Houthis are followers of Shia&#x27;s Zaydi branch, most Shias in the world are from the Twelver branch. Yemen is geographically not in proximity of the so-called Shia Crescent. To link Hezbollah and Iran, whose subjects are overwhelmingly Twelver Shias, organically with Houthis is exploited for political purposes. Saudi Arabia emphasized an alleged military support of Iran for the Houthis during Operation Scorched Earth. The slogan of the Houthi movement is &#x27;Death to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews&#x27;. This is a trope of Iran and Hezbollah, so the Houthis seem to have no qualms about a perceived association with them.

==== Tribes and political movements ====
Tribal culture in the southern regions has virtually disappeared through policies of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen. However, Yemen&#x27;s northern part is still home to the powerful tribal confederations of Bakil and Hashid. These tribal confederations maintain their own institutions without state interference, such as prisons, courts, and armed forces. Unlike the Bakils, the Hashids adopted Salafist tenets, and during the Sa’dah War (2004–2015) sectarian tensions materialized. Yemen&#x27;s Salafists attacked the Zaydi Mosque of Razih in Sa’dah and destroyed tombs of Zaydi imams across Yemen. In turn, Houthis attacked Yemen&#x27;s main Salafist center of Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wadi&#x27;I during the Siege of Dammaj. Houthis also attacked the Salafist Bin Salman Mosque and threatened various Teimanim families.

Members of Hashid&#x27;s elite founded the Sunni Islamist party Al-Islah and, as a counterpart, Hizb al-Haqq was founded by Zaydis with the support of Bakil&#x27;s elite. Violent non-state actors Al-Qaeda, Ansar al-Sharia and Daesh, particularly active in southern cities like Mukalla, fuel sectarian tendencies with their animosity towards Yemen&#x27;s Isma&#x27;ilis, Zaydis, and others. An assassination attempt in 1995 on Hosni Mubarak, executed by Yemen&#x27;s Islamists, damaged the country&#x27;s international reputation. The war on terror further strengthened Salafist-jihadist groups impact on Yemen&#x27;s politics. The 2000 USS Cole bombing resulted in US military operations on Yemen&#x27;s soil. Collateral damage caused by cruise missiles, cluster bombs, and drone attacks, deployed by the United States, compromised Yemen&#x27;s sovereignty.

==== Ali Abdullah Saleh&#x27;s reign ====
Ali Abdullah Saleh is a Zaydi from the Hashid&#x27;s Sanhan clan and founder of the nationalist party General People&#x27;s Congress. During his decades long reign as head of state, he used Sa&#x27;dah&#x27;s Salafist&#x27;s ideological dissemination against Zaydi&#x27;s Islamic revival advocacy. In addition, the Armed Forces of Yemen used Salafists as mercenaries to fight against Houthis. Though, Ali Abdullah Saleh also used Houthis as a political counterweight to Yemen&#x27;s Muslim Brotherhood. Due to the Houthis persistent opposition to the central government, Upper Yemen was economically marginalized by the state. This policy of divide and rule executed by Ali Abdullah Saleh worsened Yemen&#x27;s social cohesion and nourished sectarian persuasions within Yemen&#x27;s society.

Following the Arab Spring and the Yemeni Revolution, Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to step down as president in 2012. Subsequently, a complex and violent power struggle broke out between three national alliances: (1) Ali Abdullah Saleh, his political party General People&#x27;s Congress, and the Houthis; (2) Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, supported by the political party Al-Islah; (3) Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, supported by the Joint Meeting Parties. According to Ibrahim Fraihat, “Yemen’s conflict has never been about sectarianism, as the Houthis were originally motivated by economic and political grievances. However, in 2014, the regional context substantially changed”. The Houthi takeover in 2014-2015 provoked a Saudi-led intervention, strengthening the sectarian dimension of the conflict. Hezbollah&#x27;s Hassan Nasrallah heavily criticized the Saudi intervention, bolstering the regional Sunni-Shia geopolitical dynamic behind it.

===Saudi Arabia===

Sectarianism in Saudi Arabia is exemplified through the tensions with its Shi’ite population, who constitute up to 15% of the Saudi population. This includes the anti-Shi’ite policies and persecution of the Shi’ites by the Saudi government. According to Human Rights Watch, Shi’ites face marginalisation socially, politically, religiously, legally and economically, whilst facing discrimination in education and in the workplace. This history dates back to 1744, with the establishment of a coalition between the House of Saud and the Wahhabis, who equate Shi’ism with polytheism. Over the course of the twentieth century clashes and tensions unfolded between the Shi’ites and the Saudi regime, including the 1979 Qatif Uprising and the repercussions of the 1987 Makkah Incident. Though relations underwent a détente in the 1990s and the early 2000s, tensions rose again after the 2003 US-led election of Iraq (owing to a broader rise of Shi’ism in the region) and peaked during the Arab Spring. Sectarianism in Saudi Arabia has attracted widespread attention by Human Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, especially after the execution of Shi&#x27;ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr in 2016, who was active in the 2011 domestic protests. Despite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#x27;s reforms, Shi’ites continue to face discrimination today.

===Lebanon===

Sectarianism in Lebanon has been formalized and legalized within state and non-state institutions and is inscribed in its constitution. Lebanon recognizes 18 different sects, mainly within Muslim and Christian worlds. The foundations of sectarianism in Lebanon date back to the mid-19th century during Ottoman rule. It was subsequently reinforced with the creation of the Republic of Lebanon in 1920 and its 1926 constitution and in the National Pact of 1943. In 1990, with the Taif Agreement, the constitution was revised but did not structurally change aspects relating to political sectarianism. The dynamic nature of sectarianism in Lebanon has prompted some historians and authors to refer to it as &quot;the sectarian state &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot; because it is a mixture of religious communities and their myriad sub-divisions, with a constitutional and political order to match. Yet, the reality on the ground has been more complex than such a conclusion, because as Nadya Sbaiti has shown in her research, in the aftermath of the First World War, the “need of shaping a collective future that paralleled shifting conceptions of the newly territorialized nation-state of Lebanon” was clearly present. “Over the course of the Mandate, educational practitioners and the wide range of schools that proliferated helped shape the epistemological infrastructure en route to creating this entity. By ‘epistemological infrastructure’, one means the cast array of ideas that become validated as truths and convincing explanations.” In other words, contrary to the colonial sectarian education system, “students, parents, and teachers created educational content through curricula, and educational practices so as to produce new ‘communities of knowledge’. These communities of knowledge, connected as they were by worlds of ideas and networks of knowledge, often transcended confessional, sociopolitical, and even at times regional subjectivities.” Some of these schools such as the &quot;Ahliyya National School for Girls&quot; would even go as far as to promote an anti-colonial stance among students to increase popular resistance towards French Mandate policies at the time This perspective therefore also uncovers the underlying factors at work within these historical events and confirms that such happenings were not inevitable but simply one of many paths for possible outcomes. In a more recent developent, the sectarian political system in Lebanon was questioned, as 2019-uprisings prompted &quot;calls to dismantle the system were both a culmination of the growth of multiple activist movements over the past decades—including the intersection of antisectarian, feminist, environmentalist, and queer rights strands—and an echo of earlier movements on the left.&quot;

<text>This article provides a summary of results for the general elections to the Canadian province of New Brunswick&#x27;s unicameral legislative body, the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. Prior to 1892, New Brunswick had a bicameral legislature, but its Upper House – the Legislative Council – was not elected. The number of seats has varied over time – from 41 at the time of Canadian Confederation, to a high of fifty-eight from 1967 through 1991, to the level of 55 since the 1995 election. Changing again in 2013 to 49 seats at which it remains today. 

Beginning with the 37th New Brunswick general election in 2010, elections in New Brunswick are – in general – held on fixed dates on the fourth Monday of September every four years. The date may be varied by one week earlier or later in cases of the fourth Monday of September being a date of cultural or religious significance and may be varied one month earlier or later in cases of a federal election being held during the same period. The llieutenant governor of New Brunswick also has the power to call an election on another date in the event of a loss of confidence in the legislature.

The chart on the upper right shows the information graphically, with the most recent elections towards the right. It shows that New Brunswick has effectively a two-party system – the Liberals (red) and the Conservatives (blue); along with the one-off success of the Confederation of Regions party (green) in 1991. It also shows the Liberal party&#x27;s clean sweep of seats in 1987, one of the few instances in history when a party won all the seats in a national or sub-national legislature. Since provincial parties were officially recognized, the Liberal party have won eleven out of twenty elections.

This article only covers elections since the province became part of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. Prior to becoming part of Canada, New Brunswick was a British colony; the New Brunswick House of Assembly was first formed in 1784 – when New Brunswick separated from Nova Scotia.

==1866–1934==
New Brunswick joined the Canadian confederation in 1867. Between 1917 and 1935, party lines had developed but were not recognized by electoral law. Before this, only &quot;Government&quot; and &quot;Opposition&quot; were used. The results are listed below.

==1935–present==
Between 1935 and the 1974 provincial election, some ridings were multi-member seats – i.e., more than one member of the Legislative Assembly was elected from certain ridings. Political parties were officially recognized and registered beginning in 1935. Since 1974, each riding (electoral district) has elected only one member to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick.

===Notes===
: Includes results for Progressive Conservatives.
: The Confederation of Regions Party only contested the 1991, 1995 and 1999 elections.

<doc id="398493" wikidata="Q796920" url="?curid=398493" title="BRD (Germany)">
<text>BRD ( ; English: FRG/Federal Republic of Germany) is an unofficial abbreviation for the Federal Republic of Germany, informally known in English as West Germany until 1990, and just Germany since reunification. It was occasionally used in the Federal Republic itself during the early Cold War; it was commonly used between 1968 and 1990 by the ruling party of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), resulting in a strong deprecation of its use in West Germany. The East German regime had previously used the term &quot;German Federal Republic&quot; (), which it abbreviated as &quot;DBR&quot;, to refer to West Germany. The most widely used abbreviation for West Germany in the country itself was its ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code &quot;DE&quot;, which has remained the country code of reunified Germany.

While the English equivalent FRG was used as an IOC country code and a FIFA trigramme, the use of &quot;BRD&quot; was strongly discouraged by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany itself from the 1970s, because it was considered to be a derogatory communist term following its widespread use in East Germany since 1968; thus the term was regarded as a possible expression of an extremist, anti-constitutional and anti-democratic sentiment by West German authorities. The term was not banned by law, but its use was discouraged or forbidden in schools in West Germany from the 1970s, and treated as an error. As a result of its use by East Germany and the war on the abbreviation by the West German government, far-left terrorists such as the Red Army Faction tended to use the term as a way to attack West Germany; additionally the term &quot;BRD&quot; has been used by some far-right groups for the same purpose. After German reunification, the country is usually referred to simply as Germany (&quot;&quot;), and hence the need for abbreviations is greatly diminished. However, since the end of the Cold War the term &quot;BRD&quot; has lost some of its potency as an insult intended to attack the Federal Republic of Germany, as it was used by East Germany and far-left terrorists such as the Red Army Faction, and the term &quot;BRD&quot; has been listed in the German dictionary Duden as an &quot;unofficial abbreviation&quot; for the Federal Republic of Germany since the 1990s, and is occasionally used by national newspapers across the political spectrum.

==History==
===Background===
The official name was and is &quot;Bundesrepublik Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Federal Republic of Germany&quot;). The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the Trizone, was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term &quot;Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Germany&quot;). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the Basic Law, allowing all states or &quot;Länder&quot;, then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and West Berlin did so. However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The Saarland joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the &quot;new states&quot; of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin.

Therefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the Cold War. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism &quot;BRD&quot; began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary Duden in 1967. The German Democratic Republic at first used the name &quot;Westdeutschland&quot; or &quot;West Germany&quot; (abbreviated &quot;WD&quot;) for the Federal Republic of Germany, but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany &quot;Deutsche Bundesrepublik&quot; or &quot;German Federal Republic&quot; (abbreviated &quot;DBR&quot;), because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name &quot;Germany&quot;.

===Use in East Germany===
This changed in 1968 with the new constitution of the German Democratic Republic. The communists no longer strove for German reunification, and the name &quot;BRD&quot; was introduced as a propaganda counter-term to the term &quot;DDR&quot;, trying to express the equality of the states. The West would speak of the &quot;sogenannte DDR&quot; or &quot;so-called &#x27;DDR&#x27;&quot; when intending to belittle East German statehood.

At that time, the initialism &quot;BRD&quot; had been adopted by &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot;, the ruling Socialist Unity Party&#x27;s daily newspaper, while East German official sources adopted that initialism as standard in 1973.

The East German decision to abandon the idea of a single German nation was accompanied by omitting the terms &quot;Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Germany&quot;) and &quot;deutsch&quot; (&quot;German&quot;) in a number of terms, for example:

* The governing National Front of Democratic Germany became the National Front of the German Democratic Republic in 1973
* The words of the national anthem, &quot;Auferstanden aus Ruinen&quot;, which referred to &quot;Deutschland, einig Vaterland&quot; (&quot;Germany, united fatherland&quot;) ceased to be sung following Erich Honecker succeeding Walter Ulbricht as party leader in 1971
* The state television service, Deutscher Fernsehfunk became &quot;Fernsehen der DDR&quot; in 1972, its radio counterpart having always been called Rundfunk der DDR or &quot;Radio of the GDR&quot;
* The North German Plain, covering the north of East and West Germany, appeared in East German atlases as &quot;Nördliches Tiefland der DDR&quot; (Northern Plain of the GDR).
* The GDR sent a separate team to the 1972 Summer Olympics, at which its flag and anthem were used for the first time Until 1959, the GDR had used an identical flag to that of the Federal Republic, before adopting a version with the national emblem in the centre.

However, the ruling party&#x27;s full name, &quot;Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands&quot; or &quot;Socialist Unity Party of Germany&quot; remained unchanged, as did that of its newspaper &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot; (&quot;New Germany&quot;) .
Therefore, using the abbreviation &quot;BRD&quot; fitted perfectly into the official East German policy of downplaying the concept of a united Germany. In 1974, the GDR had replaced the vehicle registration code &quot;D&quot;, hitherto shared with the Federal Republic, for &quot;DDR&quot; and demanded that West Germany recognise the division by likewise accepting &quot;BRD&quot;. 
This was rejected by the West, where some motorists displayed bumper stickers with the slogan &quot;BRD - Nein Danke!&quot; (&quot;BRD? No Thanks!&quot;). Thus in the West the initialism became even more objectionable and using it was often considered either unreflecting or even expressing naïve Communist sympathies.
As a result, the initialism reached only occasional frequency in West German parlance. In order to be precise West Germans increasingly used the terms &quot;Bundesrepublik&quot; or &quot;Bundesgebiet&quot; (&quot;Federal Republic&quot;, or &quot;Federal Territory&quot;) to refer to the country and &quot;Bundesbürger&quot; (&quot;Federal Citizen[s]&quot;) as to its citizens, with the pertaining adjective &quot;bundesdeutsch&quot; (federally German).

===Opposition to use in West Germany===
To distance themselves from the term &quot;BRD&quot;, until German reunification, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and media sometimes used the abbreviations &quot;BR Deutschland,&quot; &quot;BR-Dt.&quot;, &quot;BRDt.&quot;,
 &quot;BR Dtld.&quot; or simply &quot;Dtld.&quot; After the newly established states of the German Democratic Republic acceded to the Federal Republic, &quot;Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Germany&quot;) has always been used as the official short name.
West Germany had always claimed to be &quot;the&quot; Germany, and did not like the comparison to &quot;DDR&quot;, or two separate German states. This claim was also reflected in the Hallstein Doctrine determining its foreign and interior policy until the early 1970s. Named after Walter Hallstein, State secretary at the Foreign Office, this was a key doctrine in the foreign policy of West Germany after 1955, which prescribed that the Federal Republic of Germany would not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognised the GDR. Although this changed after 1973, with the Federal Republic no longer asserting an exclusive mandate over the whole of Germany, West Germany only established &quot;de facto&quot; diplomatic relations with East Germany. Under the terms of the Basic Treaty in 1972, Bonn and East Berlin exchanged &quot;permanent missions&quot;, headed by &quot;permanent representatives&quot;, rather than &quot;de jure&quot; embassies headed by ambassadors. Similarly, relations with the GDR were not conducted through the Foreign Office, but through a separate Federal Ministry for Intra-German Relations, to which the East German mission was accredited.

In 1965 the Federal Minister of All-German Affairs (later Intra-German Relations) issued the &quot;Directives for the appellation of Germany&quot; recommending that the use of &quot;BRD&quot; be avoided. On 31 May 1974 the heads of the federal and state governments recommended that the full name should always be used in official publications. In November 1979 the federal government informed the Bundestag that the West German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF agreed not to use the initialism.

Under the West German federal system, the states were generally responsible for school education, and by the 1970s, some of them had either already recommended omitting the initialism, or, in the case of Bavaria, forbidden it. Similarly, a decree by the educational authorities in the state of Schleswig-Holstein of 4 October 1976 declared the term to be &quot;nicht wünschenswert&quot; or &quot;undesirable&quot;. The conference of all the states ministers for school education decided on 12 February 1981 to not print the initialism in books, maps, and atlases for schools. with pupils being required to write &quot;Bundesrepublik Deutschland&quot; in full and use of the term being deemed an error. The different usages were so ingrained that one could deduce a person&#x27;s or source&#x27;s political leaning from the name used for West Germany, with far-left movements in the country using &quot;BRD&quot;.

However, as the Association for the German Language found, this debate on the initialism had little influence on changing the West German parlance with the usage of the initialism - in any event limited - unaffected by the debate.

==Naming difficulties over Berlin and East Germany==

A similar ideological question was the question whether to use &quot;Berlin (West)&quot; (the officially preferred name) or &quot;West Berlin&quot;, and even whether to write &quot;West Berlin&quot; in German as two hyphenated words - &quot;West-Berlin&quot; - or as one word - &quot;Westberlin&quot;.

Most Westerners called the Western sectors &quot;Berlin&quot;, unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government initially called West Berlin &quot;Groß-Berlin&quot; or &quot;Greater Berlin&quot;, but changed this &quot;Berlin (West)&quot;, although it also used the hyphenated &quot;West-Berlin&quot;. However, the East German government commonly referred to it as &quot;Westberlin&quot;. Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called &quot;Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR&quot; (Berlin, Capital of the GDR), replacing the formerly used term &quot;Democratic Berlin&quot;, or simply &quot;Berlin&quot;, by East Germany, and &quot;Berlin (Ost)&quot; by the West German Federal government. Other names used by West German media included &quot;Ost-Berlin&quot; and &quot;Ostberlin&quot; (both meaning &quot;East Berlin&quot;) as well as &quot;Ostsektor&quot; or &quot;Eastern Sector&quot;. These different naming conventions for the divided parts of Berlin, when followed by individuals, governments, or media, commonly indicated their political leanings, with the centre-right &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; using &quot;Ost-Berlin&quot; and the centre-left &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; using &quot;Ostberlin&quot;.

The naming of the German Democratic Republic was also a controversial issue, West Germans at first preferring the names &quot;Mitteldeutschland&quot; (&quot;Middle Germany&quot;) and &quot;Sowjetische Besatzungszone&quot; (Soviet Occupation Zone) abbreviated as &quot;SBZ&quot;. This only changed under Willy Brandt when West German authorities started using the official name, &quot;Deutsche Demokratische Republik&quot; or &quot;DDR&quot;, but many conservative German newspapers, like &quot;Bild&quot;, owned by the Springer company, always wrote &quot;DDR&quot; in scare quotes until 1 August 1989.

==Similar naming difficulties==

In 1995, a disagreement arose between reunified Germany and newly independent Slovakia, as Germany objected to the use of the Slovak language name &quot;Nemecká spolková republika&quot; (literally &quot;German Federal Republic&quot;) owing to its Cold War connotations, instead of &quot;Spolková republika Nemecko&quot;. This was almost identical to the equivalent &quot;Spolková republika Německo&quot; in Czech, a language closely related to Slovak, but the Slovak authorities claimed that &quot;Federal Republic of Germany&quot; could not be translated grammatically into Slovak. However, the Slovak government had used it until the previous year, leading to suggestions in the Bratislava newspaper &quot;Narodna Obroda&quot; that they were using &quot;German Federal Republic&quot; to show their displeasure with German attitudes to the country.

<text>The corvus (Latin for &quot;crow&quot; or &quot;raven&quot;) was a Roman ship mounted boarding ramp or drawbridge for naval boarding, first introduced during the First Punic War in sea battles against Carthage. It could swivel from side to side and was equipped with a beak-like iron hook at the far end of the bridge, from which the name is figuratively derived, intended to anchor the enemy ship.

The corvus was still used during the last years of the Republic. Appian mentions it being used on August 11th 36BC, during the battle of Mylae, by Octavian&#x27;s navy led by Marcus Agrippa against the navy of Sextus Pompeius led by Papias.

== Description ==
In Chapters 1.22-4-11 of his &quot;History&quot;, Polybius describes this device as a bridge 1.2 m (4 ft) wide and 10.9 m (36 ft) long, with a small parapet on both sides. The engine was probably used in the prow of the ship, where a pole and a system of pulleys allowed the bridge to be raised and lowered. There was a heavy spike shaped like a bird&#x27;s beak on the underside of the device, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship&#x27;s deck when the boarding bridge was lowered. This allowed a firm grip between the vessels and a route for the Roman legionaries (who served as specialized naval infantry called &quot;marinus&quot;) to cross onto and capture the enemy ship.

In the 3rd century BCE, Rome was not a naval power and had little experience in sea combat. Before the First Punic War began in 264 BCE, the Roman Republic had not campaigned outside the Italian Peninsula. The Republic&#x27;s military strength was in land-based warfare, and its main assets were the discipline and the courage of the Roman soldiers. The boarding bridge allowed the Romans to use their infantry advantage at sea, therefore helping to overcome the Carthaginians&#x27; superior naval experience and skills. The Romans&#x27; application of boarding tactics worked by winning several battles, most notably those of Mylae, Sulci, Tyndaris and Ecnomus.

Despite its advantages, the boarding bridge had a serious drawback in that it could not be used in rough seas; the stable connection of two bobbing ships endangered both ships&#x27; structures. When operating in rough conditions, the device became useless as a tactical weapon. The added weight on the prow may have also compromised the ship&#x27;s navigability, and it has been suggested that this instability led to Rome losing almost two entire fleets during storms in 255 and 249 BCE. Those losses may have contributed to Rome abandoning the boarding bridge in ship design over time.

However, a different analysis suggests that the added weight did not threaten ship stability. JW Bonebakker, formerly Professor of Naval Architecture at TU Delft, used an estimated &quot;corvus&quot; weight of one ton to conclude that it was &quot;most probable that the stability of a quinquereme with a displacement of about would &quot;not&quot; be seriously upset&quot; when the bridge was raised.

Regardless of the reasons, it appears that Rome was no longer using the corvus at the end of the First Punic War. As Rome&#x27;s ship crews became more experienced, Roman naval tactics also improved; accordingly, the relative utility of using the corvus as a weapon may have diminished. The device is not mentioned in period sources after the Battle of Ecnomus, and apparently, the Battle of the Aegates Islands decided the war in 241 BCE and was won without it. By 36 BCE, at the Battle of Naulochus, the Roman navy had been using a different kind of device to facilitate boarding attacks, a harpoon and winch system known as the &quot;harpax&quot;, or &quot;harpago&quot;.

== Modern interpretations ==
The design of the &quot;corvus&quot; has undergone many transformations throughout history. The earliest suggested modern interpretation of the &quot;corvus&quot; came in 1649 by German classicist Johann Freinsheim. Freinsheim suggested that the bridge consisted of two parts, one section measuring and the second being long. The section was placed along the prow mast and a hinge connected the smaller piece to the mast at the top. The smaller piece would have been the actual gangway as it could swing up and down, and the pestle was attached to the end.

The classical scholar and German statesman B.G. Niebuhr ventured to improve the interpretation of the &quot;corvus&quot; and proposed that the two parts of Freinsheim’s &quot;corvus&quot; simply needed to be swapped. By applying the side along the prow mast, the side could be lowered onto an enemy ship by means of the pulley.

The German scholar K.F. Haltaus hypothesized that the &quot;corvus&quot; was a long bridge with the near end braced against the mast via a small oblong notch in the near end that extended into the bridge. Haltaus suggested that a lever through the prow mast would have allowed the crew to turn the &quot;corvus&quot; by turning the mast. A pulley was placed on the top of a mast that raised the bridge in order to use the device.

The German classical scholar Wilhelm Ihne proposed another version of &quot;corvus&quot; that resembled Freinsheim’s crane with adjustments in the lengths of the sections of the bridge. His design placed the &quot;corvus&quot; twelve feet above the deck and had the &quot;corvus&quot; extend out from the mast a full with the base of the near end connected to the mast. The marines on deck would then be forced to climb a ladder to access to the &quot;corvus&quot;.

The French scholar Émile de St. Denis suggested the &quot;corvus&quot; featured a bridge with the mast hole set from the near end. The design suggested by de St. Denis, however, did not include an oblong hole and forced the bridge to travel up and down the mast completely perpendicular to the deck at all times.

The next step in that direction occurred in 1956, when the historian H.T. Wallinga published his dissertation &quot;The Boarding-Bridge of the Romans&quot;. It suggested a different full-beam design for the &quot;corvus&quot;, which became the most widely accepted model among scholars for the rest of the twentieth century. Wallinga&#x27;s design included the oblong notch in the deck of the bridge to allow it to rise at an angle by the pulley mounted on the top of the mast.

Not everybody, however, has accepted the idea that the Romans invented and used the &quot;corvus&quot; as a special device. In 1907, William W. Tarn postulated that the &quot;corvus&quot; never existed. Tarn believed that the weight of the bridge would be too much for the design of the Roman ships to remain upright. He suggested that once the &quot;corvus&quot; was raised, the ship would simply roll over and capsize by the weight added by the &quot;corvus&quot;. Tarn believed that the &quot;corvus&quot; was simply an improved version of an already-existing grapnel pole, which had been used in Greece as early as 413 BC.

<text>A paw is the soft foot-like part of a mammal, generally a quadruped, that has claws.

== Common characteristics ==
The paw is characterised by thin, pigmented, keratinised, hairless epidermis covering subcutaneous collagenous and adipose tissue, which make up the pads. These pads act as a cushion for the load-bearing limbs of the animal. The paw consists of the large, heart-shaped metacarpal or palmar pad (forelimb) or metatarsal or plantar pad (rear limb), and generally four load-bearing digital pads, although there can be five or six toes in the case of domestic cats and bears (including giant panda). A carpal pad is also found on the forelimb which is used for additional traction when stopping or descending a slope in digitigrade species. Additional dewclaws can also be present.

The paw also includes a horn-like, beak shaped claw on each digit. Though usually hairless, certain animals do have fur on the soles of their paws. An example is the red panda, whose furry soles help insulate them in their snowy habitat.

== Animals with paws ==
* Felids, such as cats and tigers; some of these animals may have toe tufts
* Canids, such as dogs and foxes
* Rabbits and other lagomorphs have paws with very sharp nails and have no pads underneath them
* Bears and raccoons
* Weasels and other mustelids
* Rodents

<doc id="398504" wikidata="Q3586951" url="?curid=398504" title="List of Quebec general elections">
<text>This article provides a summary of results for the general elections to the Canadian province of Quebec&#x27;s unicameral legislative body, the National Assembly of Quebec (and its predecessor, the Legislative Assembly of Quebec). The number of seats has generally increased over time, from 65 for the first six elections, to the current high of 125.

The chart on the upper right shows the information graphically, with the most recent elections towards the right.

The Conservative party (blue) in 1936 merged into the Union Nationale (now defunct). The 1970s saw the arrival of the sovereignist Parti Québécois, to be followed by Québec Solidaire and the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

This article only covers elections since the Canadian confederation in 1867, when Quebec was created as one of Canada&#x27;s provinces. For Quebec&#x27;s first 15 elections as Lower Canada from 1792 to 1840, see Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. For the 8 joint elections of Ontario and Quebec as the Province of Canada, from 1840 to 1867, see list of elections in the Province of Canada.

==Summary of results==

The table below shows the total number of seats won by the political parties in each election. It also shows the percentage of the vote obtained by each party. The winning party&#x27;s totals are shown in bold. There have been five elections (1998, 1966, 1944, 1892 and 1886) in which the winning party did not have the largest share of the popular vote. Full details on any election are linked via the year of the election at the start of the row.

<doc id="398518" wikidata="Q2621839" url="?curid=398518" title="Halfling">
<text>Halflings are a fictional race found in some fantasy works. They tend to be depicted as physically similar to humans, except about half as tall and not as stocky as the similarly sized dwarves. Halflings are often depicted as having slightly pointed ears along with leathery-soled feet which are covered with curly hair. They tend to be portrayed as stealthy and lucky. The term is derived for the word used in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Northern England for a child who is not yet fully grown. Halflings are found in many fantasy novels and games, including as an alternative term for hobbits in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth and as playable humanoid races in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&quot;

== Description ==
The members of the fictional halfling race are often depicted as similar to humans except about half as tall, and are not quite as stocky as the similarly sized dwarves. Similar to the depiction of hobbits in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, which are sometimes called halflings, they have slightly pointed ears, their feet are covered with curly hair with leathery soles, and they tend to be portrayed as stealthy and lucky.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Halfling&quot; is a word used in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Northern England for a boy or girl who is not yet fully grown; a youth, an adolescent, and formerly sometimes a boy or young man employed in a junior role in domestic, agricultural, or industrial work. &quot;Halflin&quot; derives from the Scot word &quot;hauflin&quot;, which was used before both &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and has the synonyms &quot;hobbledehoy&quot; and &quot;hobby&quot;.

==Usage in fantasy fiction==

Halflings are found in some fantasy novels and games. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, J. R. R. Tolkien occasionally used the term &quot;halfling&quot; to describe hobbits, since they are beings that are half the height of men. For instance, when the hobbit Pippin Took appears in a royal guard&#x27;s uniform in Minas Tirith, the people of that city call him the &quot;Prince of Halflings&quot;. The term has since been used in other fiction works as an alternate name for hobbit-like peoples inspired by Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium.

Halflings have long been one of the playable humanoid races in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D), starting with the original 1974 Men &amp; Magic, where the term &quot;hobbit&quot; was used. Later editions of the original D&amp;D box set began using the name &quot;halfling&quot; as an alternative to &quot;hobbit&quot; for legal reasons. Besides licensed D&amp;D novels, halfling characters have appeared in various tabletop and video games.

Some fantasy stories use the term &quot;halfling&quot; to describe a person born of a human parent and a parent of another race, often a female human and a male elf. Terry Brooks describes characters such as Shea Ohmsford from his &quot;Shannara&quot; series as a halfling of elf–human parentage. In Jack Vance&#x27;s &quot;Lyonesse&quot; series of novels, &quot;halfling&quot; is a generic term for beings such as fairies, trolls and ogres, who are composed of both magical and earthly substances. In Clifford D. Simak&#x27;s 1959 short story &quot;No Life of Their Own&quot;, halflings are invisible beings in a parallel dimension who, like brownies or gremlins, bring good or bad luck to people.

== Examples ==
An example of a noteworthy halfling character featured in a series of novels based on the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, a D&amp;D campaign setting, is Regis, a halfling rogue member of the &quot;Companions of the Hall&quot; led by Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden. While he behaves in the stereotypical manner of Tolkien&#x27;s hobbits, Bricken from &quot;io9&quot; noted that Regis &quot;set himself apart a bit by carrying a crystal pendant he can use to charm people&quot;, though he also finds himself in dangerous situations and ends up saving the day in the final battle of &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot; (1988) in a manner not unlike Bilbo Baggins.

<text>Nathan Mayer Rothschild (16 September 1777 – 28 July 1836), also known as Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild, was a British-German banker, businessman and financier. Born in Frankfurt am Main, he was the third of the five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his wife, Guttle (née Schnapper). He was the founder of the British branch of the prominent Rothschild family.

==Early life, origins in Frankfurt==
Nathan Mayer Rothschild was born on 16 September 1777 to Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Guttle Schnapper in the Jewish ghetto area of Frankfurt in the Holy Roman Empire (in present-day Germany). He was born to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. He was the third son, and his brothers were Amschel Mayer Rothschild, Salomon Mayer Rothschild, Carl Mayer Rothschild and James Mayer Rothschild. All five brothers would go on to become close business partners spread out across Europe. They had five sisters, including Henriette Rothschild, who married Abraham Montefiore.

==Move to England and involvement in textile trade==
In 1798, at the age of 21, he settled in Manchester, England, and established a business in textile trading and finance. He later moved to London and began dealing on the London Stock Exchange from 1804. He made a fortune in trading bills of exchange through a banking enterprise begun in 1805, dealing with financial instruments such as foreign bills and government securities.

Rothschild became a freemason of the Emulation Lodge, No. 21, of the Premier Grand Lodge of England on 24 October 1802, in London. Up until this point, the few Ashkenazi Jews who lived in England tended to belong to the &quot;Antients&quot; on account of their generally lower social class, while the more established Sephardim joined the Moderns.

==Gold, securities trading and the Napoleonic Wars==

From 1809, Rothschild began to deal in gold bullion and developed this as a cornerstone of his business, which was to become N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons. From 1811 on, in negotiation with Commissary-General John Charles Herries, he undertook to transfer money to pay Wellington&#x27;s troops, on campaign in Portugal and Spain against Napoleon, and later to make subsidy payments to British allies when these organized new troops after Napoleon&#x27;s disastrous Russian campaign.

Later, during the 1840s, as early socialists in France (such as Alphonse Toussenel and Pierre Leroux) attacked the Rothschilds and &quot;Jewish financiers&quot; in general, a French socialist from among their circle, Georges Marie Mathieu-Dairnvaell using the penname &quot;Satan&quot;, authored a work entitled &quot;Histoire édifiante et curieuse de Rothschild Ier, Roi des Juifs&quot; (&quot;Edifying and Curious History of Rothschild the First, King of the Jews&quot;). Within it, he made claims about Nathan Mayer Rothschild&#x27;s early knowledge of the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo, whose couriers delivered information about the victory back to London before the British Cabinet itself knew, claiming that he used this knowledge to speculate on the London Stock Exchange and make a vast fortune by unfair advantage against the other British stock holders, essentially defrauding them.

Frederic Morton relates the story thus:

To the Rothschilds, [England&#x27;s] chief financial agents, Waterloo brought a many million pound scoop. ... a Rothschild agent ... jumped into a boat at Ostend ... Nathan Rothschild ... let his eye fly over the lead paragraphs. A moment later he was on his way to London (beating Wellington&#x27;s envoy by many hours) to tell the government that Napoleon had been crushed: but his news was not believed, because the government had just heard of the English defeat at Quatre Bras. Then he proceeded to the Stock Exchange. Another man in his position would have sunk his work into consols [bank annuities], already weak because of Quatre Bras. But this was Nathan Rothschild. He leaned against &quot;his&quot; pillar. He did not invest. He sold. He dumped consols. ... Consols dropped still more. &quot;Rothschild knows,&quot; the whisper rippled through the &#x27;Change. &quot;Waterloo is lost.&quot; Nathan kept on selling, ... consols plummeted – until, a split second before it was too late, Nathan suddenly bought a giant parcel for a song. Moments afterwards the great news broke, to send consols soaring. We cannot guess the number of hopes and savings wiped out by this engineered panic.

The Rothschild family and others have claimed that this embellished version of events originated in Mathieu-Dairnvaell&#x27;s 1846 writing, was further embellished by John Reeves in 1887 in &quot;The Rothschilds: the Financial Rulers of Nations&quot;, and then repeated in other popular accounts like that of Morton and the 1934 American film directed by Alfred L. Werker, &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot;.
Historian Niall Ferguson agrees that the Rothschilds&#x27; couriers did get to London first and alerted the family to Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, but argues that since the family had been banking on a protracted military campaign, the losses arising from the disruption to their business more than offset any short-term gains in bonds after Waterloo. Rothschild capital did soar, but over a much longer period: Nathan&#x27;s breakthrough had been prior to Waterloo when he negotiated a deal to supply cash to Wellington&#x27;s army. The family made huge profits over a number of years from this governmental financing by adopting a high-risk strategy involving exchange-rate transactions, bond-price speculations, and commissions.

The Rothschild family archives confirm that, although &quot;it is virtually part of English history that Nathan Mayer Rothschild made &#x27;a million&#x27; or &#x27;millions&#x27; out of his early information about the Battle of Waterloo, the evidence is slender&quot;. It notes the presence in the archives of a contemporary letter from a Rothschild courier, John Roworth, who wrote to Nathan: &quot;I am informed by Commissary White that you have done well by the early information which you had of the Victory gained at Waterloo.&quot; The archivists suggest that this comment – the only hard evidence of Rothschild making a fortune going long on UK gilts – may, in fact, have been a reference to business dealings between Rothschild and the British Government, as suggested by Ferguson. (The contract for supplying cash to Wellington&#x27;s army had been offered precisely because of Rothschild&#x27;s international network. &quot;The Government had already failed to establish a similar network of its own and had been let down by other more established London firms, and the Rothschild courier and communications network had gained a justifiable reputation for speed and reliability.&quot;) It confirms that the Rothschild couriers brought news of victory at Waterloo &quot;a full 48 hours before the government’s own riders brought the news to Downing Street&quot;, but the archive has no records to estimate the size of any gain Rothschild made. &quot;But knowing the structure of the market we can conclude that however much Nathan made out of Waterloo, it must have been very considerably less than a million pounds, let alone &#x27;millions&#x27;.&quot;

It is also very commonly reported that the Rothschilds&#x27; advanced information was caused by the speed of prized racing pigeons, held by the family. However, this is widely disputed and the Rothschild archive states that, although pigeon post &quot;was one of the tools of success in the Rothschild business strategy during the period c. 1820–1850... it is likely that a series of couriers on horseback brought the news&quot; of Waterloo to Rothschild.

More recently, Brian Cathcart has refuted the claim that Rothschild was the first man in London to know of the victory at Waterloo. He traces the earliest news to a dispatch Wellington sent via his messenger to Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of War, which was received on the evening of 21 June.

==Family ascent to prominence==

In 1816, his four brothers were raised to the nobility (&quot;Adelung&quot;) by the Emperor of Austria. They were now permitted to prefix the Rothschild name with the particle &quot;von&quot;, although outside the German-speaking world it was common practice across Europe to use the language of diplomacy, rendering names and titles in French, in this case: &quot;de&quot;.

In 1818 he arranged a £5 million loan to the Prussian government and the issuing of bonds for government loans formed a mainstay of his bank&#x27;s business. He gained a position of such power in the City of London that by 1825–1826 he was able to supply enough coin to the Bank of England to enable it to avert a liquidity crisis.

It appears that Nathan Mayer was the originator of the family device of the &#x27;Five Arrows&#x27;. The origin is said to be a Persian tale told to the Patriarch, Mayer Amschel, as the family gathered around his death-bed, when he is said to have observed that the tale was applicable to his own family: individually an arrow may be easily broken, but when held as a bundle they would be unbreakable. In 1818, Nathan Meyer applied for a grant of arms, on learning that gentry status would suffice, and had the Five Arrows confirmed for himself and his wider family.

===Title===
In 1822, all five brothers were granted the title of Baron, or raised to the &quot;Freiherrnstand&quot;, by the Emperor. From 1822, both Nathan Mayer himself, and any legitimate male descendant, could call himself: &quot;Freiherr von Rothschild&quot;, or in the language of diplomacy whether in France or not, &quot;Baron de Rothschild&quot;. In practice, having accepted the aristocratic title for the benefit of his family, he chose not to use it himself and so did not request official recognition of the title. In 1838, two years after his death, Queen Victoria did authorise the use of this Austrian title in the United Kingdom.

In 1824, together with his brother-in-law, Sir Moses Montefiore, he founded the Alliance Assurance Company, which later merged with Sun Insurance to form Sun Alliance.

==Slavery==
In the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837, Rothschild and his business partner Moses Montefiore loaned the British Government £15 million (worth £ in 2025) with interest which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015). This money was used to compensate the slave owners in the British Empire after slavery had been abolished. According to the &quot;Legacies of British Slave-Ownership&quot; at the University College London, Rothschild himself was a successful claimant under the scheme being a beneficiary as mortgage holder to a plantation in the colony of Antigua (present day Antigua and Barbuda) which included 158 enslaved Black people. He received a £2,571 compensation payment, at the time (worth £ in 2025)

==Later dealings and death==
In 1835 he secured a contract with the Spanish Government giving him the rights to the Almadén mines in southern Spain, effectively gaining a European mercury monopoly. In June 1836 he traveled to Frankfurt to attend his son Lionel&#x27;s wedding, but became too ill to return home and died in Frankfurt at the age of 58 on 28 July as a result of an infected abscess.

His body was brought to London for burial, with the funeral procession on 8 August from his house on New Court in the City of London to the Brady Street Ashkenazi Cemetery in Whitechapel accompanied by three police Superintendents (those of the London City Police and of H and K Divisions of the new Metropolitan Police), William Taylor Copeland (Lord Mayor of London) and contingents from the Jews&#x27; Orphan Asylum and the Jews&#x27; Free School, and the graveside address given by Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschell. Nathan&#x27;s wife Hannah was later buried alongside him.

==Legacy==

By the time of his death, his personal net worth amounted to 0.62% of British national income. He had also secured the position of the Rothschilds as the preeminent investment bankers in Britain and Europe. His son, Lionel Nathan Rothschild (1808–1879), continued the family business in England. During his life, Nathan Mayer Rothschild, as the most accomplished of his brothers, solidified the Rothschild family as a major power in European and thus world affairs. Their great rivals, the Baring family, said of Nathan Mayer and his family; &quot;They are generally well planned, with great cleverness and adroitness in execution -- but he is in money and funds what Bonaparte was in war.&quot; 

The German poet Heinrich Heine, a Jewish convert to Lutheranism, declared &quot;money is the God of our time and Rothschild is his prophet&quot;, he described Nathan Mayer Rothschild as one of &quot;three terroristic names that spell the gradual annihilation of the old aristocracy&quot;, alongside Cardinal Richelieu and Maximilien Robespierre. For Heine, Richelieu had destroyed the power of the old feudal aristocracy, Robespierre had &quot;decapitated&quot; its weakened remnant and now Rothschild signified the creation of a new social elite, as new lords of finance. The financial system which the Rothschilds created during this period was viewed as a revolutionary development, with a cosmopolitan emphasis, due to the high liquidity of assets in the new system based in bonds, instead of being based in land.

==Personal life==
On 22 October 1806 in London, he married Hannah Barent-Cohen (1783–1850), daughter of Levy Barent Cohen (1747–1808) and wife Lydia Diamantschleifer. Hannah Barent-Cohen was the aunt of Benjamin Frederik David Philips, the founder of Philips, and Karl Heinrich Marx. Hannah&#x27;s sister, Judith Barent-Cohen, was the wife of Sir Moses Montefiore. Nathan and Hannah&#x27;s children were:

# Charlotte Rothschild (1807–1859) married 1826 Anselm von Rothschild (1803–1874) Vienna.
# Lionel Nathan (1808–1879) married 1836 Charlotte von Rothschild (1819–1884) Naples
# Anthony Nathan (1810–1876) married 1840 Louise Montefiore (1821–1910)
# Nathaniel (1812–1870) married 1842 Charlotte de Rothschild (1825–1899) Paris
# Hannah Mayer (1815–1864) married 1839 Hon. Henry FitzRoy (1807–1859)
# Mayer Amschel (1818–1874) married 1850 Juliana Cohen (1831–1877)
# Louise von Rothschild (1820–1894) married 1842 to her first cousin Mayer Carl von Rothschild (1820–1886) Frankfurt

==Description==
Elizabeth Longford describes Nathan Mayer Rothschild as &quot;a financier with prominent blue eyes, light reddish curls and an astute humorous expression.&quot;

An anonymous contemporary described Nathan Rothschild at the London Stock Exchange as &quot;he leaned against the &#x27;Rothschild Pillar&#x27; ... hung his heavy hands into his pockets, and began to release silent, motionless, implacable cunning&quot;:

<text>Baron Abraham Edmond Benjamin James de Rothschild (; 19 August 1845 – 2 November 1934) was a French member of the Rothschild banking family. A strong supporter of Jewish settlement in Palestine, his large donations lent significant support to the First Aliyah, which helped lead to the establishment of the State of Israelwhere he is simply known as &quot;The Baron Rothschild&quot;, &quot;HaBaron&quot; (), or &quot;Hanadiv Hayeduah&quot; ().

== Early years ==
A member of the French branch of the Rothschild banking dynasty, he was born in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine, the youngest child of James Mayer Rothschild and Betty von Rothschild. He grew up in the world of the Second Republic and the Second Empire and was a soldier &quot;Garde Mobile&quot; in the Franco-Prussian War.

In 1877, he married Adelheid von Rothschild of Naples, the daughter of Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild, one of the Rothschild banking family of Naples, with whom he had three children: James Armand Edmond, Maurice Edmond Karl and Miriam Caroline Alexandrine.

== Artistic and philanthropic interests ==
=== Art, science and academy ===
Edmond de Rothschild inherited Château Rothschild in Boulogne-Billancourt and, in 1877, acquired the Château d&#x27;Armainvilliers in Gretz-Armainvilliers in the Seine-et-Marne &quot;département.&quot;

Edmond took little active part in banking but pursued artistic and philanthropic interests, helping to found scientific research institutions such as the Institut Henri Poincaré, the Institut de Biologie physico-chimique, the pre-Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the Casa Velázquez in Madrid, and the French Institute in London. In 1907, as a cofounder member, he also provided funds and support for the foundation of the Friends of the French National Museum of Natural History Society. He served as a member of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts and through it sponsored the archaeological digs of Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau in Egypt, Eustache de Lorey in Ottoman Syria, and Raymond Weill in Palestine.

Edmond de Rothschild acquired an important collection of drawings and engravings that he bequeathed to the Louvre consisting of more than 40,000 engravings, nearly 3,000 drawings, and 500 illustrated books. Included in this gift were more than one hundred engravings and drawings by Rembrandt. A portion of his art collection was bequeathed to his son James A. de Rothschild and is now part of the National Trust collection at Waddesdon Manor. However, in 1882 Edmond cut back on his purchases of art and began to buy land in Ottoman Palestine.

Rothschild also sponsored archaeological excavations, including those undertaken by Judith Marquet-Krause at Et-Tell.

=== Zionism ===
Although he remained separate from the Zionist movement, and &quot;rejected institutional and ideological Zionism,&quot; The Baron Rothschild became an avid supporter of Jewish settlement in Palestine financing the site at Rishon LeZion. In his goal for the establishment of Palestine as a home for Jewish settlement, he promoted industrialization and economic development. In 1924, he established the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association (PICA), which acquired more than of land and set up business ventures.

Edmond de Rothschild also played a pivotal role in Israel&#x27;s wine industry. Under the supervision of his administrators in Ottoman Palestine, farm colonies and vineyards were established, and two major wineries were opened in Rishon LeZion and Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov. It is estimated that Rothschild spent over $50 million in supporting the settlements and backed research in electricity by engineers and financed development of an electric generating station.

Rothschild funded a glass factory that would supply bottles for his wineries. Rothschild met Meir Dizengoff in Paris and chose Dizengoff to launch and manage the new factory, called Mizaga. Dizengoff opened the factory in Tantura in 1892 and managed the factory for approximately two years. Mizaga was the first Jewish-owned factory in Ottoman Palestine.

Jews and Arabs lived amicably on Rothschild&#x27;s land, with no Arab grievances, even in the worst periods of disturbance. According to historian Albert M. Hyamson, &quot;Rothschild recognised that the overriding interest of the Jews of Palestine was the confidence and the friendship of their Arab neighbours. The interests of the Arab cultivators of the land he bought were never overlooked, but by development he made this land capable of maintaining a population ten times its former size.&quot; While Edmond de Rothschild was not always supportive of an inclusive government—he suggested in 1931 to Judah Magnes that &quot;We must hold them (the Arabs) down with a strong hand&quot;—he acknowledged the importance of co-governance and peaceful coexistence in a 1934 letter to the League of Nations, stating that &quot;the struggle to put an end to the Wandering Jew, could not have as its result, the creation of the Wandering Arab.&quot;

== Death ==

In 1934, Baron de Rothschild died at Château Rothschild, Boulogne-Billancourt. His wife died a year later on 29 December 1935. They were interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris until April 1954 when their remains were transported to Israel aboard a naval frigate.

At the port of Haifa, the ship was met with sirens and a 19-gun salute. A state funeral was held with former Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion giving the eulogy following which Edmond de Rothschild and his wife were re-interred atop a hill near Haifa in what today is called Ramat HaNadiv (The Generous one&#x27;s Heights) Memorial Gardens, near the towns of Zichron Ya&#x27;akov (in Memoriam of Jacob, which is James in English) and Binyamina (&quot;of little Benjamin&quot;), both of which he helped fund, and are named in his honor. The open space at Ramat HaNadiv and the Rothschild family charity Yad HaNadiv (&quot;The generous one&#x27;s hand&quot; and also &quot;The generous one&#x27;s memory&quot;), are all as well named in honor of the Baron and his famous philanthropy in Palestine. Both named in his honor, where HaNadiv translates to English as &quot;generous&quot;, seen in the families later Israeli charitable foundation Yad Hanadiv. Started in 1954, (the very same year the Baron and his wife were buried in Israel) to carry on the legacy of Edmond&#x27;s earlier philanthropy in Palestine, and his colony association, the PICA.

== Commemoration ==
For his Jewish philanthropy Baron Edmond became known as &quot;HaNadiv HaYadu&#x27;a&quot;, (Hebrew for &quot;The Known Benefactor&quot; or &quot;The Famous Benefactor&quot;) and in his memory his son bequeathed the funds to construct the building for the Knesset.

Israel&#x27;s 1982/5742 Independence Day coin is dedicated to the memory of Edmond de Rothschild and marks the centenary of his first projects in Israel. From 1982 until 1986, the Bank of Israel used his portrait on the 500 Israeli sheqel note.

Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv is named after him, as well as various localities throughout Israel which he assisted in founding. Rishon LeZion, the city which he helped to found named one of the central streets Rothschild Street, and in 1996 Rothschild Mall was built. Also named after him is the &quot;Parc Edmond de Rothschild&quot; (Edmond de Rothschild Park) in Boulogne-Billancourt.
