<text>A Fermi problem (or Fermi question, Fermi quiz), also known as an order-of-magnitude problem, is an estimation problem in physics or engineering education, designed to teach dimensional analysis or approximation of extreme scientific calculations. Fermi problems are usually back-of-the-envelope calculations. Fermi problems typically involve making justified guesses about quantities and their variance or lower and upper bounds. In some cases, order-of-magnitude estimates can also be derived using dimensional analysis. A Fermi estimate (or order-of-magnitude estimate, order estimation) is an estimate of an extreme scientific calculation.

The estimation technique is named after physicist Enrico Fermi as he was known for his ability to make good approximate calculations with little or no actual data.

== Historical background ==
An example is Enrico Fermi&#x27;s estimate of the strength of the atomic bomb that detonated at the Trinity test, based on the distance traveled by pieces of paper he dropped from his hand during the blast. Fermi&#x27;s estimate of 10 kilotons of TNT was well within an order of magnitude of the now-accepted value of 21 kilotons.

== Justification ==
Fermi estimates generally work because the estimations of the individual terms are often close to correct, and overestimates and underestimates help cancel each other out. That is, if there is no consistent bias, a Fermi calculation that involves the multiplication of several estimated factors (such as the number of piano tuners in Chicago) will probably be more accurate than might be first supposed.

In detail, multiplying estimates corresponds to adding their logarithms; thus one obtains a sort of Wiener process or random walk on the logarithmic scale, which diffuses as formula_1 (in number of terms &quot;n&quot;). In discrete terms, the number of overestimates minus underestimates will have a binomial distribution. In continuous terms, if one makes a Fermi estimate of &quot;n&quot; steps, with standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; units on the log scale from the actual value, then the overall estimate will have standard deviation formula_2, since the standard deviation of a sum scales as formula_1 in the number of summands.

For instance, if one makes a 9-step Fermi estimate, at each step overestimating or underestimating the correct number by a factor of 2 (or with a standard deviation 2), then after 9 steps the standard error will have grown by a logarithmic factor of formula_4, so 23 = 8. Thus one will expect to be within to 8 times the correct value – within an order of magnitude, and much less than the worst case of erring by a factor of 29 = 512 (about 2.71 orders of magnitude). If one has a shorter chain or estimates more accurately, the overall estimate will be correspondingly better.

==Examples==
Fermi questions are often extreme in nature, and cannot usually be solved using common mathematical or scientific information.

Example questions given by the official Fermi Competition:
Possibly the most famous order-of-magnitude problem is the Fermi paradox, which considers the odds of a significant number of intelligent civilizations existing in the galaxy, and ponders the apparent contradiction of human civilization never having encountered any. A well-known attempt to ponder this paradox through the lens of a Fermi estimate is the Drake equation, which seeks to estimate the number of such civilizations present in the galaxy.

==Advantages and scope==

Scientists often look for Fermi estimates of the answer to a problem before turning to more sophisticated methods to calculate a precise answer. This provides a useful check on the results. While the estimate is almost certainly incorrect, it is also a simple calculation that allows for easy error checking, and to find faulty assumptions if the figure produced is far beyond what we might reasonably expect. By contrast, precise calculations can be extremely complex but with the expectation that the answer they produce is correct. The far larger number of factors and operations involved can obscure a very significant error, either in mathematical process or in the assumptions the equation is based on, but the result may still be assumed to be right because it has been derived from a precise formula that is expected to yield good results. Without a reasonable frame of reference to work from it is seldom clear if a result is acceptably precise or is many degrees of magnitude (tens or hundreds of times) too big or too small. The Fermi estimation gives a quick, simple way to obtain this frame of reference for what might reasonably be expected to be the answer.

As long as the initial assumptions in the estimate are reasonable quantities, the result obtained will give an answer within the same scale as the correct result, and if not gives a base for understanding why this is the case. For example, suppose a person was asked to determine the number of piano tuners in Chicago. 
If their initial estimate told them there should be a hundred or so, but the precise answer tells them there are many thousands, then they know they need to find out why there is this divergence from the expected result. First looking for errors, then for factors the estimation did not take account of – does Chicago have a number of music schools or other places with a disproportionately high ratio of pianos to people? Whether close or very far from the observed results, the context the estimation provides gives useful information both about the process of calculation and the assumptions that have been used to look at problems.

Fermi estimates are also useful in approaching problems where the optimal choice of calculation method depends on the expected size of the answer. For instance, a Fermi estimate might indicate whether the internal stresses of a structure are low enough that it can be accurately described by linear elasticity; or if the estimate already bears significant relationship in scale relative to some other value, for example, if a structure will be over-engineered to withstand loads several times greater than the estimate.

Although Fermi calculations are often not accurate, as there may be many problems with their assumptions, this sort of analysis does inform one what to look for to get a better answer. For the above example, one might try to find a better estimate of the number of pianos tuned by a piano tuner in a typical day, or look up an accurate number for the population of Chicago. It also gives a rough estimate that may be good enough for some purposes: if a person wants to start a store in Chicago that sells piano tuning equipment, and calculates that they need 10,000 potential customers to stay in business, they can reasonably assume that the above estimate is far enough below 10,000 that they should consider a different business plan (and, with a little more work, they could compute a rough upper bound on the number of piano tuners by considering the most extreme &quot;reasonable&quot; values that could appear in each of their assumptions).

<doc id="406892" wikidata="Q648392" url="?curid=406892" title="Parramatta River">
<text>The Parramatta River is an intermediate tide-dominated, drowned valley estuary located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. With an average depth of , the Parramatta River is the main tributary of Sydney Harbour, a branch of Port Jackson. Secondary tributaries include the smaller Lane Cove and Duck rivers.

Formed by the confluence of Toongabbie Creek and Darling Mills Creek at North Parramatta, the river flows in an easterly direction to a line between Yurulbin in Birchgrove and Manns Point in Greenwich. Here, it flows into Port Jackson, about from the Tasman Sea. The total catchment area of the river is approximately and is tidal to Charles Street Weir in Parramatta, approximately from the Sydney Heads.

The land adjacent to the Parramatta River was occupied for many thousands of years by Aboriginal peoples of the Wallumettagal nations and the Wangal, Toongagal (or Tugagal), Burramattagal, and Wategora clans of the Darug people. They used the river as an important source of food and a place for trade. The river was formed 15 to 29 million years ago as its waters began to cut a valley into sandstone and shale.

==Inflowing waterways==
The headwaters of the Parramatta River are formed by the confluence of Darling Mills Creek and Toongabbie Creek. The point of the confluence lies on the northern border of the grounds of Cumberland Hospital. It also lies on the boundary of the suburbs of Westmead, Northmead, and North Parramatta.

Waterways flowing into the Parramatta River, westtoeast include:
* Vineyard Creek at Rydalmere, from the north
* Ponds Subiaco Creek at Rydalmere, from the north
* Duck River at Silverwater, from the south
* Archer Creek at Meadowbank, from the north
* Smalls Creek at Meadowbank, from the far north
* Charity Creek at Meadowbank, from the north
* Haslams Creek at Homebush Bay, from the south
* Powells Creek at Homebush Bay, from the south
* Iron Cove Creek at Five Dock, from the south
* Hawthorne Canal at Iron Cove, from the south
* Tarban Creek at Huntleys Point, from the north
* Lane Cove River at Greenwich, from the north

==The river in Parramatta==

From its start at the confluence of Toongabbie Creek and Darling Mills Creek at North Parramatta, the river flows in a southerly direction through the grounds of Cumberland Hospital. Entering Parramatta Park, it then turns east and flows through the Parramatta CBD. Both banks are largely open to the public, with parkland and walkways, downstream to James Ruse Drive. The river is fed by a number of small creeks and stormwater drains.

The waters are controlled by a series of weirs: the weir at the edge of the hospital grounds, the Kiosk Weir in Parramatta Park, the Marsden Street Weir, and the Charles Street Weir at the ferry wharf. The weirs have been equipped with fish ladders. Kiosk Weir and Charles Street Weir also include footbridges enabling a crossing of the river. 

Historically, the river was dammed to provide reservoirs for the town. Currently, however, the function of the weirs is aesthetic, preventing the water from draining away during dry periods. As a consequence the river floods in heavy rain, particularly at the Charles Street Weir. The Charles Street Weir forms the boundary between fresh water and salt water, and is also the limit of tides.

==River governance==
The whole of Sydney Harbour including its tributary rivers is subject to a long range Catchment Management Plan. The Government has almost eliminated local representation by eliminating the former local catchment management boards.

The New South Wales Government has a documented policy in relation to access to the harbour and river foreshores, including public access to intertidal lands where landowners have absolute waterfronts but where the waterfront is exposed at low tide. Moorings and jetties are the responsibility of Transport for NSW, who are also responsible for the management of the Harbour and river seabed. Many bays contain swing moorings, mostly privately owned, but some associated with commercial marinas.

Along the Parramatta River many hands have made lighter work, in the community-wide effort to make the entire river swimmable again by 2025, starting with the opening of Lake Parramatta in 2014. 13 councils sit within the Parramatta River catchment group and all have committed to tackling the two major polluters: sewer overflows and stormwater.

==Transport==

===Ferry services and wharves===

There are River Cat services along the Parramatta River to Circular Quay. The main wharves, westtoeast are:
===Crossings===

The Parramatta River, along with Sydney Harbour, is the most significant waterway in Sydney. Since settlement, the river and the harbour have presented a formidable barrier between the earlyEuropean settled southern Farm Cove precinct, to development north of the waterway. Together, Parramatta River and Port Jackson literally cut Sydney in half along its northsouth axis.

As a result, the many crossings are extremely important to the life of the city. From westtoeast, the crossings of the Parramatta River are located at:
==Ecological and environment==

===Water quality concerns===

Until 1970 the river was an open drain for Sydney&#x27;s industry and consequently the southern central embayments are contaminated with a range of heavy metals and chemicals. The Northern Bays are less affected as the Sydney Harbour Bridge was not completed until 1932 and so industrial development was already well established on the southern side of the Harbour.

Gavin Birch of the University of Sydney has published a number of papers which show that Sydney Harbour is as contaminated as most other harbours in industrialised cities, that the main sediment contamination is in the southern central embayments (Blackwattle to Homebush Bays), that there are five particularly contaminated areas of Sydney Harbour, and that four of them are in the Parramatta river system.

The main contaminated areas of the Parramatta River are:
* Homebush Bay - dioxins, lead, phthalates, DDT, PAHs (coal tars) mainly originating from nearby chemical factories of Berger Paints, CSR Chemicals, ICI/Orica, and Union Carbide.
* Iron Cove - various metals and chemicals with no clearly defined point source. Pollution may possibly enter through Iron Cove Creek and Hawthorne Canal.
* Adjacent to the former AGL site, now redeveloped as Breakfast Point.

Water quality is monitored by the Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales) (OEH) for faecal coliforms and e. coli, but only as far west as Cabarita. OEH does not monitor water quality further west on the river, despite increasing development and the use of the river for recreational boating. In the areas monitored, the water quality is generally acceptable except after heavy rains.

===Fishing===
The Parramatta River is subject to a number of fishing bans because of its contaminated sediments. There is a complete fishing ban in Homebush Bay because of the dioxin contamination. In 2006, the NSW Government imposed a complete commercial fishing ban throughout the rest of Sydney Harbour and its tributaries, including the Parramatta River west of the Harbour Bridge, which remained in place until 2011.

The Parramatta River is one of the few significant coastal rivers in New South Wales which has not been the subject of an investigation by the Healthy Rivers Commission. The Cooks River and Botany Bay have been subject to such an investigation. Some have campaigned for a Healthy Rivers Commission inquiry to bring together all the information on the state of the river and its sediments and fish and assist in watershed management.

===Major wetlands and environmentally sensitive areas===
Major wetlands include:
* Bicentennial Park Wetlands (nationally significant, JAMBA CAMBA)
* Newington Wetlands (nationally significant, JAMBA CAMBA)

There are significant stands of mangroves along the river west of Henley (on the river&#x27;s northern shore) and Mortlake (on the river&#x27;s southern shore) and in the Lane Cove River. The mangroves have actually colonised areas that were previously salt marsh. Research into historical drawings and writings indicates that the mangroves were far fewer at English colonisation. Council information panels in Glades Bay explain that the bay&#x27;s now extensive mangrove stands would once have been open water, sandy beaches and outcrops of rock. Land clearing and development has allowed soil and various nutrients to be washed into the river. This has provided an ideal environment for mangroves to colonise. The excessive siltation of the river is an ongoing problem.

===Reclamation===
Many areas of the river, particularly the swampy heads of bays, have been reclaimed, often being used as rubbish dumps before being converted into playing fields. Large sections of Meadowbank Park were created in this manner. Some industrial sites were also reclaimed heavily from the river, particularly in Homebush Bay. Most creeks leading into the bays have been channelised (lined with concrete walls and floor).

===Remediation===
While some areas of the river with heavily contaminated sediments have not been remediated, there is significant remediation of sediments about to start in Homebush Bay. These include the dioxin contaminated sediments near the former Union Carbide plant and the lead contaminated sediments near the former Berger Paints plant. The former AGL site has been analysed, a remediation plan developed and approved, remediation completed and construction commenced on medium to high density residential development, but the sediments, which independent research shows to be contaminated with pollutants from the AGL operations, have not yet had the investigation stage finalised ().

Other areas have had sediments covered with concrete to prevent the fish eating the benthos. Some of these companies claim that the contamination is best left alone, but environmentalists have argued that the contamination could be being passed up the food chain and claim that the companies are trying to avoid the costs incurred in pollution cleanup.

==Recreational activities==

===Sailing===
There are a number of sailing and yachting clubs on the River:
*Abbotsford 12 ft Flying Squadron in Abbotsford
*Concord &amp; Ryde Sailing Club at Putney
*Parramatta River Sailing Club at Gladesville

Sailing and rowing take place under an aquatic licence granted annually by Roads and Maritime Services.

===Sea Scouts===
There are Sea Scouts at:
* Rhodes: First Yaralla
* Meadowbank: Epping Scout Group has a boat shed at 150 Bowden Street, next to the public ferry wharf, and in the summer uses it for sailing and canoeing activities

===Rowing===
The river has a long historical association with rowing. There is a monument in honour of Henry Searle, a champion sculler of his day, in the river at Henley.

Some of the school rowing sheds are:
* MLC School
* The King&#x27;s School
* Sydney Boys High School
* Newington College
* The Scots College
* Sydney Grammar School
* Shore School

There are also a number of rowing clubs:
* Leichhardt Rowing Club, Drummoyne Rowing Club and UTS Haberfield within Iron Cove.
* Glebe Rowing Club in Blackwattle Bay.
* Sydney Rowing Club at Abbotsford Point.
* Balmain Rowing Club at Balmain
* UNSW Boat Club in Tarban Creek.
* SGHS Rowing Club also in Tarban Creek

While a number of regattas are still held on the river each year, mainly in Iron Cove and Hen and Chicken Bay, many of the major regattas are now held at the Sydney International Regatta Centre (SIRC), adjacent to the Nepean River, where rowing was held for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Early GPS Schoolboy Head of the River races were held on the Parramatta River before moving to the Nepean River and later SIRC.

Most rowing training is done in the middle to upper reaches of the river between Abbotsford and Homebush Bay because there is less water traffic and therefore less waves and more protection from wind. Rowing also takes place in the Lane Cove River and Iron Cove which have less traffic.

===Foreshore walks and cycleways===
Much of the foreshore is still in the hands of industry and private individuals as residences, however there is an increasing amount of waterfront land available as foreshore reserve with walkways and cycleways. As former industrial sites undergo remediation and redevelopment, the foreshores are opened up for public access. Where there is no foreshore access, cycleways are routed through quiet residential streets with clearly marked sections of the road reserved for cyclists.

Major foreshore parks include:
* Cabarita Park
* Kissing Point Park, Ryde
* Meadowbank Park
* Putney Park
* George Kendall Riverside Park, Ermington
* Bicentennial Park, Homebush Bay
* Millennium Parklands, Homebush/Auburn

===Heritage items===

Major heritage buildings, all listed on the Register of the National Estate, on or near the foreshore include:
* Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital (now Rivendell Child, Adolescent and Family Unit), was designed by Sir John Sulman and built in 1891–93.
* Callan Park, a former psychiatric hospital, with fine sandstone buildings designed by James Barnet in 1877.
* Gladesville Mental Hospital, with sandstone buildings in park-like surroundings, designed by Mortimer Lewis in 1836.
* Yaralla, the Italianate mansion of Thomas Walker and his daughter Dame Eadith Walker, generous benefactors of the Concord community, now functions as Dame Eadith Walker Hospital. It was built in the late 1860s, with later extensions by Sir John Sulman.
* Newington House, a Regency home built in 1832 by John Blaxland. In 1863, the property was acquired by the Wesleyans and turned into Newington College. In 1887 it became part of Silverwater State Hospital, and later became an administrative block in Silverwater Correctional Complex.

<doc id="406896" wikidata="Q409415" url="?curid=406896" title="Airy function">
<text>In the physical sciences, the Airy function (or Airy function of the first kind) is a special function named after the British astronomer George Biddell Airy (1801–1892). The function Ai(&quot;x&quot;) and the related function Bi(&quot;x&quot;), are linearly independent solutions to the differential equation
formula_1
known as the Airy equation or the Stokes equation.

Because the solution of the linear differential equation
formula_2
is oscillatory for and exponential for , the Airy functions are oscillatory for and exponential for . In fact, the Airy equation is the simplest second-order linear differential equation with a turning point (a point where the character of the solutions changes from oscillatory to exponential).

==Definitions==

For real values of , the Airy function of the first kind can be defined by the improper Riemann integral:
formula_3
which converges by Dirichlet&#x27;s test. For any real number there is a positive real number such that function formula_4 is increasing, unbounded and convex with continuous and unbounded derivative on interval formula_5 The convergence of the integral on this interval can be proven by Dirichlet&#x27;s test after substitution formula_6

 satisfies the Airy equation
formula_7
This equation has two linearly independent solutions.
Up to scalar multiplication, is the solution subject to the condition as .
The standard choice for the other solution is the Airy function of the second kind, denoted Bi(&quot;x&quot;). It is defined as the solution with the same amplitude of oscillation as as which differs in phase by :

formula_8
==Properties==
The values of and and their derivatives at are given by
formula_9
Here, denotes the Gamma function. It follows that the Wronskian of and is .

When is positive, is positive, convex, and decreasing exponentially to zero, while is positive, convex, and increasing exponentially. When is negative, and oscillate around zero with ever-increasing frequency and ever-decreasing amplitude. This is supported by the asymptotic formulae below for the Airy functions.

The Airy functions are orthogonal in the sense that
formula_10
again using an improper Riemann integral.

;Real zeros of and its derivative 
Neither nor its derivative have positive real zeros. The &quot;first&quot; real zeros (i.e. nearest to x=0) are:
* &quot;first&quot; zeros of are at 
* &quot;first&quot; zeros of its derivative are at 

==Asymptotic formulae==
As explained below, the Airy functions can be extended to the complex plane, giving entire functions. The asymptotic behaviour of the Airy functions as goes to infinity at a constant value of depends on : this is called the Stokes phenomenon. For we have the following asymptotic formula for :

formula_11
orformula_12
where formula_13 In particular, the first few terms areformula_14
There is a similar one for , but only applicable when :

formula_15
A more accurate formula for and a formula for when or, equivalently, for and when but not zero, are:formula_16

When these are good approximations but are not asymptotic because the ratio between or and the above approximation goes to infinity whenever the sine or cosine goes to zero.
Asymptotic expansions for these limits are also available. These are listed in (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1983) and (Olver, 1974).

One is also able to obtain asymptotic expressions for the derivatives and . Similarly to before, when :

formula_17

When we have:

formula_18

Similarly, an expression for and when but not zero, are

formula_19

==Complex arguments==
We can extend the definition of the Airy function to the complex plane by
formula_20
where the integral is over a path &quot;C&quot; starting at the point at infinity with argument and ending at the point at infinity with argument π/3. Alternatively, we can use the differential equation to extend and to entire functions on the complex plane.

The asymptotic formula for is still valid in the complex plane if the principal value of is taken and is bounded away from the negative real axis. The formula for is valid provided is in the sector formula_21 for some positive δ. Finally, the formulae for and are valid if is in the sector formula_22

It follows from the asymptotic behaviour of the Airy functions that both and have an infinity of zeros on the negative real axis. The function has no other zeros in the complex plane, while the function also has infinitely many zeros in the sector formula_23

===Plots===

==Relation to other special functions==
For positive arguments, the Airy functions are related to the modified Bessel functions:
formula_24
Here, and are solutions of formula_25

The first derivative of the Airy function is
formula_26

Functions and can be represented in terms of rapidly convergent integrals (see also modified Bessel functions)

For negative arguments, the Airy function are related to the Bessel functions:
formula_27
Here, are solutions of
formula_28

The Scorer&#x27;s functions and solve the equation . They can also be expressed in terms of the Airy functions:
formula_29

==Fourier transform==
Using the definition of the Airy function Ai(&quot;x&quot;), it is straightforward to show that its Fourier transform is given by
formula_30This can be obtained by taking the Fourier transform of the Airy equation. Let formula_31. Then, formula_32, which then has solutions formula_33 There is only one dimension of solutions because the Fourier transform requires to decay to zero fast enough; grows to infinity exponentially fast, so it cannot be obtained via a Fourier transform.

==Applications==

=== Quantum mechanics ===
The Airy function is the solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle confined within a triangular potential well and for a particle in a one-dimensional constant force field. For the same reason, it also serves to provide uniform semiclassical approximations near a turning point in the WKB approximation, when the potential may be locally approximated by a linear function of position. The triangular potential well solution is directly relevant for the understanding of electrons trapped in semiconductor heterojunctions.

=== Optics ===

A transversally asymmetric optical beam, where the electric field profile is given by the Airy function, has the interesting property that its maximum intensity &quot;accelerates&quot; towards one side instead of propagating in a straight line as is the case in symmetric beams. This is at expense of the low-intensity tail being spread in the opposite direction, so the overall momentum of the beam is of course conserved.

=== Caustics ===

The Airy function underlies the form of the intensity near an optical directional caustic, such as that of the rainbow (called supernumerary rainbow). Historically, this was the mathematical problem that led Airy to develop this special function. In 1841, William Hallowes Miller experimentally measured the analog to supernumerary rainbow by shining light through a thin cylinder of water, then observing through a telescope. He observed up to 30 bands.

=== Probability ===

In the mid-1980s, the Airy function was found to be intimately connected to Chernoff&#x27;s distribution.

The Airy function also appears in the definition of Tracy–Widom distribution which describes the law of largest eigenvalues in Random matrix. Due to the intimate connection of random matrix theory with the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation, there are central processes constructed in KPZ such as the Airy process.

==History==
The Airy function is named after the British astronomer and physicist George Biddell Airy (1801–1892), who encountered it in his early study of optics in physics (Airy 1838). The notation Ai(&quot;x&quot;) was introduced by Harold Jeffreys. Airy had become the British Astronomer Royal in 1835, and he held that post until his retirement in 1881.

<doc id="406899" wikidata="Q823290" url="?curid=406899" title="Clausen function">
<text>In mathematics, the Clausen function, introduced by , is a transcendental, special function of a single variable. It can variously be expressed in the form of a definite integral, a trigonometric series, and various other forms. It is intimately connected with the polylogarithm, inverse tangent integral, polygamma function, Riemann zeta function, Dirichlet eta function, and Dirichlet beta function.

The Clausen function of order 2 – often referred to as &quot;the&quot; Clausen function, despite being but one of a class of many – is given by the integral:

:formula_1

In the range formula_2 the sine function inside the absolute value sign remains strictly positive, so the absolute value signs may be omitted. The Clausen function also has the Fourier series representation:

:formula_3

The Clausen functions, as a class of functions, feature extensively in many areas of modern mathematical research, particularly in relation to the evaluation of many classes of logarithmic and polylogarithmic integrals, both definite and indefinite. They also have numerous applications with regard to the summation of hypergeometric series, summations involving the inverse of the central binomial coefficient, sums of the polygamma function, and Dirichlet L-series.

==Basic properties==

The Clausen function (of order 2) has simple zeros at all (integer) multiples of formula_4 since if formula_5 is an integer, then formula_6

:formula_7

It has maxima at formula_8

:formula_9

and minima at formula_10

:formula_11

The following properties are immediate consequences of the series definition:

:formula_12
:formula_13

See .

==General definition==
More generally, one defines the two generalized Clausen functions:

:formula_14
:formula_15

which are valid for complex &quot;z&quot; with Re &quot;z&quot; &gt;1. The definition may be extended to all of the complex plane through analytic continuation.

When &quot;z&quot; is replaced with a non-negative integer, the standard Clausen functions are defined by the following Fourier series:

:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18
:formula_19

N.B. The SL-type Clausen functions have the alternative notation formula_20 and are sometimes referred to as the Glaisher–Clausen functions (after James Whitbread Lee Glaisher, hence the GL-notation).

==Relation to the Bernoulli polynomials==

The SL-type Clausen function are polynomials in formula_21, and are closely related to the Bernoulli polynomials. This connection is apparent from the Fourier series representations of the Bernoulli polynomials:

:formula_22
:formula_23

Setting formula_24 in the above, and then rearranging the terms gives the following closed form (polynomial) expressions:

:formula_25
:formula_26

where the Bernoulli polynomials formula_27 are defined in terms of the Bernoulli numbers formula_28 by the relation:

:formula_29

Explicit evaluations derived from the above include:

:formula_30
:formula_31
:formula_32
:formula_33

==Duplication formula==

For formula_34, the duplication formula can be proven directly from the integral definition (see also for the result – although no proof is given):

:formula_35

Denoting Catalan&#x27;s constant by formula_36, immediate consequences of the duplication formula include the relations:

:formula_37
:formula_38

For higher order Clausen functions, duplication formulae can be obtained from the one given above; simply replace formula_39 with the dummy variable formula_40, and integrate over the interval formula_41 Applying the same process repeatedly yields:

:formula_42
:formula_43
:formula_44
:formula_45

And more generally, upon induction on formula_46

:formula_47

Use of the generalized duplication formula allows for an extension of the result for the Clausen function of order 2, involving Catalan&#x27;s constant. For formula_48

:formula_49

Where formula_50 is the Dirichlet beta function.

===Proof of the duplication formula===

From the integral definition,

:formula_51

Apply the duplication formula for the sine function, formula_52 to obtain

:formula_53

Apply the substitution formula_54 on both integrals:

:formula_55

On that last integral, set formula_56, and use the trigonometric identity formula_57 to show that:

: formula_58

: formula_59

Therefore,

: formula_60

==Derivatives of general-order Clausen functions==

Direct differentiation of the Fourier series expansions for the Clausen functions give:

:formula_61
:formula_62
:formula_63
:formula_64

By appealing to the First Fundamental Theorem Of Calculus, we also have:

:formula_65

==Relation to the inverse tangent integral==

The inverse tangent integral is defined on the interval formula_66 by

:formula_67

It has the following closed form in terms of the Clausen function:

:formula_68

===Proof of the inverse tangent integral relation===

From the integral definition of the inverse tangent integral, we have

:formula_69

Performing an integration by parts

:formula_70
:formula_71

Apply the substitution formula_72 to obtain

:formula_73

For that last integral, apply the transform :formula_74 to get

:formula_75

Finally, as with the proof of the Duplication formula, the substitution formula_76 reduces that last integral to

:formula_77

Thus

:formula_78

==Relation to the Barnes&#x27; G-function==

For real formula_66, the Clausen function of second order can be expressed in terms of the Barnes G-function and (Euler) Gamma function:

:formula_80

Or equivalently

:formula_81

See .

==Relation to the polylogarithm==

The Clausen functions represent the real and imaginary parts of the polylogarithm, on the unit circle:

:formula_82
:formula_83

This is easily seen by appealing to the series definition of the polylogarithm.

:formula_84

By Euler&#x27;s theorem,

:formula_85

and by de Moivre&#x27;s Theorem (De Moivre&#x27;s formula)

:formula_86

Hence

:formula_87
:formula_88

==Relation to the polygamma function==

The Clausen functions are intimately connected to the polygamma function. Indeed, it is possible to express Clausen functions as linear combinations of sine functions and polygamma functions. One such relation is shown here, and proven below:

:formula_89

An immediate corollary is this equivalent formula in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function:

:formula_90
Let formula_91 and formula_92 be positive integers, such that formula_93 is a rational number formula_94, then, by the series definition for the higher order Clausen function (of even index):

:formula_95

We split this sum into exactly p-parts, so that the first series contains all, and only, those terms congruent to formula_96 the second series contains all terms congruent to formula_97 etc., up to the final p-th part, that contain all terms congruent to formula_98

:formula_99

We can index these sums to form a double sum:

:formula_100

Applying the addition formula for the sine function, formula_101 the sine term in the numerator becomes:

:formula_102
:formula_103
:formula_104

Consequently,

:formula_105

To convert the inner sum in the double sum into a non-alternating sum, split in two in parts in exactly the same way as the earlier sum was split into p-parts:

:formula_106

For formula_107, the polygamma function has the series representation

:formula_108

So, in terms of the polygamma function, the previous inner sum becomes:

: formula_109

Plugging this back into the double sum gives the desired result:

:formula_110

==Relation to the generalized logsine integral==

The generalized logsine integral is defined by:

:formula_111

In this generalized notation, the Clausen function can be expressed in the form:

:formula_112

==Kummer&#x27;s relation==

Ernst Kummer and Rogers give the relation

:formula_113

valid for formula_114.

==Relation to the Lobachevsky function==

The Lobachevsky function Λ or Л is essentially the same function with a change of variable:

:formula_115

though the name &quot;Lobachevsky function&quot; is not quite historically accurate, as Lobachevsky&#x27;s formulas for hyperbolic volume used the slightly different function

:formula_116

==Relation to Dirichlet L-functions==
For rational values of formula_117 (that is, for formula_118 for some integers &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;), the function formula_119 can be understood to represent a periodic orbit of an element in the cyclic group, and thus formula_120 can be expressed as a simple sum involving the Hurwitz zeta function. This allows relations between certain Dirichlet L-functions to be easily computed.

==Series acceleration==
A series acceleration for the Clausen function is given by

:formula_121

which holds for formula_122. Here, formula_123 is the Riemann zeta function. A more rapidly convergent form is given by

:formula_124

Convergence is aided by the fact that formula_125 approaches zero rapidly for large values of &quot;n&quot;. Both forms are obtainable through the types of resummation techniques used to obtain rational zeta series .

==Special values==

Recall the Barnes G-function, the Catalan&#x27;s constant &quot;K&quot; and the Gieseking constant &quot;V&quot;. Some special values include

:formula_126
:formula_127
:formula_128
:formula_129
:formula_130
:formula_131
:formula_132
:formula_133

In general, from the Barnes G-function reflection formula,

:formula_134

Equivalently, using Euler&#x27;s reflection formula for the gamma function, then,

:formula_135

==Generalized special values==

Some special values for higher order Clausen functions include

:formula_136
:formula_137
:formula_138
:formula_139
:formula_140

where formula_141 is the Dirichlet beta function, formula_142 is the Dirichlet eta function (also called the alternating zeta function), and formula_143 is the Riemann zeta function.

==Integrals of the direct function==

The following integrals are easily proven from the series representations of the Clausen function:

:formula_144
:formula_145
:formula_146
:formula_147

Fourier-analytic methods can be used to find the first moments of the square of the function formula_148 on the interval formula_149:

:formula_150
:formula_151
:formula_152

Here formula_153 denotes the multiple zeta function.

==Integral evaluations involving the direct function==

A large number of trigonometric and logarithmo-trigonometric integrals can be evaluated in terms of the Clausen function, and various common mathematical constants like formula_154 (Catalan&#x27;s constant), formula_155, and the special cases of the zeta function, formula_156 and formula_157.

The examples listed below follow directly from the integral representation of the Clausen function, and the proofs require little more than basic trigonometry, integration by parts, and occasional term-by-term integration of the Fourier series definitions of the Clausen functions.

:formula_158
:formula_159
:formula_160
:formula_161
:formula_162
:formula_163
:formula_164

<doc id="406902" wikidata="Q601195" url="?curid=406902" title="Geometrized unit system">
<text>A geometrized unit system or geometrodynamic unit system is a system of natural units in which the base physical units are chosen so that the speed of light in vacuum, &quot;c&quot;, and the gravitational constant, &quot;G&quot;, are set equal to unity.

:formula_1
:formula_2

The geometrized unit system is not a completely defined system. Some systems are geometrized unit systems in the sense that they set these, in addition to other constants, to unity, for example Stoney units and Planck units.

This system is useful in physics, especially in the special and general theories of relativity. All physical quantities are identified with geometric quantities such as areas, lengths, dimensionless numbers, path curvatures, or sectional curvatures.

Many equations in relativistic physics appear simpler when expressed in geometric units, because all occurrences of &quot;G&quot; and of &quot;c&quot; drop out. For example, the Schwarzschild radius of a nonrotating uncharged black hole with mass &quot;m&quot; becomes . For this reason, many books and papers on relativistic physics use geometric units. An alternative system of geometrized units is often used in particle physics and cosmology, in which instead. This introduces an additional factor of 8π into Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation but simplifies the Einstein field equations, the Einstein–Hilbert action, the Friedmann equations and the Newtonian Poisson equation by removing the corresponding factor.

==Definition==
Geometrized units were defined in the book &quot;Gravitation&quot; by Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne, and John Archibald Wheeler with the speed of light, formula_3, the gravitational constant, formula_4, and Boltzmann constant, formula_5 all set to formula_6. Some authors refer to these units as geometrodynamic units.

In geometric units, every time interval is interpreted as the distance travelled by light during that given time interval. That is, one second is interpreted as one light-second, so time has the geometric units of length. This is dimensionally consistent with the notion that, according to the kinematical laws of special relativity, time and distance are on an equal footing.

Energy and momentum are interpreted as components of the four-momentum vector, and mass is the magnitude of this vector, so in geometric units these must all have the dimension of length. We can convert a mass expressed in kilograms to the equivalent mass expressed in metres by multiplying by the conversion factor &quot;G&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2. For example, the Sun&#x27;s mass of in SI units is equivalent to . This is half the Schwarzschild radius of a one solar mass black hole. All other conversion factors can be worked out by combining these two.

The small numerical size of the few conversion factors reflects the fact that relativistic effects are only noticeable when large masses or high speeds are considered.

==Conversions==

Listed below are all conversion factors that are useful to convert between all combinations of the SI base units, and if not possible, between them and their unique elements, because ampere is a dimensionless ratio of two lengths such as [C/s], and candela (1/683 [W/sr]) is a dimensionless ratio of two dimensionless ratios such as ratio of two volumes [kg⋅m2/s3] = [W] and ratio of two areas [m2/m2] = [sr], while mole is only a dimensionless Avogadro number of entities such as atoms or particles. The vacuum permittivity and Boltzmann constant are &quot;ε&quot;0 and &quot;k&quot;B.

<text>In mathematics, the Dawson function or Dawson integral
(named after H. G. Dawson) 
is the one-sided Fourier–Laplace sine transform of the Gaussian function.

==Definition==

The Dawson function is defined as either:
formula_1
also denoted as formula_2 or formula_3
or alternatively
formula_4

The Dawson function is the one-sided Fourier–Laplace sine transform of the Gaussian function,
formula_5

It is closely related to the error function erf, as
:formula_6
where erfi is the imaginary error function, 
&lt;br&gt;
Similarly,
formula_7
in terms of the real error function, erf.

In terms of either erfi or the Faddeeva function formula_8 the Dawson function can be extended to the entire complex plane:
formula_9
which simplifies to
formula_10
formula_11
for real formula_12

For formula_13 near zero, 
For formula_13 large, 
More specifically, near the origin it has the series expansion
formula_15
while for large formula_16 it has the asymptotic expansion
formula_17

More precisely 
formula_18
where formula_19 is the double factorial. 

formula_2 satisfies the differential equation
formula_21
with the initial condition formula_22 Consequently, it has extrema for
formula_23
resulting in &quot;x&quot; = ±0.92413887... (), &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = ±0.54104422... ().

Inflection points follow for
formula_24
resulting in &quot;x&quot; = ±1.50197526... (), &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = ±0.42768661... ().
(Apart from the trivial inflection point at formula_25 formula_26)

==Relation to Hilbert transform of Gaussian==

The Hilbert transform of the Gaussian is defined as
formula_27

P.V. denotes the Cauchy principal value, and we restrict ourselves to real formula_28 formula_29 can be related to the Dawson function as follows. Inside a principal value integral, we can treat formula_30 as a generalized function or distribution, and use the Fourier representation
formula_31

With formula_32 we use the exponential representation of formula_33 and complete the square with respect to formula_16 to find
formula_35

We can shift the integral over formula_16 to the real axis, and it gives formula_37
Thus
formula_38

We complete the square with respect to formula_39 and obtain
formula_40

We change variables to formula_41
formula_42

The integral can be performed as a contour integral around a rectangle in the complex plane. Taking the imaginary part of the result gives
formula_43
where formula_44 is the Dawson function as defined above.

The Hilbert transform of formula_45 is also related to the Dawson function. We see this with the technique of differentiating inside the integral sign. Let
formula_46

Introduce
formula_47

The formula_48th derivative is
formula_49

We thus find
formula_50

The derivatives are performed first, then the result evaluated at formula_51 A change of variable also gives formula_52 Since formula_53 we can write formula_54 where formula_55 and formula_56 are polynomials. For example, formula_57 Alternatively, formula_58 can be calculated using the recurrence relation (for formula_59)
formula_60

<doc id="406910" wikidata="Q558986" url="?curid=406910" title="Yagan">
<text>Yagan (;  – 11 July 1833) was an Aboriginal Australian warrior from the Noongar people. Yagan was pursued by the local authorities after he killed Erin Entwhistle, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler. It was an act of retaliation after Thomas Smedley, another of Butler&#x27;s servants, shot at a group of Noongar people stealing potatoes and fowls, killing one of them. The government offered a bounty for Yagan&#x27;s capture, dead or alive, and a young settler, William Keats, shot and killed him. Yagan is considered a legendary figure by the Noongar.

After his shooting, settlers cut off Yagan&#x27;s head to claim the bounty. Later, an official sent it to London, where it was exhibited as an &quot;anthropological curiosity&quot; and eventually given to a museum in Liverpool. It held the head in storage for more than a century before burying it with other remains in an unmarked grave in Liverpool in 1964. Over the years, the Noongar asked for repatriation of the head, both for religious reasons and because of Yagan&#x27;s traditional stature. The burial site was identified in 1993; officials exhumed the head four years later and repatriated it to Australia. After years of debate within the Noongar community on the appropriate final resting place, Yagan&#x27;s head was buried in a traditional ceremony in the Swan Valley in July 2010, 177 years after his death.

==Biography==
===Early life===
A member of the Whadjuk Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a tribe of around 60 people whose name, according to Robert Lyon, was &quot;Beeliar&quot;. Scholars now believe that the Beeliar people may have been a family subgroup (or clan) of a larger tribe whom Daisy Bates called &quot;Beelgar&quot;. According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the Swan and Canning rivers, as far south as Mangles Bay. The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as Lake Monger and northeast to the Helena River. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours&#x27; land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups.

Yagan is thought to have been born around 1795. His father was Midgegooroo, an elder of the Beeliar people; his mother was one of Midgegooroo&#x27;s three wives. Yagan was probably a in the Noongar classification.

===Marriage and family===
According to the historian Neville Green, Yagan had a wife and two children. A report in the &quot;Perth Gazette&quot; in 1833 gives the names of his children as &quot;Naral&quot;, age 9, and &quot;Willim&quot;, age 11, but most other sources state that the warrior was unmarried and childless. When his entry in the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; was rewritten in 2019, Reece suggested those said to have been his sons may have been his younger brothers. Described as taller than average with an impressive burly physique, Yagan had a distinctive tribal tattoo on his right shoulder, which identified him as &quot;a man of high degree in tribal law&quot;. He was generally acknowledged to be the most physically powerful of his tribe, and was said to have been able to spear another stick from a distance of or penetrate a tree from a distance of .

===Relations with settlers===
Yagan would have been about 35 years old in 1829 when British settlers landed in the area and established the Swan River Colony. For the first two years of the colony, relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable, as there was little competition for resources. The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as , the returned spirits of their dead. Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish. As time passed, conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent. The settlers thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed. Colonists fenced off land for grazing and farming according to their traditional practices of land use.

As the colonists fenced off more land, the Noongar were increasingly denied access to their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers&#x27; crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers&#x27; supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming, or lighting the bush to flush out game threatened the settlers&#x27; crops and houses.

In December 1831 Yagan and his father led the first significant Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia. Thomas Smedley, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler, apprehended some natives who were raiding a potato patch, and killed one of Yagan&#x27;s family group. A few days later, Yagan, Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and, finding the door locked, began to break through the mud-brick walls. Inside were Butler&#x27;s servant Erin Entwhistle and his two sons Enion and Ralph. After hiding his sons under the bed, Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was killed by Yagan and Midgegooroo. Noongar tribal law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer&#x27;s tribal group, not necessarily the murderer. The Noongar considered servants and employees to be part of the settlers&#x27; groups. Historians believe the Noongar attack on Entwhistle was retribution under their tribal law. Not understanding tribal law (and unlikely to agree with its concepts if they had), the white settlers took the killing to be an unprovoked murder and dispatched a force to arrest Yagan&#x27;s group, without success.

In June 1832 Yagan led a party of Noongar in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat alongside the Canning River near Kelmscott. One of the men, John Thomas, escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died as a result. The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw and offered a reward of £20, equivalent to roughly in , for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water. The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the Round House at Fremantle. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler Robert Lyon. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan should not be considered a criminal but a prisoner of war and suggested he should be treated as such. At the recommendation of John Septimus Roe, the Surveyor-General of Western Australia, Yagan and his men were exiled on Carnac Island under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.

Lyon thought he could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his cooperation and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs. After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended dinghy and rowing to Woodman Point on the mainland. The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.

In January 1833 two Noongar, Gyallipert and Manyat, visited Perth from King George Sound, where relations between settlers and natives were amicable. Two settlers, Richard Dale and George Smythe, arranged for the men to meet a party of local Noongar to encourage friendly relations in the Swan River Colony. On 26 January Yagan led a group of ten formally armed Noongars in greeting the two men near Lake Monger. The men exchanged weapons and held a &quot;corroboree&quot;, though the groups did not appear to share a language. Yagan and Gyallipert competed at spear throwing. As an example of his prowess, Yagan struck a walking stick from a distance of .

Gyallipert and Manyat remained in Perth for some time. On 3 March, Yagan obtained permission to hold another corroboree, this time in the post office garden in Perth. The Perth and King George Sound men met at dusk, chalked their bodies, and performed a number of dances including a kangaroo hunt dance. &quot;The Perth Gazette&quot; wrote that Yagan &quot;was master of ceremonies and acquitted himself with infinite grace and dignity&quot;.

During February and March, Yagan was involved in a series of minor conflicts with settlers. In February William Watson complained that Yagan had pushed open his door, demanded a gun, and taken handkerchiefs. Watson had to give him and his companions flour and bread. The following month, Yagan was among a group who received biscuits from a military contingent under Lieutenant Norcott; when Norcott tried to restrict his supply, Yagan threatened him with his spear. Later that month, Yagan was with a group of Noongar who entered Watson&#x27;s house while he was away. The group left after Watson&#x27;s wife called on neighbours for help. The next day Captain Ellis lectured the Noongar about their behaviour. The frequent incidents prompted &quot;The Perth Gazette&quot; to remark on &quot;the reckless daring of this desperado who sets his life at a pin&#x27;s fee ... For the most trivial offence  ... he would take the life of any man who provoked him. He is at the head and front of any mischief.&quot;

===Wanted dead or alive===
On the night of 29 April, a party of Noongar broke into a Fremantle store to steal flour and they were shot at by the caretaker Peter Chidlow. Domjum, a brother of Yagan, was badly injured and died in jail a few days later. The rest of the party moved from Fremantle to Preston Point, where Yagan reportedly vowed vengeance for the death. Between 50 and 60 Noongar gathered at Bull Creek, where they met a party of settlers who were loading carts with provisions. Later that day, the group ambushed the lead cart, killing two settlers, Tom and John Velvick. Tribal law required only a single death for vengeance. Some historians have speculated that the Velvicks were targeted because they had previously been convicted for assaulting Aboriginal people and coloured seamen. Alexandra Hasluck has also argued that stealing provisions was an important motive in the attack, but this has been refuted elsewhere.

For the killing of the Velvicks, the Lieutenant-Governor Frederick Irwin declared Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws, offering rewards of £20 each for the capture of Midgegooroo and Munday, and a reward of £30 for Yagan&#x27;s capture, dead or alive. Munday successfully appealed against his proscription. Midgegooroo, Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley. On 17 May, Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River, and executed by firing squad on 22 May. There was no trial, even in the sense of an informal hearing. Midgegooroo was clearly not allowed the opportunity to give evidence or defend himself and indeed it is probable that he did not understand what was being alleged.

Yagan remained at large for over two months. Late in May, George Fletcher Moore reported seeing Yagan on his property and talking with him in pidgin English. Moore wrote in the &quot;Perth Gazette&quot;:
Yagan asked Moore whether Midgegooroo was dead or alive. Moore gave no reply, but a servant answered that Midgegooroo was a prisoner on Carnac Island. Yagan warned, &quot;White man shoot Midgegooroo, Yagan kill three.&quot; Moore reported the encounter but made no attempt to restrain Yagan. He later wrote, &quot;The truth is, every one wishes him taken, but no one likes to be the captor... there is something in his daring which one is forced to admire.&quot;

===Death===

On 11 July 1833, two teenage brothers named William and James Keates were herding cattle along the Swan River north of Guildford when a group of Noongar approached while en route to collect flour rations from Henry Bull&#x27;s house. The Keates brothers suggested Yagan remain with them to avoid arrest. While he was staying with them during the morning, the brothers decided to kill the warrior and claim the reward. When the natives were ready to depart, the Keateses took their last opportunity. William Keates shot Yagan, and James shot Heegan, another native, in the act of throwing his spear. The brothers ran away, but other Noongar overtook William and speared him to death. James escaped by swimming the river. Shortly afterward he returned with a party of armed settlers from Bull&#x27;s estate.

When the party of settlers arrived, they found Yagan dead and Heegan dying. Heegan &quot;was groaning and his brains were partly out when the party came, and whether humanity or brutality, a man put a gun to his head and blew it to pieces.&quot; The settlers cut Yagan&#x27;s head from his body, and skinned his back to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy. They buried the bodies a short distance away.

James Keates claimed the reward, but his conduct was widely criticised. &quot;The Perth Gazette&quot; referred to Yagan&#x27;s killing as &quot;a wild and treacherous act ... it is revolting to hear this lauded as a meritorious deed.&quot; However, Daisy Bates posits that &quot;he was killed in self-defence by the young lad.&quot; Keates left the colony the following month, possibly from fear of being murdered in tribal retaliation.

==Yagan&#x27;s head==

===Exhibition and burial===

Yagan&#x27;s head was initially taken to Henry Bull&#x27;s house. Moore saw it there and sketched the head a number of times in his unpublished, handwritten diary, commenting that &quot;possibly it may yet figure in some museum at home.&quot; The head was preserved by smoking.

In September 1833, Governor Irwin sailed for London, partly to give his own account of the events leading up to the killing. This was an unusual measure, especially given his regiment was about to leave for a tour of duty in India. The Colonial Office indicated satisfaction with Irwin&#x27;s administration of the colony.

Travelling with Irwin was Ensign Robert Dale, who had somehow acquired Yagan&#x27;s head. According to the historian Paul Turnbull, Dale appears to have persuaded Irwin to let him have the head as an &quot;anthropological curiosity&quot;. After arriving in London, Dale tried to sell the head to scientists, approaching a number of anatomists and phrenologists. His price of £20 failed to find a buyer, so he made an agreement with Thomas Pettigrew for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months. Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian, was well known in the London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and autopsied ancient Egyptian mummies. He displayed the head on a table in front of a panoramic view of King George Sound reproduced from Dale&#x27;s sketches. For effect, the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the red-tailed black cockatoo.
Pettigrew had the head examined by a phrenologist. Examination was considered difficult because of the large fracture across the back of the head caused by the gunshot. His conclusions were consistent with contemporary European opinion of Indigenous Australians. Dale published these in a pamphlet entitled &quot;Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View &amp;c. of King George&#x27;s Sound and the Adjacent Country&quot;, which Pettigrew encouraged his guests to buy as a souvenir of their evening. The frontispiece of the pamphlet was a hand-coloured aquatint print of Yagan&#x27;s head by the artist George Cruikshank.

Early in October 1835, Yagan&#x27;s head and the panoramic view were returned to Dale, then living in Liverpool. On 12 October he presented them to the Liverpool Royal Institution, where the head may have been displayed in a case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy. In 1894 the Institution&#x27;s collections were dispersed, and Yagan&#x27;s head was lent to the Liverpool Museum; it is thought not to have been put on display there. By the 1960s Yagan&#x27;s head was badly deteriorated. In April 1964 the museum decided to dispose of it. It arranged burial of the head on 10 April 1964, together with a Peruvian mummy and a Māori head. They were buried in Everton Cemetery&#x27;s General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years a number of burials were made around the grave. For example, in 1968 a local hospital buried directly over the box, 20 stillborn babies and two infants who died soon after birth.

===Lobbying for repatriation===
For many years beginning in the early 1980s, a number of Noongar groups sought the return of Yagan&#x27;s head to Australia.
At the time, there was no historical trail for the head after Pettigrew passed it on. Tribal elders entrusted the Aboriginal leader Ken Colbung with the search. In the early 1990s, Colbung enlisted the aid of University of London archaeologist Peter Ucko. One of Ucko&#x27;s researchers, Cressida Fforde, conducted a literature search for information on the head. Fforde successfully traced the head in December 1993. The following April, Colbung applied to exhume the remains under Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857. Home Office regulations required next of kin consent before disturbing the remains of the 22 infants. Colbung&#x27;s solicitors requested waiver of this condition on grounds that the exhumation would be of great personal significance to Yagan&#x27;s living relatives, and great national importance to Australia.

Meanwhile, divisions in the Noongar community in Perth began to develop. Some elders questioned Colbung&#x27;s role and one Noongar registered a complaint with the Liverpool City Council over his involvement. Media reports indicated acrimonious debate within the Noongar community about who had the best cultural qualifications to take possession of the head. The academic Hannah McGlade claims that these divisions were largely manufactured by the media, particularly &quot;The West Australian&quot;, which &quot;aimed to and successfully represented the Nyungar community in terms of disharmony and dissent&quot;. She alleges that one &quot;West&quot; reporter contacted Noongar who were known to be in disagreement, and quoted one to the other, so as to elicit provocative responses. The disputes were &quot;trumpeted&quot; by &quot;The West&quot;, allowing it to &quot;preach&quot; against the infighting.

On 25 July a public meeting was held in Perth. All parties agreed to put aside their differences and co-operate to ensure that the repatriation was a &quot;national success&quot;. A Yagan Steering Committee was established to co-ordinate the repatriation, and Colbung&#x27;s application was allowed to proceed. In January 1995 the Home Office advised Colbung that it was unable to waive the requirement to obtain next of kin consent for the exhumation. It contacted the five relatives whose addresses were known, and received unconditional consent from only one. Accordingly, on 30 June 1995, Colbung and the other interested parties were advised that the application for exhumation had been rejected.

Meeting on 21 September, the Yagan Steering Committee decided to lobby Australian and British politicians for support. In 1997 Colbung was invited to visit the United Kingdom at the British government&#x27;s expense and he arrived on 20 May. His visit attracted substantial media coverage, and increased the political pressure on the British Government. He secured the support of the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, after gate crashing the Prime Minister&#x27;s June visit to the United Kingdom.

===Exhumation===
While Colbung was in the United Kingdom, Martin and Richard Bates were engaged to undertake a geophysical survey of the grave site. Using electromagnetic and ground penetrating radar techniques, they identified an approximate position of the box that suggested it could be accessed from the side via the adjacent plot. A report of the survey was passed to the Home Office, prompting further discussions between the British and Australian Governments.

Of concern to the Home Office were an undisclosed number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung&#x27;s involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant. In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to tell the British Home Office that he was the correct applicant. ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung&#x27;s application could proceed.

Colbung continued to press for the exhumation, asking that it be performed before the 164th anniversary of Yagan&#x27;s death on 11 July, so that the anniversary could be the occasion of a celebration. His request was not met, and on the anniversary of Yagan&#x27;s death, Colbung conducted a short memorial service at the burial plot in Everton. He returned to Australia empty-handed on 15 July.

The exhumation of Yagan&#x27;s head eventually proceeded, without Colbung&#x27;s knowledge, by excavating down the side of the grave, then tunnelling horizontally to the location of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan&#x27;s by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew&#x27;s report. The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.

===Repatriation===
On 27 August 1997, a delegation of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, Robert Bropho, Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan&#x27;s head. The delegation was to have been larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute. The handover of Yagan&#x27;s skull was further delayed when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan&#x27;s remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head&#x27;s exhumation and removal to Australia. On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney&#x27;s claim to sole responsibility.

Yagan&#x27;s skull was handed over to the Noongar delegation at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997. In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan&#x27;s death with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, earlier that day: That is how nature goes ... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung&#x27;s comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.

Throughout the repatriation process, many sections of the international media treated the story as a joke. For example, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ran a story under the headline &quot;Raiders of the Lost Conk&quot;, in which Yagan&#x27;s head was referred to as a &quot;pickled curio&quot;, and Colbung&#x27;s actions were treated as a publicity stunt.

===Preparations for reburial===
On its return to Perth, Yagan&#x27;s head continued to be a source of controversy and conflict. Responsibility for reburial of the head was given to a &quot;Committee for the Reburial of Yagan&#x27;s Kaat&quot;, headed by Richard Wilkes. The reburial was delayed by disputes between elders over the burial location, mainly due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body, and disagreement about the importance of burying the head with the body.

A number of attempts were made to locate the remains of Yagan&#x27;s body, which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus. A remote sensing survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the remains.

In 1998 the Western Australian Planning Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs jointly published a document entitled &quot;Yagan&#x27;s Gravesite Master Plan&quot;, which discussed &quot;matters of ownership, management, development and future use&quot; of the property on which Yagan&#x27;s remains are believed to be buried. Under consideration was the possibility of turning the site into an Indigenous burial site, to be managed by the Metropolitan Cemeteries Board.

Yagan&#x27;s head spent some time in storage in a bank vault before being handed over to forensics experts who reconstructed a model from it. After that it was held in storage at Western Australia&#x27;s state mortuary. Plans to re-bury the head were repeatedly deferred, causing ongoing conflict between Noongar groups. In September 2008 it was reported that Yagan&#x27;s head would be reburied in November, and a Yagan Memorial Park created as a projected cost of A$996,000; but in November it was announced that the reburial had been rescheduled for July 2009 because of logistical problems. In March 2009, it was announced that the Department of Indigenous Affairs had given the City of Swan more than A$500,000 to develop the park.

===Reburial===
The head was finally buried in a private ceremony attended only by invited Noongar elders, on 10 July 2010, the anniversary of the last full day he lived and one day before the end of NAIDOC Week 2010. The site in Belhus was chosen as it is believed to be near to where the rest of Yagan&#x27;s body was buried. The burial coincided with a ceremony to mark the opening of the Yagan Memorial Park, which was attended by around 300 people, including Noongar elders and state government representatives. Premier Colin Barnett described the occasion as &quot;a wonderful day for all West Australians&quot;.

The art works for the Yagan Memorial Park were designed by Peter Farmer, Sandra Hill, Jenny Dawson and Kylie Ricks. Dawson and Hill created an entry wall of Yagan&#x27;s story; Farmer designed the park entry statements and Ricks the female coolamon.

==Legacy==
In the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot;, Reece wrote that Yagan &quot;was not the brutal, indiscriminate killer most settlers thought him to be&quot;, but sought to enforce the Noongar system of retributive justice &quot;as the only basis for a resolution of conflict between Noongars and colonists&quot;. Yagan was a lone actor in this regard:

The repatriation of Yagan&#x27;s head increased the Aboriginal leader&#x27;s notability. He is considered a famous historical figure throughout Australia, with material about him appearing in such publications as the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot;, and Western Australia&#x27;s school curriculum. He is of greatest significance to the Noongar people, for whom he is &quot;a revered, cherished and heroic individual ... patriot and visionary hero of WA&#x27;s South-West&quot;. The return of his head was likened by some Indigenous Australians to the November 1993 ceremonial repatriation from Gallipoli of Australia&#x27;s unknown soldier.

The former Upper Swan Bridge, which carries the Great Northern Highway over the Swan River at Belhus, was renamed the &quot;Yagan Bridge&quot; in 2010. 

An open plaza in the Perth central business district, constructed as part of the Perth City Link urban renewal project, was named Yagan Square. Featuring the statue &quot;Wirin&quot;, the plaza, located adjacent to the Horseshoe Bridge, was opened on 3 March 2018.

===&quot;Alas Poor Yagan&quot;===

On 6 September 1997 &quot;The West Australian&quot; published a Dean Alston cartoon entitled &quot;Alas Poor Yagan&quot;, which was critical of the fact that the return of Yagan&#x27;s head had become a source of conflict between Noongars instead of fostering unity. The cartoon was interpreted by some as insulting aspects of Noongar culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage. The content of the cartoon offended many Indigenous Australians, and a group of Noongar elders complained about the cartoon to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The commission ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Noongar beliefs but was not in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 because it was &quot;an artistic work&quot; that was published &quot;reasonably and in good faith&quot;, and was therefore exempt. This ruling was upheld on appeal by the Federal Court of Australia. Some academic commentators have since expressed concern that the protections offered under the act have been undermined by the ruling&#x27;s broad interpretation of the exemptions.

===Statue===
From the mid-1970s, members of the Noongar community lobbied for the erection of a statue of Yagan as part of the WAY 1979 sesquicentennial celebrations. Their requests were refused, however, after the Premier, Charles Court, was advised by one prominent historian that Yagan was not important enough to warrant a statue. Colbung claims &quot;Court was more interested in spending tax payers&#x27; money on refurbishing the badly neglected burial place of Captain James Stirling, WA&#x27;s first governor.&quot; Despite this setback, the Noongar community persisted, establishing a Yagan Committee and running a number of fund-raising drives. Eventually, sufficient funds were collected to allow the commissioning of Australian sculptor Robert Hitchcock to create a statue. The result was a life-size statue in bronze, depicting Yagan standing naked with a spear held across his shoulders. Hitchcock&#x27;s statue of Yagan was officially opened by Yagan Committee chairperson Elizabeth Hanson on 11 September 1984. It stands on Heirisson Island in the Swan River near Perth.

In 1997, within a week of the return of Yagan&#x27;s head to Perth, vandals beheaded the statue using an angle grinder. Soon after a replacement head was installed and it too was detached and stolen. Credit for the act was anonymously claimed by a &quot;British loyalist&quot; as an act of retaliation for Colbung&#x27;s comments about Diana, Princess of Wales. The Western Australia Police did not succeed in identifying the vandals, nor in recovering the heads, and deemed it infeasible to have the statue fenced off or placed under guard.

Commentary on the beheadings varied widely. One column in &quot;The West Australian&quot; found humour in them, referring to the head as a &quot;bonce&quot; and a &quot;noggin&quot;, and finished with a pun on &quot;skullduggery&quot;. Stephen Muecke calls this the &quot;satirical trivialising of Aboriginal concerns&quot;, and Adam Shoemaker writes &quot;This is the stuff of light humour and comic relief. There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism, even less that it could have been motivated by malevolence ... [T]he piece has a definite authorising function.&quot; On the other hand, academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity. In 2007, for example, David Martin described the decapitation as &quot;an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism, but also to the power of to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own&quot;.

In 2002, Janet Woollard, the member for Alfred Cove, called for the statue&#x27;s genitalia to be covered up. In November 2005, Richard Wilkes also called for the statue&#x27;s groin to be covered on the grounds that such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is the creation of a new statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan&#x27;s head.

===Literature and film===

Mary Durack published a fictionalised account of Yagan&#x27;s life in her 1964 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Courteous Savage: Yagan of the Swan River&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Yagan of the Bibbulmun&quot; on reissue in 1976.

The repeated beheading of Yagan&#x27;s statue in 1997 prompted Aboriginal writer Archie Weller to write a short story entitled &quot;Confessions of a Headhunter&quot;. Weller later worked with film director Sally Riley to adapt the story into a script, and in 2000 a 35-minute movie, also named &quot;Confessions of a Headhunter&quot;, was released. Directed by Sally Riley, the movie won Best Short Fiction Film at the 2000 AFI Awards. The following year the script won the Script Award in the 2001 Western Australian Premier&#x27;s Book Awards.

In 2002, the South African-born Australian poet John Mateer published his fourth collection of poems, entitled &quot;Loanwords&quot;. The collection is divided into four sections, of which the third, &quot;In the Presence of a Severed Head&quot;, has Yagan as its subject.

A two-part miniseries called &quot;Yagan&quot;, was commissioned by ABC International. Supported by Screen Australia, the documentary was written and directed by Kelrick Martin and produced by Derek Jowsey of Spear Point Productions, and released in 2012. It continues to be available on SBS On Demand.

===Other cultural references===
A section of &quot;Kullark&quot;, a play by Jack Davis, explores the deteriorating relationship between Yagan and a settler couple.

In September 1989 an early maturing cultivar of barley, bred by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture for performance on sandy soils, was released under the name &quot;&quot;Hordeum vulgare&quot; (Barley) c.v. Yagan&quot;. Commonly referred to simply as &quot;Yagan&quot;, the cultivar is named for Yagan, continuing a tradition of labelling Western Australian grain cultivars after historic people of Western Australia.

<text>In mathematics, the Legendre forms of [[elliptic integral]]s are a canonical set of three elliptic integrals to which all others may be reduced. Legendre chose the name &quot;elliptic integrals&quot; because the second kind gives the arc length of an ellipse of unit semi-major axis and eccentricity formula_1 (the ellipse being defined parametrically by formula_2, formula_3).

In modern times the Legendre forms have largely been supplanted by an alternative canonical set, the Carlson symmetric forms. A more detailed treatment of the Legendre forms is given in the main article on elliptic integrals.

== Definition ==

The incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind is defined as,

:formula_4

the second kind as

:formula_5

and the third kind as

:formula_6

The argument &quot;n&quot; of the third kind of integral is known as the characteristic, which in different notational conventions can appear as either the first, second or third argument of &quot;Π&quot; and furthermore is sometimes defined with the opposite sign. The argument order shown above is that of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik as well as Numerical Recipes. The choice of sign is that of Abramowitz and Stegun as well as Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, but corresponds to the formula_7 of Numerical Recipes.

The respective complete elliptic integrals are obtained by setting the amplitude, formula_8, the upper limit of the integrals, to formula_9.

The Legendre form of an elliptic curve is given by

:formula_10

== Numerical evaluation ==

The classic method of evaluation is by means of Landen&#x27;s transformations. Descending Landen transformation decreases the modulus formula_1 towards zero, while increasing the amplitude formula_8. Conversely, ascending transformation increases the modulus towards unity, while decreasing the amplitude. In either limit of formula_1 approaching zero or one, the integral is readily evaluated.

Most modern authors recommend evaluation in terms of the Carlson symmetric forms, for which there exist efficient, robust and relatively simple algorithms. This approach has been adopted by Boost C++ Libraries, GNU Scientific Library and Numerical Recipes.

<text>The Tall Guy is a 1989 British romantic comedy and the feature film debut of screenwriter Richard Curtis and director Mel Smith. It was produced by London Weekend Television for theatrical release and stars Jeff Goldblum, Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson. Curtis&#x27;s script draws from his experiences as straight man to long-time collaborator Rowan Atkinson.

==Plot==
The protagonist and narrator is Dexter King (Goldblum), an American actor working in London and living platonically in Camden Town with his &quot;educated, charming... nymphomaniac&quot; landlady (played by Geraldine James). He has just finished his sixth year playing &quot;The Tall Guy&quot;, a straight man in a two-man, long-running comedy revue starring (and dominated by) Ron Anderson (Rowan Atkinson, playing a role based on himself).

Chronic hay fever prompts him to see a doctor, where he meets and falls quickly in love with Kate (played by Emma Thompson), who works there as a nurse.

Soon after meeting Kate, Dexter is fired by Ron. After being rejected for a role in a new Steven Berkoff play for &quot;lacking anger&quot;, Dexter wins the title role in a new Royal Shakespeare Company musical based on &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;a sparkily nasty send-up of Andrew Lloyd Webber&quot; called &quot;Elephant!&quot; which features a song called &quot;He’s Packing His Trunk&quot; and a finale which ends with the lyric &quot;Somewhere up in heaven there&#x27;s an angel with big ears!&quot;

During rehearsal, Dexter succumbs to the advances of a married co-star (played by Kim Thomson). On the new musical&#x27;s opening night, Kate puts together evidence of the affair from a few subtle clues, and leaves Dexter without further ado.

After seeing a scene in a televised award show that suggests Ron is now dating Kate, Dexter impulsively gives up his role in &quot;Elephant!&quot; just before the curtain rises, with plans to make an impassioned plea to Kate to take him back. With Ron&#x27;s involuntary help (Dexter ties him up in his dressing room and steals his car), Dexter presents his case to Kate in a busy hospital ward. Kate agrees to give him another chance.

==Cast==
The cast includes:

* Jeff Goldblum as Dexter King
* Rowan Atkinson as Ron Anderson
* Emma Thompson as Kate Lemmon
* Geraldine James as Carmen
* Anna Massey as Mary
* Kim Thomson as Cheryl
* Hugh Thomas as Dr. Karabekian
* Emil Wolk as Cyprus Charlie
* Tim Barlow as Mr. Morrow
* Harold Innocent as Timothy
* Joanna Kanska as Tamara
* Angus Deayton as Actor in Agent&#x27;s Office
* Jason Isaacs as 2nd Doctor

The film also includes cameo appearances from John Inman, Melvyn Bragg, Suggs, Jonathan Ross and director Mel Smith.

==Production==
Principal photography occurred in 1988. Nearly twenty years later, Mel Smith, calling his directorial debut the high point of his career, commented on the directing experience: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know enough about the film business, and so it seemed wonderfully easy.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Upon its September 1990 US release, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B−, describing it as &quot;mildly charming and mostly too broad&quot; and accusing it of overplaying &quot;Dexter&#x27;s dorkiness in the same way it overplays the big sex scene, the romantic montage, the breakup scene…&quot; Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;even when its bright theatrical satire gives way to men dressed as nuns dancing in wimples and red sequined shorts, this modest comedy is always wickedly endearing, thanks to the off-kilter characters played by Mr. Goldblum and Emma Thompson as the unlikely woman of his dreams.&quot; Roger Ebert called the film a &quot;sweet, whimsical and surprisingly intelligent comedy&quot; whose &quot;last third ...turns into a hilarious sendup of the modern musical&quot; that &quot;must be the funniest deliberately bad play in a movie since Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; in &quot;The Producers&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Deseret News&quot; called it a &quot;most uneven romantic comedy,&quot; saying &quot;If you&#x27;re a Monty Python fan, lower your expectations a notch. We&#x27;re more in Benny Hill territory here...The highlights here are easily the staged &quot;Elephant!&quot; sequences, with some very funny sendups of the gargantuan musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 21 reviews and an average rating of 6.6/10. In a 2003 mid-career retrospective about Richard Curtis, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the film as being &quot;patronised in one sense by critics while not patronised in the other by audiences.&quot; It also identified several tropes from &quot;The Tall Guy&quot; that would be utilised in his subsequent romantic comedies, (&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and &quot;Love Actually&quot;):
* romantic lightning strikes that &quot;Curtis seems to believe in as much as any figure in history apart from Cupid&quot;;
* the &quot;willingness to sacrifice realism to a gag&quot; (e.g. turning cartwheels in front of a giant Moon to show that Dexter is in love);
* the &quot;wacky but wise&quot; flatmate;
* the use of eccentric obscenities (e.g. Ron&#x27;s question &quot;What in the name of Judas Iscariot&#x27;s bumboy is going on?&quot;).

===Box office===
The film grossed $5 million worldwide, including £1,586,383 in the United Kingdom and $510,712 in the United States and Canada.

==Soundtrack==
The score is by Peter Brewis. The soundtrack also includes Labi Siffre&#x27;s &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;, performed by Madness. The film features a montage in which various characters sing along to this song, and which includes a cameo by Madness frontman Suggs. Other tracks include &quot;Let the Heartaches Begin&quot; (Long John Baldry), &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; (Sam Williams), &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot; and &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot; (both performed by Phil Pope).

==Home video==
According to WorldCat, the film was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1990 by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video. It was released on VHS in the UK by Virgin Vision, and on DVD in 2003 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.

<doc id="406919" wikidata="Q5042922" url="?curid=406919" title="Carlson symmetric form">
<text>In mathematics, the Carlson symmetric forms of [[elliptic integral]]s are a small canonical set of elliptic integrals to which all others may be reduced. They are a modern alternative to the Legendre forms. The Legendre forms may be expressed in terms of the Carlson forms and vice versa.

The Carlson elliptic integrals are:
formula_1
formula_2
formula_3
formula_4
formula_5

Since formula_6 and formula_7 are special cases of formula_8 and formula_9, all elliptic integrals can ultimately be evaluated in terms of just formula_8, formula_9, and formula_12.

The term &quot;symmetric&quot; refers to the fact that in contrast to the Legendre forms, these functions are unchanged by the exchange of certain subsets of their arguments. The value of formula_13 is the same for any permutation of its arguments, and the value of formula_14 is the same for any permutation of its first three arguments.

The Carlson elliptic integrals are named after Bille C. Carlson (1924-2013).

==Relation to the Legendre forms==

===Incomplete elliptic integrals===

Incomplete elliptic integrals can be calculated easily using Carlson symmetric forms:

:formula_15

:formula_16

:formula_17

(Note: the above are only valid for formula_18 and formula_19)

===Complete elliptic integrals===

Complete elliptic integrals can be calculated by substituting φ = π:

:formula_20

:formula_21

:formula_22

==Special cases==

When any two, or all three of the arguments of formula_8 are the same, then a substitution of formula_24 renders the integrand rational. The integral can then be expressed in terms of elementary transcendental functions.

:formula_25

Similarly, when at least two of the first three arguments of formula_9 are the same,

:formula_27

==Properties==

===Homogeneity===

By substituting in the integral definitions formula_28 for any constant formula_29, it is found that

:formula_30

:formula_31

===Duplication theorem===

:formula_32

where formula_33.

:formula_34

where formula_35 and formula_36

==Series Expansion==

In obtaining a Taylor series expansion for formula_37 or formula_38 it proves convenient to expand about the mean value of the several arguments. So for formula_37, letting the mean value of the arguments be formula_40, and using homogeneity, define formula_41, formula_42 and formula_43 by

:formula_44

that is formula_45 etc. The differences formula_41, formula_42 and formula_43 are defined with this sign (such that they are &quot;subtracted&quot;), in order to be in agreement with Carlson&#x27;s papers. Since formula_49 is symmetric under permutation of formula_50, formula_51 and formula_52, it is also symmetric in the quantities formula_41, formula_42 and formula_43. It follows that both the integrand of formula_37 and its integral can be expressed as functions of the elementary symmetric polynomials in formula_41, formula_42 and formula_43 which are

:formula_60

:formula_61

:formula_62

Expressing the integrand in terms of these polynomials, performing a multidimensional Taylor expansion and integrating term-by-term...

:formula_63

The advantage of expanding about the mean value of the arguments is now apparent; it reduces formula_64 identically to zero, and so eliminates all terms involving formula_64 - which otherwise would be the most numerous.

An ascending series for formula_38 may be found in a similar way. There is a slight difficulty because formula_38 is not fully symmetric; its dependence on its fourth argument, formula_68, is different from its dependence on formula_50, formula_51 and formula_52. This is overcome by treating formula_38 as a fully symmetric function of &quot;five&quot; arguments, two of which happen to have the same value formula_68. The mean value of the arguments is therefore taken to be

:formula_74

and the differences formula_41, formula_42 formula_43 and formula_78 defined by

:formula_79

The elementary symmetric polynomials in formula_41, formula_42, formula_43, formula_78 and (again) formula_78 are in full

:formula_85

:formula_86

:formula_87

:formula_88

:formula_89

However, it is possible to simplify the formulae for formula_90, formula_91 and formula_92 using the fact that formula_93. Expressing the integrand in terms of these polynomials, performing a multidimensional Taylor expansion and integrating term-by-term as before...

:formula_94

As with formula_38, by expanding about the mean value of the arguments, more than half the terms (those involving formula_64) are eliminated.

==Negative arguments==

In general, the arguments x, y, z of Carlson&#x27;s integrals may not be real and negative, as this would place a branch point on the path of integration, making the integral ambiguous. However, if the second argument of formula_6, or the fourth argument, p, of formula_9 is negative, then this results in a simple pole on the path of integration. In these cases the Cauchy principal value (finite part) of the integrals may be of interest; these are

:formula_99

and

:formula_100
where

:formula_101

which must be greater than zero for formula_102 to be evaluated. This may be arranged by permuting x, y and z so that the value of y is between that of x and z.

==Numerical evaluation==

The duplication theorem can be used for a fast and robust evaluation of the Carlson symmetric form of elliptic integrals
and therefore also for the evaluation of Legendre-form of elliptic integrals. Let us calculate formula_13:
first, define formula_104, formula_105 and formula_106. Then iterate the series

:formula_107
:formula_108
until the desired precision is reached: if formula_50, formula_51 and formula_52 are non-negative, all of the series will converge quickly to a given value, say, formula_112. Therefore,

:formula_113

Evaluating formula_114 is much the same due to the relation

:formula_115

<text>Virulence is a pathogen&#x27;s or microorganism&#x27;s ability to cause damage to a host.

In most cases, especially in animal systems, virulence refers to the degree of damage caused by a microbe to its host. The pathogenicity of an organism—its ability to cause disease—is determined by its virulence factors. In the specific context of gene for gene systems, often in plants, virulence refers to a pathogen&#x27;s ability to infect a resistant host. Virulence can also be transferred using a plasmid.

The noun &quot;virulence&quot; (Latin noun ) derives from the adjective &quot;virulent&quot;, meaning disease severity. The word &quot;virulent&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;virulentus&quot;, meaning &quot;a poisoned wound&quot; or &quot;full of poison&quot;. The term &quot;virulence&quot; does not only apply to viruses.

From an ecological standpoint, virulence is the loss of fitness induced by a parasite upon its host. Virulence can be understood in terms of proximate causes—those specific traits of the pathogen that help make the host ill—and ultimate causes—the evolutionary pressures that lead to virulent traits occurring in a pathogen strain.

==Virulent bacteria==
The ability of bacteria to cause disease is described in terms of the number of infecting bacteria, the route of entry into the body, the effects of host defense mechanisms, and intrinsic characteristics of the bacteria called virulence factors. Many virulence factors are so-called effector proteins that are injected into the host cells by specialized secretion apparati, such as the type three secretion system. Host-mediated pathogenesis is often important because the host can respond aggressively to infection with the result that host defense mechanisms do damage to host tissues while the infection is being countered (e.g., cytokine storm).

The virulence factors of bacteria are typically proteins or other molecules that are synthesized by enzymes. These proteins are coded for by genes in chromosomal DNA, bacteriophage DNA or plasmids. Certain bacteria employ mobile genetic elements and horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these specific virulence factors and mobile genetic elements have been proposed. Bacteria use quorum sensing to synchronise release of the molecules. These are all proximate causes of morbidity in the host.

===Methods by which bacteria cause disease===

; Adhesion: Many bacteria must first bind to host cell surfaces. Many bacterial and host molecules that are involved in the adhesion of bacteria to host cells have been identified. Often, the host cell surface receptors for bacteria are essential proteins for other functions. Due to the presence of mucus lining and of anti-microbial substances around some host cells, it is difficult for certain pathogens to establish direct contact-adhesion.
; Colonization: Some virulent bacteria produce special proteins that allow them to colonize parts of the host body. &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is able to survive in the acidic environment of the human stomach by producing the enzyme urease. Colonization of the stomach lining by this bacterium can lead to gastric ulcers and cancer. The virulence of various strains of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; tends to correlate with the level of production of urease.
; Invasion: Some virulent bacteria produce proteins that either disrupt host cell membranes or stimulate their own endocytosis or macropinocytosis into host cells. These virulence factors allow the bacteria to enter host cells and facilitate entry into the body across epithelial tissue layers at the body surface.
; Immune response inhibitors: Many bacteria produce virulence factors that inhibit the host&#x27;s immune system defenses. For example, a common bacterial strategy is to produce proteins that bind host antibodies. The polysaccharide capsule of &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; inhibits phagocytosis of the bacterium by host immune cells.
; Toxins: Many virulence factors are proteins made by bacteria that poison host cells and cause tissue damage. For example, there are many food poisoning toxins produced by bacteria that can contaminate human foods. Some of these can remain in &quot;spoiled&quot; food even after cooking and cause illness when the contaminated food is consumed. Other bacterial toxins are chemically altered and inactivated by the heat of cooking.

==Virulent viruses==
Virus virulence factors allow it to replicate, modify host defenses, and spread within the host, and they are toxic to the host.

They determine whether infection occurs and how severe the resulting viral disease symptoms are. Viruses often require receptor proteins on host cells to which they specifically bind. Typically, these host cell proteins are endocytosed and the bound virus then enters the host cell. Virulent viruses such as HIV, which causes AIDS, have mechanisms for evading host defenses. HIV infects T-helper cells, which leads to a reduction of the adaptive immune response of the host and eventually leads to an immunocompromised state. Death results from opportunistic infections secondary to disruption of the immune system caused by AIDS. Some viral virulence factors confer ability to replicate during the defensive inflammation responses of the host such as during virus-induced fever. Many viruses can exist inside a host for long periods during which little damage is done. Extremely virulent strains can eventually evolve by mutation and natural selection within the virus population inside a host. The term &quot;neurovirulent&quot; is used for viruses such as rabies and herpes simplex which can invade the nervous system and cause disease there.

Extensively studied model organisms of virulent viruses include virus T4 and other T-even bacteriophages which infect Escherichia coli and a number of related bacteria.

The lytic life cycle of virulent bacteriophages is contrasted by the temperate lifecycle of temperate bacteriophages.

<text>Carnac Island () is a , A-Class, island nature reserve about south-west of Fremantle and north of Garden Island in Western Australia.

==History==
Carnac Island is aeolianite limestone remnant of Pleistocene dunes.

In 1803, French explorer Louis de Freycinet, captain of , named the island (&#x27;Bald Island&#x27;). It was also known as and later . In 1827, James Stirling changed its name to &quot;Pulo Carnac Island&quot; in honour of John Rivett Carnac, Second Lieutenant on his ship . &quot;Pulo&quot; is Malay for &quot;island&quot;; it is not known why Stirling included the term, and it was soon dropped.

From , the island served as a whaling station. The whalers transported Perth&#x27;s first church to the island to be used as a storehouse. It was abandoned within a few years. 

From October to November 1838, the island was declared by the Swan River Colony colonial government to be a prison for indigenous Australians. The prison consisted of two guards, an overseer named Robert Menli Lyon, and three prisoners named Yagan, Danmera, and Ningina. The solitary conditions resulted in the soldiers assisting the prisoners&#x27; escape in a stolen government stores boat. 

In 1884, the colonial government gazetted the island as a quarantine station for Fremantle, but it appears never to have been used for that purpose. 

In 1916, the Australian Federal Government assumed control over the island for defence purposes, and the island was transferred back to the State of Western Australia in 1961.

The Carnac Island Nature Reserve was gazetted on 8 March 1963, has a size of , and is located within the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion. Apart from Carnac Island itself, the nature reserve includes the rocks north and south of the island.

==Fauna==

The island is home to Australian sea lions, bottlenose dolphins and a large range of marine bird life. New Zealand fur seals are frequent visitors. Rabbits inhabited the island in abundance from 1827 to 1897, but were eradicated in 1969. It is particularly noted for the abundance and size of snakes, particularly tiger snakes, which live there. The island is densely populated with up to three tiger snakes in every .

There is no permanent fresh water, providing a challenge for the animals that live there. The tiger snake colony has attracted research into how that species has adapted to a harsh island habitat, and the colony&#x27;s origins has attracted significant debate. One example of a theory is that in 1929 a man named Lindsay &quot;Rocky&quot; Vane dumped his tiger snake collection on the island, after snake exhibitions were banned in Western Australia, after Vane&#x27;s wife and his assistant died from snake bite. King skinks also inhabit the island, and there is evidence of confrontation between king skinks and tiger snakes. 

In November 2006, naturalist David Attenborough visited the island with a BBC film crew to record a reptile documentary, in which Attenborough provided commentary on the blindness of many of the island&#x27;s tiger snakes. This is caused by birds defending their chicks by pecking at the snakes&#x27; eyes. These blind snakes survive and thrive, relying upon scent and eating immobile prey such as seabird chicks. Carnac Island is the only place where this has been observed. Male tiger snakes largely out-number female tiger snakes on the island, which is another curiosity of the island&#x27;s tiger snake colony. 

Carnac Island is classified as an Important Bird Area because it supports a large colony of the vulnerable fairy tern, as well as small numbers of other nesting seabirds.

<doc id="406932" wikidata="Q857956" url="?curid=406932" title="Polygamma function">
<text>In mathematics, the polygamma function of order is a meromorphic function on the complex numbers formula_1 defined as the th derivative of the logarithm of the gamma function:

:formula_2

Thus

:formula_3

holds where is the digamma function and is the gamma function. They are holomorphic on formula_4. At all the nonpositive integers these polygamma functions have a pole of order . The function is sometimes called the trigamma function.

==Integral representation==

When and , the polygamma function equals

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the Hurwitz zeta function.

This expresses the polygamma function as the Laplace transform of . It follows from Bernstein&#x27;s theorem on monotone functions that, for and real and non-negative, is a completely monotone function.

Setting in the above formula does not give an integral representation of the digamma function. The digamma function has an integral representation, due to Gauss, which is similar to the case above but which has an extra term .

==Recurrence relation==
It satisfies the recurrence relation
:formula_7

which – considered for positive integer argument – leads to a presentation of the sum of reciprocals of the powers of the natural numbers:

:formula_8

and

:formula_9

for all formula_10, where formula_11 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. Like the log-gamma function, the polygamma functions can be generalized from the domain uniquely to positive real numbers only due to their recurrence relation and one given function-value, say , except in the case where the additional condition of strict monotonicity on formula_12 is still needed. This is a trivial consequence of the Bohr–Mollerup theorem for the gamma function where strictly logarithmic convexity on formula_12 is demanded additionally. The case must be treated differently because is not normalizable at infinity (the sum of the reciprocals doesn&#x27;t converge).

==Reflection relation==
:formula_14

where is alternately an odd or even polynomial of degree with integer coefficients and leading coefficient . They obey the recursion equation

:formula_15

==Multiplication theorem==
The multiplication theorem gives

:formula_16

and

:formula_17

for the digamma function.

==Series representation==
The polygamma function has the series representation

:formula_18

which holds for integer values of and any complex not equal to a negative integer. This representation can be written more compactly in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function as

:formula_19

This relation can for example be used to compute the special values
:formula_20
:formula_21
:formula_22
:formula_23

Alternately, the Hurwitz zeta can be understood to generalize the polygamma to arbitrary, non-integer order.

One more series may be permitted for the polygamma functions. As given by Schlömilch,

:formula_24

This is a result of the Weierstrass factorization theorem. Thus, the gamma function may now be defined as:

:formula_25

Now, the natural logarithm of the gamma function is easily representable:

:formula_26

Finally, we arrive at a summation representation for the polygamma function:

:formula_27

Where is the Kronecker delta.

Also the Lerch transcendent
:formula_28

can be denoted in terms of polygamma function

:formula_29

==Taylor series==
The Taylor series at is

:formula_30

and

:formula_31

which converges for . Here, is the Riemann zeta function. This series is easily derived from the corresponding Taylor series for the Hurwitz zeta function. This series may be used to derive a number of rational zeta series.

==Asymptotic expansion==
These non-converging series can be used to get quickly an approximation value with a certain numeric at-least-precision for large arguments:

: formula_32
and
:formula_33

where we have chosen , i.e. the Bernoulli numbers of the second kind.

==Inequalities==
The hyperbolic cotangent satisfies the inequality
:formula_34
and this implies that the function
:formula_35
is non-negative for all and . It follows that the Laplace transform of this function is completely monotone. By the integral representation above, we conclude that
:formula_36
is completely monotone. The convexity inequality implies that
:formula_37
is non-negative for all and , so a similar Laplace transformation argument yields the complete monotonicity of
:formula_38
Therefore, for all and ,
:formula_39
Since both bounds are &quot;strictly&quot; positive for formula_40, we have:
* formula_41 is strictly convex.
* For formula_42, the digamma function, formula_43, is strictly monotonic increasing and strictly concave.
* For formula_44 odd, the polygamma functions, formula_45, are strictly positive, strictly monotonic decreasing and strictly convex.
* For formula_44 even the polygamma functions, formula_47, are strictly negative, strictly monotonic increasing and strictly concave. 
This can be seen in the first plot above.

===Trigamma bounds and asymptote===
For the case of the trigamma function (formula_48) the final inequality formula above for formula_40, can be rewritten as:
:formula_50
so that for formula_51: formula_52.

<text>In mathematics, the digamma function is defined as the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function:

:formula_1

It is the first of the polygamma functions. This function is strictly increasing and strictly concave on formula_2, and it asymptotically behaves as

:formula_3

for complex numbers with large modulus (formula_4) in the sector formula_5 with some infinitesimally small positive constant formula_6.

The digamma function is often denoted as formula_7 or (the uppercase form of the archaic Greek consonant digamma meaning double-gamma).

==Relation to harmonic numbers==
The gamma function obeys the equation

:formula_8

Taking the logarithm on both sides and using the functional equation property of the log-gamma function gives:

:formula_9

Differentiating both sides with respect to gives:

:formula_10

Since the harmonic numbers are defined for positive integers as

:formula_11

the digamma function is related to them by

:formula_12

where and is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. For half-integer arguments the digamma function takes the values

:formula_13

==Integral representations==
If the real part of is positive then the digamma function has the following integral representation due to Gauss:
:formula_14

Combining this expression with an integral identity for the Euler–Mascheroni constant formula_15 gives:
:formula_16
The integral is Euler&#x27;s harmonic number formula_17, so the previous formula may also be written
:formula_18
A consequence is the following generalization of the recurrence relation:
:formula_19

An integral representation due to Dirichlet is:
:formula_20

Gauss&#x27;s integral representation can be manipulated to give the start of the asymptotic expansion of formula_21.
:formula_22
This formula is also a consequence of Binet&#x27;s first integral for the gamma function. The integral may be recognized as a Laplace transform.

Binet&#x27;s second integral for the gamma function gives a different formula for formula_21 which also gives the first few terms of the asymptotic expansion:
:formula_24

From the definition of formula_21 and the integral representation of the gamma function, one obtains
:formula_26
with formula_27.

==Infinite product representation==
The function formula_28 is an entire function, and it can be represented by the infinite product

:formula_29

Here formula_30 is the &quot;k&quot;th zero of formula_21 (see below), and formula_15 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

Note: This is also equal to formula_33 due to the definition of the digamma function: formula_34.

== Series representation ==
===Series formula===
Euler&#x27;s product formula for the gamma function, combined with the functional equation and an identity for the Euler–Mascheroni constant, yields the following expression for the digamma function, valid in the complex plane outside the negative integers (Abramowitz and Stegun 6.3.16):
:formula_35
Equivalently,
:formula_36

====Evaluation of sums of rational functions====
The above identity can be used to evaluate sums of the form
: formula_37
where and are polynomials of .

Performing partial fraction on in the complex field, in the case when all roots of are simple roots,

: formula_38

For the series to converge,

:formula_39

otherwise the series will be greater than the harmonic series and thus diverge. Hence

:formula_40

and

:formula_41

With the series expansion of higher rank polygamma function a generalized formula can be given as

:formula_42

provided the series on the left converges.

===Taylor series===
The digamma has a rational zeta series, given by the Taylor series at . This is

:formula_43

which converges for . Here, is the Riemann zeta function. This series is easily derived from the corresponding Taylor&#x27;s series for the Hurwitz zeta function.

===Newton series===
The Newton series for the digamma, sometimes referred to as &quot;Stern series&quot;, derived by Moritz Abraham Stern in 1847, reads

:formula_44

where is the binomial coefficient. It may also be generalized to 
:formula_45
where 
===Series with Gregory&#x27;s coefficients, Cauchy numbers and Bernoulli polynomials of the second kind===
There exist various series for the digamma containing rational coefficients only for the rational arguments. In particular, the series with Gregory&#x27;s coefficients is
:formula_46
: formula_47
: formula_48
where is the &quot;rising factorial&quot; , are the Gregory coefficients of higher order with , is the gamma function and is the Hurwitz zeta function.
Similar series with the Cauchy numbers of the second kind reads
:formula_49
A series with the Bernoulli polynomials of the second kind has the following form
:formula_50
where are the &quot;Bernoulli polynomials of the second kind&quot; defined by the generating
equation
: formula_51
It may be generalized to
: formula_52
where the polynomials are given by the following generating equation
: formula_53
so that . Similar expressions with the logarithm of the gamma function involve these formulas
: formula_54
and
: formula_55
where formula_56 and formula_57.

==Reflection formula==
The digamma and polygamma functions satisfy reflection formulas similar to that of the gamma function:

:formula_58.
:formula_59.

==Recurrence formula and characterization==
The digamma function satisfies the recurrence relation

:formula_60

Thus, it can be said to &quot;telescope&quot; , for one has

:formula_61

where is the forward difference operator. This satisfies the recurrence relation of a partial sum of the harmonic series, thus implying the formula

:formula_62

where is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

Actually, is the only solution of the functional equation

:formula_63

that is monotonic on and satisfies . This fact follows immediately from the uniqueness of the function given its recurrence equation and convexity restriction. This implies the useful difference equation:

: formula_64

==Some finite sums involving the digamma function==
There are numerous finite summation formulas for the digamma function. Basic summation formulas, such as

:formula_65
:formula_66
:formula_67
: formula_68

are due to Gauss. More complicated formulas, such as

: formula_69
: formula_70
:formula_71
:formula_72
:formula_73
:formula_74
:formula_75

are due to works of certain modern authors (see e.g. Appendix B in Blagouchine (2014)).

We also have 
:formula_76

==Gauss&#x27;s digamma theorem==
For positive integers and (), the digamma function may be expressed in terms of Euler&#x27;s constant and a finite number of elementary functions

:formula_77

which holds, because of its recurrence equation, for all rational arguments.

==Multiplication theorem==
The multiplication theorem of the formula_78-function is equivalent to
:formula_79

==Asymptotic expansion==
The digamma function has the asymptotic expansion
:formula_80
where is the th Bernoulli number and is the Riemann zeta function. The first few terms of this expansion are:
:formula_81
Although the infinite sum does not converge for any , any finite partial sum becomes increasingly accurate as increases.

The expansion can be found by applying the Euler–Maclaurin formula to the sum
:formula_82
The expansion can also be derived from the integral representation coming from Binet&#x27;s second integral formula for the gamma function. Expanding formula_83 as a geometric series and substituting an integral representation of the Bernoulli numbers leads to the same asymptotic series as above. Furthermore, expanding only finitely many terms of the series gives a formula with an explicit error term:
:formula_84

==Inequalities==
When , the function
:formula_85
is completely monotonic and in particular positive. This is a consequence of Bernstein&#x27;s theorem on monotone functions applied to the integral representation coming from Binet&#x27;s first integral for the gamma function. Additionally, by the convexity inequality formula_86, the integrand in this representation is bounded above by formula_87. 
:formula_88
is also completely monotonic. It follows that, for all ,
:formula_89
This recovers a theorem of Horst Alzer. Alzer also proved that, for ,
:formula_90

Related bounds were obtained by Elezovic, Giordano, and Pecaric, who proved that, for ,
:formula_91
where formula_92 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. The constants (formula_93 and formula_94) appearing in these bounds are the best possible.

The mean value theorem implies the following analog of Gautschi&#x27;s inequality: If , where is the unique positive real root of the digamma function, and if , then
:formula_95
Moreover, equality holds if and only if .

Inspired by the harmonic mean value inequality for the classical gamma function, Horzt Alzer and Graham Jameson proved, among other things, a harmonic mean-value inequality for the digamma function:

formula_96 for formula_97

Equality holds if and only if formula_98.

==Computation and approximation==
The asymptotic expansion gives an easy way to compute when the real part of is large. To compute for small , the recurrence relation

:formula_99

can be used to shift the value of to a higher value. Beal suggests using the above recurrence to shift to a value greater than 6 and then applying the above expansion with terms above cut off, which yields &quot;more than enough precision&quot; (at least 12 digits except near the zeroes).

As goes to infinity, gets arbitrarily close to both and . Going down from to , decreases by , decreases by , which is more than , and decreases by , which is less than . From this we see that for any positive greater than ,

:formula_100

or, for any positive ,

:formula_101

The exponential is approximately for large , but gets closer to at small , approaching 0 at .

For , we can calculate limits based on the fact that between 1 and 2, , so

:formula_102
or
:formula_103

From the above asymptotic series for , one can derive an asymptotic series for . The series matches the overall behaviour well, that is, it behaves asymptotically as it should for large arguments, and has a zero of unbounded multiplicity at the origin too.

:formula_104

This is similar to a Taylor expansion of at , but it does not converge. (The function is not analytic at infinity.) A similar series exists for which starts with formula_105

If one calculates the asymptotic series for it turns out that there are no odd powers of (there is no −1 term). This leads to the following asymptotic expansion, which saves computing terms of even order.

:formula_106

Similar in spirit to the Lanczos approximation of the formula_78-function is Spouge&#x27;s approximation.

Another alternative is to use the recurrence relation or the multiplication formula to shift the argument of formula_108 into the range formula_109 and to evaluate the Chebyshev series there.

==Special values==
The digamma function has values in closed form for rational numbers, as a result of Gauss&#x27;s digamma theorem. Some are listed below:

:formula_110

Moreover, by taking the logarithmic derivative of formula_111 or formula_112 where formula_113 is real-valued, it can easily be deduced that

:formula_114
:formula_115

Apart from Gauss&#x27;s digamma theorem, no such closed formula is known for the real part in general. We have, for example, at the imaginary unit the numerical approximation
:formula_116

==Roots of the digamma function==
The roots of the digamma function are the saddle points of the complex-valued gamma function. Thus they lie all on the real axis. The only one on the positive real axis is the unique minimum of the real-valued gamma function on at . All others occur single between the poles on the negative axis:
:
:
:formula_117

Already in 1881, Charles Hermite observed that

:formula_118

holds asymptotically. A better approximation of the location of the roots is given by

:formula_119

and using a further term it becomes still better

:formula_120

which both spring off the reflection formula via

:formula_121

and substituting by its not convergent asymptotic expansion. The correct second term of this expansion is , where the given one works well to approximate roots with small .

Another improvement of Hermite&#x27;s formula can be given:
:formula_122

Regarding the zeros, the following infinite sum identities were recently proved by István Mező and Michael Hoffman
:formula_123

In general, the function
:formula_124
can be determined and it is studied in detail by the cited authors.

The following results
:formula_125
also hold true.
==Regularization==
The digamma function appears in the regularization of divergent integrals

:formula_126

this integral can be approximated by a divergent general Harmonic series, but the following value can be attached to the series

:formula_127

==In applied mathematics==
Many notable probability distributions use the gamma function in the definition of their probability density or mass functions. Then in statistics when doing maximum likelihood estimation on models involving such distributions, the digamma function naturally appears when the derivative of the log-likelihood is taken for finding the maxima.

<text>Robert Laurel Crippen (born September 11, 1937) is an American retired naval officer and aviator, test pilot, aerospace engineer, and retired astronaut. He traveled into space four times: as pilot of STS-1 in April 1981, the first Space Shuttle mission; and as commander of STS-7 in June 1983, STS-41-C in April 1984, and STS-41-G in October 1984. He was also a part of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test (SMEAT), ASTP support crew member, and the Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) for the Space Shuttle.

In 1986, Crippen participated in the recovery operations for the remains of crew members after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. He was also on the commission responsible for determining the cause of the accident.

After retiring as an astronaut, Crippen worked his way through management at NASA, namely as Director, Space Shuttle, at NASA Headquarters, then Director of the Kennedy Space Center. He also went to Lockheed Martin and Thiokol Propulsion before retiring to private life in Florida.

Crippen has received several awards and honors, including the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 2006, and having an elementary school named after him in Porter, Texas. He is also a fellow of several organizations, including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP).

== Early life and education ==
Robert Crippen was born in Beaumont, Texas, on September 11, 1937. After graduating from New Caney High School in New Caney, Texas in 1955, Crippen went to the University of Texas at Austin to major in Aerospace Engineering. In 1960, he graduated with his Bachelor of Science degree. He was selected as a member of the Texas Alpha chapter of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Gamma Tau.

Crippen became interested in flying and computers at a very early age. He attended the first computer programming class held at the University of Texas. Throughout his career in the military and at NASA, he worked on computer programming, including programs such as the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, Skylab and the Space Shuttle.

== Military career ==
Crippen was commissioned through the United States Navy&#x27;s Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) Program at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. He also spent time at the Naval Air Station Whiting Field in Florida and the Naval Air Station Chase Field in Beeville, Texas. That is where he earned his wings. As a Naval Aviator from the summer of 1962 to the end of 1964, he made two deployments aboard the USS &quot;Independence&quot;, flying the A-4 Skyhawk in Attack Squadron 72 (VA-72). He later went to Edwards Air Force Base in California to attend the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School. After graduation, Crippen worked as an instructor at Edwards Air Force Base until October 1966 when he was picked for the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program. He has spent more than 6,500 hours in the air as either a pilot or an astronaut.

=== Manned Orbiting Laboratory ===

The Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program was a follow-on to the X-20 Dyna-Soar program. A joint program between the United States Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the MOL program would send humans into space.

Publicly, the MOL program was designed to determine the usefulness of man in space. Crews would be in orbit for about a month and they would be able to freely move about the laboratory. The secret and primary mission was to perform reconnaissance missions on Soviet Union and China. The pilots were not told of this true mission, though they were later informed. 

When Crippen was selected for astronaut training in October 1966, he had to choose between the military and NASA, deciding to stay in the military to work on the MOL program. He felt that he would get lost at NASA due to the number of astronauts already in programs at the agency. There was an uncrewed flight on November 3, 1966. There were no crewed flights.

The MOL program was canceled in June 1969, after which Crippen transferred to NASA to continue his career. The cancellation was due to differing priorities within the military and space programs, with the government deciding to de-emphasize military involvement in the space program. However, developments like the space suit, waste management, and the high resolution camera were later used in various space programs going forward.

== NASA career ==
 After the MOL program was canceled, Crippen became part of NASA Astronaut Group 7 in September 1969. He served as support for the Skylab 2, Skylab 3, and Skylab 4, as well as for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.

=== Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test (SMEAT) ===
The Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test (SMEAT) was a 56-day mission (July 26 through September 19, 1972), where astronauts Crippen, Karol J. Bobko and William E. Thornton were housed in a vacuum chamber to conduct medical experiments. The goal was to ensure that crews in space could handle minor medical emergencies, including dentistry. SMEAT also was able to discover and fix the design flaws in the urine handling system for Skylab. Crippen and the team worked to enlarge the original collection system design, which was too small, the collection system of which had burst at one point.

=== Apollo-Soyuz Test Project ===
The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) was a joint effort between the United States and the Soviet Union, designed to test rendezvous and docking capabilities if there were ever an emergency in space. Crippen was the capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (as well as Skylab), during which time he developed a close association with Mission Operations and Flight Control. On July 15, 1975, the United States launched a Saturn IB launch vehicle in an Apollo configuration into space. Two days later, it docked with a Soyuz spacecraft.

=== Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) ===
The Approach and Landing tests for the Space Shuttle were critical to the overall program, in which a crew tested the maneuverability and landing capabilities of the spacecraft. Launched from a 747 aircraft, the prototype Space Shuttle Enterprise was first tested on August 12, 1977. Astronauts Fred W. Haise Jr. and C. Gordon Fullerton piloted the Enterprise from about to the ground and landed at Edwards Air Force Base. A second crew of astronauts Joe H. Engle and Richard H. Truly alternated with Haise and Fullerton to test the Enterprise&#x27;s capabilities. Crippen was first assigned to family support with the testing, then progressed to being a chase pilot in a T-38. The ALT program lasted about a year, testing all aspects of approach and touchdown from aerodynamics to maneuverability, gliding and landing characteristics.

=== STS-1 ===

Crippen was the pilot of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; on STS-1, the first test flight of the Space Shuttle in orbit. His job involved working with the Shuttle computers, electrical systems, and auxiliary power units. He was also responsible for operating the payload bay doors. STS-1 had several firsts: a crewed vehicle to be flown into Earth orbit without any prior non-crewed orbital testing; a crewed, winged vehicle to launch with solid rocket boosters; a reentry vehicle to land on a conventional runway. It launched April 12, 1981, and landed April 14, 1981.

=== STS-7 ===
Crippen served as the commander of STS-7, the second launch of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, and headed a crew of five people. During flight, the team deployed the Canadian Anik-C2 satellite, as well as the Palapa-B1 satellite from Indonesia. They also used the Canadian Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) to deploy and retrieve the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS-01). They conducted formation flying with an untethered satellite (SPAS-02), operated a joint U.S.-German materials experiment (OSTA-2) and activated seven Getaway Special (GAS) experiments. Finally, they worked with the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR). It launched June 18, 1983, and landed on June 24, 1983.

=== STS-41-C ===
Crippen was the commander of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; on STS-41-C, a seven-day mission during which the crew deployed the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). The crew also retrieved, repaired and redeployed Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) satellite using the Canadarm. The flight also tested the Manned Maneuvering Units (MMU) through two extravehicular activities (EVAs). The team also operated the Cinema 360 and IMAX Camera Systems. Finally, the crew ran a student experiment on honey bees. It launched April 6, 1984, and landed April 13, 1984.

=== STS-41-G ===
On his final spaceflight, Crippen served as the commander of STS-41-G. During the eight-day flight, the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; crew deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS). They also performed scientific observations of the Earth with a Large Format Camera, and demonstrated potential satellite refueling with the Orbital Refueling System (ORS). Finally, the Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications-3 (OSTA-3) also had experiments for the crew to perform. It launched October 5, 1984, and landed October 13, 1984, at Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

=== Post-spaceflight career ===
After STS-41-G, Crippen became deputy director of flight crew operations (1984–1986) and was also named commander of the STS-62-A mission which would have launched from the new SLC-6 facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. That mission was canceled after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986, and SLC-6 was mothballed in 1989.

Crippen was personally involved in the recovery efforts of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, brooking no interference in recovering all seven bodies of the Challenger crew for their families. Crippen was also a part of the STS-51-L Interim Mishap Review Board to examine the cause of the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident. The Board became a sub-team for the Rogers Commission Report, the team put together by President Ronald Reagan to investigate the accident.

Crippen was stationed at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) from July 1987 to December 1989 where he was Deputy Director of Shuttle Operations under Arnie Aldrich, Director of Space Shuttle. He was accountable for Shuttle missions and the return of the craft to KSC after landings at Edwards.

From January 1990 to January 1992, Crippen served as Director of the Space Shuttle program at NASA Headquarters. As such, he was responsible for the all aspects of the Shuttle program, including scheduling, budget and overall program management. Afterwards, he moved to KSC to become center director. This lasted from January 1992 through January 1995.

== Post-NASA career ==
After leaving NASA, from April 1995 through November 1996, Crippen was the Vice President of Lockheed Martin Information Systems. His main focus was simulation work supporting the military.

Crippen became President of Thiokol Propulsion from December 1996 through April 2001. They were responsible for producing the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motors. Crippen enjoyed continuing his connection with the Space Shuttle program. In particular, he appreciated his role in working to improve the design of the solid rocket boosters to prevent another &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

== Organizations ==
Crippen is a fellow in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP), and the American Astronautical Society (AAS). He served as President of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1999. He was selected to be a member of Naval Aviators Golden Eagles in 2009. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2012 for leadership in human space flight and development of solid fueled rockets.

== Awards and honors ==
Crippen has earned several awards throughout his career, including the SETP Iven C. Kincheloe Award (1981) and the NASA Exceptional Service Medal (1972). In 1981, after the inaugural Space Shuttle flight, he received the Department of Defense Distinguished Service Award, the American Astronautical Society&#x27;s Flight Achievement Award, the National Geographic Society&#x27;s Gardiner Greene Hubbard Medal, and the American Legion&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal. He was awarded the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)&#x27;s Award for Distinguished Service (1982), the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy and the Harmon Trophy. He received the Navy Distinguished Flying Cross (1984) and the Defense Meritorious Service Medal (1984). Finally, Crippen received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1986).

He also received NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, four NASA Space Flight Medals, and three NASA Distinguished Service Medals. In 1996, Crippen became the tenth individual to receive the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement&#x27;s National Space Trophy. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1991 and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2001. On April 6, 2006, he received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, the highest award for spaceflight achievement.

On November 18, 2015, at the National Business Aviation Association convention in Las Vegas, Crippen was announced as a 2016 Inductee into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

On December 15, 2023, Crippen received the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association in Washington, D.C. for his devotion to public service and the advancement of American aerospace; his achievements as an aviator, astronaut, and leader; and his selfless dedication to the future of humankind.

== Personal life ==
Crippen was first married to Virginia Hill on September 8, 1959. They had three daughters together: Ellen Marie (born June 1962), Susan Lynn (born December 1964), and Linda Ruth (born May 1967). On November 7, 1987, he married Pandora Puckett, NASA&#x27;s first female lead Orbiter Project Engineer, on the and at the Kennedy Space Center.

<doc id="406945" wikidata="Q335754" url="?curid=406945" title="Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby">
<text>Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby (21 April 1775 – 30 June 1851), styled Lord Stanley from 1776 to 1832, and Baron Stanley of Bickerstaffe from 1832–4, was an English politician, peer, landowner, builder, farmer, art collector and naturalist. He was the patron of the writer Edward Lear.

==Origins==

He was the eldest child and only son and heir of Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby (1752–1834) by his wife Elizabeth Hamilton, a daughter of James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton.

==Career==
He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. On 10 November 1796 he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire and in the same year he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Preston. He held this seat until 1812 and then represented Lancashire until 1832, when he was ennobled as Baron Stanley of Bickerstaffe, of Bickerstaffe in the County Palatine of Lancaster.

===Military career===
He was commissioned Colonel of the 1st Royal Lancashire Supplementary Militia on 1 March 1797; this regiment subsequently became the 2nd Royal Lancashire Militia. He was breveted as a colonel in the regular Army with seniority from that date, retaining the rank until his regiment was disembodied, which occurred at the end of 1799. He resigned his commission as colonel on 13 April 1847.

==Naturalist==
In 1834 he succeeded his father as 13th Earl of Derby and withdrew from politics, instead concentrating on his natural history collection at Knowsley Hall, near Liverpool. He had a large collection of living animals: at his death, there were 1,272 birds and 345 mammals at Knowsley, shipped to England by explorers such as Joseph Burke. From 1828 to 1833 he was President of the Linnean Society. Many of Derby&#x27;s collections are now housed in Liverpool&#x27;s World Museum. Several species were named after him, for example the Derbyan parakeet, &quot;Psittacula derbiana&quot; and an Australian species of parrot named firstly by Nicholas Vigors as &quot;Platycercus stanleyii&quot;, in 1830 when he was Lord Stanley, and referred to in the vernacular as &quot;The Earl of Derby’s Parrakeet&quot; by the author John Gould in the sixth volume of his magnum opus &quot;Birds of Australia&quot;. However the latter species was found to have been named previously as &quot;Platycercus icterotis&quot;, and thus &quot;Platycercus stanleyii&quot; was found to have been an invalid name due to the pre-existence of a published description for the species, according to &quot;the inviolable laws of precedence in deliberations on biological nomenclature&quot;. From the Earl of Derby&#x27;s Collection, the State Library of NSW purchased six volumes of exquisite Australian natural history drawings dating from the early days of British settlement in NSW and this Library publishes talks and exhibitions of its research on this collection.

He founded in 1851 with his natural history&#x27;s collection a museum in Liverpool, the Derby Museum, the current World Museum, the oldest of the National Museums Liverpool group.

==Marriage and issue==

On 30 June 1798, Smith-Stanley married his cousin Charlotte Margaret Hornby (d.1817), second daughter of Rev. Geoffrey Hornby (1750–1812), of Scale Hall, near Lancaster in Lancashire, High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1774 and a Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire, Colonel of a regiment of Lancashire militia, by his wife Hon. Lucy Smith-Stanley (d.1833), the earl&#x27;s aunt and a daughter of James Smith-Stanley, Lord Strange (1716–1771). Charlotte&#x27;s brother was Edmund Hornby (1773–1857) of Dalton Hall, near Burton, Westmorland, a Member of Parliament for Preston, Lancashire, from 1812–1826, who married the earl&#x27;s sister Lady Charlotte Stanley (d.1805). 

By Charlotte Hornby, he had issue:
* Edward George Geoffrey Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby (1799–1869), thrice Prime Minister (1852, 1858–9, 1866–8)
* Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Smith-Stanley (11 July 1801 – 15 February 1853), married in 1823 Edward Penrhyn
* Hon. Henry Thomas Smith-Stanley (1803–1875), MP for Preston (1832–7)
* Hon. Emily Lucy Smith-Stanley (2 May – 15 November 1804), died in infancy
* Hon. Louisa Emily Stanley (1 June 1805 – 11 December 1825), married in June 1825 Lt.-Col. Samuel Long
* Lady Eleanor Mary Smith-Stanley (3 May 1807 – 11 September 1887), married in 1835 Rev. Frank George Hopwood, Rector of Winwick, Lancashire
* Colonel Hon. Charles James Fox Stanley (25 April 1808 – 13 October 1884), married in 1836 Frances Augusta, daughter of Gen. Sir Henry Frederick Campbell

He died on 30 June 1851 at his seat, Knowsley Hall.

<text>In mathematics the synchrotron functions are defined as follows (for &quot;x&quot; ≥ 0):

* First synchrotron function formula_1
* Second synchrotron function formula_2

where &quot;K&quot;&quot;j&quot; is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. 

== Use in astrophysics ==

In astrophysics, x is usually a ratio of frequencies, that is, the frequency over a critical frequency (critical frequency is the frequency at which most synchrotron radiation is radiated). This is needed when calculating the spectra for different types of synchrotron emission. It takes a spectrum of electrons (or any charged particle) generated by a separate process (such as a power law distribution of electrons and positrons from a constant injection spectrum) and converts this to the spectrum of photons generated by the input electrons/positrons.

<text>Slobozia () is the capital city of Ialomița County, Muntenia, Romania, with a population of 41,550 in 2021.

==Etymology==
Its name is from the Romanian &quot;slobozie&quot;, which meant a recently colonized village which was free of taxation. The word itself comes from the Slavic word &quot;slobod&quot; which means &quot;free&quot;. As it is located in the middle of flat land (Bărăgan Plain), it was very vulnerable to Tatar and Ottoman incursions. To encourage peasants to settle there, they were exempted from some taxes, hence the name.

==Geography==
Slobozia lies roughly in the middle of the county, on the banks of Ialomița River, at about east of Bucharest and west of Constanța, important port at the Black Sea. The city is within of the Bucharest-Constanța A2 Motorway (Autostrada Soarelui).

The total area of the municipality is . In the present administrative form, Slobozia consists of Slobozia proper and the neighbourhoods of Bora and Slobozia Nouă.

==Economy==
The main activity in the area is agriculture, processing of the agricultural products and light industry.

==Culture==

In 1990 the Cultural Centre was inaugurated, bearing the name of the conductor and composer Ionel Perlea, a city native. The building houses exhibition and performance rooms, bookstores, cultural institutions. In 1999 the Cultural Centre &quot;Ionel Perlea&quot; entered the UNESCO circuit.

The city is the headquarters of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Slobozia and Călărași, established in 1993.

==Demographics==
At the 2002 census, 97.6% of inhabitants were ethnic Romanians and 2.2% Roma. 98.6% were Romanian Orthodox, 0.4% Seventh-day Adventist and 0.2% Roman Catholic.

==Tourism==
The main tourist attraction consists of the nearby Lake Amara, situated away. Amara Resort is also a balneoclimateric resort. Access to Amara is by minibuses that leave every 15 minutes from the Slobozia Train Station. As part of a private tourist complex, there is a small copy of the Eiffel Tower high.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Slobozia is twinned with:
* Nanyang, China
* Razgrad, Bulgaria
* Silistra, Bulgaria
* Veles, North Macedonia

==Notable people== 
* Alin Badea (born 1988), sabre fencer
* Mihaela Bulică (born 1990), sabre fencer
* Mircea Dinescu (born 1950), poet, journalist, and editor

<doc id="406952" wikidata="Q1638777" url="?curid=406952" title="Hurwitz zeta function">
<text>In mathematics, the Hurwitz zeta function is one of the many zeta functions. It is formally defined for complex variables with and by

:formula_1

This series is absolutely convergent for the given values of and and can be extended to a meromorphic function defined for all . The Riemann zeta function is . The Hurwitz zeta function is named after Adolf Hurwitz, who introduced it in 1882.
 
==Integral representation==
The Hurwitz zeta function has an integral representation
:formula_2
for formula_3 and formula_4 (This integral can be viewed as a Mellin transform.) The formula can be obtained, roughly, by writing
:formula_5
and then interchanging the sum and integral.

The integral representation above can be converted to a contour integral representation
:formula_6
where formula_7 is a Hankel contour counterclockwise around the positive real axis, and the principal branch is used for the complex exponentiation formula_8. Unlike the previous integral, this integral is valid for all &quot;s&quot;, and indeed is an entire function of &quot;s&quot;.

The contour integral representation provides an analytic continuation of formula_9 to all formula_10. At formula_11, it has a simple pole with residue formula_12.

==Hurwitz&#x27;s formula==
The Hurwitz zeta function satisfies an identity which generalizes the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function:
:formula_13
valid for Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 1 and 0 &lt; &quot;a&quot; ≤ 1. The Riemann zeta functional equation is the special case &quot;a&quot; = 1:
:formula_14

Hurwitz&#x27;s formula can also be expressed as
:formula_15
(for Re(&quot;s&quot;) &lt; 0 and 0 &lt; &quot;a&quot; ≤ 1).

Hurwitz&#x27;s formula has a variety of different proofs. One proof uses the contour integration representation along with the residue theorem. A second proof uses a theta function identity, or equivalently Poisson summation. These proofs are analogous to the two proofs of the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function in Riemann&#x27;s 1859 paper. Another proof of the Hurwitz formula uses Euler–Maclaurin summation to express the Hurwitz zeta function as an integral
:formula_16
(−1 &lt; Re(&quot;s&quot;) &lt; 0 and 0 &lt; &quot;a&quot; ≤ 1) and then expanding the numerator as a Fourier series.

===Functional equation for rational &quot;a&quot;===
When &quot;a&quot; is a rational number, Hurwitz&#x27;s formula leads to the following functional equation: For integers formula_17,
:formula_18
holds for all values of &quot;s&quot;.

This functional equation can be written as another equivalent form:

formula_19.

==Some finite sums==
Closely related to the functional equation are the following finite sums, some of which may be evaluated in a closed form
:formula_20

:formula_21

:formula_22
where &quot;m&quot; is positive integer greater than 2 and &quot;s&quot; is complex, see e.g. Appendix B in.

==Series representation==
A convergent Newton series representation defined for (real) &quot;a&quot; &gt; 0 and any complex &quot;s&quot; ≠ 1 was given by Helmut Hasse in 1930:

:formula_23

This series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the &quot;s&quot;-plane to an entire function. The inner sum may be understood to be the &quot;n&quot;th forward difference of formula_24; that is,

:formula_25

where Δ is the forward difference operator. Thus, one may write:

:formula_26

==Taylor series==
The partial derivative of the zeta in the second argument is a shift:

:formula_27

Thus, the Taylor series can be written as:

:formula_28

Alternatively,

:formula_29

with formula_30.

Closely related is the Stark–Keiper formula:

:formula_31

which holds for integer &quot;N&quot; and arbitrary &quot;s&quot;. See also Faulhaber&#x27;s formula for a similar relation on finite sums of powers of integers.

==Laurent series==
The Laurent series expansion can be used to define generalized Stieltjes constants that occur in the series
:formula_32

In particular, the constant term is given by
:formula_33
where formula_34 is the gamma function and formula_35 is the digamma function. As a special case, formula_36.

==Discrete Fourier transform==
The discrete Fourier transform of the Hurwitz zeta function with respect to the order &quot;s&quot; is the Legendre chi function.

==Particular values==

===Negative integers===
The values of &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;, &quot;a&quot;) at &quot;s&quot; = 0, −1, −2, ... are related to the Bernoulli polynomials:
:formula_37
For example, the formula_38 case gives
:formula_39

===&quot;s&quot;-derivative===
The partial derivative with respect to &quot;s&quot; at &quot;s&quot; = 0 is related to the gamma function:
:formula_40
In particular, formula_41 The formula is due to Lerch.

==Relation to Jacobi theta function==
If formula_42 is the Jacobi theta function, then

:formula_43

holds for formula_44 and &quot;z&quot; complex, but not an integer. For &quot;z&quot;=&quot;n&quot; an integer, this simplifies to

:formula_45

where ζ here is the Riemann zeta function. Note that this latter form is the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function, as originally given by Riemann. The distinction based on &quot;z&quot; being an integer or not accounts for the fact that the Jacobi theta function converges to the periodic delta function, or Dirac comb in &quot;z&quot; as formula_46.

==Relation to Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions==
At rational arguments the Hurwitz zeta function may be expressed as a linear combination of Dirichlet L-functions and vice versa: The Hurwitz zeta function coincides with Riemann&#x27;s zeta function ζ(&quot;s&quot;) when &quot;a&quot; = 1, when &quot;a&quot; = 1/2 it is equal to (2&quot;s&quot;−1)ζ(&quot;s&quot;), and if &quot;a&quot; = &quot;n&quot;/&quot;k&quot; with &quot;k&quot; &gt; 2, (&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) &gt; 1 and 0 &lt; &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot;, then

:formula_47

the sum running over all Dirichlet characters mod &quot;k&quot;. In the opposite direction we have the linear combination

:formula_48

There is also the multiplication theorem

:formula_49

of which a useful generalization is the &quot;distribution relation&quot;

:formula_50

(This last form is valid whenever &quot;q&quot; a natural number and 1 − &quot;qa&quot; is not.)

==Zeros==
If &quot;a&quot;=1 the Hurwitz zeta function reduces to the Riemann zeta function itself; if &quot;a&quot;=1/2 it reduces to the Riemann zeta function multiplied by a simple function of the complex argument &quot;s&quot; (&quot;vide supra&quot;), leading in each case to the difficult study of the zeros of Riemann&#x27;s zeta function. In particular, there will be no zeros with real part greater than or equal to 1. However, if 0&lt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;1 and &quot;a&quot;≠1/2, then there are zeros of Hurwitz&#x27;s zeta function in the strip 1&lt;Re(&quot;s&quot;)&lt;1+ε for any positive real number ε. This was proved by Davenport and Heilbronn for rational or transcendental irrational &quot;a&quot;, and by Cassels for algebraic irrational &quot;a&quot;.

==Rational values==
The Hurwitz zeta function occurs in a number of striking identities at rational values. In particular, values in terms of the Euler polynomials formula_51:

:formula_52

and

:formula_53

One also has

:formula_54

which holds for formula_55. Here, the formula_56 and formula_57 are defined by means of the Legendre chi function formula_58 as

:formula_59

and

:formula_60

For integer values of ν, these may be expressed in terms of the Euler polynomials. These relations may be derived by employing the functional equation together with Hurwitz&#x27;s formula, given above.

==Applications==
Hurwitz&#x27;s zeta function occurs in a variety of disciplines. Most commonly, it occurs in number theory, where its theory is the deepest and most developed. However, it also occurs in the study of fractals and dynamical systems. In applied statistics, it occurs in Zipf&#x27;s law and the Zipf–Mandelbrot law. In particle physics, it occurs in a formula by Julian Schwinger, giving an exact result for the pair production rate of a Dirac electron in a uniform electric field.

==Special cases and generalizations==
The Hurwitz zeta function with a positive integer &quot;m&quot; is related to the polygamma function:
:formula_61

The Barnes zeta function generalizes the Hurwitz zeta function.

The Lerch transcendent generalizes the Hurwitz zeta:
:formula_62
and thus
:formula_63

Hypergeometric function

:formula_64 where formula_65

Meijer G-function

:formula_66

<doc id="406959" wikidata="Q3175877" url="?curid=406959" title="Coil spring">
<text>A coil spring is a mechanical device that typically is used to store energy and subsequently release it, to absorb shock, or to maintain a force between contacting surfaces. It is made of an elastic material formed into the shape of a helix that returns to its natural length when unloaded.

Under tension or compression, the material (wire) of a coil spring undergoes torsion. The spring characteristics therefore depend on the shear modulus.

A coil spring may also be used as a torsion spring: in this case the spring as a whole is subjected to torsion about its helical axis. The material of the spring is thereby subjected to a bending moment, either reducing or increasing the helical radius. In this mode, it is the Young&#x27;s modulus of the material that determines the spring characteristics.

== Spring rate ==
Spring rate is the measurement of how much a coil spring can hold until it compresses . The spring rate is normally specified by the manufacture. If a spring has a rate of 100 then the spring would compress 1 inch with of load.

== Variants ==
Types of coil spring are:

* Tension/extension coil springs, designed to resist stretching. They usually have a hook or eye form at each end for attachment.
* Compression coil springs, designed to resist being compressed. A typical use for compression coil springs is in car suspension systems.
** Volute springs are used as heavy load compression springs. A strip of plate is rolled into the shape of both a helix and a spiral. When compressed, the strip is stiffer edge-on than a wire coil, but the spiral arrangement allows the turns to overlap rather than bottoming out on each other.
**Arc springs (bow springs) are a special form of coil spring which was originally developed for use in the dual-mass flywheel of internal combustion engine drive trains. The force is applied through the ends of the spring. A torque formula_1 can be transmitted around an axis via the force formula_2 directed along this helical axis and the lever arm to the system center point formula_3.
* Torsion springs, designed to resist twisting actions. Often associated to clothes pegs or up-and-over garage doors.

== Applications ==
Coil springs have many applications; notable ones include:

* Buckling springs in computer keyboards
* Mattress coils in innerspring mattresses
* Upholstery coil springs in upholstery

Coil springs are commonly used in vehicle suspension. These springs are compression springs and can differ greatly in strength and in size depending on application. A coil spring suspension can be stiff to soft depending on the vehicle it is used on. Coil spring can be either mounted with a shock absorber or mounted separately. Coil springs in trucks allow them to ride smoothly when unloaded and once loaded the spring compresses and becomes stiff. This allows the vehicle to bounce less when loaded. Coil spring suspension is also used in high performance cars so that the car can absorb bumps and have low body roll. In off-road vehicles they are used because of their range of travel they allow at the wheel.

Coil springs used in the engine are compression springs and play an important role in closing the valves that feed air and let exhaust gasses out of the combustion chamber. The spring is attached to a rocker that is connected to the valve.

Tension and extension coil springs of a given material, wire diameter and coil diameter exert the same force when fully loaded; increased number of coils merely (linearly) increases free length and compressed/extended length.

== Manufacture ==

Metal coil springs are made by winding a wire around a shaped former a cylinder is used to form cylindrical coil springs.

Coil springs for vehicles are typically made of hardened steel. A machine called an auto-coiler takes spring wire that has been heated so it can easily be shaped. It is then fed onto a lathe that has a metal rod with the desired coil spring size. The machine takes the wire and guides it onto the spinning rod as well as pushing it across the rod to form multiple coils. The spring is then ejected from the machine and an operator will put it in oil to cool off. The spring is then tempered to lose the brittleness from being cooled. The coil size and strength can be controlled by the lathe rod size and material used. Different alloys are used to get certain characteristics out of the spring, such as stiffness, dampening and strength

<text>The City of San Marino (), also known simply as San Marino and locally as Città, is the capital city of the Republic of San Marino and one of its nine . It has a population of 4,061. It is on the western slopes of San Marino&#x27;s highest point, Monte Titano. It is also the fifth-least-populated national capital in the world.

==Geography==
The City of San Marino borders the of Acquaviva, Borgo Maggiore, Fiorentino, and Chiesanuova and the Italian municipality of San Leo.

The City of San Marino contains seven : Cà Berlone, Canepa, Casole, Castellaro, Montalbo, Murata, and Santa Mustiola.

The International Academy of Sciences San Marino was centered here.

==History==

The city is claimed to be founded by Saint Marinus and several Christian refugees fleeing from Roman persecution in the year 301.

The urban heart of the city was protected by three towers: the first, Guaita, built in the 11th century, held a reputation for being impenetrable which to a great extent discouraged attacks.

Tensions with bordering powers urged the necessity to build a second tower, Cesta (13th century). The defensive system was not completed until the construction of a third tower, the Montale (14th century) - the smallest of all and constructed on the last of the summits of Monte Titano.

With the population of the city increasing, the territory of the country was extended by a few square kilometers. Since the Sammarinese policy was not to invade or to use war to obtain new territories, it was by means of purchases and treaties that San Marino obtained the other eight &quot;castelli&quot; which make up the country.

==Economy==
The economy of the city of San Marino has always been closely bound to that of the country. Until recently, the main economic activities of the locality were stone extraction and carving. Today, there is a more varied economy, including tourism, commerce, sale of postage stamps, and a small agricultural industry, although the latter is in decline.

===Landmarks===

The city is visited by more than three million people per year, and has developed progressively as a tourist centre. Of the tourists, 85% are Italian. There are also more than a thousand retail outlets, where one can find a great variety of products.

====Main sights====
*Basilica di San Marino
* Palazzo dei Capitani
* Palazzo Pubblico
* Teatro Titano
* The Three Towers of San Marino
* Piazza del Titano
* Piazza Garibaldi
* Monastery of Santa Clara
* Grand Hotel San Marino

== Transport ==
The city is known for its long, winding cobblestoned streets, as its altitude and steep approach put it beyond the reach of the San Marino Highway. San Marino is also notable in that cars are prohibited in much of the city center. A series of lifts connects the upper part of city with the lower.

City of San Marino is the top terminus of the Funivia di San Marino, an aerial cablecar system that connects the city to Borgo Maggiore. Running every fifteen minutes, the two-minute ride is renowned for its panoramic views over San Marino, the Province of Rimini, and the Adriatic Sea. The City of San Marino terminus is located at the turn of Contrada Omagnano with Contrada del Pianello, at the historic city centre&#x27;s northern end, next to the and less than from the Basilica of San Marino and the Piazza della Libertà.

The City of San Marino is the terminus of seven of San Marino&#x27;s eight bus lines, which run to other settlements in the country. Additionally, the central bus stop in Piazzale Marino Calcigni is the terminus of a regular coach connection to Rimini, operated by coach companies Bonelli and Benedettini.

Between 1932 and 1944, a electrified narrow gauge railway operated between Rimini and the City of San Marino. During the Second World War, the line was bombed and closed, after which its tunnels sheltered refugees during the Battles of Rimini and San Marino. After the war, the railway was abandoned in favour of the San Marino Highway.

In 2012, an section was reopened as a heritage railway in the City of San Marino, running between Piazzale della Stazione and near Via Napoleone. The restored section comprises the original railway&#x27;s final horseshoe turn through the Montale tunnel.

==Sport==
The city of San Marino has three football teams: the S.S. Murata, the S.P. Tre Penne and the San Marino Academy. The city had the Olympic Flame pass through San Marino during the run-up to the 2006 Winter Olympics.

==International relations==
City of San Marino is twinned with: 
* Rab, Croatia (1968) 
* San Leo, Italy (1995) 
* Nanjing, China (2021)

<text>Štefan Banič (; 23 November 1870 – 2 January 1941) was a Slovak inventor who patented an early parachute design.

Born in Jánostelek (&quot;, Smolenická Nová Ves&quot;), Austria-Hungary (now Smolenická Nová Ves, a part of Smolenice, Slovakia), Banič immigrated to the United States and worked as a coal miner in Greenville, Pennsylvania. After witnessing a plane crash in 1912, Banič constructed a prototype of a parachute, and on August 25, 1914 was granted US patent, No. 1,108,484.

The design which was radically different from others – it was a type of umbrella attached to the body, but it is claimed that he successfully tested it in Washington, D.C. jumping first from a 15-story building and subsequently from an airplane in 1914. He sold his patent to the U.S. Army, although there is no evidence that it was ever used.

After World War I Banič returned to Czechoslovakia where he helped to explore the Driny karst cave in the foothills of the Little Carpathian Mountains, close to his hometown of Smolenice.

==Legacy==
In 1997, US skydiver Slavo Mulik, also born in Slovakia, created the Stefan Banic Parachute Foundation which offers bronze, silver and gold medal awards to individuals involved in events, promotions and/or celebrations of skydiving, in memory of Banic.

In 2006, Slovak military paratroopers installed a memorial plaque at his birthplace in Smolenice.

In 2020, Slovakia issued a €10 silver coin depicting Banič.

Trnava – Boleráz airport, near Smolenice, carries Banič&#x27;s name.

<doc id="406972" wikidata="Q7097354" url="?curid=406972" title="Operation Ore">
<text>Operation Ore was a British police operation that commenced in 1999 following information received from US law enforcement, which was intended to prosecute thousands of users of a website reportedly featuring child pornography. It was the United Kingdom&#x27;s biggest ever computer crime investigation, leading to 7,250 suspects identified, 4,283 homes searched, 3,744 arrests, 1,848 charged, 1,451 convictions, 493 cautioned and 140 children removed from suspected dangerous situations and an estimated 33 suicides. Operation Ore identified and prosecuted some sex offenders, but the validity of the police procedures was later questioned, as errors in the investigations resulted in many false arrests.

Operation Ore followed a similar crackdown in the United States, called Operation Avalanche; in the US, 100 people were charged from the 35,000 US access records available. In total, 390,000 individuals in over 60 countries were found to have accessed material in the combined investigations.

==US investigation==

Between 1999 and 2001, after a tip, a US investigation was conducted into Landslide Productions Inc., a Texas-based online pornography portal operated by Thomas and Janice Reedy. The portal was found to have provided access to child pornography, and the Reedys were both convicted of trafficking child pornography in August 2001.

Following the investigation and conviction, &quot;Operation Avalanche&quot; was launched in the US to trace and prosecute child pornography users identified in the Landslide database. In addition, the website was run for a short time as part of a sting operation by the FBI to capture new suspects. The FBI also passed identities from the Landslide database to the police organisations of other countries, including 7,272 names to the UK.

==Operation Ore==
In May 2002, Operation Ore was implemented in the UK to investigate and prosecute the Landslide users whose names were provided by the FBI. Those under investigation were reported by Rebecca Smithers of &quot;The Guardian&quot; to include government ministers, MPs, and judges.
The charge of possession of child pornography was used where evidence was found, but the lesser charge of incitement was used in those cases where a user&#x27;s details were on the Landslide database but no images were found on the suspect&#x27;s computer or in their home. Because of the number of names on the FBI list, the scale of the investigation in the UK was overwhelming for the police, who appealed to the government for emergency funding for the case. Reportedly, several million pounds were spent on the investigations, and complaints mounted that other investigations were put at risk because of the diversion of the resources of child protection units into the case.

Information from the Operation Ore list of names was leaked to the press early in 2003. After obtaining the list, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; stated that it included the names of a number of prominent individuals, some of which were later published by the press. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the list included at least twenty senior executives, a senior teacher at a girls&#x27; public school, personnel from military bases, GPs, university academics, and civil servants, a famous newspaper columnist, a songwriter for a pop band, a member of a chart-topping 1980s cult pop group, and an official with the Church of England. An investigation followed the leak, and police complained that the advance warning would allow suspected paedophiles to dispose of evidence. A police officer was reported to have lost his job for leaking the names.

==Legal challenges==

After 2003, Operation Ore came under closer scrutiny, with police forces in the UK being criticised for their handling of the operation. The most common criticism was that they failed to determine whether or not the owners of credit cards in Landslide&#x27;s database actually accessed any sites containing child porn, unlike in the US, where it was determined in advance whether or not credit card subscribers had purchased child porn. Investigative journalist Duncan Campbell exposed these flaws in a series of articles in 2005 and 2007.

Many of the charges at the Landslide-affiliated sites were made using stolen credit card information, and the police arrested the real owners of the credit cards, not the viewers. Thousands of credit card charges were made where there was no access to a site or access only to a dummy site. When the police checked, seven years after Operation Ore commenced, they found 54,348 occurrences of stolen credit card information in the Landslide database. The British police failed to provide this information to the defendants and, in some cases, implied that they had checked and found no evidence of credit card fraud when no such check had been done. Because of the nature of the charges, children were removed from the homes immediately. In the two years it took the police to determine that thousands had been falsely accused, over 100 children had been removed from their homes and denied any unsupervised time with their fathers. The arrests also led to an estimated 33 suicides by 2007.

One man was charged when the sole &quot;suspicious&quot; image in his possession was of young-looking—but adult—actress Melissa Ashley. Also arrested were Massive Attack&#x27;s Robert Del Naja (later cleared) and The Who&#x27;s guitarist Pete Townshend, who was cautioned by the police after acknowledging credit card access to the Landslide website. Duncan Campbell later stated in &quot;PC Pro&quot; magazine that their credit card charges and IP addresses were traced through the Landslide site, and both were found to have accessed sites which had nothing to do with child pornography. The actor and writer Chris Langham was among those convicted.

Independent investigators later obtained both the database records and video of the Landslide raid. When this information was presented in a UK court, Michael Mead of the United States Postal Service contradicted his US testimony under oath regarding several details relating to the investigation. As a result of the errors exposed in the cases, some people arrested in Operation Ore filed a group action lawsuit in 2006 against the detectives behind Operation Ore, alleging false arrest.

After Campbell&#x27;s articles appeared, the independent computer expert Jim Bates, who analysed the hard drives, was charged and convicted of four counts of making false statements and one count of perjury regarding his qualifications and barred from appearing as an expert witness. Bates&#x27;s judgement has been called into question on other matters. Bates was later arrested for possession of indecent images during his Operation Ore investigations. The search of Bates&#x27; home was ruled unlawful, as the police had applied for the search warrant using the wrong section of PACE and were unable to examine any of the material seized from his house.

CEOP and its chief executive, Jim Gamble, were accused of using vague terms which do not have a recognised meaning within either child protection or law enforcement when they defended the operation.

On 6 December 2010, senior Court of Appeal judges rejected the appeal of Anthony O&#x27;Shea, stating that they were &quot;entirely confident that the appellant was rightly convicted.&quot; The judgement states in relation to the appellant&#x27;s assertions regarding the claim that his IP address had been disguised: &quot;These suggestions are fanciful in the extreme. The appellant&#x27;s theory (for it is no more than such) that he [Mr O&#x27;Shea] was the victim of the machinations of a fraudulent webmaster is, in our view, pure speculation.&quot; Jim Bates, an expert witness and critic of Operation Ore, was criticised for misleading comments during the hearing. The appeal had been considered to be a landmark case where success could have led to many of the other convictions achieved as a result of Ore being overturned.

<text>Operation Pin is an initiative of the Virtual Global Taskforce, which consists of the UK&#x27;s National Crime Squad, the FBI, Interpol, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Australian Hi-Tech Crime Centre/Australian Federal Police (AFP). Its stated aim is to identify pedophiles and other people who are using the internet to access child pornography. Announced on 18 December 2003, the operation is said to involve the creation and operation of a number of websites (so-called &quot;honeypots&quot;) purporting to offer illegal images. While these websites will not contain child pornography images, they will be designed to look like the real thing so as to ensnare as many offenders as possible.

The websites will present visitors with a variety of options which, instead of leading to illegal images, lead to a law enforcement site that will inform them that their personal details have been recorded and that they have committed a crime. They will also be given details of appropriate helplines. It is unclear if the information recorded will be technical (for example, an IP address) or personal (for example, credit card details).

The stated purpose of Operation Pin is to cause people seeking out child pornography on the Internet to wonder whether they will find an illegal site or one operated by law enforcement agencies. It can thus be understood as a kind of deterrence.

<doc id="406981" wikidata="Q683814" url="?curid=406981" title="Codex Leicester">
<text>The Codex Leicester (also briefly known as the Codex Hammer) is a collection of scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci. The codex is named after Thomas Coke, Earl of Leicester, who purchased it in 1719. The codex provides an insight into the mind of the Renaissance artist, scientist and thinker, as well as an exceptional illustration of the link between art and science and the creativity of the scientific process.

When the manuscript was last sold to Bill Gates at Christie&#x27;s auction house on 11 November 1994 in New York for (equivalent to $ million in ), it was the most expensive manuscript ever sold.

==Manuscript==
The leather-bound notebook comprises 36 sheets, 29 × 22 cm. The manuscript is not a single linear script but a mixture of Leonardo&#x27;s observations and theories on astronomy and the properties of water, rocks, fossils, air, and celestial light. The topics addressed include:

* An explanation of why fossils of sea creatures can be found on mountains. Hundreds of years before plate tectonics became accepted scientific theory, Leonardo believed that mountains had previously formed sea beds, which were gradually lifted until they formed mountains.
* The movement of water. This is the main topic of the Codex Leicester. Among other things, Leonardo wrote about the flow of water in rivers and how it is affected by different obstacles put in its way. He made recommendations about bridge construction and erosion from his observations.
* The luminosity of the Moon. Leonardo speculated that the Moon&#x27;s surface is covered by water, reflecting the Sun&#x27;s light. In this model, waves on the water&#x27;s surface cause the light to be reflected in many directions, explaining why the Moon is not as bright as the Sun. Leonardo explained that the pale glow on the dark portion of the crescent Moon is caused by sunlight reflected from the Earth. Thus, he described the phenomenon of planetshine one hundred years before the German astronomer Johannes Kepler proved it.

The codex consists of 18 sheets of paper, each folded in half and written on both sides, forming the complete 72-page document. At one time the sheets were bound together, but they are now displayed separately. It was handwritten in Italian by Leonardo, using his characteristic mirror writing, and supported by copious drawings and diagrams.

== History ==

=== Historical owners ===
* Guglielmo della Porta, Michelangelo&#x27;s student (?)
* Giuseppe Ghezzi (until 1719)
* Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (1719–1759)
* Leicester estate (1759–1980)

=== Codex Hammer ===
The codex was purchased at auction from the Leicester estate in 1980 by the wealthy industrialist and art collector Armand Hammer, for $5.1 million (equivalent to $ million in ); he later renamed the notebook the Codex Hammer. Hammer commissioned Leonardo da Vinci scholar Carlo Pedretti to compile the loose pages of the codex back into its original form. Over the next seven years, Pedretti translated each page to English, completing the project in 1987.

=== Bill Gates ===
The codex was sold to Bill Gates by Christie&#x27;s auction house on 11 November 1994 in New York for . Until 2021, the codex remained the most expensive book ever sold.

After Gates acquired the codex, he had its pages scanned into digital image files, some of which were later distributed as screensaver and wallpaper files on a CD-ROM as part of a Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 desktop theme, which would later be included with Windows 98 and Windows ME. A comprehensive CD-ROM version (titled &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;) was released by Corbis in 1997.

The Codex Leicester has been unbound, with each page individually mounted between glass panes. It is on public display once a year in a different city worldwide. In 2000, it was displayed at Sydney&#x27;s Powerhouse Museum. In 2004, it was exhibited in the Château de Chambord, and 2005 in Tokyo. One page was exhibited at the Seattle Museum of Flight&#x27;s 2006 exhibit &quot;Leonardo da Vinci: Man, Inventor, Genius&quot;. From June to August 2007, the codex was the centerpiece of a two-month exhibition hosted by the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin. The codex was on view at the Phoenix Art Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, from 24 January 2015 to 12 April 2015 for the exhibition &quot;Leonardo Da Vinci&#x27;s Codex Leicester and the Power of Observation&quot;. Its presentation at the Phoenix Art Museum was the first time a work by Leonardo was displayed in Arizona. The codex was then on view at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in an exhibition &quot;Leonardo Da Vinci, the Codex Leicester, and the Creative Mind&quot; that opened 21 June 2015, where it remained on display until 30 August 2015. As part of the same tour, the Codex Leicester was also on display at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, North Carolina from 31 October 2015 to 17 January 2016.

For the 500th anniversary of Leonardo&#x27;s death, the Codex Leicester was on display from 29 October 2018 to 20 January 2019 in Florence at the Aula Magliabechiana of the Uffizi.

<doc id="406983" wikidata="Q362435" url="?curid=406983" title="Jim Reeves">
<text>James Travis Reeves (August 20, 1923July 31, 1964) was an American country and popular music singer and songwriter. With records charting from the 1950s to the 1980s, he became well known as a practitioner of the Nashville Sound. Known as &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot;, his songs continued to chart for years after his death in a plane crash. He is a member of both the Country Music and Texas Country Music Halls of Fame.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Reeves was born at home in Galloway, Texas, a small rural community near Carthage. He was the youngest of eight children born to Thomas Middleton Reeves (1882-1924) and Mary Beulah Adams Reeves (1884-1980). He was known as Travis during his childhood years. Winning an athletic scholarship to the University of Texas, he enrolled to study speech and drama but quit after only six weeks to work in the shipyards in Houston. Soon he resumed baseball, playing in the semi-professional leagues before contracting with the St. Louis Cardinals &quot;farm&quot; team during 1944 as a right-handed pitcher. He played for the minor leagues for three years before severing his sciatic nerve while pitching, which ended his athletic career.

===Early career===
Reeves&#x27; initial efforts to pursue a baseball career were sporadic, possibly due to his uncertainty as to whether he would be drafted into the military as World War II enveloped the United States. On March 9, 1943, he reported to the Army Induction Center in Tyler, Texas for his preliminary physical examination. However, he failed the exam (probably due to a heart irregularity), and on 4 August 1943 an official letter declared his 4-F draft status.
Reeves began to work as a radio announcer and sang live between songs. During the late 1940s, he was contracted with a couple of small Texas-based recording companies, but without success. Reeves at this point was influenced by early country and western swing artists including Jimmie Rodgers and Moon Mullican, as well as popular singers Bing Crosby, Eddy Arnold and Frank Sinatra. In the late 1940s, Reeves joined Moon Mullican&#x27;s band, and as a solo artist, Reeves recorded Mullican-style songs including &quot;Each Beat of my Heart&quot; and &quot;My Heart&#x27;s Like a Welcome Mat&quot; in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

During these years, Reeves took a job as an announcer for KWKH-AM in Shreveport, Louisiana, then the home of the popular radio program &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;. According to former &quot;Hayride&quot; master of ceremonies Frank Page, who had introduced Elvis Presley on the program in 1954, singer Sleepy LaBeef was late for a performance, and Reeves was asked to substitute. (Other accounts—including that of Reeves himself, in an interview on the RCA Victor album &quot;Yours Sincerely&quot;—name Hank Williams as the absentee.)

===Initial success in the 1950s===
Jim Reeves was a country music singer who had success early on in his career, first with the song &quot;Mexican Joe&quot; in 1953 for Abbott Records. Other hits followed, such as &quot;I Love You&quot; (a duet with Ginny Wright), and &quot;Bimbo&quot; which reached number one on the U.S. country charts in 1954. In addition to those early hits, Reeves recorded many other songs for Fabor Records and Abbott Records. In 1954, Abbott Records released a 45 single with &quot;Bimbo&quot; on side-A which hit number one and featured Little Joe Hunt of the Arkansas Walk of Fame. Jim Reeves and Little Joe Hunt met at the Louisiana Hayride, which was Louisiana&#x27;s equivalent to Nashville&#x27;s Grand Ole Opry. After performing at the Hayride in Shreveport, Reeves and Hunt traveled and performed together for several years in the dance halls and clubs of East Texas and rural Arkansas. Reeves became the headliner with Hunt as the backup performer. Due to his growing popularity, Reeves went on to release his first album in November 1955, &quot;Jim Reeves Sings&quot; (Abbott 5001), which proved to be one of Abbott Records&#x27; few album releases. Reeves&#x27; star was on the rise because he had already been signed to a 10-year recording contract with RCA Victor by Steve Sholes. Sholes went on to produce some of Reeves&#x27; first recordings at RCA Victor. Sholes signed another performer from the Louisiana Hayride that same year (1955), Elvis Presley. Most of the talented performers of the 1950s such as Reeves, Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Jim Ed Brown, Maxine Brown, the Wilburn Brothers, and Little Joe Hunt got their start at the Louisiana Hayride. In addition to the Hayride, Jim Reeves joined the Grand Ole Opry, also in 1955. Reeves also made his first appearance on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; in 1955. He was such a hit with the fans that he was invited to act as fill-in host from May thru July 1958 on the popular program, &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;.

From his earliest recordings with RCA Victor, Reeves relied on the loud, East Texas style, which was considered standard for country and western performers of that time, but he developed a new style of singing over the course of his career. He said, &quot;One of these days...I&#x27;m gonna sing like I want to sing!&quot; So, he decreased his volume and used the lower registers of his singing voice, with his lips nearly touching the microphone. Amid protests from RCA, but with the endorsement of his producer Chet Atkins, Reeves used this new style in a 1957 recording, a demonstration song of lost love that had originally been intended for a female voice. It was titled &quot;Four Walls&quot;, which not only scored number one on the country music charts, but also scored number 11 on the popular music charts, as well. This recording marked his transition from novelty songs to serious country-pop music, and according to one source, &quot;established Reeves as a country balladeer&quot;. &quot;Four Walls&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;ll Have to Go&quot; (1959) defined Reeves&#x27; style.

Reeves was instrumental in creating a new style of country music that used violins and lusher background arrangements that soon became known as the Nashville Sound. This new sound was able to cross genres, which made Reeves even more popular as a recording artist.

Reeves became known as a crooner because of his light yet rich baritone voice. Because of his vocal style, he was also considered a talented artist because of his versatility in crossing the music charts. He appealed to audiences that were not necessarily country/western. His catalog of songs such as &quot;Adios Amigo&quot;, &quot;Welcome to My World&quot;, and &quot;Am I Losing You?&quot; demonstrated this appeal. Many of his Christmas songs have become perennial favorites, including &quot;C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S&quot;, &quot;Blue Christmas&quot;, and &quot;An Old Christmas Card&quot;.

Between 1957 and 1958, Reeves was the host of a radio show on the ABC network. Debuting on October 7, 1957, the program was broadcast weekdays from 1 to 2 p.m. from Nashville, Tennessee. It featured the Anita Kerr Singers and Owen Bradley&#x27;s orchestra. This was also when he began shifting from cowboy outfits to sports jackets.

Reeves is also responsible for popularizing many gospel songs, including &quot;We Thank Thee&quot;, &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot;, &quot;Across the Bridge&quot;, and &quot;Where We&#x27;ll Never Grow Old&quot;. He was given the nickname Gentleman Jim, an apt description of his character both on stage and off.

===Early 1960s and international fame===
Reeves scored his greatest success with the Joe Allison composition &quot;He&#x27;ll Have to Go&quot;, a success on both the popular and country music charts, which earned him a platinum record. Released during late 1959, it scored number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Country Songs chart on February 8, 1960, which it scored for 14 consecutive weeks. Country music historian Bill Malone noted that while it was in many ways a conventional country song, its arrangement and the vocal chorus &quot;put this recording in the country-pop vein&quot;. In addition, Malone lauded Reeves&#x27; vocal styling—lowered to &quot;its natural resonant level&quot; to project the &quot;caressing style that became famous&quot;—as to why &quot;many people refer to him as the singer with the velvet voice.&quot; In 1963, he released his &quot;Twelve Songs of Christmas&quot; album, which had the well-known songs &quot;C.H.R.I.S.T.M.A.S&quot; and &quot;An Old Christmas Card&quot;. 
During 1975, RCA Victor producer Chet Atkins told interviewer Wayne Forsythe, &quot;Jim wanted to be a tenor, but I wanted him to be a baritone... I was right, of course. After he changed his voice to that smooth, deeper sound, he was immensely popular.&quot;

Reeves&#x27; international popularity during the 1960s, surpassing his popularity in the United States at times, helped to give country music a worldwide market for the first time. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Reeves’ star shone equally bright overseas in the United Kingdom, India, Germany, and even South Africa. Jim Reeves was hugely popular in Sri Lanka in the 1960s and 1970s and presently he is the most popular English language singer in Sri Lanka.

====South Africa====
During the early 1960s, Reeves was more popular in South Africa than Elvis Presley, and recorded several albums in the Afrikaans language. In 1963, he toured and starred in a South African film, &quot;Kimberley Jim&quot;. In the film, he sang part of one song in Afrikaans. The film was released with a special prologue and epilogue in South African cinemas after Reeves&#x27; death, praising him as a true friend of the country. The film was produced, directed, and written by Emil Nofal. Reeves later said that he enjoyed the film-making experience and would consider devoting more of his career to this medium. The film was released in South Africa (and also in the US) in 1965 after Reeves&#x27;s death.

Reeves was one of an exclusive trio of performers to have released an album there that played at the little-used 16⅔ rpm speed. This unusual format was more suited to the spoken word and was quickly discontinued for music. The only other artists known to have released such albums in South Africa were Elvis Presley and Slim Whitman.

====Britain and Ireland====
Reeves toured Britain and Ireland during 1963, between his tours of South Africa and Europe. Reeves and the Blue Boys were in Ireland from May 30 to June 19, 1963, with a tour of US military bases from June 10 to 15, when they returned to Ireland. They performed in most counties in Ireland, though Reeves occasionally abbreviated performances because he was unhappy with the available pianos at concert venues. In a June 6, 1963 interview with &quot;Spotlight&quot; magazine, Reeves expressed his concerns about the tour schedule and the condition of the pianos, but said he was pleased with the audiences.

A press reception for him at the Shannon Shamrock Inn was organized by Tom Monaghan of Bunratty Castle, County Clare. Showband singers Maisie McDaniel and Dermot O&#x27;Brien welcomed him on May 29, 1963. A photograph appeared in the &quot;Limerick Leader&quot; on June 1, 1963. Press coverage continued from May until Reeves&#x27; arrival with a photograph of the press reception in &quot;The Irish Press&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in the US also reported the tour before and after. The single &quot;Welcome to My World&quot; with the B/W side &quot;Juanita&quot; was released by RCA Victor during June 1963 and bought by the distributors Irish Records Factors Ltd. This scored the record number one while Reeves was there during June.

A number of accounts of his dances were given in the local newspapers, with a good one in &quot;The Kilkenny People&quot; of his dance in the Mayfair Ballroom, where 1,700 people were present. A photograph in &quot;The Donegal Democrat&quot; had Reeves&#x27; singing in the Pavesi Ball Room on June 7, 1963, and an account of his nonappearance on stage in &quot;The Diamond&quot;, Kiltimagh, County Mayo in &quot;The Western People&quot; representing how the tour went in different areas.

He planned to record an album of popular Irish songs, and had three number-one songs in Ireland during 1963 and 1964: &quot;Welcome to My World&quot;, &quot;I Love You Because&quot;, and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Forget You&quot;. The last two are estimated to have sold 860,000 and 750,000, respectively, in Britain alone, excluding Ireland. Reeves had 11 songs in the Irish charts from 1962 to 1967. He recorded two ballads, &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and &quot;Maureen&quot;. &quot;He&#x27;ll Have to Go&quot; was his most popular song there and was at number one and on the charts for months. He was one of the most popular recording artists in Ireland, in the first 10 after the Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Cliff Richard.

He was permitted to perform in Ireland by the Irish Federation of Musicians on the condition that he share the bill with Irish show bands, becoming popular by 1963. The British Musicians&#x27; Union would not permit him to perform there, because no agreement existed for British show bands to travel to America, in exchange for the Blue Boys playing in Britain. Reeves did, however, perform for British radio and TV programmes.

During the 1960s, at the early stage of his career, Elton John performed at various pubs in England, frequently playing songs by Reeves.

====Norway====
Reeves played at the sports arena Njårdhallen, Oslo, on April 15, 1964, with Bobby Bare, Chet Atkins, the Blue Boys, and the Anita Kerr Singers. They performed two concerts; the second was televised and recorded by Norwegian network NRK (Norsk Rikskringkasting, the only one in Norway at the time). The complete concert, however, was not recorded, including some of Reeves&#x27; last songs. He reportedly performed &quot;You&#x27;re the Only Good Thing (That&#x27;s Happened to Me)&quot; in this section. The program has been repeated on NRK several times over the years.

His first success in Norway, &quot;He&#x27;ll Have to Go&quot;, scored number one in the top 10 and scored the chart for 29 weeks. &quot;I Love You Because&quot; was his greatest success in Norway, scoring number one during 1964 and on the list for 39 weeks. His albums spent 696 weeks in the Norwegian top-20 chart, making him one of the most popular music artists in the history of Norway.

===Last recording session===
Reeves&#x27; last two recording sessions for RCA Victor were held July 2, 1964; they produced the songs &quot;Make the World Go Away&quot;, &quot;Missing You&quot;, and &quot;Is It Really Over?&quot; When the session ended with some time remaining on the schedule, Reeves suggested that he should record one more song. He taped &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, in what was to be his final RCA recording.

Reeves made one later recording, however, at the little studio in his home. In late July 1964, a few days before his death in an airplane crash, Reeves recorded &quot;I&#x27;m a Hit Again&quot;, using just an acoustic guitar as accompaniment. That recording was never officially released by RCA Victor (because it was a home recording not owned by the label), but appeared during 2003 as part of a collection of previously unissued Reeves songs released on the VoiceMasters label.

===Personal life===
Jim Reeves married Mary White on September 3, 1947. They never had any children, as Jim Reeves was believed to be sterile, (though not 100% proven) due to complications from a mumps infection.

===Death===
On July 31, 1964, Reeves and his business partner and manager Dean Manuel (also the pianist of Reeves&#x27;s backing group, the Blue Boys) left Batesville, Arkansas, en route to Nashville in a single-engine Beechcraft Debonair aircraft, N8972M, with Reeves at the controls. The two had secured a deal on some real estate.

While flying over Brentwood, Tennessee, they approached a violent thunderstorm. A subsequent investigation showed that once the small airplane became caught in the storm Reeves suffered spatial disorientation. The singer&#x27;s widow, Mary Reeves (1929–1999), probably unwittingly started the rumor that he was flying the airplane upside down and assumed he was increasing altitude to clear the storm. However, according to Larry Jordan, author of the 2011 biography, &quot;Jim Reeves: His Untold Story&quot;, this scenario is rebutted by eyewitnesses known to crash investigators, who saw the plane overhead immediately before the mishap and confirmed that Reeves was not upside down.

Reeves&#x27; friend, musician Marty Robbins, recalled hearing the wreck happen and alerting authorities to which direction he heard the impact. Jordan writes extensively about forensic evidence (including from the long-elusive tower tape and accident report), which suggests that instead of making a right turn to avoid the storm (as he had been advised by the approach controller to do), Reeves turned left in an attempt to follow Franklin Road to the airport. In so doing, he flew further into the rain. While preoccupied with trying to re-establish his ground references, Reeves let his airspeed get too low and stalled the aircraft. Relying on his instincts more than his training, evidence suggests he applied full power and pulled back on the yoke before leveling his wings—a fatal, but not uncommon, mistake that induced a stall/spin from which he was too low to recover. Jordan writes that according to the tower tape, Reeves ran into the heavy rain at 4:51 pm and crashed only a minute later.

When the wreckage was found some 42 hours later, the airplane&#x27;s engine and nose was discovered buried in the ground due to the impact of the crash. The crash site was in a wooded area north-northeast of Brentwood, roughly at the junction of Baxter Lane and Franklin Pike Circle, just east of Interstate 65, and southwest of Nashville International Airport where Reeves planned to land.

On the morning of August 2, 1964, after an intense search by several parties (which included several personal friends of Reeves, among them Ernest Tubb and Marty Robbins), the bodies of the singer and Dean Manuel were found in the wreckage of the aircraft, and at 1:00 pm local time, radio stations across the United States began to announce Reeves&#x27; death formally. Thousands of people traveled to pay their last respects at his funeral two days later. The coffin, draped in flowers from fans, was driven through the streets of Nashville and then to Reeves&#x27; final resting place near Carthage, Texas.

==Legacy==
 Reeves was elected posthumously to the Country Music Hall of Fame during 1967, which honored him by saying, &quot;The velvet style of &#x27;Gentleman Jim Reeves&#x27; was an international influence. His rich voice brought millions of new fans to country music from every corner of the world. Although the crash of his private airplane took his life, posterity will keep his name alive because they will remember him as one of the most important performers in Country music.&quot;

In 1998 Reeves was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in Carthage, Texas, where the Jim Reeves Memorial is located. The inscription on the memorial reads, &quot;If I, a lowly singer, dry one tear, or soothe one humble human heart in pain, then my homely verse to God is dear, and not one stanza has been sung in vain.&quot;

Each year, the Academy of Country Music awards the Jim Reeves International Award to an artist who has made an &quot;outstanding contributions to the acceptance of country music throughout the world.done the most to promote the genre worldwide&quot;.

===Posthumous releases===
Reeves&#x27; records continued to sell well, both earlier and new albums issued after his death. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;Reeves&#x27; career continued to thrive with hit records on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts throughout the next two decades&quot;. The last Reeves song on the chart was &quot;The Image Of Me&quot;, in 1984.

His widow, Mary, was instrumental in the ongoing success of the songs. She combined unreleased tracks with previous releases (placing updated instrumentals alongside Reeves&#x27; original vocals) to produce a regular series of &quot;new&quot; albums after her husband&#x27;s death. She also operated the Jim Reeves Museum in Nashville from the mid-1970s until 1996. On the 15th anniversary of Reeves death, Mary told a country music magazine interviewer, &quot;Jim Reeves my husband is gone; Jim Reeves the artist lives on.&quot;

During 1966, Reeves&#x27; record &quot;Distant Drums&quot; hit number one on the UK Singles Chart and remained there for five weeks. The song stayed in the UK chart for 25 weeks, and took number one on the US country music chart. Originally, &quot;Distant Drums&quot; had been recorded merely as a &quot;demo&quot; for its composer, Cindy Walker, believing it was for her personal use and had been deemed &quot;unsuitable&quot; for general release by Chet Atkins and RCA Victor. During 1966, however, RCA determined a market for the song existed because of the war in Vietnam. It was named Song of the Year in the UK during 1966 by the BBC, and Reeves became the first American artist to receive the accolade. That same year, singer Del Reeves (no relation) recorded an album paying tribute to him.

In 1980, Reeves was credited with two more top-10 posthumous duet hits, &quot;Have You Ever Been Lonely?&quot; and &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot;, which combined separate vocal tracks of both he and the late country star Patsy Cline, who had also passed away in an airplane crash mid-career. Although the two had never recorded together, producers Chet Atkins and Owen Bradley lifted their isolated vocal performances off original three-track stereo master session tapes, resynchronized them, and combined them with digitally re-recorded backing tracks. The duets first appeared on the &quot;Remembering Patsy Cline &amp; Jim Reeves&quot; LP.

Reeves&#x27; compilation albums containing well-known standards continue to sell well. &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot; scored number 21 in the UK album charts during July 2003, and &quot;Memories are Made of This&quot; reached number 35 during July 2004.

Since 2003, US-based VoiceMasters has issued more than 80 previously unreleased Reeves recordings, including new songs, as well as newly overdubbed material. Among them was &quot;I&#x27;m a Hit Again&quot;, the last song he recorded in his basement studio just a few days before his death. VoiceMasters overdubbed this track in the same studio in Reeves&#x27; former home (then owned by a Nashville record producer). The song was released in 2008 by H&amp;H Music (UK) and became number one in a survey of radio stations in the UK. Reeves&#x27; fans repeatedly urged RCA or Bear Family to re-release some of the songs overdubbed during the years after his death which have never appeared on CD.

A compilation CD, &quot;The Very Best of Jim Reeves&quot;, scored number eight on initial release in the UK Albums Chart during May 2009, to later score its maximum of number seven during late June, his first top-10 album in the UK since 1992. In 1994, the German Bear Family Records label released a 16-CD compilation titled &quot;Welcome to my World&quot;, including more than 75 unissued titles, and many demo recordings.

In 2014, a set of eight CDs was released by Intermusic S.A., titled &quot;The Great Jim Reeves&quot;, containing 170 tracks, remastered and remixed.

===Tributes===
Tributes to Reeves were composed in the British Isles after his death. The song &quot;A Tribute to Jim Reeves&quot; was written by Eddie Masterson, and recorded by Larry Cunningham and the Mighty Avons; during January 1965, it scored on the UK charts and top 10 in Ireland. It scored the UK charts on December 10, 1964, and was there for 11 weeks and sold 250,000 copies. The Dixielanders Show Band also recorded &quot;Tribute to Jim Reeves&quot; written by Steve Lynch and recorded during September 1964; it scored on the Northern Ireland charts during September 1964. The Masterson song was translated later into Dutch and recorded.

In the UK, &quot;We&#x27;ll Remember You&quot; was written by Geoff Goddard, but not released until 2008 on the &quot;Now &amp; Then: From Joe Meek to New Zealand&quot; double album by Houston Wells.

Jerry Jerry and the Sons of Rhythm Orchestra, a Canadian alternative rock band whose musical style blends elements of surf music, gospel music, rockabilly, garage, and punk, released the song entitled &quot;Jimmy Reeves&quot; on their 1992 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Mind If I Do&quot;

Reeves remains a popular artist in Ireland, and many Irish singers have recorded tribute albums. A play by author Dermot Devitt, &quot;Put Your Sweet Lips,&quot; was based on Reeves&#x27; appearance in Ireland at the Pavesi Ballroom in Donegal town on June 7, 1963, and reminiscences of people who attended.

Blind R&amp;B and blues music artist Robert Bradley (of the band Robert Bradley&#x27;s Blackwater Surprise) paid tribute to Reeves in the album description of his release, &quot;Out of the Wilderness&quot;. He said, &quot;This record brings me back to the time when I started out wanting to be a singer-songwriter, where the music did not need the New York Philharmonic to make it real...I wanted to do a record and just be Robert and sing straight like Jim Reeves on &#x27;Put Your Sweet Lips a Little Closer to the Phone&#x27;.&quot;

British comedian Vic Reeves adopted his stage name from Reeves and Vic Damone, two of his favorite singers.

In the United States, Del Reeves (no relation) recorded and released a 1966 album entitled &quot;Del Reeves Sings Jim Reeves&quot;.

Reeves&#x27; nephew, singer-songwriter John Rex Reeves (March 4, 1936 – November 15, 2022), appeared occasionally on RFD-TV&#x27;s &quot;Midwest Country,&quot; singing Reeves&#x27; songs, as well as other popular country songs. John Rex, a recording artist in his own right, had two songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart in 1981 (&quot;What Would You Do&quot; #93; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Reason&quot; #90). John Rex died after a long illness in Kingwood, Texas, at age 86.

In 2023, &quot;He&#x27;ll Have To Go&quot;, an independent short film named after Reeves&#x27; song of the same name was released and won the Finalist Award at the SWIFF International Film Festival for &quot;Best Short Film&quot;.

<doc id="406984" wikidata="Q530227" url="?curid=406984" title="Lisa Snowdon">
<text>Lisa Snowdon (born Lisa Snawdon; 23 January 1972) is an English television and radio presenter and fashion model. She was the host of the Living TV reality television show &quot;Britain&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; from 2006 until 2009. She also co-presented &quot;Capital Breakfast&quot; on Capital London from August 2008 until 18 December 2014.

==Early life==
Snowdon was born in Welwyn Garden City to insurance salesman Nigel and hairdresser Lydia Snawdon. She has two younger sisters.

She gained a scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, where her classmates included Naomi Campbell. She auditioned for the &quot;Minipops&quot;. After gaining too much additional height, and after her parents split up when she was 17, Snowdon stayed in London and worked briefly as a dance and yoga teacher.

==Modelling==
A fan of Christy Turlington from age 14, Snowdon never thought about becoming a model. Spotted by a Premier Model Management agent at age 19 while dancing at a rave at London&#x27;s MFI club, she was auditioned and signed up. She started working with renowned photographers and became one of Britain&#x27;s top fashion models.

Snowdon is best known for her beauty commercials and high-fashion cover and spread modelling, including cover shots for &quot;Later&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot;; she was also the face for Gucci.&quot;&quot; 

She later appeared in advertisements for Mercedes-Benz, Dove soap, and Kelloggs Special K, and was the face of campaigns for Neutrogena and After Eight mint straws, the &quot;Taxiwise&quot; safety campaign and numerous catalogues. Her modelling career led to appearances in &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;Loaded&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot;.

Snowdon returned to modelling when she became the face and model of Avon lingerie, and was one of the models for the Marks &amp; Spencer autumn 2010 campaign. From 2010–2014 she was the face of Belvita breakfast biscuits, appearing in adverts for the biscuits with fellow Capital FM DJ Johnny Vaughan. In 2015 she was appointed the lead-UK model for Triumph International.

==Television==
Snowdon&#x27;s first presenting role was in 2003 on BBC3&#x27;s Fightbox - a children&#x27;s show in which contestants created &#x27;avatars&#x27; to battle each other. Later she presented on MTV UK&#x27;s MTV Select. She took over the role from Lisa Butcher as the &quot;supermodel&quot; judge and host on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;. Snowdon left the show to concentrate on her radio show and was replaced by Elle Macpherson as of season six. In autumn 2007, she was announced as the new co-presenter of &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; with Sir David Frost on BBC One.

Snowdon had a starring role in Channel 4&#x27;s short film &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. She also had a cameo role in Channel 4 programme, &quot;Plus One&quot;.

In 2014, Snowdon co-hosted &quot;Weekend Kitchen with Waitrose&quot; with Steve Jones. The show aired on Saturday mornings on Channel 4.

In August 2016, Snowdon guest presented five episodes of &quot;Lorraine&quot;, standing in for Lorraine Kelly. In November 2016, Snowdon was confirmed as a contestant for the sixteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. She was voted off as the second celebrity to leave the jungle coming in second last place to her camp-mate Danny Baker.

In September 2022, Snowdon was crowned winner of the seventeenth series of &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot;.

===&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;===
Snowdon took part in the sixth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing,&quot; and was partnered with Brendan Cole. They made the final and finished in 3rd place.

==Radio==
At the end of August 2008, it was announced that Snowdon was to be the permanent replacement for Denise van Outen on Capital London as co-host with Jonny Vaughan. In January 2010, the pair signed a two-year deal to continue presenting the show. On 1 December 2011 it was confirmed she would remain at Capital. 

Snowdon was given the nickname &#x27;Eggy&#x27; on the show by colleague Dave Berry after her penchant for boiled eggs and the smell they gave off in the studio. On 13 November 2015, she announced that she would be leaving Capital Breakfast at the end of 2015.

==Charitable activities==
In 2005, Snowdon became an ambassador for the Breast Cancer Care charity.

In 2008, Snowdon participated in a celebrity edition of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; as part of the BBC&#x27;s biennial Sport Relief event. In 2010, she became an Ambassador of Capital FM&#x27;s Help a Capital Child charity.

In November 2010, after turning on the Bond Street Christmas Lights, Snowdon was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with viral meningitis. As a result, she began raising money and acting as an ambassador for the Meningitis Trust.

==Personal life==
Snowdon dated Dave Loeffler from US band E.Y.C. for three years. She was also in a five-year on/off relationship with actor George Clooney from 2000 until 2005. Their relationship was well reported in the tabloids on both sides of the Atlantic. After 14 months of dating, Snowdon revealed in 2017 her engagement to her boyfriend George Smart.

Snowdon lives in Epping Forest, and has a flat in Camden, north London, which she uses during the week.

<doc id="406992" wikidata="Q3044407" url="?curid=406992" title="Demographics of Quebec">
<text>The demographics of Quebec constitutes a complex and sensitive issue, especially as it relates to the national question. Quebec is the only one of Canada&#x27;s provinces to feature a Francophone (French-speaking) majority, and where anglophones (English-speakers) constitute an officially recognized minority group. According to the 2011 census, French is spoken by more than 85.5% of the population while this number rises to 88% for children under 15 years old. According to the 2011 census, 95% of Quebec&#x27;s people are able to conduct a conversation in French, with less than 5% of the population not able to speak French.

In 2024, Statistics Canada had estimated the province&#x27;s population to be 9,100,249. In the 2021 census, Quebec&#x27;s population was determined to be 8,501,833 living in 3,749,035 of its 4,050,164 total dwellings, a 4.1% change from its 2011 population of 8,164,361. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. Quebec accounts for a little under 23% of the Canadian population. Quebec&#x27;s demographic weight in Canada has been gradually decreasing since 1971 when it was 28% of the population. In 2023, Quebec&#x27;s three most populated regions are Montreal (2,109,525), Montérégie (1,492,662) and Capitale-Nationale (793,001). Quebec&#x27;s three least populated regions are Nord-du-Québec (46,650), Côte-Nord (89,914) and Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine (92,059).

Quebec is home to &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most valuable founder populations&quot;. Founder populations are very valuable to medical genetic research as they are pockets of low genetic variability which provide a useful research context for discovering gene-disease linkages. The Quebec founder population arose through the influx of people into Quebec from France in the 17th century to mid-18th century; a high proportion of the settlers either returned to France or died. Of the approximately 33,500 colonists who arrived to Canada, fewer than 10,000 remained. There were approximately 8,500 colonists who settled from France and had at least one child in the colony. About seven million Canadians (along with several million French Americans in the United States) are descendants of these original 8,500 colonists.

==Vital statistics==

While Quebec&#x27;s fertility rate is higher than the Canadian average, it has been sharply decreasing in the past 15 years. At 1.38 children per woman in 2008, it is above the Canada-wide rate of 1.26, and is just above the historic low of 1.36 in 1987. This contrasts with its fertility rates before 1960, which were among the highest of any industrialized society. For example, between 1951 and 1961, the population grew nearly 30% with only small net migration (large number of international migrants had settled in Quebec in the preceding period but large numbers of Quebec residents had emigrated to other provinces as well as New England), a natural growth rate matched today only by some African countries.

Although Quebec is home to only 22.0% of the population of Canada, the number of international adoptions in Quebec is the highest of all provinces of Canada. In 2001, 42% of international adoptions in Canada were carried out in Quebec.

Population growth rate: 2.5% (2023)

Birth rate: 8.8‰ (2023)

Synthetic fertility index: 1.38 (2023)

Death rate: 7.0‰ (2023)

Permanent immigration rate: 6.0‰ (2003)

Infant mortality rate: 0.46% (2023)

Life expectancy: In 2002, life expectancy was 80.7 years for males and 84.1 years for females.

Urbanisation: In 2001, 80.4% of Quebecers lived in urban areas.

Marriages: In 2019, 22,250 marriages were celebrated, about 600 less than in 2017 and 2018. These numbers illustrate a continuing trend where marriages are becoming less numerous; in 1970, the number of marriages hit a peak with more than 50,000 celebrations and the number has been slowly decreasing ever since. The average age for marriage is now 33.5 for men and 32.1 for women, an increase of 8.0 and 8.5 years respectively since 1970. 72% of marriages occur on a Saturday. Half of all marriages unite a man and woman with an age gap of 3 years or less. Though they are still uncommon, civil unions are becoming more and more popular.

Demographic growth: In 2019, Quebec registered the highest rate of population growth since 1972 (when quality data began to be recorded), with an increase of 110,000 people, mostly because of the arrival of a high number of non-permanent residents. The number of non-permanent residents has recently sky-rocketed from a little over 100,000 in 2014 to 260,000 in 2019. Quebec&#x27;s population growth is usually middle-of-the-pack compared to other provinces and very high compared to other developed countries (ex. United States, France, Germany, etc.) because of the federal government of Canada&#x27;s aggressive immigration policies. Since the 1970s, Quebec has always had more immigrants than emigrants. This can be attributed to international immigration as the number of people moving to Quebec from another province is always lower than the other way around. As of 2019, most international immigrants come from China, India or France.

Education and work: In 2016, 3 out of 10 people in Quebec possessed a postsecondary degree or diploma. While women were more likely to have a university degree (33% vs 26%) or college degree (21% vs 11%), men were more numerous in having received vocational training. In Quebec, couples where both parents work are far more likely to have children than couples where only one parent works or none of them do.

Households: In Quebec, most people are owners of the property that they live in. The vast majority of couples with or without children are property owners. Most one-person households, however, are renters. Single-parent homes are equally divided between being property owners or renters. From 1996 to 2016, the number of people per household has decreased from an average of 2.5 to 2.25. In 2016, the vast majority of low income households were one-person households. In 2016, 80% of both property owners and renters considered their housing to be &quot;unaffordable&quot;.

==Population centres==

==Age structure==

Age structure: &quot;(2016 census)&quot;
In 2016, Quebec&#x27;s median age was 41.2 years old. According to Quebec&#x27;s age pyramid, the most numerous generation is the baby-boomers that are between 54 and 74 years of age. There are a few other less pronounced peaks, namely in the 1980s, and the one around 2010. A noticeable crater can be observed around the year 2000 because of a record-low amount of births. In 2020, 20.8% of the population is less than 20 years old, 59.5% are aged between 20 and 64 years old, and 19.7% are 65 years old or older. In 2019, Quebec witnessed an increase in the number of births compared to the year before (84,200 vs 83,840) and had a replacement rate of about 1.6 per woman. Replacement rates being below 2.1 something that is the norm in industrialised regions like Quebec. Quebec has a higher replacement rate than the Canadian average (1,47). Quebec&#x27;s rate can also be both higher (ex. Switzerland (1.48), Portugal (1.42), Japan (1.36), Italy (1.29), etc.) or lower (ex. United States (1.73), New Zealand (1.75), Sweden (1.70), England (1.65), etc.) than other industrialised regions&#x27;. In Quebec, a lowered rate of giving birth has been mostly observed in people in their 20s. From 30 years of age and onwards, the rate is either increasing or stable. This demonstrates a trend towards wanting to form a family later in life. As of 2020, the average lifespan is 82.3 years. Between 2010 and 2019, there were between 1000 and 1600 deaths every week, with deaths being at their highest levels in January and their lowest levels in July. In 2021, the region&#x27;s life expectancy increased after a decline amid the pandemic, reaching 83 years.

Ethnicity according to the older more general system of classification is shown below:

=== Future projections ===
==Visible minorities and Indigenous peoples==
The 2021 census counted a total Indigenous population of 205,010 (2.5%) including 116,550 First Nations (1.4%), 61,010 Métis (0.7%), and 15,800 Inuit (0.2%). The Indigenous population tends to be undercounted, as some Indian bands regularly refuse to participate in Canadian censuses for political reasons regarding the question of Indigenous sovereignty. In 2016, the Mohawk reserves of Kahnawake and Doncaster 17 along with the Indian settlement of Kanesatake and Lac-Rapide, a reserve of the Algonquins of Barriere Lake, were not counted.

Approximately 16% of the population of Quebec belongs to a visible minority group, as of the 2021 Canadian census. This is a lower percentage than that of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, and Manitoba but higher than that of the remaining five provinces. Most visible minorities in Quebec live in or near Montreal.

The indigenous peoples of Quebec have inhabited the region for several millennia. Each community possesses its own social structure, culture and territorial entity. In 2016, the indigenous population of Quebec numbered 182,885 people. However, because federal law only recognized children of indigenous fathers until the 1980s, the actual number may be higher.

All the ethnicities living primarily south of the 55th parallel are collectively referred to in Quebec as &quot;Amerindians&quot;, &quot;Indians&quot;, &quot;First Nations&quot; or, obsolete, &quot;Redskins&quot;. The ten First Nations ethnic groups in Quebec are linked to two linguistic groups. The Algonquian family is made up of eight ethnic groups: the Abenaki, the Algonquin, the Attikamek, the Cree, the Wolastoqiyik, the Mi&#x27;kmaq, the Innu and the Naskapis. These last two formed, until 1978, a single ethnic group: the Innu. The Iroquoian family is made up of the Huron-Wendat and the Mohawks. Only the Mohawks were part of the Iroquois Confederacy (&quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;), along with five other Indigenous groups from New York State and Ontario. The eleventh indigenous ethnic group in Quebec, the Inuit (or, obsolete, the Eskimos), belong to the Inuit–Aleut family. The Inuit live mainly in Nunavik, Nord-du-Québec (Nouveau Quebec) and make up the majority of the population living north of the 55th parallel.

Of these indigenous peoples, so-called &quot;nomadic&quot; tribes exist, specifically the tribes of Algonquian cultures (eg: the Algonquins, the Cree and the Innu), as well as more &quot;sedentary&quot; ones, specifically the tribes of Iroquoian traditions (eg: the Iroquois and the Hurons-Wendat). The more sedentary groups are the ones who developed more complex forms of social organization. Traditionally, nomadic tribes follow the migration of herds of animals that serve as prey, such as bison, moose or seals. The way of life of the Algonquian and Inuit tribes is dictated by the obligations of hunting and fishing. The traditions of the Iroquoian tribes, producers of the Three Sisters (corn, beans and squash), are instead developed around a matriarchal structure derived from the &quot;long cabin&quot; called a longhouse which houses within it several families under the authority of one dean.

===Relations with Québécois===

Although they represent today approximately 3% of the Quebec population, the indigenous peoples of Quebec have contributed a lot to Quebec society thanks to their ideals of respect for flora, fauna, nature and the environment as well as thanks to their values of hospitality, generosity and sharing. Economically, through the fur trade and the development of relationships with settlers, including coureurs des bois, merchants, cartographers and Jesuit fathers. In addition to contributing to , indigenous peoples also contributed through their more advanced knowledge than settlers in the following areas: holistic medicine, the functioning of human biology, remedies for several diseases, curing scurvy at settlers&#x27; arrival (its thought this was done with a cure made from fir, white cedar or &quot;anneda&quot;), winter clothing (tanning), architecture that insulates against the cold, means of faster transport on snow (snowshoes and dogsled) and on water (canoes, kayaks and rabaskas), &quot;l&#x27;acériculture&quot; (the process of making maple syrup), sports (lacrosse and ice fishing), moose and caribou hunting, trapping, the territory and its components, watersheds and their watercourses and natural resources.

When Europeans arrived in America in the 16th century, the Algonquian-speaking peoples and the St. Lawrence Iroquoians made allies with the French colonists for the purpose of trade. The first connection was made with the arrival of Jacques Cartier when he set foot in Gaspé and met Donnacona, chief of the village of Stadacona (Stadaconé, today, the city of Quebec), in 1534. Moreover, the legend of the Kingdom of Saguenay prompted King Francis I to finance new trips to the New World.
===Rights of indigenous people===

In the Royal Proclamation of 1763, issued by King George III, the indigenous peoples were stated to have an indisputable right to their lands. However, quickly following the proclamation and after the peace treaties with New France and France concluded, the British Crown decided to institute territorial treaties which allowed British authorities to proceed with the total extinction of the land titles of the Indigenous groups.

Entirely under federal tutelage and direction, indigenous rights were enunciated in the Indian Act and adopted at the end of the 19th century. This act confines First Nations within the Indian reserves created for them. The Indian Act is still in effect today.

In 1975, the Cree, Inuit and the Quebec government agreed to an agreement called the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement that would extended Indigenous rights beyond Indian reserves, and to over two-thirds of Quebec&#x27;s territory. Because this extension was enacted without the participation of the federal government, the extended Indigenous rights only exist in Quebec. In 1978, the Naskapis joined the agreement when the Northeastern Quebec Agreement was signed. As a result, these three ethnic groups were able to break away from their subjugation to the Indian Act.

In recent times, discussions have been underway for several years with the Montagnais of the Côte-Nord and Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean for the potential creation of a similar autonomy in two new distinct territories that would be called &quot;Innu Assi&quot; and &quot;Nitassinan&quot;. Moreover, in January 2010, an agreement between Quebec City and Montagnais granted the Mashteuiatsh Band Council the ability to plan out development in the entire Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve, which is located on the &quot;Nitassinan&quot; of the community of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh.

A few political institutions have also been created over time:
* The Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador
* The Grand Council of the Crees
* The Makivik Corporation

===Indigenous lands===
The following table shows the traditional territories of the First Nations and Inuit peoples who live in Quebec, including the basins of the St. Lawrence Valley and James Bay, as well as on the Labrador peninsula.


==Acadians==

The subject of Acadians in Quebec is an important one as more than a million people in Quebec are of Acadian ascent, with roughly 4.8 million possessing one or multiple Acadian ancestors in their genealogy tree. Furthermore, more than a million people wear a patronym of Acadian origin. All of this is because a large number of Acadians had fled Acadia to take refuge in Quebec during the Great Upheaval.

Quebec houses an Acadian community spread out across several regions. Nowadays, Acadians mainly live on the Magdalen Islands and in Gaspesia, but about thirty other communities are present elsewhere in Quebec, mostly in the Côte-Nord and Centre-du-Québec regions. An Acadian community in Quebec can be called a &quot;Cadie&quot; or &quot;Petite Cadie&quot;, and some cities and villages use the demonym &quot;Cadien&quot;.

The &quot;Festival Acadien des Îles-de-la-Madeleine&quot; is a festival which occurs every year in memory of the founders of the first villages on the Magdalen Islands. The festival is held in Havre Aubert for about two weeks. There, Québécois and Acadians from all corners of Quebec and other neighbouring lands mingle to celebrate Acadian culture. The town of Bonaventure, in Gaspesia, also houses the &quot;Musé Acadien du Québec&quot; which features permanent exhibitions on Acadians in Quebec, like &quot;Une Acadie québécoise&quot; and &quot;Secrets d&#x27;Acadiens, les coulisses de la rue Grand-Pré&quot;. In 2002, on National Acadian Day, the &quot;Commission de la capitale nationale du Québec&quot; unveiled a monument to Acadians entitled &quot;Towards the Light&quot;. The monument symbolizes and explains the predominant role that the Acadians and their descendants played in the history of Quebec. The Premier of Quebec, Bernard Landry, declared at this unveiling that: 

==Languages==
Quebec differs from other Canadian provinces in that French is the only official and preponderant language, while English predominates in the rest of Canada. French is the common language, understood and spoken by 94.46% of the population. Quebec is the only Canadian province whose population is mainly Francophone; 6,102,210 people (78.1% of the population) recorded it as their sole native language in the 2011 Census, and 6,249,085 (80.0%) recorded that they spoke it most often at home. Knowledge of French is widespread even among those who do not speak it natively; in 2011, about 94.4% of the total population reported being able to speak French, alone or in combination with other languages.

A considerable number of Quebec residents consider themselves to be bilingual in French and English. In Quebec, about 42.6% of the population (3,328,725 people) report knowing both languages; this is the highest proportion of bilinguals in any Canadian province. The federal electoral district of Lac-Saint-Louis, located in the Bilingual Belt, is the most bilingual area in the province with 72.8% of its residents claiming to know English and French, according to the 2011 census. In contrast, in the rest of Canada, in 2006, only about 10.2 percent (2,430,990) of the population had a knowledge of both of the country&#x27;s official languages.

The Quebec government defends the French language and the Francophonie in the face of the mostly English-dominated rest of North America. The Gendron Commission report of 1968 established the foundations for the white book of the government of Quebec&#x27; linguistic policy. Dependent on commissions of inquiry, this policy statement is also accompanied the Charter of the French language -or &quot;Bill 101&quot;- since 1977. 

===French===

French is the official language of Quebec. Québécois French is the most widely used variant. The oversees the application of the linguistic policy on the territory jointly with the Superior Council of the French Language and the Commission de toponymie du Québec. Their recommendations then become part of the debate on the standard for Quebec French and are represented in Le Grand Dictionnaire terminologique (GDT), the (BDL) and various other works. Through its linguistic recommendations, the GDT fights against the invasion of Frenglish into the French language. Since the 1970s, scientific research on the matter has been carried out by university organizations, including the Trésor de la langue française au Québec (TLFQ) and the .

The French settlers who settled in New France came largely from the western and northern provinces of France. They generally spoke a variety of regional languages of the Oïl language family. Thus, creating the need for the colonists to &quot;unify their &quot;patois&quot;&quot; (&quot;unite their dialects&quot;) and creating Quebec French. Québécois French became the vernacular language of New France, and it remained as such until the British&#x27;s conquest of New France.

Early on, colonists borrowed words from Algonquin, a language they frequently interacted with, often to name and describe new aspects of geography, temperature, fauna or flora not present in the Old World. Then, Quebec French&#x27;s evolution was affected by the French court due to the arrival of the King&#x27;s daughters. These 800 women were mostly orphaned girls that had been adopted by the state as part of a program sponsored by King Louis XIV, and been educated in convents to become exemplary settlers and wives. Once their training was complete, between 1663 and 1673, they were sent to New France and married among the colonists, instilling the &quot;King&#x27;s French&quot; into the population in the process.

In his 1757 &quot;Memoir on the State of New France&quot;, Bougainville writes: 

The British conquest of 1759 turned the evolution of French in Quebec and North America upside down. By having ties severed with France, the French spoken in Quebec definitively separated from the French spoken in metropolitan France. Quebec French was then truly born, retaining the peculiarities of the old languages of Oïl (which were almost extinct in France at that point) and the &quot;King&#x27;s French&quot;, and being both influenced and threatened by the language of the new English conquerors. Quebec&#x27;s French continued to evolve in its own direction, retaining some aspects the non-isolated rest of the French-speaking world lost, and, over time, new influences and remoteness formed the regional accents and different dialects of Quebec French.

Canada is estimated to be home to between 32 and 36 regional French accents, 17 of which can be found in Quebec. There are 11 accents exclusive to mainland Quebec; they are the regional accents of Gaspé (Gaspésien), Bas-Saint-Laurent, Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean (Saguenéen), Quebec-Charlevoix, Beauce (Beauceron), the Eastern Townships, Mauricie-Haute-Mauricie (Magoua), Greater Montreal, Eastern Montreal-Laval, Rouyn-Noranda and Côte-Nord. There are 4 accents off the mainland, 1 on the Isle-aux-Coudres, and 3 on the Îles-de-la-Madeleine: the accents of &quot;Villages Medelinots&quot;, &quot;Havre-aux-Maisons&quot;, and &quot;Havre-Aubert&quot;. Finally, there are 2 accents that cross provincial borders: the accents of Outaouais-Eastern Ontario (Outaouais) and Témiscouata-Madawaska (Brayon). There are also people in Quebec who will naturally speak using &quot;Standard Québécois&quot; or Joual, both of which are considered sociolects rather than regional accents.

====Fragility and protection of French====

During the days of New France, there began to be an extremely pronounced demographic increase of anglophones versus francophones in North America, a trend which continues to this day. In 1700, for every 250,000 English-speakers, there was 16,500 French-speakers.

After the conquest of 1759, this reality became more brutal for Quebec, which now had to avoid assimilation by the British Empire&#x27;s regime and survive culturally as well as linguistically.

Still today, as French&#x27;s demographic weight on the continent and in Canada continues to decline, Quebec faces the threat of assimilation. Since 2011, the population with French as their mother tongue on the Island of Montreal, Quebec&#x27;s metropolis, has fallen below 50%, with only 49% of the population being francophone due to a sharp increase in the immigrant allophone population (whose mother tongue is neither French nor English).

Efforts have been made to preserve the primacy of the French language in Quebec. Such efforts include: instating the Charter of the French language, Quebec&#x27;s participation in the Francophonie since 1971, French immigration to Quebec, etc. Several institutions seek to protect and promote French such as the , the Superior Council of the French Language, the Commission de toponymie du Québec, etc.

===English===
As of 2011, English is the mother tongue of nearly 650,000 Quebecers (8% of the population). Anglo-Quebecers constitute the second largest linguistic group in Quebec. In addition, in 2001, roughly 50,000 people (0.7% of the population) considered their mother tongue to be both French and English. According to the latest censuses of 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016, the percentage of anglophones in the population has more or less stabilized, but in absolute numbers, they are constantly increasing. Allophones, on the other hand, are increasing sharply in absolute numbers as well as in percentage. According to the 2016 census, 49.1% of people living in Quebec say they can conduct a conversation in English (English as mother tongue or as a second language). As for French-English bilingualism, 44.5% of people in Quebec state that they are bilingual, that is to say, able to conduct a conversation in both French and English.

English made its first appearance in Quebec in 1760, when the British invaded and conquered &quot;Canada&quot; (New France). Shortly afterwards, the first English and Scottish merchants came to settle in the cities of Québec City and Montreal. In 1784, United Empire Loyalists flooded Quebec following their expulsion from the Thirteen Colonies during the United States&#x27; War of Independence. This dramatically increased the number of English speakers in Quebec. These Loyalists, avoiding the French-speaking and Catholic countryside, settled mainly in then underdeveloped regions, such as the Eastern Townships and the Outaouais. The proclamation of the Act of Union of 1840 caused massive immigration from the British Isles to Quebec, which introduced Celtic languages for the first time, and was aimed at the linguistic assimilation of the French-speaking population, which had a considerable impact on French-language culture in Quebec. Today, Anglo-Quebecers reside mainly in Montreal and the Pontiac region.

Anglophones in Quebec have several institutions and infrastructural systems. At the school level, anglophones in Quebec have several school boards grouped together into the &quot;Association des commissions scolaire anglophones du Québec&quot;. In terms of media, anglophones own, among others, the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; in Montreal, and the &quot;Chronicle-Telegraph&quot; in Quebec City. Other organisations include the Quebec Writers&#x27; Federation, which is a group of English-speaking Quebec authors, and the Voice of English-speaking Quebec, which represents the interests of the English-speaking community in the Québec region.

===Other languages===
The term &quot;allophone&quot; is used to refer to people whose mother tongue is neither French nor English. We can distinguish two groups of allophones: people who speak indigenous languages, and those who speak so-called immigrant languages.

In the 2016 census, where one could note more than one language as their mother tongue, Quebec had 1,171,045 people (14.5% of the population) who reported a mother tongue that was neither French nor English, and 1,060,830 people (13.2% of the population) who did not declare French or English as a mother tongue at all. In this census, 47,025 (0.6% of the population) reported an aboriginal language as a mother tongue, while 1,124,020 (13.9% of the population) reported an immigrant language as a mother tongue.

===Indigenous languages===

Three families of aboriginal languages exist in Quebec, which encompass eleven languages. Each of these languages belong to and are spoken by members of a specific ethnic group. Sometimes, the language in question is spoken natively by all members of the group, sometimes they are spoken only by a few individuals. These languages are also sometimes sub-divided into different dialects in the indigenous communities.
* Algonquian language family
** Abenaki (spoken by the Abenakis of Centre-du-Québec)
** Algonquin (spoken by the Algonquins of the Outaouais)
** Maliseet-passamaquoddy (spoken by the Maliseet of Bas-Saint-Laurent)
** Mi&#x27;kmaq (spoken by the Micmacs of Gaspésie and the Magdalen Islands)
** the linguistic continuum of:
*** Atikamekw (spoken by the Attikameks of Lanaudière and Mauricie)
*** Cree (spoken by the Crees of Nord-du-Québec)
*** Innu-aimun (spoken by the Innu-Montagnais of the Côte-Nord and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean)
*** Naskapi (spoken by the Innu-Naskapi of the Côte-Nord)
* Inuit-Aleut language family
** Nunavimmiutitut (Inuktitut dialect spoken by the Inuit of Nord-du-Québec)
* Iroquoian language family
** Mohawk, also known as &quot;agnier&quot; (spoken by the Iroquois-Mohawks of Montérégie and the Laurentides)
** Wendat (spoken by the Huron-Wendat of the Capitale-Nationale)

In the 2016 census, 50,895 people in Quebec said they knew at least one indigenous language. Furthermore, 45,570 people declared having an aboriginal language as their mother tongue. For 38,995 of them, it was the language most frequently spoken at home. Additionally, 1,195 people who did not have an aboriginal language as their mother tongue reported using an aboriginal language most often at home.

In Quebec, most indigenous languages are currently transmitted quite well from one generation to the next with a mother tongue retention rate of 92%.

===Immigrant languages===

In the 2016 census, 1,124,020 people declared having an immigrant language as their mother tongue in Quebec. The most cited languages are Arabic (2.5% of the total population), Spanish (1.9%), Italian (1.4%), Creole languages (mainly Haitian Creole) (0.8%) and Mandarin (0.6%).

Both the number and proportion of allophones have been increasing in Quebec since the 1951 census.

In 2015, the vast majority (89%) of young allophone students in Quebec attended French-language schools.

==Religion==

Religion, more precisely the Roman Catholic Church, has long occupied a central and integral place in Quebec society since the arrival of the first French settlers in New France. However, since the Quiet Revolution and the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, there has been a real separation between state and religion, and society in general sees religion as a private matter. 

From the beginning of &quot;Canada&quot;, and throughout French-Canadian history, catholicism and the Catholic Church have played a preponderant role in the social and political development of Quebec.

The first mass in what would become Quebec was celebrated in 1535, by the priest accompanying Jacques Cartier on his voyage to the New World. Amerindians were evangelized by Catholic missionaries before the founding of parishes. In 1627, Cardinal Richelieu recited a royal proclamation by Louis XIII which banished all non-Catholics, including Huguenots, from New France. In 1658, the apostolic vicariate of Quebec was founded, followed by the Archdiocese of Quebec in 1674. The archbishop of Quebec, who today is the primate of the Catholic Church of Canada, was once part of the Sovereign Council of New France.

The extraordinary power that the Catholic Church once had in Quebec is reflected in all areas of culture, from language to the fine arts, theater, literature and film. The golden age for ecclesiastics would come in the mid-nineteenth century (around 1840) as this was a period during which the Church, influenced by ultramontanism, concretized its influence (see Clericalism in Quebec). The influence of the Church began to wane a hundred years later, when, after the Grande Noirceur, Quebec society was profoundly transformed by the Quiet Revolution. Created in 1966, the deals with current issues concerning ethical and moral values (ex. gay marriage, euthanasia and abortion).

Several holy men and women from Quebec have been recognized for their venerable actions and canonized as saints:
* Saint Brother André Bessette canonized in 2010 by Pope Benedict XVI.
* Saint Kateri Tekakwitha canonized on October 21, 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI.
* Saint Mary of the Incarnation canonized in 2014 by Pope François.
* Saint François de Laval canonized in 2014 by Pope François.
Protestantism, a practice consisting of reformed catholicism, has been present in Quebec for a long time. From the very beginning of &quot;Canada&quot;, several Huguenots of the calvinist religion were present in Quebec. Huguenots have been identified in almost all classes of society: settlers, fishermen, daughters of the king, etc. During the early French Regime, the number of protestant immigrants was estimated to be 1,450 people. In 1627, protestantism became no longer tolerated in New France. After Quebec was conquered by the British, the Protestant religion, more particularly of the Anglican faith, became tolerated again. This was because British immigrants who came to certain regions of Quebec followed this religion.

The preceded Catholicism in Quebec.

While the first synagogue was established in Montreal in 1777, Jews remained a negligible religious group in Quebec until the early 20th century when a wave of Jewish immigrants settled in Montreal. The Jewish community of today, established mainly on the island of Montreal, now numbers about 120,000 people. In 2010, this community was made up of 26.1% traditionalist Jews, 24.3% orthodox, 15.2% conservative, 9% reconstructionist and reformist, and 25.4% of Montreal Jews say they have no religious affiliation. In the 20th century, successive waves of immigrants from Africa, Asia, Greece, Ireland and Italy settled in Montreal, bringing their cultural and religious customs. Some religious communities, such as Eastern Christians, then established places of worship.
=== Religion and politics ===

Many aspects of life for French-speaking Quebeckers remained dominated by the Catholic Church in the decades following 1867. The Church operated many of the institutions of the province, including most French-language schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations. The leader of the Catholic Church in Quebec was the Bishop of Montreal, and from 1840 to 1876 this was Ignace Bourget, an opponent of liberalism. Bourget eventually succeeded in gaining more influence than the liberal, reformist Institut Canadien. At his most extreme, Bourget went so far as to deny a Church burial to Joseph Guibord, a member of the Institut, in 1874. A court decision forced Bourget to allow Guibord to be buried in a Catholic cemetery, but Bourget deconsecrated the burial plot of ground, and Guibord was buried under army protection. The conservative approach of the Catholic Church was the major force in Quebec society until the reforms of the Quiet Revolution during the 1960s. In 1876, Pierre-Alexis Tremblay was defeated in a federal by-election because of pressure from the Church on voters, but succeeded in getting his loss annulled with the help of a new federal law. He quickly lost the subsequent election. In 1877, the Pope sent representatives to force the Quebec Churchto minimize its interventions in the electoral process.

Lionel Groulx wanted to build a nationalistic French-Canadian identity, in purpose to protect the power of the Church and dissuade the public from popular-rule and secularist views. Groulx propagated French-Canadian nationalism and argued that maintaining a Roman Catholic Quebec was the only means to &#x27;emancipate the nation against English power.&#x27; He believed the powers of the provincial government of Quebec could and should be used within Confederation, to bolster provincial autonomy (and thus Church power), and advocated it would benefit the French-Canadian nation economically, socially, culturally and linguistically. Groulx successfully promoted Québécois nationalism and the ultra-conservative Catholic social doctrine, to which the Church would maintain dominance in political and social life in Quebec. In the 1920s–1950s, this form of traditionalist Catholic nationalism became known as clerico-nationalism.

In 1936, Maurice Duplessis hung a crucifix in the National Assembly of Quebec. It hung there for 83 years, until it was removed on 10 July 2019.

During the 1940s and 1950s Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis party, the Union Nationale, often had the active support of the Roman Catholic Church during political campaigns, using the slogan &quot;Le ciel est bleu; l&#x27;enfer est rouge&quot; (&quot;Heaven is blue; hell is red&quot;; red is the colour of the Liberal party, and blue was the colour of the Union Nationale).

Sharia law is explicitly banned in Quebec, upheld by a unanimous vote against it in 2005 by the National Assembly.

=== Churches ===

The oldest parish church in North America is the Cathedral-Basilica of Notre-Dame de Québec. Its construction began in 1647, when it was then known under the name &quot;Notre-Dame-de-la-Paix&quot;, and it was finished in 1664. Its first mass was celebrated by Father Vimont on December 24, 1650. This church obtained the status of cathedral in 1674, when François de Laval became archbishop of Quebec, and then the status of minor basilica in 1874. It was also rebuilt twice after the siege of Quebec in 1759 and the fire of 1922.

The most frequented place of worship in Quebec is the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré. This basilica welcomes millions of visitors each year, especially during the novena of Saint Anne, on July 26. The Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré basilica is recognized for its numerous miracles, which is why thousands of crutches can be found at its entrance.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory is the largest place of worship in the world dedicated to Saint Joseph. Located beside Mount Royal, it is known for its 283 steps, which pilgrims come to climb on their knees every year, reciting a prayer on each of the steps.

Many pilgrimages include places such as Saint Benedict Abbey, , Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica, Marie-Reine-du-Monde de Montréal Basilica-Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica-Cathedral, Saint-Patrick&#x27;s Basilica, etc.

Another important place of worship in Quebec is the anglican Holy Trinity Cathedral, which was erected between 1800 and 1804. It was the first anglican cathedral built outside the British Isles.

In August 2019, the Minister of Culture, Nathalie Roy, announced the allocation of $15 million to preserve the cultural heritage that the churches of Quebec embody, and $5 million for the requalification of places of worship.

== Migration ==
=== Immigration ===
The 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 1,210,595 persons or 14.6 percent of the total population of Quebec.
=== Recent immigration ===
The 2021 Canadian census counted a total of 202,740 people who immigrated to Quebec between 2016 and 2021.
=== Interprovincial migration ===
Since it began being recorded in 1971 until 2018, each year Quebec has had negative interprovincial migration, and among the provinces it has experienced the largest net loss of people due to the effect. Between 1981 and 2017, Quebec lost 229,700 people below the age of 45 to interprovincial migration. Per capita, Quebec has lost significantly fewer people than other provinces. This is due to the large population of the province and the very low migration rate of francophone Quebeckers. However, Quebec receives much fewer than average in-migrants from other provinces.

In Quebec, allophones are more likely to migrate out of the province than average: between 1996 and 2001, over 19,170 migrated to other provinces; 18,810 of whom migrated to Ontario.

<doc id="406993" wikidata="Q738652" url="?curid=406993" title="Trobriand Islands">
<text>The Trobriand Islands are a archipelago of coral atolls off the east coast of New Guinea. They are part of the nation of Papua New Guinea and are in Milne Bay Province. Most of the population of 60,000 (2016) indigenous inhabitants live on the main island of Kiriwina, which is also the location of the government station, Losuia.

Other major islands in the group are Kaileuna, Vakuta, and Kitava. The group is considered to be an important tropical rainforest ecoregion in need of conservation.

==Geography==
The Trobriands consist of four main islands: Kiriwina—the largest—and Kaileuna, Vakuta, and Kitava. Kiriwina is long, and varies in width from . In the 1980s, there were around 60 villages on the island, containing around 12,000 people, while the other islands were restricted to a population of hundreds. Other than some elevation on Kiriwina, the islands are flat coral atolls and &quot;remain hot and humid throughout the year, with frequent rainfall.&quot;

==People==
==History==

The first European visitor to the islands was the French ship &quot;Espérance&quot; in 1793. The ship&#x27;s navigator, Antoine Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux, named them after his first lieutenant, Denis de Trobriand. 

Whaling ships called at the islands for food, water, and wood in the 1850s and 1860s.

The first Europeans to settle in the Trobriand islands were a Methodist minister, Samuel Benjamin Fellows, and his wife Sarah Margaret Fellows, who moved to Kiriwina in 1894. They were followed a decade later by colonial officers from Australia who set up a governmental station nearby, and soon foreign traders began to set up a small colony on the island. In the 1930s, the Sacred Heart Catholic Mission set up a settlement containing a primary school nearby. It was following this European colonisation that the name &quot;Trobriand&quot; was legally adopted for this group of islands.

The first anthropologist to study the Trobrianders was C. G. Seligman, who focused on the Massim people of mainland New Guinea. Seligman was followed a number of years later by his student, Bronisław Malinowski, who visited the islands during the First World War. Despite being a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian empire, which was at war with Australia, which then controlled the Trobriand Islands, he was allowed to stay (provided he checked in with authorities every now and then). His descriptions of the &quot;kula&quot; exchange system, gardening, magic, and sexual practices—all classics of modern anthropological writing—prompted many foreign researchers to visit the societies of the island group and study other aspects of their cultures. The psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich drew on Malinowski&#x27;s studies of the islands in writing &quot;The Invasion of Compulsory Sex Morality&quot; and in developing his theory of sex economy in his 1936 work .

In 1943, Allied troops landed on the islands as a part of Operation Cartwheel, the Allied advance to Rabaul. 

In the 1970s, some indigenous peoples formed anti-colonial associations and political movements.

In October 2022, tribal fighting broke out on Kiriwina between the Kulumata and Kuboma people, reportedly triggered by a death during fighting at a football match. At least 30 people died. While fights between different groups were not uncommon, this was the first time they had resulted in a large number of deaths.

==Trobriand Islands in the modern day==
=== Growing population ===
Since 1975, the government of Papua New Guinea has had political control of the island, and its population has expanded quickly. More land has been cleared to accommodate the increasing population. Environmental problems such as deforestation are affecting the islands. The government often sends social workers to increase the use of birth control and contraception, but the Trobrianders are not receptive to outside influences dictating their reproductive norms. This means that sex is &quot;the most natural thing in the culture&quot;. Another effect of Trobriand promiscuity is the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS caused by foreigners on the island. The first documented case of HIV/AIDS was reported in 2001. HIV has become a major health problem. Since young Trobrianders often have multiple sexual partners before marriage, it is hard to slow the spread of the disease. &quot;The moralistic tropes of risk and promiscuity that dominate the language of HIV prevention are not easily accommodated by Trobriand ideations of sexuality, which celebrate premarital sexual activity as healthy and life-affirming, and which stress the productive values of reciprocity and relations of difference.&quot;

=== Income inequality ===
After statehood in 1975, the Trobriand Islands&#x27; economy was restructured to fit a tourist and export market. Most Trobrianders live on less than one dollar a day. Since food has been traditionally distributed among the people based on need, there has been little need for a currency-based economy outside of the Kula rings. To counteract this lack of hard currency, several western goods stores have opened on the islands and created most of the foreign goods market. These stores are multimillion-dollar enterprises. Most Trobrianders struggle to buy goods from these stores because they only take cash. Due to this practice, there are often reports of unrest because of a lack of funds. One remedy that many islanders seek is to sell cultural artifacts and relics to tourists in exchange for their currency. For example, a worker can spend 10 days working on a ceremonial turtle bowl and only get paid $10. &quot;This commercialization is often done sanctimoniously.&quot; &quot;They protect their cultural identity and use it as a tourist commodity&quot;. One imported item that causes economic and social problems is betel nuts. They are a major narcotic on the island. Due to this new currency-based economy there is more reported crime on the islands. There is a great economic disparity due to the income inequality between the modern world and the Trobriands. 
=== Education ===
In addition to missionary schools, there are public schools on the Trobriands that were introduced by the government of Papua New Guinea. &quot;All children are required to go to school&quot;. The required subjects are English, maths, science, and culture. Schools also educate students about current international events. Maths is the favorite subject among the students of the island. On Wednesdays, children are required to dress in traditional garb as part of the government-mandated culture day and encouraged to explore Trobriand culture, history and values.

=== Malinowski&#x27;s plaque in Kiriwina ===

There is a commemorative plaque dedicated to Bronisław Malinowski in Omarakana village, the residence village of the Paramount Chief of Trobriand Islands. The current chief, Pulayasi Daniel, says it is in the place where Malinowski&#x27;s tent stood at the beginning of the 20th century. There are two inscriptions on it, one in Polish and one in English, that say: &quot;Toboma Miskabati Bronislaw Malinowski (1884–1942) Notable scientist The son of the Polish nation Father of the modern social anthropology Friend of Trobriand Islands peoples and the populizer of their culture&quot;. The plaque was brought to Kiriwina by sailors Monika Bronicka and Mariusz Delgas, who took it from New Zealand, where it was left by two other yachts: &quot;Maria&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;. The plaque was sponsored by Jagiellonian University in Kraków and the National Museum in Szczecin, Poland.

=== Tourism and artist visits ===
The Trobriand Islands are South Sea islands that have so far been little developed for tourism. In 2012 the German painter Ingo Kühl made studies on the kula culture in Kiriwina and Port Moresby.

=== Calendar ===
The Trobriand Islands have a unique lunar calendar system. There are 12 or 13 lunar cycles, but only 10 are fixed: the others constitute free time. The calendar year begins with the sighting of a worm that appears to spawn, which initiates the Milamak festival. The concept of time on the islands is not linear, and the language has only one tense.

<doc id="407000" wikidata="Q2556531" url="?curid=407000" title="Weissenbacher–Zweymüller syndrome">
<text>Weissenbacher–Zweymuller syndrome (WZS), also called Pierre-Robin syndrome with fetal chondrodysplasia, is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder, linked to mutations (955 gly -&gt; glu) in the &quot;COL11A2&quot; gene (located on chromosomal position 6p21.3), which codes for the α2 strand of collagen type XI. It is a collagenopathy, types II and XI disorder. The condition was first characterized in 1964 by G. Weissenbacher and Ernst Zweymüller.

==Presentation==
The disorder causes facial abnormalities, skeletal malformation and occasionally neural tube defects; the skeletal disfigurements resolve to a degree in the course of development.

Mutations in different parts of the gene may lead to deafness or Stickler syndrome type III (myopia, retinal detachment and skeletal abnormalities).

Infants and children: Infants that are born with Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome usually have short bones in their arms and legs. The thigh and upper arm bones are wider than usual resulting in a dumbbell-shape while the bones of the vertebrae may be abnormal. Typical abnormal facial features can be wide-set protruding eyes (hypertelorism), a small and upturned nose with a flat bridge, small jaw (micrognathia) and a cleft palate. Some infants have high-frequency hearing loss. Infants may also exhibit a psychomotor delay. After the period of growth deficiency the individual makes improvements in bone growth leading to a normal physical development around age 5 or 6.

Adults: Many with Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome have a catch-up growth phase causing the adults to not be unusually short. Many adults still will have hearing loss and typical abnormal facial features of Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome.

==Causes==

Dominant genetic disorders can be caused by just a single copy of an abnormal gene. This abnormal gene can be the result of being inherited from either parent or be a new mutation. Most cases are caused by a de novo (new) mutation in the gene that occurs during the formation of the egg or sperm. These cases occur when there is no history of the disorder in the family.
The COL11A2 gene is responsible for providing instructions on making one component of the type XI collagen. Type XI collagen is a complex molecule that helps give structure and strength to the connective tissues. Collagen is found in bone. It is also found in cartilage that makes up most of the skeleton during early development. The mutation of COL11A2 in Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome disrupts the assembly of the type XI collagen molecules. The malfunctioning collagen weakens the connective tissue causing impaired bone development.
COL11A2 is also associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL). All mutations of COL11A2 in ADNSHL are missense mutations.

==Diagnosis==

Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome is diagnosed upon a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptom and a variety of specialized tests which includes x-rays.

==Treatment==

Because there is no cure, treatment is directed towards the specific symptoms that are present in each individual.

==Epidemiology==

Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome affects males and females in the same numbers. About 30 cases have been reported in medical literature. The disorder can be underdiagnosed causing no true frequency in the population.

<text>John William Meriwether (born August 10, 1947) is an American hedge fund executive.

==Education==
Meriwether earned an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University and an MBA degree from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

==Salomon Brothers==
After graduation, Meriwether moved to New York City, where he worked as a bond trader at Salomon Brothers. At Salomon, Meriwether rose to become the head of the domestic fixed income arbitrage group in the early 1980s and vice-chairman of the company in 1988. In 1991, Salomon was caught in a Treasury securities trading scandal perpetrated by a Meriwether subordinate, Paul Mozer. Meriwether was assessed $50,000 in civil penalties.

==LTCM==
Meriwether founded the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1994. The fund collapsed in 1998. The books &quot;When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management&quot; and &quot;Inventing Money: The Story of Long-Term Capital Management and the Legends Behind It&quot; detail the events leading up to and following Long-Term Capital Management&#x27;s demise.

==JWM Partners==
A year after LTCM&#x27;s collapse, in 1999, Meriwether founded JWM Partners LLC. The hedge fund opened with $250 million under management and by 2007 had approximately $3 billion. From September 2007 to February 2009, during the Great Recession, his main fund lost 44%. On July 8, 2009, Meriwether closed the fund.

==JM Advisors==
Meriwether opened his third hedge fund, named JM Advisors Management, in 2010. The fund is expected to use similar strategies as both LTCM and JWM, namely highly leveraged &quot;relative value arbitrage&quot;. By March 2011, however, the JM Advisors Macro Fund had raised only $28.85 million. 

==Thoroughbred racing==
Meriwether has been an owner of thoroughbred horses for a number of years and is a member of the board of directors of the New York Racing Association (NYRA). He notably campaigned Buckhan, the winner of the 1993 Washington, D.C. International Stakes.

<doc id="407018" wikidata="Q782849" url="?curid=407018" title="Australia in the War in Afghanistan">
<text>The Australian contribution to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|war in Afghanistan]] has been known as Operation Slipper (2001–2014) and Operation Highroad (2015–2021).

Australian Defence Force (ADF) operations and the size of the forces deployed have varied and ADF involvement has included two major areas of activity: Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf. These activities have seen the deployment of naval, air and land forces that have taken part in combat and combat support operations as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).

In mid-2014, the naval and logistic support operations in the Persian Gulf were re-designated as Operation Manitou and Operation Accordion respectively.

==Operation Slipper==
Operation Slipper began in late 2001 and ended on 31 December 2014.

===First phase===

During the first phase of Operation Slipper, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) commitment to Afghanistan consisted of a Special Forces Task Group and two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Boeing 707 air-to-air refuelling aircraft from No. 33 Squadron. These aircraft and associated support personnel operated from Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan and provided support to coalition aircraft operating in Afghan airspace. Two RAAF AP-3C Orion aircraft flew maritime patrol missions in support of maritime interdiction operations in the Persian Gulf. These aircraft were temporarily retasked to Operations Falconer and Catalyst in 2003.

RAAF C-130 Hercules transport aircraft were also involved in providing logistic support for deployed forces. The Special Forces were involved with the establishment of the US-led coalition&#x27;s first Forward Operating Base (Camp Rhino) southwest of Kandahar in November 2001, followed by the capture of Kandahar International Airport in December 2001. The initial ADF commitment in Afghanistan concluded in December 2002 when the Special Air Service Task Group was withdrawn. Following this date until 2005 Australia&#x27;s total contribution to efforts in Afghanistan were two officers attached to the United Nations and the Coalition land mine clearing force.

All three squadrons of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) were deployed to Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002. The dates of these deployments were:
* 1 Squadron Group, SASR: (October 2001 – April 2002)
* 3 Squadron Group, SASR: (April 2002 – August 2002)
* 2 Squadron Group, SASR: (August 2002 – November 2002)

===Second phase===
An Australian Special Forces Task Group was re-deployed to Afghanistan in August or September 2005. This Task Group consisted of elements from the SASR, 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando), the Incident Response Regiment and logistic support personnel. As well as heavily modified Land Rovers, the Special Forces Task Group was also equipped with some Bushmaster infantry mobility vehicles. A detachment of two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment was deployed to Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the Special Forces Task Group. The Australian Special Forces Task Group was withdrawn from Afghanistan in September 2006 and the helicopter detachment returned to Australia in April 2007.

===Third phase===
A Reconstruction Taskforce-based around the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment with protective elements from the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and 2nd Cavalry Regiment began arriving in Uruzgan Province in southern Afghanistan in early September 2006. The Australian Reconstruction Taskforce formed part of a Dutch-led Provincial Reconstruction Team, operating as part of the Dutch-led Task Force Uruzgan and based at Forward Operating Base Ripley, outside of Tarin Kowt.

A 300-strong Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007, including a Commando company-group, elements of the SASR, and an integral combat service support team. In addition to radar crews, logistics and intelligence officers, and security personnel, this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid-2007, with further small increases to 1,000 in mid-2008, 1,100 in early 2009 and 1,550 in mid-2009. These increases occurred in spite of opinion polls indicating that public support for the deployment was decreasing, with a poll released in September 2008 finding that a majority of those surveyed were opposed to Australia&#x27;s continued military involvement in the country.

In early 2009, a number of Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) were embedded into the Afghan National Army battalions serving in the 4th (ANA) Brigade, 205th Hero Corps, in Uruzgan as part of the Australian mission to mentor and partner the ANA within the province. Consequently, the RTF was renamed the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force. On 16 January 2009, Trooper Mark Donaldson, a member of the SASR, was awarded Australia&#x27;s highest gallantry medal, the Victoria Cross for Australia. Donaldson was awarded the medal for exposing himself to enemy fire to protect injured Australian troops and then rescuing an Afghan interpreter under heavy enemy fire during a contact on 2 September 2008.

A modest Australian force remained in Afghanistan over this period and was involved in counter-insurgency operations in Uruzgan province in conjunction with Dutch, US and other coalition forces. MRTF was again renamed to the Mentoring Task Force in early 2010. Based around a combined arms battalion-sized battle group, it consisted of motorised infantry and cavalry force elements supported by engineers, as well as coalition enablers including artillery and aviation assets. The Rotary Wing Group flying CH-47D Chinooks, the Force Logistics Asset and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit were also based in Kandahar. A further 800 Australian logistic personnel were also based outside of Afghanistan, in locations in the Middle East. Meanwhile, detachments of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, based out of Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates.

===Order of battle===
Over the course of the operation, as the size of Australia&#x27;s contribution has fluctuated and the scope of operations undertaken has evolved, the number and type of units deployed has also changed. A snapshot of the order of battle from March 2011, when approximately 1,550 Australians were deployed to Afghanistan, is as follows:
*National Command Element
**Mentoring Task Force 2 (MTF-2)
***Headquarters, 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5 RAR)
***4 x Combat Teams including infantry, cavalry, engineers and offensive support
***5 x Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams
***Force Communications Unit IV (1st Combat Signal Regiment)
***Logistics and support units
**Detachment, 20th Surveillance and Target Acquisition Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery (operates ScanEagle UAVs)
**Special Operations Task Group
***Elements of the SASR, 2nd Commando Regiment, Reserve 1 Commando Regiment and Special Operations Engineer Regiment
**Rotary Wing Group (including two CH-47D Chinooks helicopters).
**Detachment, 1st Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery (16 gunners attached to the British Army)
**RAAF Control and Reporting Centre (Kandahar International Airport)
** Two AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft and three C-130 Hercules transports
**Personnel embedded with various coalition units
**Force Level Logistic Asset (Kandahar International Airport)

===Departure of Australian combat forces===
At the end of October 2013, Prime Minister Tony Abbott traveled to Afghanistan with Opposition Leader Bill Shorten for a special ceremony at the Australian base in Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan. He told a gathering of troops and Afghan leaders that &quot;Australia&#x27;s longest war is ending. Not with victory, not with defeat, but with, we hope, an Afghanistan that is better for our presence here.&quot; Afghan forces were scheduled to take over running of the camp in mid-December. The last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013; however, approximately 400 personnel remained in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers, and were stationed in Kandahar and Kabul.

On 1 July 2014, as part of the restructuring of Australian operations in the Middle East, Operation Slipper was split into three different operations: ongoing operations in Afghanistan as part of ISAF under Operation Slipper; maritime security operations in the Middle East and counter piracy in the Gulf of Aden under Operation Manitou; and support operations to Slipper and Manitou from a number of locations in the Gulf States, primarily the United Arab Emirates, under Operation Accordion. Approximately 400 personnel were deployed on Operation Slipper, another 550 as part of Accordion, and 250 on Manitou. Australian operations in Afghanistan were scheduled to continue until the ISAF mission concluded in December 2014, while its contribution to the NATO-led &quot;train, advise, assist&quot; mission post-2014 was still to be confirmed at that time. The final Heron UAV detachment left Afghanistan in December 2014.

Operation Slipper concluded on 31 December 2014, with Australia&#x27;s &quot;train, advise and assist&quot; mission in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission being conducted under the code-name Operation Highroad after this date. Approximately 400 Australian personnel were deployed as part of the new mission, including personnel in mentoring and advisory roles, as well as medical personnel, force protection and logistic support. Over 26,000 Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan.

In June 2018, ABC News published photographs depicting Australian soldiers flying Nazi swastikas on their vehicles in Afghanistan. Their actions were subsequently denounced by then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

===War crimes inquiry===

In May 2016 the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force, Major General Paul Brereton, launched an inquiry into allegations that some Australian special forces personnel committed war crimes in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016. In February 2020 it was announced that 55 incidents were being investigated and, in November 2020, the inspector-general concluded that 36 incidents ought to be referred to the Australian Federal Police for criminal investigation and possible prosecution by the Department of Home Affairs&#x27; Office of the Special Investigator and Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.

According to Brereton&#x27;s report, there is credible information that 25 Australian Defence Force personnel were involved in serious crimes in Afghanistan. Of the soldiers, 19 were directly implicated in the murder of 39 prisoners and civilians, and cruel treatment of 2 others, while the other military personnel were believed to be accessories to the incidents. Brereton noted that some of the soldiers were ordered by their patrol commanders to kill prisoners. Some soldiers are also believed to have planted evidence next to civilian corpses to imply that the civilians were armed, and thus could be classified as legitimate targets in post-incident investigations. The report describes a 2012 incident as having been &quot;possibly the most disgraceful episode in Australia&#x27;s military history&quot;, but the specifics were redacted in the version released to the public.

Upon the report&#x27;s release, Chief of the Australian Defence Force, General Angus Campbell, apologised for &quot;any wrongdoing by Australian soldiers&quot;. He announced that the 2nd Squadron of the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) would be disbanded as a result of the investigation, citing a &quot;distorted culture&quot; that undermined the moral authority of the Australian Defence Force, through all three SASR squadrons were implicated in poor conduct.) According to one reporter&#x27;s correspondence with a former patrol commander, &quot;EVERYONE KNEW [emphasis in the original]&quot; that war crimes had been committed, but when it was reported regiment leadership decided to handle the matter internally. General Campbell also explained that he and the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Rick Burr, would take further action with respect to the commanders of units apparently involved in war crimes.

Journalist Mark Willacy estimates that prosecutions related to these findings may not be concluded until approximately the year 2030.

===Final withdrawal===

A contingent of around 80 ADF personnel remained in Afghanistan as late as 2021 to train and advise Afghan forces. The Australian embassy in Kabul was closed on 28 May that year. The last ADF personnel and diplomats in Afghanistan departed on 18 June 2021. This formed part of the withdrawal of international forces from the country.

Following the fall of Kabul in August 2021, ADF personnel were used to evacuate Australians and Afghans who had assisted the Australian forces from Afghanistan. Three RAAF aircraft and 250 personnel were deployed from Australia to the Middle East as part of this effort. The first evacuation flight from Kabul took place on the night of 17/18 August. Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that it would not be possible to evacuate all the Afghans who had assisted the Australian forces due to the situation in the country.

==Persian Gulf==
Since October 2001 the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) has maintained a continuous presence in and around Iraqi territorial waters as part of Operation Slipper and subsequent operations. There were four major rotations of RAN ships to this area of operations between December 2001 and March 2003. The primary focus of these rotations was to conduct Maritime Interception Operations as part of a US, Australian and British force enforcing United Nations Security Council resolutions against Iraq. The first rotation consisted of Her Majesty&#x27;s Australian Ships (HMAS) &quot;Sydney&quot;, &quot;Adelaide&quot; and &quot;Kanimbla&quot;. These ships were followed in February 2002 by HMA Ships &quot;Canberra&quot;, &quot;Newcastle&quot; and &quot;Manoora&quot; and again in July 2002 by HMAS &quot;Arunta&quot; and &quot;Melbourne&quot;.

HMAS &quot;Kanimbla&quot; departed from Sydney, Australia on 20 January 2003 again bound for the Persian Gulf under the mission objectives of Operation Bastille. On arriving in Bahrain on 16 February she reverted to the original mission objects of Operation Slipper (that of enforcing UN sanctions against Iraq). On 20 March 2003, HMA Ships &quot;Kanimbla&quot;, &quot;Anzac&quot; and &quot;Darwin&quot; participated in the combat phase of the 2003 Iraq War, codenamed Operation Falconer; in April &quot;Kanimbla&quot; supported Operation Baghdad Assist, delivering medical supplies that were transported to Baghdad. During these operations the Australian ships pioneered a number of techniques that increased the effectiveness of Maritime Interception Force operations leading to them intercepting and boarding about 1,700 vessels in this period. Four Australian naval officers commanded the multinational force at various times during the course of the operation. Detachments from the Army&#x27;s 16th Air Defence Regiment provided point defence to the &quot;Kanimbla&quot; and &quot;Manoora&quot; during their deployments.

From 2009 Australian warships and aircraft in the Middle East have also been involved in counter-piracy operations and maritime interdiction off the Horn of Africa as part of Combined Task Force 151.

==Diego Garcia==
A detachment of four Australian F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft provided air defence for the US military base on the island of Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory during the campaign against the Taliban. The initial detachment was provided by No. 77 Squadron RAAF between December 2001 and 10 February 2002. This was replaced by a detachment from No. 3 Squadron RAAF which was deployed between 10 February 2002 and 20 May 2002. No further Australian units were deployed to Diego Garcia.

==Casualties==
Operation Slipper is notable for the first Australian combat deaths since the Vietnam War, and to date all casualties have occurred during operations in Afghanistan. 41 Australian soldiers have been killed and 261 wounded, the majority since October 2007. Another Australian was killed while serving with the British Army.

In 2008, the song &quot;The Teacher&quot; was included on the Grand Theft Auto IV in-game radio soundtrack; it is a remix of the hit song &quot;Forelska i Lærer&#x27;n&quot; by the Norwegian rock band The Kids.

<doc id="407028" wikidata="Q2890157" url="?curid=407028" title="Mahmoud Tawalbe">
<text>Mahmoud Tawalbe (; c. 1979 - 2002) was the head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Jenin, one of the main strongholds of the Militant organization.

Tawalbe was involved in many attacks against Israelis but he was best known for being the leader of the Palestinian militants in Jenin during the Battle of Jenin, part of Israel&#x27;s 2002 Operation Defensive Shield.

The Israeli authorities had 23-year-old Mahmoud Tawalbe, a father of two who worked in a record store but also headed the local Palestinian Islamic Jihad cell, at the top of their &quot;wanted&quot; list. Tawalbe was responsible for numerous attacks against Israelis, including an October 2001 shooting on the main street of Hadera, north of Tel Aviv, which killed four women. Tawalbe had dispatched his 19-year-old brother Murad on a suicide attack to Haifa in the July of that year, though Murad lost his nerve and surrendered to Israel Police. Other top Islamic Jihad targets in Jenin included Thabet Mardawi, behind a March 20 suicide bomb that killed seven Israelis on a bus, and Ali Suleiman al-Saadi, known as Safouri, who had planned a November shooting that killed two Israelis.

Tawalbe was one of the commanders in the battle over Jenin. Tawalbe ordered supporters to booby trap the entire camp in order to kill as many Israeli soldiers as possible. Even children took part in the bomb-making efforts.

During a break from the fighting on the seventh day, Tawalbe sneaked out of the camp into neighbouring Jenin to visit his mother and brother. His brother told &quot;Time&quot; that &quot;Mahmoud looked pleased with his work&quot;, and he told his mother &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about me...I feel strong&quot;. The camp lore says Mahmoud killed 13 Israelis in the fighting.

&quot;Time&quot; visited the rubble of the house where Tawalbe died with a British military expert working in the camp for Amnesty International, David Holley. They reported that &quot;the three-story structure shows signs of attack from two directions. One wall was charred by fire; the wall on the other side had collapsed.&quot; Holley deduced from the tank tracks and bomb craters that Tawalbe was killed by an alert IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer whose operator thwarted an attempt by Tawalbe and his gunmen to plant a bomb on the armour of a passing Israeli Armored fighting vehicle, probably by ramming the wall onto him.

After the battle of Jenin, Mahmoud Tawalbe was considered a hero by many Palestinians and Arabs worldwide. His mangled corpse was interred together with that of his fellow militant due to the difficulty in identifying the bodies, in Jenin&#x27;s &quot;Martyrs&#x27; Cemetery&quot;. Tawalbe was labeled &quot;general of the martyrs&quot; in posters throughout the camp, and marching children chanted his name.

<text>Elisha Haydon Collier (1788–1856) of Boston, Massachusetts, invented a flintlock revolver around 1814. His weapon is one of the earliest true revolvers, after the 1739&#x27;s revolver of Iaumandreu from Manresa and 1702&#x27;s of Rovira from Ripoll, exhibited in the Armouries of the Tower of London, in contrast to the earlier pepperboxes which were multi-barreled guns. Collier&#x27;s revolver was not self rotating but it was self-priming: a compartment automatically released gunpowder into the pan when the hammer was cocked.

== Gunmaking ==

It was patented in 1818, produced from 1819 by John Evans &amp; Son of London, and purchased by European officers in the presidency armies. Over 10,000 of value (approximately 160 long guns) in pound sterling was supposedly to be made and contracted for India according to Elisha H. Collier&#x27;s testimony in the 1851 Colt vs. Massachusetts Arms Company patent infringement trial of 1851 (J. Harrison – The Gun Collector Number 35 Feb 1951, pp. 553–555.) but further on in testimony was diminished by Mr. Collier suggesting that this number was only anticipated. It is known that there are but approximately 225 Collier pistols and long guns were made between 1819 and 1824, according to known serial numbers between the three types. A single barrel allowed greater accuracy and a faster reload time while reducing unnecessary weight. However, its flintlock action was a serious drawback: flints were unreliable and had to be changed frequently, while inferior quality powder risked a misfire.

Samuel Colt saw weapons of this type while serving as a cabin boy aboard the brig &quot;Corvo&quot; in 1832. Following his return from the Far East he was inspired to create his own caplock revolver: the Colt Paterson.

In addition to handguns, Collier produced revolving shotguns and carbines in the 1820s. Only 150 of these now rare guns were made.

== Other activities ==
In the 1830s, Collier invented a new boiler for steam ships. He wrote a book on the subject, which was published in 1836. In 1839 Collier designed a machine for mass-producing nails for the Globe Dock Factory, Rotherhithe, Surrey.

== Later life ==
Collier lived in England from 1818 until 1850, when he returned to Boston, Massachusetts. By this time Colt&#x27;s cheaper mass-produced revolvers had supplanted his earlier, hand made designs. Collier is listed as having lived at 88 Eliot Street in an 1850 census, where he died on January 23, 1856.

<doc id="407039" wikidata="Q2007878" url="?curid=407039" title="Functor category">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a functor category formula_1 is a category where the objects are the functors formula_2 and the morphisms are natural transformations formula_3 between the functors (here, formula_4 is another object in the category). Functor categories are of interest for two main reasons: 
* many commonly occurring categories are (disguised) functor categories, so any statement proved for general functor categories is widely applicable;
* every category embeds in a functor category (via the Yoneda embedding); the functor category often has nicer properties than the original category, allowing certain operations that were not available in the original setting.

== Definition ==
Suppose formula_5 is a small category (i.e. the objects and morphisms form a set rather than a proper class) and formula_6 is an arbitrary category. 
The category of functors from formula_5 to formula_6, written as Fun(formula_5, formula_6), Funct(formula_5,formula_6), formula_13, or formula_14, has as objects the covariant functors from formula_5 to formula_6, 
and as morphisms the natural transformations between such functors. Note that natural transformations can be composed: 
if formula_17 is a natural transformation from the functor formula_18 to the functor formula_19, and 
formula_20 is a natural transformation from the functor formula_21 to the functor formula_22, then the composition formula_23 defines a natural transformation 
from formula_24 to formula_22. With this composition of natural transformations (known as vertical composition, see natural transformation), 
formula_1 satisfies the axioms of a category.

In a completely analogous way, one can also consider the category of all &quot;contravariant&quot; functors from formula_5 to formula_6; we write this as Funct(formula_29).

If formula_5 and formula_6 are both preadditive categories (i.e. their morphism sets are abelian groups and the composition of morphisms is bilinear), 
then we can consider the category of all additive functors from formula_5 to formula_6, denoted by Add(formula_5,formula_6).

== Examples ==
* If formula_36 is a small discrete category (i.e. its only morphisms are the identity morphisms), then a functor from formula_36 to formula_5 essentially consists of a family of objects of formula_5, indexed by formula_36; the functor category formula_41 can be identified with the corresponding product category: its elements are families of objects in formula_5 and its morphisms are families of morphisms in formula_5.

* An arrow category formula_44 (whose objects are the morphisms of formula_45, and whose morphisms are commuting squares in formula_45) is just formula_47, where 2 is the category with two objects and their identity morphisms as well as an arrow from one object to the other (but not another arrow back the other way).
* A directed graph consists of a set of arrows and a set of vertices, and two functions from the arrow set to the vertex set, specifying each arrow&#x27;s start and end vertex. The category of all directed graphs is thus nothing but the functor category formula_48, where formula_5 is the category with two objects connected by two parallel morphisms (source and target), and Set denotes the category of sets.
* Any group formula_21 can be considered as a one-object category in which every morphism is invertible. The category of all formula_21-sets is the same as the functor category Setformula_21. Natural transformations are formula_21-maps.
* Similar to the previous example, the category of &quot;K&quot;-linear representations of the group formula_21 is the same as the functor category Vect&quot;K&quot;formula_21 (where Vect&quot;K&quot; denotes the category of all vector spaces over the field &quot;K&quot;).
* Any ring formula_56 can be considered as a one-object preadditive category; the category of left modules over formula_56 is the same as the additive functor category Add(formula_56,formula_59) (where formula_59 denotes the category of abelian groups), and the category of right formula_56-modules is Add(formula_62,formula_59). Because of this example, for any preadditive category formula_5, the category Add(formula_5,formula_59) is sometimes called the &quot;category of left modules over formula_5&quot; and Add(formula_68,formula_59) is the &quot;category of right modules over formula_5&quot;.
* The category of presheaves on a topological space formula_71 is a functor category: we turn the topological space into a category formula_5 having the open sets in formula_71 as objects and a single morphism from formula_74 to formula_75 if and only if formula_74 is contained in formula_75. The category of presheaves of sets (abelian groups, rings) on formula_71 is then the same as the category of contravariant functors from formula_5 to formula_80 (or formula_59 or formula_82). Because of this example, the category Funct(formula_68, formula_80) is sometimes called the &quot;category of presheaves of sets on formula_5&quot; even for general categories formula_5 not arising from a topological space. To define sheaves on a general category formula_5, one needs more structure: a Grothendieck topology on formula_5. (Some authors refer to categories that are equivalent to formula_48 as &quot;presheaf categories&quot;.)

== Facts ==
Most constructions that can be carried out in formula_6 can also be carried out in formula_1 by performing them &quot;componentwise&quot;, separately for 
each object in formula_5. For instance, if any two objects formula_71 and formula_94 in formula_6 have a product formula_96, 
then any two functors formula_24 and formula_21 in formula_1 have a product formula_100, defined by formula_101 
for every object formula_102 in formula_5. Similarly, if formula_104 is a natural transformation and each formula_105 has a kernel formula_106 in the category formula_6, 
then the kernel of formula_108 in the functor category formula_1 is the functor formula_110 with formula_111 for every object formula_102 in formula_5.

As a consequence we have the general rule of thumb that the functor category formula_1 shares most of the &quot;nice&quot; properties of formula_6:
* if formula_6 is complete (or cocomplete), then so is formula_1;
* if formula_6 is an abelian category, then so is formula_1;

We also have:
* if formula_5 is any small category, then the category formula_48 of presheaves is a topos.

So from the above examples, we can conclude right away that the categories of directed graphs, formula_21-sets and presheaves on a topological space are all complete and cocomplete topoi, and that the categories of representations of formula_21, modules over the ring formula_56, 
and presheaves of abelian groups on a topological space formula_71 are all abelian, complete and cocomplete.

The embedding of the category formula_5 in a functor category that was mentioned earlier uses the Yoneda lemma as its main tool. For every object formula_71 of formula_5, 
let formula_129 be the contravariant representable functor from formula_5 to formula_80. The Yoneda lemma states that the assignment 
:formula_132
is a full embedding of the category formula_5 into the category Funct(formula_68,formula_80). So formula_5 naturally sits inside a topos.

The same can be carried out for any preadditive category formula_5: Yoneda then yields a full embedding of formula_5 into the functor category Add(formula_68,formula_59). 
So formula_5 naturally sits inside an abelian category.

The intuition mentioned above (that constructions that can be carried out in formula_6 can be &quot;lifted&quot; to formula_1) can be made precise in several ways; the most succinct formulation uses the language of adjoint functors. 
Every functor formula_144 induces a functor formula_145 (by composition with formula_24). If formula_24 and formula_21 is a pair of adjoint functors, then formula_149 and formula_150 is also a pair of adjoint functors.

The functor category formula_1 has all the formal properties of an exponential object; in particular the functors from formula_152 
stand in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the functors from formula_153 to formula_1. The category formula_155 of all small categories with functors as morphisms 
is therefore a cartesian closed category.

<text>In photography, a negative is an image, usually on a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film, in which the lightest areas of the photographed subject appear darkest and the darkest areas appear lightest. This reversed order occurs because the extremely light-sensitive chemicals a camera film must use to capture an image quickly enough for ordinary picture-taking are darkened, rather than bleached, by exposure to light and subsequent photographic processing.

In the case of color negatives, the colors are also reversed into their respective complementary colors. Typical color negatives have an overall dull orange tint due to an automatic color-masking feature that ultimately results in improved color reproduction.

Negatives are normally used to make positive prints on photographic paper by projecting the negative onto the paper with a photographic enlarger or making a contact print. The paper is also darkened in proportion to its exposure to light, so a second reversal results which restores light and dark to their normal order.

Negatives were once commonly made on a thin sheet of glass rather than a plastic film, and some of the earliest negatives were made on paper.

Transparent positive prints can be made by printing a negative onto special positive film, as is done to make traditional motion picture film prints for use in theaters. Some films used in cameras are designed to be developed by reversal processing, which produces the final positive, instead of a negative, on the original film. Positives on film or glass are known as transparencies or diapositives, and if mounted in small frames designed for use in a slide projector or magnifying viewer they are commonly called slides.

==Negative image==

A positive image is a normal image. A negative image is a total inversion, in which light areas appear dark and vice versa. A negative color image is additionally color-reversed, with red areas appearing cyan, greens appearing magenta, and blues appearing yellow, and vice versa.

Under a phenomenon known as the ‘negative picture illusion’, a negative image can be briefly experienced by the human visual system where an afterimage persists subsequent to a prolonged gaze.

Film negatives usually have less contrast, but a wider dynamic range, than the final printed positive images. The contrast typically increases when they are printed onto photographic paper. When negative film images are brought into the digital realm, their contrast may be adjusted at the time of scanning or, more usually, during subsequent post-processing.

==Negative film==

Film for cameras that use the 35 mm still format is sold as a long strip of emulsion-coated and perforated plastic spooled in a light-tight cassette. Before each exposure, a mechanism inside the camera is used to pull an unexposed area of the strip out of the cassette and into position behind the camera lens. When all exposures have been made the strip is rewound into the cassette. After the film is chemically developed, the strip shows a series of small negative images. It is usually then cut into sections for easier handling. Medium format cameras use 120 film, which yields a strip of negatives 60 mm wide, and large format cameras capture each image on a single sheet of film which may be as large as 20 x 25 cm (8 x 10 inches) or even larger. Each of these photographed images may be referred to as a negative and an entire strip or set of images may be collectively referred to as &quot;the negatives&quot;. They are the master images, from which all positive prints will derive, so they are handled and stored with special care.

Many photographic processes create negative images: the chemicals involved react when exposed to light, so that during development they produce deposits of microscopic dark silver particles or colored dyes in proportion to the amount of exposure. However, when a negative image is created from a negative image (just like multiplying two negative numbers in mathematics) a positive image results. This makes most chemical-based photography a two-step process, which uses negative film and ordinary processing. Special films and development processes have been devised so that positive images can be created directly on the film; these are called positive, or slide, or (perhaps confusingly) reversal films and reversal processing.

Despite the market&#x27;s evolution away from film, there is still a desire and market for products which allow fine art photographers to produce negatives from digital images for their use in alternative processes such as cyanotypes, gum bichromate, platinum prints, and many others. Such negative images, however, can have less permanence and less accuracy in reproduction than their digital counterparts.

==Negative images and digital processing==

A negative image can allow a different perception of an everyday scene perhaps highlighting spatial relationships and details that are less obvious in the positive image. For example, the photographer Andrew Prokos has produced an award-winning series of photographs under the “inverted” banner. The advent of digital image processing has expanded the possibilities. In a physical photograph the colour and luminance can only be inverted in tandem, but digital processing allows each to be inverted separately. If the hue of an image is rotated by 180 degrees, then the colour of the image is inverted but not its luminance. The negative of such an image has the luminance inverted but not the colour. Whereas a physical image can be either ‘inverted’ or ‘not inverted’, a digital image can exhibit a partial degree of colour inversion in so far as the hue can be altered by plus or minus some number of degrees which is greater than zero degrees but less than 180 degrees.

<text>In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, Morera&#x27;s theorem, named after Giacinto Morera, gives an important criterion for proving that a function is holomorphic.

Morera&#x27;s theorem states that a continuous, complex-valued function &quot;f&quot; defined on an open set &quot;D&quot; in the complex plane that satisfies
formula_1
for every closed piecewise &quot;C&quot;1 curve formula_2 in &quot;D&quot; must be holomorphic on &quot;D&quot;.

The assumption of Morera&#x27;s theorem is equivalent to &quot;f&quot; having an antiderivative on &quot;D&quot;.

The converse of the theorem is not true in general. A holomorphic function need not possess an antiderivative on its domain, unless one imposes additional assumptions. The converse does hold e.g. if the domain is simply connected; this is Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem, stating that the line integral of a holomorphic function along a closed curve is zero. 

The standard counterexample is the function , which is holomorphic on C − {0}. On any simply connected neighborhood U in C − {0}, 1/&quot;z&quot; has an antiderivative defined by , where . Because of the ambiguity of &quot;θ&quot; up to the addition of any integer multiple of 2, any continuous choice of &quot;θ&quot; on &quot;U&quot; will suffice to define an antiderivative of 1/&quot;z&quot; on &quot;U&quot;. (It is the fact that &quot;θ&quot; cannot be defined continuously on a simple closed curve containing the origin in its interior that is the root of why 1/&quot;z&quot; has no antiderivative on its entire domain C − {0}.) And because the derivative of an additive constant is 0, any constant may be added to the antiderivative and the result will still be an antiderivative of 1/&quot;z&quot;.

In a certain sense, the 1/&quot;z&quot; counterexample is universal: For every analytic function that has no antiderivative on its domain, the reason for this is that 1/&quot;z&quot; itself does not have an antiderivative on C − {0}.

==Proof==
There is a relatively elementary proof of the theorem. One constructs an anti-derivative for &quot;f&quot; explicitly.

Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that &quot;D&quot; is connected. Fix a point &quot;z&quot;0 in &quot;D&quot;, and for any formula_3, let formula_4 be a piecewise &quot;C&quot;1 curve such that formula_5 and formula_6. Then define the function &quot;F&quot; to be
formula_7

To see that the function is well-defined, suppose formula_8 is another piecewise &quot;C&quot;1 curve such that formula_9 and formula_10. The curve formula_11 (i.e. the curve combining formula_2 with formula_13 in reverse) is a closed piecewise &quot;C&quot;1 curve in &quot;D&quot;. Then,
formula_14

And it follows that
formula_15

Then using the continuity of &quot;f&quot; to estimate difference quotients, we get that &quot;F&quot;′(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;). Had we chosen a different &quot;z&quot;0 in &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot; would change by a constant: namely, the result of integrating &quot;f&quot; along &quot;any&quot; piecewise regular curve between the new &quot;z&quot;0 and the old, and this does not change the derivative.

Since &quot;f&quot; is the derivative of the holomorphic function &quot;F&quot;, it is holomorphic. The fact that derivatives of holomorphic functions are holomorphic can be proved by using the fact that holomorphic functions are analytic, i.e. can be represented by a convergent power series, and the fact that power series may be differentiated term by term. This completes the proof.

==Applications==
Morera&#x27;s theorem is a standard tool in complex analysis. It is used in almost any argument that involves a non-algebraic construction of a holomorphic function.

===Uniform limits===
For example, suppose that &quot;f&quot;1, &quot;f&quot;2, ... is a sequence of holomorphic functions, converging uniformly to a continuous function &quot;f&quot; on an open disc. By Cauchy&#x27;s theorem, we know that
formula_16
for every &quot;n&quot;, along any closed curve &quot;C&quot; in the disc. Then the uniform convergence implies that
formula_17
for every closed curve &quot;C&quot;, and therefore by Morera&#x27;s theorem &quot;f&quot; must be holomorphic. This fact can be used to show that, for any open set , the set of all bounded, analytic functions is a Banach space with respect to the supremum norm.

===Infinite sums and integrals===
Morera&#x27;s theorem can also be used in conjunction with Fubini&#x27;s theorem and the Weierstrass M-test to show the analyticity of functions defined by sums or integrals, such as the Riemann zeta function
formula_18
or the Gamma function
formula_19

Specifically one shows that
formula_20
for a suitable closed curve &quot;C&quot;, by writing
formula_21
and then using Fubini&#x27;s theorem to justify changing the order of integration, getting
formula_22

Then one uses the analyticity of to conclude that
formula_23
and hence the double integral above is 0. Similarly, in the case of the zeta function, the M-test justifies interchanging the integral along the closed curve and the sum.

==Weakening of hypotheses==
The hypotheses of Morera&#x27;s theorem can be weakened considerably. In particular, it suffices for the integral
formula_24
to be zero for every closed (solid) triangle &quot;T&quot; contained in the region &quot;D&quot;. This in fact characterizes holomorphy, i.e. &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic on &quot;D&quot; if and only if the above conditions hold. It also implies the following generalisation of the aforementioned fact about uniform limits of holomorphic functions: if &quot;f&quot;1, &quot;f&quot;2, ... is a sequence of holomorphic functions defined on an open set that converges to a function &quot;f&quot; uniformly on compact subsets of Ω, then &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic.

<text>Simon Lake (September 4, 1866 – June 23, 1945) was a Quaker American mechanical engineer and naval architect who obtained over two hundred patents for advances in naval design and competed with John Philip Holland to build the first submarines for the United States Navy.

==Biography==
Born in Pleasantville, New Jersey on September 4, 1866. He studied at the Clinton Liberal Institute in Fort Plain, New York. Lake joined his father&#x27;s foundry business after attending public schools in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Lake had a strong interest in undersea travel.

He built his first submarine, &quot;Argonaut Junior&quot;, in 1894 in response to an 1893 request from the US Navy for a submarine torpedo boat. In 1898 he followed up with the &quot;Argonaut 1&quot;, which he sailed from Norfolk, Virginia for to Sandy Hook, New Jersey (which is actually north of Norfolk), arriving in November 1898. As a result of lessons learned on that journey, he rebuilt it into the &quot;Argonaut 2&quot;.

Neither &quot;Argonaut&quot; nor Lake&#x27;s following submarine, &quot;Protector&quot;, built in 1901, were accepted by the Navy. &quot;Protector&quot; was the first submarine to have diving planes mounted forward of the conning tower and a flat keel. Four diving planes allowed &quot;Protector&quot; to maintain depth without changing ballast tank levels, and to dive level without a down-angle. Level diving was a feature of several subsequent Lake designs, notably the first three US G-class submarines. &quot;Protector&quot; also had a lock-out chamber for divers to leave the submarine. Lake, lacking Holland&#x27;s financial backing, was unable to continue building submarines in the United States. He sold &quot;Protector&quot; to Imperial Russia in 1904 as the &quot;Osetr&quot; and spent the next seven years in Europe designing submarines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;, and the Imperial Russian Navy (&quot;Osetr&quot;- and &quot;Kaiman&quot;-class submarines).

He lived in Milford, Connecticut from 1907 until his death in 1945. In 1912, he founded the Lake Torpedo Boat Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut, which built 26 submarines for the United States Navy during and after World War I. Lake&#x27;s first submarine for the U.S. Navy, , set a depth record of in November 1912.

In 1922 the United States and other countries signed treaties limiting the size of their navies. This led to financial difficulties which forced the Lake Torpedo Boat Company to close in the mid-1920s. Following the company&#x27;s closure, Lake continued designing maritime salvage systems including obtaining permission to partially salvage the Lusitania off the south Irish coast and then later a failed attempt to salvage gold from , a British frigate that sank in 1780 in New York City&#x27;s East River with his submarine, the &quot;Explorer&quot;. Lake redesigned the former as the Arctic exploration submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot;, used by Sir Hubert Wilkins in a 1931 expedition. He also advised the United States Navy on submarine technology and maritime salvage during World War II.
Lake was a member, Freemason of Monmouth Lodge No. 172 in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. He later affiliated with Ansantawae Lodge No. 89 in Milford, Connecticut.

He died on June 23, 1945.

==Legacy==

By his death, Lake had witnessed the submarine&#x27;s arrival as a front-line weapon in the US Navy.

The US Navy built a class of two submarine tenders named in his honor, the
&quot;Simon Lake&quot; class; was in service between 1964 and 1999.

In 1989 Simon Lake was inducted into the Toms River (New Jersey) Schools&#x27; Hall of Fame.

A Milford, Connecticut grammar school named in his honor closed in June 2010. Lake&#x27;s Bay in West Atlantic City, New Jersey is where he tested prototypes.

An Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey street, Simon Lake Drive, at the marina was named in his honor.

<text>Eugene Francis Kranz (born August 17, 1933) is an American aerospace engineer who served as NASA&#x27;s second Chief Flight Director, directing missions of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs, including the first lunar landing mission, Apollo 11. He directed the successful efforts by the Mission Control team to save the crew of Apollo 13, and was portrayed in the 1995 film of the same name by actor Ed Harris. He characteristically wore a close-cut flattop hairstyle and the dapper &quot;mission&quot; vests (waistcoats) of different styles and materials made by his wife, Marta Kranz, for his Flight Director missions.

He coined the phrase &quot;tough and competent&quot;, which became known as the &quot;Kranz Dictum&quot;. Kranz has been the subject of movies, documentary films, and books and periodical articles. Kranz is a recipient of a Presidential Medal of Freedom. In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Kranz was ranked as the second most popular space hero.

==Early years==
Kranz was born August 17, 1933, in Toledo, Ohio, and attended Central Catholic High School. He grew up on a farm that overlooked the Willys-Overland Jeep production plant. His father, Leo Peter Kranz, was the son of German immigrants, and served as an Army medic during World War I. His father died in 1940, when Eugene was only seven years old. Kranz has two older sisters, Louise and Helen. 

Kranz was interested in space at a young age; in high school he wrote a thesis on the topic of a single-stage (SSTO) rocket to the Moon. The thesis was titled &quot;The Design and Possibilities of the Interplanetary Rocket&quot;. Following his high school graduation in 1951, Kranz went to college. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Saint Louis University&#x27;s Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology in 1954. He received his commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, completing pilot training at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas in 1955. Shortly after receiving his wings, Kranz married Marta Cadena, a daughter of Mexican immigrants who fled from Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. Kranz was sent to South Korea to fly the F-86 Sabre aircraft for patrol operations around the Korean DMZ.

After finishing his tour in Korea, Kranz left the Air Force and went to work for McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, where he assisted with the research and testing of new Surface-to-Air (SAM) and Air-to-Ground missiles for the U.S. Air Force at its Research Center at Holloman Air Force Base. He was discharged from the Air Force Reserve as a Captain in 1972.

==NASA career==

After completing the research tests at Holloman Air Force Base, Kranz left McDonnell Aircraft and joined the NASA Space Task Group, then at its Langley Research Center in Virginia. Upon joining NASA, he was assigned, by flight director Christopher C. Kraft, as a Mission Control procedures officer for the uncrewed Mercury-Redstone 1 (MR-1) test (dubbed in Kranz&#x27;s autobiography as the &quot;Four-Inch Flight&quot;, due to its failure to launch).

As Procedures Officer, Kranz was put in charge of integrating Mercury Control with the Launch Control Team at Cape Canaveral, Florida, writing the &quot;Go/NoGo&quot; procedures that allowed missions to continue as planned or be aborted, along with serving as a sort of switchboard operator between the control center at Cape Canaveral and the agency&#x27;s fourteen tracking stations and two tracking ships (via Teletype) located across the globe. Kranz performed this role for all crewed and uncrewed Mercury flights, including the MR-3 and MA-6 flights, which put the first Americans into space and orbit respectively.

After MA-6, he was promoted to Assistant Flight Director for the MA-7 flight of Scott Carpenter in May 1962. MA-7 was his first mission as assistant flight director (AFD); he was under Kraft (the flight director of MA-7). Kranz and Kraft were not the sole reason that MA-7 was saved, as that would be attributed to the whole efforts of Mission Control, but they played a major role.

Kranz continued in this role for the remaining two Mercury flights and the first three Gemini flights. With the upcoming Gemini flights, he was promoted to the Flight Director level and served his first shift, the so-called &quot;operations shift,&quot; for the Gemini 4 mission in 1965, the first U.S. EVA and four-day flight. After Gemini, he served as a Flight Director on odd-numbered Apollo missions, including Apollos 1, 5, 7 and 9, including the first (and only) successful uncrewed test of the Lunar Module (Apollo 5). He was serving as Flight Director for Apollo 11 when the Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot; landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969.

Kranz was chosen to be one of the first flight directors to fly crewed Apollo missions. Kranz worked with the contractor, McDonnell-Douglas on the Mercury and Gemini project, but for Apollo there was a new contractor, Rockwell. Kranz describes Rockwell as new and unfamiliar with the space industry, as they were known for their aeronautical significance at the time. Kranz was assigned as a division chief for Apollo; his tasks included mission preparation, mission design, the writing of the procedures, and the development of the handbooks. Kranz explains that the Apollo program was different from other programs in that time was a major factor. Other missions were allotted ample amount of time: Apollo was not given this luxury. The book by NASA, &quot;What Made Apollo a Success?&quot;, has a section about flight control written by Kranz and James Otis Covington. It gives more detail of the Flight Control Division of the Apollo program.

Kranz explains that the Mission Control logo is an interesting one; he associates it with commitment, teamwork, discipline, morale, tough, competent, risk, and sacrifice.

===Apollo 13===

Kranz is perhaps best known for his role as lead flight director (nicknamed &quot;White Flight&quot;) during NASA&#x27;s Apollo 13 crewed Moon landing mission. Kranz&#x27;s team was on duty when part of the Apollo 13 Service Module exploded and they dealt with the initial hours of the unfolding accident. His &quot;White Team&quot;, dubbed the &quot;Tiger Team&quot; by the press, set the constraints for the consumption of spacecraft consumables (oxygen, electricity, and water) and controlled the three course-correction burns during the trans-Earth trajectory, as well as the power-up procedures that allowed the astronauts to land safely back on Earth in the command module. He and his team were recommended by NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine in communications with Richard Nixon to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their roles.
===Later career===
Kranz continued as a Flight Director through Apollo 17, when he worked his last shift as a flight director overseeing the mission liftoff, and then was promoted to Deputy Director of NASA Mission Operations in 1974, becoming Director in 1983. He was in Mission Control during the January 28, 1986, loss of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; on the STS-51-L launch. He retired from NASA in 1994 after the successful STS-61 flight that repaired the optically flawed Hubble Space Telescope in 1993.

=== After retirement ===
In 2000, Kranz published his autobiography titled &quot;Failure Is Not An Option&quot; (), borrowing from the line used in the 1995 &quot;Apollo 13&quot; film by actor Ed Harris. The History Channel later used it to adapt a documentary about Mission Control in 2004.

Starting in 2017, Kranz helped kickstart and direct the restoration of the Mission Control Room in the Johnson Space Center to the appearance and function of its 1969 use during the Apollo 11 mission. The five million dollar project was intended to be completed for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, and for his efforts Kranz was recognized by Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and October 23, 2018, was declared &quot;Gene Kranz Day&quot;. During the 2018 To the Moon and Beyond luncheon hosted by Space Center Houston, The Gene Kranz Scholarship was started, geared towards funding young students to take part in activities and training for careers in STEM. Ohio State Legislature introduced House Bill 358 to designate August 17 &quot;Gene Kranz Day&quot; in fall of 2019. As of June 2020 the bill has passed the state house and awaits the state senate.

Post-retirement Kranz became a flight engineer on a restored Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, flying at air shows throughout the United States for six years. Kranz continues to give motivational speeches and talks about his experiences with the space programs.

==Personal life==
Kranz, a Catholic, has six children with his wife, Marta: Carmen (born 1958), Lucy (1959), Joan Frances (1961), Mark (1963), Brigid (1964), and Jean Marie (1966). In a NASA article, &quot;Lessons from My Father&quot;, Kranz’s youngest daughter Jeannie mentioned that her dad was a very “engaged” father and likened him to the character Ward Cleaver in the television show &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Kranz has appeared as a character in several dramatizations of the Apollo program. The first portrayal was in the 1974 TV movie &quot;Houston, We&#x27;ve Got a Problem&quot;, where he is played by Ed Nelson. He is played by Ed Harris in the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, who received an Oscar nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Matt Frewer portrays him in the 1996 TV movie &quot;Apollo 11&quot;. He is portrayed by Dan Butler in the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. In a 2016 episode of the NBC series &quot;Timeless&quot; titled &quot;Space Race&quot;, he is portrayed by John Brotherton. In the 2019 Apple TV+ series &quot;For All Mankind&quot; he is played by Eric Ladin and given the alternate history context of the series, his character is depicted with elements that are partially fictional.

In the videogame &quot;Kerbal Space Program&quot;, the character for Mission Control is named &quot;Gene Kerman&quot;, referencing Kranz and wearing a vest reminiscent of his signature apparel.

Kranz has also been featured in several documentaries using NASA film archives, including the 2004 History Channel production &quot;Failure Is Not an Option&quot; and its 2005 follow-up &quot;Beyond the Moon: Failure Is Not an Option 2&quot;, recurring History Channel broadcasts based on the 1979 book &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, the 2008 Discovery Channel production &quot;When We Left Earth&quot;, and the 2017 David Fairhead documentary &quot;Mission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo&quot;.

Archive audio clips including Kranz&#x27;s name and voice are included in the track &quot;Go!&quot; on the 2015 Public Service Broadcasting album &quot;The Race for Space&quot;, a track inspired by the Apollo 11 Moon landing.

The Eugene Kranz Junior High School, located in Dickinson, Texas, is named after him.

In 2020, Toledo Express Airport was renamed officially to the Eugene F. Kranz Toledo Express Airport.

==&quot;Failure is not an option&quot;==
Kranz has become associated with the phrase &quot;failure is not an option.&quot; It was uttered by actor Ed Harris, playing Kranz, in the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. Kranz then used it as the title of his 2000 autobiography. Later it became the title of a 2004 television documentary about NASA, as well as of that documentary&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Beyond the Moon: Failure Is Not an Option 2.&quot; Kranz travels all over the world giving a motivational lecture titled &quot;Failure Is Not an Option,&quot; including the historic Apollo 13 flight control room.

&quot;Failure is not an option&quot; was in fact coined by Bill Broyles, one of the screenwriters of &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, based on a similar statement made not by Kranz, but another member of the Apollo 13 mission control crew, FDO Flight Controller Jerry Bostick. According to Bostick:
==Teams, &quot;the human factor&quot; and &quot;the right stuff&quot;==

Each Flight Director took a different color as a designator; the first three Flight Directors chose red, white, and blue, and each was identified as &quot;_____ Flight&quot; (a tradition that continues to this day). Thus, Kranz was White Flight and was the leader of the &quot;White Team&quot;, one of the flight control teams whose shift at Mission Control contributed to saving the Apollo 13 astronauts. Though Apollo 13 did not achieve its main objective, to Kranz its astronauts&#x27; rescue is an example of the &quot;human factor&quot; born out of the 1960s space race. According to Kranz, this factor is what is largely responsible for helping put the United States on the Moon in only a decade. The blend of young intelligent minds working day in and day out by sheer willpower yielded &quot;the right stuff.&quot;

Kranz had this to say about the &quot;human factor&quot;:

According to him, a few organized examples of this factor included Grumman, who developed the Apollo Lunar Module, North American Aviation, and the Lockheed Corporation. After the excitement of the 1960s, these companies dissolved in corporate mergers, such as happened when Lockheed became Lockheed Martin. Another example of the &quot;human factor&quot; was the ingenuity and hard work by teams that developed the emergency plans and sequences as new problems arose during the Apollo 13 mission.

==&quot;The Kranz Dictum&quot;==
Kranz called a meeting of his branch and flight control team on the Monday morning following the Apollo 1 disaster that killed Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. Kranz made the following address to the gathering (The Kranz Dictum), in which his expression of values and admonishments for future spaceflight are his legacy to NASA:
After the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; accident in 2003, NASA Administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe quoted this speech in a discussion about what changes should be made in response to the disaster. Referring to the words &quot;tough and competent,&quot; he said, &quot;These words are the price of admission to the ranks of NASA and we should adopt it that way.&quot;

==Views on the space program after the Moon landing==

Kranz said that much of the &quot;human factor&quot; dried up after the Moon landings, particularly because the United States viewed the Moon landings as a short-term goal to beat the Soviet Union – and not much more. When asked in spring 2000 if NASA is still the same place today as it was in the years of the space race, he replied:


In his book &quot;Failure Is Not an Option,&quot; he also expressed disappointment that support for space exploration dried up after the Apollo program. Writing about his vision for renewing the space program he said:

<text>John Thomas (1 March 1826 – 19 March 1913) was a Welsh composer and harpist. The bardic name Pencerdd Gwalia (Chief of the Welsh minstrels) was conferred on him at the 1861 Aberdare Eisteddfod.

==Life==
He was born in Bridgend on Saint David&#x27;s Day, son of a tailor, also named John Thomas, a clarinetist in the amateur town band. He was the eldest of seven children, four of whom also played the harp, most notably his brother Thomas Thomas. John Thomas started off by playing the triple harp, which had three sets of strings and was very difficult to play. At the age of 14, through the influence of Ada Lovelace, (Lord Byron&#x27;s daughter), he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Music in London. His teachers there included Cipriani Potter for composition and John Balsir Chatterton for harp.

He taught at the Royal College of Music, where he eventually became professor, and at the Guildhall School of Music. One of his pupils at the Royal College was Gwendolen Mason.

He wrote many pieces for the harp that are popular today and are used in the exam syllabus. He also wrote an opera, a symphony, two harp concertos, overtures, chamber music, and two cantatas – &quot;Llewellyn&quot; (1863) and &quot;The Bride of Neath Valley&quot; (1866). He played one of his own harp concertos at a Philharmonic concert in 1852.

In 1861, he was briefly engaged to the Belgian soprano Désirée Artôt. He eventually married twice, both times to former students. His first wife, Alice Ann Keate, died in 1880, two years after their marriage; he married Joan Francis Denny in 1885.

In 1872, he was appointed harpist to Queen Victoria.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is the national anthem of Azerbaijan. The music was composed by Uzeyir Hajibeyov, and the lyrics were written by poet Ahmad Javad or cultural figure and politician Jamo bey Hajinski. The government officially adopted the anthem in 1920, with the passage of the decree, &quot;On the State Hymn of the Republic of Azerbaijan&quot;. In 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan&#x27;s government officially restored &quot;&quot; as the national anthem.

The Azerbaijan government has also officially declared the national anthem to be &quot;the sacred symbol of the Azerbaijan state, its independence and unity.&quot;

Since 2006, a fragment of the lyrics is depicted on the obverse of the 5 manat banknote. In 2011, to mark the 20th anniversary of independence, a stamp featuring the lyrics was issued.

==History==

In 1919, during the formation of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the new government announced it was accepting submissions from the public for a national anthem, coat of arms and state seal. A prize of 15,000 rubles would be awarded to the citizen who submitted the winning anthem.

Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov wrote two marches. In 1919, this work received the first award announced by the government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The second march was the &quot;March of Azerbaijan.&quot; According to Turkish musicologist Etem Üngör, &quot;In those years, when Azerbaijan had not yet lost its independence, the march was chanted by military schools before lessons.&quot;

In 1922, the &quot;&quot; was replaced by the Soviet communist anthem &quot;The Internationale&quot;. In 1944, during World War II, the new Soviet national anthem replaced &quot;The Internationale&quot; and an additional anthem of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was installed.

In 1989, following several years of changes brought by &quot;perestroika&quot;, composer Aydin Azimov arranged a modern recording of the anthem by a full symphony and chorus. That fall, &quot;&quot; was broadcast on television and radios in Azerbaijan, 70 years after it was introduced.
===Post-Soviet restoration===
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in spring 1992, the leaders of the independent Azerbaijani government proposed that the original anthem should be restored as the anthem of Azerbaijan. The Milli Mejlis (National Assembly) signed it into law on 27 May 1992.
==Lyrics==
=== Current official ===

The anthem is usually performed in A, D, and G minor.

=== In other scripts ===

==Regulations==
Regulations for the performance of the national anthem are set forth in the law signed by President Heydar Aliyev in 1996. While a performance of the anthem may include only music, only words, or a combination of both, the anthem must be performed using the official music and words prescribed by law. Once a performance has been recorded, it may be used for any purpose, such as in a radio or television broadcast.

==Musical adaptations==
In 2012, Philip Sheppard with the London Philharmonic Orchestra recorded the anthem for the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

<text>John Thomas (1724 – 2 June 1776) was an American medical doctor and soldier from Massachusetts who became a major general in the Continental Army. He was a leader during the siege of Boston. Thomas briefly commanded the withdrawal from Canada after the unsuccessful invasion by the Continental Army. He died from smallpox during the retreat.

==Early life==

Thomas was born in Marshfield, Province of Massachusetts Bay. As a young man he studied medicine with Doctor Tufts in Medford before beginning his own practice in Kingston. He was married to Hannah Thomas with whom he had two sons and a daughter.

==Colonial wars==
During King George&#x27;s War in 1746 he was appointed surgeon to a regiment bound for Annapolis Royal in Nova Scotia. Liking military service, in 1747 he traded his post as surgeon for that of a lieutenant. In 1755 he served as surgeon in General William Shirley&#x27;s regiment.

By the time of the French and Indian War he had risen to colonel in the militia or provincial ranks. He served in Nova Scotia again in 1759. In 1760, General Jeffery Amherst put him at the head of a division during the attack and capture of Montreal. After the war he returned to his practice at Kingston. He was married to Hannah Thomas with whom he had a daughter and two sons.

==American War of Independence==
In the period leading up to open war, Thomas recruited a regiment of volunteers (2nd Massachusetts Regiment) in Plymouth County and served as their colonel. In February 1775 the state assembly named him a brigadier general. He led his troops to the siege in Boston, and in June, the Congress appointed him a brigadier in the Continental Army.

Thomas briefly resigned, disappointed that while four major generals were named, he was not on the list. Congress was then trying to name no more than one major general from each state, and Artemas Ward was given preference. When George Washington and Charles Lee both implored him to remain, he returned to service. The Congress resolved that he would be given precedence over all other brigadiers in the army.

On the night of March 4, 1776, he led his division to fortify the Dorchester Heights, overlooking the south harbor at Boston, by using cannon that Henry Knox had brought from Fort Ticonderoga. From that position, he threatened the British fleet and the British were forced to withdraw, evacuating Boston on March 17. Thomas was finally named a major general.

After General Richard Montgomery was killed, Thomas was assigned to command in Canada and take charge of the Canadian invasion. He joined the army besieging Quebec on May 1, but found a disaster. The forces here numbered less than 1,000. Besides its walls, the city had more defenders than that. Over 300 of his men were already overdue for discharge from their enlistment, and smallpox was raging through the force.

He immediately sent the sick men to Trois-Rivières and began a withdrawal with the rest. Thomas died of smallpox on June 2, 1776, during the retreat up the Richelieu River near Chambly. By June 18, the Continental Army had abandoned Canada.

<text>Karl Kraus (28 April 1874 – 12 June 1936) was an Austrian writer and journalist, known as a satirist, essayist, aphorist, playwright and poet. He directed his satire at the press, German culture, and German and Austrian politics. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kraus was born into the wealthy Jewish family of Jacob Kraus, a papermaker, and his wife Ernestine, née Kantor, in Jičín, Kingdom of Bohemia, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic). The family moved to Vienna in 1877. His mother died in 1891.

Kraus enrolled as a law student at the University of Vienna in 1892. Beginning in April of the same year, he began contributing to the paper , starting with a critique of Gerhart Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;The Weavers&quot;. Around that time, he unsuccessfully tried to perform as an actor in a small theater. In 1894, he changed his field of studies to philosophy and German literature. He discontinued his studies in 1896. His friendship with Peter Altenberg began about this time.

===Career===

====Before 1900====

In 1896, Kraus left university without a diploma to begin work as an actor, stage director and performer, joining the Young Vienna group, which included Peter Altenberg, Leopold Andrian, Hermann Bahr, Richard Beer-Hofmann, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Felix Salten. In 1897, Kraus broke from this group with a biting satire, (&quot;Demolished Literature&quot;), and was named Vienna correspondent for the newspaper &quot;Breslauer Zeitung&quot;. One year later, as an uncompromising advocate of Jewish assimilation, he attacked the founder of modern Zionism, Theodor Herzl, with his polemic (1898) (&quot;A Crown for Zion&quot;). The title is a play on words, in that &quot;Krone&quot; means both &quot;crown&quot; and the currency of Austria-Hungary from 1892 to 1918; one &quot;Krone&quot; was the minimum donation required to participate in the Zionist Congress in Basel, and Herzl was often mocked as the &quot;king of Zion&quot; (&quot;König von Zion&quot;) by Viennese anti-Zionists.

On 1 April 1899, Kraus renounced Judaism, and in the same year he founded his own magazine, &quot;Die Fackel&quot; (German: &quot;The Torch&quot;), which he continued to direct, publish, and write until his death, and from which he launched his attacks on hypocrisy, psychoanalysis, corruption of the Habsburg empire, nationalism of the pan-German movement, laissez-faire economic policies, and numerous other subjects.

====1900–1909====
In 1901 Kraus was sued by Hermann Bahr and Emmerich Bukovics, who felt they had been attacked in &quot;Die Fackel&quot;. Many lawsuits by various offended parties followed in later years. Also in 1901, Kraus found out that his publisher, Moriz Frisch, had taken over his magazine while he was absent on a months-long journey. Frisch had registered the magazine&#x27;s front cover as a trademark and published the &quot;Neue Fackel&quot; (&quot;New Torch&quot;). Kraus sued and won. From that time, &quot;Die Fackel&quot; was published (without a cover page) by the printer Jahoda &amp; Siegel.

While &quot;Die Fackel&quot; at first resembled journals like &quot;Die Weltbühne&quot;, it increasingly became a magazine that was privileged in its editorial independence, thanks to Kraus&#x27;s financial independence. &quot;Die Fackel&quot; printed what Kraus wanted to be printed. In its first decade, contributors included such well-known writers and artists as Peter Altenberg, Richard Dehmel, Egon Friedell, Oskar Kokoschka, Else Lasker-Schüler, Adolf Loos, Heinrich Mann, Arnold Schoenberg, August Strindberg, Georg Trakl, Frank Wedekind, Franz Werfel, Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Oscar Wilde. After 1911, however, Kraus was usually the sole author. Kraus&#x27;s work was published nearly exclusively in &quot;Die Fackel&quot;, of which 922 irregularly issued numbers appeared in total. Authors who were supported by Kraus include Peter Altenberg, Else Lasker-Schüler, and Georg Trakl.

&quot;Die Fackel&quot; targeted corruption, journalists and brutish behaviour. Notable enemies were Maximilian Harden (in the mud of the Harden–Eulenburg affair), Moriz Benedikt (owner of the newspaper &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;), Alfred Kerr, Hermann Bahr, and Johann Schober.

In 1902, Kraus published &quot;Sittlichkeit und Kriminalität&quot; (&quot;Morality and Criminal Justice&quot;), for the first time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations: he attacked the general opinion of the time that it was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice (&quot;Der Skandal fängt an, wenn die Polizei ihm ein Ende macht&quot;, &quot;The Scandal Starts When the Police Ends It&quot;). Starting in 1906, Kraus published the first of his aphorisms in &quot;Die Fackel&quot;; they were collected in 1909 in the book &quot;Sprüche und Widersprüche&quot; (&quot;Sayings and Gainsayings&quot;).

In addition to his writings, Kraus gave numerous highly influential public readings during his career, put on approximately 700 one-man performances between 1892 and 1936 in which he read from the dramas of Bertolt Brecht, Gerhart Hauptmann, Johann Nestroy, Goethe, and Shakespeare, and also performed Offenbach&#x27;s operettas, accompanied by piano and singing all the roles himself. Elias Canetti, who regularly attended Kraus&#x27;s lectures, titled the second volume of his autobiography &quot;&quot;Die Fackel&quot; im Ohr&quot; (&quot;&quot;The Torch&quot; in the Ear&quot;) in reference to the magazine and its author. At the peak of his popularity, Kraus&#x27;s lectures attracted four thousand people, and his magazine sold forty thousand copies.

In 1904, Kraus supported Frank Wedekind to make possible the staging in Vienna of his controversial play &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;; the play told the story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in German society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution. These plays&#x27; frank depiction of sexuality and violence, including lesbianism and an encounter with Jack the Ripper, pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time. Wedekind&#x27;s works are considered among the precursors of expressionism, but in 1914, when expressionist poets like Richard Dehmel began producing war propaganda, Kraus became a fierce critic of them.

In 1907, Kraus attacked his erstwhile benefactor Maximilian Harden because of his role in the Eulenburg trial in the first of his spectacular &quot;Erledigungen&quot; (&quot;Dispatches&quot;).

====1910–1919====
After 1911, Kraus was the sole author of most issues of &quot;Die Fackel&quot;.

One of Kraus&#x27;s most influential satirical-literary techniques was his clever wordplay with quotations. One controversy arose with the text &quot;Die Orgie&quot;, which exposed how the newspaper &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; was blatantly supporting Austria&#x27;s Liberal Party&#x27;s election campaign; the text was conceived as a guerrilla prank and sent as a fake letter to the newspaper (&quot;Die Fackel&quot; would publish it later in 1911); the enraged editor, who fell for the trick, responded by suing Kraus for &quot;disturbing the serious business of politicians and editors&quot;.

After an obituary for Franz Ferdinand, who had been assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, &quot;Die Fackel&quot; was not published for many months. In December 1914, it appeared again with an essay &quot;In dieser großen Zeit&quot; (&quot;In this grand time&quot;): &quot;In dieser großen Zeit, die ich noch gekannt habe, wie sie so klein war; die wieder klein werden wird, wenn ihr dazu noch Zeit bleibt; … in dieser lauten Zeit, die da dröhnt von der schauerlichen Symphonie der Taten, die Berichte hervorbringen, und der Berichte, welche Taten verschulden: in dieser da mögen Sie von mir kein eigenes Wort erwarten.&quot; (&quot;In this grand time, which I used to know when it was this small; which will become small again if there is time; … in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports, and of reports that cause deeds: in this one, you may not expect a word of my own.&quot;) In the subsequent time, Kraus wrote against the World War, and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of &quot;Die Fackel&quot;.

Kraus&#x27;s masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the First World War, &quot;Die letzten Tage der Menschheit&quot; (&quot;The Last Days of Mankind&quot;), which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with apocalyptic fantasy and commentary by two characters called &quot;the Grumbler&quot; and &quot;the Optimist&quot;. Kraus began to write the play in 1915 and first published it as a series of special &quot;Fackel&quot; issues in 1919. Its epilogue, &quot;Die letzte Nacht&quot; (&quot;The last night&quot;) had already been published in 1918 as a special issue.
Edward Timms has called the work a &quot;faulted masterpiece&quot; and a &quot;fissured text&quot; because the evolution of Kraus&#x27;s attitude during the time of its composition (from aristocratic conservative to democratic republican) gave the text structural inconsistencies resembling a geological fault.

Also in 1919, Kraus published his collected war texts under the title &quot;Weltgericht&quot; (&quot;World Court of Justice&quot;). In 1920, he published the satire &quot;Literatur oder man wird doch da sehn&quot; (&quot;Literature, or You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot;) as a reply to Franz Werfel&#x27;s &quot;Spiegelmensch&quot; (&quot;Mirror Man&quot;), an attack against Kraus.
====1920–1936====
During January 1924, Kraus started a fight against Imre Békessy, publisher of the tabloid &quot;Die Stunde&quot; (&quot;The Hour&quot;), accusing him of extorting money from restaurant owners by threatening them with bad reviews unless they paid him. Békessy retaliated with a libel campaign against Kraus, who in turn launched an &quot;Erledigung&quot; with the catchphrase &quot;Hinaus aus Wien mit dem Schuft!&quot; (&quot;Throw the scoundrel out of Vienna!&quot;). In 1926, Békessy indeed fled Vienna to avoid arrest. Békessy achieved some later success when his novel &quot;Barabbas&quot; was the monthly selection of an American book club.

A peak in Kraus&#x27;s political commitment was his sensational attack in 1927 on the powerful Vienna police chief Johann Schober, also a former two-term chancellor, after 89 rioters were shot dead by the police during the 1927 July Revolt. Kraus produced a poster that in a single sentence requested Schober&#x27;s resignation; the poster was published all over Vienna and is considered an icon of 20th-century Austrian history.

In 1928, the play &quot;Die Unüberwindlichen&quot; (&quot;The Insurmountables&quot;) was published. It included allusions to the fights against Békessy and Schober. During that same year, Kraus also published the records of a lawsuit Kerr had filed against him after Kraus had published Kerr&#x27;s war poems in &quot;Die Fackel&quot; (Kerr, having become a pacifist, did not want his earlier enthusiasm for the war exposed). In 1932, Kraus translated Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets.

Kraus supported the Social Democratic Party of Austria from at least the early 1920s, but in 1934, hoping Engelbert Dollfuss could prevent Nazism from engulfing Austria, he supported Dollfuss&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état, which established the Austrian fascist regime. This support estranged Kraus from some of his followers.

In 1933 Kraus wrote &quot;Die Dritte Walpurgisnacht&quot; (&quot;The Third Walpurgis Night&quot;), of which the first fragments appeared in &quot;Die Fackel&quot;. Kraus withheld full publication in part to protect his friends and followers hostile to Hitler who still lived in the Third Reich from Nazi reprisals, and in part because &quot;violence is no subject for polemic.&quot; This satire on Nazi ideology begins with the now-famous sentence, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Hitler brings nothing to my mind&quot;). Lengthy extracts appear in Kraus&#x27;s apologia for his silence at Hitler&#x27;s coming to power, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Why &quot;Die Fackel&quot; is not published&quot;), a 315-page edition of the periodical. The last issue of &quot;Die Fackel&quot; appeared in February 1936. Shortly after, he fell in a collision with a bicyclist and suffered intense headaches and loss of memory. He gave his last lecture in April, and had a severe heart attack in the Café Imperial on 10 June. He died in his apartment in Vienna on 12 June 1936, and was buried in the Zentralfriedhof cemetery in Vienna.

Kraus never married, but from 1913 until his death he had a conflict-prone but close relationship with the Baroness Sidonie Nádherná von Borutín (1885–1950). Many of his works were written in Janowitz castle, Nádherný family property. Sidonie Nádherná became an important pen pal to Kraus and addressee of his books and poems.

In 1911 Kraus was baptized as a Catholic, but in 1923, disillusioned by the Church&#x27;s support for the war, he left the Catholic Church, claiming sarcastically that he was motivated &quot;primarily by antisemitism&quot;, i.e. indignation at Max Reinhardt&#x27;s use of the Kollegienkirche in Salzburg as the venue for a theatrical performance.

Kraus was the subject of two books by Thomas Szasz, &quot;Karl Kraus and the Soul Doctors&quot; and &quot;Anti-Freud: Karl Kraus&#x27;s Criticism of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry&quot;, which portray Kraus as a harsh critic of Sigmund Freud and of psychoanalysis in general. Other commentators, such as Edward Timms, have argued that Kraus respected Freud, though with reservations about the application of some of his theories, and that his views were far less black-and-white than Szasz suggests.

== Character ==
Karl Kraus was a subject of controversy throughout his lifetime. Marcel Reich-Ranicki called him &#x27;vain, self-righteous and self-important&#x27;. Kraus&#x27;s followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do anything to help those he supported. Kraus considered posterity his ultimate audience, and reprinted &quot;Die Fackel&quot; in volume form years after it was first published.

A concern with language was central to Kraus&#x27;s outlook, and he viewed his contemporaries&#x27; careless use of language as symptomatic of their insouciant treatment of the world. Viennese composer Ernst Krenek described meeting the writer in 1932: &quot;At a time when people were generally decrying the Japanese bombardment of Shanghai, I met Karl Kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems. He said something like: &#x27;I know that everything is futile when the house is burning. But I have to do this, as long as it is at all possible; for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place, Shanghai would not be burning&#x27;.&quot;

The Austrian author Stefan Zweig once called Kraus &quot;the master of venomous ridicule&quot; (&quot;der Meister des giftigen Spotts&quot;). Up to 1930, Kraus directed his satirical writings to figures of the center and the left of the political spectrum, as he considered the flaws of the right too self-evident to be worthy of his comment. Later, his responses to the Nazis included &quot;The Third Walpurgis Night&quot;.

To the numerous enemies he made with the inflexibility and intensity of his partisanship, however, he was a bitter misanthrope and &quot;poor would-be&quot; (Alfred Kerr). He was accused of wallowing in hateful denunciations and &quot;Erledigungen&quot; [breakings-off]. Along with Karl Valentin, he is considered a master of gallows humor.

Giorgio Agamben compared Guy Debord and Kraus for their criticism of journalists and media culture.

Gregor von Rezzori wrote of Kraus, &quot;[His] life stands as an example of moral uprightness and courage which should be put before anyone who writes, in no matter what language... I had the privilege of listening to his conversation and watching his face, lit up by the pale fire of his fanatic love for the miracle of the German language and by his holy hatred for those who used it badly.&quot;

Kraus&#x27;s work has been described as the culmination of a literary outlook. Critic Frank Field quoted the words Bertolt Brecht wrote of Kraus, on hearing of his death: &quot;As the epoch raised its hand to end its own life, he was the hand.&quot;

<text>Michelle Bauer (born October 1, 1958) is an American actress, model, and B movie scream queen.

==Early life==
Bauer was born and raised in Simi Valley, California. She is of Mexican heritage on her mother&#x27;s side and Czechoslovakian heritage on her father&#x27;s side.

==Career==
Bauer was &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine&#x27;s Pet of the Month for July 1981 and also appeared in many other adult magazines during the early to mid 1980s, under a number of different names.

Bauer starred in the pornographic film &quot;Café Flesh&quot; (1982) under the name of Pia Snow. She states that she was happy to appear in the film and on the covers of other films with an X rating, but insisted on a double for the sex scenes. Bauer appeared in several other pornographic titles under her Pia Snow moniker, including &quot;Bad Girls&quot; (1981), &quot;Nightdreams&quot; (1981), and others.

Bauer&#x27;s &quot;Penthouse&quot; centerfold appearance led to acting for the Playboy Channel and a film try-out for director Fred Olen Ray. Ray liked her audition, and offered her the part if she would be willing to dye her hair black. Her first B movie was &quot;The Tomb&quot; (1986), it would be the first of many. Along with Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens, Bauer became one of the most prominent B movie scream queens in the late 1980s. In addition to multiple films for Ray, she has worked with cult directors David DeCoteau, Jesús Franco and Zalman King and shared the screen with genre stars such as Sybil Danning, Monique Gabrielle, Julie Strain, Lina Romay, George Kennedy, David Carradine, Gunnar Hansen, Paul Naschy and Erik Estrada.

Her life and career are one of the main subjects of the 2011 documentary &quot;Screaming in High Heels: The Rise and Fall of the Scream Queen Era&quot; by director Jason Paul Collum. She returned for the 2020 follow-up &quot;Screaming in High Heels: The Reunion&quot; which again reunited her with Quigley and Stevens.

==Personal life==
Bauer retained her married name as a screen name. After she and her husband divorced, he filed a lawsuit requesting she not use it for her films. She tried appearing as Michelle McClellan, using the name of her second husband, in &quot;Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers&quot; (1988), but the press resisted, so she returned to Bauer, which the first husband eventually accepted.

<text>Adamantios Korais or Koraïs ( ; ; ; 27 April 17486 April 1833) was a Greek scholar credited with laying the foundations of modern Greek literature and a major figure in the Greek Enlightenment. His activities paved the way for the Greek War of Independence and the emergence of a purified form of the Greek language, known as Katharevousa. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; asserts that &quot;his influence on the modern Greek language and culture has been compared to that of Dante on Italian and Martin Luther on German&quot;.

==Life and views==

Korais was born in Smyrna, in 1748. His father Ioannis, of Chian descent, was &quot;demogérontas&quot; in Smyrna; a seat similar to the prokritoi of mainland Greece, but elected by the Greek community of the town and not imposed by the Ottomans.
He was exceptionally passionate about philosophy, literacy and linguistics and studied greatly throughout his youth. He initially studied in his hometown, Smyrna, where he graduated from the Evangelical Greek School.

After his school years, he lived for a while in Amsterdam as a merchant, but soon he decided that he wanted to study in a university. He studied also the Hebrew, Dutch, French and English languages, apart from his knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin.

Korais studied at the school of medicine of the University of Montpellier from 1782 to 1787. His 1786 diploma thesis was entitled &quot;Pyretologiae Synopsis&quot;, while his 1787 doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;Medicus Hippocraticus&quot;.

He traveled to Paris where he would continue his enthusiasm for knowledge. There he decided to translate ancient Greek authors and produced thirty volumes of those translations, being one of the first modern Greek philologists and publishers of ancient Greek literature.

After 1788 he was to spend most of his life as an expatriate in Paris. As classical scholar, Korais was repelled by the Byzantine influence on Greek society and was a fierce critic of the lack of education amongst the clergy and their subservience to the Ottoman Empire, although he conceded it was the Orthodox Church that preserved the national identity of Greeks.

Korais believed Western Europe was the heir of the ancient Greek civilization, which had to be transmitted to the modern Greeks through education. Additionally, he advocated the restoration and use of the term &quot;Hellene&quot; (Έλληνας) or &quot;Graikos&quot; (Γραικός) as an ethnonym for the Greeks, in the place of &quot;Romiós&quot;, that was seen negatively by him.

While in Paris, he was witness to the French Revolution. He was influenced by the revolutionary and liberal sentiments of his age. He admired Thomas Jefferson; and exchanged political and philosophical thoughts with the American statesman. A typical man of the Enlightenment, Korais encouraged wealthy Greeks to open new libraries and schools throughout Greece. Korais believed that education would ensure not only the achievement of independence but also the establishment of a proper constitution for the new liberated Greek state. He envisioned a democratic Greece, recapturing the glory of the Golden Age of Pericles.

Korais died in Paris aged 84 soon after publishing the first volume of his autobiography. In 1877, his remains were sent to Greece, to be buried there.

==Publications==
Korais&#x27;s most lasting contributions were literary. Those who were instrumental in publishing, and presenting his work to the public were merchants from Chios. He felt eternally grateful to these merchants, since without them, it would have been financially impossible for him to publish his works. These works included Strabo in Greek, another on Marcus Aurelius, his translation of Herodotus, the translation of the Iliad, and his main literary work, the seventeen volumes of the &quot;Library of Greek Literature&quot;.

His political writing begins with the publication at the opening of the nineteenth century of &quot;Asma Polemistirion&quot; (&quot;War Chant&quot;) and &quot;Salpisma Polemistirion&quot; (&quot;Military Bugal Call&quot;), celebrating the presence of Greek troops fighting alongside the French in Egypt. Earlier he had confronted with his &quot;Adelphiki Didaskalia&quot; the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem for urging the Sultan&#x27;s Christian subjects (with the religious brochure &quot;Patriki Didaskalia&quot;) to support the Ottomans in the war against the &quot;atheistic&quot; French. On contrary, he made a call to the Greeks to fight beside the French, &quot;who have the military virtue of the ancient Greeks&quot;, against the Ottoman tyranny.

Korais went on to publish in 1803 his &quot;Report on the Present State of Civilization in Greece&quot;, based on a series of lectures he had given in Paris, extolling the link between the rise of a new Greek mercantile class and the advance of the Modern Greek Enlightenment. In &quot;What should we Greeks do in the Present Circumstances?&quot;, a work of 1805, he tried to win his compatriots over to Napoleon and away from the cause of their Russian co-religionists. In later years, though, his enthusiasm for the French Emperor diminished, and he ended by referring to him as the &#x27;tyrant of tyrants.&#x27;

Away from contemporary politics, Korais did much to revive the idea of Greece with the creation of the Hellenic Library, devoted to new editions of some of the classic texts, starting with Homer in 1805. Over the following twenty years many others appeared, with lengthy prefaces by Korais entitled &#x27;Impromptu Reflections&#x27;, with his views on political, educational and linguistic matters. Although the broad mass of the Greek people was beyond his reach, he played an important part in the shaping of a new consciousness among the intelligentsia, which was to play a part in the creation of a new national movement.

With the breakout of the Greek Revolution in 1821, he was too old to join the struggle. However his house in Paris became a centre for informations, meetings among the Parisian Greeks and financial aid. He wrote also many letters advising the revolutionaries. Initially a supporter of Kapodistrias, finally he opposed his policies.

==On religion==
Korais was a Greek Orthodox but also a critic of many practices of the Orthodox church. He was a fierce critic of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, considering it a useful tool in the hands of the Ottomans against the Greek independence. So, later, he was one of the supporters of the new established Church of Greece.

He was also critic of the monasticism, the lack of education in the clergy, and practices like that of the &quot;Holy Fire&quot;. He was a supporter of religious freedom, empiricism, rationalism and tolerance. He set himself in opposition to some metaphysical ideals of Greek custom and sought to mould Greek Orthodoxy towards a more syncretic religious basis, in order to bring it under the auspices of liberal thought and government.

==On Greek language==
One of his most significant accomplishments was his contribution to the standardisation of the modern Greek language. During his lifetime, the Greeks were widely dispersed around the Mediterranean and throughout Europe, and the language they spoke contained many foreign elements, depending on the region and local traditions. Korais proposed a standard language purged of many such foreign elements (especially Turkish, but also Western words and phrases). Moreover, there was a variety of idioms spoken by Greeks in everyday life and no common agreement on which dialect should serve as the basis for Standard Modern Greek. Finally, people involved in the Greek language question were also divided between &quot;archaists&quot; and proponents of a simpler standard language.

Korais&#x27;s solution was to take a middle path regarding all these issues. He cleansed his proposed standard language from elements that he considered too foreign or too vulgar. Moreover, he proposed the creation of a &quot;katharevousa&quot; (a &quot;purified&quot; version of modern Greek), based on the ecclesiastical language used by the Greek Orthodox Church, close to the Koine Greek. This standard was eventually adopted by scholars and the Greek state.

==Influence on the Greek constitutional and legal system==

Unknown to most, Korais held passionate views on how the legal system should function in a democracy (views which of course, were greatly influenced by the French Enlightenment, closer to Montesquieu than to Rousseau) and managed to have a great, albeit indirect, impact on the Constitutions of the Greek Revolution, but also, primarily, on the Constitution or Syntagma created after the end of the Greek Revolution. This element holds significant importance if one takes into consideration the fact that these meta-Revolution Constitutions still, to the present day, form the basis of the Greek Constitution and the philosophy on which the guiding principles of the Greek legal and judicial system are rooted in.

This influence Korais exercised on Greek Law, was due to a personal relationship the intellectual formed with another Greek intellectual, the legal scholar of international repute N. I. Saripolos, who, after the Greek Revolution, became the founding father of Greek Law and the &quot;author&quot; of the Greek Constitution. Proof of this relationship and of the strong and progressive views Korais held on how the legal system of the new Greek state should be formed, is based on correspondence exchanged between the two men, during a long period of time, beginning before the Greek Revolution. These letters which manifest the influence the older intellectual (Korais) had on the then aspiring lawmaker Saripolos, are in the possession of the archives of the Greek National Library, were discovered and brought to academic light, in 1996, by a Law School student, researching a project sponsored by the Faculty of Law of the University of Athens and the National Academy for Constitutional Research and Public Law (adjacent to the University of Athens). The ensuing thesis was published.

==Legacy==
Korais was declared &quot;Pater Patriae&quot; (&quot;Pateras tis Patridos&quot;) by the revolutionaries at the Third National Assembly at Troezen. Korais&#x27; portrait was depicted on the reverse of the Greek ₯100 banknote of 1978–2001. Many streets all over Greece are named after him, while his archive can be found in Korais Library in Chios (town). &quot;Korais&quot; is also the name of a vessel of Zante Ferries.

<text>Mark Shainblum (born 1963 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian writer who now lives in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Though he has worked as a journalist and editor, Shainblum is best known as a science fiction and comic book writer.

==Early life==

In the early 1980s, Shainblum published two issues of a comics and science fiction fanzine called &quot;Orion: The Canadian Magazine of Time and Space&quot;, and later founded Matrix Graphic Series (later known as Matrix Comics), one of only a handful of independent comic book publishers in Canada at the time.

==Career==
His published works include:

*&quot;Northguard&quot;, a post-modern Canadian superhero, created in the 1980s with illustrator Gabriel Morrissette. Though Northguard was published as an independent comic book series and didn&#x27;t achieve the notoriety of better-known Canadian superheroes like Richard Comely&#x27;s &quot;Captain Canuck&quot; or Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, it was well received by critics and a core following of fans. The Quebec superheroine Fleur-de-Lys, a supporting character from the series, even made her way to a Canadian postage stamp in 1995.
*&quot;Angloman&quot;, co-created with Gabriel Morrissette. A humorous parody of politics in Shainblum&#x27;s native province of Quebec, Angloman was first published in book form and then made the leap to two Montreal newspapers, the alternative newsweekly &quot;Montreal Mirror&quot; and the mass-circulation daily &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;.

With John Dupuis, Shainblum afor lso co-edited the 1998 short story collection &quot;Arrowdreams: An Anthology of Alternate Canadas&quot;, which garnered a Prix Aurora Award for Canadian science fiction in 1999. Shainblum was also a finalist in the 2001 international Mark Twain Writing Competition and recently published a story in Claude Lalumière&#x27;s anthology &quot;Island Dreams: Montreal Writers of the Fantastic&quot; from Véhicule Press. In 2002–03, he served as president of SF Canada, Canada&#x27;s national association of science fiction and fantasy authors. In 2017, he was nominated for the 2017 Aurora Awards for &quot;Best Related Work&quot; for &quot;Superhero Universe: Tesseracts Nineteen.&quot; He co-authored this book with Claude Lalumière. 

==Awards==
==Current projects==
Shainblum is collaborating on two webcomics projects: with artist Sandy Carruthers on a super-hero genre webcomic project entitled Canadiana, and on a mystery serial, &quot;The Haunting of MacGrath&quot; with artist Jeff Alward. He also works as a communications and media relations professional.

<text>Otto Everett Graham Jr. (December 6, 1921 – December 17, 2003) was an American professional football quarterback who played for the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons. Graham is regarded by critics as one of the most dominant players of his era and one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, having taken the Browns to league championship games every year between 1946 and 1955, making ten championship appearances, and winning seven of them. With Graham at quarterback, the Browns posted a record of 105 wins, 17 losses, and 4 ties, including a 9–3 win–loss record in the AAFC and NFL playoffs. He holds the NFL record for career average yards gained per pass attempt, with 8.63. He also holds the record for the highest career winning percentage for an NFL starting quarterback, at 81.0%. Long-time New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, a friend of Graham&#x27;s, once called him &quot;as great of a quarterback as there ever was.&quot;

Graham grew up in Waukegan, Illinois, the son of music teachers. He entered Northwestern University in 1940 on a basketball scholarship, but football soon became his main sport. After a brief stint in the military at the end of World War II, Graham played for the Rochester Royals of the National Basketball League (NBL), winning the 1945–46 championship. Paul Brown, Cleveland&#x27;s coach, signed Graham to play for the Browns, where he thrived. Graham&#x27;s 1946 NBL and AAFC titles made him the first of only two people to have won championships in two of the four major North American sports (the second was Gene Conley). After he retired from playing football in 1955, Graham coached college teams in the College All-Star Game and became head football coach for the Coast Guard Bears at the United States Coast Guard Academy. After seven years there, he was hired as head coach of the Washington Redskins in 1966. Following three unsuccessful years with them, he resigned and returned to the Coast Guard Academy, where he served as athletic director until his retirement in 1984. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965.

==Early life and college==
Born into a family of four boys in Waukegan, Illinois, Graham set a first state record at birth weighing 14 lbs 12 oz. Graham&#x27;s first interest growing up was music; both parents were music teachers. Encouraged by his parents—his father having taught famous comedian Jack Benny— he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, cornet and French horn. Graham also excelled in athletics, and attended Northwestern University on a basketball scholarship in 1940. There he played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman and continued to study music. Graham did not take up football until his sophomore year, when Northwestern coach Pappy Waldorf saw him throwing in an intramural game and invited him to practice with the team. Northwestern&#x27;s coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to sign up. Although football became Graham&#x27;s primary sport, he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team. As a senior, he was named a first-team basketball All-American.

He was a member of Alpha Delta Phi social fraternity (formerly The Wranglers).

Graham&#x27;s first game for the Northwestern Wildcats football team was on October 4, 1941, when he caught a Kansas State punt and returned it 90 yards for a touchdown. He ran and passed for two more touchdowns in the 51–3 victory. After scoring another pair of touchdowns in a win against Wisconsin, Graham passed to his wide receivers for two touchdowns in a victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes, coached by Paul Brown, the Buckeyes&#x27; only loss of the 1941 season. Northwestern ended the year with an 11th-place showing in the Associated Press Poll.

As America&#x27;s involvement in World War II intensified after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Graham signed up for service alongside many fellow student-athletes, entering the U.S. Coast Guard. He was able to stay at Northwestern as he waited to be called for active duty. The Wildcats struggled in 1942 as their players joined the war effort, winning only one game. Graham still had 89 completions, setting a single-season passing record in the Big Ten Conference, a division of major college teams from the Midwestern United States.

The following year, Military Enlistees from other schools enrolled at Northwestern, where the U.S. Navy had a training station. The 1943 season was a strong one for Northwestern. The team beat Ohio State, the defending national champions, and a good military team at Great Lakes Naval Station. The Wildcats lost to Notre Dame and Michigan, however, and finished the season with an 8–2 record and a ninth-place ranking in the AP Poll. Graham set another Big Ten passing record, was named the conference&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, received All-American honors and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting. By the end of his college career, he held a Big Ten Conference record for passing yards with 2,132.

Graham&#x27;s career at Northwestern officially ended in February 1944, when he moved to Colgate University in Hamilton, New York, in the Navy&#x27;s V-5 cadet program, a pilot training course. He played basketball for Colgate before moving to North Carolina Pre-Flight later in 1944, where he played on the Cloudbusters football team under coaches Glenn Killinger and Bear Bryant.

Impressed by Graham&#x27;s performances in Northwestern&#x27;s wins over Ohio State in 1941 and 1943, Paul Brown came and offered him a contract worth $7,500 per year ($ in dollars) in 1945 to play for a professional team he would be coaching in Cleveland in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Graham would not receive his salary until he started playing, however, and Brown added a monthly stipend of $250 ($ in ) until the end of the war. It was a large amount of money at the time. &quot;All I asked was, where do I sign?&quot; Graham said later. &quot;Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever.&quot; Graham was also drafted by the National Football League&#x27;s Detroit Lions, but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.

Large numbers of athletes came home as the conflict wound down in Europe following Germany&#x27;s surrender in mid-1945. The AAFC&#x27;s first season was not set to start until the fall of 1946, and Graham occupied the intervening months by joining the Rochester Royals of the National Basketball League (NBL), a forerunner of the National Basketball Association. In March 1946, the Royals swept a best-of-five series against the Sheboygan Red Skins to win the NBL title.

==Professional career==

===Cleveland Browns in the AAFC (1946–1949)===

By the time Graham was discharged from the Navy late in the summer of 1946, training camp for Brown&#x27;s new team, the Cleveland Browns, had already begun. Concerned that Graham was not ready to start, Brown put in Cliff Lewis at quarterback in the first game of the season. Graham, however, soon replaced Lewis in Brown&#x27;s T formation offense. Handing the ball to fullback Marion Motley and throwing to ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, Graham led the team to a 12–2 regular-season record and a spot in the championship game against the AAFC&#x27;s New York Yankees. The Browns won that game, touching off a period of dominance. The team won each of the AAFC&#x27;s four championships between 1946 and 1949, and had professional football&#x27;s second perfect season in 1948 by finishing undefeated and untied. By doing this the Browns became pro football&#x27;s first undefeated championship team. Between 1947 and 1949 the Browns played 29 consecutive games without a defeat.

Graham&#x27;s play was crucial to Cleveland&#x27;s success. He averaged 10.5 yards per pass and had a quarterback rating of 112.1 in 1946, a professional football record until Joe Montana surpassed it in 1989. Graham was named the AAFC&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1947 and shared the Most Valuable Player award with Frankie Albert of the San Francisco 49ers in 1948. He led the league in passing yards between 1947 and 1949. The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season, and three of its teams, including the Browns, merged into the more established National Football League. Graham was the AAFC&#x27;s all-time leading passer, throwing for 10,085 yards and 86 touchdowns.

Graham became the Browns&#x27; uncontested leader, but he was also &quot;just one of the guys&quot;, tackle Mike McCormack said in 1999. &quot;He was not aloof, which you see a lot of times today.&quot; He was good at spinning and moving in the pocket, skills he learned playing basketball. In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham&#x27;s ability to anticipate his receivers&#x27; route-running by watching their shoulders. &quot;I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm&quot;, Brown said. His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. &quot;I used to catch a lot of them one-handed&quot;, Lavelli said. &quot;He had great touch in his hands.&quot; He was nicknamed &quot;Automatic Otto&quot; for his consistency and toughness.

===Cleveland Browns in the NFL (1950–1955)===
With Graham at the helm, the Browns continued to succeed when they joined the NFL in 1950. Graham was voted the United Press NFL Player of the Year and led the Browns to a 10–2 record, which set up a playoff against the New York Giants for a spot in the championship game. The Browns&#x27; only two losses of the season had come against the Giants, but in a frozen Cleveland Stadium on Cleveland beat New York. With the game tied 3–3 in the fourth quarter, Graham gained 45 yards by running with the ball on a long drive to set up a 28-yard Lou Groza field goal that put the Browns ahead 6–3. A safety after the ensuing kickoff made the final score 8–3.

The win put Cleveland in the NFL championship game against the Los Angeles Rams. Graham&#x27;s rushing and passing were again key to the Browns&#x27; 30–28 victory. He drove the offense downfield as time expired to set up a last-minute Groza field goal that sealed the win. Graham had 99 yards rushing in the game, adding 298 yards of passing and four touchdowns.

Cleveland posted an 11–1 record in 1951, losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers in the season opener. That gave the Browns another spot in the championship game, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 24–17. Graham fumbled the ball in the third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14–10. Three of his throws were intercepted, but he put up 280 yards of passing and a touchdown. After the season, Graham was named the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.
With Graham at quarterback, Cleveland finished the 1952 season with a 9–3 record and faced the Detroit Lions in the NFL championship game. Despite gaining 384 total yards to Detroit&#x27;s 258, Graham, who was the NFL Player of the Year, and the Browns lost their second straight championship, 17–7. Cleveland had several long drives that ended with missed field goals, and a fourth-quarter touchdown was negated because Graham&#x27;s throw to Pete Brewster was first tipped by receiver Ray Renfro; under rules in place at the time, balls deflected by offensive teammates were automatic incompletions. After the season, as Graham was practicing for the Pro Bowl in Los Angeles on his six-week-old son Stephen died from a severe cold.

The 1953 season began with a 27–0 win over the Green Bay Packers in which Graham passed for 292 yards and ran for two touchdowns. It was the first of 11 straight victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season to the Philadelphia Eagles. Near the end of the season in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from Art Michalik that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches. Graham&#x27;s helmet was fitted with a clear plastic face mask, and he came back into the game; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask. Despite an 11–1 record, Cleveland lost in the championship game for the third year in a row, falling to the Detroit Lions 17–16. Two of Graham&#x27;s passes were intercepted. He said after the game that he wanted to &quot;jump off a building&quot; for letting his teammates down. &quot;I was the main factor in losing&quot;, he said. &quot;If I had played my usual game, we would have won.&quot; Still, Graham finished the season as the NFL&#x27;s leading passer and again won the Most Valuable Player award.

Before the start of the Browns&#x27; 1954 training camp, Graham was questioned as part of the Sam Sheppard murder case. Sheppard, an osteopath, was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple. Graham told police that while he and Beverly liked the Sheppards, they did not know much about their relationship.

The 1954 season was a transitional one for the Browns. Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were nearing the end of their careers. Graham, meanwhile, told Brown that he would retire after the season. After losing the first three games, Cleveland won eight in a row and earned another shot at the championship, again against the Lions. This time, the Browns won 56–10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed for three more. He announced his retirement after the game.
After Graham&#x27;s potential replacements struggled during the 1955 training camp and preseason, Brown convinced Graham to come back and play one more year. He was offered a salary of $25,000 ($ today), making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The Browns lost the opener against the Washington Redskins, but went on to a 9–2–1 regular-season record and another chance at a championship. Graham threw two touchdowns and ran for two more as the Browns beat the Rams 38–14. When Brown took Graham out of the game in the fourth quarter, the crowd in the Los Angeles Coliseum gave him a standing ovation. It was the final performance of a 10-year career in which Graham&#x27;s team reached the championship each year and won seven. &quot;Nothing would induce me to come back&quot;, he said later. He was the NFL&#x27;s passing leader and Most Valuable Player in 1955. He also won the Hickok Belt, awarded to the best professional athlete of the year. Without Graham, the Browns floundered the following year and posted a 5–7 record, their first losing season.

Graham and head coach Paul Brown created the modern T-formation quarterback position and the modern pro offense. Graham led his league in every major passing category each in multiple seasons and finished his career with a career all-time pro record Yds/Att of 9.0. Until 2016, he held the record for career rushing touchdowns by a pro quarterback with 44. The Browns&#x27; record with Graham as starting quarterback was 57–13–1, including a 9–3 record in the playoffs. He still holds the NFL career record for yards per pass attempt, averaging 8.63. He also holds the record for the highest career winning percentage for an NFL starting quarterback, with 0.810. Graham was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965. Having won seven championships in 10 seasons and reached the championship game in every year he played, Graham is regarded by sportswriters as one of the greatest winners of all time and one of the best professional quarterbacks to play the game. He never missed a game in his career.

Graham wore number 60 for much of his career, but he was forced to change it to 14 in 1952 after the NFL passed a rule requiring offensive linemen to wear jersey numbers 50–79 so referees could more easily identify ineligible receivers. The Browns retired his number 14, while 60 remains in circulation. While at Northwestern, Graham wore number 48.

==Coaching career==

When Graham retired from football, he planned to focus on managing the insurance and appliance businesses he owned. However, in 1957 Graham signed on as an assistant coach for the college squad in the annual College All-Star Game, an exhibition contest no longer played between the NFL champion and a selection of the best collegiate players from around the country. The next year, he was named head coach of the team. With Graham coaching the all-stars in 1958, the team beat the Detroit Lions 35–19.

===Coast Guard Academy===
Following his convincing win in the all-star game, Graham&#x27;s friend George Steinbrenner helped get him a job as the head football coach for the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. Graham, by then 37 years old, was also named athletic director and given a salary &quot;in five figures&quot;. School officials said the hiring did not mean Coast Guard would &quot;go big time&quot;; the Division III school played a relatively short schedule at the time against smaller schools in New England. The Coast Guard team had a 3–5 record in Graham&#x27;s first year as coach in 1959, but improved steadily over the ensuing three years. The team went undefeated in 1963, earning the academy its first-ever post-season bowl appearance. Coast Guard lost to Western Kentucky 27–0 in the Tangerine Bowl. Graham continued to coach in the College All-Star Game while at Coast Guard, and his college team beat Vince Lombardi&#x27;s Green Bay Packers in a 20–17 upset in 1963. Graham was offered coaching jobs in the NFL numerous times during his tenure at Coast Guard, but he said in 1964 that he was content to stay at the small school on a $9,000 salary. He said he deplored the &quot;win at all costs philosophy&quot; that was necessary to be successful in the professional ranks.

===Washington Redskins===

Despite his reservations about the professional game, Graham, who moonlighted as a television and radio commentator for the American Football League&#x27;s New York Jets in 1964 and 1965, left the Coast Guard Academy after seven years in 1966 to become head coach and general manager of the NFL&#x27;s Washington Redskins, Graham&#x27;s three seasons (1966–1968) were similarly unsuccessful, with an overall record of 17–22–3. With a 7–7 record in 1966, the Redskins slipped to 5–6–3 in 1967. Calls for his firing in 1968 intensified as the team&#x27;s performance worsened to 5–9; &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot; called for his firing in a front-page editorial in November. With two years remaining on a five-year contract (and an option for another five years), Graham was displaced by Vince Lombardi in early February 1969.

===Return to Coast Guard Academy===

After being dismissed as the Redskins&#x27; coach, Graham returned to the Coast Guard Academy as athletic director and said he planned to stay there until he retired. He coached the college team in the College All-Star Game in 1970 for his tenth and final time. The college stars lost for the seventh time in a row that year, falling 24–3 to the Kansas City Chiefs. He was replaced in 1971 by Blanton Collier, who had retired after succeeding Brown as Cleveland&#x27;s head coach.

In 1974, Graham was named Coast Guard&#x27;s football coach once again, although he resigned two years later to focus on his duties as athletic director. In nine years of coaching, Graham&#x27;s Coast Guard teams had a combined record of 44–32–1. After eight more years as the school&#x27;s athletic director, Graham retired in 1984.

==Later life and death==

An avid golfer and tennis player, Graham partnered with New York Yankees great Joe DiMaggio in numerous golf tournaments later in life. He retired to a house on a golf course in Florida. Graham overcame colon cancer in 1977, but was later plagued by heart ailments and other health problems. He was diagnosed as being in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2001, and died of a heart aneurysm in Sarasota, Florida, on December 17, 2003. He had two sons and a daughter with his wife Beverly. In 2013, Northwestern&#x27;s fundraising department created the Otto Graham Society to honor his achievements at the school and support its athletics programs. In 2014, a new gymnasium at Waterford Country School was dedicated to Otto Graham&#x27;s memory.

<doc id="407082" wikidata="Q77148" url="?curid=407082" title="Carl Schmitt">
<text>Carl Schmitt (11 July 1888 – 7 April 1985) was a German jurist, political theorist, and prominent member of the Nazi Party. He was the presiding legal expert at meetings during the early stages of the Third Reich that resulted in a formal decision to bypass the process of formulating a new constitution. An approach that would nominally maintain the former constitution was adopted, even though the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; (Leader Principle) was promoted to a transcendent supra-legal status. Schmitt claimed that the adoption of the Leader Principle in place of a legal constitution was legitimized by the presumed &quot;Volkisch&quot; or racial composition of the German people, and their identification with Adolf Hitler.

Schmitt wrote extensively about the effective wielding of political power. An authoritarian conservative theorist, he was noted as a critic of parliamentary democracy, liberalism, and cosmopolitanism. His works covered political theory, legal theory, continental philosophy, and political theology. However, they are controversial, mainly due to his intellectual support for, and active involvement with, Nazism. According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Schmitt was an acute observer and analyst of the weaknesses of liberal constitutionalism and liberal cosmopolitanism. But there can be little doubt that his preferred cure turned out to be infinitely worse than the disease.&quot;

==Early life==
Schmitt was born in Plettenberg, Westphalia, German Empire. His parents were Roman Catholics from the German Eifel region, who had settled in Plettenberg. His father was a minor businessman. Schmitt studied law at the Universities of Berlin, Munich, and Strasbourg, and took his graduation and state examinations in then-German Strasbourg in 1915. His 1910 doctoral thesis was titled (&quot;On Guilt and Types of Guilt&quot;).

Schmitt volunteered for the army in 1916. In the same year, he earned his habilitation at Strasbourg with a thesis entitled &quot;&quot; (The Value of the State and the Significance of the Individual). He then taught at various business schools and universities, namely the University of Greifswald (1921), the University of Bonn (1921), the Technical University of Munich (1928), the University of Cologne (1933), and the University of Berlin (1933–1945).

In 1916, Schmitt married his first wife, Pavla Dorotić, a Croatian woman who pretended to be a countess. They divorced, but an annulment was not granted by a Catholic tribunal, so his 1926 marriage to Duška Todorović (1903–1950), a Serbian woman, was not deemed valid under Catholic law.

As a young man, Schmitt was &quot;a devoted Catholic until his break with the church in the mid twenties&quot;. From around the end of the First World War, he began to describe his Catholicism as &quot;displaced&quot; and &quot;de-totalised&quot;.

While in Munich, Carl Schmitt attended Max Weber&#x27;s lectures, &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot;, &quot;Science as a Vocation&quot;, and the &quot;General Economic History&quot;. In 1923, he contributed to the second volume of &#x27;s &quot;&quot;

==Academic career==
In 1921, Schmitt became a professor at the University of Greifswald, where he published his essay &quot;Die Diktatur&quot; (on dictatorship).

In 1922, he published (&quot;Political Theology&quot;) while working as a professor at the University of Bonn. Schmitt changed universities in 1926, when he became professor of law at the Handelshochschule in Berlin, and again in 1932, when he accepted a position in Cologne. His most famous paper, (&quot;The Concept of the Political&quot;), was based on lectures at the in Berlin.

In 1932, Schmitt was counsel for the Reich government in the case &quot;Preussen contra Reich&quot; (Prussia vs. Reich), in which the SPD-controlled government of the state of Prussia disputed its dismissal by the right-wing Reich government of Franz von Papen. Papen was motivated by the fact that Prussia, by far the largest state in Germany, served as a powerful base for the political left and provided it with institutional power, particularly in the form of the Prussian police. Schmitt, Carl Bilfinger, and Erwin Jacobi represented the Reich, and one of the counsel for the Prussian government was Hermann Heller. In October 1932, the court ruled that the Prussian government had been suspended unlawfully but that the Reich had the right to install a commissar. In German history, the struggle that resulted in the de facto destruction of federalism in the Weimar republic is known as the &quot;Preußenschlag&quot;.

==Hitler&#x27;s seizure of control==
On 31 January 1933, Schmitt remarked that with Adolf Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor, &quot;one can say that &#x27;Hegel died. Richard Wolin observes:

The Nazis engineered the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933 in March, which changed the Weimar Constitution to allow the &quot;present government&quot; to rule by decree, bypassing both the President, Paul von Hindenburg, and the Reichstag.

Alfred Hugenberg, the leader of the German National People&#x27;s Party, one of the Nazis&#x27; partners in the coalition government that was being squeezed out of existence, hoped to slow the Nazi takeover of the country by threatening to quit his cabinet position. Hugenberg reasoned that by doing so, the government would be changed, and the Enabling Act would no longer apply, as the &quot;present government&quot; would no longer exist. A legal opinion by Schmitt prevented this manoeuvre from succeeding. Well known at the time as a constitutional theorist, Schmitt declared that &quot;present government&quot; did not refer to the cabinet&#x27;s makeup when the act was passed, but to the &quot;completely different kind of government&quot;—that is, different from the democracy of the Weimar Republic—that the Hitler cabinet had brought into existence.

==Nazi Party==

Schmitt joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933. Within days, he rejoiced in the burning of &quot;un-German&quot; and &quot;anti-German&quot; material by Jewish authors, and called for a much more extensive purge, to include works by authors influenced by &quot;Jewish&quot; ideas. From June 1933, he was in the leadership council of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law and served as chairman of the Committee for State and Administrative Law. In July, Hermann Göring appointed him to the Prussian State Council, and in November he became the president of the Association of National Socialist German Jurists. He also replaced Heller as a professor at the University of Berlin, a position he held until the end of World War II. He presented his theories as an ideological foundation of the Nazi dictatorship and a justification of the &quot;Führer&quot; state concerning legal philosophy, particularly through the concept of &quot;auctoritas&quot;.

In June 1934, Schmitt was appointed editor-in-chief of the Nazi newspaper for lawyers, the &quot;&quot; (&quot;German Jurists&#x27; Journal&quot;). In July he published in it &quot;The Leader Protects the Law (&quot;Der Führer schützt das Recht&quot;)&quot;, a justification of the political murders of the Night of the Long Knives with Hitler&#x27;s authority as the &quot;highest form of administrative justice (&quot;höchste Form administrativer Justiz&quot;)&quot;. Schmitt presented himself as a radical antisemite and was the chairman of an October 1936 law teachers&#x27; convention in Berlin at which he demanded that German law be cleansed of the &quot;Jewish spirit (&quot;jüdischem Geist&quot;)&quot; and that all Jewish scientists&#x27; publications be marked with a small symbol.

Nevertheless, in December 1936, the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) publication &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; accused Schmitt of being an opportunist, a Hegelian state thinker, and a Catholic, and called his antisemitism a mere pretense, citing earlier statements in which he criticized the Nazis&#x27; racial theories. After this, Schmitt resigned as &quot;Reichsfachgruppenleiter&quot; (Reich Professional Group Leader) but retained his professorship in Berlin and his title &quot;Prussian State Councillor&quot;. Schmitt continued to be investigated into 1937, but Göring stopped further reprisals.

During the German occupation of Paris, a &quot;round-table&quot; of French and German intellectuals met at the Georges V Hotel, including Schmitt, the writers Ernst Jünger, Paul Morand, Jean Cocteau, and Henry de Montherlant, and the publisher Gaston Gallimard.

==After World War II==
In 1945, American forces captured Schmitt and, after spending more than a year in an internment camp, he returned to his home town of Plettenberg and, later, to the residence of his housekeeper Anni Stand in Plettenberg-Pasel. He remained unrepentant for his role in the creation of the Nazi state and, by refusing every attempt at denazification, he was barred from academic jobs. Despite being isolated from the mainstream of the scholarly and political community, from the 1950s on he continued his studies, especially of international law, and frequently received visitors, both colleagues and younger intellectuals, well into his old age. Among the visitors were Ernst Jünger, Jacob Taubes, and Alexandre Kojève.

In 1962, Schmitt gave lectures in Francoist Spain, two of which resulted in the publication, the next year, of &quot;Theory of the Partisan&quot;, in which he characterized the Spanish Civil War as a &quot;war of national liberation&quot; against &quot;international Communism&quot;. Schmitt regarded the partisan as a specific and significant phenomenon which, during the latter half of the 20th century, indicated the emergence of a new theory of warfare.

Schmitt and Todorović had a daughter, Anima, who, in 1957, married Alfonso Otero Varela (1925–2001), a Spanish law professor at the University of Santiago de Compostela and a member of the ruling FET y de las JONS party in Francoist Spain. She translated several of her father&#x27;s works into Spanish. Letters from Schmitt to his son-in-law have been published. Schmitt died on 7 April 1985 and is buried in Plettenberg.

==Publications==
===&quot;The Dictatorship&quot;===
In his essay &quot;Die Diktatur&quot; (&quot;The Dictatorship&quot;), he discussed the foundations of the newly established Weimar Republic, emphasising the office of the President of Germany. In this essay, Schmitt compared and contrasted what he saw as the effective and ineffective elements of the new constitution of his country. He saw the office of the president as a comparatively effective element, because of the power granted to the president to declare a state of exception (&quot;Ausnahmezustand&quot;). This power, which Schmitt discussed and implicitly praised as dictatorial, was more in line with the underlying mentality of executive power than the comparatively slow and ineffective processes of legislative power reached through parliamentary discussion and compromise.

Schmitt was at pains to remove what he saw as a taboo surrounding the concept of &quot;dictatorship&quot; and to show that the concept is implicit whenever power is wielded by means other than the slow processes of parliamentary politics and the bureaucracy:

For Schmitt, every government capable of decisive action must include a dictatorial element within its constitution. Although the German concept of &quot;Ausnahmezustand&quot; is best translated as &quot;state of emergency&quot;, it literally means &quot;state of exception&quot; which, according to Schmitt, frees the executive from any legal restraints to its power that would normally apply. The use of the term &quot;exceptional&quot; has to be underlined here: Schmitt defines sovereignty as the power to &quot;decide&quot; to initiate a state of exception, as Giorgio Agamben has noted. According to Agamben, Schmitt&#x27;s conceptualization of the &quot;state of exception&quot; as belonging to the core-concept of sovereignty was a response to Walter Benjamin&#x27;s concept of a &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;revolutionary&quot; violence, which did not enter into any relationship whatsoever with right. Through the state of exception, Schmitt included all types of violence under right, in the case of the authority of Hitler leading to the formulation &quot;The leader defends the law&quot; (&quot;Der Führer schützt das Recht&quot;).

Schmitt opposed what he termed &quot;commissarial dictatorship&quot;, or the declaration of a state of emergency in order to save the legal order (a temporary suspension of law, defined itself by moral or legal right): the state of emergency is limited (even if &quot;a posteriori&quot;, by law) to &quot;sovereign dictatorship&quot;, in which law was suspended, as in the classical state of exception, not to &quot;save the Constitution&quot;, but rather to create another constitution. This is how he theorized Adolf Hitler&#x27;s continual suspension of the legal constitutional order during the Third Reich (the Weimar Republic&#x27;s Constitution was never abrogated, emphasized Giorgio Agamben; rather, it was &quot;suspended&quot; for four years, first with the 28 February 1933 Reichstag Fire Decree, with the suspension renewed every four years, implying a continual state of emergency).

===&quot;Political Theology&quot; ===
&quot;On Dictatorship&quot; was followed by another essay in 1922, titled &quot;Politische Theologie&quot; (political theology); in it, Schmitt, gave further substance to his authoritarian theories with the now notorious definition: &quot;The sovereign is he who decides on the exception.&quot; By &quot;exception&quot;, Schmitt means stepping outside the rule of law under the state of exception (&quot;Ausnahmezustand&quot;) doctrine he first introduced in &quot;On Dictatorship&quot; for the purpose of managing some crisis, which Schmitt defines loosely as &quot;a case of extreme peril, a danger to the existence of the state, or the like.&quot; For this reason, the &quot;exception&quot; is understood as a &quot;borderline concept&quot; for Schmitt because it is not within the purview of the normal legal order. Schmitt opposes this definition of sovereignty to those offered by contemporary theorists on the issue, particularly Hans Kelsen, whose work is criticized at several points in the essay. The state of exception is a critique of &quot;normativism&quot;, a positivist concept of law developed by Kelsen of law as the expression of norms that are abstract and generally applicable, in all circumstances.

A year later, Schmitt supported the emergence of totalitarian power structures in his paper &quot;Die geistesgeschichtliche Lage des heutigen Parlamentarismus&quot; (roughly: &quot;The Intellectual-Historical Situation of Today&#x27;s Parliamentarianism&quot;, translated as &quot;The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy&quot; by Ellen Kennedy). Schmitt criticized the institutional practices of liberal politics, arguing that they are justified by a faith in rational discussion and openness that is at odds with actual parliamentary party politics, in which outcomes are hammered out in smoke-filled rooms by party leaders. Schmitt also posits an essential division between the liberal doctrine of separation of powers and what he holds to be the nature of democracy itself, the identity of the rulers and the ruled. Although many critics of Schmitt today, such as Stephen Holmes in his &quot;The Anatomy of Anti-Liberalism&quot;, take exception to his fundamentally authoritarian outlook, the idea of incompatibility between liberalism and democracy is one reason for the continued interest in his political philosophy.

In chapter 4 of his &quot;State of Exception&quot; (2005), Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben argued that Schmitt&#x27;s &quot;Political Theology&quot; ought to be read as a response to Walter Benjamin&#x27;s influential essay &quot;Towards the Critique of Violence&quot;.

The book&#x27;s title derives from Schmitt&#x27;s assertion (in chapter 3) that &quot;all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts&quot;—in other words, that political theory addresses the state (and sovereignty) in much the same manner as theology does God.

===&quot;The Concept of the Political&quot;===
For Schmitt, &quot;the political&quot; is not equal to any other domain, such as the economic (which distinguishes between profitable and not profitable), but instead is the most essential to identity. While churches are predominant in religion or society is predominant in economics, the state is usually predominant in politics. Yet, for Schmitt, the political was not autonomous or equivalent to the other domains, but rather the existential basis that would determine any other domain should it reach the point of politics (e.g. religion ceases to be merely theological when it makes a clear distinction between the &quot;friend&quot; and the &quot;enemy&quot;).

He views political concepts and images as inherently contestable. Hegemonic powers seek to control and direct how political concepts are applied for a purpose and to effect an outcome such as making the enemy knowable and, in all cases, intended to manifest the inclusive and exclusive aspects of the social order represented by the political words and symbolism:

Schmitt, in perhaps his best-known formulation, bases his conceptual realm of state sovereignty and autonomy upon the distinction between &quot;friend&quot; and &quot;enemy&quot;. Schmitt writes:

This distinction is to be determined &quot;existentially&quot;, which is to say that the enemy is whoever is &quot;in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible&quot;. Such an enemy need not even be based on nationality: so long as the conflict is potentially intense enough to become a violent one between political entities, the actual substance of enmity may be anything. In this work, Schmitt makes the distinction between several different types of enemies one may make, stating that political enemies ought to be made out of a legitimate concern for the safety of the state rather than moral intuitions.

The collectivization of friendship and enmity is, for Schmitt, the essence of politics. This theory of politics was influential in the Third Reich where the recognition and eradication of the enemy became a necessary component of the collective national identity. Similar views were shared by other Nazi legal theorists like Werner Best. Although there have been divergent interpretations concerning this work, there is broad agreement that &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot; is an attempt to achieve state unity by defining the content of politics as opposition to the &quot;enemy&quot;. Additionally, the prominence of the state stands as an arbitrary force dominating potentially fractious civil society, whose various antagonisms must not be allowed to affect politics, lest civil war result.

===&quot;Political Romanticism&quot;===
Schmitt&#x27;s &quot;Political Romanticism&quot; (1926) contains Schmitt&#x27;s critique of Romantic conservatism, which he considers unrealistic for the political arena of the modern era as it only seeks a restoration of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, which Schmitt considers unfeasible. Distancing himself from the tradition of legitimist &quot;restorative conservatives&quot; such as Adam Müller or Joseph de Maistre, Schmitt instead champions the thought of the 19th century Spanish reactionary thinker Juan Donoso Cortés, who advocated for a dictatorship.

According to György Lukács, this text is both the starting point of Schmitt&#x27;s advocacy for a politics of realism and his extreme anti-humanism. Lukács quotes Schmitt&#x27;s comment that Cortes&#x27;s &#x27;great theoretical significance for the history of counter-revolutionary theory lies in [that] his contempt for human beings knew no bounds; their blind understanding, their feeble wills, the derisory elan of their carnal desires seem so pitiful to him that all the vocabulary of all human languages is not sufficient to express the full baseness of these creatures,&#x27; and Lukács writes:

Here we clearly perceive Schmitt&#x27;s association with all anti-human tendencies, past and present, along with the reason for it in socio-human terms: he is an enemy of the masses grown blind with hatred, a fanatic in the campaign against &quot;Vermassung&quot; or mass feeling.

====Dialogue with Leo Strauss====
Schmitt provided a positive reference for Leo Strauss, and approved his work, which was instrumental in winning Strauss the scholarship funding that allowed him to leave Germany. In turn, Strauss&#x27;s critique and clarifications of &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot; led Schmitt to make significant emendations in its second edition. Writing to Schmitt during 1932, Strauss summarized Schmitt&#x27;s political theology thus: &quot;[B]ecause man is by nature evil, he therefore needs &quot;dominion&quot;. But dominion can be established, that is, men can be unified only in a unity against—against other men. Every association of men is necessarily a separation from other men… the political thus understood is not the constitutive principle of the state, of order, but a condition of the state.&quot;

=== &quot;The Leviathan in the State Theory of Thomas Hobbes&quot; ===
&quot;The Leviathan in the State Theory of Thomas Hobbes&quot;, with the subtitle &quot;Meaning and Failure of a Political Symbol&quot;, is a 1938 work by Schmitt that revisits one of his most critical theoretical inspirations: Thomas Hobbes. Schmitt&#x27;s work can be described as both a critique and appraisal of the controversial political theorist. This work also contains some of Schmitt&#x27;s more anti-Semitic language. As contemporary writers on Schmitt have noted, his anti-Semitism may be read as more a kind of &quot;anti-Judaism&quot; as, unlike his Nazi allies, he did not attribute the dangers of Judaism to &quot;biological&quot; reasons but strictly religious ones. This work by Schmitt is also one of the most intimately involved by him with the concept of myth in a political setting.

The text itself begins with an overview of the religious history of the mythical character &quot;Leviathan&quot;. Schmitt traces this character as a unique subject of conflicting interpretations in Abrahamic doctrines, whereby the Leviathan, understood most pointedly as a &quot;big fish,&quot; is occasionally interchangeable with that of a dragon or serpent, which Schmitt remarks have been &quot;protective and benevolent deities&quot; in the history of non-Jewish peoples. But, as Schmitt makes clear, Hobbes&#x27; Leviathan is very different from these interpretations, being illustrated firstly in his work &quot;Leviathan&quot; as a &quot;huge man&quot;. The Leviathan as a &quot;huge man&quot; is used throughout Hobbes&#x27; work as a symbol of the sovereign person. Although the Leviathan is not the only allegory made by Hobbes of the sovereign, which gravitates throughout his work as &quot;a huge man, a huge leviathan, an artificial being, an &quot;animal artificiale&quot;, an &quot;automaton&quot;, or a &quot;machina&quot;&quot;. Hobbes&#x27; concern was mainly to convey the sovereign person as a frightening creature that could instill fear into those chaotic elements of man that belong to his interpretation of the state of nature.

Schmitt&#x27;s critique of Hobbes begins with Hobbes&#x27; understanding of the state as a &quot;machine&quot; which is set into motion by the sovereign. That, according to Schmitt, is actually a continuation of René Descartes&#x27;s concept of mind–body dualism. For Hobbes to conceptualize the state as a machine whose soul is the sovereign renders it really as just a mechanic structure, carrying over the cartesian dualism into political theory: &quot;As a totality, the state is body and soul, a &quot;homo artificialis&quot;, and, as such, a machine. It is a manmade product... the soul thereby becomes a mere component of a machine artificially manufactured by man.&quot; Schmitt adds that this technical conception of the state is essential in the modern interpretation of government as a widespread administrative organ. Therefore, Schmitt attributes Hobbes&#x27; mechanistic and often also a legally positivist interpretation of the state (what is legitimate = what is legal) with the process of political neutralization. This is consistent with Schmitt&#x27;s larger attitude toward attempts to apply technical principles to political matters.

Also, Schmitt critiques Hobbes&#x27; insistence that belief in miracles must only be outwardly consistent with the position of the state and can, privately, deviate into one&#x27;s own opinion as to the validity of such &quot;miracles&quot;. The belief in miracles was a relevant point in Hobbes&#x27; century for kings would regularly &quot;bestow miracles&quot; by touching the hands of those of ill health, supposedly healing them—obviously a consequence of the medieval belief that kings had a divine character. Hobbes&#x27; position was that &quot;private reason&quot; may disagree with what the state claims to be a miracle, but the &quot;public reason&quot; must by necessity agree to its position in order to avoid chaos. Schmitt&#x27;s critique of Hobbes here is twofold. Firstly, Hobbes opens the crack toward a liberal understanding of individual rights (such as the right to &quot;private reason&quot;) which Schmitt was a tireless critic of and, secondly, Hobbes guts the state of any &quot;substantive truth&quot; (such as the genuine belief of the individual, even in private, of the kings divine right) and renders the state into now simply a &quot;justifiable external power&quot;. This opens up the elementary basis of liberal society which, for Schmitt, was pluralism. Such a pluralist society lacked ideological homogeneity and nationally bound group identity, both of which were fundamental premises of a democratic society to Schmitt. Despite his critiques, Schmitt, nonetheless, finishes the book with a celebration of Hobbes as a truly magnificent thinker, ranking him along with other theorists he values greatly like Niccolò Machiavelli and Giambattista Vico.

===&quot;The Nomos of the Earth&quot;===
&quot;The Nomos of the Earth&quot; is Schmitt&#x27;s most historical and geopolitical work. Published in 1950, it was also one of his final texts. It describes the origin of the Eurocentric global order, which Schmitt dates from the discovery of the New World, discusses its specific character and its contribution to civilization, analyses the reasons for its decline at the end of the 19th century, and concludes with prospects for a new world order. It defends European achievements, not only in creating the first truly global order of international law, but also in limiting war to conflicts among sovereign states, which, in effect, civilized war. In Schmitt&#x27;s view, the European sovereign state was the greatest achievement of Occidental rationalism; in becoming the principal agency of secularization, the European state created the modern age.

Notable in Schmitt&#x27;s discussion of the European epoch of world history is the role played by the New World, which ultimately replaced the Old World as the centre of the Earth and became the arbiter in European and world politics. According to Schmitt, the United States&#x27; internal conflicts between economic presence and political absence, between isolationism and interventionism, are global problems, which today continue to hamper the creation of a new world order. But however critical Schmitt is of American actions at the end of the 19th century and after World War I, he considered the United States to be the only political entity capable of resolving the crisis of global order.

===&quot;Hamlet or Hecuba&quot;===
Published in 1956, &quot;Hamlet or Hecuba: The Intrusion of the Time into the Play&quot; was Schmitt&#x27;s most extended piece of literary criticism. In it, Schmitt focuses his attention on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and argues that the significance of the work hinges on its ability to integrate history in the form of the taboo of the queen and the deformation of the figure of the avenger. Schmitt uses this interpretation to develop a theory of myth and politics that serves as a cultural foundation for his concept of political representation. Beyond literary criticism or historical analysis, Schmitt&#x27;s book also reveals a comprehensive theory of the relationship between aesthetics and politics that responds to alternative ideas developed by Walter Benjamin and Theodor W. Adorno.

===&quot;Theory of the Partisan&quot;===
Schmitt&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Partisan&quot; originated in two lectures delivered during 1962, and has been seen as a rethinking of &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot;. It addressed the transformation of war in the post-European age, analysing a specific and significant phenomenon that ushered in a new theory of war and enmity. It contains an implicit theory of the terrorist, which during the 21st century has resulted in yet another new theory of war and enmity. In the lectures, Schmitt directly tackles the issues surrounding &quot;the problem of the Partisan&quot; figure: the guerrilla or revolutionary who &quot;fights irregularly&quot; (p. 3). Both because of its scope, with extended discussions on historical figures like Napoleon, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Zedong, as well as the events marking the beginning of the 20th century, Schmitt&#x27;s text has had a resurgence of popularity. Jacques Derrida, in his &quot;Politics of Friendship&quot; remarked:
Despite certain signs of ironic distrust in the areas of metaphysics and ontology, &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot; was, as we have seen, a philosophical type of essay to &#x27;frame&#x27; the topic of a concept unable to constitute itself on philosophical ground. But in &quot;Theory of the Partisan&quot;, it is in the same areas that the topic of this concept is both radicalized and properly uprooted, where Schmitt wished to regrasp in history the event or node of events that engaged this uprooting radicalization, and it is precisely there that the philosophical as such intervenes again.
Schmitt concludes &quot;Theory of the Partisan&quot; with the statement: &quot;The theory of the partisan flows into the question of the concept of the political, into the question of the real enemy and of a new &quot;nomos&quot; of the earth.&quot; Schmitt&#x27;s work on the Partisan has since spurred comparisons with the post-9/11 &#x27;terrorist&#x27; in recent scholarship. The Italian philosopher Domenico Losurdo comments:

Thus, for Schmitt, the colonized peoples&#x27; struggle for national independence, although embracing ever larger sections of the population, becomes synonymous with terrorism, while the actions of the occupying army, foreign and hated by the citizens of the occupied country, are characterized as &quot;counter-terrorist&quot;. Of course, the &quot;retaliations&quot; can be very harsh, but - Schmitt observes, referring to Algeria and Vietnam - we must take into account the &quot;irresistible logic of the old rule according to which insurgents can only be dealt with by insurgent methods.&quot; As we see, the main difference between terrorism and counter-terrorism is not a specific behavior (ie. the impact on, or participation of, citizens). It coincides with the border between barbarism and civilization, between East and West. The power that determines who the barbarians are every time also determines who the terrorists are.

==Influence==

Through Walter Benjamin, Giorgio Agamben, Andrew Arato, Chantal Mouffe and other writers, Schmitt has become a common reference in recent writings of the intellectual left as well as the right. These discussions concern not only the interpretation of Schmitt&#x27;s own positions, but also matters relevant to contemporary politics: the idea that laws of the state cannot strictly limit actions of its sovereign, the problem of a &quot;state of exception&quot; (later expanded upon by Agamben).

Schmitt&#x27;s argument that political concepts are &quot;secularized theological concepts&quot; has also recently been seen as consequential for those interested in contemporary political theology. The German-Jewish philosopher Jacob Taubes, for example, engaged Schmitt widely in his study of Saint Paul, &quot;The Political Theology of Paul&quot; (Stanford Univ. Press, 2004). Taubes&#x27; understanding of political theology is, however, very different from Schmitt&#x27;s, and emphasizes the political aspect of theological claims, rather than the religious derivation of political claims.

Schmitt is described as a &quot;classic of political thought&quot; by Herfried Münkler, while in the same article Münkler speaks of his post-war writings as reflecting an &quot;embittered, jealous, occasionally malicious man&quot; (&quot;verbitterten, eifersüchtigen, gelegentlich bösartigen Mann&quot;). Schmitt was termed the &quot;Crown Jurist of the Third Reich&quot; (&quot;Kronjurist des Dritten Reiches&quot;) by Waldemar Gurian.

According to historian Renato Cristi in the writing of the 1980 Constitution of Chile, Pinochet collaborator Jaime Guzmán based his work on the &quot;pouvoir constituant&quot; concept used by Schmitt (as well as drawing inspiration in the ideas of market society of Friedrich Hayek). This way Guzmán would have enabled a framework for a dictatorial state combined with a free market economic system.

Schmitt&#x27;s anti-parliamentarian political theory received renewed attention as a historical reference with immediate contemporary relevance during the electoral cycles and administrations of the U.S. President Donald Trump.

===Law of emergency powers===

Schmitt&#x27;s &quot;state of exception&quot; doctrine has enjoyed a revival in the 21st century. Formulated 10 years before the 1933 Nazi takeover of Germany, Schmitt claimed that urgency justified the following:

#Special executive powers
#Suspension of the Rule of Law
#Derogation of legal and constitutional rights

Schmitt&#x27;s doctrine helped clear the way for Hitler&#x27;s rise to power by providing the theoretical legal foundation of the Nazi regime.

===China===
Some have argued that Schmitt has become an important influence on Chinese political theory in the 21st century, particularly since Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012. Leading Chinese Schmittians include the theologian Liu Xiaofeng, the public policy scholar Wang Shaoguang, and the legal theorist and government adviser Jiang Shigong. Schmitt&#x27;s ideas have proved popular and useful instruments in justifying the legitimacy of Chinese Communist Party rule.

The first important wave of Schmitt&#x27;s reception in China started with Liu&#x27;s writings at the end of the 1990s. In the context of a transition period, Schmitt was used both by liberal, nationalist and conservative intellectuals to find answers to contemporary issues. In the 21st century, most of them are still concerned with state power and to what extent a strong state is required to tackle China&#x27;s modernization. Some authors consider Schmitt&#x27;s works as a weapon against liberalism. Others think that his theories are helpful for China&#x27;s development.

A critical reception of his use in a Chinese context does also exist. These differences go together with different interpretations of Schmitt&#x27;s relation with fascism. While some scholars regard him as a faithful follower of fascism, others, such as Liu Xiaofeng, consider his support to the Nazi regime only as instrumental and attempt to separate his works from their historical context. According to them, his real goal is to pave a different and unique way for the modernization of Germany—precisely what makes him interesting for China. Generally speaking, the Chinese reception is ambivalent: quite diverse and dynamic, but also highly ideological. Other scholars are cautious when it comes to Schmitt&#x27;s arguments for state power, considering the danger of totalitarianism, they assume at the same time that state power is necessary for the current transition and that a &quot;dogmatic faith&quot; in liberalism is unsuitable for China. By emphasizing the danger of social chaos, many of them agree with Schmitt—beyond their differences—on the necessity of a strong state.

=== Other countries ===
Among other things, his work is considered to have influenced neoconservatism in the United States. Most notably the legal opinions offered by Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo et al. by invoking the unitary executive theory to justify the Bush administration&#x27;s legally controversial decisions during the War on terror (such as introducing unlawful combatant status which purportedly would eliminate protection by the Geneva Conventions, the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse, the National Security Agency&#x27;s electronic surveillance program and various excesses of the Patriot Act) mimic his writings. Professor David Luban points out that the American legal database Lexis.com has five references to Schmitt in the period between 1980 and 1990, 114 between 1990 and 2000, and 420 between 2000 and 2010, with almost twice as many in the last five years of the 2000s decade as the first five.

Several scholars have noted the influence of Carl Schmitt on Vladimir Putin and Russia, specifically in defence of illiberal norms and exercising power, such as in disputes with Ukraine. Timothy Snyder has asserted that Schmitt&#x27;s work has greatly influenced Eurasianist philosophy in Russia by revealing a counter to the liberal order. Nomma Zarubina, who was accused by the FBI of being a secret operative of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), said in an interview that her father named her &quot;Nomma&quot; after Schmitt&#x27;s work &quot;The Nomos of the Earth&quot;.

<doc id="407083" wikidata="Q157740" url="?curid=407083" title="President of Germany (1919–1945)">
<text>The president of Germany (, ) was the head of state under the Weimar Constitution, which was officially in force from 1919 to 1945, encompassing the periods of the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany.

The Weimar constitution created a semi-presidential system in which power was divided between president, cabinet and parliament. The president was directly elected under universal adult suffrage for a seven-year term, although Germany&#x27;s first president, Friedrich Ebert, was elected by the Weimar National Assembly rather than the people. The intention of the framers of the constitution was that the president would rule in conjunction with the Reichstag (legislature) and that his extensive emergency powers would be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances. The political instability of the Weimar period and an increasingly severe factionalism in the legislature, however, led to the president occupying a position of considerable power, legislating by decree and appointing and dismissing governments at will.

In 1934, after the death of President Hindenburg, Adolf Hitler, who was already chancellor, assumed the powers of the presidency as Führer und Reichskanzler (&quot;Leader and Chancellor&quot;). In his last will in April 1945, Hitler named Karl Dönitz president, thus briefly reviving the presidential office until just after the German surrender in May 1945.

The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany established the office of Federal President (), which is a chiefly ceremonial post largely devoid of political power.

== Constitutional definition ==
The governmental structure established by the Weimar Constitution was a mix of presidential and parliamentary systems, with a strong president as a kind of &quot;replacement emperor&quot; (). Hugo Preuss, who wrote the initial draft of the constitution, intended the president to be above political parties and a counterweight to the Reichstag. He wanted the office to be a block to the &quot;parliamentary absolutism&quot; that he feared might otherwise develop. Preuss&#x27; decision to have a president as head of state was influenced by constitutional scholar Robert Redslob and sociologist Max Weber.

The constitution did not require that a vote of no confidence be constructive – that is, the Reichstag had the power to make a government resign without the burden of being sure that a new one could be formed. Friedrich Ebert and Paul von Hindenburg (initially) both attempted to appoint chancellors who were able to build coalitions that had the confidence of the Reichstag. Thirteen of the twenty Weimar governments (not counting Hitler&#x27;s) were nevertheless minority cabinets when they took office.

=== Election ===
The president was directly elected by universal adult suffrage for a term of seven years. Re-election was not limited. The presidency was open to all German citizens who had reached 36 years of age. The direct election of the president occurred under a form of the two round system. If no candidate received the support of an absolute majority in the first round of voting, a second round was held at a later date. In that round, the candidate who received the most votes – whether or not it constituted a majority – was elected. A group could nominate a substitute candidate in the second round in place of the candidate it had supported in the first.

The president could not be a member of the Reichstag at the same time. The constitution required that on taking office the president take the following oath:

:I swear that I will devote my energy to the welfare of the German people, increase its wellbeing, protect it from harm, uphold the constitution of the Reich and its laws, conscientiously fulfil my duties and exercise justice towards all.

=== Duties and functions ===
The requirements and responsibilities of the president were laid out in Section III (Articles 41–59) of the Weimar Constitution.
* &quot;Appointment of the government&quot;: The president appointed and removed the chancellor and, on the chancellor&#x27;s recommendation, the members of the cabinet. No vote of confirmation was required in the Reichstag before the members took office, but any member was obliged to resign if the Reichstag passed a vote of no confidence in him. The president could appoint and dismiss the chancellor at will, but all other cabinet members could, except in the event of a no confidence motion, be appointed or dismissed only at the chancellor&#x27;s request.
* &quot;Dissolution of the Reichstag&quot;: The president had the right to dissolve the Reichstag at any time (Article 25), in which case a general election had to occur within sixty days. He was not permitted to do so more than once for the same reason.
* &quot;Promulgation of the law&quot;: The president was responsible for signing bills into law. He was constitutionally obliged to sign every law passed in accordance with the correct procedure but could insist that a bill first be submitted to the electorate in a referendum. Such a referendum could override the decision of the Reichstag only if a majority of eligible voters participated and a majority of them voted yes.
* &quot;Foreign relations&quot;: The president represented the nation in its foreign affairs, accredited and received ambassadors, and concluded treaties in the name of the state. Approval of the Reichstag was required to declare war, conclude peace and to ratify any treaty that related to German laws.
* &quot;Commander-in-chief&quot;: The president held supreme command of the armed forces.
* &quot;Amnesties&quot;: The president had the right to confer amnesties.

==== Emergency powers ====
The Weimar Constitution granted the president sweeping powers in the event of a crisis. If &quot;public order and security [were] seriously disturbed or threatened&quot;, Article 48 gave the president the power to &quot;take the necessary measures to restore public safety and order&quot;. The permissible steps included the use of armed force, the suspension of many of the civil rights guaranteed by the constitution and forcing a state government to cooperate if it failed to meet its obligations under the constitution or federal law. Most importantly, the president could issue emergency decrees which had the same legal force as laws passed by parliament. Per Article 50, all presidential decrees had to be counter-signed by the chancellor or competent national minister. The Reichstag had to be informed immediately of any measures taken under Article 48 and had the right to reverse any such measures.

=== Removal and succession ===
The Weimar Constitution did not provide for a vice presidency. Article 51 stated that if the president died or left office prematurely, a successor would be elected. During a temporary vacancy, the powers and functions of the presidency passed to the chancellor. A December 1932 constitutional amendment made the president of the &quot;Reichsgericht&quot; (Germany&#x27;s highest civil and criminal court) the interim president.

Under Article 45, the president could be removed from office prematurely by a popular referendum initiated by the Reichstag. To require such a referendum, the Reichstag had to pass a motion supported by at least two-thirds of votes cast in the chamber. If the proposal was rejected by voters, the president would be deemed to have been re-elected and the Reichstag would be dissolved.

The Reichstag had authority (Article 59) to impeach the president before the State Court for the German Reich, the court which handled disputes between state bodies. The Reichstag could only do so on a charge of wilfully violating German law. The move to impeach had to be supported by a two-thirds majority of the Reichstag members at a meeting with at least two-thirds of the members present.

==History==
=== Friedrich Ebert ===

On 11 February 1919, the Weimar National Assembly elected Friedrich Ebert of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) the first Reich president by a vote of 379 to 277. The first regular presidential election was to have taken place when the Weimar Constitution came into effect in August 1919, but the continuing turmoil in the Republic caused the Reichstag to postpone it repeatedly, until in late 1922 it extended Ebert&#x27;s term to 30 June 1925. The change required amending Article 180 of the constitution.

Due in large part to the ongoing political violence during the early years of the Republic, Ebert used Article 48 on 136 occasions, although he always based invoking the act on agreements between himself, the government and parliament. In October 1923, when the Communist Party of Germany entered the Social Democratic-led governments of Saxony and Thuringia with hidden revolutionary intentions, Ebert used a &quot;Reichsexekution&quot; under Article 48 to send troops into the two states to remove the Communists from the governments. Ebert later granted Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno considerable latitude under Article 48 to deal with Germany&#x27;s hyperinflation. It was a more controversial use of the power because it was not clear that the constitutional article was meant to be used to handle economic issues.

There were twelve governments while Ebert was president (six of them minority when they took office) and three Reichstag elections.

=== Paul von Hindenburg ===
Ebert&#x27;s presidency ended with his death in February 1925. The election to replace him was held in March and April 1925. After the first ballot did not result in any candidate securing a majority of the votes, the right-wing parties successfully pushed for their first round candidate, Karl Jarres of the German People&#x27;s Party, to be replaced by World War I Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, while the parties of the centre and left united behind Wilhelm Marx of the Centre Party. Hindenburg won a plurality in round two (45%) to become Germany&#x27;s second president. The decision of the Communist Party of Germany to run their candidate, Ernst Thälmann, in the second round was widely considered to have thrown the election to Hindenburg.

Many on the right hoped that once in office Hindenburg would destroy Weimar democracy from the inside, but he governed within the letter of the Weimar Constitution if not always its spirit. In March 1930 he appointed Heinrich Brüning chancellor after Hermann Müller&#x27;s government collapsed. In July, when the Reichstag rejected Brüning&#x27;s budget bill, Hindenburg adopted it by decree and, when the Reichstag reversed the action, he dissolved it. The years that followed saw an explosion of legislation by decree. Hindenburg used Article 48 109 times from 1930 to 1932. The last four cabinets of the Republic (Brüning I and Brüning II, Papen, and Schleicher) are called presidential cabinets because presidential decrees more and more often replaced the Reichstag&#x27;s legislation. Under Brüning, the Social Democrats, out of fear that the Nazi Party would gain strength if there were another election, tolerated the government by not supporting motions that sought to revoke the decrees, but after Franz von Papen became chancellor in 1932, they refused to do so.

Although he was suffering from the onset of senility, Hindenburg stood for re-election in 1932 with the support of the pro-republican parties, who thought that only he could prevent the election of Adolf Hitler. Hindenburg won the election in the second round with 53% of the vote to Hitler&#x27;s 37%. In June he replaced Brüning as chancellor with Franz von Papen and dissolved the Reichstag. Papen hoped that the Nazi Party would win the most seats in the new election and allow him to set up an authoritarian government. In the July election, the Nazis, with 37% of the vote, had the most seats of any party in the Reichstag. By two decrees from Hindenburg, Papen dissolved the newly elected Reichstag and suspended elections beyond the constitutionally mandated 60 days. The Communist Party presented a motion of no confidence in the government, and when it passed Papen again called for a new election. Following the November 1932 election in which the Nazi Party&#x27;s share of the vote slipped to 33%, Papen resigned under pressure from Kurt von Schleicher.

In January 1933, when Schleicher found out that Papen and Hitler were plotting to remove him, he went to Hindenburg to ask for a state of emergency. Hindenburg, out of reluctance to make such a clearly unconstitutional move, refused. With virtually all his support lost, Schleicher resigned on 28 January. Given Germany&#x27;s continued economic and political instability and under pressure from his advisors, President Hindenburg consented to appoint Adolf Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933. Hindenburg dissolved the Reichstag on 1 February, and in the election of March 1933, the Nazi Party won only 44% of the vote. With the aid of the major parties except the SPD and KPD – all of whose members, along with 26 from the SPD, were forcibly kept from the chamber – the Nazis were able to command the two-thirds majority necessary to pass the Enabling Act and amend the constitution with the claim of legality. The act gave the chancellor and his cabinet the power to make and enforce laws without the involvement of the parliament or the president. It effectively brought an end to democracy in the German Reich.

=== Adolf Hitler ===

On 1 August 1934, Hitler&#x27;s government issued the &quot;Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich&quot;, which stated that upon Hindenburg&#x27;s death (which occurred the next day), the offices of president and chancellor would be merged and held by Hitler&quot;.&quot; Hitler from then on styled himself (&quot;Leader and Chancellor&quot;) and did not use the title &quot;Reich President&quot;. The law making him head of state was unconstitutional since it violated Article 2 of the Enabling Act, which stated that &quot;the rights of the President remain unaffected&quot;. Amid widespread fraud and voter intimidation, the law was approved by a popular referendum on 19 August.

In his Final Political Testament written just before he committed suicide on 30 April 1945, Hitler split the two offices he had merged, although the act was unconstitutional under Articles 41 and 51 of the Weimar Constitution, which was technically still in effect. Karl Dönitz, who had been appointed president,&quot;&quot; ordered Germany&#x27;s military (not political) surrender a few days later. He had by then appointed Ludwig von Krosigk as head of government (chancellor), and the two attempted to form a government at Flensburg. It was not recognised by the Allied powers and was dissolved when its members were arrested by British forces on 23 May at Flensburg.

<text>The Parliament of Québec (or Quebec Legislature) (, ) is the legislature of the province of Quebec, Canada. The legislature is made of two elements: the lieutenant governor of Quebec, representing the King of Canada, and the unicameral assembly called the National Assembly of Quebec. The legislature has existed since Canadian Confederation in 1867 when Quebec, then called Canada East, became one of the founding provinces. From 1867 to 1968 the legislature was bicameral, containing a lower chamber called the Legislative Assembly of Quebec and an upper chamber called the Legislative Council of Quebec.

Like the Canadian federal government, Quebec uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which members are elected to the National Assembly after general elections and from there the party with the most seats chooses a premier of Quebec and Executive Council of Quebec. The premier is Quebec&#x27;s head of government, while the King is its head of state. When the party with the most seats has fewer than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties.

Members meet in the Quebec Parliament Building in the provincial capital city of Quebec City.

<doc id="407098" wikidata="Q372254" url="?curid=407098" title="Field (heraldry)">
<text>In heraldry, the background of the shield is called the field. The field is usually composed of one or more tinctures (colours or metals) or furs. The field may be divided or may consist of a variegated pattern.

In rare modern cases, the field or a subdivision thereof is not a tincture but is shown as a scene from a landscape, or, in the case of the 329th Fighter Group of the United States Air Force, blazoned as &quot;the sky proper&quot;. Landscape fields are regarded by many heralds as unheraldic and debased, as they defy the heraldic ideal of simple, boldly-coloured images, and they cannot be consistently drawn from blazon.

The arms of the Inveraray and District Community Council in Scotland have as a field &quot;In waves of the sea&quot;. The correct language of heraldry is very flexible and virtually any image may be blazoned in a correct manner; for example &quot;sky proper&quot; might be blazoned simply &quot;Azure&quot; or &quot;bleu celeste&quot;, whilst &quot;waves of the sea&quot; might be blazoned correctly as &quot;Azure, 3 bars argent&quot; which would provide 3 wavy thick white lines on a blue field.

<doc id="407102" wikidata="Q27028" url="?curid=407102" title="United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights">
<text>The United Nations Prizes in the Field of Human Rights were instituted by United Nations General Assembly in 1966. They are intended to &quot;honour and commend people and organizations which have made an outstanding contribution to the promotion and protection of the human rights embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in other United Nations human rights instruments&quot;.

The UN first awarded the prize to six recipients at a ceremony on 10 December 1968the 20th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the UN has designated Human Rights Day. They have been given out at five-year intervals since then, with the exception of 1983, to individuals, groups and organizations. , 64 awards have been presented, including nine awards presented posthumously (four to recipients who had been murdered while pursuing human rights for others).
The recipients are selected by a committee composed of the presidents of the UN General Assembly, the UN Economic and Social Council and the UN Human Rights Council (which replaced the UN Commission on Human Rights in 2006), and the chairs of the UN Commission on the Status of Women and of the Advisory Committee of the UN Human Rights Council (which replaced the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 2006). Since 1998, the awards are announced by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, which was created a few days after the 1993 ceremony.

The physical token of the award is a metal plaque bearing the UN seal and an artistic design, and engraved with an appropriate citation. In contrast to the Nobel prizeswhose list of prizewinners of the Nobel Peace Prize shares much common ground with the UN Prize in the Field of Human Rightsthe UN&#x27;s awards are non-monetary in nature.

<doc id="407103" wikidata="Q838615" url="?curid=407103" title="Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics">
<text>Football was one of the 154 events at the 1920 Summer Olympics, held in Antwerp, Belgium. It was the fifth time association football was on the Olympic schedule. The tournament expanded to 15 countries, including a non-European nation (Egypt) for the first time.

As these were the first Olympics after World War I, the football teams representing the Central Powers were not invited (Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey). The English Football Association had also withdrawn from FIFA, together with the associations of the other UK Home Nations (Scotland, Ireland and Wales), after their demands that the federations of Germany, Austria and Hungary be expelled from that organisation were rejected: FIFA nevertheless accepted the entry of a team from Great Britain (representing the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), ruling that countries entering the Olympic Games in other sports should not be excluded from the football tournament.

Britain had won the 1908 and 1912 gold medals, but were beaten by Norway 3–1 in the first round: the Norway national football team thus celebrated one of their iconic victories, alongside the elimination of Nazi Germany at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the 1993 win over England in World Cup qualifying, and the 2–1 defeat of reigning world champions Brazil at the 1998 World Cup.

Hosts Belgium won the gold medal, with the final being abandoned in the 39th minute with Belgium leading 2–0 after Czechoslovakia – who participated in an international competition for the first time – walked off to protest the officiating: the Czechslovaks were subsequently ejected from the competition.

As a result of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s ejection and Belgium having received a first-round bye, the beaten quarter-finalists (Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden) faced each other to determine who would play the Netherlands (who were beaten in their semifinal by Belgium), who were now assured of a medal.

The tournament ended with Belgium winning the gold medal, with Spain winning the silver and the Netherlands winning the bronze.

==Venues==

==Squads==
==Tournament==
15 teams entered the competition, which was organized on a knockout basis, but Switzerland withdrew on the morning before the first round due to internal dissent: their opponent, France, was awarded a 2–0 victory.

As such, 12 teams entered the first round, with the winners joining France and Belgium, which were awarded a bye due to their condition as hosts, in the quarter-finals.

Norway defeated Great Britain in the first round, considered by Elo as one of the greatest football upsets of all time.

Czechoslovakia, participating in their first international tournament, made it to the final, beating Kingdom of SCS (who also played their first ever international match in the competition), Norway, and France, while Belgium, after their first-round bye, beat Spain and the Netherlands to qualify for the final.

The final was abandoned in the 39th minute and Belgium were awarded the gold medal after Czechoslovakia walked off to protest the officiating of the English referee, John Lewis, and his linesmen.

A form of the Bergvall System was used to determine the silver and bronze medals: firstly, the beaten quarter-finalists played off, and Spain emerged triumphant, overcoming Sweden 2–1 and Italy 2–0.

Under the original format, Spain would have played off against the teams beaten in the main tournament by gold medalists Belgium, with the winners of these matches playing off for silver and bronze medals. However, Czechoslovakia had been ejected from the competition, and Belgium had received a first-round bye: therefore, the semi-finals were scratched, and Spain advanced to the silver and bronze medal match against the Netherlands, who had been beaten by Belgium in their semi-final. Spain won the match 3–1.

===Exhibition match===
This match was not part of the tournament, but was organized after both teams were eliminated. Some sources erroneously refer to this as an eighth-place match or as part of the silver and bronze medal tournament.

====Gold medal match====

The final was highly controversial, and is the only time as of 2024 that an international final has been abandoned: Belgium were awarded the gold medal after Czechoslovakia walked off the pitch in the 39th minute with Belgium leading 2–0 to protest the officiating after Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner was ejected for assaulting Belgian striker Robert Coppée.

The Czechoslovaks were also deeply dissatisfied with the performance of the 65-year-old English referee, John Lewis, as well as that of the English linesmen, Charles Wreford-Brown and Arthur Knight, who had allowed a contentious second Belgian goal by Henri Larnoe in the 30th minute.

Lewis, Wreford-Brown and Knight had officiated the Belgian semi-final victory over the Netherlands two days earlier, a match observed by the Czechoslovaks (it had taken place on the same day and in the same stadium as their own semi-final victory against France).

The Czechoslovaks immediately protested the result of the final, but their protest was dismissed, and the Czechoslovak team was immediately ejected from the competition.

===Silver and bronze medal tournament=== 
====Repechage bracket====
The original format was based on a form of the Bergvall System: after a knockout tournament between the four teams beaten in the quarter-finals, the winner of that tournament would play off in the semi-finals with the teams beaten in the main tournament by the gold medalists (Belgium), with the winners of these matches playing off for silver and bronze medals.

However, Czechoslovakia had been ejected from the competition, and Belgium had received a first-round bye: therefore, the semi-finals were scratched, and Spain (the winner of the beaten quarter-finalists tournament) advanced to the silver and bronze medal match against the Netherlands (who had been beaten in the semifinals by gold medalists Belgium).

<doc id="407106" wikidata="Q1376982" url="?curid=407106" title="Jim Starlin">
<text>James P. Starlin (born October 9, 1949) is an American comics artist and writer. Beginning his career in the early 1970s, he is best known for space opera stories, for revamping the Marvel Comics characters Captain Marvel and Adam Warlock, and for creating or co-creating the Marvel characters Thanos, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, and Shang-Chi, as well as writing the miniseries &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; and its many sequels including &quot;The Infinity War&quot; and &quot;The Infinity Crusade&quot;, all detailing Thanos&#x27; pursuit of the Infinity Gems to court Mistress Death by annihilating half of all life in the cosmos, before coming into conflict with the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and the Elders of the Universe, joined by the Silver Surfer, Doctor Strange, Gamora, Nebula, and Drax.

Later, for DC Comics, he drew many of their iconic characters, including Darkseid and other characters from Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World, and wrote the seminal storyline &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; which featured the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin, during his run on &quot;Batman&quot;. For &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot;, he created his own character, Dreadstar.

==Early life==
Jim Starlin was born on October 9, 1949, in Detroit, Michigan. He had a Catholic upbringing. In the 1960s, Starlin served as an aviation photographer in the US Navy in Vietnam. During his off duty time, he drew and submitted various comics.

===Early career===
After leaving the navy, Starlin sold two stories to DC Comics.

After writing and drawing stories for a number of fan publications, Jim Starlin entered the comics industry in 1972, working for Roy Thomas and John Romita at Marvel Comics. Starlin was part of the generation of artists and writers who grew up as fans of Silver Age Marvel Comics. At a Steve Ditko-focused panel at the 2008 Comic-Con International, Starlin said, &quot;Everything I learned about storytelling was [due to] him or Kirby. [Ditko] did the best layouts.&quot;

Starlin&#x27;s first job for Marvel was as a finisher on pages of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. He then drew three issues of &quot;Iron Man&quot; which introduced the characters Thanos and Drax the Destroyer. He was then given the chance to draw an issue (#25) of the &quot;cosmic&quot; title &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;. Starlin took over as plotter the following issue, and began developing an elaborate story arc centered on the villainous Thanos which spread across a number of Marvel titles. Starlin left &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; one issue after concluding his Thanos saga.

Concurrently in the mid-1970s, Starlin contributed a cache of stories to the independently published science-fiction anthology &quot;Star Reach&quot;. Here he developed his ideas of God, death, and infinity, free of the restrictions of mainstream comics publishers&#x27; self-censorship arm, the Comics Code Authority. Starlin also drew &quot;The Secret of Skull River&quot;, inked by frequent collaborator Al Milgrom, for &quot;Savage Tales&quot; #5 (July 1974).

After working on &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, Starlin and writer Steve Englehart co-created the character Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu, though they only worked on the early issues of the &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot; series. Starlin then took over the title &quot;Warlock&quot;, starring a genetically engineered being created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the 1960s and re-imagined by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane in the 1970s as a Jesus Christ-like figure on an alternate Earth. Envisioning the character as philosophical and existentially tortured, Starlin wrote and drew a complex space opera with theological and psychological themes. Warlock confronted the militaristic Universal Church of Truth, eventually revealed to be created and led by an evil evolution of his future–past self, known as Magus. Starlin ultimately incorporated Thanos into this story. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;In a brief stint with Marvel, which included work on two characters [Captain Marvel and Adam Warlock] that had previously never quite made their mark, Starlin managed to build a considerable cult following.&quot;

In Fall 1978, Starlin, Howard Chaykin, Walt Simonson, and Val Mayerik formed Upstart Associates, a shared studio space on West 29th Street in New York City. The membership of the studio changed over time.

Death and suicide are recurring themes in Starlin&#x27;s work: Personifications of Death appeared in his Captain Marvel series and in a fill-in story for &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;; Warlock commits suicide by killing his future self; and suicide is a theme in a story he plotted and drew for &quot;The Rampaging Hulk&quot; magazine.

Starlin occasionally worked for Marvel&#x27;s chief competitor DC Comics and drew stories for &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; and the &quot;Batman&quot; feature in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in the late 1970s.

===1980s===
Starlin co-created the supervillain Mongul with writer Len Wein in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #27 (Nov. 1980).

The new decade found Starlin creating an expansive story titled &quot;the Metamorphosis Odyssey&quot;, which introduced the character of Vanth Dreadstar in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; #3. From its beginning in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot;, the initial story was painted in monochromatic grays, eventually added to with other tones, and finally becoming full color. The storyline was further developed in &quot;The Price&quot; and &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #3 and eventually the long-running &quot;Dreadstar&quot; comic book, published first by Epic Comics, and then by First Comics.

Starlin was given the opportunity to produce a one-shot story in which to kill off a main character. &quot;The Death of Captain Marvel&quot; became the first graphic novel published by Marvel itself.

Starlin and Bernie Wrightson produced &quot;Heroes for Hope&quot;, a 1985 one-shot designed to raise money for African famine relief and recovery. Published in the form of a &quot;comic jam,&quot; the book featured an all-star lineup of comics creators as well as a few notable authors from outside the comic book industry, such as Stephen King, George R. R. Martin, Harlan Ellison, and Edward Bryant. In 1986, he and Wrightson produced a second benefit comic for famine relief. &quot;Heroes Against Hunger&quot;, featuring Superman and Batman, was published by DC and like the earlier Marvel benefit project featured many top comics creators.

Starlin became the writer of &quot;Batman,&quot; and one of his first storylines for the title was &quot;Ten Nights of The Beast&quot; in issues #417–420 (March – June 1988) which introduced the KGBeast. Starlin then wrote the four-issue miniseries &quot;&quot; (Aug.–Nov. 1988) drawn by Wrightson, and the storyline &quot;&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #426–429 (Dec. 1988 – Jan. 1989), in which Jason Todd, the second of Batman&#x27;s Robin sidekicks, was killed by the Joker. The controversial storyline was suggested by editor Denny O&#x27;Neil and lined up with Starlin&#x27;s well-known desire to remove the Robin character from Batman&#x27;s storyline. The death was decided by fans, as DC Comics set up a hotline for readers to vote on as to whether or not Jason Todd should survive a potentially fatal situation. Starlin was fired off the &quot;Batman&quot; title soon afterward.

Other projects for DC included writing &quot;The Weird&quot; drawn by Wrightson and &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot; drawn by Mike Mignola. Starlin wrote and drew &quot;Gilgamesh II&quot; in 1989 before returning to Marvel.

===Later career===

Back at Marvel, Starlin began scripting a revival of the &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; series and introduced his creation Thanos into the story, which led to &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; miniseries and its crossover storyline. Here, Starlin brought back Adam Warlock, whom he had killed years earlier in his concluding Warlock story in &quot;The Avengers Annual&quot; #7 and &quot;Marvel Two-in-One Annual&quot; #2 in 1977. &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; proved successful and was followed by the sequel miniseries &quot;The Infinity War&quot; and &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot;.

In 1998, he created &quot;Hardcore Station&quot; in 1998 for DC Comics.

In 2003, Starlin wrote and drew the Marvel Comics miniseries &quot;&quot;. The series starred Thanos and a multitude of Marvel characters, and subsequently, Starlin was assigned an eponymous &quot;Thanos&quot; series. Starlin then worked for independent companies, creating &quot;Cosmic Guard&quot; (later renamed &quot;Kid Cosmos&quot;) published by Devil&#x27;s Due and then Dynamite Entertainment in 2006.

Starlin returned to DC and, with artist Shane Davis, wrote the miniseries &quot;Mystery in Space&quot; vol. 2, featuring Captain Comet and Starlin&#x27;s earlier creation, the Weird. In 2007–2008, he worked on the DC miniseries &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; and &quot;Rann-Thanagar Holy War&quot;, as well as a Hawkman tie-in which altered the character&#x27;s origins. He wrote the eight-issue miniseries &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; in 2009 and in 2013, became the writer of &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, one of the series of The New 52 line, beginning with issue #19.

In 2016, Starlin&#x27;s drawing hand was injured in an accident, which limited him to writing stories without the opportunity to illustrate them. &quot;It takes me two minutes to write the sentence and will take the artist a day and a half to draw the scene. But there is a certain satisfaction to the drawing part … you get up from the drawing board at the end of the day and there’s this image there that wasn’t there before. That’s very satisfying and I miss that.&quot;

In early 2020 it was announced that Starlin had rehabilitated his drawing hand and would be publishing a new Dreadstar graphic novel, &quot;Dreadstar Returns,&quot; backed by a successful Kickstarter campaign. The book was published in June 2021.

In 2024, Starlin announced that he plans to use generative AI technology for future projects, including &quot;Dreadstar vs. Dreadstar&quot;.

<doc id="407109" wikidata="Q1150983" url="?curid=407109" title="One-state solution">
<text>The one-state solution is a proposed approach to the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. It stipulates the establishment of a single state within the boundaries of what was Mandatory Palestine between 1920 and 1948, today consisting of the combined territory of Israel (excluding the annexed Golan Heights) and the State of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza Strip). The term one-state reality describes the belief that the current situation of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict on the ground is that of one country. The one-state solution is sometimes referred to as the bi-national state, owing to the hope that it would successfully deliver self-determination to Israelis and Palestinians in one country, thus granting both peoples independence as well as absolute access to all of the land.

Various models have been proposed for implementing the one-state solution. 

* One such model is the unitary state, which would comprise a single government with citizenship and equal rights for every ethnic and religious group in the land, similar to the legal arrangement of the British Mandate for Palestine. Some Israelis advocate a version of this model in which Israel annexes the West Bank (but not the Gaza Strip) and grants Israeli citizenship to all of the Palestinians living there, thereby integrating the region and gaining a larger Arab minority, but remaining a Jewish and democratic state. 
* A second model calls for Israel to annex the West Bank and integrate it as a Palestinian autonomous region. 
* A third model involves creating a federal state with a central government and federative districts, some of which would be Israeli and others Palestinian. 
* A fourth model, described by the Israeli–Palestinian peace movement A Land for All, involves the establishment of a confederation in which independent Israeli and Palestinian states share powers in some areas, and giving Israelis and Palestinians residency rights in each other&#x27;s states.

Though increasingly debated in academic circles, the one-state solution has remained outside the range of official diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, as it has historically been eclipsed by the two-state solution. According to the most recent joint survey of the Palestinian–Israeli Pulse in 2023, support for a democratic one-state solution stands at 23% among Palestinians and 20% among Israeli Jews. A non-equal non-democratic one-state solution remains more popular among both populations, supported by 30% of Palestinians and 37% of Israeli Jews. A Palestinian poll in September 2024 revealed that only 10% of respondents supported a single state that would provide equal rights for both Israelis and Palestinians.

==Overview==

The &quot;one-state solution&quot; refers to a resolution of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through the creation of a unitary, federal or confederate Israeli-Palestinian state, which would encompass all of the present territory of Israel, the West Bank including East Jerusalem, and possibly the Gaza Strip and Golan Heights. Depending on various points of view, a one-state solution is presented as a situation in which Israel would ostensibly lose its character as a Jewish state and the Palestinians would fail to achieve their national independence within a two-state solution, or as the best, most just, and only way to resolve the conflict.

==Historical background==
===Antiquity until World War I===

The area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River has been controlled by various national groups throughout history. A number of groups, including the Canaanites, the Israelites (who later became the Jews), the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Jews, Romans, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Seljuk Turks, Crusaders, Mamluks, Ottomans, the British, Israelis, Jordanians, and Egyptians have controlled the region at one time or another. From 1516 until the end of World War I, the region was controlled by the Ottoman Empire.

===Ottoman and later British control===
From 1915 to 1916, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon, corresponded by letters with Sayyid Hussein bin Ali, the father of Pan Arabism. These letters were later known as the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence. McMahon promised Hussein and his Arab followers the territory of the Ottoman Empire in exchange for assistance in driving out the Ottoman Turks. Hussein interpreted these letters as promising the region of Palestine to the Arabs. McMahon and the Churchill White Paper maintained that Palestine had been excluded from the territorial promises, but minutes of a Cabinet Eastern Committee meeting held on 5 December 1918 confirmed that Palestine had been part of the area that had been pledged to Hussein in 1915.

In 1916, Britain and France signed the Sykes–Picot Agreement, which divided the colonies of the Ottoman Empire between them. Under this agreement, the region of Palestine would be controlled by Britain. In a 1917 letter from Arthur James Balfour to Lord Rothschild, known as the Balfour Declaration, the British government promised &quot;the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people&quot;, but at the same time required &quot;that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine&quot;.

In 1922, the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate for Palestine. Like all League of Nations Mandates, this mandate derived from article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, which called for the self-determination of former Ottoman Empire colonies after a transitory period administered by a world power. The Palestine Mandate recognized the Balfour Declaration and required that the mandatory government &quot;facilitate Jewish immigration&quot; while at the same time &quot;ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced&quot;.

Resentment over Zionist plans led to an outbreak of Arab-Jewish violence in the Palestine Riots of 1920. Violence erupted again the following year during the Jaffa Riots. In response to these riots, Britain established the Haycraft Commission of Inquiry. The British Mandatory authorities put forward proposals for setting up an elected legislative council in Palestine. In 1924 the issue was raised at a conference held by Ahdut Ha&#x27;avodah at Ein Harod. Shlomo Kaplansky, a veteran leader of Poalei Zion, argued that a Parliament, even with an Arab majority, was the way forward. David Ben-Gurion, the emerging leader of the Yishuv, succeeded in getting Kaplansky&#x27;s ideas rejected. Violence erupted again in the form of the 1929 Palestine riots. After the violence, the British led another commission of inquiry under Sir Walter Shaw. The report of the Shaw Commission, known as the Shaw Report or Command Paper No 3530, attributed the violence to &quot;the twofold fear of the Arabs that, by Jewish immigration and land purchase, they might be deprived of their livelihood and, in time, pass under the political domination of the Jews&quot;.
Violence erupted again during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine. The British established the Peel Commission of 1936–1937 in order to put an end to the violence. The Peel Commission concluded that only partition could put an end to the violence, and proposed the Peel Partition Plan. While the Jewish community accepted the concept of partition, not all members endorsed the implementation proposed by the Peel Commission. The Arab community entirely rejected the Peel Partition Plan, which included population transfers, primarily of Arabs. The partition plan was abandoned, and in 1939 Britain issued its White Paper of 1939 clarifying its &quot;unequivocal&quot; position that &quot;it is not part of [Britain&#x27;s] policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State&quot; and that &quot;The independent State [of Palestine] should be one in which Arabs and Jews share government in such a way as to ensure that the essential interests of each community are safeguarded.&quot;

The White Paper of 1939 sought to accommodate Arab demands regarding Jewish immigration by placing a quota of 10,000 Jewish immigrants per year over a five-year period from 1939 to 1944. It also required Arab consent for further Jewish immigration. The White Paper was seen by the Jewish community as a revocation of the Balfour Declaration, and due to Jewish persecution in the Holocaust, Jews continued to immigrate illegally in what has become known as Aliyah Bet.

Continued violence and the heavy cost of World War II prompted Britain to turn over the issue of Palestine to the United Nations in 1947. In its debates, the UN divided its member States into two subcommittees: one to address options for partition and a second to address all other options. The Second Subcommittee, which included all the Arab and Muslim States members, issued a long report arguing that partition was illegal according to the terms of the Mandate and proposing a unitary democratic state that would protect rights of all citizens equally. The General Assembly instead voted for partition and in UN General Assembly Resolution 181 recommended that the Mandate territory of Palestine be partitioned into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The Jewish community accepted the 1947 partition plan, and declared independence as the State of Israel in 1948. The Arab community rejected the partition plan, and army units from five Arab countries – Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Transjordan, and Egypt – contributed to a united Arab army that attempted to invade the territory, resulting in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

===Establishment of Israel===
The 1948 Arab–Israeli War resulted in Israel&#x27;s establishment as well as the flight or expulsion of over 700,000 Palestinians from the territory that became Israel. During the following years, a large population of Jews living in Arab nations (close to 800,000) left or were expelled from their homes in what has become known as the Modern Jewish Exodus and subsequently resettled in the new State of Israel.

By 1948, in the wake of the Holocaust, Jewish support for partition and a Jewish state had become overwhelming. Nevertheless, some Jewish voices still argued for unification. The International Jewish Labor Bund was against the UN vote on the partition of Palestine and reaffirmed its support for a single binational state that would guarantee equal national rights for Jews and Arabs and would be under the control of superpowers and the UN. The 1948 New York Second world conference of the International Jewish Labor Bund condemned the proclamation of the Jewish state, because the decision exposed the Jews in Palestine to danger. The conference was in favour of a binational state built on the base of national equality and democratic federalism.

A one-state, one-nation solution where Arabic-speaking Palestinians would adopt a Hebrew-speaking Israeli identity (although not necessarily the Jewish religion) was advocated within Israel by the Canaanite movement of the 1940s and 1950s, as well as more recently in the Engagement Movement led by Tsvi Misinai.

===Palestinian views on a binational state===
Prior to the 1960s, no solution to the conflict in which Arabs and Jews would share a binational state was accepted among Palestinians. The only viable solution from the Palestinian point of view would be an Arab state in which European immigrants would have second-class status. The Palestinian position evolved following Israel&#x27;s victory in the Six-Day War, when it became no longer realistic to expect the militarily powerful and densely populated Jewish state to disappear. Eventually, Palestinian leadership committed to the idea of a two-state solution. But according to a poll taken by the Palestine Center for Public Opinion in 2020, around 10% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza believe that working towards a binational state should be a top priority.

==One-state debate since 2009==
A poll conducted in 2010 by Israel Democracy Institute suggested that 15% of right-wing Jewish Israelis and 16% of left-wing Jewish Israelis support a binational state solution over a two states solution based on 1967 lines. According to the same poll, 66% of Jewish Israelis preferred the two-state solution.

Some Israeli government spokespeople have also proposed that Palestinian-majority areas of Israel, such as the area around Umm el-Fahm, be annexed to the new Palestinian state. As this measure would cut these areas off permanently from the rest of Israel&#x27;s territory, including the coastal cities and other Palestinian towns and villages, Palestinians view this with alarm. Many Palestinian citizens of Israel would therefore prefer a one-state solution because this would allow them to sustain their Israeli citizenship.

Some Israeli Jews and Palestinians who oppose a one-state solution have nevertheless come to believe that it may come to pass. Israeli Prime Minister Olmert argued, in a 2007 interview with the Israeli daily &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;, that without a two-state agreement Israel would face &quot;a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights&quot; in which case &quot;Israel [would be] finished&quot;. This echoes comments made in 2004 by Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei, who said that if Israel failed to conclude an agreement with the Palestinians, that the Palestinians would pursue a single, bi-national state. In November 2009, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat proposed the adoption of the one-state solution if Israel did not halt settlement construction: &quot;[Palestinians must] refocus their attention on the one-state solution where Muslims, Christians and Jews can live as equals. ... It is very serious. This is the moment of truth for us.&quot;

Support for a one-state solution is increasing as Palestinians, frustrated by lack of progress in negotiations aiming to establish the two-state solution, increasingly see the one-state solution as an alternative way forward. In 2016, then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said that due to expanding settlements, an eventual &quot;one-state reality&quot; was the most likely outcome.

In a 2021 survey of experts on the Middle East, 59 percent described the current situation as &quot;a one-state reality akin to apartheid&quot; and an additional 7 percent &quot;one-state reality with inequality, but not akin to apartheid&quot;. If a two-state solution is not achieved, 77 percent predict &quot;a one-state reality akin to apartheid&quot; and 17 percent &quot;one-state reality with increasing inequality, but not akin to apartheid&quot;; just 1 percent think a binational state with equal rights for all inhabitants is likely. 52 percent say that the two-state solution is no longer possible.

==Arguments for and against==
===In favor===
Today, the proponents for the one-state solution include Palestinian author Ali Abunimah, Palestinian writer and political scientist Abdalhadi Alijla, Palestinian-American producer Jamal Dajani, Palestinian lawyer Michael Tarazi, American-Israeli anthropologist Jeff Halper, Israeli writer Dan Gavron, Lebanese-American academic Saree Makdisi, and Israeli journalist Gideon Levy. In an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2004, Tarazi opined that the expansion of the Israeli settler movement, especially in the West Bank, was a rationale for bi-nationalism and the increased infeasibility of the two-state alternative: &quot;Support for one state is hardly a radical idea; it is simply the recognition of the uncomfortable reality that Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories already function as a single state. They share the same aquifers, the same highway network, the same electricity grid and the same international borders... The one-state solution... neither destroys the Jewish character of the Holy Land nor negates the Jewish historical and religious attachment (although it would destroy the superior status of Jews in that state). Rather, it affirms that the Holy Land has an equal Christian and Muslim character. For those who believe in equality, this is a good thing.&quot; Advocates of this solution push for a secular and democratic state while still maintaining a Jewish presence and culture in the region. They concede that this alternative will erode the dream of Jewish supremacy in terms of governance in the long run.

Hamas has at times ruled out a two-state solution, and at other times endorsed the possibility of a two-state solution. Hamas co-founder Mahmoud Al-Zahar has been cited saying he &quot;did not rule out the possibility of having Jews, Muslims and Christians living under the sovereignty of an Islamic state.&quot; The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, for its part, rejects a two-state solution; its leader Khalid al-Batsh stated that &quot;The idea cannot be accepted and we believe that the entire Palestine is Arab and Islamic land and belongs to the Palestinian nation.&quot;

In 2003, Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi proposed a one-state solution known as the &quot;Isratin&quot; proposal. Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei and former president Ebrahim Raisi both expressed their support for a one-state solution, in which Palestine would become the sole legitimate government of Israel.

====The left====
Since 1999, interest has been renewed in bi-nationalism or a unitary democratic state. That year, Palestinian activist Edward Said wrote, &quot;[A]fter 50 years of Israeli history, classic Zionism has provided no solution to the Palestinian presence. I therefore see no other way than to begin now to speak about sharing the land that has thrust us together, sharing it in a truly democratic way with equal rights for all citizens.&quot;

In October 2003, New York University scholar Tony Judt broke ground in his article, &quot;Israel: The Alternative&quot; in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, in which he argued that Israel is an &quot;anachronism&quot; in sustaining an ethnic identity for the state and that the two-state solution is fundamentally doomed and unworkable. The Judt article engendered considerable debate in the UK and the US, and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; received more than 1,000 letters per week about the essay. A month later, political scientist Virginia Tilley published &quot;The One-State Solution&quot; in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; (followed by a book with the same title in 2005), arguing that West Bank settlements had made a two-state solution impossible and that the international community must accept a one-state solution as the &quot;de facto&quot; reality.

Leftist journalists from Israel, such as Haim Hanegbi and Daniel Gavron, have called for the public to &quot;face the facts&quot; and accept the binational solution. On the Palestinian side, similar voices have been raised. Then-Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert argued, in a 2007 interview with the Israeli daily &quot;Haaretz&quot;, that without a two-state agreement Israel would face &quot;a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights&quot; in which case &quot;Israel [would be] finished&quot;.

John Mearsheimer, co-director of the Programme on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, says the binational solution has become inevitable. He further argued that by allowing Israel&#x27;s settlements to prevent the formation of a Palestinian state, the United States has helped Israel commit &quot;national suicide&quot; since Palestinians will be the majority group in the binational state.

Rashid Khalidi wrote in 2011 that the one-state solution was already a reality, in that &quot;there is only one state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, in which there are two or three levels of citizenship or non-citizenship within the borders of that one state that exerts total control.&quot; Khalidi further argued that the &quot;peace process&quot; had been extinguished by ongoing Israeli settlement construction, and anyone who still believed it could result in an equitable two-state solution should have their &quot;head examined&quot;.

In 2013, professor Ian Lustick wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the &quot;fantasy&quot; of a two-state solution prevented people from working on solutions that might really work. Lustick argued that people who assume Israel will persist as a Zionist project should consider how quickly the Soviet, Pahlavi Iranian, apartheid South African, Baathist Iraqi and Yugoslavian states unraveled. Lustick concludes that while it may not arise without &quot;painful stalemates&quot;, a one-state solution may be a way to eventual Palestinian independence.

====The Israeli right====
In recent years, some politicians and political commentators representing the right wing of Israeli politics have advocated annexing the West Bank, and granting the West Bank&#x27;s Palestinian population Israeli citizenship while maintaining Israel&#x27;s current status as a Jewish state with recognized minorities. Proposals from the Israeli right for a one-state solution tend to avoid advocating the annexation of the Gaza Strip, due to its large and generally hostile Palestinian population and its status as a self-governing territory without any Israeli settlements or permanent military presence. Some Israeli politicians, including former defense minister Moshe Arens, and former President Reuven Rivlin and Uri Ariel have voiced support for a one-state solution, rather than divide the West Bank in a two-state solution. 

In 2013, Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely argued that Jordan was originally created as the Arab state in the British Mandate of Palestine and that Israel should annex the West Bank as a historic part of the Land of Israel. Naftali Bennett, Prime Minister of Israel, included in many Likud-led coalitions, argues for the annexation of Zone C of the West Bank. Zone C, agreed upon as part of the Oslo Accords, comprises about 60% of West Bank land and is currently under Israeli military control.

In the 2014 book &quot;The Israeli Solution&quot;, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; columnist Caroline Glick challenged the census statistics provided by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and argued that the bureau had vastly over-inflated the Palestinian population of the West Bank by 1.34 million and that PCBS statistics and predictions are unreliable. According to a Begin–Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (BESA) study, the 2004 Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza stood at 2.5 million and not the 3.8 million claimed by the Palestinians. According to Glick, the 1997 PCBS survey, used as the basis for later studies, inflated numbers by including over three hundred thousand Palestinians living abroad and by double-counting over two hundred thousand Jerusalem Arabs already included in Israel&#x27;s population survey. Further, Glick says later PCBS surveys reflect the predictions of the 1997 PCBS survey, reporting unrealized birth forecasts, including assumptions of large Palestinian immigration that never occurred.

Based on this study, Glick argued that annexation of the West Bank would only add 1.4 million Palestinians to the population of Israel. She argued that a one-state solution with a Jewish majority and a political system rooted in Jewish values was the best way to guarantee the protection of democratic values and the rights of all minorities.

The demographic statistics from the PCBS are backed by Arnon Soffer and quite similar to official Israeli figures. Sergio DellaPergola gives a figure of 5,698,500 Arabs living in Israel and the Palestinian territories in 2015, while the core Jewish population stood at 6,103,200.

===Against===
Critics argue that it would make Israeli Jews an ethnic minority in the only Jewish country. The high total fertility rate among Palestinians accompanied by a return of Palestinian refugees, would quickly render Jews a minority, according to Sergio DellaPergola, an Israeli demographer and statistician.

Critics have also argued that Jews, like any other nation, have the right to self-determination, and that due to still existing antisemitism, there is a need for a Jewish national home.

The Reut Institute expands on these concerns of many Israeli Jews and says that a one-state scenario without any institutional safeguards would negate Israel&#x27;s status as a homeland for the Jewish people. When proposed as a political solution by non-Israelis, the assumption is that the idea is probably being put forward by those who are politically motivated to harm Israel and, by extension, Israeli Jews. They argue that the absorption of millions of Palestinians, along with a right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the generally high birthrate among Palestinians would quickly render Jews an ethnic minority and eliminate their rights to self-determination.

Israeli historian and politician Shlomo Ben-Ami, who served as Foreign Minister of Israel, dismissed the one-state solution as &quot;ivory tower nonsense&quot; and said that it creates a &quot;South Africa situation without a South Africa solution.&quot;

In an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, Hussein Ibish claimed that it is not realistic for Israel to be compelled to accept a binational solution with full right of return for refugees through international pressure or sanctions. According to Ibish, if a one state solution was to happen, it would come as a result of the status quo continuing, and the end result would be a protracted civil war, with each intifada more violent than the last, and the conflict growing more and more religious in nature. Ibish speculated that in such a scenario, it could even go beyond an ethno-national war between Israelis and Palestinians into a religious war between Jews and Muslims, with Israeli Jews ending up under siege and relying on their nuclear weapons for protection.

====Academia====
New Historian Benny Morris has argued that the one-state solution is not viable because of Arab unwillingness to accept a Jewish national presence in the Middle East. Morris argues any such state would be an authoritarian, fundamentalist state with a persecuted Jewish minority, citing the racism and persecution minorities face throughout the Arab and Muslim world, and writing that &quot;Western liberals [...] refuse to recognize that peoples, for good historical, cultural, and social reasons are different and behave differently in similar or identical sets of circumstances.&quot; He notes the differences between Israeli Jewish society, which remains largely Westernized and secular, and Palestinian society, which according to Morris is increasingly Islamic and fundamentalist. He pointed to Hamas&#x27; 2007 takeover of Gaza, during which Fatah prisoners were shot in the knees and thrown off buildings, and the regular honor killings of women that permeate Palestinian and Israeli-Arab society, as evidence that Palestinian Muslims have no respect for Western values. He thus claimed that &quot;the mindset and basic values of Israeli Jewish society and Palestinian Muslim society are so different and mutually exclusive as to render a vision of binational statehood tenable only in the most disconnected and unrealistic of minds.&quot;

According to Morris, the goal of a &quot;secular democratic Palestine&quot; was invented to appeal to Westerners, and while a few supporters of the one-state solution may honestly believe in such an outcome, the realities of Palestinian society mean that &quot;the phrase objectively serves merely as camouflage for the goal of a Muslim Arab–dominated polity to replace Israel.&quot; Morris argued that should a binational state ever emerge, many Israeli Jews would likely emigrate to escape the &quot;stifling darkness, intolerance, authoritarianism, and insularity of the Arab world and its treatment of minority populations&quot;, with only those incapable of finding new host countries to resettle in and Ultra-Orthodox Jews remaining behind.

Some argue that Jews would face the threat of genocide. Writing on &quot;Arutz Sheva&quot;, Steven Plaut referred to the one-state solution as the &quot;Rwanda Solution&quot;, and wrote that the implementation of a one-state solution in which a Palestinian majority would rule over a Jewish minority would eventually lead to a &quot;new Holocaust&quot;. Morris argued that while the Palestinians would have few moral inhibitions over the destruction of Israeli-Jewish society through mass murder or expulsion, fear of international intervention would probably stymie such an outcome.

Some critics argue that unification cannot happen without damaging or destroying Israel&#x27;s democracy. The vast majority of Israeli Jews as well as Israeli Druze, some Israeli Bedouin, many Israeli Christian Arabs and even some non-Bedouin Israeli Muslim Arabs fear the consequences of amalgamation with the mostly Muslim Palestinian population in the occupied territories, which they perceive as more religious and conservative. (All Israeli Druze men and small numbers of Bedouin men serve in the Israel Defense Forces and there are sometimes rifts between these groups and Palestinians). One poll found that, in a future Palestinian state, 23% of Palestinians want civil law only, 35% want both Islamic and civil law, and 38% want Islamic law only. This negative view of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza prompts some critics to argue that the existing level of rights and equality for all Israeli citizens would be put in jeopardy with unification. Benny Morris echoes these claims, arguing that Palestinian Muslims, who would become the ruling majority in any such state, are deeply religious and do not have any tradition of democratic governance.

In response to the common argument given by proponents of the one state solution that Israel&#x27;s settlements have become so entrenched in the West Bank that a Palestinian state is effectively impossible, scholars such as Norman Finkelstein and Noam Chomsky have countered that it is far more unrealistic to expect Israel to accept a one-state solution that would spell the end of Zionism than it is to expect it to dismantle some settlements. Nathan Thrall has argued that Israel could implement a unilateral withdrawal at any time of its choosing and that the facts on the ground suggest that a single state is a remote possibility, writing that:
Shaul Arieli has likewise argued that the settlement enterprise has failed to create the appropriate conditions to prevent a contiguous Palestinian state or to implement the annexation of the West Bank. He has noted that the settlers comprise only 13.5% of the West Bank&#x27;s population and occupy 4% of its land, and that the settlement enterprise has failed to build up a viable local economic infrastructure. He noted that only about 400 settler households were engaged in agriculture, with the amount of settler-owned farmland comprising only 1.5% of the West Bank. In addition, he wrote that there are only two significant industrial zones in the West Bank settlements, with the vast majority of workers there Palestinian, and that the vast majority of settlers live near the border, in areas that can be annexed by Israel with relative ease in territorial exchanges, while still allowing for the formation of a viable Palestinian state. According to Arieli, 62% of the settler workforce commutes over the Green Line into Israel proper for work while another 25% works in the heavily subsidized education system of the settlements, with only a small percent working in agriculture and industry. About half of the settlements have populations fewer than 1,000 and only 15 have populations greater than 5,000. According to Arieli, the settlement movement has failed to create facts on the ground precluding an Israeli withdrawal, and it is possible to implement a land exchange that would see about 80% of the settlers stay in place, necessitating the evacuation of only about 30,000 settler households, in order to establish a viable and contiguous Palestinian state in the West Bank.

This sentiment has been echoed by Shany Mor, who argued that in 2020, the geographical distribution of settlers in the West Bank had not materially changed since 1993, and that a two-state solution is actually more feasible now than it was in the past due to the disentanglement of the Israeli and Palestinian economies in the 1990s. According to Mor, nearly all the population growth in the settlements between 2005 and 2020 was concentrated in the Haredi settlements of Beitar Illit and Modi&#x27;in Illit, due to their high birth rates.

====Journalists====
One major argument against the one-state solution is that it would endanger the safety of the Jewish minority, because it would require assimilation with what critics fear would be an extremely hostile Muslim ruling majority. In particular, Jeffrey Goldberg points to a 2000 &quot;Haaretz&quot; interview with Edward Said, whom he describes as &quot;one of the intellectual fathers of one-statism&quot;. When asked whether he thought a Jewish minority would be treated fairly in a binational state, Said replied that &quot;it worries me a great deal. The question of what is going to be the fate of the Jews is very difficult for me. I really don&#x27;t know.&quot;

Imagining what might ensue with unification, some critics of the one-state model believe that rather than ending the Arab–Israeli conflict, it would result in large-scale ethnic violence and possibly civil war, pointing to violence during the British Mandate period, such as in 1920, 1921, 1929, and 1936–39 as examples. In this view, violence between Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews is inevitable and can only be forestalled by partition. These critics also cite the 1937 Peel Commission, which recommended partition as the only means of ending the conflict. Critics also cite bi-national arrangements in Yugoslavia, Lebanon, Bosnia, Cyprus, and Pakistan, which failed and resulted in further internal conflicts. Similar criticisms appear in &quot;The Case for Peace&quot;.

Left-wing Israeli journalist Amos Elon argued that while Israel&#x27;s settlement policy was pushing things in the direction of a one-state solution, should it ever come to pass, &quot;the end result is more likely to resemble Zimbabwe than post-apartheid South Africa&quot;. Echoing these sentiments, Palestinian-American journalist Ray Hanania wrote that the idea of a single state where Jews, Muslims, and Christians can live side by side is &quot;fundamentally flawed.&quot; In addition to the fact that Israel would not support it, Hanania noted that the Arab and Muslim world don&#x27;t practice it, writing &quot;Exactly where do Jews and Christians live in the Islamic World today side-by-side with equality? We don&#x27;t even live side-by-side with equality in the Palestinian Diaspora.&quot;

On the aftermath of any hypothetical implementation of a one-state solution, Gershom Gorenberg wrote: &quot;Palestinians will demand the return of property lost in 1948 and perhaps the rebuilding of destroyed villages. Except for the drawing of borders, virtually every question that bedevils Israeli–Palestinian peace negotiations will become a domestic problem setting the new political entity aflame... Two nationalities who have desperately sought a political frame for cultural and social independence would wrestle over control of language, art, street names, and schools.&quot; Gorenberg wrote that in the best case, the new state would be paralyzed by endless arguments, and in the worst case, constant disagreements would erupt into violence.

Gorenberg wrote that in addition to many of the problems with the one-state solution described above, the hypothetical state would collapse economically, as the Israeli Jewish intelligentsia would in all likelihood emigrate, writing that &quot;financing development in majority-Palestinian areas and bringing Palestinians into Israel&#x27;s social welfare network would require Jews to pay higher taxes or receive fewer services. But the engine of the Israeli economy is high-tech, an entirely portable industry. Both individuals and companies will leave.&quot; As a result, the new binational state would be financially crippled.

==Public opinion==

A multi-option poll by Near East Consulting (NEC) in November 2007 found the bi-national state to be less popular than either &quot;two states for two people&quot; or &quot;a Palestinian state on all historic Palestine&quot; with only 13.4% of respondents supporting a binational solution. However, in February 2007, NEC found that around 70% of Palestinian respondents backed the idea when given a straight choice of either supporting or opposing &quot;a one-state solution in historic Palestine where Muslims, Christians and Jews have equal rights and responsibilities&quot;.

In March 2010, a survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem found that Palestinian support had risen to 29 percent.

In April 2010, a poll by the Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre also found that Palestinian support for a &quot;bi-national&quot; solution had jumped from 20.6 percent in June 2009 to 33.8 percent. If this support for a bi-national state is combined with the finding that 9.8 percent of Palestinian respondents favour a &quot;Palestinian state&quot; in &quot;all of historic Palestine&quot;, this poll suggested about equal Palestinian support for a two-state and one-state solution in mid-2010.

In 2011, a poll by Stanley Greenberg and the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion and sponsored by the Israel Project revealed that 61% of Palestinians reject a two state solution, while 34% said they accepted it. 66% said the Palestinians’ real goal should be to start with a two-state solution but then move to it all being one Palestinian state.

==Views of current situation==
In a 2021 survey of experts on the Middle East, 59 percent described the current situation as &quot;a one-state reality akin to apartheid&quot;.

<text>Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics was the sixth edition of the football tournament at the Summer Olympic Games held in Paris.

The tournament expanded to 22 countries from four confederations for the first time, with African side Egypt (as was the case in the previous edition), Turkey which is partly in Asia, Uruguay representing South America and the United States representing North America.

Uruguay made a memorable debut, going undefeated and winning the gold medal. This earned them the first of the four stars above their crest.

==Venues==
==Amateur status==
In 1921, the Belgium Football Association first allowed for payments to players for time lost from work; in the months that followed four other Associations (Switzerland and Italy amongst them) permitted similar subsidies. The Football Association, perhaps with foresight, considered their statement of 1884 to be one which FIFA should hereafter follow. They had stated: &quot;Any player registered with this Association ... receiving remuneration ... of any sort above ... necessary expenses actually paid, shall be considered to be a professional.&quot;

In 1923 the four British Associations sought an assurance that FIFA accept this definition; the four FIFA representatives on the International Football Association Board refused and, consequently, both the United Kingdom and Denmark withdrew their footballers from representing their nations at the 1924 Olympic Games.

== Entries ==

In &quot;Association Football&quot; (1960), Bernard Joy wrote about the 1912 Games that the authorities in Sweden &quot;had debated for a long time whether to include football ... because its popularity was not yet world wide&quot;. Twelve years later, in Paris, football had become so important to the Games that a 1/3 of the income generated came from football. In terms of international development these Games signalled the first participation in a major Championship of a team from South America, a continent which would provide the main competition to Europe from that moment on.
In Paris, Uruguay, who had paid their third class passage to Paris and gone on a successful tour of Spain beforehand, would join as many as 18 European teams; the United States, Turkey and Egypt.

The Uruguayans had won the 1923 Sudamericano by maximum points in the December of the previous year to qualify for the tournament as their continent&#x27;s sole participants; defeating rivals Argentina 2–0 in the final game in which Pedro Petrone scored halfway through the first half. Joy wrote: &quot;&quot;A doctor and a physical expert were as important elements of the staff as the coach himself. They saw to it that their charges reached perfect physical condition. They were kept that way by staying away from the attractions of Paris at a villa in the quiet village of Argenteuil&quot;.&quot; In Paris Jose Leandro Andrade would be dubbed &quot;La Merveille Noire&quot;. Despite this little was known about them; they had never played outside South America and their international experience had mainly been spent travelling across the harbour from Buenos Aires to Montevideo.

Italy, having remained unbeaten since 1922, found themselves beaten 4–0 by an early incantation of Hugo Meisl&#x27;s Wunderteam (who would absent themselves from the Games).
With just six weeks to go before the Games Italy had been walloped 7–1 by Hungary). Other than dropping Giampiero Combi, Vittorio Pozzo would not make major changes; Italy would not prevail. The same policy was adopted by Kingdom of SCS. Rather than considering dropping players, they had sacked their manager Veljko Ugrinić instead (following a 4–1 defeat by those Austrians in Zagreb) but would find his replacement Todor Sekulić just as hapless.

The Hungarians had just come off a good run of results in the previous year, but had been beaten by the Swiss in the days leading up to the Games; Max Abegglen, who had only been playing international football for two years, scoring his 7th international goal that day for the Swiss. The Swiss had been on the verge of withdrawing from the Games due to their continued success. The team&#x27;s train ticket was valid for only 10 days and their money had run out. An appeal by a newspaper, &quot;Sport&quot;, brought in the needed funds.

Entering for the second time Egypt caused a surprise defeat in their opening game. Both finalists from the previous Games were present; Belgium being afforded a bye into the first round; the Czechs drawn against Turkey in the preliminary round.

== Final tournament ==

The Games competition was assisted by a Preliminary Round which featured the silver-medallists from the 1920 Games, Spain in a game with Italy. Since that time Spain had only lost once and that by a single goal away to Belgium and had drawn 0–0 with the Italians in March 1924. There was hardly anything between themselves and Italy when they met, this time, at the Colombes Stadium; Pedro Vallana&#x27;s own goal handing victory to Italy.

Hungary put five past Poland, the Swiss sent Lithuania on their way, 9–0. The Uruguayans &quot;played first-rate football, combining speed, skill and perfect ball-control. By marrying short passing to intelligent positional play, they made the ball do all the work, and so kept their opponents on the run&quot; wrote Joy. The Uruguayans sailed past Kingdom of SCS by seven clear goals, then overcame the United States by three goals to nil.
In the first round Czechoslovakia (following their decision to walk off the field in 1920) faced Switzerland and the game went into extra-time. One Czech was sent off, and the Norwegian referee had to call for order during a break. For the replay, Abegllen took the captain&#x27;s duties and all was different; Switzerland winning by the single goal. Otherwise there were two surprises, the first went Egypt&#x27;s way; 3–0 to the good against Hungary. The second saw Sweden defeat the reigning gold-medallists, Belgium 8–1. Oscar Verbeeck&#x27;s own goal set the Swedes on their way; Sven Rydell&#x27;s hat-trick the feature of the match. The Swedish outside-left Rudolf Kock (who would become chairman of the selectors in 1948 working alongside George Raynor), would have another fine game against Egypt where Sweden won 5–0. France and Holland had been similarly dominant in the first round, but Uruguay beat France 5–1 to claim a semi-final place.
In another quarter-final Italy went out to Switzerland disputing a winner by Max Abegglen, who converted a break-away goal. The Italians protested that he had been off-side. The referee Johannes Mutters, refused to alter the decision of his linesman; a jury upheld the judgement. There was further dispute in the semi-final where Holland (coached by the former Blackburn Rovers&#x27; player William Townley) took a first half lead against Uruguay through Feyenoord&#x27;s Kees Pijl. With twenty minutes to go Pedro Cea scored an equaliser and with less than ten Georges Vallat, the French referee, awarded Uruguay a penalty. FIFA reported that &quot;the Netherlands protested the ruling of a penalty kick that turned out to be the winning goal but then Uruguay protested against the Olympic Committee&#x27;s selection of a Dutch referee for the final. To appease the South Americans, the committee pulled the name of a final referee out of a hat and picked out a Frenchman, Marcel Slawick&quot;. In the other semi-final between Switzerland and Sweden the Swiss prevailed.

In the final the Swiss were defeated by the Uruguayans whose two goals in the second half put paid to their opponent&#x27;s ambitions, Uruguay eventually prevailing 3–0. Interest in the final had been considerable, such was the draw of the Uruguayan side; 60,000 watched and 10,000 were locked out.

==Trivia==
* Sweden won the bronze medal. Their 8-1 defeat of the reigning champions, Belgium, in the opening round is still considered one of the biggest upsets in World football by criteria laid down by ELO.
* Some of the games took place at the Vélodrome de Vincennes.
* The lap of honour (or previously called &quot;Olympic turn&quot;), the celebration ritual that a champion team does after winning a tournament, was invented by the Uruguayan team after winning this Olympic title, as they wanted to salute those in attendance by running all around the athletics field.
* Uruguay&#x27;s Pedro Petrone was two days shy of his 19th birthday when he accepted his gold medal; he is still the youngest football gold-medalist in the history of the Games.
* Future Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was a worker in France at the time, in order to watch the final he pawned his coat. He mentioned his experience on this during an interview after his retirement.
