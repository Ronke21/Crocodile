<text>The Famous Five (), also known as The Valiant Five, and initially as The Alberta Five, were five prominent Canadian suffragists who advocated for women and children: Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, Emily Murphy, and Irene Parlby. On August 27, 1927, they petitioned the federal government to refer the issue of the eligibility of women to be senator to the Supreme Court of Canada. This petition was the foundation of the &quot;Persons Case,&quot; a leading constitutional decision. Although most Canadian women had the vote in federal elections and all provinces but Quebec by 1927, the case was part of a larger drive for political equality. This was the first step towards equality for women in Canada and was the start to the first wave of feminism.

The question the federal government posed to the Supreme Court was: &quot;Does the word &#x27;Persons&#x27; in Section 24 of the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;, include female persons?&quot; In 1928, the Supreme Court unanimously held that women were not &quot;qualified persons&quot; within the meaning of s. 24 of the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;. The five women appealed that ruling to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court of appeal in the British Empire. On October 18, 1929, the Judicial Committee overruled the Supreme Court and held that women were &quot;qualified persons&quot; and eligible to be appointed to the Senate.

Some saw this as &quot;radical change&quot;; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the 1689 Bill of Rights, which uses only the term &quot;person&quot;, not the term &quot;man&quot; (or &quot;woman&quot; for that matter). Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the Canadian constitution, an approach that has come to be known as the &quot;living tree doctrine&quot;.

==The Five==

The women of the Famous Five included Emily Murphy, Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, and Irene Parlby. These five women represent iconic powerful movements and change within Canada, as they devoted their lives to advocacy in the 1880s, through to the 1890s. As the group first convened in Alberta, the five were initially referred to as &quot;The Alberta Five&quot; by the media. However, as a result of the group&#x27;s importance to Canada as a whole, the group was eventually referred to as &quot;The Famous Five&quot;.

===Henrietta Muir Edwards===

Henrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women&#x27;s topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women of Canada and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during World War I. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes. She was also a founding member of the Victorian Order of Nurses.

===Nellie McClung===

Nellie McClung&#x27;s jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women&#x27;s rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit]. In 1918, she was a member of the Dominion War Council and the only woman representative at the League of Nations. McClung famously said &quot;I‘ve never thought minding my own business is much of a virtue. Too often it‘s just an excuse for not taking action when action needs taking!&quot;. She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Board of the Governors. In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party. She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men . In the 1960s, after McClung&#x27;s name had not been mentioned for nearly a decade, feminists had rediscovered and had given McClung and the famous five their fame. McClung was very well known for her passion for the independence of women and her drive in order to achieve the rights women deserve.

===Louise McKinney===

Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union in Alberta and the West – she was the organization&#x27;s vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the United Church of Canada, and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union.

===Emily Murphy===

Emily Murphy stood out among the Famous Five, as she was the British Empire&#x27;s first female judge. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916, and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women&#x27;s Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position, and many men objected.

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name &quot;Janey Canuck&quot;. In 1922, she wrote &quot;The Black Candle&quot; which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day.

In 1958, the Government of Canada had named Emily Murphy a Person of Nation Historic Significance. Several decades even after the Person&#x27;s case, the Senate of Canada had voted to acknowledge the five women in the “Famous Five” as honorary senators.

===Irene Parlby===

In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta, and in 1921 was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She was also the first female Cabinet minister in Alberta, and still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case. She was a cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during World War I and later served on the Board of Governors of the University of Alberta.

==The &quot;Persons Case&quot;==
During the year 1917 a discussion began surrounding women and their position in the senate, for 10 years this debate continued, however, was disregarded in 1927 as the Canadian BNA act implied it was impossible In August 1927, Emily Murphy invited four women activists, Nellie McClung, Irene Parlby, Louise McKinney and Henrietta Muir Edwards, to her home in Edmonton to discuss plans to petition the Canadian government to submit a reference question to the Supreme Court of Canada regarding the interpretation of the word &quot;persons&quot; in the &quot;British North America Act&quot;.

On 27 August 1927, the five women, who became known as the Famous Five, sent a petition to the Governor General of Canada. The petition requested that the government ask the Supreme Court if power was vested in the governor general in council, the prime minister of Canada, or both, to appoint a woman to the Senate of Canada; and if it was constitutionally possible to make provisions that would allow for the appointment of a woman. In response to the petition, the Canadian government referred the following question to the Supreme Court: &quot;Does the word &#x27;Persons&#x27; in section 24 of the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;, include female persons?&quot;

On 24 April 1928, the Supreme Court held that women were not &quot;qualified persons&quot; within the meaning of s. 24 of the &quot;British North America Act&quot;. The ruling was based on the premise that the term should be interpreted in the same way as in 1867, and that the act would have specifically mentioned women if they had meant to make an exception for the Senate.

The Five then appealed the decision of the Supreme Court to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. On 18 October 1929, the Judicial Committee allowed their appeal and overturned the decision of the Supreme Court. The Judicial Committee concluded that the term &quot; &#x27;persons&#x27; does include women, and that women are eligible to be summoned to and become members of the Senate of Canada&quot;. The judgment was delivered by the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Sankey, who stated:

As a result of the Famous 5&#x27;s determination and advocacy, the decision to overturn the supreme court and give women the title of “persons” was enacted. October 18, 1929 was officially the start to a movement that would live on for generations and invoke four new waves of feminism.

==Legacy==
===Honorary senators===

The Famous Five built their foundation for women&#x27;s rights on the idea of women in the Senate. However, none of the Famous Five ever became a part of the Senate, they opened the doors for Cairine Wilson, the first female senator. The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful House of Commons of Canada had elected its first female member (Agnes Macphail) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women&#x27;s participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the Alberta legislature. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult. The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
The famous five were women rights advocates, however, advocacy was a lifestyle to them. Each of the famous five women had strong beliefs in other aspects of life that they would protest for. Some individuals believed they were powerful women but others took no interest in their fights or even actively opposed some of their ideas, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have eugenics legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed &quot;mentally deficient&quot; or &quot;insane&quot; in Alberta and elsewhere. Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the Famous Five. Her causes included women&#x27;s right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life. Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as &quot;tenacious&quot; with her work with prohibition.

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women&#x27;s rights. Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers&#x27; allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the &quot;evils of alcohol&quot; and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the Dower Act. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.

===Commemorations===

The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the foyer and antechamber of Canada&#x27;s Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist Barbara Paterson, one on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the other at the Olympic Plaza in Calgary. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included songs in French and English, Inuit dancers, and speeches by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson and Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of Edmonton has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the &quot;Famous Five&quot;.

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women&#x27;s Institute of Canada, vice-president of National Council of Women of Canada, president of Canadian Women&#x27;s Press Club, director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women&#x27;s Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life&#x27;s work including being decorated by King George V to be a Lady of Grace of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the University of Alberta with an honorary doctor of laws degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards&#x27; passing and spoke of Edwards, &quot;who for 40 years was the convener of laws for the National Council of Women&quot; should not be forgotten.

The Five were commemorated in the 2001 Journey Series of Canada&#x27;s fifty-dollar bill, along with Thérèse Casgrain, a feminist and politician from Quebec. In December 2011, the Bank of Canada announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 Frontier Series banknote that it issued in 2012.
The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

<text>Akkrum is a village in the Dutch province of Friesland. It is located in the municipality Heerenveen, about 17 km south of the city of Leeuwarden.

Akkrum had about 3,395 inhabitants in 2017.

==History==
The village was first mentioned in 1315 as Ackrom. The etymology is unclear. Akkrum started as a &quot;terp&quot; (artificial living mound) village, and developed into a linear settlement which served as the regional centre. It started to grow when the main road Leeuwarden-Zwolle and later a railway line were built next to Akkrum. The Dutch Reformed church was built in 1759 as a replacement of a medieval church. The tower dates from 1882. In 1840, Akkrum was home to 1,121 people.

The polder mill Mellemolen was built in 1849 to drain excess water from the Polslootpolder. In 1972, the mill was toppled in a storm, and restored in 1976. The mill was surrounded by industry and it was moved two kilometers in 2003 to 2004. It only operates on a voluntary basis.

Before 2014, Akkrum was part of the Boarnsterhim municipality and before 1984 it was part of Utingeradeel.

==Transportation==
Akkrum has a railway station - Akkrum railway station - with services to Leeuwarden, Zwolle, Amersfoort and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.

<text>Arnemuiden is a city of around 5000 people in the municipality of Middelburg in the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands. It is located on the former island of Walcheren, about 3 km east of the city of Middelburg.

On the 23 September 1338, at the start of the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France, a naval battle was held near Arnemuiden. It was the first naval battle of the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the first naval battle using artillery, as the English ship &quot;Christofer&quot; had three cannons and one handgun.

In 1573, Arnemuiden was destroyed by Spanish troops and more than 300 citizens were killed. Even though only a couple of hundred people were left, it received city rights in 1574.

Until 1997, Arnemuiden was a separate municipality. Arnemuiden has a railway station - Arnemuiden railway station.

A substantial part of the inhabitants of Arnemuiden have been a fisherman in some part of their life. This explains the immense popularity of tattoos and fishing ship earrings in the village.

&quot;De klok van Arnemuiden&quot; is a Dutch song about the church clock at the Arnemuiden central market.

<text>Lord Shingen Yashida (also Shingen Harada) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of Wolverine.

The character was played by Hiroyuki Sanada in the 2013 film &quot;The Wolverine&quot;.

==Publication history==
Shingen first appeared in &quot;Wolverine&quot; #1 (Sept. 1982) and was created by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller.

==Fictional character biography==
Shingen was a ruthless, combat-hungry, and megalomaniacal crime lord who used his yakuza connections to become the leader of the Yashida clan, ruling over the syndicate with an iron fist. To settle a personal debt incurred during his rise to power, Shingen forced his daughter Mariko Yashida to marry yakuza boss Noboru Hideki against her will. Wolverine found out Noboru beat Mariko nearly to death and confronted Noboru but relented from killing him upon Mariko&#x27;s insistence. Shingen had Wolverine poisoned, temporarily weakening him so that Shingen could beat and humiliate the superhuman mutant in a duel with bokken in front of Mariko. Shingen used his expert knowledge of human anatomy to secretly attack Wolverine&#x27;s nerve endings in such a way so as to make the duel life-threatening. But as Mariko did not know this, when Wolverine attempted to use his claws to save himself, it appeared to Mariko that Wolverine was cheating. Mariko did not know that Wolverine&#x27;s body had been saturated with enough lethal poison to kill several dozen ordinary men, or that Shingen was the one who was actually cheating in the duel. This had the effect of disgracing Wolverine in front of her, which was the design of Shingen. Logan was then dumped onto the Tokyo streets and found by Yukio, Shingen&#x27;s best assassin. Yukio participated in deception with the Hand ninja clan to manipulate Wolverine into assassinating a rival crime lord, using Mariko as unwitting bait for additional motivation. After his role was completed, Shingen ordered Logan killed, but Yukio ignored the order. This led to the Hand being sent to enforce his will. In the events resulting from that action, including the death of a personal friend by Yukio, Wolverine realized that Yukio was the one who poisoned him at Shingen&#x27;s residence and was being played for a fool at apparently Shingen&#x27;s orders. After a philosophic epiphany about humanity, Logan then completely destroyed the Yashida criminal empire and confronted Shingen a second time. Shingen did not survive the confrontation. Mariko revealed she&#x27;d planned to kill her dishonorable father personally then commit seppuku in recompense had not Logan prevented her. Afterward, Mariko and Wolverine decided to marry, with the X-Men receiving an invitation from the Emperor of Japan for the event.

It is later revealed that his illegitimate son Kenuichio Harada wanted to inherit Shingen&#x27;s position.

Shingen was briefly resurrected by Phaedra of the Hand as part of a campaign of revenge against Wolverine.

==Powers and abilities==
Lord Shingen had no superhuman abilities but was in peak physical condition despite his age, and he was one of the finest swordsmen and martial artists in all of Japan. Highly intelligent, he had extensive knowledge of human anatomy, pressure points, and great knowledge of poisons and assassination techniques. Shingen was highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations and very well connected in the international criminal underworld, particularly in areas of drug traffic.

==Other versions==
In the comic series &quot;Exiles&quot;, a younger version of Shingen Yashida exists in the home reality of Mariko Yashida (aka Sunfire).

==In other media==
===Television===
* Shingen Yashida appears in &quot;Marvel Anime: Wolverine&quot;, voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata in the Japanese version and by Fred Tatasciore in the English dub. This version is the leader of the Kuzuryū syndicate (a yakuza faction) and a notorious member of A.I.M., serving as their weapons dealer. He arranges for his own daughter Mariko Yashida to be married against her will to Hideki Kurohagi of Madripoor, with the series focusing on Wolverine working to prevent the marriage and rescuing Mariko. He is also enemies with the Madripoor rebel leader Koh, who killed his son after he fell in love and started a family with one of Shingen&#x27;s top assassins, whom he also killed when she turned on him. When Koh resurfaced years later to get his revenge on Shingen and Hideki, Shingen sadistically mocked his obsession with revenge and fatally wounded both him and his granddaughter Yukio. By the end of the series, in a last-ditch attempt to stop Wolverine and consolidate his power, Shingen banishes Hideki, Mariko, and his own henchmen and dons a special armor made of Vibranium and steel to battle Wolverine, during which he is killed.

===Film===
Shingen Yashida appears in &quot;The Wolverine&quot;, portrayed by Hiroyuki Sanada. In addition to being the father of Mariko Yashida, this version is the son of billionaire Ichirō Yashida and foster brother of Yukio. After the Yashidas&#x27; technology empire is left to Mariko despite Shingen&#x27;s attempts to cover up his father&#x27;s near-bankruptcy, Shingen began seeking vengeance, developing an obsession with humiliating and killing Ichirō, and ruthlessly betrays his family by conspiring with Japan&#x27;s Minister of Justice Noburo Mori and the yakuza to kill Mariko for taking what he saw as his and gain his father&#x27;s admiration. After he is poisoned by Viper, Shingen dons the Yashida Clan&#x27;s traditional samurai armor and attacks and attempts to brutally kill Yukio, but is instead defeated and killed by Logan.

<text>Bovenkarspel is a town in the municipality of Stede Broec in the Dutch province of North Holland. Situated in the West Friesland region, Bovenkarspel is known for its agricultural heritage, particularly its historical ties to horticulture and flower cultivation.

== History ==

=== Bronze Age ===
The area around Bovenkarspel was settled by early human communities during the Bronze Age (around 2000 to 800 BCE). Archaeological evidence, including tools and burial mounds, suggests that the inhabitants practiced farming and engaged in basic metalworking. The region&#x27;s fertile land and proximity to waterways made it a suitable location for early settlers.

=== Golden Age ===
Due to its strategic location between the cities of Enkhuizen and Hoorn, both vital ports in the Dutch maritime economy in the Dutch Golden Age, Bovenkarspel, and neighbouring villages, were situated along a key road which facilitated the movement of trading goods. The town remained a predominantly agricultural area.

=== 20th Century ===
In the 20th Century, Bovenkarspel, like the rest of the Netherlands, was affected by the German occupation during World War II. On May 10th, Bovenkarspel and the other neighbouring villages were liberated. Canadian troops marched through the village and celebrations were held the same day. 

The post-war era saw a shift towards suburban development as industrialization spread, and the population grew. The late 20th century also saw the growth of the city of Hoorn, which influenced Bovenkarspel&#x27;s development. The town, which had resembled a linear settlement up until that point, underwent residential development both to the North and South of the railway and the Streekhof shopping mall was built.

Bovenkarspel became part of the larger municipality of Stede Broec, which was formed on January 1, 1979, in which the towns of Bovenkarspel, Grootebroek, and Lutjebroek form a larger residential area together. The town hall is located in Bovenkarspel next to the shopping mall.

=== 21st Century ===
In the 21st century, the town has transitioned into a more residential and commuter town, with many of its residents working in nearby cities. While agriculture, particularly flower cultivation, still plays a role in the local economy, the area has seen growth in housing and services to accommodate its expanding population.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2019-2020, the town&#x27;s &quot;Ceres&quot; windmill was severely damaged by a fire. The fire, which had been sparked by fireworks, destroyed the windmill&#x27;s upper structure, prompting widespread restoration efforts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the town gained national attention following an explosion outside a local COVID-19 test centre. The attack, believed to be linked to rising unrest over pandemic restrictions, caused property damage but no injuries.

On March 18, 2022, the restored windmill was opened by Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands who revealed a commemorative plaque at the site.

==1999 Legionellosis outbreak==

In March 1999 an outbreak of Legionnaires&#x27; disease occurred during a flower exhibition in Bovenkarspel. Many people were hospitalized in Hoorn. 318 people became ill and at least 32 died. Probably more victims died and were buried before the legionellosis infection was recognized. The source of the bacteria was a hot tub in the exhibition area.

==Transportation==

Bovenkarspel is well-connected by road to nearby towns and cities in North Holland. The village is primarily served by the N302 and N506 highways, providing easy access to neighbouring places such as Hoorn and Enkhuizen.

Public transportation is available through regional bus services, which connect Bovenkarspel to other localities in the municipality and beyond. For longer-distance travel, residents can make use of one of the two railway stations in Bovenkarspel - Bovenkarspel-Grootebroek and Bovenkarspel Flora - with half-hourly connections to cities such as Hoorn, Amsterdam and Heerlen/Maastricht.

<text>The Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis holds that the Old Norse goddesses Frigg and Freyja descend from a common Proto-Germanic figure, as suggested by the numerous similarities found between the two deities. Scholar Stephan Grundy comments that &quot;the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.&quot;

The names &quot;Freyja&quot; and &quot;Vanir&quot; (the group of gods to which Freyja belongs) are not attested outside of Scandinavia, as opposed to the name of the goddess &quot;Frigg&quot;, who is mentioned as &quot;Frīg&quot; in Old English and as &quot;Frīja&quot; in Old High German, all stemming from Proto-Germanic *&quot;Frijjō&quot;. Although there is no similar evidence for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which &quot;Freyja&quot; descends, some scholars have argued that this may simply be due to the scarcity of records outside of the North Germanic tradition.

==Etymology==
It has also been suggested that the names &quot;Freyja&quot; and &quot;Frigg&quot; may stem from a common linguistic source. This theory, however, is rejected by most linguists in the field, who interpret the name &quot;Frigg&quot; as related to the Proto-Germanic verb &quot;*frijōn&quot; (&#x27;to love&#x27;) and stemming from a substantivized feminine of the adjective *&quot;frijaz&quot; (&#x27;free&#x27;), whereas &quot;Freyja&quot; is regarded as descending from a feminine form of *&quot;frawjōn&quot; (&#x27;lord&#x27;). On the other hand, the names &quot;Freyja&quot; (&#x27;lady, mistress&#x27;) and &quot;Freyr&quot; (&#x27;lord&#x27;) are cognates stemming from the common root *&quot;frawjōn&quot;, which does not necessarily imply further relation.

==Common mythological traits==
Both Frigg and Freyja are associated with weaving, combining the aspects of a love goddess and a domestic goddess. In Sweden and some parts of Germany, the asterism of Orion&#x27;s Belt is known as her distaff or spindle.

==In popular culture==
In the 2018 Santa Monica Studio game &quot;God of War&quot;, and in its 2022 sequel &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot; the character Freyja is frequently referred to as Frigg. The stated reason in game is whenever she accomplished something, Odin would attribute it to Frigg in an attempt to shroud her accomplishments under the Aesir banner. 

In the universe of Marvel Comics, Frigga the adopted mother of Thor and the Asgardian goddess Freya were initially written as different characters. Beginning with &quot;Loki: Agent of Asgard&quot; in 2015, Frigga has exclusively used the name Freyja, although a separate character with the name &quot;Freya&quot; has also made scarce appearance.

<text>Haida pick-up sticks exist in two sorts. There were non-decorated thin playing sticks (not collected) and the other decorated, containing three sets of sticks. These were named after animals or birds only known by the owner or his family, according to Charles F. Newcombe.

The decoration consists of rings and spiral markings for distinction. Most elaborated sets may contain a Haida art gallery of more than fifty drawings. Made of maple wood, they are decorated with pyro-engravings or carvings. Many pyro-engravings are inlaid with copper or abalone shell. The drawings are complex and an artistic challenge as they are wrapped around a cylinder. Their form is unlocked through slow rotation and are sometimes animated cartoon-like with themes of moving shamans, birds, whales, war scenes, hunting, fishing, etc. The compositions are small and not more than 2 cm in length. The sticks were a field where the Haida became truly documentary. Franz Boas, Swanton and others published drawings of many art sets. George T. Emmons recorded many details about a full set owned by a Tlingit Indian.

It is possibly related to the pick-up sticks game played today, most notably the Jackstraws variation.

<text>Kau chim, kau cim, chien tung, &quot;lottery poetry&quot; and Chinese fortune sticks are names for a fortune telling practice that originated in China in which a person poses questions and interprets answers from flat sticks inscribed with text or numerals. The practice is often performed in a Taoist or Buddhist temple in front of an altar. In the US, a version has been sold since 1915 under the name chi chi sticks. It is also sometimes known as &quot;The Oracle of Kuan Yin&quot; in Buddhist traditions, a reference to the bodhisattva Guanyin. It is widely available in Thai temples, known using the Teochew dialect as siam si (). The similar practice is also found in Japan, named O-mikuji.

==Tools==

* &quot;Chim bucket&quot; (): A long cylindrical bamboo cup or tube.
* &quot;Kau shim sticks&quot; (): The flat sticks which are stored in the tube. Generally made of bamboo, they resemble wide, flat incense sticks, and are often painted red at one end. A single number, both in Arabic numerals and in Chinese characters, is inscribed on each stick. Each stick has a different number on it, and no two are alike. There are usually a total of 100 sticks in the cup, although the chi chi Sticks variation sold in the US for fortune telling has only 78 sticks.
* 100 written oracle outcomes (or 78, for the Chi Chi sticks variation). A German, Werner Banck, has classified the contents of 420 sets into 24 categories and 160 sub-categories.

==History==
The practice of &quot;kau chim&quot; or &quot;chien tung&quot; interpretation dates back to the Jin dynasty, according to the &quot;Jade Box Records&quot;, an ancient Chinese book on date selection, written by the famous Taoist monk Xu Xun in the 3rd century AD. Despite the Cultural Revolution in mainland China during the 1960s and 1970s, lottery poetry still persists today in temples in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore. Most Taoist temples have lottery poetry to provide religious guidance for believers.

==Practice==

The prediction begins with the cup storing a number of the sticks. After the querent has finished their devotions to the main deity, the querent purifies the cylinder by revolving it around the incense burner three times and mixing the sticks by hand. The querent kneels in prayer, holding the cup between their palms and asking their question to the deity, either aloud or by whispering. This part is done decisively, as one should not shift questions or hesitate on the question in the middle of the rite. The shaking of the cylinder, which is usually tipped slightly downward, results in at least one stick leaving the cylinder and being dropped onto the floor. In most cases, if multiple sticks leave the cylinder, those fortunes do not count and must be shaken again. Each stick, with its designated number, represents one answer.

When a single stick falls out, the number will correspond to one of the hundred written oracles with an answer on it. The writing on the piece of paper will provide an answer to the question. In most cases, to confirm the validity of the answer given by the deity, the querent will pick up and toss two jiaobei blocks. Each block is round on one side and flat on the other. A successful answer requires one flat and one round side to be facing up, a failed answer will result in two round sides facing up. Much emphasis is placed on denial when both sides flat are tossed; some legends say when this happens, the deities are laughing at the querent. The querent will have the option to ask for a fortune again until a successful answer can be made.

Following a successful fortune, interpretation may be needed to comprehend the answer. Answers can be interpreted by a temple priest or volunteers or can be self-interpreted by the querent. In many cases, an offering is made prior to the asking of the question in order to carry good favor from the higher powers. These offerings typically consist of incense, fresh fruits, cakes, or monetary donations.

==Alternative tools and practice==
At places such as the Thean Hou Temple in Kuala Lumpur, the handheld bucket is replaced with a larger container. On the inside at the bottom of the container are protrusions (such as the heads of fixing bolts). To consult the oracle, the querent holds the sticks (sometimes refer to as oracle sticks) in a vertical bundle, raises them a little inside the bucket and drops them while holding them loosely. Any stick that stands proud of the rest (because it is resting on a protrusion, not having bounced off) is considered part of the divined answer.

==Interpretation==
The stick result is analyzed by an interpreter, who has a book of Chinese poetic phrases and stories. The interpretation is generally short ranged, typically covering no more than one year, using Chinese New Year as the starting point. The interpreter typically charges a small fee. Often, interpreters provide other services such as palm or face reading.

Because the supposed accuracy of the prediction very much depends on the interpreter, some people run the result through a number of different interpreters to see whether similar results are drawn. The interpreted answer is usually a historical Chinese story re-told in modern sense. The story is basically the forthcoming event the querent is about to experience.

In some traditions, the believer draws one lottery and looks for the corresponding poem to the lottery. The poems are written or printed on a piece of paper, usually long and wide, with a Jueju poem on each piece as the answer to the believer from the gods.

==Locale==

In Hong Kong, by and large the most popular place for this fortune telling practice is the Wong Tai Sin Temple which draws thousands to millions of people each year.

In Thailand, &quot;kau chim&quot; is commonly known as seam si (; alternatively spelled &quot;siem si&quot;, &quot;siem see&quot;). It is believed that &quot;seam si&quot; came to Thailand with the Chinese diasporas and was presumably first introduced at the oldest Chinese temple in Thailand; the in Pattani Province. The oracles were only available in Chinese until as early as the reign of King Chulalongkorn, where one of the earliest translation of the oracles were printed in Thai by Plean Sae-song (เปลี่ยน แซ่ซ้อง) for Wat Kanlayanamit in Thonburi.

In 1915, &quot;kau chim&quot; sticks were introduced to the United States under the trade name &quot;Chi Chi Chinese Fortune Teller&quot; by the Pacific Dry Goods Company of San Francisco, California, where a large population of Cantonese Chinese immigrants had settled. The Chi Chi sticks, 78 in number, were made in China of bamboo but they were marked with Arabic numerals instead of Chinese characters, and were packaged in a bright yellow and red chipboard tube with a black lid (like a modern mailing tube). They were accompanied by a rolled-up booklet of 78 rhyming interpretations that fit inside the tube with the sticks.

By the early 1920s, chi chi sticks were available all across America, from several importers and under a variety of trade names, including &quot;Chien Tung Fortune Teller.&quot; They were heavily marketed to African American fortune tellers through mail-order catalogs. They fell out of popularity during World War II, but only due to problems with supply, as China had been invaded by Japan and trade routes were disrupted.

In the 1990s, importations of &quot;kau chim&quot; sticks were available again in the US. This time, packaged in leather-covered tubes painted with ornate Chinese designs, but also with the old rhyming Chi Chi stick booklet so well known to Americans. Meanwhile, vintage Chi Chi sticks of the 1915-1935 era (if all their parts and the booklet are intact) have become highly desired artifacts among those who collect fortune telling objects.

The practice of using sticks in Chien Tung may be related to the game of pick-up sticks played today. This theory is based on a Japanese variation, called Mikado, which also has an emperor stick. A form of the game developed in the 16th century and may have been adapted from Chinese culture and religion.

Some Taoist temples in Taiwan and Malaysia also revere a special Medicinal Oracle sticks (藥簽) which the poems are written in the form of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) concoction. Visitors can use the poem to buy items from the nearby Traditional Chinese Medicine shop. This was a common practice at certain Baosheng Dadi temples in olden days.

<text>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (also known as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2) is a 1986 American black comedy slasher film co-composed and directed by Tobe Hooper, and written by L. M. Kit Carson. It is the sequel to &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974) and the second installment in &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; film series. The film stars Dennis Hopper, Caroline Williams, Bill Johnson, Bill Moseley, and Jim Siedow. The plot follows Vanita &quot;Stretch&quot; Brock, a radio host who is victimized and abducted by Leatherface and his cannibalistic family; meanwhile, Lt. Boude &quot;Lefty&quot; Enright, the uncle of Sally and Franklin Hardestyboth prior victims of the familyhunts them down.

Development of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; began following the 1981 theatrical re-release of the original film, which proved to be a financial success. After several delays, Hooper hired collaborator Carson to write the screenplay for the film in early 1986, with an emphasis on dark comedy, an element Hooper felt was present in the first film but went unacknowledged by audiences and critics. The Cannon Group served as the production company and distributor as part of a three-film deal the studio had struck with Hooper, having produced his previous two films, &quot;Lifeforce&quot; (1985) and &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; (1986). Principal photography occurred in Austin, Texas in the spring of 1986.

&quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; was released in the United States on August 22, 1986, and earned over half of its $4.5–4.6 million budget during its opening weekend before going on to gross $8 million domestically. It received mixed reception from film critics and audiences, largely due to its emphasis on black comedy and gore, which departed from the first film&#x27;s approach that featured minimal violence, low-budget vérité style, and atmosphere to build tension and fear. The film&#x27;s promotional materials featured a satirical bent, with its theatrical one-sheet parodying the poster art for John Hughes&#x27;s popular teen comedy film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985).

Despite its mixed reception, the film eventually gained a cult following. It was followed by &quot;&quot; in 1990.

== Plot ==
Two high school seniors, Buzz and Rick, race along a desolate stretch of Texas highway, en route to the Texas-OU football game at the Dallas Cotton Bowl, and harass a pickup truck along the way. Heavily intoxicated, they use their car phone to call and harass on-air radio DJ Vanita &quot;Stretch&quot; Brock. Unable to convince them to hang up, Stretch is forced to keep the line open. As the two pass the same pickup truck, Leatherface emerges from the back of the truck and rips up the roof using his chainsaw. Rick tries shooting Leatherface with his revolver, but Leatherface kills Buzz. The car crashes, killing Rick.

The following morning, Lieutenant Boude &quot;Lefty&quot; Enright, former Texas Ranger, and uncle of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, who were victims of Leatherface and his family years earlier, arrives at the scene of the crime to help solve Buzz and Rick&#x27;s murders. Lefty has spent the last thirteen years looking into his nephew&#x27;s disappearance, investigating reports of mysterious chainsaw killings across Texas. He is contacted by Stretch, who brings him a copy of the audio tape that recorded the attack. He sends her away, leaving Stretch and her coworker L.G. Peters to reluctantly cover a Texas/Oklahoma Chili Cookoff for their radio show. The winner of the cookoff happens to be Drayton Sawyer, the current patriarch of the cannibalistic Sawyer family, who declares that his secret is having an eye for &quot;prime meat.&quot;

Meanwhile, Lefty shops for chainsaws at a local hardware store. He at first unnerves, then amuses the shop&#x27;s owner with his brutal testing of the saws on a log. Lefty then drives to Stretch&#x27;s radio station and asks her to play the tape on her nightly radio show so that the public, which had previously mocked his case, will have to listen to him.

Driving home from his chili cookoff victory with his family, Drayton is called by Chop Top about the tape being broadcast, so he sends him and Leatherface to the radio station. While she is about to leave for the night, Stretch is confronted by Chop Top before being attacked by Leatherface. Chop Top brutally bludgeons L.G. with a hammer. Meanwhile, Leatherface corners Stretch and is about to kill her, but she charms him into sparing her. Leatherface returns to Chop Top and leads him to believe that he has killed Stretch. As they take L.G. to their home, they are followed by Stretch, who ends up trapped inside the Sawyers&#x27; subterranean lair, located in an abandoned amusement park and decorated with human bones, multi-colored lights, and carnival remnants.

Lefty, who has been following their car all along, arrives equipped with chainsaws and proceeds to vandalize the lair before finding Franklin&#x27;s remains. Meanwhile, Stretch is found by Leatherface, who puts L.G.&#x27;s skinned face and hat on her before tying her arms and leaving. Later, a still alive L.G. frees Stretch before dying. Leatherface finds Stretch and the family capture her. Drayton scolds Leatherface when he finds out that Stretch was not killed. They torture her at the dinner table, but Lefty arrives and saves her. Stretch flees the grounds, with Chop Top chasing after her. Lefty wounds Drayton, then he and Leatherface get into a chainsaw fight, in which Leatherface is fatally wounded. The dying Drayton, accepting that he and his family have lost, takes a grenade from Nubbins&#x27;s corpse and frags himself, Lefty, Leatherface and Grandpa.

Chop Top chases Stretch to the top of a stone tower in the amusement park. Stretch grabs a chainsaw from the corpse of the family&#x27;s grandmother in a shrine and fatally wounds Chop Top, causing him to fall off the tower to his death. Stretch shouts in triumph and swings the chainsaw in the air, her physical movements echoing Leatherface&#x27;s &quot;chainsaw dance&quot; from the closing scene of &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;.

==Cast==

Kinky Friedman appears in a cameo as Sports Anchorman, as does Dan Jenkins as T.V. Commentator and Joe Bob Briggs as Gonzo Moviegoer; Hooper also cameos.

== Production ==
===Development===
Following New Line Cinema&#x27;s profitable 1981 theatrical re-release of &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), director Tobe Hooper began developing a sequel to his original film. The project did not culminate until several years later, when &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced the project in a November 2, 1983 trade advertisement.

The film was financed by Cannon Films as part of a three-picture deal the studio had struck with Hooper, having previously produced and distributed his films &quot;Lifeforce&quot; (1985) and &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; (1986). Hooper initially planned to serve only as a producer, but was enlisted as director when he could not find a director that the producers could afford.
According to the documentary &quot;Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films&quot;, Cannon Films anticipated a straightforward horror film, while Hooper sought to make the sequel a black comedy. Hooper enlisted L. M. Kit Carson to write the screenplay, which he began in January 1986.

===Casting===
Gunnar Hansen was initially approached to reprise his role as Leatherface, but he claimed to have been offered &quot;scale, plus ten percent&quot; with the ten percent going to his agent. When he replied that he had no agent, they offered scale without the additional ten percent. Hansen found the offer too low. Unit publicist Scott Holton offered an alternate story claiming Hansen vacillated about the part and the offer was rescinded. Holton didn&#x27;t believe the average viewer was even aware of who the original actors were, claiming &quot;who &quot;are&quot; Neal, Hansen or Burns?&quot;

Bill Moseley created a short film parody entitled &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Manicure&quot;, where he played a small role as the Hitchhiker and showed it to a screenwriter who was able to show it to Tobe Hooper. Hooper loved it and kept Moseley in mind for a part should he ever make a sequel. When the time came to cast &quot;Chainsaw 2&quot;, Moseley was contacted for the role of Chop Top, the Hitchhiker&#x27;s twin brother.

===Filming===
Principal photography of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; began on May 5, 1986, in Austin, Texas metropolitan area. Shooting locations in the city included the Cut Rite chainsaw store, as well as the interiors of the former &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; building. The majority of the shoot occurred in and around the shuttered Matterhorn Amusement Park in Prairie Dell, which stood in for the fictional Texas Battle Land amusement park where the Sawyer family&#x27;s lair is located. The film&#x27;s opening scene was shot at the Old Iron Bridge in Bastrop.

===Post-production===
Several scenes were deleted by director Tobe Hooper due to pacing issues as mentioned on the 2000 &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Shocking Truth&quot; documentary. One lengthy scene that was cut from the film involves the Sawyer Clan heading out at night to collect prime meat for their chili by slaughtering patrons exiting a movie theater and a group of rowdy, rioting fans in a parking garage. The deleted slaughtering scene featured several elaborate Tom Savini special effects. The deleted scene at the movie theater also includes a cameo by American film critic Joe Bob Briggs.

==Release==
===Marketing===
The final poster design, featuring the family sitting together, is a parody of the poster for the 1985 teen comedy-drama film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was released theatrically in the United States by Cannon Films on August 22, 1986. It earned over half of its budget back during its opening weekend, and went on to gross a total of $8,025,872 at the domestic box office.

===Critical response===
At the time of its release, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; was met with mixed reviews from film critics. Roger Ebert awarded the film one star out of four, lambasting the film because it &quot;goes flat-out from one end to the other, never spending any time on pacing, on timing, on the anticipation of horror. It doesn&#x27;t even pause to establish the characters; Dennis Hopper has the most thankless task, playing a man who spends the first half of the movie looking distracted and vague, and the second half screaming during chainsaw duels.&quot; He also commented that it &quot;has a lot of blood and disembowelment, to be sure, but it doesn&#x27;t have the terror of the original, the desire to be taken seriously. It&#x27;s a geek show.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s review was similarly negative, stating that &quot;the film feels as if Hooper himself has nothing but contempt for the original and went out of his way to tear it down.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the film, saying, &quot;Hooper&#x27;s direction is a little sloppy,&quot; and that the film &quot;is not first-grade chopped steak.&quot;

AllMovie&#x27;s review was favorable, writing, &quot;much-hated at the time of its release, Tobe Hooper&#x27;s &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; has aged remarkably well, now playing as a strangely effective if none-too-subtle satire of several facets of &#x27;80s excess.&quot;

&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2&quot; holds a 52% approval rating on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 33 reviews with an average rating of 5.1/10. Its consensus reads, &quot;Without the tense atmosphere of its predecessor, the stakes feel lower, but &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; still shocks with a gonzo blend of over-the-top humor and gore.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 42 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. It has since become a cult film.

=== Censorship ===
Similarly to the first film, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; faced significant censorship in numerous countries. In the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) refused to grant the film an R rating for theatrical release, despite it undergoing numerous cuts to tone down its violence. &quot;I told [executive producers Menachem Golan and Yoram Globus], going in, that there was no way we could get an R rating on that picture,&quot; said Hooper, &quot;but they kept chopping away at it.&quot; When the MPAA refused to grant the film anything less than an X rating, Cannon Films opted to release it without a rating.

The film was banned in Germany and Singapore, though the Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft in Germany later gave the uncut version an 18 rating, and Singapore gave it an R21 (Restricted to under 21) rating after an appeal. When the film was submitted in the United Kingdom to the BBFC for a certificate, the BBFC notified Cannon, the distributor, that at least 20 to 25 minutes of footage would have to be trimmed in order for the film to be given an 18 rating. Cannon attempted to cut the film, but eventually gave up after numerous re-edited versions failed to pass the BBFC. The uncut version of the film was eventually given an 18 rating in 2001. When released in Ontario, Canada the film had 11 minutes cut after being rejected three times by Ontario censors.

The film was banned in Australia for 20 years. An uncut version was released on VHS by Warner Home Video in New Zealand in 1987, but could also be found (illegally, as the box proudly stated) in some Australian video stores at the time. The New Zealand VHS cassette has become very rare. In 2000, an unofficial VHS release was issued to retailers throughout Australia. This was done so illegally by a duplicating house, and without the knowledge of the OFLC. When news of the illegal copies leaked, a number of retailers were raided for possessing infringing copies. The duplicating house was similarly raided by Federal Customs. The film was finally passed for official release in Australia on November 30, 2006. The Uncut &quot;Gruesome Edition&quot; DVD was released on January 24 the next year.

=== Home media ===
In 1995, a bootleg VHS edition of the film circulated among video dealers and collectors, surfacing at a &quot;Fangoria&quot; convention in New York City. Hooper himself stated that this version resembled an early rough cut of the film, assembled prior to its submission to the MPAA.

On September 1, 1998, the film was released on VHS by MGM Home Entertainment as part of the MGM Movie Time collection (which was available exclusively through Warner Home Video). On August 1, 2000, the film was released on a region 1 DVD by MGM Home Entertainment. On October 10, 2006, the film received a second DVD treatment from MGM, entitled &quot;The Gruesome Edition&quot;, which featured an audio commentary by director Tobe Hooper and David Gregory, director of &quot;Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Shocking Truth&quot;, as well as an audio commentary by actors Bill Moseley, Caroline Williams and special effects makeup creator Tom Savini. The special features also included deleted scenes, a feature-length documentary entitled &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot;, six still galleries and a trailer. A Blu-ray edition of the film was released on September 11, 2012 which featured all of the special features from the &quot;Gruesome Edition&quot; DVD.

Scream Factory released a Collector&#x27;s Edition Blu-ray on April 19, 2016, which went out of print on August 6, 2020. On October 25, 2022, Vinegar Syndrome released a three-disc 4K UHD Blu-ray edition of the film with archival and newly commissioned bonus features.

==Cultural references==
The song &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot; by Primus samples audio from the movie of Chop Top chuckling and saying &quot;Dog will hunt!&quot;.

==Sequel==

The official sequel to the film was &quot;&quot;. In 1998, Tobe Hooper&#x27;s son William Hooper, began work on &quot;All American Massacre&quot;, a short film that would be both a sequel and a prequel to &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;. Hooper ran out of funds for post-production in 2000 and the film was never completed and released although the trailer leaked online in the early 2000s.

<text>Air Marshal Robert Leckie, (16 April 1890 – 31 March 1975) was an air officer in the Royal Air Force and later in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and served as Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1944 to 1947. He initially served in the Royal Naval Air Service during the First World War, where he became known as one of &quot;the Zeppelin killers from Canada&quot;, after shooting down two airships. During the inter-war period he served as a Royal Air Force squadron and station commander, eventually becoming the RAF&#x27;s Director of Training in 1935, and was Air Officer Commanding RAF Mediterranean from 1938 until after the beginning of the Second World War. In 1940 he returned to Canada where he was primarily responsible for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, transferring to the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1942.

==Early life and background==
Leckie was born in Glasgow, Scotland, where his father and grandfather were weavers. In 1909 his family emigrated to Canada, where he worked for his uncle John Leckie while living in West Toronto.

==First World War==
Leckie was initially commissioned into the 1st Central Ontario Regiment, and in late 1915 paid Can$600 to begin flying training at the Curtiss Flying School on Toronto Island. However, he had completed only three hours of training in the Curtiss Model F flying boat at Hanlan&#x27;s Point, when the school was forced to close for the winter. At the urging of Sir Charles Kingsmill, the Chief of the Naval Staff of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Royal Navy agreed to accept half of the class, and Leckie was sent to England. On 6 December 1915, he was commissioned as a probationary temporary flight sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Service, and posted to Royal Navy Air Station Chingford, for training. On 10 May 1916, having accumulated 33 hours and 3 minutes flying time, he was granted Royal Aero Club Aviator&#x27;s Certificate No. 2923, and was then sent to RNAS Felixstowe for further training in flying boats. He was confirmed in his rank of flight sub-lieutenant in June, and in August was posted to RNAS Great Yarmouth to fly patrols over the North Sea.
Leckie&#x27;s first success came on 14 May 1917, as pilot of Curtiss Model H-12 &#x27;Large America&#x27; No. 8666, under the command of Flight Lieutenant Christopher John Galpin. The aircraft left Great Yarmouth on patrol at 03.30 a.m. in poor weather with heavy rain and low cloud. The weather cleared as she approached the Texel, and at 4:45 a.m. she spotted the Terschelling Light Vessel, and a few minutes later Zeppelin &quot;L 22&quot; about 10–15 miles away. The Curtiss increased speed and gained height, and Leckie took over the controls as Galpin manned the twin Lewis guns mounted in the bow. The Curtiss managed to approach to within half a mile before she was spotted, and the Zeppelin attempted to evade, but by then it was too late. The aircraft dived down alongside and Galpin fired an entire drum of incendiary bullets at a range of about 50 yards. The &quot;L 22&quot; rapidly caught fire, and crashed into the sea. The Curtiss returned to Great Yarmouth by 7:50 a.m., and they found only two bullet holes, in the left upper wing and the hull amidships, where the Germans had returned fire. On 22 June, for his part in downing the &quot;L 22&quot;, Leckie was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, while Galpin received the Distinguished Service Order. On 30 June Leckie was promoted to flight lieutenant.

Another memorable patrol began for Leckie at 10.35 a.m. on 5 September 1917, again flying Curtiss H-12 No. 8666 from Great Yarmouth, under Squadron Commander Vincent Nicholl. They were accompanied by a de Havilland DH.4 biplane, and were again heading for Terschelling. However, they were only part-way to their destination when they unexpectedly encountered the Zeppelins &quot;L 44&quot; and &quot;L 46&quot; accompanied by support ships. The British aircraft were hit by enemy fire, but pressed their attack on the &quot;L 44&quot;. Nicholl noted several hits on the Zeppelin from his guns, but it did not catch fire. Leckie then turned the aircraft to attack the &quot;L 46&quot;, but it had turned rapidly away and was out of range, as was the &quot;L 44&quot; by the time he turned back. Both British aircraft had been hit, and the DH.4&#x27;s engine soon failed. The Curtiss had also been hit in one engine and one wing was badly damaged. The DH.4 was forced to ditch into the sea, and Nicholl ordered Leckie to put the aircraft down to rescue the two crew. However, now with six men aboard, damaged, and in heavy seas Leckie was unable to take off again. Some 75 miles from the English coast, the aircraft began to taxi towards home. Their radio was waterlogged, but they did have four homing pigeons. Nicholl attached messages to the birds giving their position and course and sent them off at intervals. After four hours the aircraft ran out of fuel, and began to drift, so they improvised a sea anchor from empty fuel cans to steady it. That night the damaged wing tip broke off, and each man then had to spend two hours at a time outside balanced on the opposite wing to keep the broken wing from filling with water and dragging the aircraft under. After three days at sea, the six men were suffering badly. They had no food and only two gallons of drinking water, gained from draining the radiators of their water-cooled engines. Finally, at dawn on 8 September, as search operations were about to be called off, one of the pigeons was found, dead from exhaustion, by the coastguard station at Walcot, and shortly after midday they were rescued by the torpedo gunboat . Pigeon No. N.U.R.P./17/F.16331 was preserved, and originally kept in the officers&#x27; mess at RNAS Yarmouth, but is now on display at the RAF Museum Hendon. A brass plate on the display case bears the inscription &quot;A very gallant gentleman&quot;.

On 31 December 1917 Leckie was appointed a flight commander. While on patrol on 20 February 1918, Leckie spotted an enemy submarine on the surface, and attacked it with bombs, seeing one strike the vessel as it dived, leaving a large oil slick. Leckie was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 17 May 1918, only learning much later that he had not actually sunk it.
On 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and Leckie transferred to the new service with the rank of lieutenant (temporary captain), though on 8 April he was promoted to the temporary rank of major.

On 4 June 1918 Leckie led an offensive patrol of four Felixstowe F.2A flying boats and a Curtiss H.12 towards the Haaks Light Vessel off the Dutch coast. They saw no enemy aircraft until one of the F.2A&#x27;s, number N.4533, was forced down with a broken fuel feed-pipe. Five enemy seaplanes appeared, but seemed more interested in attacking the crippled F.2A. The remaining aircraft circled N.4533 as it taxied towards to the Dutch coast (where the crew eventually burned their aircraft before being interned), until ten more German seaplanes appeared. Leckie promptly led his small force into a head on attack, and a dogfight ensued which lasted for 40 minutes. Despite further mechanical difficulties – two other F2A&#x27;s also had problems with their fuel pipes and had to effect makeshift repairs while in the middle of the action – two German aircraft were shot down, and four badly damaged before the Germans broke off the action, for the loss of one F.2A and the Curtiss (its crew survived to be interned by the Dutch), and one man killed. Leckie&#x27;s force returned to Great Yarmouth, and in his report he bitterly remarked &quot;...these operations were robbed of complete success entirely through faulty petrol pipes... It is obvious that our greatest foes are not the enemy...&quot;

On the afternoon of 5 August 1918 a squadron of five Zeppelins took off from Friedrichshafen. They headed for the east coast of England, timing their flight to arrive off the coast just after dark. The leading airship, &quot;L 70&quot; was commanded by &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Johann von Lossnitzer, but also had &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; Peter Strasser, the &quot;Führer der Luftschiffe&quot; (&quot;Leader of Airships&quot;), the commander of the Imperial German Navy&#x27;s airship force, on board. However, the airship squadron was spotted while out at sea by the Lenman Tail lightship which signalled their course and position to the Admiralty. Responding to the report Major Egbert Cadbury jumped into the pilot&#x27;s seat of the only aircraft available, a DH.4, while Leckie occupied the observer/gunner&#x27;s position. After about an hour they spotted the &quot;L 70&quot; and attacked, with Leckie firing eighty rounds of incendiary bullets into her. Fire rapidly consumed the airship as it plummeted into the sea. Cadbury and Leckie, and another pilot Lieutenant Ralph Edmund Keys, then attacked and damaged another Zeppelin, which promptly turned tail and headed for home. All three received the Distinguished Flying Cross.

A few days later, on 11 August 1918 Leckie took part in another operation over the North Sea. Zeppelins often shadowed British naval ships, while carefully operating at higher altitudes than anti-aircraft guns or flying boats could achieve, and out of range of land based aircraft, so the Harwich Light Cruiser Force set out with a Sopwith Camel lashed to a decked lighter towed by the destroyer HMS &quot;Redoubt&quot;. When Leckie&#x27;s reconnaissance flight reported an approaching Zeppelin, the &quot;Redoubt&quot; steamed at full speed into the wind, allowing the Camel&#x27;s pilot Lieutenant Culley to take off with only a five-yard run. Culley climbed to 18,800 feet, approached the &quot;L 53&quot; out of the sun, and attacked with his twin Lewis guns, setting the airship on fire.

On 20 August 1918 Leckie was appointed commander of the newly formed No. 228 Squadron, flying the Curtis H-12 and Felixstowe F.2A out of Great Yarmouth. Within three months the armistice brought the fighting to an end.

==Inter-war career==
Leckie remained with the RAF until 31 March 1919 when he was transferred to the unemployed list, and simultaneously seconded to the Canadian Air Force with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel, to command the 1st Wing, Canadian Air Force. This unit comprised No. 81 Squadron (No. 1 Canadian), flying S.E.5 and Sopwith Dolphin fighters, and No. 123 Squadron (No. 2 Canadian), flying Airco DH.9A bombers, and was based at RAF Shoreham, Sussex. The Canadian Wing had been formed in August 1918 at RAF Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire, but never saw active service, and was eventually disbanded when the Canadian Expeditionary Force returned home.

On 1 August 1919 Leckie was granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force with the rank of major (later squadron leader), relinquishing his commission in the 1st Central Ontario Regiment of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada on the 31st.

On 15 December 1919 he was seconded for duty with the Canadian Air Board serving as Superintendent of Flying Operations. In this role he played a central role in the development of Canadian civil aviation, organizing and taking part in the first trans-Canada flight between Halifax and Vancouver. Leckie and Major Basil Hobbs flew from Halifax to Winnipeg between 7 and 10 October 1920, before other pilots and aircraft took over, finally arriving in Vancouver on the 17th.

Leckie&#x27;s secondment ended on 27 May 1922, and he returned to Britain to be posted to the No. 1 School of Technical Training at RAF Halton on 8 June. On 25 September he was posted the RAF Depot (Inland Area) as a supernumerary officer, in order to attend the Royal Navy Staff College. On 5 July 1923 he was posted to the Headquarters of RAF Coastal Area.

On 1 January 1926 Leckie was promoted to wing commander, and on 16 March was posted to Headquarters, Mediterranean, where on 30 March he joined the aircraft carrier to serve as Senior Air Force Officer. He returned to the depot at RAF Uxbridge on 11 May 1927, and on 26 August was posted to Headquarters, Coastal Area, while he waited for to be commissioned. Following the completion of her conversion to an aircraft carrier &quot;Courageous&quot; was commissioned at Devonport on 14 February 1928, and on 21 February Leckie joined her as Senior Air Force Officer.

Leckie returned to dry land on 5 September 1929, when he was appointed commander of RAF Bircham Newton, Norfolk. On 11 April 1931 he became commander of No. 210 Squadron RAF, initially based at Felixstowe, and then RAF Pembroke Dock, flying the Supermarine Southampton Mk. II. On 1 January 1933 Leckie was promoted to group captain, and on 30 January he was appointed both Superintendent of the RAF Reserve and commander of RAF Hendon. On 21 August 1935 Leckie was also appointed an additional Air Aide-de-Camp to King George V, attending the King&#x27;s funeral in that capacity on 28 January 1936, and was appointed Air Aide-de-Camp to King Edward VIII on 1 July 1936. Leckie was appointed Director of Training at the Air Ministry on 5 October 1936, taking over from Air Commodore Arthur Tedder, and was promoted to air commodore on 1 January 1937, handing over the post as Air Aide-de-Camp to the King to Group Captain Keith Park the same day. Leckie&#x27;s tenure as Director of Training ended on 28 November 1938, and on 2 December 1938 he was appointed Air Officer Commanding, RAF Mediterranean, based at Malta.

==Second World War==
In 1940, Leckie was seconded to the Royal Canadian Air Force to establish the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) in Canada. By the end of the war BCATP had trained 131,553 air crew from 11 countries. On 5 August 1941 he was promoted to the acting rank of air vice-marshal, and served as Member of the Air Council for Training. On 6 April 1942 Leckie was placed on the RAF retired list on accepting a commission in the Royal Canadian Air Force. On 2 June 1943 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). From 1 January 1944 until 31 August 1947 Leckie served as Chief of Staff, RCAF with the rank of air marshal.

For his service during the Second World War Leckie received the Order of Polonia Restituta (1st class) from the President of the Republic of Poland on 1 May 1945, and was also made a Commander of the Legion of Merit by the United States, and a Grand Officer of both the Belgian Order of the Crown and the Czechoslovakian Order of the White Lion. In July 1948 he was awarded the King Haakon VII Freedom Cross by the King of Norway &quot;in recognition of distinguished services rendered in the cause of the Allies&quot;.

==Post-war career==
Leckie retired from the Royal Canadian Air Force on 1 September 1947, though he continued to take an interest in aviation, serving as a special consultant to the Air Cadet League.

Air Marshal Leckie died on 31 March 1975, the last surviving wartime Chief of the Air Staff, aged 84. He was survived by his widow, Bernice, and two sons.

Leckie was inducted into the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988.

<doc id="397758" wikidata="Q745090" url="?curid=397758" title="Alignment (role-playing games)">
<text>In some role-playing games (RPGs), alignment is a categorization of the moral and ethical perspective of the player characters, non-player characters, monsters, and societies in the game. Not all role-playing games have such a system, and some narrativist role-players consider such a restriction on their characters&#x27; outlook on life to be overly constraining. However, some regard a concept of alignment to be essential to role-playing, since they regard role-playing as an exploration of the themes of good and evil. A basic distinction can be made between alignment typologies, based on one or more sets of systematic moral categories, and mechanics that either assign characters a degree of adherence to a single set of ethical characteristics or allow players to incorporate a wide range of motivations and personality characteristics into gameplay.

==Alignment typologies==
===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
The original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D) game created a three-alignment system of law, neutrality and chaos. In &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, this became a two-dimensional grid, one axis of which measures a &quot;moral&quot; continuum between good and evil, and the other &quot;ethical&quot; between law and chaos, with a middle ground of &quot;neutrality&quot; on both axes for those who are indifferent, committed to balance, or lacking the capacity to judge. This system was retained more or less unchanged through the 2nd and 3rd editions of the game. By combining the two axes, any given character has one of nine possible alignments:

Neutral in this scheme can be one of two versions: Neutral, those who have no interest in (or no ability to care about) the choice between Good and Evil or Law and Chaos; or &quot;True Neutral&quot;, meaning those who not only actively remain neutral but believe it is necessary to enforce the balance of the world on others, and would act in any required fashion to bring about that balance. According to Ian Livingstone, alignment is &quot;often criticized as being arbitrary and unreal, but... it works if played well and provides a useful structural framework on which not only characters but governments and worlds can be moulded.&quot;

In the 4th edition of the game, the alignment system was simplified, reducing the number of alignments to five. The 5th edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; returned to the previous two-axis system. However, it also decoupled alignment from most of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game mechanics; instead, alignment in this edition is more of a flexible roleplaying guide.

===&quot;Warhammer FRP&quot;===
&quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&quot; originally used a linear five-place system: Law – Good – Neutral – Evil – Chaos. In changes of alignment (for whatever reason) a character moved one place along to the next position (e.g.: a neutral character could move to good or evil but not to chaotic).

In practice, the system was used to regulate reactions between characters of different alignments.

In the newer edition, the concept of alignment (and the presence of Law as the antithesis of Chaos) has been discarded, with more emphasis on the personalities and unique natures of characters, rather than a linear alignment system.

===&quot;Palladium&quot;===
&quot;Palladium&quot; uses a system where alignments are described in detailed terms of how a character acts in a certain situation: whether they will lie, how much force they will use against innocents, how they view the law, and so on. The alignments are organized into three broad categories: Good, Selfish, and Evil. The seven core alignments are Principled (Good), Scrupulous (Good), Unprincipled (Selfish), Anarchist (Selfish), Aberrant (Evil), Miscreant (Evil), and Diabolic (Evil). An eighth alignment, Taoist, was introduced in the Mystic China supplement, but has not seen wide use.

Each category contains answers to a set of questions on moral behaviours. For example, given the question &quot;Would you keep a wallet full of cash you found?&quot;, most selfish or evil alignments would keep it, while most good alignments would seek to return the wallet to its owner. The categories are not organized into a pattern like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The system specifically does not include any sort of &quot;neutral&quot; alignment on the grounds that a neutral point of view is antithetical to the active role heroes and villains should play in a story.

===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
The alignments of the &quot;Wizards of the Coast Star Wars Roleplaying Game&quot; are limited to &quot;light side&quot; and &quot;dark side&quot;, though there are variations within these.

In the older West End Games version of the game, behaviour is controlled with Force points which indicate one use of it per point. When using The Force for evil deeds, the character gains a Dark Side point which can accumulate and put the character at risk of being turned to the Dark Side at a periodic die role, at which point the player loses control of their character and becomes a non-player villain character. By contrast, heroic deeds using The Force allow the player to remove the point. In addition, using The Force heroically at a dramatically appropriate moment, such as Luke Skywalker firing his proton torpedoes in the Death Star&#x27;s exhaust port in the Battle of Yavin, enables the player to not only regain the force point but also gain another.

==Other mechanics for character motivation and ethics==
===&quot;World of Darkness&quot;===
Characters in White Wolf&#x27;s old &quot;World of Darkness&quot; (WoD) games have &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Demeanour&quot; characteristics that describe how the characters really are and how they behave superficially. The Nature and Demeanour are freeform, allowing players to create new types.

Additionally, in White Wolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and derivatives (such as &quot;Ghouls: Fatal Addiction&quot;), vampire and human characters may have a &quot;Humanity&quot; trait ranging from 0 to 10. The higher levels are the compassionate and humane while the lower levels are psychopathic (further enhanced by the predatory nature of the vampire psyche). The average non-magic human has a Humanity score of about 7 or 8. Other &quot;paths&quot; (moral philosophies) were created for vampire types. The path mechanic was sharply criticized for providing an &quot;out&quot; for gamers to avoid having to pay in-game penalties for actions which would exact them from a character on the humanity path. Kindred of the East provided a system for &quot;dharmas&quot; which superficially resembled path mechanics, but was meant to represent the character&#x27;s mastery of an occult philosophy rather than to gauge its moral state.

This has changed with the re-imagining of the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; setting. In the new editions of the White Wolf games (new &quot;World of Darkness&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, etc.), all characters have a morality trait ranked from 0 to 10, though what it is called varies from game to game, and what sorts of behaviour will raise or lower it depend on the character type as well (in &quot;Vampire: The Requiem&quot; it is still called &quot;humanity&quot; and is affected by the same behaviours). In addition to this, all characters have a &quot;virtue&quot; and a &quot;vice&quot; based upon the traditional seven of each, which represents their major (though not only) vice and virtue. This is intended to illustrate that even the very good are never perfect, although characters with a score closer to 10 will be much more capable of avoiding evil behaviour while characters of lower moral tone will begin to care less about such and simply revel in being wicked.
Additionally, unlike &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in which every character is subject to at least a cursory moral classification, not all &quot;World of Darkness&quot; characters are subject to morality. Some beings, such as very old and very powerful Spirits (like the Idigam), or entities from the Abyss (like the Acamoth) are beyond manifest conception and thus are outside any measure of useful definition.

Unlike the majority of other role-playing games, the World of Darkness &quot;alignment&quot; system is meant not to reflect philosophical convictions about &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;wrong&#x27;, which are left entirely up to the creator of the character. Instead, they represent the generalities of the character&#x27;s state of mind. Believing in or adhering to a certain set of abstract moralisms is not considered to be as strong a motivating factor as the concrete conditions of what a character&#x27;s personality may bring them to do. While philosophical moralism may play a strong role in a character&#x27;s thought, lifestyle, and development, these may be violated with only minor to moderate repercussions, depending on the situation, while striking out against a character&#x27;s basic temperament carries strong psychological consequences, and the behaviour of comprehensively changing a character&#x27;s disposition takes a great deal of time and diligence. This system was designed specifically by White Wolf in order to avoid having characters pigeonholed as stereotypical heroes and villains who are often driven by beliefs so strong they seem to be psychic imperatives. It was created with the goal in mind of enforcing the moral and ethical &#x27;grey area&#x27; within which the World of Darkness setting as a whole resides, and generating focus around the struggle of each character throughout the Chronicle (WoD Campaign) to reconcile their personality with their beliefs and the situations which test them.

===&quot;d20 Modern&quot;===
&quot;d20 Modern&quot; uses &quot;allegiance&quot;, an ordered list of groups and ideals the character is aligned with, ranked in approximate order of increasing priority. Characters&#x27; allegiances determine a &#x27;rule of thumb&#x27; for their reactions to situations, in that they will generally favour the interests or outlook of their highest allegiance, or their next where the first does not apply. This generally allows for snap-decisions on moral or ethical questions, in keeping with the rapid pace of gameplay.

===&quot;DC Heroes&quot;===
&quot;DC Heroes&quot; from Mayfair Games (now known as MEGS, Mayfair Exponential Game System) used the characteristic &quot;motivation&quot; to describe a character&#x27;s ethical behaviour. This is selected from a list divided into &quot;heroic&quot; (upholding the good, responsibility of power, seeking justice, thrill of adventure, and unwanted power) and &quot;villainous&quot; (mercenary, thrill seeker, psychopath, power lust, and nihilist). In the MEGS licensed game Blood of Heroes by Pulsar Games, a set of &quot;anti-heroic&quot; variations on some of the heroic and villainous motivations were presented, allowing characters to exist in moral and ethical gray areas.

To enforce the motivations, players are awarded or deducted character points, which have various uses, depending on their actions. For instance, good characters are awarded points for good and heroic behaviour while evil behaviour can cost them.

===&quot;GURPS&quot;===
&quot;GURPS&quot; uses &quot;mental disadvantages&quot; to model the personality of character (&quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; personality traits are disadvantages because they limit or impose behaviour). Mental disadvantages include ordinary personality traits (honest, curious, shy, bad temper), phobias (scotophobia, triskaidekaphobia), mental illnesses (delusions, hallucinations, manic depression), and various self- or externally imposed behaviours (vow, code of honour, addiction). Characters gain extra development points by taking disadvantages, allowing them to buy more advantages and skills. However, only the extremes of behaviour are defined as strong disadvantages, while normal predilections and preferences are referred to as &quot;quirks&quot;. Also, if a normally-disadvantageous personality trait is used for a character in a game where it would actually be advantageous, it is termed an advantage and costs points.

===&quot;Unknown Armies&quot;===
Characters in &quot;Unknown Armies&quot; (UA) have &quot;passions&quot;: specific stimuli that bring out certain behaviours and reflect the character&#x27;s deepest personality traits. Every character has one &quot;fear passion&quot; that gives the character a bonus chance to escape a specific kind of frightening stimulus, one &quot;rage passion&quot; that helps the character lash out against a particular frustrating stimulus, and one &quot;noble passion&quot; that provides a bonus to selfless behaviour for the sake of some greater cause. Passions are invented freeform during character creation, but each fear passion is tied to one of the five types of psychological stress in UA: violence, helplessness, isolation, self, or the unnatural.

===Alternate methods===
Some games have used other methods to encourage certain behaviours. For instance, superhero games like &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; and &quot;DC Heroes&quot; each have points that players could earn with heroic behaviour or lose with inappropriate actions. Given that these points could be used to improve their characters, or affect dice roll results in their favour, the players have an incentive to have their characters behave heroically and morally to earn them. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; RPG by West End Games uses the rules governing the use of the Force for the same purpose.

<text>Following the defeat of Nazi Germany and then the partition of German territory, two Four-Power Authorities, in which the four main victor nations (the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and France) managed equally, were created.

The intended governing body of Germany until it could run itself was called the [[Allied Control Council]]. The commanders-in-chief exercised supreme authority in their respective zones and acted in concert on questions affecting the whole country. The capital Berlin, which lay in the Soviet sector, was also divided into four sectors.

Only two jointly run four-power organizations survived the division of Germany. Both were in West Berlin, Germany, and existed during the Cold War from 1948 to 1989. These were the Berlin Air Safety Centre and Spandau Prison (which was demolished in 1987 when Rudolf Hess, the sole remaining prisoner, died).

==Status==
These two organisations were uniquely four-powered in that American, British, French, and Soviet authorities cooperated in their management. This was different from the intensely adversarial relations the allies had with the Warsaw Pact leader in almost every other aspect of world affairs during this time. Both organisations remained low-profile and secretive during their existences to avoid highlighting the politically sensitive nature of their interactions and co-operation.

<text>Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enables communication between two electronic devices over a distance of or less. NFC offers a low-speed connection through a simple setup that can be used for the bootstrapping of capable wireless connections. Like other proximity card technologies, NFC is based on inductive coupling between two electromagnetic coils present on a NFC-enabled device such as a smartphone. NFC communicating in one or both directions uses a frequency of 13.56 MHz in the globally available unlicensed radio frequency ISM band, compliant with the ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface standard at data rates ranging from 106 to 848 kbit/s.

The NFC Forum has helped define and promote the technology, setting standards for certifying device compliance. Secure communications are available by applying encryption algorithms as is done for credit cards and if they fit the criteria for being considered a personal area network.

== NFC standards ==
NFC standards cover communications protocols and data exchange formats and are based on existing radio-frequency identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa. The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC Forum. In addition to the NFC Forum, the GSMA group defined a platform for the deployment of GSMA NFC Standards within mobile handsets. GSMA&#x27;s efforts include Trusted Services Manager, Single Wire Protocol, testing/certification and secure element. NFC-enabled portable devices can be provided with application software, for example to read electronic tags or make payments when connected to an NFC-compliant system. These are standardized to NFC protocols, replacing proprietary technologies used by earlier systems.

A patent licensing program for NFC is under deployment by France Brevets, a patent fund created in 2011. This program was under development by Via Licensing Corporation, an independent subsidiary of Dolby Laboratories, and was terminated in May 2012. A platform-independent free and open source NFC library, , is available under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

Present and anticipated applications include contactless transactions, data exchange and simplified setup of more complex communications such as Wi-Fi. In addition, when one of the connected devices has Internet connectivity, the other can exchange data with online services.

=== NFC wireless charging (WLC) ===

Near-field communication (NFC) technology not only supports data transmission but also enables wireless charging, providing a dual-functionality that is particularly beneficial for small, portable devices. The NFC Forum has developed a specific wireless charging specification, known as NFC Wireless Charging (WLC), which allows devices to charge with up to 1W of power over distances of up to . This capability is especially suitable for smaller devices like earbuds, wearables, and other compact Internet of Things (IoT) appliances.

Compared to the more widely known Qi wireless charging standard by the Wireless Power Consortium, which offers up to 15W of power over distances up to , NFC WLC provides a lower power output but benefits from a significantly smaller antenna size. This makes NFC WLC an ideal solution for devices where space is at a premium and high power charging is less critical.

The NFC Forum also facilitates a certification program, labeled as Test Release 13.1 (TR13.1), ensuring that products adhere to the WLC 2.0 specification. This certification aims to establish trust and consistency across NFC implementations, minimizing risks for manufacturers and providing assurance to consumers about the reliability and functionality of their NFC-enabled wireless charging devices.

== History ==
NFC is rooted in radio-frequency identification technology (known as RFID) which allows compatible hardware to both supply power to and communicate with an otherwise unpowered and passive electronic tag using radio waves. This is used for identification, authentication and tracking. Similar ideas in advertising and industrial applications were not generally successful commercially, outpaced by technologies such as QR codes, barcodes and UHF RFID tags.

Ultra-wideband (UWB) another radio technology has been hailed as a future possible alternatives to NFC technology due to further distances of data transmission, as well as Bluetooth and wireless technology.

== Design ==
NFC is a set of short-range wireless technologies, typically requiring a separation of or less. NFC operates at 13.56 MHz on ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface and at rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s. NFC always involves an initiator and a target; the initiator actively generates an RF field that can power a passive target. This enables NFC targets to take very simple form factors such as unpowered tags, stickers, key fobs, or cards. NFC peer-to-peer communication is possible, provided both devices are powered.

NFC tags contain data and are typically read-only, but may be writable. They can be custom-encoded by their manufacturers or use NFC Forum specifications. The tags can securely store personal data such as debit and credit card information, loyalty program data, PINs and networking contacts, among other information. The NFC Forum defines five types of tags that provide different communication speeds and capabilities in terms of configurability, memory, security, data retention and write endurance.

As with proximity card technology, NFC uses inductive coupling between two nearby loop antennas effectively forming an air-core transformer. Because the distances involved are tiny compared to the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) of that frequency (about 22 metres), the interaction is described as near field. An alternating magnetic field is the main coupling factor and almost no power is radiated in the form of radio waves (which are electromagnetic waves, also involving an oscillating electric field); that minimises interference between such devices and any radio communications at the same frequency or with other NFC devices much beyond its intended range. NFC operates within the globally available and unlicensed radio frequency ISM band of 13.56 MHz. Most of the RF energy is concentrated in the ±7 kHz bandwidth allocated for that band, but the emission&#x27;s spectral width can be as wide as 1.8 MHz in order to support high data rates.

Working distance with compact standard antennas and realistic power levels could be up to about (but practically speaking, working distances never exceed ). Note that because the pickup antenna may be quenched in an eddy current by nearby metallic surfaces, the tags may require a minimum separation from such surfaces.

The ISO/IEC 18092 standard supports data rates of 106, 212 or 424 kbit/s.

The communication takes place between an active &quot;initiator&quot; device and a target device which may either be:

; Passive: The initiator device provides a carrier field and the target device, acting as a transponder, communicates by modulating the incident field. In this mode, the target device may draw its operating power from the initiator-provided magnetic field.
; Active: Both initiator and target device communicate by alternately generating their own fields. A device stops transmitting in order to receive data from the other. This mode requires that both devices include power supplies.

NFC employs two different codings to transfer data. If an active device transfers data at 106 kbit/s, a modified Miller coding with 100 percent modulation is used. In all other cases Manchester coding is used with a modulation ratio of 10 percent.

Every active NFC device can work in one or more of three modes:

; NFC card emulation: Enables NFC-enabled devices such as smartphones to act like smart cards, allowing users to perform transactions such as payment or ticketing. See Host card emulation
; NFC reader/writer: Enables NFC-enabled devices to read information stored on inexpensive NFC tags embedded in labels or smart posters.
; NFC peer-to-peer:Enables two NFC-enabled devices to communicate with each other to exchange information in an ad hoc fashion.

NFC tags are passive data stores which can be read, and under some circumstances written to, by an NFC device. They typically contain data ( between 96 and 8,192 bytes) and are read-only in normal use, but may be rewritable. Applications include secure personal data storage (e.g. debit or credit card information, loyalty program data, personal identification numbers (PINs), contacts). NFC tags can be custom-encoded by their manufacturers or use the industry specifications.

== Security ==
Although the range of NFC is limited to a few centimeters, standard plain NFC is not protected against eavesdropping and can be vulnerable to data modifications. Applications may use higher-layer cryptographic protocols to establish a secure channel.

The RF signal for the wireless data transfer can be picked up with antennas. The distance from which an attacker is able to eavesdrop the RF signal depends on multiple parameters, but is typically less than 10 meters. Also, eavesdropping is highly affected by the communication mode. A passive device that doesn&#x27;t generate its own RF field is much harder to eavesdrop on than an active device. An attacker can typically eavesdrop within 10 m of an active device and 1 m for passive devices.

Because NFC devices usually include ISO/IEC 14443 protocols, relay attacks are feasible. For this attack the adversary forwards the request of the reader to the victim and relays its answer to the reader in real time, pretending to be the owner of the victim&#x27;s smart card. This is similar to a man-in-the-middle attack. One code example demonstrates a relay attack using two stock commercial NFC devices. This attack can be implemented using only two NFC-enabled mobile phones.

== Standards ==

NFC standards cover communications protocols and data exchange formats, and are based on existing RFID standards including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa. The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC Forum.

=== ISO/IEC ===
NFC is standardized in ECMA-340 and ISO/IEC 18092. These standards specify the modulation schemes, coding, transfer speeds and frame format of the RF interface of NFC devices, as well as initialization schemes and conditions required for data collision-control during initialization for both passive and active NFC modes. They also define the transport protocol, including protocol activation and data-exchange methods. The air interface for NFC is standardized in:

* ISO/IEC 18092 / ECMA-340—&quot;Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol-1&quot; (NFCIP-1)
* ISO/IEC 21481 / ECMA-352—&quot;Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol-2&quot; (NFCIP-2)

NFC incorporates a variety of existing standards including ISO/IEC 14443 Type A and Type B, and FeliCa (also simply named F or NFC-F). NFC-enabled phones work at a basic level with existing readers. In &quot;card emulation mode&quot; an NFC device should transmit, at a minimum, a unique ID number to a reader. In addition, NFC Forum defined a common data format called &quot;NFC Data Exchange Format&quot; (NDEF) that can store and transport items ranging from any MIME-typed object to ultra-short RTD-documents, such as URLs. The NFC Forum added the &quot;Simple NDEF Exchange Protocol&quot; (SNEP) to the spec that allows sending and receiving messages between two NFC devices.

=== GSMA ===
The GSM Association (GSMA) is a trade association representing nearly 800 mobile telephony operators and more than 200 product and service companies across 219 countries. Many of its members have led NFC trials and are preparing services for commercial launch.

GSM is involved with several initiatives:

* Standards: GSMA is developing certification and testing standards to ensure global interoperability of NFC services.
* &quot;Pay-Buy-Mobile initiative&quot;: Seeks to define a common global approach to using NFC technology to link mobile devices with payment and contactless systems.
* On November 17, 2010, after two years of discussions, AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile launched a joint venture to develop a platform through which point of sale payments could be made using NFC in cell phones. Initially known as Isis Mobile Wallet and later as Softcard, the venture was designed to usher in broad deployment of NFC technology, allowing their customers&#x27; NFC-enabled cell phones to function similarly to credit cards throughout the US. Following an agreement with—and IP purchase by—Google, the Softcard payment system was shuttered in March, 2015, with an endorsement for its earlier rival, Google Wallet.

=== StoLPaN ===
StoLPaN (Store Logistics and Payment with NFC) is a pan-European consortium supported by the European Commission&#x27;s Information Society Technologies program. StoLPaN will examine the potential for NFC local wireless mobile communication.

=== NFC Forum ===

NFC Forum is a non-profit industry association formed on March 18, 2004, by NXP Semiconductors, Sony and Nokia to advance the use of NFC wireless interaction in consumer electronics, mobile devices and PCs. Its specifications include the five distinct tag types that provide different communication speeds and capabilities covering flexibility, memory, security, data retention and write endurance. NFC Forum promotes implementation and standardization of NFC technology to ensure interoperability between devices and services. As of January 2020, the NFC Forum had over 120 member companies.

NFC Forum promotes NFC and certifies device compliance and whether it fits in a personal area network.

=== Other standardization bodies ===
GSMA defined a platform for the deployment of GSMA NFC Standards within mobile handsets. GSMA&#x27;s efforts include, Single Wire Protocol, testing and certification and secure element. The GSMA standards surrounding the deployment of NFC protocols (governed by NFC Forum) on mobile handsets are neither exclusive nor universally accepted. For example, Google&#x27;s deployment of Host Card Emulation on Android KitKat provides for software control of a universal radio. In this HCE Deployment the NFC protocol is leveraged without the GSMA standards.

Other standardization bodies involved in NFC include:

* ETSI / SCP (Smart Card Platform) to specify the interface between the SIM card and the NFC chipset.
* EMVCo for the impacts on the EMV payment applications

== Applications ==
NFC allows one- and two-way communication between endpoints, suitable for many applications.

NFC devices can act as electronic identity documents and keycards. They are used in contactless payment systems and allow mobile payment replacing or supplementing systems such as credit cards and electronic ticket smart cards. These are sometimes called &quot;NFC/CTLS&quot; or &quot;CTLS NFC&quot;, with &quot;contactless&quot; abbreviated as &quot;CTLS&quot;. NFC can be used to share small files such as contacts and for bootstrapping fast connections to share larger media such as photos, videos, and other files.

=== Commerce ===
NFC devices can be used in contactless payment systems, similar to those used in credit cards and electronic ticket smart cards, and allow mobile payment to replace/supplement these systems.

In Android 4.4, Google introduced platform support for secure NFC-based transactions through Host Card Emulation (HCE), for payments, loyalty programs, card access, transit passes and other custom services. HCE allows any Android 4.4 app to emulate an NFC smart card, letting users initiate transactions with their device. Apps can use a new Reader Mode to act as readers for HCE cards and other NFC-based transactions.

On September 9, 2014, Apple announced support for NFC-powered transactions as part of Apple Pay. With the introduction of iOS 11, Apple devices allow third-party developers to read data from NFC tags.

As of 2022, there are five major NFC apps available in the UK: Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Barclays Contactless Mobile and Fitbit Pay. The UK Finance&#x27;s UK Payment Markets Summary 2021 looked at Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay and found 17.3 million UK adults had registered for mobile payment (up 75% from the year before) and of those, 84% had made a mobile payment.

=== Bootstrapping other connections ===
NFC offers a low-speed connection with simple setup that can be used to bootstrap more capable wireless connections. For example, Android Beam software uses NFC to enable pairing and establish a Bluetooth connection when doing a file transfer and then disabling Bluetooth on both devices upon completion. Nokia, Samsung, BlackBerry and Sony have used NFC technology to pair Bluetooth headsets, media players and speakers with one tap. The same principle can be applied to the configuration of Wi-Fi networks. Samsung Galaxy devices have a feature named S-Beam—an extension of Android Beam that uses NFC (to share MAC address and IP addresses) and then uses Wi-Fi Direct to share files and documents. The advantage of using Wi-Fi Direct over Bluetooth is that it permits much faster data transfers, running up to 300 Mbit/s.

=== Social networking ===
NFC can be used for social networking, for sharing contacts, text messages and forums, links to photos, videos or files and entering multiplayer mobile games.

=== Identity and access tokens ===
NFC-enabled devices can act as electronic identity documents found in passports and ID cards, and keycards for the use in fare cards, transit passes, login cards, car keys and access badges . NFC&#x27;s short range and encryption support make it more suitable than less private RFID systems.

=== Smartphone automation and NFC tags ===
NFC-equipped smartphones can be paired with NFC Tags or stickers that can be programmed by NFC apps. These programs can allow a change of phone settings, texting, app launching, or command execution.

Such apps do not rely on a company or manufacturer, but can be utilized immediately with an NFC-equipped smartphone and an NFC tag.

The NFC Forum published the Signature Record Type Definition (RTD) 2.0 in 2015 to add integrity and authenticity for NFC Tags. This specification allows an NFC device to verify tag data and identify the tag author.

=== Gaming ===

NFC has been used in video games starting with &quot;&quot;. These are customizable figurines which contain personal data with each figure, so no two figures are exactly alike. Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U GamePad was the first console system to include NFC technology out of the box. It was later included in the Nintendo 3DS range (being built into the New Nintendo 3DS/XL and in a separately sold reader which uses Infrared to communicate to older 3DS family consoles) and the Nintendo Switch range (being built within the right Joy-Con controller and directly in the Nintendo Switch Lite). The amiibo range of accessories utilize NFC technology to unlock features.

=== Sports ===
Adidas Telstar 18 is a soccer ball that contains an NFC chip within. The chip enables users to interact with the ball using a smartphone.

== Bluetooth comparison ==
NFC and Bluetooth are both relatively short-range communication technologies available on mobile phones. NFC operates at slower speeds than Bluetooth and has a much shorter range, but consumes far less power and doesn&#x27;t require pairing.

NFC sets up more quickly than standard Bluetooth, but has a lower transfer rate than Bluetooth low energy. With NFC, instead of performing manual configurations to identify devices, the connection between two NFC devices is automatically established in less than .1 second. The maximum data transfer rate of NFC (424 kbit/s) is slower than that of Bluetooth V2.1 (2.1 Mbit/s).

NFC&#x27;s maximum working distance of less than reduces the likelihood of unwanted interception, making it particularly suitable for crowded areas that complicate correlating a signal with its transmitting physical device (and by extension, its user).

NFC is compatible with existing passive RFID (13.56 MHz ISO/IEC 18000-3) infrastructures. It requires comparatively low power, similar to the Bluetooth V4.0 low-energy protocol. However, when NFC works with an unpowered device (e.g. on a phone that may be turned off, a contactless smart credit card, a smart poster), the NFC power consumption is greater than that of Bluetooth V4.0 Low Energy, since illuminating the passive tag needs extra power.

== Devices ==

In 2011, handset vendors released more than 40 NFC-enabled handsets with the Android mobile operating system. BlackBerry devices support NFC using BlackBerry Tag on devices running BlackBerry OS 7.0 and greater.

MasterCard added further NFC support for PayPass for the Android and BlackBerry platforms, enabling PayPass users to make payments using their Android or BlackBerry smartphones. A partnership between Samsung and Visa added a &#x27;payWave&#x27; application on the Galaxy S4 smartphone.

In 2012, Microsoft added native NFC functionality in their mobile OS with Windows Phone 8, as well as the Windows 8 operating system. Microsoft provides the &quot;Wallet hub&quot; in Windows Phone 8 for NFC payment, and can integrate multiple NFC payment services within a single application.

In 2014, iPhone 6 was released from Apple to support NFC. and since September 2019 in iOS 13 Apple now allows NFC tags to be read out as well as labeled using an NFC app.

== Deployments ==

As of April 2011 hundreds of NFC trials had been conducted. Some firms moved to full-scale service deployments, spanning one or more countries. Multi-country deployments include Orange&#x27;s rollout of NFC technology to banks, retailers, transport, and service providers in multiple European countries, and Airtel Africa and Oberthur Technologies deploying to 15 countries throughout Africa.

* China Telecom (China&#x27;s 3rd largest mobile operator) made its NFC rollout in November 2013. The company signed up multiple banks to make their payment apps available on its SIM Cards. China telecom stated that the wallet would support coupons, membership cards, fuel cards and boarding passes. The company planned to achieve targets of rolling out 40 NFC phone models and 30 Mn NFC SIMs by 2014.
* Softcard (formerly Isis Mobile Wallet), a joint venture from Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, focuses on in-store payments making use of NFC technology. After doing pilots in some regions, they launched across the US.
* Vodafone launched the NFC-based Vodafone SmartPass mobile payment service in Spain in partnership with Visa. It enables consumers with an NFC-enabled SIM card in a mobile device to make contactless payments via their SmartPass credit balance at any POS.
* OTI, an Israeli company that designs and develops contactless microprocessor-based smart card technology, contracted to supply NFC-readers to one of its channel partners in the US. The partner was required to buy $10MM worth of OTI NFC readers over 3 years.
* Rogers Communications launched virtual wallet Suretap to enable users to make payments with their phone in Canada in April 2014. Suretap users can load up gift cards and prepaid MasterCards from national retailers.
* Sri Lanka&#x27;s first workforce smart card uses NFC.
* As of December 13, 2013 Tim Hortons TimmyME BlackBerry 10 Application allowed users to link their prepaid Tim Card to the app, allowing payment by tapping the NFC-enabled device to a standard contactless terminal.
* Google Wallet allows consumers to store credit card and store loyalty card information in a virtual wallet and then use an NFC-enabled device at terminals that also accept MasterCard PayPass transactions.
* Germany, Austria, Finland, New Zealand, Italy, Iran, Turkey and Greece trialed NFC ticketing systems for public transport. The Lithuanian capital of Vilnius fully replaced paper tickets for public transportation with ISO/IEC 14443 Type A cards on July 1, 2013. 
* NFC sticker-based payments in Australia&#x27;s Bankmecu and card issuer Cuscal completed an NFC payment sticker trial, enabling consumers to make contactless payments at Visa payWave terminals using a smart sticker stuck to their phone.
* India was implementing NFC-based transactions in box offices for ticketing purposes.
* A partnership of Google and Equity Bank in Kenya introduced NFC payment systems for public transport in the Capital city Nairobi under the branding BebaPay.
* January 2019 saw the start of trial using NFC-enabled Android mobile phones to pay public transport fares in Victoria, Australia.

<text>Gordon is a surname with multiple origins, especially Scottish. The masculine given name &quot;Gordon&quot; is derived from the surname.

==Origin of the surname==
The Scottish surname &quot;Gordon&quot; may be derived from several locations. One possibility is from Gordon, in Berwickshire. Another possibility is from a similarly named place in Normandy. The English surname &quot;Gordon&quot; is derived from the placename of Gourdon, in Saône-et-Loire, France. This location is derived from the Gallo-Roman personal name &quot;Gordus&quot;. In Ireland, the surname &quot;Gordon&quot; is of several origins. One origin of the surname is from the Scottish surname, which spread into Ireland in the 17th century during the plantation era; in the Irish language this name is spelt &quot;de Górdún&quot;. Also, the surname &quot;Gordon&quot; is an Anglicised form of the Irish language &quot;Mag Mhuirneacháin&quot;, which is a patronymic form of the personal name &quot;Muirneachán&quot;. This personal name is derived from the Irish language word &quot;muirneach&quot;, meaning &quot;beloved&quot;. Another origin of the Irish name Gordon is as an Anglicised form of the Irish language surname &quot;Mórbhoirneach&quot;.

&quot;Gordon&quot; ( ) is also a Jewish surname, likely derived from the city of Grodno, in Belarus—thus, of an origin completely unrelated to the British surname though spelled the same in English.

The Spanish, and Galician surname &quot;Gordón&quot; is derived from places like-named in the Spanish and Galician languages. The Basque language &quot;Gordon&quot; is also derived from a like-named placename. Another origin for the Spanish surname is from the nickname &quot;Gordo&quot;, which is derived from the Spanish language word &quot;gordo&quot;, meaning &quot;fat&quot;.

Gordon is also a British Romany surname with origins on the Scottish-English Border; during the 17th and 18th century fearing persecution many Gypsy folk in the North of England and the South of Scotland chose to change their surnames to blend into the local societies they were living within. These Gordons are completely unrelated to other ancestral sources of the name.

They were widely used as textbooks in American schools from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, and are still used today in some private schools and homeschooling.

The editors of the Readers were brothers William Holmes McGuffey and Alexander Hamilton McGuffey. William created the first four readers and Alexander McGuffey created the fifth and sixth reader. About 120 million copies of McGuffey&#x27;s Readers were sold between 1836 and 1960, placing its sales in a category with the &quot;Bible&quot; and &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. Since 1961, they have continued to sell at a rate of some 30,000 copies a year. Only the &quot;Ray&#x27;s Arithmetic&quot; series (1834–1913) matched it in popularity, written by a colleague of McGuffey&#x27;s and begun in 1834.

==Publication==
William Holmes McGuffey established a reputation as a lecturer on moral and biblical subjects while he was teaching at Miami University. In 1835, the small Cincinnati publishing firm of Truman and Smith asked him to create a series of four graded readers for primary level students. He had been recommended for the job by longtime friend Harriet Beecher Stowe. He completed the first two readers within a year of signing his contract, receiving a fee of $1,000 ($ in 2024 dollars). He compiled the first four readers (1836–1837 edition), while the fifth and sixth were created by his brother Alexander Hamilton McGuffey during the 1840s. The series consisted of stories, poems, essays, and speeches. The advanced Readers contained excerpts from the works of well-regarded English and American writers and politicians such as Lord Byron, John Milton, and Daniel Webster.

Most schools of the 19th century used only the first two in the series of McGuffey&#x27;s four readers. The first Reader taught reading by using the phonics method, the identification of letters and their arrangement into words, and aided with slate work. The second Reader was used once students could read. It helped them to understand the meaning of sentences, while providing vivid stories which children could remember. The third Reader taught the definitions of words and was written at a level equivalent to the modern 5th or 6th grade. The fourth Reader was written for the highest levels of ability on the grammar school level.

McGuffey&#x27;s Readers were among the first textbooks in the United States designed to be increasingly challenging with each volume. They used word repetition in the text as a learning tool, developing reading skills by challenging students using the books. Sounding-out, enunciation, and accents were emphasized. Colonial-era texts had offered dull lists of 20 to 100 new words per page for memorization. In contrast, McGuffey used new vocabulary words in the context of real literature, gradually introducing new words and carefully repeating the old.

McGuffey believed that teachers, as well as their students, should study the lessons and suggested that they read aloud to their classes. He also listed questions after each story, for he believed that asking questions was critical for a teacher to give instruction. The Readers emphasized spelling, vocabulary, and formal public speaking, which was a more common requirement in 19th-century America than today.

McGuffey is remembered as a conservative theological teacher. He interpreted the goals of public schooling in terms of moral and spiritual education, and attempted to give schools a curriculum that would instill Presbyterian Calvinist beliefs and manners in their students. These goals were considered suitable for the relatively homogeneous America of the early- to mid-19th century, though they were less so for the increasingly pluralistic society that developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

The content of the readers changed drastically between McGuffey&#x27;s 1836–1837 edition and the 1879 edition. The revised Readers were compiled to meet the needs of national unity and the dream of an American melting pot for the world&#x27;s masses. The Calvinist values of salvation, righteousness, and piety were excluded from the later versions, though they had been prominent in the early Readers. The content of the books was secularized and replaced by middle-class civil religion, morality, and values. McGuffey&#x27;s name was featured on these revised editions, yet he neither contributed to them nor approved their content.

Other types of schoolbooks gradually replaced McGuffey&#x27;s in the academic marketplace. The desire for distinct grade levels and less overtly religious content, and the greater profitability of consumable workbooks all helped to bring about their decline. McGuffey&#x27;s Readers never entirely disappeared, however. Reprinted versions of his Readers are still in print, and may be purchased in bookstores across the country. Today, McGuffey&#x27;s Readers are popular among homeschoolers and in some Protestant religious schools.

== Influence ==
Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Ron Powers notes that the Readers affected the first mass-educated and mass-literate generation in the modern world. The books made Shakespeare&#x27;s plays widely known in America. Author Hamlin Garland said &quot;I got my first taste of Shakespeare from the selected scenes which I read in these books.&quot; Students were encouraged to memorize, and read aloud, classic orations such as &quot;Antony&#x27;s Oration over Dead Caesar&#x27;s Body&quot; and &quot;Henry V. to His Troops.&quot; Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies were represented by &quot;The Hamlet Soliloquy. &quot; The McGuffey canon contributed to an American belief in Shakespeare&#x27;s authority as second only to the Bible. 

Industrialist Henry Ford cited McGuffey&#x27;s Readers as one of his most important childhood influences. Otherwise Ford was poorly educated and read little. He was an avid fan of McGuffey&#x27;s Readers first editions. Ford republished all six Readers from the 1867 edition and donated complete sets of them to schools across the United States. In 1934, Ford had the log cabin where McGuffey was born moved to Greenfield Village, Ford&#x27;s museum of Americana at Dearborn, Michigan. In 1936, Ford sponsored a collection of excerpts from McGuffey Readers.

American composer Burrill Phillips composed a work entitled &quot;Selections from McGuffey&#x27;s Reader&quot;, for orchestra, based on poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. It was completed in 1933.

In the late 20th century many evangelical homeschooling parents used the &quot;McGuffey Readers&quot; to recapture 19th century conservative values for their children.

<doc id="397803" wikidata="Q351331" url="?curid=397803" title="Product stewardship">
<text>Product stewardship is an approach to managing the environmental impacts of different products and materials and at different stages in their production, use and disposal. It acknowledges that those involved in producing, selling, using and disposing of products have a shared responsibility to ensure that those products or materials are managed in a way that reduces their impact, throughout their lifecycle, on the environment and on human health and safety. This approach focusses on the product itself, and everyone involved in the lifespan of the product is called upon to take up responsibility to reduce its environmental, health, and safety impacts.

For manufacturers, this includes planning for, and if necessary, paying for the recycling or disposal of the product at the end of its useful life. This may be achieved, in part, by redesigning products to use fewer harmful substances, to be more durable, reusable and recyclable, and to make products from recycled materials. For retailers and consumers, this means taking an active role in ensuring the proper disposal or recycling of an end-of-life product.

Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process. It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) &quot;commodity&quot; and &quot;product&quot; relationships.

The most familiar example is the container-deposit legislation. A fee is paid to buy the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains. If the bottle is returned, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or recycling. If not, the collected fee can be used to pay for landfill or litter control measures. Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving: this is quite common, for instance, among homeless people in U.S. cities.

However, the principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires. When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become. In some countries, such as Germany, law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way. This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally. In the United States, the issue has been confronted via class action lawsuits that attempt to hold companies liable for the environmental impact of their products. Thus far, such as litigation or proposed accounting reforms such as full cost accounting have not gained much traction for the product stewardship concept in the United States beyond the realm of academe and corporate public relations (derisively referred to as greenwashing).

The demand-side approach ethical consumerism, supported by consumer education and information about environmental impacts, may approach some of the same outcomes as product stewardship.

== Certified Professional Product Steward ==
Product stewardship professionals can seek certification as a Certified Professional Product Steward (CPPS) from the Board for Global EHS Credentialing. The CPPS is the first credential of its kind, providing product stewards with the opportunity to distinguish their expertise and build professional credibility within the field.

== Legislation ==
Australia&#x27;s Product Stewardship Act 2011 provides a framework for managing the environmental, health and safety impacts of products, and in particular those impacts associated with the disposal of products and their associated waste. The framework includes voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship. The passage of the legislation is said to have delivered on a key commitment by the Australian Government under the National Waste Policy, which was agreed by Australian state governments in November 2009 and endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in October 2010.

The Act supports the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme (NTCRS) through the Product Stewardship (Televisions and Computers) Regulations 2011. The scheme has recycled approximately 230,000 tonnes of electronic waste since its inception. This review is an important opportunity to continue to update and improve the NTCRS.

The Minister’s Product List is established by the Act, and is updated annually. The list informs the community and industry of those products being considered for accreditation or regulation under the Act.

A review of the Act was mandated to take place five years after implementation, and this was initiated in March 2018.

==Extended producer responsibility==
Product Stewardship is often used interchangeably with extended producer responsibility, a similar concept. However, there are distinct differences between the two, as suggested by the semantics of the different terms used.

While both concepts bring the onus of waste management for end-of-life products from the government to the manufacturers, Product Stewardship further extends this responsibility to everyone involved in the life-cycle of the product—not only manufacturers, but also retailers, consumers and recyclers.

<doc id="397810" wikidata="Q207939" url="?curid=397810" title="Alexander McQueen">
<text>Lee Alexander McQueen (17 March 1969 – 11 February 2010) was a British fashion designer and couturier. He founded his own Alexander McQueen label in 1992, and was chief designer at Givenchy from 1996 to 2001. His achievements in fashion earned him four British Designer of the Year awards (1996, 1997, 2001 and 2003), as well as the Council of Fashion Designers of America International Designer of the Year award in 2003. McQueen died by suicide in 2010 at the age of 40, at his home in Mayfair, London, shortly after the death of his mother.

McQueen had a background in tailoring before he studied fashion and embarked on a career as a designer. His MA graduation collection caught the attention of the fashion editor Isabella Blow, who became his patron. McQueen&#x27;s early designs, particularly the radically low-cut &quot;bumster&quot; trousers, gained him recognition as an &quot;enfant terrible&quot; in British fashion. In 2000 McQueen sold 51% of his company to the Gucci Group, which established boutiques for his label worldwide and expanded its product range. During his career, he designed a total of 36 collections for his brand, including his graduation collection and unfinished final collection. Following his death, his longtime collaborator Sarah Burton took over as creative director of his label.

As a designer, McQueen was known for sharp tailoring, historicism, and imaginative designs that often verged into the controversial. He explored themes such as romanticism, sexuality, and death, and many collections had autobiographical elements. Among his best-known individual designs are the bumsters, the skull scarf, and the armadillo shoes. McQueen&#x27;s catwalk shows were noted for their drama and theatricality, and they often ended with elements of performance art, such as a model being spray painted by robots (&quot;No. 13&quot;, Spring/Summer 1999), or a life-size illusion of Kate Moss (&quot;The Widows of Culloden&quot;, Autumn/Winter 2006).

McQueen&#x27;s legacy in fashion and culture is extensive. His designs were showcased in two retrospective exhibitions: &quot;Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty&quot; (2011 and 2015) and &quot;Lee Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse&quot; (2022). He remains the subject of journalistic and academic analysis, including the book &quot;Gods and Kings&quot; (2015) by fashion journalist Dana Thomas and the documentary film &quot;McQueen&quot; (2018).

==Early life==
Lee Alexander McQueen was born on 17 March 1969 at University Hospital Lewisham in Lewisham, London, to Ronald and Joyce McQueen, the youngest of six children. His Scottish father worked as a taxi driver, whereas his mother was a social science teacher. It was reported that he grew up in a council flat, but, in fact, the McQueens moved to a terraced house in Stratford in his first year. McQueen attended Carpenters Road Primary School, before going to Rokeby School.

He was interested in clothes from a young age. As the youngest of six children, McQueen began experimenting with fashion by making dresses for his three sisters. His earliest fashion memory reaches back to when he was just three years old, drawing a dress on the wall of his East London family home. He was also fascinated by birds and was a member of the Young Ornithologists&#x27; Club; later, in his professional career, he often used birds as motifs in his designs.

==Career==
===Early years===

McQueen left school aged 16 in 1985 with only one O-level in art and took a course in tailoring at Newham College. He went on to serve a two-year apprenticeship in coat-making with Savile Row tailors Anderson &amp; Sheppard before joining Gieves &amp; Hawkes as a pattern cutter for a short time. The skills he learned as an apprentice on Savile Row helped earn him a reputation in the fashion world as an expert in creating an impeccably tailored look. McQueen later claimed that he had sewed obscenities into the lining of suits made for Prince Charles, although a recall of suits made by Anderson &amp; Sheppard to check found no evidence of this.

After Savile Row, he worked briefly for the theatrical costumiers Angels and Bermans, making costumes for shows such as &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. In 1989, at the age of 20, he was hired by experimental Mayfair-based designer Koji Tatsuno. He first worked as a pattern cutter before moving into clothing production. Shortly after, he moved to fashion label Red or Dead, working under designer John McKitterick; here he gained experience with fetishwear. When McKitterick left Red or Dead in early 1990 to launch his own label, he hired McQueen. By this time, McQueen was interested in becoming a designer himself, and McKitterick recommended he try for an apprenticeship in Italy, then the centre of the fashion world.

In spring 1990, McQueen left for Milan, Italy. He had no standing job offer, but secured a position with Romeo Gigli on the basis of his portfolio and tailoring experience. He resigned from Gigli&#x27;s studio in July 1990, and had returned to London – and McKitterick&#x27;s label – by August that year.

=== Central Saint Martins ===

McQueen was still hungry to learn more about designing clothes, so McKitterick suggested he see Bobby Hillson, the Head of the MA course in fashion at London art school Central Saint Martins (CSM). McQueen turned up at CSM with a pile of sample clothing and no appointment, seeking a job teaching pattern cutting. Hillson considered him too young for this, but based on the strength of his portfolio, and despite his lack of formal qualifications, accepted McQueen into the 18-month master&#x27;s-level fashion design course. Unable to afford the tuition, he borrowed £4,000 from his aunt Renee to cover it.

McQueen started at CSM in October 1990. He met a number of his future collaborators there, including Simon Ungless, a friend and later room-mate, and Fleet Bigwood, a print tutor at the school. McQueen received his master&#x27;s degree in fashion design after presenting his graduation collection at London Fashion Week in March 1992. The collection, titled &quot;Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims&quot;, was bought in its entirety by magazine editor Isabella Blow. Through the early days of McQueen&#x27;s career, Isabella Blow helped pave the way using her unique style and contacts to help McQueen. She was in many ways his mentor, which grew into a close friendship.

Blow was said to have persuaded McQueen to use his middle name Alexander when he subsequently launched his fashion career. Another suggestion was that he used his middle name so as not to lose his unemployment benefits for which he was registered while still a struggling young designer under the name of Lee McQueen. McQueen had said that he refused to be photographed in his early career because he did not want to be recognized in the dole office. In the 2018 documentary &quot;McQueen&quot;, his boyfriend and assistant designer in the early days, Andrew Groves, said that McQueen dictated that they could only show him from behind to avoid being identified and losing his unemployment benefitshis only significant means of income at that time.

===Own label===
In 1992, McQueen started his own label, and for a time he lived in the basement of Blow&#x27;s house in Belgravia while it was under renovation. In 1993, he relocated to Hoxton Square, an area that also housed other new designers including Hussein Chalayan and Pauric Sweeney. His first post-graduation collection, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (Autumn/Winter 1993), was inspired by the 1976 Martin Scorsese film of the same name. It was presented during London Fashion Week in March 1993 on a clothes rack in a small room at the Ritz Hotel. McQueen was one of six young designers sponsored by the British Fashion Council that season. &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; saw the introduction of the &quot;bumster&quot;, an extreme low-rise trouser which McQueen returned to again and again. With this collection, McQueen began his early practice of sewing locks of his own hair in perspex onto the clothes to serve as his label. When the exhibit closed, McQueen packed the items into bin bags and headed out clubbing. He stashed the bags behind one club, started drinking, and promptly forgot about them. When he returned the next day, the entire collection was gone. Nothing remains of the collection.

===Early runway shows===

McQueen&#x27;s first professional runway show in 1993, the Spring/Summer 1994&#x27;s &quot;Nihilism&quot; collection, was held at the Bluebird Garage in Chelsea. His early runway collections developed his reputation for controversy and shock tactics, earning him monikers like &quot;enfant terrible&quot; and &quot;the hooligan of English fashion&quot;. McQueen&#x27;s &quot;Nihilism&quot; collection, with some models looking bruised and bloodied in see-through clothes and extremely low-cut bumster trousers, was described by journalist Marion Hume of &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;theatre of cruelty&quot; and &quot;a horror show&quot;.

McQueen&#x27;s second runway show was for the &quot;Banshee&quot; collection. Shortly after creating this collection. McQueen met Katy England, his soon to be &quot;right hand woman&quot;, outside a &quot;high profile fashion show&quot; trying to &quot;blag her way in&quot;. He asked her to join him as creative director for his following collection, &quot;The Birds&quot;; she worked with McQueen for many years, serving as his &quot;second opinion&quot;. &quot;The Birds&quot;, which was named after the 1963 Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;The Birds&quot; and held at Kings Cross, had a roadkill theme featuring clothes with tyre marks and the corsetier Mr Pearl in an 18-inch waist corset.

McQueen&#x27;s &quot;bumsters&quot; were a common feature of his early shows. Although derided by some and attracting many comments and debate, it spawned a trend in low-rise jeans, especially after Madonna wore a pair in an MTV advert in 1994. Michael Oliveira-Salac, the director of Blow PR and a friend of McQueen&#x27;s said, &quot;The bumster for me is what defined McQueen.&quot;

===Mainstream publicity===

Although McQueen had found some success with &quot;The Birds&quot;, it was his controversial sixth collection, &quot;Highland Rape&quot; (Autumn/Winter 1995), that properly made his name. The collection was inspired by Scottish history, particularly the Highland Clearances of the late 18th and 19th centuries. Styling at the runway show was violent and aggressive: many of the showpieces were slashed or torn, while others were spattered with bleach or fake blood. Reviewers interpreted it as being about women who were raped and criticised what they saw as misogyny and the glamorisation of rape. McQueen denied this, arguing that it referred to &quot;England&#x27;s rape of Scotland&quot;, and was intended to counter other designers&#x27; romantic depiction of Scottish culture. As for the charge of misogyny, he said he aimed to empower women and for people to be afraid of the women he dressed.

McQueen followed &quot;Highland Rape&quot; with &quot;The Hunger&quot; (Spring/Summer 1996) and &quot;Dante&quot; (Autumn/Winter 1996). &quot;Dante&quot; further raised his international profile, and the collection was shown twice; first in Christ Church, Spitalfields, London, later in a disused synagogue in New York, both attended by large enthusiastic crowds. McQueen won his first British Designer of the Year award in 1996.

McQueen&#x27;s increasing prominence led to a number of projects for music artists. In 1996, he designed the wardrobe for David Bowie&#x27;s tour of 1997, such as the Union Jack coat worn by Bowie on the cover of his album &quot;Earthling&quot;. Icelandic singer Björk sought McQueen&#x27;s work for the cover of her album &quot;Homogenic&quot; in 1997. McQueen also directed the music video for her song &quot;Alarm Call&quot; from the same album and later contributed the iconic topless dress to her video for &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot;.

McQueen continued to be criticised for misogyny in some of his later shows for designs that some considered degrading to women. In &quot;Bellmer&quot; &quot;La Poupée&quot; (Spring/Summer 1997), inspired by Hans Bellmer&#x27;s &quot;The Doll&quot;, McQueen placed models including the black model Debra Shaw in metal restraints, which observers interpreted as a reference to slavery, while the silver mouthpiece in &quot;Eshu&quot; (Autumn/Winter 2000) forced the wearer to bare her teeth. Similarly the sex-doll lips make-up of the models in &quot;The Horn of Plenty&quot; (Autumn/Winter 2009–10) was also criticised as being ugly and misogynistic. The fashion writer of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; called McQueen &quot;the designer who hates women&quot;.

===Givenchy appointment===

McQueen was appointed head designer of Givenchy in 1996 to succeed John Galliano who had moved to Dior. Hubert de Givenchy, founder of the label known for its elegant couture, criticised McQueen&#x27;s appointment, describing it as a &quot;total disaster&quot;. In turn, upon his arrival at Givenchy, McQueen insulted the founder by calling him &quot;irrelevant&quot;. McQueen&#x27;s debut show for Givenchy, Spring/Summer 1997, featured Greek mythology-inspired gold and white designs. The collection was considered a failure by some critics in contrast to the praise lavished on John Galliano&#x27;s debut collection for Dior. McQueen himself said to &quot;Vogue&quot; in October 1997 that the collection was &quot;crap&quot;. McQueen had toned down his designs at Givenchy, although he continued to indulge his rebellious streak. Givenchy designs released by Vogue Patterns during this period may be credited to the late designer.

McQueen&#x27;s relationship with Givenchy was fraught, and he left in March 2001 after his contract ended, with McQueen arguing that Givenchy had started to &quot;constrain&quot; his creativity.

===&quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle out There&quot;===

Five weeks after his criticised debut for Givenchy, McQueen staged his own show entitled &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle Out There&quot;, which was inspired by nature. The title was a response to the criticism he received; according to McQueen, after he watched a nature documentary about gazelles being hunted by lions: That&#x27;s me!&#x27; Someone&#x27;s chasing me all the time, and, if I&#x27;m caught, they&#x27;ll pull me down. Fashion is a jungle full of nasty, bitchy hyenas.&quot; Models wore eye make-up to resemble gazelles and clothes with horns in the show. This collection, presented at London&#x27;s Borough Market, was judged a triumph. Amy Spindler of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who had criticised his Givenchy debut, wrote that McQueen was &quot;fashion&#x27;s closest thing to a rock star. He isn&#x27;t just part of the London scene; he is the scene.&quot; The London show restored his reputation and he went on to produce a number of well-received collections for Givenchy.

McQueen staged many of his shows in an unusual or dramatic fashion. His Spring/Summer 1998 &quot;Untitled&quot; collection (originally titled &quot;Golden Shower&quot; until the sponsor objected) was presented on a catwalk showered with water in yellow light, while the following &quot;Joan&quot; (after Joan of Arc) ended with a masked model standing in a ring of fire.

===&quot;No. 13&quot;===

McQueen&#x27;s Spring/Summer &#x27;99 collection &quot;No. 13&quot; (it was his 13th collection) was held in a warehouse in London on 27 September 1998 and received widespread media attention. It took inspiration from William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement, with its concern for handcraft. Some of the dresses incorporated Morris-inspired embroidery, and the show featured double amputee Aimee Mullins in a pair of prosthetic legs intricately hand-carved in ash. The finale of the show, however, provided a counter-point to the anti-industrial ethic of the Arts and Crafts movement. It featured Shalom Harlow in a white dress spray-painted in yellow and black by two robotic arms from a car manufacturing plant. It is considered one of the most memorable finales in fashion history.

McQueen&#x27;s following collection, &quot;The Overlook&quot; (Autumn/Winter 1999), was named after the Overlook Hotel from Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;The Shining&quot;. Inspired by the film&#x27;s winter setting, the runway show featured a winter scene with ice-skaters and presented clothes mostly in white and grey. A notable creation in the show was the coiled corset made in collaboration with jeweller Shaun Leane, who also crafted many other pieces for McQueen, including a Spine Corset (&quot;Untitled&quot; Spring/Summer 1998) and a yashmak in aluminium and crystal (&quot;Eye&quot;, Spring/Summer 2000). The coiled corset, an expansion of the idea of a coiled neck-piece made by Leane for &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle Out There&quot;, was made out of aluminium rings. It was sold in 2017 for $807,000.

McQueen held his first runway show in New York in 1999, titled &quot;Eye&quot; (Spring/Summer 2000). The theme was the West&#x27;s relationship with Islam and featured designs that were sexualised versions of traditional Islamic dress, which was poorly received by the critics. The show ended with models in niqāb and burqa floating above spikes that had appeared out of water.

===&quot;Voss&quot;===

One of McQueen&#x27;s most celebrated and dramatic catwalk shows was his 2001 Spring/Summer collection, named &quot;Voss&quot; after a Norwegian town known for its wildlife habitat. Nature was reflected in the natural material used in some of his clothes such as ostrich feathers, but more unusual were outfits made out of razor clam and mussel shells.

The centre piece tableau that dominated the show was an enormous dark glass box within a larger glass box. Inside the inner dark glass case was an interior filled with moths and, at the centre, a naked model on a chaise longue with her face obscured by a gas mask. The tableau was revealed when the glass walls of the inner box fell away towards the end of the show and smashed onto the ground. McQueen said that the tableau was based on the Joel Peter Witkin image &quot;Sanitarium&quot;. The model chosen by McQueen to be the centre of the show was the British writer Michelle Olley. The British fashion photographer Nick Knight said of the VOSS show on his SHOWstudio.com blog: &quot;It was probably one of the best pieces of Fashion Theatre I have ever witnessed.&quot;

Because the room outside the box was lit and the inside of the box was unlit before the show started, the glass walls appeared as large mirrors, so that the seated audience saw only their own reflection. Alexander McQueen later described his thoughts on the idea used during &quot;VOSS&quot; of forcing his audience to stare at their own reflection in the mirrored walls for over an hour before the show started:
===Gucci partnership===

Before his contract with Givenchy had finished, McQueen signed a deal with Givenchy&#x27;s rival Gucci in 2000, daring Givenchy to fire him. Gucci bought 51% of McQueen&#x27;s company with McQueen remaining its creative director, and the deal allowed McQueen to expand his own Alexander McQueen label. In the following years a number of Alexander McQueen boutiques opened in cities around the world, and the label also extended into perfume, eyewear and accessories, trainers, as well as a menswear line.

McQueen continued to present his runway shows in the unconventional manner for which he had become known. The Autumn 2001 show, his last show in London before moving to Paris, featured a merry-go-round with models in clown make-up dragging along a golden skeleton; the Autumn/Winter 2002 &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; collection was shown with live caged wolves and a black parachute cape inspired by Tim Burton; the Autumn/Winter 2003 &quot;Scanners&quot; was presented in a snowy wasteland setting with models walking along a wind tunnel; and the Autumn 2004 show was a re-enactment of dance scenes from Sydney Pollack&#x27;s film &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;, choreographed for the show by Michael Clark. For the spring 2005 &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Game&quot; collection, he presented a human chess game, and his autumn 2006 show &quot;The Widows of Culloden&quot;, featured a life-sized illusion of Kate Moss, an English supermodel, dressed in yards of rippling fabric.

McQueen also became known for using skulls in his designs. A scarf bearing the skull motif, which first appeared in the &quot;Irere&quot; Spring/Summer collection of 2003, became a celebrity must-have and was copied around the world.

Although McQueen had incorporated menswear into many of his previous catwalk shows, for example Spring/Summer &#x27;98, it was only in 2004 that a separate menswear collection was introduced with his first menswear runway show in Milan&#x27;s menswear event. He was named &quot;GQ&quot; magazine&#x27;s Designer of the Year in 2004.

In 2007, McQueen dedicated his Spring 2008 collection, &quot;La Dame Bleue&quot;, to Isabella Blow, who had died by suicide earlier that year. The show included works by his long-time collaborator Philip Treacy, another protégé of Blow. The collection had a bird theme and featured brightly coloured clothes with feathers.

McQueen produced a well-received collection, &quot;The Girl Who Lived in the Tree&quot;, for Autumn/Winter 2008. It was based on a story McQueen created about a feral girl who lived in a tree but transformed into a princess and married a prince to become a queen. He took inspiration from the queens of England and the British Raj and Empire to create a romantic and regal collection. The first half of the show focused on dark decorative dresses over petticoats, which became lighter and more lavish in the second half.

The Spring/Summer 2009 collection, &quot;Natural Dis-tinction Un-natural Selection&quot;, was inspired by Charles Darwin who was the &#x27;creator&#x27; of the theory of natural selection, and the influence of the industrial revolution on nature. It was presented on a runway filled with taxidermied animals. The show presented structured clothes that featured prints with images of natural materials, as well as crystal-encrusted bodysuits and bell jar-shaped dresses.

In 2009, McQueen also collaborated with dancer Sylvie Guillem, director Robert Lepage and choreographer Russell Maliphant, designing the wardrobe for the theatre show &quot;Eonnagata&quot;, which premiered at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in London.

===&quot;Plato&#x27;s Atlantis&quot; ===

Alexander McQueen&#x27;s last appearance on a fashion show was in &quot;Plato&#x27;s Atlantis&quot;, presented during Paris Fashion Week on 6 October 2009. This Spring/Summer 2010 collection was inspired by nature and the post-human manifesto featuring 46 full looks depicted with sea creature and reptile prints. McQueen installed two large cameras on the runway, both of which moved back and forth, documenting and broadcasting the entire show live on SHOWstudio. &quot;Plato&#x27;s Atlantis&quot; was the first fashion show by any designer to be streamed live over the internet, although the website streaming it crashed after Lady Gaga tweeted about the show before it started.

The show began with a video of Raquel Zimmermann lying naked on sand with snakes on her body. The fashion show and the collection addresses Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution as well as current global warming issues. The fantasy collection, named after Plato&#x27;s island that sank into the sea, envisaged a future where humans are forced to evolve from living on land to living in water in order to survive. The colour scheme changed during the show from green and brown (land) to blue and aqua (ocean). The models exhibited an androgynous look (which represents McQueen&#x27;s evolutionary themes), as well as possessing post-human characteristics. The prints shifted from reptilian to prints of water creatures such as jellyfish and stingrays. The collection&#x27;s final silhouettes gave the models marine features while the McQueen&#x27;s signature armadillo shoe also transformed the appearance of the models&#x27; anatomic foot. Plato&#x27;s Atlantis was yet another way in which McQueen fused fashion with technology. The finale of the show was accompanied by the debut of Lady Gaga&#x27;s single &quot;Bad Romance&quot;.

===Final show===

At the time of Alexander McQueen&#x27;s death, he had 16 pieces for his Autumn/Winter collection that were 80% finished. These outfits were completed by his design team, and shown in seven presentations to small, specially invited groups. This collection, unofficially titled &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;, was first shown during Paris Fashion Week on 8 March 2010, to a select handful of fashion editors in a mirrored, gilded salon at the 18th-century Hôtel de Clermont-Tonnerre. Some fashion editors said the show was hard to watch because it showed how McQueen was obsessed with the afterlife.

The clothes presented had a medieval and religious look. Basic colours that were repetitively used were red, gold, and silver with detailed embroidery. The last outfit presented had a coat made of gold feathers (shown left). His models were accessorized to show his love for theatrical imagery. &quot;Each piece is unique, as was he,&quot; McQueen&#x27;s fashion house said in a statement that was released with the collection.

After company owner Gucci confirmed that the brand would continue, McQueen&#x27;s long-time assistant Sarah Burton was named as the new creative director of Alexander McQueen in May 2010. In September 2010, Burton presented her first womenswear collection in Paris.

==Accomplishments==

Some of McQueen&#x27;s accomplishments included being one of the youngest designers to achieve the title &quot;British Designer of the Year&quot;, which he won four times between 1996 and 2003; he was also appointed a CBE and named International Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers in 2003.

McQueen has been credited with bringing drama and extravagance to the catwalk. He used new technology and innovation to add a different twist to his shows and often shocked and surprised audiences. The silhouettes that he created have been credited with adding a sense of fantasy and rebellion to fashion.

===Company===

December 2000 saw a new partnership for McQueen, with the Gucci Group acquiring 51% of his company and McQueen serving as creative director. Plans for expansion included the opening of stores in London, Milan and New York, and the launch of his perfumes Kingdom and, most recently, My Queen. In 2005, McQueen collaborated with Puma to create a special line of trainers for the shoe brand. In 2006 he launched McQ, a younger, more renegade lower-priced line for men and women. Among his most popular design is the skull scarf first created in 2003.

By the end of 2007, Alexander McQueen had boutiques in London, New York, Los Angeles, Milan and Las Vegas. Celebrity patrons, including Nicole Kidman, Penélope Cruz, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Rihanna, Monica Brown and J-pop queens, such as Ayumi Hamasaki, Namie Amuro, and Koda Kumi, have frequently been spotted wearing McQueen clothing to events. The number of McQueen stores worldwide had increased to 100 by the end of 2020, with revenues estimated to be €500m in 2020.

McQueen became one of several designers to participate in MAC&#x27;s promotion of cosmetic releases created by fashion designers. The collection was released on 11 October 2007 and reflected the looks used on the Autumn/Winter McQueen catwalk created by make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury. The inspiration for the collection was the 1963 Elizabeth Taylor movie &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, and thus the models sported intense blue, green, and teal eyes with strong black liner extended Ancient Egyptian–style. McQueen handpicked the makeup.

===Collections===

During his career, McQueen designed 36 womenswear collections under his eponymous fashion label, including his graduate school collection and his unfinished final collection. In his earlier collections, he sometimes presented menswear or had male models walk in the shows, but his label did not have a regular menswear line until 2004.

==Popular culture==
McQueen created custom designs for music artists David Bowie and Björk, which were used in their album covers and tours. Lady Gaga wore several McQueen designs, including the final outfit from &quot;Plato&#x27;s Atlantis&quot;, in her video for &quot;Bad Romance&quot;.

A leather costume designed by McQueen was worn by Janet Jackson in her halftime show at Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, which created a controversy when her breast was briefly exposed in an incident described by Justin Timberlake as a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;.

==Personal life==
McQueen was openly gay and said he realised his sexual orientation when he was six years old. He told his family when he was 18 and, after a rocky period, they accepted it. He described coming out at a young age by saying, &quot;I was sure of myself and my sexuality and I&#x27;ve got nothing to hide. I went straight from my mother&#x27;s womb onto the gay parade&quot;.

In 2000, McQueen had a marriage ceremony with his partner George Forsyth, a documentary filmmaker, on a yacht in Ibiza. Kate Moss and Annabelle Neilson were bridesmaids. The marriage was not official, as same-sex marriage in Spain only became legal in 2005. The relationship ended a year later, with the two maintaining a close friendship.

Later in life, he revealed to his family that he had been sexually abused by his brother-in-law when he was young.

McQueen was HIV positive.

McQueen was an avid scuba diver and used his passion as a source of inspiration in his designs, including spring 2010&#x27;s &quot;Plato&#x27;s Atlantis&quot;. Much of his diving was done around the Maldives.

McQueen received press attention after the May 2007 suicide of magazine editor Isabella Blow. Rumours were published that there was a rift between McQueen and Blow at the time of her death, focusing on McQueen&#x27;s under-appreciation of Blow. McQueen denied these rumours.

==Death and memorial==

On the morning of 11 February 2010, McQueen&#x27;s housekeeper found that he had hung himself at his home in Green Street, London. Paramedics were called and they pronounced him dead at the scene. He was 40 years old.

The coroner, Paul Knapman, reported finding &quot;a significant level of cocaine, sleeping pills, and tranquillisers in the blood samples taken after the designer&#x27;s death.&quot; The Westminster Coroner&#x27;s Court officially recorded his death as a suicide on 28 April 2010.

McQueen&#x27;s friend David LaChapelle said that at the time of his death, he &quot;was doing a lot of drugs and was very unhappy&quot;. McQueen&#x27;s mother had died eight days before he killed himself.

McQueen&#x27;s funeral took place on 25 February 2010 at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge, West London. His ashes were later scattered in Skye at Kilmuir, as his Skye ancestry had been a strong influence in his life and work.

A memorial was held for McQueen at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 20 September 2010. It was attended by 2,500 invited guests, including Björk, Kate Moss, Sarah Jessica Parker, Naomi Campbell, Stella McCartney, Daphne Guinness, Sam Taylor-Johnson, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Lady Gaga and Anna Wintour. Björk, a close friend of McQueen&#x27;s, performed a version of &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; while dressed in a gown he had designed.

A week after his death, Gucci Group announced that the Alexander McQueen business would carry on without its founder and creative director.

The BBC reported that McQueen had reserved £50,000 of his wealth for his pet dogs so they could live in luxury for the rest of their lives. He also bequeathed £100,000 each to four charities; these include the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in South London, and the Blue Cross animal welfare charity in Burford, Oxfordshire.

==Legacy and tributes==
On 16 February 2010, pop musician and friend Lady Gaga performed an acoustic, jazz rendition of her hit single &quot;Telephone&quot; and segued into &quot;Dance in the Dark&quot; at the 2010 Brit Awards. During the performance, Gaga paid tribute to McQueen, by dedicating a song to him. She also commemorated McQueen after accepting her award for Best International Artist, Best International Female, and Best International Album. Gaga dedicated a song to him, titled &quot;Fashion of His Love&quot;, on the special edition of her third album, &quot;Born This Way&quot;. R&amp;B singer Monica dedicated her 2010 music video &quot;Everything To Me&quot; to McQueen. Various other musicians, who were friends and collaborators with McQueen, paid tribute following his death, including Kanye West, Courtney Love, and Katy Perry.

In March 2010, celebrities including Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Annabelle Neilson paid visual tribute to McQueen by wearing his distinctive &#x27;manta&#x27; dresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;tele 15/3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The &#x27;manta&#x27; dresses, inspired by a scuba-diving holiday McQueen took to the Maldives in 2009, came from McQueen&#x27;s &#x27;Plato&#x27;s Atlantis&#x27; collection of Spring–Summer 2010 which was at the time available to purchase. &#x27;Manta&#x27; dresses had been worn by celebrities such as Daphne Guinness, Noot Seear, Anna Paquin, and Lily Cole prior to his death, and following the announcement that he had died, remaining stocks sold out despite prices starting at £2,800.

In 2012, McQueen was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires. McQueen is also given homage in the popular MMO &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. There is an NPC dedicated to Alexander McQueen that is a Tailoring Trainer named Alexandra McQueen. This trainer is also the only one on the horde side that gives a special quest Cloth Scavenging. A dress designed by McQueen featured on a commemorative UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail in 2012 celebrating Great British Fashion.

In 2016, a conceptual art piece made by Tina Gorjanc highlighted the possibility for corporations to copyright another human&#x27;s DNA. She created a series out of pig leather tanned and tattooed to appear similar to McQueen&#x27;s skin. She filed patents for her method of replicating McQueen&#x27;s skin in the lab, and displayed these patents along with the leather collection. McQueen&#x27;s family stated that they did not condone the use of his DNA for fashion projects but acknowledged that this project is exactly the sort of fashion experimentation he would have enjoyed.

=== Museum exhibitions ===

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City hosted a posthumous exhibition of McQueen&#x27;s work in 2011 titled &quot;Savage Beauty&quot;. The exhibition&#x27;s elaborate staging includes unique architectural finishes and soundtracks for each room. Despite being open for only three months, it was one of the most popular exhibitions in the museum&#x27;s history. The exhibition was so successful that Alexander McQueen fans and industry professionals worldwide began rallying at Change.org to &quot;Please Make Alexander McQueen&#x27;s Savage Beauty a Traveling Exhibition&quot; to bring honour to McQueen and see his vision become a reality: to share his work with the entire world. The exhibition then appeared in London&#x27;s Victoria &amp; Albert Museum between 14 March and 2 August 2015. It sold over 480,000 tickets, making it the most popular exhibition ever staged at that museum.

A second exhibition, &quot;Lee Alexander McQueen&quot;: &quot;Mind, Mythos, Muse&quot;, was staged at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Victoria in 2022. A version of this exhibition was also produced at the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec in 2023 under the name &quot;Lee Alexander McQueen&quot;: &quot;l&#x27;art rencontre la mode&quot;. It juxtaposed McQueen&#x27;s designs with art and objects from the museum&#x27;s collection to explore how McQueen&#x27;s body of work drew from diverse sources across art history.

=== In media ===

McQueen has been the subject of several books, both biographical and photographic. The first major biography was &quot;Blood Beneath the Skin&quot; (2015) by author Andrew Wilson. &quot;Gods and Kings&quot; (2015) by fashion journalist Dana Thomas discusses his life and work in conjunction with John Galliano, another controversial British designer of the 1990s.

In February 2015, on the fifth anniversary of McQueen&#x27;s death, the James Phillips play &quot;McQueen&quot; premiered. The play is set over one night in London and follows a girl who breaks into the designer&#x27;s home to steal a dress and is caught by McQueen. The production takes inspiration from his imaginative runway shows and was directed by John Caird. It has been described by McQueen&#x27;s sister Janet as &quot;true to his spirit&quot;. Stephen Wight and Dianna Agron played the leading roles.

In 2016, it was announced that Jack O&#x27;Connell would play McQueen in a biographical film based on &quot;Blood Beneath the Skin&quot;. English filmmaker Andrew Haigh was slated to direct. In 2017, both O&#x27;Connell and Haigh stated that they were no longer involved in the project.

On 8 June 2018, the documentary &quot;McQueen&quot;, written and directed by Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui, was released in the UK. It was described by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; as &quot;among the most accurate, sensitive, and moving. Using his collections as cornerstones, the documentary features candid interviews with colleagues, friends and even family of McQueen, who was known as Lee to the people he loved.&quot; The film was favourably reviewed, earning a score of 84 on the critical aggregator website Metacritic, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, as well as a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with a Critics Consensus reading, &quot;&quot;McQueen&quot; offers an intimate, well-sourced, and overall moving look at a young life and brilliant career that were tragically cut short.&quot;

<text>Donald Rogers Maynard (January 25, 1935 – January 10, 2022) was an American professional football player who was a wide receiver known for playing for the New York Jets in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL). He also played with the New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals; and the Shreveport Steamer of the World Football League (WFL).

Maynard was a four-time AFL All-Star and played for the Super Bowl III champions. The Jets retired Maynard&#x27;s No. 13 in his honor. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and included on the AFL All-Time Team.

Nicknamed &quot;Country&quot;, the quick and sure-handed Maynard was perhaps the most productive receiver of his day, setting career records for total receiving yards as well as yards per reception.

==Early life==
Maynard grew up in Texas. His father was a cotton broker, and with the family constantly moving, Maynard attended 13 schools, including five high schools. As a senior at Colorado City High School in Colorado City, Texas, he lettered in football, basketball, and track.

==College career==
Maynard played collegiately for Rice University (one year), then for Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso). In three seasons (1954–56) with the Miners, he caught only 28 passes but averaged 27.6 yards per reception and recorded 10 touchdowns. As a running back, he had 843 yards rushing on 154 attempts for a 5.4 average and also returned punts and kickoffs. He amassed 2,283 all-purpose yards, while also intercepting 10 passes playing defensive back.

==Professional career==
The New York Giants selected Maynard in the ninth round, with the 109th overall selection, of the 1957 NFL draft. In 12 games as a rookie, he had 12 rushes for 45 yards (3.8 yards per carry), caught five passes for 84 yards (a 16.8 yard average), and played on special teams. After being released by the Giants during their 1959 training camp, he played one game in the Canadian Football League with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, catching just one pass for 10 yards. In the off-season, he worked as a plumber and a teacher.

Maynard became the first player to sign with the New York Titans in 1960 (the team was renamed the Jets in 1963). This came about because the Titans&#x27; first head coach, Sammy Baugh, had coached against Maynard in college and knew his talent. Although scorned by the New York press as an &quot;NFL reject&quot; in 1960, he teamed with Art Powell to form the first professional wide receiver tandem to each gain over 1,000 yards on receptions in a season, with the pair achieving this milestone again in 1962. Over the next 13 years Maynard put up receiving numbers that would earn him a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987.

Collecting 72 pass receptions in his first year as a Titan, he went on to compile four more seasons with 50 or more catches and 1,000 yards receiving, and held the professional football record for total receptions and yards receiving. A four-time AFL All-Star, he is sixth in all-time pro football touchdown receptions, and is a member of the AFL All-Time Team.

In 1965, Maynard was teamed with rookie quarterback Joe Namath. Maynard had 1,218 yards on 68 receptions and 14 touchdowns in Namath&#x27;s first season (Namath had 22 touchdown passes that year). In 1967, Maynard caught 1,434 of Namath&#x27;s historic 4,007 passing yards. The receiving yards were a career-high for Maynard and led the league; he also had 71 receptions, 10 touchdowns, and averaged 20.2 yards per catch. In the 1968 season opener against Kansas City, Maynard had 200+ receiving yards for the first time in his career and passed Tommy McDonald as the active leader in receiving yards, where he remained for the next six seasons until his retirement. He added a career-best 228 yards in Game 10 against the Oakland Raiders. Maynard had 57 receptions for 1,297 yards (22.8 yards per catch) and 10 of Namath&#x27;s 15 touchdowns that year. In the 1968 AFL Championship Game, a 27–23 Jets victory over the Oakland Raiders, Maynard caught six passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns. His 14-yard catch in the first quarter gave the Jets the lead and his six-yard catch in the fourth quarter proved to be the game winner. The Jets won Super Bowl III, 16–7 over the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts, which was hailed as the first &quot;upset&quot; in Super Bowl history. Maynard played, but had no catches while suffering the effects of a hamstring injury in the AFL title game.

Maynard played four more seasons with the Jets after Super Bowl III including being named first-team all-Pro in 1969. But long-simmering tensions between him and Jets’ Coach Weeb Ewbank boiled over in 1973. He reported late to Jets&#x27; camp that summer and, six weeks later on September 10, Ewbank unceremoniously traded him to the St. Louis Cardinals for a future draft pick. He appeared in the Redbirds’ first two games for rookie head coach Don Coryell and caught one pass for 18 yards but didn&#x27;t play in the club&#x27;s next two contests and was released October 10. Two months later, on December 12, Maynard signed as a free agent with the playoff-bound Los Angeles Rams. The Rams were coached by Chuck Knox, who&#x27;d mentored the New York Jets&#x27; offensive line during four of Maynard&#x27;s prime seasons in Gotham – 1963-&#x27;66. The Rams, however, didn&#x27;t activate Maynard for their final game of that regular season nor their 27-16 divisional playoff loss to the Dallas Cowboys in Texas Stadium two days before Christmas.

His NFL playing career at an apparent end, the 39-year-old Maynard caught on with the Houston Texans / Shreveport Steamer of the embryonic World Football League the next summer. But he had just five receptions for the club, which was forced to abruptly move from Houston in September 1974 when Texans&#x27; owner R. Steven Arnold unloaded the financially floundering franchise on a group of investors from Shreveport, Louisiana. Maynard retired as an active player after that tumultuous season but was hired by the newly christened Steamer as their receivers&#x27; coach. Maynard remained in that role until the organization – and league – folded for good in October 1975.

As a player, Maynard did not wear a chin strap on his helmet, instead using special cheek inserts that held the helmet tightly in place.

One of only 20 players who were in the AFL for its entire 10-year existence, Maynard was also one of only seven players who played their entire AFL careers with one team. Maynard finished his career with 633 receptions for 11,834 yards and 88 touchdowns. His 18.7 yards per catch is the highest for anyone with at least 600 receptions. Maynard was the first receiver to reach 10,000 yards and retired as pro football&#x27;s all-time leader in receptions and yards receiving. Charley Taylor passed him in career receptions in 1975, while Maynard&#x27;s yardage mark stood until 1986, when Charlie Joiner surpassed him.

==Post-NFL career==

Following his NFL career, Maynard went on to participate in many charity-sponsored events. He also participated in the coin toss in Super Bowl XXXIII along with his former teammates, in honor of the 40th anniversary of the 1958 NFL Championship, which is also known as &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;. He was also once named the grand marshal in the annual El Paso Sun Bowl Thanksgiving Parade. He worked as a math and industrial arts teacher, sold a variety of products, and was a financial planner.

Later in his life, Maynard lived in both El Paso and in Ruidoso, New Mexico to be close to his son and daughter and two grandchildren. His son was also a coach in the Canadian Football League with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1990.

Maynard and his wife Marilyn (Weaver), whom he met when she was a student at Texas Western, were married in December 1955 after his junior season. She predeceased him. Maynard died from complications of dementia, among other ailments, at a care facility in Ruidoso on January 10, 2022, at the age of 86.

<text>Louis Maimbourg (; January 10, 1610, Nancy – August 13, 1686, Paris) was a French Jesuit and historian.

==Biography==
Born at Nancy, Maimbourg entered the Society of Jesus at the age of sixteen, and after studying at Rome became a classical master in the Jesuit college at Rouen. He afterwards devoted himself to preaching, but with only moderate success. After having taken some part in minor controversies he threw himself with energy into the dispute which had arisen as to the Gallican liberties; for his &quot;Traité historique de l&#x27;établissement et des prérogatives de l&#x27;Eglise de Rome et de ses évêques&quot; (1682) he was by command of Innocent XI expelled from the Society, but rewarded by Louis XIV with a residence at the abbey of St Victor, Paris, and a pension.

==Works==
His numerous works include histories of Arianism, the iconoclast controversy, the Great Schism of 1054, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, Calvinism, and of the pontificates of Leo I and Gregory I. These works are compilations, written in a very lively and attractive style, but noted for their inaccuracies.&quot;&quot; His work on the Crusades, &quot;Histoire des Croisades pour la délivrance de la Terre Sainte&quot; (1675), was a populist and royalist history of the Crusades from 1195 to 1220, and is regarded as the first use of the term &quot;crusade&quot;. It was translated into English in 1684 by historian John Nalson.&quot;&quot;His &quot;Histoire du calvinisme&quot; (1682) agitated French Catholics against French Protestants, provoking a ferocious response from Pierre Jurieu (1683) and a calm demolition of his historical method by Pierre Bayle in his &quot;Critique général de l’histoire du calvinisme de Maimbourg&quot; (1682).

<text>Bledlow is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Bledlow-cum-Saunderton, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is about west-southwest of Princes Risborough, and is on the county boundary with Oxfordshire. In 1931 the parish had a population of 925. On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Bledlow cum Saunderton&quot;.

The toponym &quot;Bledlow&quot; is derived from Old English and means &quot;Bledda&#x27;s burial mound&quot;. A 10th century document records it as &quot;Bleddanhloew&quot;; the Domesday Book of 1086 records it as &quot;Bledelai&quot;. A more common derivation is from &quot;Bled-Hlaw&quot; meaning Bloody Hill which commemorates an undated battle between Saxons and Danes.

==Geography==
The village is on the ancient Icknield Way and is where several springs form a small pool called the Lyde. The water from the springs is said to wear away the chalk on which the village stands, giving rise to the simple local medieval nursery rhyme:
The brook running from the pool into the nearby valley (called the Lyde Brook) provided water power for two watermills for many years. Bledlow&#x27;s watermill is a tourist attraction.

Above the village, carved into the chalk of Wain Hill is a large cross, similar to that found at Whiteleaf. There is also a round barrow on the hill. It is thought that this is the barrow or burial mound referred to in the village name.

Within the parish of Bledlow-cum-Saunderton are several hamlets. The main one is Bledlow Ridge. The others are Forty Green (not to be confused with Forty Green near Beaconsfield), Pitch Green, Rout&#x27;s Green, Skittle Green and Holly Green.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity overlooks the Vale of Aylesbury. It has two aisles and the nave arcades include capitals made in about 1200. Other features of interest are the font, some fragments of wall paintings, and the 13th- or 14th-century south doorway and porch. It is a Grade I listed building.

==Notable people==
Actress Samantha Eggar lived in Bledlow as a child, and was a neighbour of Oliver Reed while there.

==Transport==
Bledlow railway station was an intermediate station on the Wycombe Railway that served the village from 1862 to 1963. It was the first of two stations to serve the village, the second being on the Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway. It was to the south and closer to the village. It was opened in 1906 and closed in 1957. The potential for reopening the Wycombe Railway through Bledlow, which is now part of a long-distance footpath, was evaluated and dismissed by Chiltern Railways, the franchise holder for the Chiltern Main Line that runs through Princes Risborough.

<text>The Principality of Suzdal, from 1157 the Grand Principality of Vladimir, also known as Vladimir-Suzdal, or simply Suzdalia, was a medieval principality that was established during the disintegration of Kievan Rus&#x27;. In historiography, the territory of the grand principality and the principalities that emerged from it is commonly denoted as north-east Russia or north-east Rus″.

Yury Dolgoruky () moved his capital from Rostov to Suzdal in 1125, following the death of his father. He ruled a principality that had become virtually independent. His son Andrey () moved the capital to Vladimir and had Kiev sacked in 1169, leading to political power shifting to the north-east. Andrey&#x27;s younger brother Vsevolod III () secured control of the throne, and following his death, a dynastic conflict ensued. Yury II () was killed during the Mongol invasions of 1237–1238. His younger brother Yaroslav II () and the other princes submitted to Mongol rule.

By the end of the 13th century, the grand principality had fragmented into over a dozen appanages. Moscow and Tver emerged as the two leading principalities, leading to a struggle between them for possession of the grand princely throne. From 1331, the prince of Moscow was also the grand prince of Vladimir, except for one brief interruption from 1359 to 1363, when the throne was held by Nizhny Novgorod. In 1389, the grand principality became a family possession of the prince of Moscow and the two thrones were united. The original territory of the grand principality would later serve as the core of the Russian state.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The first known prince of Rostov mentioned in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; under the year 988 was Yaroslav Vladimirovich, appointed by his father Vladimir I of Kiev. In 1024, there was reportedly a famine in the area, and a revolt stoked up by pagan sorcerers was suppressed by Yaroslav personally. Upon his death in 1054, Vsevolod Yaroslavich received the lands of Rostov and Suzdal. Little is known about the region until the 1090s, except that the town of Yaroslavl had been founded upon the upper Volga by 1071, and that Vladimir Monomakh ordered a church to be built in Rostov. Bishops are recorded in the 1080s and 1090s, but the seat appears to have remained vacant for the next half-century. The 1097 Council of Liubech confirmed Vladimir Monomakh&#x27;s possession of Rostov and Suzdal. By the early 12th century, the towns of Rostov, Suzdal and Murom remained junior postings.

=== Rostov-Suzdal ===

At the 1097 Council of Liubech, Monomakh became prince of Pereyaslavl, including Rostov, for which he made an appanage for his sons. From that time onwards, the Rostov region was a point of contention between the Monomakhovichi of Pereyaslavl and the Sviatoslavichi of Murom. Control of the upper Volga river was particularly important, as it was the primary route for trade between Volga Bulgaria to the east and Veliky Novgorod to the west. Intercepting that commercial shipping for their own profit was tempting for the Monomakhovichi, but also risky, as it provoked hostilities with both the Bulgars and Novgorodians.

It seems that by the year 1108, Monomakh&#x27;s sixth son Yuri Dolgorukiy, who resided in the town of Suzdal&#x27;, was the prince of Rostov. In the same year, he supposedly founded the fortified outpost of Vladimir (&quot;Volodimer&quot;) on the Klyazma, to control that river and defend against raids of the Volga Bulgars who had attacked in 1107. In 1120, Yuri conducted a military campaign against Bolghar territory. 

During the 11th and 12th centuries when southern parts of Rus&#x27; were systematically raided by Turkic nomads, their inhabitants began to migrate northward. In the formerly wooded areas, known as Zalesye, many new settlements were established. The foundations of Pereslavl, Kostroma, Dmitrov, Moscow, Yuriev-Polsky, Uglich, Tver, Dubna, and many others were assigned (either by chronicle or popular legend) to G, whose sobriquet (&quot;the Long-Armed&quot;) alludes to his dexterity in manipulating the politics of far-away Kiev. Sometime in 1108 Monomakh strengthened and rebuilt the town of Vladimir on the Klyazma River, 31 km south of Suzdal. During the rule of Yuri, the principality gained military strength, and in the Suzdal-Ryazan war of 1146, it conquered the Ryazan Principality. Later in the 1150s, Yuri occupied Kiev a couple of times as well. From that time the lands of the northeastern Rus&#x27; played an important role in the politics of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

=== Rise of Vladimir ===
Yuri&#x27;s son Andrey Bogolyubsky significantly increased Vladimir&#x27;s power at the expense of the nearby princely states, which he treated with contempt. Unwilling to share power with his brothers and cousins, he drove them out and seized all their lands by 1162, thus uniting his father&#x27;s patrimony in Vladimir-Suzdal under his sole rule (&quot;samovlastets&quot;). When grand prince Rostislav I of Kiev died in 1167, a succession crisis broke out in which Andrey argued that, according to the emergent tradition of the Principality of Pereyaslavl being the domain of the crown prince of Kiev, his brother Gleb ought to be enthroned. After sacking Kiev in 1169, he enthroned his younger brother. Meanwhile, Andrey embellished Vladimir with white stone churches and monasteries. Gleb&#x27;s death in 1171 led to yet another succession crisis that saw the Suzdalians kicked out of Kiev; Andrey formed another coalition in an attempt to retake the capital, but was utterly defeated in the Siege of Vyshgorod (1173). The coalition fell apart, and some months later, prince Andrey was murdered by his own boyars in his suburban residence at Bogolyubovo in 1174.

During the 1174–1177 Suzdalian war of succession, Andrey&#x27;s brother Vsevolod III secured the throne of Vladimir, although the Yurievichi lost control of the Novgorod Republic for a decade. The Yurievichi clan also dropped out of the competition for the Kievan throne, never seeking it again, supporting Rurik Rostislavich&#x27;s accession in 1194. Instead, Vsevolod&#x27;s chief focus was on subjugating the southern Ryazan Principality, which appeared to stir discord in the princely family, and the mighty Turkic state of Volga Bulgaria, which bordered Vladimir-Suzdal to the east. After several military campaigns, Ryazan was burnt to the ground in 1208, and the Bulgars were forced to pay tribute.

=== Fragmentation ===

Vsevolod&#x27;s death in 1212 precipitated another serious dynastic conflict. His eldest son Konstantin gained the support of powerful Rostovan boyars and Mstislav the Bold of Kiev and expelled the lawful heir, his brother George, from Vladimir to Rostov. George managed to return to the capital six years later, upon Konstantin&#x27;s death. George proved to be a shrewd ruler who decisively defeated Volga Bulgaria and installed his brother Yaroslav in Novgorod. His reign, however, ended when the Mongol hordes under Batu Khan took and burnt Vladimir in 1238. Thereupon they proceeded to devastate other major cities of Vladimir-Suzdal during the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

=== Under Mongol suzerainty ===
While heavy tribute payments and the initial Mongol invasions did manage to cause much destruction to Vladimir-Suzdal, rule under the Mongols also brought wealth to the region, as Vladimir was able to access the Mongol&#x27;s lucrative patronage of oriental trade.

None of the cities of the principality managed to regain the power of Kievan Rus&#x27; after the Mongol invasion. Vladimir became a vassal of the Mongol Empire, later succeeded by the Golden Horde, with the Grand Prince appointed by the Great Khan. Even the popular Alexander Nevsky of Pereslavl had to go to the Khan&#x27;s capital in Karakorum to be installed as the Grand Prince in Vladimir. As many factions strove for power, the principality rapidly disintegrated into eleven tiny states: Moscow, Tver, Pereslavl, Rostov, Yaroslavl, Uglich, Belozersk, Kostroma, Nizhny Novgorod, Starodub-upon-Klyazma, and Yuriev-Polsky. All of them nominally acknowledged the suzerainty of the Grand Prince of Vladimir, but his effective authority became progressively weaker.

By the end of the century, only three cities — Moscow, Tver, and Nizhny Novgorod — still contended for the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir. Once installed, however, they chose to remain in their own cities rather than move to Vladimir. The Principality of Moscow gradually came to eclipse its rivals. The decision of metropolitan Peter of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; to move his chair from Vladimir to Moscow in 1325 was another sign of Moscow&#x27;s rising prominence. When the Tver Uprising of 1327 broke out, the Muscovites and Nizhegorodians helped the Mongols crush it. By the end of the 1330s, Moscow had eclipsed Tver, which then descended inter-princely wars between the various appanages of Tver, particularly between Kashin and Mikulin. During the Great Troubles, Tver and Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal both attempted to regain the title of grand prince of Vladimir, with Tver succeeding a few times, but since 1394, Moscow effectively inherited the title and controlled Vladimir thereafter, signifying the end of a separate Vladimirian principality.

== Culture ==
=== Suzdalian period ===
As part of the Christian world, Rus&#x27; principalities gained a wide range of opportunities for developing their political and cultural ties not only with Byzantium but with the European countries, as well. By the end of the eleventh century, Rus&#x27; gradually fell under the influence of Roman architecture. Whitestone cathedrals, decorated with sculpture, appeared in the principality of Vladimir-Suzdal due to Andrey Bogolyubsky&#x27;s invitation of architects from &quot;all over the world&quot;. These cathedrals, however, are not identical to the Roman edifices of Catholic Europe and represent a synthesis of the Byzantine cruciform plan and cupolas with Roman whitestone construction and decorative technique. This mixture of Greek and Western European traditions was possible only in Kievan Rus&#x27;. One of its results was a famous architectural masterpiece of Vladimir, the Church of Pokrova na Nerli, a symbol of cultural originality of Suzdalia.

In the early Middle Ages, Rus&#x27; principalities were similar to other European countries culturally and in historical development. Later on, however, the Rus&#x27; polities and Europe began diverging due to a number of factors. The East-West Schism of 1054 was one of the reasons for this. Barely noticeable in the eleventh century, it became very obvious two centuries later during the resistance of the citizens of Novgorod to the Teutonic Knights. Also, by the middle of the twelfth century, the dominating influence of the Kievan Rus’ (some historians do not consider it possible to even call it a state in the modern sense of the word) began to wane. The famous &quot;Theotokos of Vladimir&quot;, an icon of the Virgin Mary, was moved to Vladimir. From this time on, almost every principality began forming its own architectural and art schools.

The invasion of Batu Khan and subsequent domination of Rus&#x27; lands by the Golden Horde was also a turning point in the history of Russian culture and statehood. Mongol rule imposed its principles of state on the northeastern Rus&#x27; principalities, which were very different from those of Western Europe. In particular, Russia adopted a principle of universal subordination and undivided authority.

=== Muscovite period ===
Rus&#x27; was only able to recover from the consequences of the Mongol invasion by the late thirteenth century. The first areas to recover were Novgorod and Pskov, which had been spared the Tatar raids. These city-states, with parliamentarian rule, created an original kind of culture under some influence from their western Baltic neighbours. In the early fourteenth century, leadership in the northeastern lands was transferred from the Principality of Vladimir to Moscow, which, in turn, would fight for leadership against Tver for another century. Moscow was a part of the Vladimir lands and functioned as one of the border fortresses of north-eastern Rus&#x27;. In 1324, Metropolitan Peter left Vladimir and settled down in Moscow, thus, transferring the residence of the Russian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Maximus had moved the residence from Kiev to Vladimir not long before, in 1299). In the late fourteenth century, the principal object of worship of the &quot;old&quot; capital—the icon of the &quot;Theotokos of Vladimir&quot;—was transferred to Moscow. Vladimir became a model for Muscovy.

Emphasizing the succession, Muscovite princes took good care of Vladimir&#x27;s sacred places. In the early fifteenth century, Andrei Rublev and Prokhor of Gorodets painted the Assumption (Uspensky) Cathedral. In the mid-1450s, they restored the Cathedral of St. George in Yuriev-Polsky under the supervision of Vasili Dmitriyevich Yermolin. The architecture of Muscovy and its surrounding lands in the fourteenth to early fifteenth centuries, usually referred to as early Muscovite architecture, inherited the technique of whitestone construction and typology of four-pillar cathedrals from Vladimir. Art historians, however, notice that early Muscovite architecture was influenced by the Balkans and European Gothic architecture.

Russian painting of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries is characterized by two major influences, namely those of Byzantine artist Feofan Grek and Russian icon-painter Andrei Rublev. Feofan&#x27;s style is distinguished by its monochromatic palette and uncommon expressiveness of laconic blots and lines, which send a message of a complex symbolic implication, close to the then widely-spread doctrine of hesychasm, from Byzantium. The soft-coloured icons of Rublev are closer to the late Byzantine painting style of the Balkan countries in the fifteenth century.

The late fourteenth century was marked by one of the most important events in Russian history. In 1380, Dmitry Donskoy and his army dealt the first serious blow to the Golden Horde. Sergii Radonezhsky, the founder and hegumen of Troitse-Sergiyev monastery, played an exceptional role in this victory. The name of Saint Sergii, who became the protector and patron of Muscovy, has an enormous significance in Russian culture. Radonezhsky himself and his followers founded more than two hundred monasteries, which would become the basis for the so-called &quot;monastic colonization&quot; of the little-developed northern lands. &quot;The Life of Sergii Radonezhsky&quot; was written by one of the outstanding writers of that time, Epifaniy the Wise. Andrei Rublev painted his &quot;Trinity&quot;, the greatest masterpiece of the Russian Middle Ages, for the cathedral of Sergii&#x27;s monastery.

Mid-fifteenth-century Muscovy is known for bloody internecine wars for the Moscow seat of the Grand Prince. Ivan III managed to unite the Rus&#x27; lands around Moscow (at the cost of ravaging Novgorod and Pskov) only by the end of the fifteenth century, and put an end to Russia&#x27;s subordination to the Golden Horde after the Great standing on the Ugra river of 1480. The river was later poetically dubbed the &quot;Virgin Belt&quot; (&quot;Poyas Bogoroditsy&quot;). This event marked the birth of the sovereign Russian state, headed by the Grand Prince of Moscow.

<text>The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is a large canine of South America. It is found in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Paraguay, and is almost extinct in Uruguay. Its markings resemble those of foxes, but it is neither a fox nor a wolf. It is the only species in the genus Chrysocyon (meaning &quot;golden dog&quot; in : chryso-kyōn).

It is the largest canine in South America, weighing and up to at the withers. Its long, thin legs and dense reddish coat give it a distinct appearance. The maned wolf is a crepuscular and omnivorous animal adapted to the open environments of the South American savanna, with an important role in the seed dispersal of fruits, especially the wolf apple (&quot;Solanum lycocarpum&quot;). The maned wolf is a solitary animal. It communicates primarily by scent marking, but also gives a loud call known as &quot;roar-barking&quot;.

This mammal lives in open and semi-open habitats, especially grasslands with scattered bushes and trees, in the Cerrado of south, central-west, and southeastern Brazil; Paraguay; northern Argentina; and Bolivia east and north of the Andes, and far southeastern Peru (Pampas del Heath only). It is very rare in Uruguay, possibly being displaced completely through loss of habitat. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as near threatened, while it is considered a vulnerable species by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources. In 2011, a female maned wolf, run over by a truck, underwent stem cell treatment at the , this being the first recorded case of the use of stem cells to heal injuries in a wild animal.

== Etymology ==
The term maned wolf is an allusion to the mane of the nape. It is known locally as (meaning &quot;large fox&quot;) in the Guarani language, or &quot;kalak&quot; in the Toba Qom language, in Portuguese, and , , or in Spanish. The term &quot;lobo&quot;, &quot;wolf&quot;, originates from the Latin . &quot;Guará &quot;and &quot;aguará&quot; originated from Tupi-Guarani &quot;agoa&#x27;rá&quot;, &quot;by the fuzz&quot;. It also is called &quot;borochi&quot; in Bolivia.

==Taxonomy==
Although the maned wolf displays many fox-like characteristics, it is not closely related to foxes. It lacks the elliptical pupils found distinctively in foxes. The maned wolf&#x27;s evolutionary relationship to the other members of the canid family makes it a unique animal.

Electrophoretic studies did not link &quot;Chrysocyon&quot; with any of the other living canids studied. One conclusion of this study is that the maned wolf is the only species among the large South American canids that survived the late Pleistocene extinction. Fossils of the maned wolf from the Holocene and the late Pleistocene have been excavated from the Brazilian Highlands.

A 2003 study on the brain anatomy of several canids placed the maned wolf together with the Falkland Islands wolf and with pseudo-foxes of the genus &quot;Pseudalopex&quot;. One study based on DNA evidence showed that the extinct genus &quot;Dusicyon&quot;, comprising the Falkland Islands wolf and its mainland relative, was the most closely related species to the maned wolf in historical times, and that about seven million years ago it shared a common ancestor with that genus. A 2015 study reported genetic signatures in maned wolves that are indicative of population expansion followed by contraction that took place during Pleistocene interglaciations about 24,000 years before present.

The maned wolf is not closely related to canids found outside South America. It is not a fox, wolf, coyote or jackal, but a distinct canid; though, based only on morphological similarities, it previously had been placed in the &quot;Canis&quot; and &quot;Vulpes&quot; genera. Its closest living relative is the bush dog (genus &quot;Speothos&quot;), and it has a more distant relationship to other South American canines (the short-eared dog, the crab-eating fox, and the zorros or &quot;Lycalopex&quot;).

==Description==

The species was described in 1815 by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger, initially as &quot;Canis brachyurus&quot;. Lorenz Oken classified it as &quot;Vulpes cancosa&quot;, and only in 1839 did Charles Hamilton Smith describe the genus &quot;Chrysocyon&quot;. Other authors later considered it as a member of the &quot;Canis &quot;genus. Fossils of &quot;Chrysocyon&quot; dated from the Late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs were collected in one of Peter Wilheim Lund expeditions to Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais (Brazil). The specimen is kept in the South American Collection of the Zoologisk Museum in Denmark. Since no other record exists of fossils in other areas, the species is suggested to have evolved in this geographic region.

The maned wolf bears minor similarities to the red fox, although it belongs to a different genus and is considerably larger and differently built. The average adult weighs and stands up to tall at the shoulder, and has a head-body length of , with the tail adding another . Its ears are large and long .

The maned wolf is the tallest of the wild canids; its long legs are likely an adaptation to the tall grasslands of its native habitat. Fur of the maned wolf may be reddish-brown to golden orange on the sides with long, black legs, and a distinctive black mane. The coat is marked further with a whitish tuft at the tip of the tail and a white &quot;bib&quot; beneath the throat. The mane is erectile and typically is used to enlarge the wolf&#x27;s profile when threatened or when displaying aggression. Melanistic maned wolves do exist, but are rare. The first photograph of a black adult maned wolf was taken by a camera trap in northern Minas Gerais in Brazil in 2013.

The skull can be identified by its reduced carnassials, small upper incisors, and long canine teeth. Like other canids, it has 42 teeth with the dental formula . The maned wolf&#x27;s rhinarium extends to the upper lip, similar to the bush dog, but its vibrissae are longer. The skull also features a prominent sagittal crest.
The maned wolf&#x27;s footprints are similar to those of the dog, but have disproportionately small plantar pads when compared to the well-opened digit marks. The dog has pads up to three times larger than the maned wolf&#x27;s footprint. These pillows have a triangular shape. The front footprints are long and wide, and those of the hind feet are long and wide. One feature that differentiates the maned wolf&#x27;s footprint from those of other South American canids is the proximal union of the third and fourth digits.

The maned wolf also is known for the distinctive cannabis-like odor of its territory markings, which has earned it the nickname &quot;skunk wolf&quot;.

===Genetics===
Genetically, the maned wolf has 37 pairs of autosomes within diploid genes, with a karyotype similar to that of other canids. It has 76 chromosomes, so cannot interbreed with other canids. Evidence suggests that 15,000 years ago, the species suffered a reduction in its genetic diversity, called the bottleneck effect. However, its diversity is still greater than that of other canids.

==Ecology and behavior==

=== Hunting and territoriality ===
The maned wolf is a twilight animal, but its activity pattern is more related to the relative humidity and temperature, similar to that observed with the bush dog (&quot;Speothos venaticus&quot;). Peak activity occurs between 8 and 10 am, and 8 and 10 pm. On cold or cloudy days, they can be active all day. The species is likely to use open fields for foraging and more closed areas, such as riparian forests, to rest, especially on warmer days.

Unlike most large canids (such as the gray wolf, the African hunting dog, or the dhole), the maned wolf is a solitary animal and does not form packs. It typically hunts alone, usually between sundown and midnight, rotating its large ears to listen for prey animals in the grass. It taps the ground with a front foot to flush out the prey and pounce to catch it. It kills prey by biting on the neck or back, and shaking the prey violently if necessary.

Monogamous pairs may defend a shared territory around , although outside of mating, the individuals may meet only rarely. The territory is crisscrossed by paths that they create as they patrol at night. Several adults may congregate in the presence of a plentiful food source, for example, a fire-cleared patch of grassland that would leave small vertebrate prey exposed while foraging.

Both female and male maned wolves use their urine to communicate, e.g. to mark their hunting paths or the places where they have buried hunted prey. The urine has a very distinctive odor, which some people liken to hops or cannabis. The responsible substance very likely is a pyrazine, which also occurs in both plants. At the Rotterdam Zoo, this smell once set the police on a hunt for cannabis smokers. The preferred habitat of the maned wolf includes grasslands, scrub prairies, and forests.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Their mating season ranges from November to April. Gestation lasts 60 to 65 days, and a litter may have from two to six black-furred pups, each weighing roughly . Pups are fully grown when one year old. During that first year, the pups rely on their parents for food.

Data on the maned wolf&#x27;s estrus and reproductive cycle mainly come from captive animals, particularly about breeding endocrinology. Hormonal changes of maned wolves in the wild follow the same variation pattern of those in captivity. Females ovulate spontaneously, but some authors suggest that the presence of a male is important for estrus induction.

Captive animals in the Northern Hemisphere breed between October and February and in the Southern Hemisphere between August and October. This indicates that photoperiod plays an important role in maned wolf reproduction, mainly due to the production of semen. Generally, one estrus occurs per year. The amount of sperm produced by the maned wolf is lower compared to those of other canids.

Copulation occurs during the four-day estrus period, and lasts up to 15 minutes. Courtship is similar to that of other canids, characterized by frequent approaches and anogenital investigation.

Gestation lasts 60 to 65 days and a litter may have from two to six pups. One litter of seven has been recorded. Birthing has been observed in May in the Canastra Mountains, but data from captive animals suggest that births are concentrated between June and September. The maned wolf reproduces with difficulty in the wild, with a high rate of infant mortality. Females can go up to two years without breeding. Breeding in captivity is even more difficult, especially in temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere.

Pups are born weighing between 340 and 430 grams. They begin their lives with black fur, becoming red after 10 weeks. The eyes open at about 9 days of age. They are nursed up to 4 months. Afterwards, they are fed by their parents by regurgitation, starting on the third week of age and lasting up to 10 months. Three-month-old pups begin to accompany their mother while she forages. Males and females both engage in parental care, but it is primarily done by the females. Data on male parental care have been collected from captive animals, and little is known whether this occurs frequently in the wild. Maned wolves reach sexual maturity at one year of age, when they leave their birth territory.

The maned wolf&#x27;s longevity in the wild is unknown, but estimates in captivity are between 12 and 15 years. A report was made of an individual at the São Paulo Zoo that lived to be 22 years old.

===Diet===

The maned wolf is omnivorous. It specialises in preying on small and medium-sized animals, including small mammals (typically rodents and rabbits), birds and their eggs, reptiles, and even fish, gastropods, other terrestrial molluscs, and insects, but a large portion of its diet (more than 50%, according to some studies) is vegetable matter, including sugarcane, tubers, bulbs, roots and fruit. Up to 301 food items have been recorded in the maned wolf&#x27;s diet, including 116 plants and 178 animal species.

The maned wolf hunts by chasing its prey, digging holes, and jumping to catch birds in flight. About 21% of hunts are successful. Some authors have recorded active pursuits of the Pampas deer. They were also observed feeding on carcasses of run down animals. Fecal analysis has shown consumption of the giant anteater, bush dog, and collared peccary, but whether these animals are actively hunted or scavenged is not known. Armadillos are also commonly consumed. Animals are more often consumed in the dry season.

The wolf apple (&quot;Solanum lycocarpum&quot;), a tomato-like fruit, is the maned wolf&#x27;s most common food item. With some exceptions, these fruits make up between 40 and 90% of the maned wolf&#x27;s diet. The wolf apple is actively sought by the maned wolf, and is consumed throughout the year, unlike other fruits that can only be eaten in abundance during the rainy season. It can consume several fruits at a time and disperse intact seeds by defecating, making it an excellent disperser of the wolf apple plant.

Despite their preferred habitat, maned wolves are ecologically flexible and can survive in disturbed habitats, from burned areas to places with high human influences. Burned areas have some small mammals, such as hairy-tailed bolo mouse (&quot;Necromys lasiurus&quot;) and vesper mouse (&quot;Calomys&quot; spp.) that they can hunt and survive on.

Historically, captive maned wolves were fed meat-heavy diets, but that caused them to develop bladder stones. Zoo diets for them now feature fruits and vegetables, as well as meat and specialized extruded diet formulated for maned wolves to be low in stone-causing compounds (i.e. cystine).

A maned wolf from Texas was found to be a host of an intestinal acanthocephalan worm, &quot;Pachysentis canicola&quot;.

==Relations with other species==
The maned wolf participates in symbiotic relationships. It contributes to the propagation and dissemination of the plants on which it feeds, through excretion. Often, maned wolves defecate on the nests of leafcutter ants. The ants then use the dung to fertilize their fungus gardens, but they discard the seeds contained in the dung onto refuse piles just outside their nests. This process significantly increases the germination rate of the seeds.

Maned wolves suffer from ticks, mainly of the genus &quot;Amblyomma&quot;, and by flies such as &quot;Cochliomyia hominivorax&quot; usually on the ears. The maned wolf is poorly parasitized by fleas. The sharing of territory with domestic dogs results in a number of diseases, such as rabies virus, parvovirus, distemper, canine adenovirus, protozoan &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, bacterium &quot;Leptospira interrogans&quot;, and nematode &quot;Dirofilaria immitis&quot;. The maned wolf is particularly susceptible to potentially fatal infection by the giant kidney worm. Ingestion of the wolf apple could prevent maned wolves from contracting this nematode, but such a hypothesis has been questioned by several authors.

Its predators are mainly large cats, such as the puma (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) and the jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;), but it is most often preyed upon by the jaguar.

===Humans===
Generally, the maned wolf is shy and flees when alarmed, so it poses little direct threat to humans. Popularly, the maned wolf is thought to have the potential of being a chicken thief. It once was considered a similar threat to cattle, sheep, and pigs, although this now is known to be false.
Historically, in a few parts of Brazil, these animals were hunted for some body parts, notably the eyes, that were believed to be good-luck charms.
Since its classification as a vulnerable species by the Brazilian government, it has received greater consideration and protection.

They are threatened by habitat loss and being run over by automobiles. Feral and domestic dogs pass on diseases to them, and have been known to attack them.

The species occurs in several protected areas, including the national parks of Caraça and Emas in Brazil. The maned wolf is well represented in captivity, and has been bred successfully at many zoos, particularly in Argentina, North America (part of a Species Survival Plan) and Europe (part of a European Endangered Species Programme). In 2012, a total of 3,288 maned wolves were kept at more than 300 institutions worldwide. The Smithsonian National Zoo Park has been working to protect maned wolves for nearly 30 years, and coordinates the collaborative, interzoo maned wolf Species Survival Plan of North America, which includes breeding maned wolves, studying them in the wild, protecting their habitat, and educating people about them.

====Hunting====
The practice of hunting maned wolves is historically poorly documented, but it is speculated to be relatively frequent. This is partly because during the Portuguese and Spanish colonization of South America, Europeans projected onto the maned wolf the historical aversion they had towards Iberian wolves, and their reputation for eating sheep and other domestic animals. Although the species is now seen in a better light, many people still consider it a potential risk to domestic birds and children.

In Brazil, the impacts of hunting on the species are better known than in Argentina, as is the impact of predation on domestic birds, which engenders retaliation from farmers. The species is also accused of attacking sheep, which increases human animosity. In Brazil, people also aimed to prevent these animals from attacking chickens, using a Brazilian variant of the Portuguese podengo, called the &quot;Brazilian podengo&quot; or &quot;Crioulo podengo&quot;.

== Conservation ==
The maned wolf is not considered an endangered species by the IUCN because of its wide geographical distribution and adaptability to man-made environments. However, due to declining populations, it is classified as a near-threatened species. This decline is mostly due to human activities such as deforestation, increasing traffic in highways resulting in roadkill, and urban growth. Due to the decrease in their habitat, the wolves often migrate to urban regions looking for easier access to food. This increases their contact with domestic animals, as well as the risk of infectious and parasitic diseases amongst the wolves which can lead to death.

Until 1996 the maned wolf was a vulnerable species by the IUCN. It is also listed in CITES Appendix II, which regulates international trade in the species. The ICMBio list in Brazil that follows the same IUCN criteria considers the wolf to be a vulnerable species. By these same criteria, the Brazilian state lists also consider it more problematic: it is a vulnerable species in the lists of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, while in the lists of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul the maned wolf is considered as &quot;endangered&quot; and &quot;critically endangered&quot; respectively. In Uruguay, although there is no such list as Brazil and IUCN, it is regarded as a species with &quot;priority&quot; for conservation. In Argentina it is not considered to be in critical danger, but it is recognized that its populations are declining and fragmented. The situation of the maned wolf in Bolivia and Paraguay is uncertain. Even with these uncertainties the maned wolf is protected against hunting in all countries.

In Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay it is forbidden by law to hunt the maned wolf. Conservationists are also taking other steps to ensure its survival, especially as urbanization continues to spread in its natural habitat.

== In human cultures ==
Human attitudes and opinions about the maned wolf vary across populations, ranging from fear and tolerance to aversion. In some regions of Brazil, parts of the animal&#x27;s body are believed to help cure bronchitis, kidney disease, and even snake bites. It is also believed to bring good luck. These parts can be teeth, the heart, ears, and even dry stools. In Bolivia, mounting a saddle made of maned wolf leather is believed to protect from bad luck. Despite these superstitions, no large-scale use of parts of this animal occurs.

In urban societies in Brazil, people tend to be sympathetic to the maned wolf, seeing no value in it as a hunting animal or pest. They often consider its preservation to be important, and although these societies associate it with force and ferocity, they do not consider it a dangerous animal. Although popular in some places and common in many zoos, it can go unnoticed. Studies in zoos in Brazil showed that up to 30% of respondents were either unaware or unable to recognize a maned wolf.

It was considered a common animal by the Guarani people, and the first names used by Europeans, such as the Spanish Jesuit missionary Joseph of Anchieta, were the same used by the native peoples (&quot;yaguaraçú&quot;). Spanish naturalist Felix de Azara also used the Guarani name to refer to it and was one of the first to describe the biology of the species and consider it an important part of Paraguay&#x27;s fauna. Much of the negative view of the maned wolf as a poultry predator stems from European ethnocentrism, where peasants often had problems with wolves and foxes.

The maned wolf rarely causes antipathy in the human populations of the places in which it lives, so it has been used as a flag species for the preservation of the Brazilian cerrado. It is represented on the 200-reais banknote, released in September 2020. It has also been represented on the 100-cruzeiros reais coin, which circulated in Brazil between 1993 and 1994.

<text>Robert Hugh Leckie (December 18, 1920 – December 24, 2001) was a United States Marine and an author of books about the military history of the United States, Catholic history and culture, sports books, fiction books, autobiographies, and children&#x27;s books. As a young man, he served with the 1st Marine Division during World War II; his service as a machine gunner and a scout during the war greatly influenced his work.

Leckie&#x27;s war memoir, &quot;Helmet for My Pillow&quot;, along with Eugene B. Sledge&#x27;s book &quot;With the Old Breed&quot;, formed the basis for the HBO series &quot;The Pacific&quot; (2010), the follow-up series to &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. In the miniseries, Leckie is portrayed by James Badge Dale.

==Early life and education==
Leckie was born on December 18, 1920, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to an Irish Catholic family of eight children. He grew up in Rutherford, New Jersey, and attended St. Mary High School.

==Early career and military service==
He began his career as a writer in high school, as a sports writer for &quot;The Bergen Evening Record&quot; in Hackensack, New Jersey. On January 18, 1942, Leckie enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He served in combat in the Pacific theater, as a scout and a machine gunner in H (How) Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division (H/2/1).

Leckie saw combat in the Battle of Tenaru and in the Guadalcanal Campaign and the Battle of Cape Gloucester, and he was wounded by a blast concussion in the Battle of Peleliu. Due to his wounds, he was evacuated to an army field hospital in the Russell Islands. He returned to the United States in March 1945 and was honorably discharged shortly thereafter.

===Military decorations===
Leckie&#x27;s decorations include:

==Later career==
Following World War II, Leckie worked as a reporter for the Associated Press, the &quot;Buffalo Courier-Express&quot;, the &quot;New York Journal American&quot;, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, and &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;.

According to his wife Vera, in 1951 Leckie was inspired to write a memoir after seeing &quot;South Pacific&quot; on Broadway and walking out halfway through it. He said, &quot;I have to tell the story of how it really was. I have to let people know the war wasn&#x27;t a musical.&quot;

His first and best-selling book, &quot;Helmet for My Pillow&quot;, a war memoir, was published in 1957. Leckie wrote more than 40 books on American war history, spanning from the French and Indian War (1754–1763) to Desert Storm (1991).

==Personal life==
He married Vera Keller, and they had three children. Vera died in 2024 aged 100.

==Death==
A longtime resident of Byram Township, New Jersey, Leckie died on December 24, 2001, six days after his 81st birthday, after fighting a long battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He was survived by his wife of 55 years, his three children, two sisters, and six grandchildren. His remains were entombed at St. Joseph&#x27;s Mausoleum in Newton, New Jersey.

<text>Bledlow Ridge is a village in the civil parish of Bledlow-cum-Saunderton in Buckinghamshire, England. In 2004 the population was 940. It is situated in the Chiltern Hills, about 4 miles south-southwest of Princes Risborough and on the road between the High Wycombe and Chinnor.

Originally the hamlet was within the ecclesiastical parish of Bledlow. It gained separate status in 1868 when the new chapel, dedicated to St Paul, was constructed.

In common with other similar villages in the Chiltern Hills properties have become increasingly sought after due to its location and the improvement in rail and road connections to London. It has a recently refurbished village shop, &quot;The Country Store Kedai&quot;, and a local school, Bledlow Ridge School. Bledlow Ridge has a number of clubs including the youth club &quot;Bridge&quot;, Bledlow Ridge Tennis Club, and Bledlow Ridge Cricket Club. As well as the corner shop, there is also an Equestrian Centre, children&#x27;s playground, tennis courts and a cricket pitch. Yoesden, south of Chinnor Road, is a nature reserve managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.

<text>Bennachie ( ; Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Beinn na Cìche&quot;) is a range of hills in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It has several tops, the highest of which, Oxen Craig, has a height of . Though not particularly high, compared to other peaks within Scotland, the mountain is very prominent, owing to its isolation and the relative flatness of the surrounding terrain, and dominates the skyline from several viewpoints.

The peak that stands out the most visually is Mither Tap (518 m, 1699 feet) and from its top there are good views of the county to the north and east. Most of the tops lie along an east / west ridge, with the exception of Millstone Hill (409 m) an outlier or spur which is separated from and to the south of the main ridge. Mither Tap has an Iron Age fort on its summit. Unlike with many other hilltop forts in the area, there are no signs of vitrification in the stone. Bennachie is visible from a number of distant points; to the north it is visible from Longman Hill, a point considerably to the north.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of Bennachie is uncertain. Suggestions include &quot;Initially &quot;Beinn a Cioch&quot;, the hill of the nipple or pap.&quot; It has also been translated as the &quot;‘Mountain of Ce’&quot; , a king mentioned in the List of legendary kings of Pictland.

== History of the area ==

From 1800 to 1859 common land on the east side of Bennachie was home to a community of squatters known locally as the Colony. A small number of families led a crofting life often doing skilled work, such as dyking and quarrying, for local landowners. After 1859 the Colony dwindled as the common land was broken up and divided amongst the local estates. However, the last of the original colonists, George Esson, lived on the hill until his death in the 1930s. Visitors to Bennachie can explore the remains of the Colony and extensive work is being done on site and amongst local parish records to determine the history of the Colonists.

===Mither Tap ===

In the 1870s Christian Maclagan, an early Scottish archaeologist, surveyed and conducted excavations at Mither Tap in 1876 and 1881. 

In 2019 the University of Aberdeen Northern Picts Project conducted an excavation at Mither Tap.

It has been suggested as a possible site of the battle of Mons Graupius.

== Paths and environment ==

The range of hills is a popular destination for walkers since it is relatively close to Aberdeen. The Gordon Way is a waymarked trail that traverses the Southern flank of Bennachie between the Visitors Centre in the East and Suie Car Park to the West. Most of the Bennachie range is owned by Forestry and Land Scotland, which maintains a network of paths on and around the hills, several car parks and a visitor centre located at the eastern foot of the range. A volunteer conservation charity, the Bailies of Bennachie, founded in 1973, helps with this work and with other environmental and archaeological activities on the hill. There are several marked paths, including fairly easy ascents of Oxen Craig and Mither Tap that start from the centre.

In 2023, the Bailies of Bennachie received the Community Initiative Award at RSPB Scotland’s Nature of Scotland Awards 2023.

<text>Bletchley is a constituent town of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England, in the south-west of the city, split between the civil parishes of Bletchley and Fenny Stratford and West Bletchley, which In 2011 had a combined population of 37,114.

Bletchley is best known for Bletchley Park, the headquarters of Britain&#x27;s World War II codebreaking organisation, and now a major tourist attraction. The National Museum of Computing is also located on the Park.

==History==
===Origins and early modern history===
The town name is Anglo-Saxon and means &quot;Blæcca&#x27;s clearing&quot;. It was first recorded in manorial rolls in the 12th century as &quot;Bicchelai&quot;, then later as &quot;Blechelegh&quot; (13th century) and &quot;Blecheley&quot; (14th–16th centuries). Just to the south of Fenny Stratford, there was Romano-British town, &quot;M&quot; on either side of Watling Street, a Roman road.

Bletchley was originally a minor village on the outskirts of Fenny Stratford, of lesser importance than Water Eaton. Fenny Stratford fell into decline from the English Civil War (17c) onwards. The arrival of the London and Birmingham Railway (now part of the West Coast Main Line) from 1838, and particularly of the branch lines to Bedford (1846) and Buckingham (1850) (that together subsequently became the – &quot;Varsity Line&quot;), made the station at Bletchley a substantial one. Bletchley grew to eclipse both its antecedents.

Almost forty years after the construction of Bletchley railway station, the 1884/5 Ordnance Survey shows Bletchley as still just a small village around the C of E parish church at Old Bletchley, and a (separate) hamlet near the Methodist chapel and &quot;Shoulder of Mutton&quot; public house at the junction of Shenley Road/Newton Road with Buckingham Road. (These districts are known today as Old Bletchley and Far Bletchley). The major settlement of the time is nearby Fenny Stratford.

The Bletchley area is rich in Oxford Clay, which has long been used for bricks. Brick-making has taken place on the Newton Leys site and the surrounding area from the late 19th century, circa 1897. Bletchley Brickworks closed in September 1990.

===&quot;Bigger, Better, Brighter&quot; – Bletchley in the 20th century===

In the urban growth of the Victorian period brought by the railway, the town merged with Fenny Stratford. The latter had been constituted an urban district (with Simpson) in 1895, and Bletchley was added in 1898. By 1911, the population of the combined parishes was 5,166 but the balance between them had changed: in that year, the name of the local council (Urban District) changed from Fenny Stratford UD to Bletchley UD. The 1926 Ordnance Survey shows the settlements beginning to merge, with large private houses along the Bletchley Road between them. In 1933, the newly founded Bletchley Gazette began a campaign for a &quot;Bigger, Better, Brighter, Bletchley&quot;. As the nation emerged from World War II, Bletchley Council renewed its desire to expand from its 1951 population of 10,919. By mid-1952, the council was able to agree terms with five London Boroughs to accept people and businesses from bombed-out sites in London. This trend continued through the 1950s and 1960s, culminating in the GLC-funded Lakes Estate in Water Eaton parish, even as Milton Keynes was being founded. Industrial development kept pace, with former London businesses relocating to new industrial estates in Mount Farm and Denbigh – Marshall Amplification being the most notable. With compulsory purchase, Bletchley Road (now renamed to Queensway after a royal visit in 1966) became the new high street with wide pavements where front gardens once lay. Houses near the railway end were replaced by shops but those nearer Fenny Stratford became banks and professional premises. At the 1971 Census, the population of the Bletchley Urban District was 30,642.

===Bletchley in Milton Keynes===

Proposals for a new city in North Buckinghamshire had been floated from the early 1960s. Bletchley had fought to be the centre of the proposed new city, but it was not to be. When the Milton Keynes designation order was made in 1967, Bletchley was at its southern end rather than its centre. The 1971 &quot;Plan for Milton Keynes&quot; placed Central Milton Keynes on a completely new hill-top site four miles further north, halfway to Wolverton. Bletchley was relegated to the status of suburb. Bletchley thrived in the early years of the growth of Milton Keynes, since it was the main shopping area. Bletchley centre was altered considerably when the Brunel Shopping Centre was built in the early 1970s, creating a new end to Queensway. (Previously, Queensway – formerly known as Bletchley Road – was a continuous run from Fenny Stratford to Old Bletchley). Bletchley&#x27;s boom came to an end when the new Central Milton Keynes Shopping Centre was built and commercial Bletchley has declined as a retail destination since then.

The town&#x27;s importance as a major hub within Milton Keynes and the wider region was recognised in March 2021 following a successful bid by the Bletchley and Fenny Stratford Town Deal Board, when MK City Council was successful in securing an award of £22.7mn as part of the UK Government&#x27;s &quot;New Towns Deal&quot;, with the City Council focusing most of that money on Bletchley and Fenny Stratford. This led to the publishing of the Bletchley and Fenny Stratford Town Investment Plan (TIP), with the plan aiming to boost jobs, skills and connectivity in the area, and further invest in Central Bletchley (the town centre).

==Bletchley Park==

Within the West Bletchley parish, in the Church Green district, is Bletchley Park, which, during the Second World War, was home to the Government Code and Cypher School. The German Enigma code was cracked here by, amongst others, Alan Turing. Another cipher machine was solved with the aid of early computing devices, known as Colossus. The park is now a museum, although many areas of the park grounds have been sold off for housing development.

===Wilton Hall===

The nearby Wilton Hall was built in 1943 as part of the Bletchley Park estate and was used by the government as a meeting place by day and a music and dance venue by night. After World War II, the venue continued to remain open and played host to musicians such as Lulu and The Rolling Stones.

In recent years, the building was slated for demolition after its closure in 2019. However, after residents and the local MP rejected calls for the demolition of the site due to historical value, the building was sold to a new partnership in 2020 who have refurbished and reopened the building in 2022.

==Civil parishes: Bletchley and Fenny Stratford, and West Bletchley==
&quot;For more details about the districts of Bletchley, see these civil parish articles.&quot;

The Bletchley built-up area is divided for administrative purposes into two civil parishes, Bletchley and Fenny Stratford and West Bletchley

The districts that make up Bletchley and Fenny Stratford CP are: Brickfields (includes the Blue Lagoon), Central Bletchley, Denbigh (including Denbigh North), Eaton Manor, Fenny Stratford, Granby, Manor Farm, Mount Farm, Newton Leys and Water Eaton (includes &quot;Lakes Estate&quot;). At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 15,313.

West Bletchley CP covers that part of Milton Keynes that is south of Standing Way (A421), west of the West Coast Main Line and north of the Varsity Line. At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 15,313. The districts and neighbourhoods in the parish are: Church Green (including Bletchley Park); Far Bletchley; Old Bletchley; West Bletchley (district); Whaddon (ward around Whaddon Way, not to be confused with nearby Whaddon in Aylesbury Vale).

In 1961 the parish of Bletchley had a population of 17,095. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and became an unparished area of the Milton Keynes district.

==Transport==
===Rail===
The town is served by Bletchley railway station, on Sherwood Drive, which is on both the West Coast Main Line and the Bletchley-Bedford Marston Vale Line, a constituent part of the former Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Line that closed in 1967. However, a major project called East West Rail is underway to rebuild and reopen the route to the west of Bletchley to via Winslow; the line from Bicester Village to Oxford has already been rebuilt. Eventually, full services through to Cambridge are planned.

===Road===
Major Milton Keynes grid roads serving the town include Watling Street (which has the V4 designation between Denbigh North and Stony Stratford), V7 Saxon Street (connecting Central Bletchley with the rest of the city) and H8 Standing Way (A421) (which runs westwards towards Buckingham, the M40 and Oxford, and eastwards through the south-east of the city crossing and connecting to the M1 at Junction 13 and running towards Bedford, the A1 and Cambridge). The A5 passes along the eastern flank of Fenny Stratford, connecting it and Bletchley with the city centre, the A509, A422 and A508 roads. The A4146 southern bypass serves Water Eaton, Newton Leys and Fenny Stratford.

Watling Street, originally the Roman road between Dover and Wroxeter and serving &quot;Magiovinium&quot; (the Romano-British town that preceded Fenny, runs through Fenny Stratford and on through Stony Stratford).

===Bus===
Bletchley is MK&#x27;s main southern interchange point for cross-city and rural bus services. The town is served by Arriva buses 4, 5, 6, 150, F70/F77 and M6; Z&amp;S Transport bus 50; Red Rose bus 100; and Star Travel bus 162.

The town&#x27;s main bus station is located on South Terrace, just east of V7 Saxon Street in Central Bletchley.

MK City Council also operates an on demand bus service known as &quot;MK Connect&quot;, which serves the whole MK unitary authority area, including Bletchley.

==Sport and leisure==
Bletchley has a football club, Milton Keynes Irish and a rugby union club, Bletchley RUFC, both of which play at Manor Fields just south of Fenny Stratford.

Bletchley Leisure Centre was completed in 2009, replacing the original 1970s building.

Stadium MK, home of Milton Keynes Dons is at the northern edge of the town. This area also contains what is known as the &quot;MK1&quot; shopping centre. This includes shops, restaurants, and an Odeon cinema (which moved to MK1 from The Point building in Milton Keynes Central in 2015).

==Political representation==
Bletchley is divided between three electoral wards of Milton Keynes City Council, consisting of Bletchley East (3 Labour), Bletchley West (2 Labour, 1 Conservative) and Bletchley Park (1 Labour, 2 Conservative), and is in the parliamentary constituency of Milton Keynes South.

==ONS built up area==

For the 2011 census, the Office for National Statistics designated a &quot;built up area sub-division&quot;, being that part of Milton Keynes that is west of the A5 and south of the A421, some . At the 2011 census, the population of the area was 37,114.

For the 2001 census, it designated a (larger) &quot;urban sub-area&quot; that approximates to the boundaries of the former Bletchley Urban District Council at the time of the designation of Milton Keynes. It also included that part of Winslow Rural District that fell within the designation. In outline, the ONS Sub-area consisted of Bletchley and Fenny Stratford Civil Parish, West Bletchley Civil Parish and part of Shenley Brook End Civil Parish (specifically Furzton, Emerson Valley, Tattenhoe and Snelshall). At the 2001 Census, the population of the Sub-area was 47,176.

<text>The Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy is a large, wide-bodied, American cargo aircraft used for aerial transport of outsized cargo components. The Mini Guppy is one of the Guppy line of aircraft produced by Aero Spacelines, alongside the Pregnant Guppy and Super Guppy.

==Variants==
The Mini Guppy was produced in two variants.

===Mini Guppy===

The sole Model 377MG Mini Guppy was converted from a Boeing 377-10-26 (c/n 15937) and registered N1037V. An entirely new fuselage was fitted to the aircraft with a cargo bay measuring long and wide with a cargo floor; smaller than the cargo bay of the preceding Pregnant Guppy. Cargo was loaded through a hinged swinging tail. It retained the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 engines of the Stratocruiser, though provisions were made for the installation of Allison 501 turboprop engines. The vertical tail was extended by , while a new wing center section increased the wingspan by . The Mini Guppy&#x27;s empty weight was .

=== Mini Guppy Turbine ===
Two further Mini Guppies were built from parts of several Boeing 377 and C-97 aircraft, registered N111AS (c/n 0001) and N112AS (c/n 0002). Known as the Model 101 Mini Guppy Turbine, these aircraft differed from the original Mini Guppy in that they were powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney T34-PWA turboprop engines and that cargo was loaded through a swinging nose section.

== Operational history ==
Mini Guppy N1037V made its first flight on May 24, 1967 and was displayed at the that year&#x27;s Paris Air Show. In 1969, N1037V ferried parts to repair a Boeing 707 that had been damaged in a hijacking in Damascus. In 1972, N1037V was used to transport &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; to Cape Canaveral and the Goodyear GZ-20 &quot;Europa&quot; from Akron Municipal Airport to Cardington Airfield, becoming the largest aircraft to fly out of Akron. American Jet Industries acquired the aircraft in 1974 and operated it as N422AU. N422AU was subsequently sold to Aero Union in 1980 and Erickson Inc. in 1988 before being retired to the Tillamook Air Museum in 1995.

N111AS first took to the air on May 1, 1970, but was short-lived. On May 12, 1970, N111AS crashed during its twelfth test flight at Edwards Air Force Base, California, killing all four onboard crew members. The aircraft was performing a planned three-engine takeoff when it rolled and turned. The left wingtip struck the ground followed by the forward fuselage, destroying the flight deck.

The FAA registration for N112AS was canceled on October 9, 1975.

== Aircraft on display ==
Mini Guppy N422AU is on display at Tillamook Air Museum. In 2014, the museum announced that it planned to transfer its aircraft collection to Madras, Oregon, which would require the Mini Guppy to be restored to airworthy condition and flown to the new location. A new airworthiness certificate was issued for N422AU in January 2017.

<text>Meneñ Stadium, also spelled Meneng, is a former stadium on the island Nauru. It is located in the Meneng District. Constructed in 2006, it had a capacity of 3,500 spectators. Unlike other stadiums on the island, Meneñ Stadium had bleachers for spectators.

== History ==
The area, a large empty sports field, was converted by the Australian Government into a containment area for asylum seekers under the Pacific Solution. At its place is the Nauru Australian Immigration Detention Center (Nauru Regional Processing Centre), which had a small soccer field in the facility.

As part of Nauru&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to host the 2017 Pacific Mini Games, the Meneng stadium complex was to be upgraded to include tiered seating for 10,000 spectators, reclaiming land that was previously damaged by phosphate mining.

<text>Triangular trade or triangle trade is trade between three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has export commodities that are not required in the region from which its major imports come. It has been used to offset trade imbalances between different regions.

The Atlantic slave trade used a system of three-way transatlantic exchanges – known historically as the triangular trade – which operated between Europe, Africa, and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries. European workers outfitted slave ships, and they shipped manufactured European goods owned by the trading companies to West Africa to get slaves, which they shipped to the Americas, in particular, to Brazil and the Caribbean islands. First, in West Africa, merchants sold or bartered European manufactured goods to local slavers in exchange for slaves. Then crews transported the slaves, and remaining European manufactured goods, to the Americas where ship merchants sold the slaves and European manufactured goods to plantation owners. Merchants then purchased sugar and molasses from the plantation owners and crews shipped them to North American colonies (later the US), where the merchants sold the remaining supplies of European manufactured goods and slaves, as well as sugar and molasses from plantations to local buyers, and then purchased North American commodities to sell in Europe, including tobacco, sugar, cotton, rum, rice, lumber, and animal pelts. 

This trade, in trade volume, was primarily with South America, where most slaves were sold, but a classic example taught in 20th century studies is the colonial molasses trade, which involved the circuitous trading of slaves, sugar (often in liquid form, as molasses), and rum between West Africa, the West Indies and the northern colonies of British North America in the 17th and 18th centuries. In this triangular trade slaves grew the sugar that was used to brew rum, which in turn was traded for more slaves. In this circuit the sea lane west from Africa to the West Indies (and later, also to Brazil) was known as the Middle Passage; its cargo consisted of abducted or recently purchased African people.

During the Age of Sail, the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of winds and currents. For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going south of 30° N latitude and reaching the so-called &quot;trade winds&quot;, thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the North American mainland. Returning from North America, it was easiest to follow the Gulf Stream in a northeasterly direction using the westerlies. (Even before the voyages of Christopher Columbus, the Portuguese had been using a similar triangle to sail to the Canary Islands and the Azores, and it was then expanded outwards.)

The countries that controlled the transatlantic slave market until the 18th century in terms of the number of enslaved people shipped were Great Britain, Portugal, and France.

==Atlantic triangular slave trade==

The most historically significant triangular trade was the transatlantic slave trade which operated among Europe, Africa, and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries. Slave ships would leave European ports (such as Bristol and Nantes) and sail to African ports loaded with goods manufactured in Europe. There, the slave traders would purchase enslaved Africans by exchanging the goods, then sail to the Americas via the Middle Passage to sell their enslaved cargo in European colonies. In what was referred to as a &quot;golden triangle&quot;, the slave ship would sail back to Europe to begin the cycle again. The enslaved Africans were primarily purchased for the purpose of working on plantations to work producing valuable cash crops (such as sugar, cotton, and tobacco) which were in high demand in Europe. Slave traders from European colonies would occasionally travel to Africa themselves, eliminating the European portion of the voyage.
A classic example is the colonial molasses trade. Merchants purchased raw sugar (often in its liquid form, molasses) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. Merchant capitalists used cash from the sale of sugar to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which their crews shipped to Europe. With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe&#x27;s manufactured goods, including tools and weapons and on the next leg, shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they bartered the goods for slaves seized by local potentates. Crews then transported the slaves to the Caribbean and sold them to sugar plantation owners. The cash from the sale of slaves in Brazil, the Caribbean islands, and the American South was used to buy more raw materials, restarting the cycle. The full triangle trip took a calendar year on average, according to historian Clifford Shipton.


The first leg of the triangle was from a European port to one in West Africa (then known as the &quot;Slave Coast&quot;), in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as copper, cloth, trinkets, slave beads, guns and ammunition. When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. Ports that exported these enslaved people from Africa include Ouidah, Lagos, Aného (Little Popo), Grand-Popo, Agoué, Jakin, Porto-Novo, and Badagry. These ports traded slaves who were supplied from African communities, tribes and kingdoms, including the Alladah and Ouidah, which were later taken over by the Dahomey kingdom. 

On the second leg, ships made the journey of the Middle Passage from Africa to the New World. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the slave ships. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port, from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from Virginia, tobacco and hemp. The ship then returned to Europe to complete the triangle.

The triangle route was not generally followed by individual ships. Slave ships were built to carry large numbers of people, rather than cargo, and variations in the duration of the Atlantic crossing meant that they often arrived in the Americas out-of-season. Slave ships thus often returned to their home port carrying whatever goods were readily available in the Americas but with a large part or all of their capacity with ballast. Cash crops were transported mainly by a separate fleet which only sailed from Europe to the Americas and back. In his books, Herbert S. Klein has argued that in many fields (cost of trade, ways of transport, mortality levels, earnings and benefits of trade for the Europeans and the &quot;so-called triangular trade&quot;), the non-scientific literature portrays a situation which the contemporary historiography refuted a long time ago.
Finally, even if the &quot;triangle trade&quot; idea is essentially incorrect, the Atlantic slave trade was one of the more complex of international trades that existed in the modern period. (…) Thus, while an actual &quot;triangle trade&quot; may not have existed as a significant development for ships in the trade, the economic ties between Asia, Europe, Africa, and America clearly involved a web of relationships that spanned the globe.

A 2017 study provides evidence for the hypothesis that the export of gunpowder to Africa increased the transatlantic slave trade: &quot;A one percent increase in gunpowder set in motion a 5-year gun-slave cycle that increased slave exports by an average of 50%, and the impact continued to grow over time.&quot;

===New England===
New England also made rum from Caribbean sugar and molasses, which it shipped to Africa as well as within the New World. Yet, the &quot;triangle trade&quot; as considered in relation to New England was a piecemeal operation. No New England traders are known to have completed a sequential circuit of the full triangle, which took a calendar year on average, according to historian Clifford Shipton. The concept of the New England Triangular trade was first suggested, inconclusively, in an 1866 book by George H. Moore, was picked up in 1872 by historian George C. Mason, and reached full consideration from a lecture in 1887 by American businessman and historian William B. Weeden.

In the context of an incohesive operation rather than a sequential circuit, expansive eastern seaboard &quot;Farms&quot; had, in earnest after 1690, sustained southern New England proprietorship, land banks, and currency within a Greater Caribbean plantation complex. Historian Sean Kelley examines nineteenth-century &quot;American slavers&quot; because &quot;the North American transatlantic slave trade before 1776 was, in essence, merely another branch of the carrying trade.&quot; During the seventeenth century, colonial charters and royal commissioners precluded earlier attempts to establish a New England carrying trade by, for example, the Atherton Trading Company and John Hull. But proposals by Peleg Sanford provided implementation frameworks for &quot;Farms&quot; and carriers. Linkages within the complex would also ebb and flow with the tides of war and hurricanes. Before 1780, the Atlantic hurricane season contributed to New England and Greater Caribbean circumvention of mercantile trade restrictions. Newport carriers, for instance, provisioned Dutch, Danish, and especially French plantations in the Greater Caribbean, periodically more than lackluster British sites, to recompense for hurricane reductions in exports and imports. Periodic trials and executions of notorious smugglers diminshed royal peacetime embargoes, particularly in response to illegal carrying as well as General Assembly endorsement of Aquidneck as a haven for pirates. These pirates began to disperse from Newport between Queen Anne&#x27;s War and 1723 mass executions, establishing the seaport as the dominant carrying hub, with Providence coming in a distant second. British carriers continued to provision plantations outside the boundaries of empire. 

Wartime embargoes that reduced overseas trade would, in turn, spur speculative ventures as well as land and estuary auctions of Narragansett tribal reserves, under legislature (public) jurisdiction, by private trusts, a specific type of fiduciary relationship for subsidizing expense accounts, purveying regular annuities, or both. Bidders at vendue were frequently interior &quot;composite&quot; yeomen and fishermen, who (according to certain historians) misconceived of revenue derived from the carrying trade as income &quot;competency.&quot; Bidders included competitive carriers in secondary seaports such as Providence as well. Despite the antebellum rise of &quot;Greater Northeast&quot; industrial agriculture, the southern New England &quot;Farms&quot; and the carrying trade in Caribbean sugar, molasses, rice, coffee, indigo, mahogany, and pre-1740 &quot;seasoned slaves&quot;, began to dissipate by the Election of 1800 and largely collapsed into agrarian ruins by the War of 1812. 

Newport and Bristol, Rhode Island, were major ports involved in the colonial triangular slave trade. Many significant Newport merchants and traders participated in the trade, working closely with merchants and traders in the Caribbean and Charleston, South Carolina.

==Statistics==
According to research provided by Emory University as well as Henry Louis Gates Jr., an estimated 12.5 million slaves were transported from Africa to colonies in North and South America. The website assembles data regarding past trafficking in slaves from Africa. It shows that the top four nations were Portugal, Great Britain, France, and Spain.


==Other triangular trades==
The term &quot;triangular trade&quot; also refers to a variety of other trades.
* A triangular trade is hypothesized to have taken place among ancient East Greece (and possibly Attica), Kommos, and Egypt.
* A trade pattern which evolved before the American Revolutionary War among Great Britain, the Colonies of British North America, and British colonies in the Caribbean. This typically involved exporting raw resources, such as fish (especially salt cod), agricultural produce or lumber, from British North American colonies to slaves and planters in the West Indies; sugar and molasses from the Caribbean; and various manufactured commodities from Great Britain.
* The shipment of Newfoundland salt cod and corn from Boston in British vessels to southern Europe. This also included the shipment of wine and olive oil to Britain.
* A new &quot;sugar triangle&quot; developed in the 1820s and 1830s whereby American ships took local produce to Cuba, then brought sugar or coffee from Cuba to the Baltic coast (Russian Empire and Sweden), then bar iron and hemp back to New England.
* Ships sailing from Britain to Australia in the last third of the 19th century found a shortage of cargoes to take back to Britain. Therefore they took New South Wales coal to China and then loaded tea and silk to carry back to Britain. The clipper &quot;Thermopylae&quot; was one of the ships that sailed this triangular route. When steamships became fuel-efficient enough to cover the distances involved, they could make two trips to Australia in a year, with one returning direct to Britain with Australian wool and the other going via China. This competed with the China and Japan Conference, a cartel of steamship owners who fiercely protected their trade and won a sequence of court cases in order to do so.

<text>Spencer Fullerton Baird (; February 3, 1823 – August 19, 1887) was an American naturalist, ornithologist, ichthyologist, herpetologist, and museum curator. Baird was the first curator to be named at the Smithsonian Institution. He eventually served as assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian from 1850 to 1878, and as Secretary from 1878 until 1887. He was dedicated to expanding the natural history collections of the Smithsonian which he increased from 6,000 specimens in 1850 to over 2 million by the time of his death. He also served as the U.S. Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries from 1871 to 1887 and published over 1,000 works during his lifetime.

==Early life and education==
Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading, Pennsylvania in 1823. His mother was a member of the prominent Philadelphia Biddle family; he was a nephew of Speaker of the Pennsylvania Senate Charles B. Penrose and a first cousin, once removed, of U.S. Senator Boies Penrose and his distinguished brothers, Richard, Spencer, and Charles. He became a self-trained naturalist as a young man, learning about the field from his brother, William, who was a birder, and the likes of John James Audubon, who instructed Baird on how to draw scientific illustrations of birds. His father was also a big influence on Baird&#x27;s interest in nature, taking Baird on walks and gardening with him. He died of cholera when Baird was ten years old. As a young boy he attended Nottingham Academy in Port Deposit, Maryland and public school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

Baird attended Dickinson College and earned his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees, finishing the former in 1840. After graduation he moved to New York City with an interest in studying medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He returned to Carlisle two years later. He taught natural history at Dickinson starting in 1845. While at Dickinson, he did research, participated in collecting trips, did specimen exchanges with other naturalists, and traveled frequently. He married Mary Helen Churchill in 1846. In 1848, their daughter, Lucy Hunter Baird, was born. He was awarded a grant, in 1848, from the Smithsonian Institution to explore bone caves and the natural history of southeastern Pennsylvania. In 1849 he was given $75 by the Smithsonian Institution to collect, pack and transport specimens for them. It was during this time that he met Smithsonian Secretary Joseph Henry. The two became close friends and colleagues. Throughout the 1840s Baird traveled extensively throughout the northeastern and central United States. Often traveling by foot, Baird hiked more than 2,100 miles in 1842 alone.

==Professional career==

===Starting at the Smithsonian===
In 1850, Baird became the first curator at the Smithsonian Institution and the Permanent Secretary for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the latter which he served for three years. Upon his arrival in Washington, he brought two railroad box cars worth of his personal collection. Baird created a museum program for the Smithsonian, requesting that the organization focus on natural history in the United States. His program also allowed him to create a network of collectors through an exchange system. He asked that members of the Army and Navy collect rare animals and plant specimens from west of the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. In order to balance the collection, Baird sent duplicate specimens to other museums around the country, often exchanging the duplicates for specimens the Smithsonian needed. During the 1850s he described over 50 new species of reptiles, some by himself, and others with his student Charles Frédéric Girard. Their 1853 catalog of the Smithsonian&#x27;s snake collection is a benchmark work in North American herpetology. Baird also was a mentor to herpetologist Robert Kennicott who died prematurely, at which point Baird left the field of herpetology to focus on larger projects.

Eventually, he became the Assistant Secretary, serving under Joseph Henry. As assistant, Baird helped develop a publication and journal exchange, that provided scientists around the world with publications they would have a hard time accessing. He supported the work of William Stimpson, Robert Kennicott, Henry Ulke and Henry Bryant. Between his start as Assistant Secretary and 1855, he worked with Joseph Henry to provide scientific equipment and needs to the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey. In 1855, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He received his Ph.D. in physical science in 1856 from Dickinson College. In 1857 and 1852 he acquired the collection of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science. However, the objects did not join the permanent collection of the Smithsonian until 1858. Baird attended the funeral of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, alongside Joseph Henry. In 1870, Baird was vacationing in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he developed an interest in maritime research. He went on to lead expeditions in Nova Scotia and New England.

===United States Fish Commission and United States National Museum===

On February 25, 1871, Ulysses S. Grant appointed Baird as the first Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries for the United States Fish Commission. He served in this position until his death. With Baird as Commissioner, the commission sought opportunities to restock rivers with salmon and lakes with other food fish and the depletion of food fish in coastal waters. Baird reported that humans were the reason for the decline of food fish in these coastal areas. Individuals with access to shoreline property used weirs, or nets, to capture large amounts of fish on the coast, which threatened the supply of fish on the coast. Baird used the U.S. Fish Commission to limit human impact through a compromise by prohibiting the capture of fish in traps from 6pm on Fridays until 6pm on Mondays. The &quot;Albatross&quot; research vessel was launched during his tenure, in 1882. He was highly active in developing fishing and fishery policies for the United States, and was instrumental in making Woods Hole the research venue it is today.

Baird became the manager of the United States National Museum in 1872. Baird told George Perkins Marsh that he sought to be the director of the National Museum and that he had intentions to expand on the collections within the museum en masse. He was the primary writer of &quot;A History of North American Birds,&quot; which was published in 1874 and continues to be an important publication in ornithology today. He created all of the United States federal exhibits in the Centennial Exposition, many of which won awards. When the exposition ended, Baird was successful in persuading other exhibitors to contribute the objects from their exhibits to the Smithsonian. In total, Baird left with sixty-two boxcars filled with 4,000 cartons of objects. Owing to the large number of objects collected, in 1879, Congress approved construction for the first National Museum building, which is now the Arts and Industries Building.

===Second Secretary at the Smithsonian===
Joseph Henry died on May 13, 1878 and on May 17, Baird became the second Secretary of the Smithsonian. Baird was allowed to live, rent free, in the Smithsonian Institution Building, but declined and had the east wing converted into workspace. He also had telephones installed throughout the building. That year, he was made a member of the Order of St. Olav by the King of Sweden. In 1880 Baird was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society He oversaw the building of the new National Museum building, which opened in 1881. In September 1883, he was unanimously declared a founding member of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union even though his duties prevented him from attending their first convention. During the February 1887, Baird went on leave due to &quot;intellectual exertion&quot;. Samuel P. Langley served as Acting Secretary.

==Death and legacy==
Spencer Fullerton Baird died on August 19, 1887. Upon Baird&#x27;s death, the Arts and Industries building was draped with a mourning cloth. John Wesley Powell spoke at Baird&#x27;s funeral. Baird is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery.

Baird&#x27;s sparrow, a migratory bird native to Canada, Mexico and the United States, is named after him. A medium-sized shorebird known as Baird&#x27;s sandpiper is also named after him.

Baird Auditorium in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History is named in his honor. It is located on the National Mall side of the first floor of the museum.

Baird&#x27;s wife, Mary, donated his stamp collection to the National Museum. His papers are held in the Smithsonian Institution Archives.

In 1946, Baird was one of four Smithsonian Secretaries featured in an exhibition about their lives and work curated by United States National Museum curator Theodore T. Belote. In 1922, the Baird Ornithological Club was founded and named after Baird. Spencer Baird Road in Woods Hole is named for him.

<doc id="397880" wikidata="Q7053274" url="?curid=397880" title="Norrington Table">
<text>The Norrington Table was an annual ranking of the colleges of the University of Oxford based on a score computed from the proportions of undergraduate students earning each of the various degree classifications based on that year&#x27;s final examinations.

== Overview ==
The rankings of each college in the Norrington Table were calculated by awarding 5 points for a student who receives a First Class degree, 3 points for a 2:1, 2 for a 2:2 and 1 for a Third; the total was then divided by the maximum possible score (i.e. the number of finalists in that college multiplied by 5), and the result for each college is expressed as a percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Previously the university had refused to endorse an official table, leading to inaccuracies (see Criticisms below), so the university finally published its own rankings using examination results from all final year undergraduates in 2005.

In November 2024, the Conference of Colleges discontinued the system, stating that the Norrington Table did not &quot;encapsulate the added value given by college teaching&quot; and that &quot;it [did not] relate to differences at the level of specific degree courses.”, evidence of the system being unfit for purpose. Discussions as to a replacement system are ongoing.

== History==

Contrary to popular belief, the Norrington Table was not created in 1962 by Sir Arthur Norrington, who was then president of Trinity College. Norrington did not invent the idea of producing a table of the results of Oxford colleges. Rather, he suggested a refinement to the weightings given to results in a existing table. Norrington&#x27;s scoring system was suggested in 1963 and abandoned after 1985, owing to changes in the Oxford examination system.

On 5 September 1963, Norrington had a letter published in &quot;The Times&quot;, in which he objected to the table that their correspondent had published two days earlier (3 September 1963, p. 12). &quot;The Times&quot; had previously published a table of Oxford colleges&#x27; results in 1962 (29 August 1962, p. 5).

Norrington wrote: &quot;Your Correspondent has analysed the final examination results this year and gives an order of merit, among the first colleges, based on the percentage of Firsts and Seconds. This, in effect, is the same as basing it on the percentage of Thirds, and gives it no extra credit for Firsts. College A, for example, that gets 20 Firsts, 60 Seconds, and 20 Thirds scores less by this method than College B that gets no Firsts, 81 Seconds and 19 Thirds, but surely A has, in reality, done much better than B. A better result, I submit, is obtained by a points system in which a First scores more than a second and a Second more than a Third. If you make the points 3, 2, and 1 respectively and calculate what percentage of its &quot;possible&quot; each college has secured, you will find that College A, with 200 points out of 300, has scored 66.67 per cent, and B, with 181, only 60 per cent. This method of calculation will be found to promote Magdalen and Merton, which come surprisingly low in your Correspondent&#x27;s order.&quot; (5 September 1963, p. 13)

In 1986, when Oxford for the first time split Second Class honours into Upper Seconds and Lower Seconds, &quot;The Times&quot; unilaterally adopted the Tompkins Table, which gives more weight to a First class degree: five points for a First, three for a 2.1, two for a 2.2, and one for a Third. This system was devised in 1981 by Peter Tompkins, of Birkenhead, to classify the results of Cambridge colleges, and a table compiled by Tompkins on this basis was published on 28 August by &quot;The Times&quot; (28 Aug 1981, p. 10) alongside a table using the Norrington scoring system, which had been compiled by the &quot;Cambridge Evening News&quot;. The Tompkins Table became the preferred rating for Cambridge colleges and has prevailed for Oxford colleges as well since 1986.

=== Recent rankings ===
Below is the Norrington Table for the academic years 2021/22 and 2019/20 along with mean values for the period 2006 to 2019.
=== Past rankings ===
Norrington Table rankings from 2006 to 2019 by college, ordered by mean rank, and omitting all PPHs since they take very few undergraduates, with the exception of Regent&#x27;s Park:

== Criticisms ==
The table is biased towards colleges with above average proportions of students in science subjects such as chemistry and mathematics, in which a higher proportion attain a first-class degree compared to humanities (in which more students attain a 2:1). The corresponding Tompkins Table at Cambridge makes an adjustment for this feature.

John Lucas, Fellow of Merton, presented a critique of the Norrington Table in a 1980 article titled &quot;Norrington Blues&quot;.

==Other tables and debate over use of Norrington name==

The Norrington Table has inspired other tables ranking the performance of Oxford colleges, such as the &quot;Vegetarian Norrington Table&quot;, which was first published in 2016. A play on the original, the Vegetarian Norrington Table ranks the best and worst colleges in Oxford not for their undergraduate examination results, but for the quality of their vegetarian and vegan food, using data collected from staff and students of the University. The table caused some controversy, however, as a number of college bursars argued that it bore no relation to the original and further questioned its metrics. The current top-ranked college in the Vegetarian Norrington Table is Mansfield College, followed by Worcester College, with Kellogg College in third.

There have been attempts to rework the original Norrington Table, specifically in light of debates surrounding access and the equality of process. In 2018, one article used geographical data to rank colleges based on the percentage of undergraduate students from poorer backgrounds. In this same report, the Vice President of the Oxford University Student Union announced work was underway on an &quot;alternative Norrington Table&quot; which would seek to measure social mobility as well as academic success in colleges.

<text>Johann Friedrich von Brandt (25 May 1802 – 15 July 1879) was a German-Russian naturalist, who worked mostly in Russia.

Brandt was born in Jüterbog and educated at a gymnasium in Wittenberg and the University of Berlin.

In 1831 he emigrated to Russia, and soon was appointed director of the Zoological Museum of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Brandt encouraged the collection of native animals, many of which were not represented in the museum. Many specimens began to arrive from the expeditions of Severtzov, Przhevalsky, Middendorff, Schrenck and Gustav Radde.

He described several birds collected by Russian explorers off the Pacific Coast of North America, including Brandt&#x27;s cormorant, red-legged kittiwake and spectacled eider.

As a paleontologist, Brandt ranks among the best. He was also an entomologist, specialising in Coleoptera (beetles) and Diplopoda (millipedes).

He died in Merreküll, Governorate of Estonia.

He is also commemorated in Brandt&#x27;s bat, Brandt&#x27;s hedgehog, three other species of mammals, and the lizard &quot;Iranolacerta brandtii&quot;.

<doc id="397893" wikidata="Q2708598" url="?curid=397893" title="Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke">
<text>Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, (1 December 16906 March 1764) was an English lawyer and politician who served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. He was a close confidant of the Duke of Newcastle, Prime Minister between 1754 and 1756 and 1757 until 1762.

==Background==
A son of Philip Yorke, an attorney, he was born at Dover. Through his mother, Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Richard Gibbon of Rolvenden, Kent, he was connected with the family of Edward Gibbon the historian. He was educated at a school in Bethnal Green run by Samuel Morland, a nonconformist.

At age 16, Yorke entered the attorney&#x27;s office of Charles Salkeld in Holborn, London. He was entered at the Middle Temple in November 1708, and perhaps recommended by his employer to Lord Chief Justice Parker as law tutor to his sons.

In 1715, Yorke was called to the bar, where his progress was, according to Lord Campbell, more rapid than that of any other debutant in the annals of the profession, his advancement being greatly furthered by the patronage of Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield, who became Lord Chancellor in 1718, when Yorke transferred his practice from the King&#x27;s Bench to the Court of Chancery, though he continued to go on the Western Circuit. In the following year he established his reputation as an equity lawyer in a case in which Robert Walpole&#x27;s family was interested, by an argument displaying profound learning and research concerning the jurisdiction of the chancellor, on lines which he afterwards more fully developed in a celebrated letter to Lord Kames on the distinction between law and equity. 

Through the Earl of Macclesfield&#x27;s influence with the Duke of Newcastle Yorke entered parliament in 1719 as member for Lewes, and was appointed solicitor-general, with a knighthood, in 1720, although he was then a barrister of only four years standing.

Although in his youth he contributed to &quot;The Spectator&quot; over the signature Philip Homebred, he seems early to have abandoned all care for literature, and he has been reproached by Lord Campbell and others with his neglect of art and letters. On 16 May 1719 he married Margaret, daughter of Charles Cocks (by his wife Mary Cocks, sister of Lord Chancellor Somers) and widow of William Lygon (who died without issue in 1716), by whom he had five sons and two daughters:
* Philip Yorke, Viscount Royston (1720–1790), who succeeded him
* Hon. Charles Yorke (1722–1770), became, like his father, Lord Chancellor
* Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1725–1760), married Lord Anson
* Hon. Joseph Yorke (d. 1792), a diplomat, created Baron Dover
* Hon. John Yorke (1728–1801), Member of Parliament for Reigate and Higham Ferrers
* Hon. James Yorke (1730–1808), became Bishop of Ely
* Lady Margaret Yorke, married Sir Gilbert Heathcote, Bt
In 1739, he purchased Wimpole Hall, the greatest country house in Cambridgeshire.

He is buried, with many of his descendants, at the St. Andrew Churchyard at Wimpole. Hardwicke was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Philip. His monument was sculpted by Peter Scheemakers.

His cousin Sir William Yorke, 1st Baronet had a highly successful career as a judge in Ireland, becoming Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas.

==Career==

===Attorney-General===
The prosecution of Christopher Layer for treason as a Jacobite raised Yorke&#x27;s reputation as a forensic orator; and in 1723, having already become attorney-general, he passed through the House of Commons the bill of pains and penalties against Francis Atterbury. He was excused, on the ground of his personal friendship, from acting for the crown in the impeachment of the Earl of Macclesfield in 1725; he soon found a new patron in the Duke of Newcastle.

Lord Hardwicke is also remembered as one of the two authors of the Yorke–Talbot slavery opinion whilst he was a crown law officer in 1729. The opinion was sought to determinate the legality of slavery and Hardwicke (then Philip Yorke) and Charles Talbot opined that it was legal. The opinion was disseminated and relied upon widely. Lord Hardwicke would subsequently endorse the views in the opinion in a judicial capacity in &quot;Pearne v Lisle&quot; (1749) Amb 75, 27 ER 47. He rendered valuable service to Walpole&#x27;s government by his support of the bill for prohibiting loans to foreign powers (1730), of the increase of the army (1732) and of the Excise Bill (1733).

===Walpole government===
In 1733 Yorke was appointed Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, with the title of Lord Hardwicke, and was sworn of the Privy Council; and in 1737 he succeeded Lord Talbot as Lord Chancellor, thus becoming a member of Walpole&#x27;s cabinet. One of his first official acts was to deprive the poet James Thomson of a small office conferred on him by Talbot.

===House of Lords===
Hardwicke&#x27;s political importance was greatly increased by his move to the House of Lords, where the incompetency of Newcastle threw on the Chancellor the duty of defending the measures of the government. He resisted Carteret&#x27;s motion to reduce the army in 1738, and the resolutions hostile to Spain over the affair of Captain Jenkins&#x27;s ears. But when Walpole bent before the storm and declared war against Spain, Hardwicke advocated energetic measures for its conduct; and he tried to keep the peace between Newcastle and Walpole. He found that there was no sufficient ground for Horace Walpole&#x27;s charge that the fall of Sir Robert was brought about by Hardwicke&#x27;s treachery.

===Wilmington government===
No one was more surprised than himself when he retained the chancellorship in the following administration, and he resisted the proposal to indemnify witnesses against Walpole in one of his finest speeches in May 1742. He exercised a leading influence in the Wilmington Cabinet; and when Wilmington died in August 1743, it was Hardwicke who put forward Henry Pelham for the vacant office against the claims of Pulteney. For many years from this time he was the controlling power in the government.

During the King&#x27;s absences on the continent Hardwicke was left at the head of the council of regency; it thus fell to him to concert measures for dealing with the Jacobite rising in 1745. After Culloden he presided at the trial of the Scottish Jacobite peers, his conduct of which, though judicially impartial, was neither dignified nor generous; and he must be held partly responsible for the severity meted out to the rebels, and especially for the executions on obsolete attainders of Charles Radclyffe and (in 1753) of Archibald Cameron of Locheil. He carried out a major reform in 1746 which swept away the feudal power surviving in Scotland in the form of private heritable jurisdictions in the hands of the landed gentry. On the other hand, his legislation in 1748 for disarming the Highlanders and prohibiting the use of the tartan in their dress was vexatious without being effective. Hardwicke supported Chesterfield&#x27;s reform of the calendar in 1751; in 1753 his bill for legalizing the naturalization of Jews in England had to be dropped on account of the popular clamour it excited; but he successfully carried a Marriage Act which became the basis of subsequent legislation.

===Newcastle government===

On the death of Pelham in 1754 Hardwicke obtained for Newcastle the post of prime minister, and for reward was created earl of Hardwicke and Viscount Royston; and when in November 1756 the weakness of the ministry and the threatening aspect of foreign affairs compelled Newcastle to resign, Hardwicke retired with him. He played a part in negotiating the coalition between Newcastle and Pitt in 1757, when he accepted a seat in Pitt&#x27;s cabinet without returning to the woolsack. After the accession of George III Hardwicke opposed the ministry of Lord Bute on the peace with France in 1762, and on the cider tax in the following year. In the Wilkes case Hardwicke condemned general warrants, and also the doctrine that seditious libels published by members of parliament were protected by parliamentary privilege. He died in London on 6 March 1764.

==Influence==
In 1736 the King&#x27;s Bench, under his presidency, delivered the seminal judgment in &quot;Middleton v. Crofts&quot; 2 Atk 650, which held that canons made in the provincial clergy convocations could not, by themselves, bind the lay faithful. He held the office of Lord Chancellor longer than any of his predecessors, with a single exception. His decisions fixed limits and established principles of Equity. His influence was powerful in obliterating the traditions of the judicial bench under the Stuart monarchy, and in establishing the modern conception of the duties and demeanour of English judges. While still at the bar Lord Chesterfield praised his conduct of crown prosecutions as a contrast to the former bloodhounds of the crown; and he described Sir Philip Yorke as naturally humane, moderate and decent.

<text>Mark David Danner (born November 10, 1958) is an American writer, journalist, and educator. He is a former staff writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and frequent contributor to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. Danner specializes in U.S. foreign affairs, war and politics, and has written books and articles on Haiti, Central America, the former Yugoslavia, and the Middle East, as well as on American politics, covering every presidential election since 2000. In 1999, he was named a MacArthur Fellow.

, Danner holds the Class of 1961 Distinguished Chair in Undergraduate Education at UC Berkeley and James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs and the Humanities at Bard College.

Danner is a member of the Berkeley Collegium, the Council on Foreign Relations, the World Affairs Council of Northern California, and the Century Association, and is a fellow of the Institute of the Humanities at New York University. In 2008 he was named the Marian and Andrew Heiskell Visiting Critic at the American Academy in Rome, a post he took up again in 2010. Danner has had a longtime association with the Telluride Film Festival, where he introduces films and conducts interviews; in 2013, he was named resident curator there.

==Background and education==
Danner was born at Utica, New York. He attended Utica Free Academy, a public high school, and then Harvard, where he graduated, magna cum laude, with a degree in modern literature and aesthetics in 1981. At Harvard, he studied with Stanley Cavell, Robert Kiely, Stanley Hoffmann, and Frank Kermode, who in 1977-78 was the Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer and became Danner&#x27;s mentor and friend.

==Career==
===Early years===
After leaving Harvard, Danner joined the staff of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, where he worked as an assistant to editor Robert B. Silvers from 1981 to 1984. In 1984, he moved to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; as a senior editor. In 1986, he joined &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, where he specialized in foreign affairs and politics, writing pieces about nuclear weapons and about the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in Haiti, among other stories.

===&quot;The New Yorker&quot; and El Mozote===
In 1990, Danner joined the staff of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; shortly after the magazine published his three-part series on Haiti, &quot;A Reporter at Large: Beyond the Mountains&quot;.

On December 6, 1993, for only the second time in its history, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; devoted its entire issue to one article, Danner&#x27;s piece, &quot;The Truth of El Mozote&quot;, an investigation into the El Mozote massacre in El Salvador, thought to be one of the worst atrocities in modern Latin American history. The Mozote article became the basis for Danner&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Massacre at El Mozote: A Parable of the Cold War&quot;, which was published in 1994. &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; recognized &quot;The Massacre at El Mozote&quot; as one of its &quot;Notable Books of the Year.&quot;

===The Balkans and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;===
During the mid-1990s Danner began reporting on the wars in the Balkans, writing a series of eleven extended articles for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, which began with Danner&#x27;s cover piece, &quot;The US and the Yugoslav Catastrophe&quot; (November 20, 1997) and concluded with &quot;Kosovo: The Meaning of Victory&quot;, (July 15, 1999).

His 16,000-word essay, &quot;Marooned in the Cold War: America, the Alliance and the Quest for a Vanished World,&quot; which appeared in World Policy Journal (Fall 1997) provoked a prolonged exchange of letters and responses from Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Congressman Lee H. Hamilton, and Ambassador George F. Kennan.

===Iraq and the War on Terror===
Danner began writing about the war on terror soon after September 11, 2001, publishing &quot;The Battlefield in the American Mind&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in October of that year. He began speaking out against invading Iraq, notably in a series of debates with Christopher Hitchens, Leon Wieseltier, Michael Ignatieff, David Frum, William Kristol and others. He reported from Iraq for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in a series of lengthy dispatches including &quot;Iraq: How Not to Win a War&quot; (September 25, 2003), &quot;Delusions in Baghdad&quot; (February 12, 2004), and &quot;The War of the Imagination&quot; (December 21, 2006).

In May 2005 Danner wrote an essay for The New York Review accompanying the first American publication of the so-called &quot;Downing Street Memo&quot;, the leaked minutes of a July 2002 meeting of high-level British officials that confirmed that when it came to the debate over whether to go to war in Iraq, &quot;the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy,&quot; and that the invasion of Iraq was in fact a foregone conclusion. The essay provoked a number of responses and led to two subsequent essays, all of which were collected, along with relevant documents and a preface by &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Frank Rich, in 2006 in &quot;The Secret Way to War: the Downing Street Memo and the Iraq War&#x27;s Buried History&quot;.

In October 2016, Brian Lamb sat down with Mark Danner to talk about his latest book, &quot;Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War&quot;, which looks at the 15-year U.S. war on terrorism. The interviewed aired on C-SPAN on Oct. 27, 2016.

===Torture and Abu Ghraib===
Beginning in the spring of 2004, he wrote a series of essays for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; on the emerging torture scandal that came to be known as Abu Ghraib. In October 2004, he collected these essays and gathered them, together with a series of government documents and reports, into his book, &quot;Torture and Truth: America, Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror&quot;.

In March 2009, Danner published an essay in &quot;The New York Review&quot;, &quot;US Torture: Voices from the Black Sites&quot;, which revealed the contents of a secret International Committee of the Red Cross report based on testimony from &quot;high-value detainees&quot; in the &quot;War on Terror,&quot; who had been captured, held, and interrogated at secret US prisons—the so-called &quot;black sites&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he published a second essay, &quot;The Red Cross Report: What it Means&quot; and released the full text of the report on &quot;The New York Review&quot; website. Weeks later, President Obama ordered released four Justice Department memos in which the Bush administration purported &quot;to legalize torture.&quot; Senior Obama officials Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod claimed publicly that the memos&#x27; release was prompted by publication of the Red Cross Report.

===Mark Danner On Donald Trump===
In the spring of 2016, Danner began covering the 2016 general election for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, profiling then Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump on his campaign trail. In May, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; published &quot;The Magic of Donald Trump,&quot; and on Dec. 22, the magazine published &quot;The Real Trump.&quot;

Following the articles, Danner has appeared as a guest on multiple radio shows, including WNUR 89.3FM Chicago&#x27;s &quot;This is Hell!&quot; and KALW 91.5FM San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Your Call&quot;, to discuss Trump&#x27;s presidency. He also has sat down with Bard President Leon Botstein twice to discuss President Donald Trump&#x27;s first days in office and his approach to foreign and domestic policy.

In March 2017, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; published Danner&#x27;s &quot;What Could He Do?,&quot; which chronicles Trump&#x27;s first days in office.

Mark continued his coverage Donald Trump in the 2020 election. In October 2020, The New York Review of Books published Danner&#x27;s &quot;The Con He Rode In On,&quot; outlining the fallacies and damage of the Trump Presidency and campaign. After the 2020 election, Danner attended the Trump rally at the White House ellipse on January 6, marching to the U.S. Capitol, and reported on it in his piece &quot;Be Ready to Fight&quot;. &quot;The Slow-Motion Coup,&quot; the first in a series of essays on January 6 and Donald Trump, appeared in the New York Review of Books.

==Other works==
===Books===
In addition to &quot;The Massacre at El Mozote&quot; (1994), &quot;Torture and Truth&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Secret Way to War&quot; (2006), Danner is the author of &quot;The Road to Illegitimacy: One Reporter&#x27;s Travels through the 2000 Florida Recount&quot; (2003) and &quot;Stripping Bare the Body: Politics Violence War&quot; (2009). His most recent book is &quot;Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War,&quot; published in June 2016.

===Television and commentary===
Danner co-wrote and helped produce two-hour-long television documentaries for ABC News&#x27; Peter Jennings Reporting series: &quot;While America Watched: The Bosnian Tragedy&quot; and &quot;House on Fire: America&#x27;s Haitian Crisis&quot;, which both aired in 1994. As commentator, Danner has appeared on &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;, &quot;The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour&quot; and &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot; on PBS, CNN&#x27;s Prime News, The Situation Room, and &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Now&quot;, C-Span&#x27;s &quot;Morning Show,&quot; and &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; on MSNBC, among others.

==Academic career==
Since 2000, Danner has been a Professor of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. In 2002 he also accepted a Henry R. Luce professorship in Human Rights and Journalism at Bard College, where, in 2006, he was named the James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs and the Humanities. As of 2021, he holds the Class of 1961 Distinguished Chair in Undergraduate Education at UC Berkeley. He teaches on foreign affairs, politics, and literature, including seminars on foreign reporting, war and revolution, crisis management, Trump Abroad, Faulkner, Hemingway, Chekhov, and Tolstoy. At Bard he conducts seminars on politics and literature, including on torture, utopia, Faust, the picaresque, drone warfare, and the politics of the War on Terror. In April 2010, Danner delivered the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Stanford, entitled &quot;Torture and the Forever War: Living in the State of Exception.&quot; From 2011 to 2012, Danner taught politics and literature, including courses on the Arab Spring, on the politics of dictatorships and on drone warfare, at Al Quds University in Jerusalem.

<doc id="397900" wikidata="Q5790329" url="?curid=397900" title="Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke">
<text>Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke, PC, FRS (9 March 1720 – 16 May 1790), styled Viscount Royston between 1754 and 1764, was an English politician and writer.

==Life==
The eldest son of Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, he was educated at Newcome&#x27;s School and later Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He was appointed Teller of the Exchequer in 1738, a post he held for life. In 1741 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

He sat in the House of Commons as member for Reigate (1741–47), and afterwards for Cambridgeshire; he kept notes of the debates which were afterwards embodied in Cobbett&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary History&quot;.
During the political crisis over the loss of Minorca to the French in 1756, Lord Royston was tapped with collecting favourable press accounts of the ministry. He joined his father, as well as Lord Mansfield, to defend the Newcastle ministry during the parliamentary inquiries following the execution of Admiral John Byng.

He was styled by the courtesy title Viscount Royston from 1754 to 1764, when he succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father. He inherited the Wimpole estate, Cambridgeshire which his father had bought from Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford. On the accession of George III in 1760, Yorke was sworn of the privy council.

In politics he supported the Rockingham Whigs. He was Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire (1757 to his death) and high steward of Cambridge University. He edited a quantity of miscellaneous state papers and correspondence, to be found in manuscript collections in the British Museum. Between 1756 and 1760, he served in the honorary position of vice president of the Foundling Hospital, a charitable institution providing for London&#x27;s abandoned children.

He died in 1790 and was buried in Flitton, Bedfordshire with a monument by Thomas Banks.

==Works==
With his brother, Charles Yorke, he was one of the chief contributors to &quot;Athenian Letters; or the Epistolary Correspondence of an agent of the King of Persia residing at Athens during the Peloponnesian War&quot; (4 vols., London, 1741), a work that for many years had a considerable vogue and went through several editions.

==Marriage and children==

On 22 May 1740 he married Lady Jemima Campbell, only daughter of John Campbell, 3rd Earl of Breadalbane by his wife Lady Amabel de Grey, daughter and heiress of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent (1671–1740). On the death of her grandfather the Duke of Kent in 1740, Jemima succeeded him in her own right as the 2nd Marchioness Grey and 4th Baroness Lucas. By his wife he had two daughters and co-heiresses:
*Lady Amabel Yorke, 1st Countess de Grey (23 January 1751 – 4 March 1833), eldest daughter, who married Alexander Hume-Campbell, Lord Polwarth, childless. She succeeded her mother as 5th Baroness Lucas.
*Lady Mary Jemima Yorke (9 February 1756 – 1830), who married Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham and had issue.

==Death and succession==
He was succeeded in the earldom by his nephew Philip Yorke, 3rd Earl of Hardwicke.

<text>Boarstall is a village and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, about west of Aylesbury. The parish is on the county boundary with Oxfordshire and the village is about southeast of the Oxfordshire market town of Bicester.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Boarstall&quot; is first attested in 1158–59 as &quot;Burchestala&quot;. This derives from the Old English words (&quot;fortification, town&quot;) and (&quot;settlement, location, site&quot;). Thus it once meant &quot;site of the fort&quot;.

The parish also contains Panshill Farm, whose name is first attested in the thirteenth century in the forms &quot;Pansehale&quot;, &quot;Pauncehale&quot;, &quot;Pauncehaye&quot;, and &quot;Paunsehale&quot;. The name is noted as a likely example of an etymologically-Brittonic English place-name. It is thought to derive from the words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;head, end, top, peak&quot;) and (&quot;wood&quot;).

==History==

According to legend King Edward the Confessor gave some land to one of his men in return for slaying a wild boar that had infested the nearby Bernwood Forest. The man built himself a mansion on this land and called it &quot;Boar-stall&quot; (Old English for &#x27;Boar House&#x27;) in memory of the slain beast. The man, known as Neil, was also given a horn from the dead beast, and the legend says that whoever shall possess the horn shall be the lord of the manor of Boarstall.

It is certainly the case from manorial records of 1265 that the owner of the manor of Boarstall was the ceremonial keeper of the Bernwood Forest, suggesting a link with the earlier legend. Given the proximity of Boarstall to the king&#x27;s palace at Brill it would appear that this legend certainly has some basis in fact.

The &quot;Magna Britannia&quot; of 1806 noted that the then-current incumbent of the manor, Sir John Aubrey, was in possession of a large horn...
The manor was fortified in 1312 by the construction of a defensive gatehouse. The house was demolished in 1778 but the gatehouse, very large and grand for its time, survives relatively unaltered. Boarstall Tower, which was originally part of the 18th century house on the site, was given to the National Trust by the philanthropist Ernest Cook, founder of the Ernest Cook Trust. In the English Civil War this was made into a garrison by King Charles I who was in possession of the nearby village of Brill. When Brill fell in 1643, so did the garrison at Boarstall. However whereas the manor at Brill was destroyed in the fighting, the fortified manor at Boarstall was saved, and used as a garrison by John Hampden&#x27;s men, from which they were able to attack Royalist Oxford, away.

Having no further use for the manor in 1644, Hampden left to go and fight elsewhere. The house was then taken back for the Royalists by Colonel Henry Gage, who it is said launched such heavy fire from his cannons against the house that the incumbent Penelope, Lady Dynham was forced to evacuate and steal away in disguise. Gage left a small garrison in place to defend the house.

In May 1645 the house was attacked again by the Parliamentarian forces, this time led by Sir Thomas Fairfax, but he was unsuccessful. The following year in 1646 Fairfax returned, and the house was surrendered to him on 10 June, after a siege of 18 hours.

Ecclesiastically, Boarstall was originally a chapel of ease for nearby Oakley, and its tithes were granted by Empress Matilda to St Frideswide&#x27;s Priory in Oxford. The ecclesiastical parish of Boarstall was formed in 1418. The original parish church was mainly demolished in the English Civil War but a replacement was constructed out of funds provided by Lady Denham.

<doc id="397909" wikidata="Q5790337" url="?curid=397909" title="Philip Yorke, 3rd Earl of Hardwicke">
<text>Philip Yorke, 3rd Earl of Hardwicke (31 May 1757 – 18 November 1834), known as Philip Yorke until 1790, was a British politician.

==Background and education==
Born in Cambridge, England, he was the eldest son of Charles Yorke, Lord Chancellor, by his first wife, Catherine Freman. He was educated at Harrow and Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge.

On 31 January 1788 his uncle Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke, as Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, appointed him as Colonel of the Cambridgeshire Militia, a command which he held for many years, even after he had become Lord Lieutenant himself. 

In 1790 he succeeded his uncle to his earldom and estates, including Wimpole Hall.

==Political career==
Hardwicke was Member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire from 1780 to 1790, following the Whig traditions of his family, but after his succession to the earldom in 1790 he supported William Pitt The Younger, and took office in 1801 as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1801–1806), where he supported Catholic emancipation. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1801, created a Knight of the Garter in 1803, and was a fellow of the Royal Society.

==Family==
Lord Hardwicke married Lady Elizabeth, daughter of James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres, in 1782. They had four sons and four daughters.
* Philip Yorke, Viscount Royston (7 May 1784 – 7 April 1808), Member of Parliament for Reigate but was lost at sea off Lübeck (having died without issue);
* Lady Anne Yorke (13 April 1783 – 17 July 1870); married John Savile, 3rd Earl of Mexborough, and had issue.
* Lady Catherine Freeman Yorke (14 April 1786 – 8 July 1863); married Du Pré Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon, and had issue.
* Charles Yorke (23 August 1787 – 28 December 1791)
* Lady Elizabeth Margaret Yorke (1789 – 23 June 1867); married Charles Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay, and had issue.
* Lady Caroline Harriet Yorke (15 October 1794 – 27 May 1873); married John Somers-Cocks, 2nd Earl Somers, and had issue.
* Charles James Yorke, Viscount Royston (14 July 1797 – 30 April 1810); died at Wimpole of scarlet fever.
* Hon. Joseph John Yorke (12 August 1800 – 23 March 1801), died in infancy

Lord Hardwicke died on 18 November 1834, aged 77, and was buried St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, in a tomb by Richard Westmacott the Younger. As he had no surviving male issue, he was succeeded in the earldom by his nephew Charles. Lady Hardwicke died on 26 May 1858, aged 94.

<doc id="397917" wikidata="Q1482076" url="?curid=397917" title="Propaganda model">
<text>The propaganda model is a conceptual model in political economy advanced by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky to explain how propaganda and systemic biases function in corporate mass media. The model seeks to explain how populations are manipulated and how consent for economic, social, and political policies, both foreign and domestic, is &quot;manufactured&quot; in the public mind due to this propaganda. The theory posits that the way in which corporate media is structured (e.g. through advertising, concentration of media ownership or government sourcing) creates an inherent conflict of interest and therefore acts as propaganda for anti-democratic elements.

First presented in their 1988 book &quot;Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media&quot;, the propaganda model views corporate media as businesses interested in the sale of a product—readers and audiences—to other businesses (advertisers) rather than the pursuit of quality journalism in service of the public. Describing the media&#x27;s &quot;societal purpose&quot;, Chomsky writes, &quot;... the study of institutions and how they function must be scrupulously ignored, apart from fringe elements or a relatively obscure scholarly literature&quot;. The theory postulates five general classes of &quot;filters&quot; that determine the type of news that is presented in news media. These five classes are: ownership of the medium, the medium&#x27;s funding sources, sourcing, , and anti-communism or &quot;fear ideology&quot;.

The first three are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important. In versions published after the 9/11 attacks on the United States in 2001, Chomsky and Herman updated the fifth prong to instead refer to the &quot;War on Terror&quot; and &quot;counter-terrorism&quot;, which they state operates in much the same manner.

Although the model was based mainly on the media of the United States, Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles that the model postulates as the cause of media biases. Their assessment has been supported by a number of scholars and the propaganda role of the media has since been empirically assessed in Western Europe and Latin America.

=== Ownership ===
The size and profit-seeking imperative of dominant media corporations create a bias. The authors point to how in the early nineteenth century, a radical British press had emerged that addressed the concerns of workers, but excessive stamp duties, designed to restrict newspaper ownership to the &#x27;respectable&#x27; wealthy, began to change the face of the press. Nevertheless, there remained a degree of diversity. In post World War II Britain, radical or worker-friendly newspapers such as the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Sunday Citizen&quot; (all since failed or absorbed into other publications), and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; (at least until the late 1970s) regularly published articles questioning the capitalist system. The authors posit that these earlier radical papers were not constrained by corporate ownership and therefore, were free to criticize the capitalist system.

Herman and Chomsky argue that since mainstream media outlets are currently either large corporations or part of conglomerates (e.g. Westinghouse or General Electric), the information presented to the public will be biased with respect to these interests. Such conglomerates frequently extend beyond traditional media fields and thus have extensive financial interests that may be endangered when certain information is publicized. According to this reasoning, news items that most endanger the corporate financial interests of those who own the media will face the greatest bias and censorship.

It then follows that if to maximize profit means sacrificing news objectivity, then the news sources that ultimately survive must be fundamentally biased, with regard to news in which they have a conflict of interest.

=== Advertising ===
The second filter of the propaganda model is funding generated through advertising. Most newspapers have to attract advertising in order to cover the costs of production; without it, they would have to increase the price of their newspaper. There is fierce competition throughout the media to attract advertisers; a newspaper which gets less advertising than its competitors is at a serious disadvantage. Lack of success in raising advertising revenue was another factor in the demise of the &#x27;people&#x27;s newspapers&#x27; of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

The product is composed of the affluent readers who buy the newspaper—who also comprise the educated decision-making sector of the population—while the actual clientele served by the newspaper includes the businesses that pay to advertise their goods. According to this filter, the news is &quot;filler&quot; to get privileged readers to see the advertisements which makes up the content and will thus take whatever form is most conducive to attracting educated decision-makers. Stories that conflict with their &quot;buying mood&quot;, it is argued, will tend to be marginalized or excluded, along with information that presents a picture of the world that collides with advertisers&#x27; interests. The theory argues that the people buying the newspaper are the product which is sold to the businesses that buy advertising space; the news has only a marginal role as the product.

=== Sourcing ===
The third of Herman and Chomsky&#x27;s five filters relates to the sourcing of mass media news: &quot;The mass media are drawn into a symbiotic relationship with powerful sources of information by economic necessity and reciprocity of interest.&quot; Even large media corporations such as the BBC cannot afford to place reporters everywhere. They concentrate their resources where news stories are likely to happen: the White House, the Pentagon, 10 Downing Street and other central news &quot;terminals&quot;. Although British newspapers may occasionally complain about the &quot;spin-doctoring&quot; of New Labour, for example, they are dependent upon the pronouncements of &quot;the Prime Minister&#x27;s personal spokesperson&quot; for government news. Business corporations and trade organizations are also trusted sources of stories considered newsworthy. Editors and journalists who offend these powerful news sources, perhaps by questioning the veracity or bias of the furnished material, can be threatened with the denial of access to their media life-blood - fresh news. Thus, the media has become reluctant to run articles that will harm corporate interests that provide them with the resources that they depend upon.

This relationship also gives rise to a &quot;moral division of labor&quot; where &quot;officials have and give the facts&quot; and &quot;reporters merely get them&quot;. Journalists are then supposed to adopt an uncritical attitude that makes it possible for them to accept corporate values without experiencing cognitive dissonance.

=== Flak ===
The fourth filter is &#x27;flak&#x27; (not to be confused with flack which means promoters or publicity agents), described by Herman and Chomsky as &#x27;negative responses to a media statement or [TV or radio] program. It may take the form of letters, telegrams, phone calls, petitions, lawsuits, speeches and Bills before Congress and other modes of complaint, threat and punitive action&#x27;. Business organizations regularly come together to form flak machines. An example is the US-based Global Climate Coalition (GCC), comprising fossil fuel and automobile companies such as Exxon, Texaco and Ford. The GCC was conceived by Burson-Marsteller, one of the world&#x27;s largest public relations companies, to attack the credibility of climate scientists and &#x27;scare stories&#x27; about global warming.

For Chomsky and Herman &quot;flak&quot; refers to negative responses to a media statement or program. The term &quot;flak&quot; has been used to describe what Chomsky and Herman see as efforts to discredit organizations or individuals who disagree with or cast doubt on the prevailing assumptions which Chomsky and Herman view as favorable to established power (e.g., &quot;The Establishment&quot;). Unlike the first three &quot;filtering&quot; mechanisms—which are derived from analysis of market mechanisms—flak is characterized by concerted efforts to manage public information.

===Anti-Communism and fear===
The fifth and final news filter that Herman and Chomsky identified was &#x27;anti-communism&#x27;. &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; was written during the Cold War. Chomsky updated the model as &quot;fear&quot;, often as &#x27;the enemy&#x27; or an &#x27;evil dictator&#x27; such as Colonel Gaddafi, Paul Biya, Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, or Vladimir Putin. This is exemplified in British tabloid headlines of &#x27;Smash Saddam!&#x27; and &#x27;Clobba Slobba!&#x27;. The same is said to extend to mainstream reporting of environmentalists as &#x27;eco-terrorists&#x27;. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ran a series of articles in 1999 accusing activists from the non-violent direct action group Reclaim The Streets of stocking up on CS gas and stun guns.

Anti-ideologies exploit public fear and hatred of groups that pose a potential threat, either real, exaggerated or imagined. Communism once posed the primary threat according to the model. Communism and socialism were portrayed by their detractors as endangering freedoms of speech, movement, the press and so forth. They argue that such a portrayal was often used as a means to silence voices critical of elite interests. Chomsky argues that since the end of the Cold War (1991), anticommunism was replaced by the &quot;War on Terror&quot;, as the major social control mechanism: &quot;Anti-communism has receded as an ideological factor in the Western media, but it is not dead... The &#x27;war on terror&#x27; has provided a useful substitute for the Soviet Menace.&quot; Following the events of September 11, 2001, some scholars agree that Islamophobia is replacing anti-communism as a new source of public fear. Herman and Chomsky noted, in an interview given in 2009, that the popularity of &#x27;anti-communism&#x27; as a news filter is slowly decreasing in favor of other more contemporary ideologies such as &#x27;anti-terrorism&#x27;.

== Case examples ==
Following the theoretical exposition of the propaganda model, &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; contains a large section where the authors seek to test their hypotheses. If the propaganda model is right and the filters do influence media content, a particular form of bias would be expected—one that systematically favors corporate interests.

They also looked at what they perceived as naturally occurring &quot;historical control groups&quot; where two events, similar in their properties but differing in the expected media attitude towards them, are contrasted using objective measures such as coverage of key events (measured in column inches) or editorials favoring a particular issue (measured in number).

===Coverage of &quot;enemy&quot; countries===
Examples of bias given by the authors include the failure of the media to question the legality of the Vietnam War while greatly emphasizing the Soviet–Afghan War as an act of aggression.

Other biases include a propensity to emphasize violent acts such as genocide more in enemy or unfriendly countries such as Kosovo while ignoring greater genocide in allied countries such as the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. This bias is also said to exist in foreign elections, giving favorable media coverage to fraudulent elections in allied countries such as El Salvador and Guatemala, while unfavorable coverage is given to legitimate elections in enemy countries such as Nicaragua.

Chomsky also asserts that the media accurately covered events such as the Battle of Fallujah but because of an ideological bias, it acted as pro-government propaganda. In describing coverage of raid on Fallujah General Hospital he stated that &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;accurately recorded the battle of Fallujah but it was celebrated... it was a celebration of ongoing war crimes&quot;. The article in question was &quot;Early Target of Offensive Is a Hospital&quot;.

===Scandals of leaks===
The authors point to biases that are based on only reporting scandals which benefit a section of power, while ignoring scandals that hurt the powerless. The biggest example of this was how the US media greatly covered the Watergate Scandal but ignored the COINTELPRO exposures. While the Watergate break-in was a political threat to powerful people (Democrats), COINTELPRO harmed average citizens and went as far as political assassination. Other examples include coverage of the Iran–Contra affair by only focusing on people in power such as Oliver North but omitting coverage of the civilians killed in Nicaragua as the result of aid to the Contras.

In a 2010 interview, Chomsky compared media coverage of the Afghan War Diaries and lack of media coverage of a study of severe health problems in Fallujah. While there was ample coverage of the Afghan War Diaries there was no American coverage of the Fallujah study, in which the health situation in Fallujah was described by the British media as &quot;worse than Hiroshima&quot;.

== Applications ==
Since the publication of &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot;, Herman and Chomsky have adopted the theory and have given it a prominent role in their writings, lectures and theoretical frameworks. Chomsky has made extensive use of its explanative power to lend support to his interpretations of mainstream media attitudes towards a wide array of events, including the following:
* Gulf War (1990), the media&#x27;s failure to report on Saddam&#x27;s peace offers.
* Iraq invasion (2003), the media&#x27;s failure to report on the legality of the war despite overwhelming public opinion in favor of only invading Iraq with UN authorization. According to the liberal watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting, there was a disproportionate focus on pro-war sources while total anti-war sources only made up 10% of the media (with only 3% of US sources being anti-war).
* Global warming, a 2004 study found that the media gives near equal balance to people who deny climate change despite only &quot;about one percent&quot; of climate scientists taking this view. Chomsky commented that there are &quot;three sides&quot; on climate change (deniers, those who follow the scientific consensus, and people who think that the consensus underestimates the threat from global warming), but in framing the debate the media usually ignore people who say that the scientific consensus is unduly optimistic.

==Reception==
On the rare occasions the propaganda model is discussed in the mainstream media there is usually a large reaction. In 1988, when Chomsky was interviewed by Bill Moyers, there were 1,000 letters in response, one of the biggest written reactions in the show&#x27;s history. When he was interviewed by TV Ontario, the show generated 31,321 call-ins, which was a new record for the station.
In 1996, when Chomsky was interviewed by Andrew Marr the producer commented that the response was &quot;astonishing&quot;. He commented that &quot;[t]he audience reaction was astonishing... I have never worked on a programme which elicited so many letters and calls&quot;.

In May 2007, Chomsky and Herman spoke at the University of Windsor in Canada summarizing developments and responding to criticisms related to the model. Both authors stated they felt the propaganda model is still applicable (Herman said even more so than when it was introduced), although they did suggest a few areas where they believe it falls short and needs to be extended in light of recent developments.

Chomsky has insisted that while the propaganda role of the media &quot;is intensified by ownership and advertising&quot; the problem mostly lies with &quot;ideological-doctrinal commitments that are part of intellectual life&quot; or intellectual culture of the people in power. He compares the media to scholarly literature which he says has the same problems even without the constraints of the propaganda model.

At the Windsor talk, Chomsky pointed out that Edward S. Herman was primarily responsible for creating the theory although Chomsky supported it. According to Chomsky, he insisted Herman&#x27;s name appear first on the cover of &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; because of his primary role researching and developing the theory.

===Harvard media torture study===
In April 2010, a study conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School showed that media outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stopped using the term &quot;torture&quot; for waterboarding when the US government committed it, from 2002 to 2008. It also noted that the press was &quot;much more likely to call waterboarding torture if a country other than the United States is the perpetrator.&quot; The study was similar to media studies done in &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; for topics such as comparing how the term &quot;genocide&quot; is used in the media when referring to allied and enemy countries. Glenn Greenwald said that &quot;We don&#x27;t need a state-run media because our media outlets volunteer for the task...&quot; and commented that the media often act as propaganda for the government without coercion.

===Studies of media outside the United States===
Chomsky has commented in the &quot;ChomskyChat Forum&quot; on the applicability of the Propaganda Model to the media environment of other countries: 
That&#x27;s only rarely been done in any systematic way. There is work on the British media, by a good U[niversity] of Glasgow media group. And interesting work on British Central America coverage by Mark Curtis in his book &quot;Ambiguities of Power&quot;. There is work on France, done in Belgium mostly, also a recent book by Serge Halimi (editor of &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;). There is one very careful study by a Dutch graduate student, applying the methods Ed Herman used in studying US media reaction to elections (El Salvador, Nicaragua) to 14 major European newspapers. ... Interesting results. Discussed a bit (along with some others) in a footnote in chapter 5 of my book &quot;Deterring Democracy&quot;, if you happen to have that around.
For more than a decade, a British-based website Media Lens has examined their domestic broadcasters and liberal press. Its criticisms are featured in the books &quot;Guardians of Power&quot; (2006) and &quot;Newspeak in the 21st Century&quot; (2009).

Studies have also expanded the propaganda model to examine news media in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and for film production in Hollywood.

====&quot;News of the World&quot;====
In July 2011, the journalist Paul Mason, then working for the BBC, pointed out that the News International phone hacking scandal threw light on close links between the press and politicians. However, he argued that the closure of the mass-circulation newspaper &quot;News of the World&quot;, which took place after the scandal broke, conformed only partly to the propaganda model. He drew attention to the role of social media, saying that &quot;large corporations pulled their advertising&quot; because of the &quot;scale of the social media response&quot; (a response which was mainly to do with the newspaper&#x27;s behaviour towards Milly Dowler, although Mason did not go into this level of detail).

Mason praised &quot;The Guardian&quot; for having told the truth about the phone-hacking, but expressed doubt about the financial viability of the newspaper.
One part of the Chomsky doctrine has been proven by exception. He stated that newspapers that told the truth could not make money. &quot;The Guardian&quot;...is indeed burning money and may run out of it in three years&#x27; time.

==Criticism==
=== &quot;The Anti-Chomsky Reader&quot; ===
Eli Lehrer of the American Enterprise Institute criticized the theory in &quot;The Anti-Chomsky Reader&quot;. According to Lehrer, the fact that papers like &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; have disagreements is evidence that the media is not a monolithic entity. Lehrer also believes that the media cannot have a corporate bias because it reports on and exposes corporate corruption. Lehrer asserts that the model amounts to a Marxist conception of right-wing false consciousness.

Herman and Chomsky have asserted that the media &quot;is not a solid monolith&quot; but that it represents a debate between powerful interests while ignoring perspectives that challenge the &quot;fundamental premises&quot; of all these interests. For instance, during the Vietnam War there was disagreement among the media over tactics, but the broader issue of the legality and legitimacy of the war was ignored (see Coverage of &quot;enemy&quot; countries). Chomsky has said that while the media are against corruption, they are not against society legally empowering corporate interests which is a reflection of the powerful interests that the model would predict. The authors have also said that the model does not seek to address &quot;the effects of the media on the public&quot; which might be ineffective at shaping public opinion. Edward Herman has said &quot;critics failed to comprehend that the propaganda model is about how the media work, not how effective they are&quot;.

===&quot;Inroads: A Journal of Opinion&quot;===
Gareth Morley argues in an article in &quot;Inroads: A Journal of Opinion&quot; that widespread coverage of Israeli mistreatment of protesters as compared with little coverage of similar (or much worse) events in sub-Saharan Africa is poorly explained. This was in response to Chomsky&#x27;s assertion that in testing the Model, examples should be carefully paired to control reasons for discrepancies not related to political bias. Chomsky himself cites the examples of government mis-treatment of protesters and points out that general coverage of the two areas compared should be similar, raising the point that they are not: news from Israel (in any form) is far more common than news from sub-Saharan Africa. Morley considers this approach dubiously empirical.

===&quot;The New York Times&quot; review===
Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the historian Walter LaFeber criticized the book &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; for overstating its case, in particular with regards to reporting on Nicaragua and not adequately explaining how a powerful propaganda system would let military aid to the Contra rebels be blocked. Herman responded in a letter by stating that the system was not &quot;all powerful&quot; and that LaFeber did not address their main point regarding Nicaragua. LaFeber replied that:
Mr. Herman wants to have it both ways: to claim that leading American journals &quot;mobilize bias&quot; but object when I cite crucial examples that weaken the book&#x27;s thesis. If the news media are so unqualifiedly bad, the book should at least explain why so many publications (including my own) can cite their stories to attack President Reagan&#x27;s Central American policy.

Chomsky responds to LaFeber&#x27;s reply in &quot;Necessary Illusions&quot;:
What is more, a propaganda model is not weakened by the discovery that with careful and critical reading, material could be unearthed in the media that could be used by those that objected to &quot;President Reagan&#x27;s Central American policy&quot; on grounds of principle, opposing not its failures but its successes: the near destruction of Nicaragua and the blunting of the popular forces that threatened to bring democracy and social reform to El Salvador, among other achievements.

<doc id="397918" wikidata="Q4931469" url="?curid=397918" title="Boarstall Tower">
<text>Boarstall Tower is a 14th-century moated gatehouse located in Boarstall, Buckinghamshire, England, and now, with its surrounding gardens, a National Trust property.

Until March 2020, the National Trust offered tours on Wednesday afternoons. The tower was closed during the Covid pandemic but recently reopened for selective dates in the summer.

==History==
According to legend King Edward the Confessor gave some land to one of his men in return for slaying a wild boar that had infested the nearby Bernwood Forest. The man built himself a mansion on this land and called it &quot;Boar-stall&quot; (Old English for &#x27;Boar House&#x27;) in memory of the slain beast. The man, known as Neil, was also given a horn from the dead beast, and the legend says that whoever shall possess the horn shall be the lord of the manor of Boarstall.

Manorial records of 1265 show that the owner of the manor of Boarstall was the ceremonial keeper of the Bernwood Forest, suggesting a link with the earlier legend.

The manor was fortified in 1312 by the construction of a defensive gatehouse. The house was demolished in 1778 but the gatehouse, very large and grand for its time, survives relatively unaltered. In the English Civil War this was made into a garrison by King Charles I who was in possession of the nearby village of Brill. When Brill fell in 1643, so did the garrison at Boarstall. However whereas the manor at Brill was destroyed in the fighting, the fortified manor at Boarstall was saved, and used as a garrison by John Hampden&#x27;s men, from which they were able to attack Royalist Oxford, away.

Having no further use for the manor in 1644, Hampden left to go and fight elsewhere. The house was then taken back for the Royalists by Colonel Henry Gage, whom it is said launched such heavy fire from his cannons against the house that the incumbent Penelope, Lady Dynham, was forced to evacuate and steal away in disguise. Gage left a small garrison in place to defend the house.

In May 1645 the house was attacked again by the Parliamentarian forces, this time led by Sir Thomas Fairfax, but he was unsuccessful. The following year in 1646 Fairfax returned, and the house was surrendered to him on 10 June, after a siege of 18 hours. The Dynham family later recovered possession of Boarstall; they were fortunate in having relatives who were close to Oliver Cromwell.

The &quot;Magna Britannia&quot; of 1806 noted that the current incumbent of the manor, Sir John Aubrey, 6th Baronet, was in possession of a large horn
&quot;&quot;of a dark brown colour, variegated and veined like tortoise-shell. It is two feet four inches in length, on the convex bend, the diameter of the larger end is three inches; at each end it is tipt with silver, gilt, and has a wreath of leather, by which it is hung about the neck&quot;.&quot;

Boarstall Tower was given to the National Trust by the philanthropist Ernest Cook, founder of the Ernest Cook Trust.

<doc id="397919" wikidata="Q5083776" url="?curid=397919" title="Charles Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke">
<text>Admiral Charles Philip Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke, PC (2 April 1799 – 17 September 1873) was a British naval commander and Conservative politician.

==Background==
Born at Sydney Lodge, in Hamble le Rice, Hardwicke was the eldest son of Admiral Sir Joseph Sydney Yorke, second son of Charles Yorke, Lord Chancellor, by his second wife, Agneta Johnson. He was a nephew of Philip Yorke, 3rd Earl of Hardwicke. He was educated at Harrow and at the Royal Naval College, where he was awarded the second medal.

==Naval career==
Hardwicke entered the Royal Navy in May 1815 as midshipman on , the flagship at Spithead. Later, he served in the Mediterranean, on (18) and (74) then subsequently (100), the flagship of Lord Exmouth, by whom he was entrusted with the command of a gunboat at the bombardment of Algiers. He later joined (60) under the flag of Sir David Milne, on the North American station, where he was given the command of the &quot;Jane&quot;, a small vessel carrying dispatches between Halifax and Bermuda. He was then appointed acting lieutenant of (18) and after a few months commissioned in the rank of lieutenant in August 1819. The next October, he joined the frigate on the Halifax station, until appointed to the command of in 1823 on the Mediterranean station, in this post he was employed, before and after he obtained the rank of captain in 1825, in watching the movements of the Turko-Egyptian forces and in the suppression of piracy.

Between 1828 and 1831, he took command of (28), on the same station and took an active part in the naval operation in connection with the struggle between Greece and Turkey. Lastly, between 1844 and 1845, for short periods, he assumed command of the steam yacht HMS &quot;Black Eagle&quot; and (120), in which he carried the Emperor of Russia, Nicholas I, to England. He attained flag rank in 1838. In 1849, while commanding , he acted as a mediator between the Mazzinian rebel and the Kingdom of Sardinia during the rebellion in Genoa following the defeat during the First War of Independence. For this actions, he was decorated by the Sardinian King Victor Emmanuel II with a Gold Medal of Military Valour, which he was authorized to accept by Queen Victoria only in 1855. In 1858, he retired from the active list with the rank of rear-admiral, becoming vice-admiral in the same year, and admiral in 1863. He retired from the Royal Navy in 1870.

==Political career==

Hardwicke represented Reigate in the House of Commons between 1831 and 1832 and Cambridgeshire between 1832 and 1834. In 1834, on the death of his uncle, he became the fourth Earl of Hardwicke, and inherited the substantial Wimpole estate in Cambridgeshire. He was a member of Lord Derby&#x27;s cabinet in 1852 as Postmaster General and as Lord Privy Seal between 1858 and 1859. In 1852 he was sworn of the Privy Council.

==Marriage and issue==
Hardwicke married the Hon. Susan Liddell, sixth daughter of Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth, in August 1833. They had five sons and three daughters:

*Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1834–1916), activist and courtier; married in 1860 to Henry Adeane (died 1870) and in 1877 to Michael Biddulph, 1st Baron Biddulph
*Charles Phillip, Viscount Royston (1836–1897), succeeded as 5th Earl of Hardwicke, father of Albert Yorke, 6th Earl of Hardwicke
*Lady Mary Catherine Yorke (19 May 1837 – 14 December 1890), married in 1857 William George Craven (nephew of 2nd Earl of Craven); their daughter Isabel Sophie married Charles Gordon-Lennox, 7th Duke of Richmond.
*Lady Agneta Harriet Yorke (1838–1919), courtier; married Rear Admiral Victor Montagu and was mother of George Montagu, 9th Earl of Sandwich 
*Capt. John Manners Yorke (1840–1909), succeeded his nephew Albert as 7th Earl of Hardwicke
*Lt. Hon. Victor Alexander Yorke (24 March 1842 – 23 December 1867), Royal Artillery, died suddenly aged 25
*Hon. Eliot Constantine Yorke (13 July 1843 – 21 December 1878), equerry to Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, married in 1873 Anne de Rothschild, second daughter of Sir Anthony de Rothschild, 1st Baronet and Lady Louise de Rothschild
*Hon. Alexander &quot;Alick&quot; Grantham Yorke (20 November 1847 – 17 March 1911), equerry to King Edward VII and groom-in-waiting to Queen Victoria 

Hardwicke died in September 1873, aged 74, and was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Charles. The Countess of Hardwicke died in November 1886.

===Illegitimate children===

The Earl is alleged to have fathered an illegitimate child, James Pratt, by a local girl named Charlotte Pratt, a servant at his Wimpole Hall home. Charlotte got married in 1849 to Wimpole farmhand, John Rumbold, and the following was noted in Pratt&#x27;s baptism record from 2 April 1848 (presumably by local genealogist Thomas Peter Roysse Layng, who transcribed the parish registers in 1982):

18-year-old servant girl Charlotte gave birth to a son, James Pratt, who was baptised at Wimpole on the 2 April 1848. The father was understood to have been her employer, the 4th Earl of Hardwicke. The following year, the Earl arranged a marriage for Charlotte with one John Rumbold in return for a cottage at Brick End and financial support for the child. John and Charlotte stayed married for 40 years and are buried together in Wimpole Churchyard.

Rev. Alexander Campbell Yorke, Rector of Fowlmere in Cambridgeshire, and a great-nephew of the 4th Earl, recalled Charlotte in his memoir &quot;Wimpole As I Knew It&quot; — &quot;Charlotte... was a Pratt; and she was a picture. The handsomest woman that I ever remember to have seen. In harvest time to see her swinging along the road with a bundle of corn balanced on her head, both arms akimbo, was a study in colour, figure and poise&quot;.

There is further speculation that in 1856 Hardwicke, again, fathered an illegitimate child by a Wimpole Hall servant girl, Daphne Whitby. Daphne gave birth to Charles Whitby on 7 February 1856, his baptism was registered at the estate church, St Andrew&#x27;s, on 1 June 1856. The entry in the parish register reads... &#x27;Charles Whitby, son of (blank) and Daphne Whitby, spinster of Wimpole parish.&#x27; Daphne went on to marry widower Job Male, a labourer at Wimpole Hall, in April 1857.

<doc id="397920" wikidata="Q2723587" url="?curid=397920" title="Expulsion of the Acadians">
<text>The Expulsion of the Acadians was the forced removal of inhabitants of the North American region historically known as &quot;Acadia&quot; between 1755 and 1764 by Great Britain. It included the modern Canadian Maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, along with part of the US state of Maine. The Expulsion occurred during the French and Indian War, the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

Prior to 1758, Acadians were deported to the Thirteen Colonies, then later transported to either Britain or France. Of an estimated 14,100 Acadians, approximately 11,500 were deported, of whom 5,000 died of disease, starvation or shipwrecks. Their land was given to settlers loyal to Britain, mostly immigrants from New England and Scotland. The event is largely regarded as a crime against humanity, though the modern-day use of the term &quot;genocide&quot; is debated by scholars. A census of 1764 indicates 2,600 Acadians remained in the colony, having eluded capture.

In 1710, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the British captured Port Royal, the capital of Acadia. The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht ceded the territory to Great Britain while allowing the Acadians to keep their lands. Reluctant to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain, over the following decades some participated in French military operations and helped maintain supply lines to the French fortresses of Louisbourg and Beauséjour. As a result, the British sought to eliminate any future military threat posed by the Acadians and to permanently cut the supply lines they provided to Louisbourg by removing them from the area.

Without differentiating between those who had remained neutral and those who took up arms, the British governor Charles Lawrence and the Nova Scotia Council ordered all Acadians to be expelled. In the first wave of the expulsion, Acadians were deported to other British North American colonies. During the second wave, they were deported to Britain and France, and from there a significant number migrated to Spanish Louisiana, where &quot;Acadians&quot; eventually became &quot;Cajuns&quot;. Acadians fled initially to Francophone colonies such as Canada, the uncolonized northern part of Acadia, Île Saint-Jean (now Prince Edward Island), and Île Royale (now Cape Breton Island). During the second wave of the expulsion, these Acadians were either imprisoned or deported.

Along with the British achieving their military goals of destroying the fortress of Louisbourg and weakening the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Acadian militias, the result of the Expulsion was the devastation of both a primarily civilian population and the economy of the region. Thousands of Acadians died in the expulsions, mainly from diseases and drowning when ships were lost. On July 11, 1764, the British government passed an order-in-council to permit Acadians to return to British territories in small isolated groups, provided that they take an unqualified oath of allegiance. Today Acadians live primarily in eastern New Brunswick and some regions of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Quebec and northern Maine. American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow memorialized the expulsion in the popular 1847 poem, &quot;Evangeline&quot;, about the plight of a fictional character, which spread awareness of the expulsion.

== Historical context ==
After the British gained control of Acadia in 1713, the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of loyalty to become British subjects. Instead, they negotiated a conditional oath that promised neutrality. They also worried that signing the oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime and that it would be perceived by their Mi&#x27;kmaq neighbours and allies as an acknowledgement of the British claim to Acadia, putting villages at risk of attack from the Miꞌkmaq.

Other Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath because they were anti-British. Various historians have observed that some Acadians were labelled &quot;neutral&quot; when they were not. By the time of the Expulsion of the Acadians, there was already a long history of political and military resistance by Acadians and the Wabanaki Confederacy to the British occupation of Acadia. The Miꞌkmaq and the Acadians were allies through numerous inter-marriages during the previous century. While the Acadians were the largest population, the Wabanaki Confederacy, particularly the Miꞌkmaq, held the military strength in Acadia even after the British conquest. They resisted the British occupation and were joined on numerous occasions by Acadians. These efforts were often supported and led by French priests in the region. The Wabanaki Confederacy and Acadians fought against the British in six wars, including the French and Indian Wars, Father Rale&#x27;s War and Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War, over a period of 75 years.

=== Seven Years&#x27; War ===
In 1753, French troops from Canada marched south and seized and fortified the Ohio Valley. Britain protested the invasion and claimed Ohio for itself. On May 28, 1754, the war began with the Battle of Jumonville Glen. French Officer Ensign de Jumonville and a third of his escort were killed by a British patrol led by George Washington. In retaliation the French and the Native Americans defeated the British at Fort Necessity. Washington lost a third of his force and surrendered. Major General Edward Braddock&#x27;s troops were defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela, and Major General William Johnson&#x27;s troops stopped the French advance at Lake George.

In Acadia, the primary British objective was to defeat the French fortifications at Beauséjour and Louisbourg and to prevent future attacks from the Wabanaki Confederacy, French and Acadians on the northern New England border. (There was a long history of these attacks from Acadia – see the Northeast Coast Campaigns 1688, 1703, 1723, 1724, 1745, 1746, 1747.) The British saw the Acadians&#x27; allegiance to the French and the Wabanaki Confederacy as a military threat. Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War had created the conditions for total war; British civilians had not been spared and, as Governor Charles Lawrence and the Nova Scotia Council saw it, Acadian civilians had provided intelligence, sanctuary, and logistical support while others had fought against the British. During Le Loutre&#x27;s war, to protect the British settlers from attacks along the former border of New England and Acadia, the Kennebec River, the British built Fort Halifax (Winslow), Fort Shirley (Dresden, formerly Frankfurt) and Fort Western (Augusta).

After the British capture of Beauséjour, the plan to capture Louisbourg included cutting trade to the Fortress in order to weaken the Fortress and, in turn, weaken the French ability to supply the Miꞌkmaq in their warfare against the British. According to historian Stephen Patterson, more than any other single factor – including the massive assault that eventually forced the surrender of Louisbourg – the supply problem brought an end to French power in the region. Lawrence realized he could reduce the military threat and weaken Fortress Louisbourg by deporting the Acadians, thus cutting off supplies to the fort. During the expulsion, French Officer Charles Deschamps de Boishébert led the Miꞌkmaq and the Acadians in a guerrilla war against the British. According to Louisbourg&#x27;s account books, by late 1756 the French had regularly dispensed supplies to 700 natives. From 1756 to the fall of Louisbourg in 1758, the French made regular payments to Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope and other natives for British scalps.

== British deportation campaigns ==
Once the Acadians refused to sign an oath of allegiance to Britain, which would make them loyal to the crown, the British Lieutenant Governor, Charles Lawrence, as well as the Nova Scotia Council on July 28, 1755, made the decision to deport the Acadians. The British deportation campaigns began on August 11, 1755. Throughout the expulsion, Acadians and the Wabanaki Confederacy continued a guerrilla war against the British in response to British aggression which had been continuous since 1744 (see King George&#x27;s War and Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War).

=== Bay of Fundy (1755) ===
The first wave of the expulsion began on August 10, 1755, with the Bay of Fundy Campaign during the French and Indian War. The British ordered the expulsion of the Acadians after the Battle of Beausejour (1755). The campaign started at Chignecto and then quickly moved to Grand-Pré, Piziquid (Falmouth/Windsor, Nova Scotia) and finally Annapolis Royal.

On November 17, 1755, George Scott took 700 troops, attacked twenty houses at Memramcook, arrested the remaining Acadians and killed two hundred head of livestock to deprive the French of supplies. Acadians tried to escape the expulsion by retreating to the St. John and Petitcodiac rivers, and the Miramichi in New Brunswick. The British cleared the Acadians from these areas in the later campaigns of Petitcodiac River, Saint John River, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1758.

The Acadians and Miꞌkmaq resisted in the Chignecto region and were victorious in the Battle of Petitcodiac (1755). In the spring of 1756, a wood-gathering party from Fort Monckton (former Fort Gaspareaux) was ambushed and nine were scalped. In April 1757, the same band of Acadian and Miꞌkmaw partisans raided Fort Edward and Fort Cumberland near present-day Jolicure, New Brunswick, killing and scalping two men and taking two prisoners. July 20, 1757, some Miꞌkmaq killed 23 and captured two of Gorham&#x27;s rangers outside Fort Cumberland. In March 1758, forty Acadians and Miꞌkmaq attacked a schooner at Fort Cumberland and killed its master and two sailors. In the winter of 1759, the Miꞌkmaq ambushed five British soldiers on patrol while they were crossing a bridge near Fort Cumberland. They were ritually scalped and their bodies mutilated as was common in frontier warfare. During the night of April 4, 1759, a force of Acadians and French in canoes captured the transport. At dawn they attacked the ship &quot;Moncton&quot; and chased it for five hours down the Bay of Fundy. Although &quot;Moncton&quot; escaped, one of its crew was killed and two were wounded.

In September 1756, a group of 100 Acadians ambushed a party of thirteen soldiers who were working outside Fort Edward at Piziquid. Seven were taken prisoner and six escaped back to the fort. In April 1757, a band of Acadian and Miꞌkmaw partisans raided a warehouse near Fort Edward, killed thirteen British soldiers, took what provisions they could carry and set fire to the building. Days later, the same partisans raided Fort Cumberland. By November 1756, French Officer Lotbinière wrote about the difficulty of recapturing Fort Beausejour: &quot;The English have deprived us of a great advantage by removing the French families that were settled there on their different plantations; thus we would have to make new settlements.&quot;

The Acadians and Mi&#x27;kmaq fought in the Annapolis region. They were victorious in the Battle of Bloody Creek (1757). Acadians being deported from Annapolis Royal on the ship &quot;Pembroke&quot; rebelled against the British crew, took over the ship and sailed to land. In December 1757, while cutting firewood near Fort Anne, John Weatherspoon was captured by Natives—presumably Miꞌkmaq— and was carried away to the mouth of the Miramichi River, from where he was sold or traded to the French, taken to Quebec and was held until late in 1759 and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, when General Wolfe&#x27;s forces prevailed.
Approximately 55 Acadians, who escaped the initial deportation at Annapolis Royal, are reported to have made their way to the Cape Sable region—which included south western Nova Scotia—from where they participated in numerous raids on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. The Acadians and Miꞌkmaq raided the Lunenburg settlement nine times over a three-year period during the war. Boishebert ordered the first Raid on Lunenburg (1756). In 1757, the second raid on Lunenburg occurred, in which six people from the Brisson family were killed. The following year, March 1758, there was a raid on the Lunenburg Peninsula at the Northwest Range (present-day Blockhouse, Nova Scotia) when five people from the Ochs and Roder families were killed. By the end of May 1758, most of those on the Lunenburg Peninsula had abandoned their farms and retreated to the protection of the fortifications around the town of Lunenburg, losing the season for sowing their grain.

For those who did not leave their farms, the number of raids intensified. During the summer of 1758, there were four raids on the Lunenburg Peninsula. On July 13, 1758, one person on the LaHave River at Dayspring was killed and another seriously wounded by a member of the Labrador family. The next raid happened at Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia on August 24, 1758, when eight Miꞌkmaq attacked the family homes of Lay and Brant. They killed three people in the raid, but were unsuccessful in taking their scalps, a common practice for payment from the French. Two days later, two soldiers were killed in a raid on the blockhouse at LaHave, Nova Scotia. On September 11, a child was killed in a raid on the Northwest Range. Another raid happened on March 27, 1759, in which three members of the Oxner family were killed. The last raid happened on April 20, 1759, at Lunenburg, when the Miꞌkmaq killed four settlers who were members of the Trippeau and Crighton families.

=== Cape Sable ===

The Cape Sable campaign involved the British removing Acadians from present-day Shelburne County and Yarmouth County. In April 1756, Major Jedidiah Preble and his New England troops, on their return to Boston, raided a settlement near Port La Tour and captured 72 men, women and children. In the late summer of 1758, Major Henry Fletcher led the 35th regiment and a company of Gorham&#x27;s Rangers to Cape Sable. He cordoned off the cape and sent his men through it. One hundred Acadians and Father Jean Baptistee de Gray surrendered, while about 130 Acadians and seven Miꞌkmaq escaped. The Acadian prisoners were taken to Georges Island in Halifax Harbour.

En route to the St. John River Campaign in September 1758, Monckton sent Major Roger Morris of the 35th Regiment, in command of two men-of-war and transport ships with 325 soldiers, to deport more Acadians. On October 28, Monckton&#x27;s troops sent the women and children to Georges Island. The men were kept behind and forced to work with troops to destroy their village. On October 31, they were also sent to Halifax. In the spring of 1759, Joseph Gorham and his rangers arrived to take prisoner the remaining 151 Acadians. They reached Georges Island with them on June 29. November 1759 saw the deportation to Britain of 151 Acadians from Cape Sable who had been prisoners on George&#x27;s Island since June. In July 1759 on Cape Sable, Captain Cobb arrived and was fired upon by 100 Acadians and Miꞌkmaq.

=== Île Saint-Jean and Île Royale ===

The second wave of the expulsion began with the French defeat at the Siege of Louisbourg (1758). Thousands of Acadians were deported from Île Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) and Île Royale (Cape Breton Island). The Île Saint-Jean Campaign resulted in the largest percentage of deaths of the deported Acadians. The sinking of the ships (with about 280 persons aboard) and (with over 360 persons aboard) marked the highest numbers of fatalities during the expulsion. By the time the second wave of the expulsion had begun, the British had discarded their policy of relocating the Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies, and had begun deporting them directly to France. In 1758, hundreds of Île Royale Acadians fled to one of Boishebert&#x27;s refugee camps south of Baie des Chaleurs.

=== Petitcodiac River Campaign ===

The Petitcodiac River Campaign was a series of British military operations that occurred from June to November 1758 to deport the Acadians who either lived along the river or had taken refuge there from earlier deportations. Benoni Danks and Gorham&#x27;s Rangers carried out the operation. Contrary to Governor Lawrence&#x27;s direction, New England Ranger Danks engaged in frontier warfare against the Acadians. On July 1, 1758, Danks began to pursue the Acadians on the Petiticodiac. They arrived at present-day Moncton and Danks&#x27; Rangers ambushed about 30 Acadians who were led by Joseph Broussard &quot;dit&quot; Beausoleil. The Acadians were driven into the river where three of them were killed and scalped, and the others were captured. Broussard was seriously wounded. Danks reported that the scalps were Miꞌkmaq and received payment for them. Thereafter, he went down in local lore as &quot;one of the most reckless and brutal&quot; of the Rangers.

=== St. John River Campaign ===

Colonel Robert Monckton led a force of 1,150 British soldiers to destroy the Acadian settlements along the banks of the Saint John River until they reached the largest village of Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas (Fredericton, New Brunswick) in February 1759. Monckton was accompanied by New England Rangers led by Joseph Goreham, Captain Benoni Danks, Moses Hazen and George Scott. The British started at the bottom of the river, raiding Kennebecais and Managoueche (City of Saint John), where they built Fort Frederick. Then they moved up the river and raided Grimross (Arcadia, New Brunswick), Jemseg, and finally reached Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas.

Contrary to Governor Lawrence&#x27;s direction, New England Ranger Lieutenant Hazen engaged in frontier warfare against the Acadians in what has become known as the &quot;Ste Anne&#x27;s Massacre&quot;. On February 18, 1759, Hazen and about fifteen men arrived at Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas. The Rangers pillaged and burned the village of 147 buildings, two Catholic churches and various barns and stables. The Rangers burned a large store-house, containing a large quantity of hay, wheat, peas, oats and other foodstuffs, and killed 212 horses, about five head of cattle and a large number of hogs. They also burned the church located just west of Old Government House, Fredericton. The leader of the Acadian militia on the St. John river, Joseph Godin-Bellefontaine, refused to swear an oath despite the Rangers torturing and killing his daughter and three of his grandchildren in front of him. The Rangers also took six prisoners.

=== Gulf of St. Lawrence Campaign ===


In the Gulf of St. Lawrence Campaign, also known as the Gaspee Expedition, British forces raided French villages along present-day New Brunswick and the Gaspé Peninsula coast of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Sir Charles Hardy and Brigadier-General James Wolfe commanded the naval and military forces, respectively. After the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), Wolfe and Hardy led a force of 1500 troops in nine vessels to Gaspé Bay, arriving there on September 5. From there they dispatched troops to Miramichi Bay on September 12, Grande-Rivière, Quebec and Pabos on September 13, and Mont-Louis, Quebec on September 14. Over the following weeks, Hardy took four sloops or schooners, destroyed about 200 fishing vessels, and took about 200 prisoners.

=== Restigouche ===
The Acadians took refuge along the Baie des Chaleurs and the Restigouche River. Boishébert had a refugee camp at Petit-Rochelle, which was probably located near present-day Pointe-à-la-Croix, Quebec. The year after the Battle of Restigouche, in late 1761, Captain Roderick Mackenzie and his force captured over 330 Acadians at Boishebert&#x27;s camp.

=== Halifax ===
After the French conquered St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland on June 14, 1762, the success galvanized both the Acadians and the natives, who gathered in large numbers at various points throughout the province and behaved in a confident and, according to the British, &quot;insolent fashion&quot;. Officials were especially alarmed when natives gathered close to the two principal towns in the province, Halifax and Lunenburg, where there were also large groups of Acadians. The government organized an expulsion of 1,300 people and shipped them to Boston. The government of Massachusetts refused the Acadians permission to land and sent them back to Halifax.

Miꞌkmaw and Acadian resistance was evident in the Halifax region. On April 2, 1756, Miꞌkmaq received payment from the Governor of Quebec for twelve British scalps taken at Halifax. Acadian Pierre Gautier, son of Joseph-Nicolas Gautier, led Miꞌkmaw warriors from Louisbourg on three raids against Halifax Peninsula in 1757. In each raid, Gautier took prisoners, scalps or both. Their last raid happened in September and Gautier went with four Miꞌkmaq, and killed and scalped two British men at the foot of Citadel Hill. Pierre went on to participate in the Battle of Restigouche.

Arriving on the provincial vessel King George, four companies of Rogers Rangers (500 rangers) were at Dartmouth April 8 until May 28 awaiting the Siege of Louisbourg (1758). While there they scoured the woods to stop raids on Dartmouth.

In July 1759, Miꞌkmaq and Acadians killed five British in Dartmouth, opposite McNabb&#x27;s Island. By June 1757, the settlers had to be completely withdrawn from Lawrencetown (established 1754) because the number of Indian raids prevented settlers from leaving their houses. In nearby Dartmouth, in the spring of 1759, another Miꞌkmaw attack was launched on Fort Clarence, located at the present-day Dartmouth Refinery, in which five soldiers were killed. Before the deportation, the Acadian population was estimated at 14,000. Most were deported, but some Acadians escaped to Quebec, or hid among the Miꞌkmaq or in the countryside, to avoid deportation until the situation settled down.

=== Maine ===
In present-day Maine, the Miꞌkmaq and the Wolastoqiyik raided numerous New England villages. At the end of April 1755, they raided Gorham, killing two men and a family. Next they appeared in New Boston (Gray) and went through the neighbouring towns destroying the plantations. On May 13, they raided Frankfort (Dresden), where two men were killed and a house burned. The same day they raided Sheepscot (Newcastle) and took five prisoners. Two people were killed in North Yarmouth on May 29 and one taken captive. The natives shot one person at Teconnet, now Waterville, took prisoners at Fort Halifax and two prisoners at Fort Shirley (Dresden). They also captured two workers at the fort at New Gloucester. During this period, the Wolastoqiyik and Miꞌkmaq were the only tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy who were able to fight.

On August 13, 1758, Boishebert left Miramichi, New Brunswick with 400 soldiers, including Acadians whom he led from Port Toulouse. They marched to Fort St. George (Thomaston) and unsuccessfully laid siege to the town, and raided Munduncook (Friendship) where they wounded eight British settlers and killed others. This was Boishébert&#x27;s last Acadian expedition; from there he and the Acadians went to Quebec and fought in the Battle of Quebec (1759).

== Deportation destinations ==
In the first wave of the expulsion, most Acadian exiles were assigned to rural communities in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and South Carolina. In general, they refused to stay where they were put and large numbers migrated to the colonial port cities where they gathered in isolated, impoverished French-speaking Catholic neighbourhoods, the sort of communities Britain&#x27;s colonial officials tried to discourage. More worryingly for the British authorities, some Acadians threatened to migrate north to French-controlled regions, including the Saint John River, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island), the coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Canada. Because the British believed their policy of sending the Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies had failed, they deported the Acadians to France during the second wave of the expulsion.

=== Maryland ===
Approximately 1,000 Acadians went to the Colony of Maryland, where they lived in a section of Baltimore that became known as French Town. The Irish Catholics were reported to have shown charity to the Acadians by taking orphaned children into their homes.

=== Massachusetts ===
Approximately 2,000 Acadians disembarked at the Colony of Massachusetts. There were several families deported to the Province of Maine, a large, but sparsely populated exclave of the colony of Massachusetts. For four long winter months, William Shirley, who had ordered their deportation, had not allowed them to disembark and as a result, half died of cold and starvation aboard the ships. Some men and women were forced into servitude or forced labor, children were taken away from their parents and were distributed to various families throughout Massachusetts. The government also arranged the adoption of orphaned children and provided subsidies for housing and food for a year.

=== Connecticut ===
The Colony of Connecticut prepared for the arrival of 700 Acadians. Like Maryland, the Connecticut legislature declared that &quot;[the Acadians] be made welcome, helped and settled under the most advantageous conditions, or if they have to be sent away, measures be taken for their transfer.&quot;

=== Pennsylvania and Virginia ===
The Colony of Pennsylvania accommodated 500 Acadians. Because they arrived unexpectedly, the Acadians had to remain in port on their vessels for months. The Colony of Virginia refused to accept the Acadians on grounds that no notice was given of their arrival. They were detained at Williamsburg, where hundreds died from disease and malnutrition. They were then sent to Britain where they were held as prisoners until the Treaty of Paris in 1763.

=== Carolinas and Georgia ===
The Acadians who had offered the most resistance to the British—particularly those who had been at Chignecto—were reported to have been sent to the southernmost colonies (the Carolinas and the Colony of Georgia), where about 1,400 Acadians settled and were &quot;subsidized&quot; and put to work on plantations.

Under the leadership of Jacques Maurice Vigneau of Baie Verte, the majority of the Acadians in Georgia received a passport from the governor, John Reynolds. These passports gave the Acadians the legal right to leave Georgia and enter other colonies. South Carolina followed Georgia&#x27;s example and expediated passports to Acadian exiles in hopes they would move on to other territories. Along with these papers, South Carolina authorities provided the Acadians with two vessels. After running aground numerous times in the ships, some of these Acadians returned to the Bay of Fundy. Along the way, they were captured and imprisoned. Only 900 managed to return to Acadia, less than half of those who had begun the voyage. Others also tried to return home. The &quot;South Carolina Gazette&quot; reported that in February, about 30 Acadians fled the island to which they were confined and escaped their pursuers. Alexandre Broussard, brother of the famed resistance leader Joseph Broussard, dit Beausoleil, was among them. About a dozen are recorded to have returned to Acadia after an overland journey of 1,400 leagues ().

=== France and Britain ===

After the siege of Louisbourg, the British began to deport the Acadians directly to France rather than to the British colonies. Some Acadians deported to France never reached their destination. Almost 1,000 died when the transport ships &quot;Duke William&quot;, &quot;Violet&quot;, and sank in 1758 en route from Île Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) to France. About 3,000 Acadian refugees eventually gathered in France&#x27;s port cities and went to Nantes. 

Many Acadians who were sent to Britain were housed in crowded warehouses and subject to plagues due to the close conditions, while others were allowed to join communities and live normal lives. 
In France, 78 Acadian families were repatriated to Belle-Île-en-Mer off the western coast of Brittany after the Treaty of Paris. 
The most serious resettlement attempt was made by Louis XV, who offered of land in the Poitou province to 626 Acadian families each, where they lived close together in a region they called &quot;La Grande Ligne&quot; (&quot;The Great Road&quot;, also known as &quot;the King&#x27;s Highway&quot;). About 1,500 Acadians accepted the offer, but the land turned out to be infertile, and by the end of 1775, most of them abandoned the province.

== Fate of the Acadians ==
=== Louisiana ===
The British did not directly deport Acadians to Louisiana. Following the expulsion by the British from their home, Acadians found their way to many friendly locales, including France. Acadians left France, under the influence of Henri Peyroux de la Coudreniere, to settle in Louisiana, which was then a colony of Spain.

Louisiana was transferred to the Spanish government in 1762. Because of the good relations which existed between France and Spain, and because of their common Catholic religion, some Acadians chose to take oaths of allegiance to the Spanish government. Soon the Acadians composed the largest ethnic group in Louisiana. First, they settled in areas along the Mississippi River and later, they settled in the Atchafalaya Basin, as well as in the prairie lands to the west—a region which was later renamed Acadiana.

Some Acadians were sent to colonize places in the Caribbean, such as French Guiana, or the Falkland Islands under the direction of Louis Antoine de Bougainville; these latter efforts at colonization were unsuccessful. Other Acadians migrated to places like Saint-Domingue, but they fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. Louisiana&#x27;s population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population. (The French word &quot;Acadien&quot; evolved into the word &quot;Cadien&quot;, which was later anglicized as the word &quot;Cajun&quot;).

=== Nova Scotia ===
On July 11, 1764, the British government passed an order-in-council to permit Acadians to legally return to British territories in small isolated groups, provided that they take an unqualified oath of allegiance. Some Acadians returned to Nova Scotia (which included present-day New Brunswick). Under the deportation orders, Acadian land tenure had been forfeited to the British crown and the returning Acadians no longer owned land. Beginning in 1760 much of their former land was distributed under grant to the New England Planters. The lack of available farmland compelled many Acadians to seek out a new livelihood as fishermen on the west coast of Nova Scotia, known as the French Shore. The British authorities scattered other Acadians in groups along the shores of eastern New-Brunswick and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It was not until the 1930s, with the advent of the Acadian co-operative movements, that the Acadians became less economically disadvantaged.

== Historical comparisons ==
According to historian John Mack Faragher, the religious and ethnic dimensions of the Expulsion of Acadians are in addition to, and deeply connected with, the military exigencies cited as causes for the Removals. There is significant evidence in the correspondence of military and civil leaders for Anti-Catholicism. Faragher writes, &quot;The first session of the Nova Scotia Assembly ... passed a series of laws intended to institutionalize Acadian dispossession&quot; including an act titled &quot;An Act for the Quieting of Possessions to Protestant Grantees of land formerly occupied by the French.&quot; In it and two subsequent acts, the Church of England was made the official religion. These acts granted certain political rights to Protestants while the new laws excluded Catholics from public office and the franchise (the right to vote) and forbade Catholics from owning land in the province. It also empowered British authorities to seize all &quot;popish&quot; property (Church lands) for the crown and barred Catholic clergy from entering or residing in the province, as they wanted no repeat of Le Loutre and his type of war. In addition to other anti-Catholic measures, Faragher concludes &quot;These laws—passed by a popular assembly, not enacted by military fiat—laid the foundation for the migration of Protestant settlers.&quot;

In the 1740s, William Shirley had hoped to assimilate Acadians into the Protestant fold. He did so by trying to encourage (or force) Acadian women to marry English Protestants and statutes were passed which required the offspring of such unions to be sent to English schools and raised as &quot;English Protestants&quot; (quote from a letter by Shirley). This was linked to larger anxieties in the realm over the loyalty of Catholics in general—as Charles Stuart&#x27;s Jacobite Rebellion was a Catholic-led rebellion as was Le Loutre&#x27;s rebellion in Nova Scotia. Shirley, who in part was responsible for the Removals, according to historian Geoffrey Plank, &quot;recommended using military force to expel the most &#x27;obnoxious&#x27; Acadians and replace them with Protestant immigrants. In time the Protestants would come to dominate their new communities.&quot; Shirley wanted &quot;peaceable [loyal] subjects&quot; and specifically, in his own words, &quot;good Protestant ones.&quot;

Faragher compared the expulsion of the Acadians to contemporary acts of ethnic cleansing. In contrast, some leading historians have objected to this characterization of the expulsion. Historian John Grenier asserts that Faragher overstates the religious motivation for the expulsion and obscures the fact that the British accommodated Acadians by providing Catholic priests for forty years prior to the Expulsion. Grenier writes that Faragher &quot;overstates his case; his focus on the &quot;grand dérangement&quot; as an early example of ethnic cleansing carries too much present-day emotional weight and in turn overshadows much of the accommodation that Acadians and Anglo-Americans reached.&quot; As well, the British were clearly not concerned that the Acadians were French, given the fact that they were recruiting French &quot;foreign Protestants&quot; to settle in the region. Further, the New Englanders of Boston were not banishing Acadians from the Atlantic region; instead, they were actually deporting them to live in the heart of New England: Boston and elsewhere in the British colonies.

While there was clear animosity between Catholics and Protestants during this time period, many historians point to the overwhelming evidence which suggests that the motivation for the expulsion was military. The British wanted to cut off supply lines to the Miꞌkmaq, Louisbourg and Quebec. They also wanted to end any military threat which the Acadians posed (See Military history of the Acadians). A. J. B. Johnston wrote that the evidence for the removal of the Acadians indicates that the decision makers thought the Acadians were a military threat, therefore the deportation of 1755 does not qualify as an act of ethnic cleansing. Geoffrey Plank argues that the British continued the expulsion after 1758 for military reasons: present-day New Brunswick remained contested territory and the New Englanders wanted to make sure that British negotiators would be unlikely to return the region to the French as they had done after King George&#x27;s War.

Other historians have observed that it was not uncommon for empires to move their subjects and populations during this time period. For Naomi E. S. Griffiths and A.J.B. Johnston, the event is comparable to other deportations in history, and it should not be considered an act of ethnic cleansing. In &quot;From Migrant to Acadian&quot;, Griffiths writes that &quot;the Acadian deportation, as a government action, was a pattern with other contemporary happenings.&quot; The Expulsion of the Acadians has been compared to similar military operations during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The French carried out expulsions in Newfoundland in 1697 when they occupied the British portion of Newfoundland during Pierre d&#x27;Iberville&#x27;s Avalon Peninsula Campaign, burning every British settlement and exiling over 500 inhabitants. A.J.B. Johnston notes that in 1767, French authorities forcibly removed nearly 800 Acadian and French inhabitants from Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, transporting them against their will to France and compares the expulsions to the fate of the United Empire Loyalists, who were expelled from the United States to present-day Canada after the American Revolution. Another deportation was the Highland Clearances in Scotland between 1762 and 1886. Another North American expulsion was the Indian Removal of the 1830s, in which the Cherokee and other Native Americans from the South-East United States were removed from their traditional homelands.

Further, other historians have noted that civilian populations are often devastated during wartime. For example, five wars were fought along the New England and Acadia border during the 70 years prior to the expulsion (See French and Indian Wars, Father Rale&#x27;s War and Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War). During these wars, the French and Wabanaki Confederacy conducted numerous military campaigns in which they killed and captured British civilians. (See the Northeast Coast Campaigns 1688, 1703, 1723, 1724, 1745, 1746, 1747, 1750.)

Acadian historian Maurice Basque writes that the term genocide&#x27;... does not apply at all to the Grand Derangement. Acadie was not Armenia, and to compare Grand-Pré with Auschwitz and the killing fields of Cambodia is a complete and utter trivialization of the many genocidal horrors of contemporary history.&quot; Concerning the use of 20th century terms such as &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and &quot;genocide&quot; to understand the past, historian John G. Reid states, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s the best way to understand 18th century realities... What happened in the 18th century is a process of imperial expansion that was ruthless at times, that cost lives... But to my mind, you can&#x27;t just transfer concepts between centuries.&quot;

== Commemorations ==
In 1847, the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published a long, narrative poem about the expulsion of the Acadians titled &quot;Evangeline&quot;, in which he depicts the plight of the fictional character Evangeline. The poem became popular and made the expulsion well known. The Evangeline Oak is a tourist attraction in Louisiana. 

The song &quot;Acadian Driftwood&quot;, recorded in 1975 by The Band, portrays the Great Upheaval and the displacement of the Acadian people. 

Antonine Maillet wrote a novel, called &quot;Pélagie-la-Charrette&quot;, about the aftermath of the Great Upheaval. It was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1979. 

Grand-Pré Park is a National Historic Site of Canada situated in Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia, and preserved as a living monument to the expulsion. It contains a memorial church and a statue of Evangeline, the subject of Longfellow&#x27;s poem. 

The song &quot;Lila&quot; by The Brothers Creeggan was written to commemorate the expulsion of the Acadians, and was specifically inspired by the Evangeline statue in Grand-Pré. The song was included on their 2000 album &quot;Trunks&quot;.

The song &quot;1755&quot; was composed by American Cajun fiddler and singer Dewey Balfa and performed on his 1987 album Souvenirs, and later covered by Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys on their 1994 live album. 

According to Acadian historian Maurice Basque, the story of Evangeline continues to influence historic accounts of the deportation, emphasising neutral Acadians and de-emphasising those who resisted British America. In 2018, Canadian historian and novelist A. J. B. Johnston published a YA novel entitled &quot;The Hat&quot;, inspired by what happened at Grand-Pré in 1755.

In December 2003, Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, representing Queen Elizabeth II (Canada&#x27;s head of state), acknowledged the expulsion but did not apologize for it. She designated July 28 as &quot;A Day of Commemoration of the Great Upheaval&quot;. This proclamation, officially the Royal Proclamation of 2003, closed one of the longest cases in the history of the British courts, initiated in 1760 when the Acadian representatives first presented their grievances of forced dispossession of land, property and livestock. December 13, the date on which the &quot;Duke William&quot; sank, is commemorated as Acadian Remembrance Day. 

There is a museum dedicated to Acadian history and culture, with a detailed reconstruction of the Great Uprising, in Bonaventure, Quebec.

<doc id="397925" wikidata="Q4894620" url="?curid=397925" title="Bernwood Forest">
<text>Bernwood Forest is a forest in England. Historically it was one of several forests of the ancient Kingdom of England and was a Royal hunting forest. It is thought to have been set aside as Royal hunting land when the Anglo-Saxon kings had a palace at Brill and church in Oakley, in the 10th century and was a particularly favoured place of Edward the Confessor, who was born in nearby Islip.

From about 1217 through to the 17th century the forest went through a gradual period of deforestation. King Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) prepared a map of the forest at the time which is an invaluable tool in helping define its ancient boundaries; however, his purpose for drawing up the map was to divide the forest amongst his nobles. By the 16th century, another map of the forest had been drawn up by which time it had been reduced greatly in size. Again, the map was drawn up under the aegis of the Crown as an audit to what revenue could be made from selling off the forest. By the reign of King James I (reigned 1603–1625), the forest had lost its Royal status and had completely disappeared.

Today the name refers to the area of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire where the forest was at the time of King Henry II, covering 400 km². The approximate boundaries of the designated area today fall within the River Great Ouse, the Padbury Brook, the Claydon Brook and the River Thame.

The small modern Bernwood Forest in Buckinghamshire is approximately 1 km² and is contiguous with Hell Coppice, York&#x27;s Wood, Oakley Wood and Shabbington Wood. A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called Shabbington Woods Complex, it supports a wide variety of wildlife and is one of the most important butterfly sites in the United Kingdom. Its manager, Forestry England, originally had a more commercial approach. Aerial spraying of pesticides occurring up until the late 1960s:firstly DDT to control &quot;Hylobius abietis&quot; then 2,4,5-T to clear broad-leafed plants (including oak saplings) before planting commercial pine stands.

Holly Wood, Holton Wood, Stanton Great Wood and Waterperry Wood, all in Oxfordshire, and Ham Home-cum-Hamgreen Woods in Buckinghamshire, are also remnants of Bernwood Forest which are SSSIs. Another fragment in Buckinghamshire is Rushbeds Wood, an SSSI which is managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.

<text>The General Society of &quot;Mayflower&quot; Descendants — commonly called the Mayflower Society — is a hereditary organization of individuals who have documented their descent from at least one of the 102 passengers who arrived on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620 at what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts. The Society was founded at Plymouth in 1897.

== Organization ==
A primary goal of the Society is to educate the public about the role of the Pilgrims in the early history of what would later become the United States of America. There are Mayflower societies in all 50 United States, the District of Columbia, and Canada. 

Today, it is estimated that up to tens of millions of Americans have at least one ancestor who was among this group of early settlers. Any person able to document their descent from one or more of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrims is eligible to apply for membership in the Mayflower Society. The General Society of &quot;Mayflower&quot; Descendants is listed as an approved lineage society with the Hereditary Society Community of the United States of America.

The Society operates the home as the Mayflower House Museum, an 18th-century historic house museum with period decorations and furnishings. The offices and library of the General Society of &quot;Mayflower&quot; Descendants are located behind the mansion.

<text>William Cooper (1798–1864) was an American naturalist, conchologist (shell zoologist) and collector.

==Early life==
Cooper studied zoology in Europe from 1821 to 1824, and afterwards travelled to Nova Scotia, Kentucky and the Bahamas collecting specimens.

==Career==
Although he was not an author himself his specimens were of great help to others, such as John James Audubon, Charles Lucien Bonaparte and Thomas Nuttall. 
Cooper was one of the founders of the New York Lyceum of Natural History (later the New York Academy of Sciences), and the first American member of the Zoological Society of London. Bonaparte named the Cooper&#x27;s hawk for him, after Cooper collected a specimen of it in 1828.

==Personal life==
He was father of James Graham Cooper (1830–1902) a physician and famous naturalist in his own right.

<text>Günter Wallraff (born 1 October 1942) is a German writer and undercover journalist.

==Life==
Günther Wallraff was born in Burscheid as the son of a Ford worker and a factory owner&#x27;s daughter. After attending high school, he trained as bookseller until 1962. He began writing poetry as early as the 1950s.

Wallraff invoked his constitutional right of conscientious objection to conscription in Germany into armed military service, thus being required to carry out alternative civilian service. Having missed the deadline for filing his refusal, he was nevertheless drafted into the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;. 

Wallraff refused to use the weapon within the Bundeswehr. During his time in the Bundeswehr in 1963, he kept a diary about his service. When he announced the publication of the diary, the military leadership offered to release him if he refrained from publishing it. Wallraff rejected that. He was admitted to psychiatric ward of the Bundeswehr hospital in Koblenz (Bundeswehrzentralkrankenhaus Koblenz). In 1964 he was diagnosed by a military doctor with an &quot;abnormal personality&quot; and &quot;unfit for war and peace&quot; (&quot;untauglich für Krieg und Frieden&quot;) and was released from service. In the 1960s, the Bundeswehr was a place where many former Nazi officers served, Wallraff later said.

His experiences from this time were published in 1970 in the anthology &quot;From one who moved out and learned to fear&quot;. In this book he processed his time in the psychiatric ward of the Bundeswehr hospital in Koblenz. The involuntary role as a psychiatric patient became a key experience and starting point for his later literary work.

Wallraff described himself as a person with a weak ego. However, this weak ego also accounts for his ability to empathize with others.

From 1966 Walraff was editor of the magazine &quot;Pardon&quot;, from 1968 on for magazine &quot;konkret&quot; and from 1973 a freelance author.

Throughout his life, Wallraff repeatedly hosted persecuted prominent artists in his house for a period of time. For example, Wolf Biermann after his expatriation from the GDR or Salman Rushdie after he was given a fatwa.

==Research methods==
Wallraff came to prominence thanks to his striking journalistic research methods and several major books on lower class working conditions and tabloid journalism. This style of research is based on what the reporter experiences personally after covertly becoming part of the subgroup under investigation. Wallraff would construct a fictional identity so that he was not recognisable as a journalist.

In the German newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot; of 1977 Walraff formulates a sentence that is central to his work: &quot;“If I want to make myself the mouthpiece of the voiceless who have little to say even though they have a lot to say, that means to me that I am one of them, at least temporarily.&quot;&quot;

== Undercover journalism ==
Wallraff first took up this kind of investigative journalism in 1969 when he published &quot;13 unerwünschte Reportagen&quot; (&quot;13 undesired reports&quot;) in which he described what he experienced when acting the parts of an alcoholic, a homeless person, and a worker in a chemicals factory.

He travelled to Greece in May 1974 at the time of the Ioannides military dictatorship. While in Syntagma Square, he protested against human right violations. He was arrested and tortured by the police as he purposely did not carry on him any papers that could identify him as a foreigner. After his identity was revealed, Wallraff was convicted and sentenced to 14 months in jail. He was released in August, after the end of the dictatorship.

In 1977 Wallraff worked for four months as an editor for the tabloid &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot; newspaper in Hanover, calling himself &quot;Hans Esser&quot;. In his books &quot;Der Aufmacher&quot; (a pun meaning both &quot;Lead Story&quot; and &quot;the one who opens&quot;) and &quot;Zeugen der Anklage&quot; (&quot;Witnesses for the Prosecution&quot;) he portrays his experiences on the editorial staff of the paper and the journalism which he encountered there, which at times displayed contempt for humanity. In 1987 the journalist Hermann L. Gremliza claimed that he, rather than Wallraff, had written parts of &quot;Der Aufmacher&quot;. The book also formed the basis for the English-language film &quot;The Man Inside&quot; from 1990, starring Jürgen Prochnow as Wallraff.

&quot;Ganz unten&quot; (&quot;Lowest of the Low&quot;) (1985) documented Wallraff&#x27;s posing as a Turkish &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot;, and the mistreatment he received in that role at the hands of employers, landlords and the German government.

In 1986 he was awarded Laureate of the International Botev Prize.

In December 1996, Wallraff met with PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan at a Syrian training camp to discuss &quot;The Surahs&quot; of Kurdish dissident Selim Çürükkaya, who was threatened with death because of this book. Wallraff was warmly received by Öcalan thanks to his role as the Turkish worker &quot;Ali&quot;, but failed in getting the murder order overturned. The conversation was printed by &quot;Die Zeit&quot;.

In January 2003, Russia turned away Wallraff and two other Germans, the former labour minister for the CDU Norbert Blüm and Rupert Neudeck, head of the relief organisation Cap Anamur, as they tried to enter the country to work on a human rights article about Chechnya.

In May 2007, Wallraff announced that he had started yet another undercover journalist work, this time at a German call centre.

During 2009 he wore blackface around Germany in an undercover story to expose latent or explicit racism against black men, releasing the documentary &quot;Black on White&quot; to show his experiences. Wallraff was criticized by some for this work, such as a suggestion that Wallraff was only interested in earning money from his investigations, or that the method itself was racist.

His investigative methods have led to the creation of the Swedish verb &quot;wallraffa&quot;, meaning &quot;to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role&quot;. The word is currently (as of 2023) included in the dictionary Svenska Akademiens Ordlista.

==Responses and repercussions==

Wallraff has been heavily criticised by those on the receiving end of his style of investigation, via attempts to frame his work as breaching privacy rights or revealing trade secrets. Attempts were made on a number of occasions to legally prevent Wallraff&#x27;s investigative methods, but his actions were regularly ruled constitutional by the courts. The courts opined that freedom of the press and public interest in areas concerned with the formation of public opinion favoured Wallraff&#x27;s actions. In balancing public interest with the competing interests of those immediately affected by his actions it follows however that private conversations, for example, may not be published.

In September 2003, investigations were made by the Stasi Records Agency into the Rosenholz files on Stasi workers which somehow got into the hands of the CIA; as a result, it was claimed that Wallraff had had connections to the Stasi in the 1960s. Wallraff disputes that he ever actively worked for them. On 17 December 2004, the Hamburg district court ruled on a suit brought by Wallraff that he must not be described as an &quot;Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter&quot; or Stasi collaborator (he was being called this above all in newspapers belonging to the Axel Springer Verlag, the publishers of &quot;Bild&quot;) as no proof of collaboration could be furnished in the documents which had been presented.

Leo Laporte (; born November 29, 1956) is the former host of &quot;The Tech Guy&quot; weekly radio show and founder of TWiT.tv, an Internet podcast network focusing on technology. He is also a former TechTV technology host (1998–2008) and a technology author. On November 19, 2022, actor, writer, musician, and comedian Steve Martin called into Laporte&#x27;s radio show to announce Leo&#x27;s retirement from &quot;The Tech Guy&quot; radio show. Laporte&#x27;s last new radio show was December 18, 2022 with reruns for the remainder of the year. Rich DeMuro later appeared on the show to announce that he will be taking over in January with a weekly show, recorded on Saturdays, called &quot;Rich On Tech.&quot;

== Background ==
Laporte was born in New York City, the son of geologist Leo F. Laporte. He studied Chinese history at Yale University before dropping out in his junior year to pursue a career in radio broadcasting, where his early on-air names were Dave Allen and Dan Hayes. He began his association with computers with his first home computer, an Atari 400. By 1984 he owned a Macintosh and wrote a software review for Byte magazine.

== Television and radio ==
Laporte has worked on technology-related broadcasting projects, including &quot;Dvorak on Computers&quot; in January 1991 (co-hosted with technology writer John C. Dvorak), and &quot;Laporte on Computers&quot; on KGO Radio and KSFO in San Francisco.

In 1997, Laporte was awarded a Northern California Emmy for his role as Dev Null, a motion capture character on the MSNBC show &quot;The Site&quot;.

In 1998, Laporte created and co-hosted &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, and the original version of &quot;Call for Help&quot; on the cable and satellite network ZDTV (later &quot;TechTV&quot;).

Laporte hosted the daily television show &quot;The Lab with Leo Laporte&quot;, recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The program was formerly known as &quot;Call for Help&quot; when it was recorded in the US and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The series aired on G4 Canada, on the HOW TO Channel in Australia, on several of Canada&#x27;s Citytv affiliates, and on Google Video. On March 5, 2008, Laporte confirmed on &quot;net@nite&quot; that &quot;The Lab with Leo Laporte&quot; had been canceled by Rogers Communications. The HOW TO Channel did not air the remaining episodes after it was announced the show had been canceled.

He hosted, until December 2022, a weekend technology-oriented talk radio program show titled &quot;Leo Laporte: The Tech Guy&quot;. The show, started on KFI AM 640 (Los Angeles), was syndicated through Premiere Radio Networks. Laporte appeared on Friday mornings on KFI with Bill Handel, and previously on such shows as &quot;Showbiz Tonight&quot;, &quot;Live with Kelly&quot;, and &quot;World News Now&quot;.

He holds an amateur radio license, W6TWT.

==Bibliography==
Laporte has written technology-oriented books including:

He has published a yearly series of technology almanacs:

*&quot;Leo Laporte&#x27;s Technology Almanac&quot;
*&quot;Poor Leo&#x27;s Computer Almanac&quot; 
*&quot;Leo Laporte&#x27;s 2006 Technology Almanac&quot; 

Laporte announced in October 2006 that he would not renew his contract with Que Publishing, and had retired from publishing books.

In 2008, Laporte did a voice narration of Andrew Lang&#x27;s fable &quot;The True History of Little Golden-hood&quot; from Audible (Amazon), a sponsor.

== Podcasting ==
Laporte owns and operates a podcast network, TWiT.tv with his wife Lisa Laporte. Before the expansion to new facilities in 2011, Laporte said TWiT earned million (equivalent to $ in ) annually on a production cost of (equivalent to $ in ). In a 2012 Reddit posting, he commented that revenue was approaching million (equivalent to $ in ). The TWiT studios are located in Petaluma, California, where Laporte lives.

<doc id="397943" wikidata="Q1218654" url="?curid=397943" title="Camera Lucida (book)">
<text>Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography (, ) is a short book published in 1980 by the French literary theorist and philosopher Roland Barthes. It is simultaneously an inquiry into the nature and essence of photography and a eulogy to Barthes&#x27; late mother. The book investigates the effects of photography on the spectator (as distinct from the photographer, and also from the object photographed, which Barthes calls the &quot;spectrum&quot;).

In a deeply personal discussion of the lasting emotional effect of certain photographs, Barthes considers photography as asymbolic, irreducible to the codes of language or culture, acting on the body as much as on the mind. The book develops the twin concepts of &quot;studium&quot; and &quot;punctum&quot;: &quot;studium&quot; denoting the cultural, linguistic, and political interpretation of a photograph, &quot;punctum&quot; denoting the wounding, personally touching detail which establishes a direct relationship with the object or person within it.

&quot;Camera Lucida&quot;, which takes its name from the optical device the &quot;camera lucida&quot;, consists of 48 chapters divided into two parts. The book is composed in free form and does not follow a particularly rigid structure. Barthes does not present a fixed thesis, but instead, highlights the evolution of his thought process as the book unfolds. As such, he consistently returns to ideas expressed in previous chapters to complete them, or even deny them. The story becomes increasingly personal in the second half, as scientific terminology, precise vocabulary, and numerous scholarly and cultural references give way to increasingly subjective and intimate language. The book is illustrated by 25 photographs, old and contemporary, chosen by the author. Among them are the works of famous photographers such as William Klein, Robert Mapplethorpe and Nadar, in addition to a photograph from Barthes&#x27; private collection.

==Context==
&quot;Camera Lucida&quot;, along with Susan Sontag&#x27;s &quot;On Photography&quot;, was one of the most important early academic books of criticism and theorization on photography. Neither writer was a photographer, however, and both works have been much criticised since the 1990s. Nevertheless, it was by no means Barthes&#x27;s earliest approach to the subject. Barthes mentions photography in one of his &#x27;little mythologies&#x27;—articles published in the journal &quot;Les Lettres Nouvelles&quot; starting in 1954, and gathered in &quot;Mythologies&quot;, published in 1957 (and in English translation in 1972). The article &quot;Photography and Electoral Appeal&quot; is more obviously political than &quot;Camera Lucida&quot;.

In the 1960s and entering the next decade, Barthes&#x27;s analysis of photography develops more detail and insight through a structuralist approach; the treatment of photography in &quot;Mythologies&quot; is by comparison tangential and simple. There is still in this structural phase a strong political impulse and background to his theorizing of photography; Barthes connects photography&#x27;s ability to represent without style (a &#x27;perfect analogon&#x27;: &quot;The Photographic Message&quot;, 1961) to its tendency to naturalise what are in fact invented and highly structured meanings. His examples deal with press photographs and advertising, which make good use of this property (or bad use of it, as the case may be).

Published two months prior to his death in 1980, &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; is Barthes&#x27;s first and only book devoted to photography. By now his tactics in writing, always shifting and complex, favouring the dialectical to the morally or politically &#x27;committed&#x27; (Sartre), had once again changed. If sentimentality can be seen as a tactic in the late career of Roland Barthes, then &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; belongs to such an approach. It is novelistic, in line with the developments towards this new type of writing which Barthes had shown with &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Discourse&quot; and &quot;Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes&quot;. However, the ideas about photography in &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; are certainly prepared in essays like &quot;The Photographic Message&quot;, &quot;Rhetoric of the Image&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Third Meaning&quot; (1971). There is a movement through these three pieces of which &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; can be seen as the culmination. With &quot;The Third Meaning&quot; there is the suggestion that the photograph&#x27;s reality, aside from all the messages it can be loaded with, might constitute an avant-garde value: not a message as such, aimed at the viewer/reader, but another kind of meaning that arises almost accidentally yet without being simply &#x27;the material&#x27; or &#x27;the accidental&#x27;; this is the eponymous third meaning. This essay of 1970, ostensibly about some Eisenstein stills, anticipates many of &quot;Camera Lucida&quot;&#x27;s ideas and connects them back to still earlier ones. One could almost swap the term &quot;third meaning&quot; for the &quot;punctum&quot; of &quot;Camera Lucida&quot;.
Yet the personal note of pain in &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; is not present in these earlier writings and is unmistakable. Written after his mother&#x27;s death, &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; is as much a reflection on death as it is on photography. Barthes died after being struck by a laundry van soon after the publication of &quot;Camera Lucida&quot;, and many have read the book as Barthes&#x27; eulogy for himself.

The production started in 1959–1960. Models 1001, 1002, 1003, 1013, 1103, 1204 were of original Polish construction. Models 1304 and 1305 were functional counterparts of ICL 1905 and 1906 due to software agreement. The last model was 1325 based on two models by ICL.

The computers were built at the Elwro manufacturing plant, which was closed in 1993. 

Odra 1002 was capable of only 100–400 operations per second.

In 1962, Witold Podgórski, an employee of Elwro, created computer game Marienbad on a prototype of Odra 1003; it was an adaptation of a variant of Nim, as depicted in the film &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;. The computer could play a perfect game and was guaranteed to win. The game was never distributed outside of the Elwro company, but its versions appeared elsewhere. It was probably the first Polish computer game in history.

The operating system used by the Odra 1204 is called SODA. It was designed to work on a small computer without magnetic storage and
can run simultaneous loading and execution of programs.

An Odra 1204 computer was used by a team in Leningrad developing an ALGOL 68 compiler in 1976. The Odra 1204 ran the syntax analysis, code generation ran on an IBM System/360.

Up until 30 April 2010 there was still one Odra 1305 working at the railway station in Wrocław Brochów. The system was shut down at 22:00 CEST and replaced with a contemporary computer system.

The Museum of the History of Computers and Information Technology (&quot;Muzeum Historii Komputerów i Informatyki&quot;) in Katowice, Poland started a project to recommission an Odra 1305 in 2017.

<text>Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot, (168514 February 1737) was a British lawyer and politician. He was Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1733 to 1737.

==Early life==
Talbot was the eldest son of Rt. Rev. William Talbot, Bishop of Durham, a descendant of the 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Catherine King. 

He was educated at Eton and Oriel College, Oxford, and became a fellow of All Souls College in 1704. 

==Career==
He was called to the bar in 1711, and in 1717 was appointed solicitor general to the prince of Wales. Having been elected a member of the House of Commons in 1720, he became Solicitor General in 1726, and in 1733 he was made Lord Chancellor and raised to the peerage with the title of Lord Talbot, Baron of Hensol, in the County of Glamorgan.

Talbot proved himself a capable equity judge during the three years of his occupancy of the Woolsack. Among his contemporaries he enjoyed the reputation of a wit; he was a patron of the poet James Thomson, who in &quot;The Seasons&quot; commemorated a son of his to whom he acted as tutor; Joseph Butler dedicated his famous &quot;Analogy&quot; to Talbot, as was Upton&#x27;s edition of Epictetus. The title he assumed derived from the Hensol estate in Pendoylan, Glamorgan, which came to him through his wife.

Talbot is remembered as one of the authors of the Yorke–Talbot slavery opinion, as a crown law officer in 1729. The opinion was sought to determinate the legality of slavery: Talbot and Philip Yorke opined that it was legal. The opinion was relied upon widely before the decision of Lord Mansfield in Somersett&#x27;s Case.

==Personal life==

Talbot married, in the summer of 1708, Cecil Mathew (d. 1720), daughter of Charles Mathew of Castell y Mynach, Glamorganshire, and granddaughter and heiress of David Jenkins of Hensol. There he built a mansion in the Tudor style, known as the Castle. They had five sons, of whom three survived him:

* William Talbot, 1st Earl Talbot (1710–1782), who married Mary de Cardonnel, daughter of Rt. Hon. Adam de Cardonnel, in .
* Hon. John Talbot (d. 1756), who married Henrietta Maria Decker, daughter of Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet, in 1737. After her death, he married Hon. Catherine Chetwynd, daughter of John Chetwynd, 2nd Viscount Chetwynd, in 1748.
* Rev. Hon. George Talbot (d. 1782), who married Hon. Anne Bouverie, daughter of Jacob Bouverie, 1st Viscount Folkestone. They had four children, but only their sons lived to adulthood one of which was the Ver. Rev. Charles Talbot.

After an illness during which the King and Queen enquired after his health every day, Talbot died on 14February 1737 at his home in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. He was succeeded in the title by his second son, William (1710–1782).

<doc id="397947" wikidata="Q849863" url="?curid=397947" title="Forged from the Love of Liberty">
<text>&quot;Forged from the Love of Liberty&quot; is the national anthem of the Trinidad and Tobago. Originally composed as the national anthem for the short-lived West Indies Federation (1958–1962), this song was edited and adopted by Trinidad and Tobago when it became independent in 1962. It was written and composed by Patrick Castagne.

== History ==
Patrick Castagne, a renowned West Indian songwriter, was employed at the Trinidad and Tobago Commission in London. One of his compositions, called &quot;A Song for the Islands&quot; or &quot;A Song for Federation&quot;, was submitted to the West Indies Federation as a possible anthem. Castagne&#x27;s &quot;A Song for Federation&quot; provided the musical inspiration that could have matched the foundation of a strong federation had it survived. The close resemblance between the national anthem of Trinidad and Tobago and &quot;A Song for Federation&quot; can be seen from the lyrics of the latter, as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;Forged from the love of unity
In the fires of hope and prayer
With boundless faith in our destiny
West Indians all declare:

Side by side we stand
With our hearts joined across the sea
This our native land
We pledge ourselves for thee.

𝄆 Here every creed and race find an equal place,
And may God bless our nation. 𝄇&lt;/poem&gt;

When the Federation collapsed, he changed some of the lines and resubmitted the song to Trinidad and Tobago for the competition to choose its national anthem. In total, the competition received 834 word-only entries, 33 music-only entries and 306 entries with both words and music. Castagne&#x27;s submission came out on top, and he won the prize of $5,000.00 in government bonds and a gold medal inscribed with the coat of arms of Trinidad and Tobago.

Castagne&#x27;s alteration of &quot;A Song for Federation&quot; was deemed to be most suitable for a twin-island state that consisted of &quot;islands of the blue Caribbean Sea&quot; standing &quot;side by side&quot; in promoting the values of &quot;every creed and race&quot; finding &quot;an equal place&quot; in the multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural society of Trinidad and Tobago as it existed in 1962. It was considered to have reflected the nature and the strength of the people of Trinidad and Tobago and their courage as one nation working towards living in unity despite the existing diversity. According to the editorial in the &quot;Sunday Guardian&quot; of 19 August 1962:

<text>The history of computing hardware in the Eastern Bloc is somewhat different from that of the Western world. As a result of the CoCom embargo, computers could not be imported on a large scale from Western Bloc.

Eastern Bloc manufacturers created copies of Western designs based on intelligence gathering and reverse engineering. This redevelopment led to some incompatibilities with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and IEEE standards, such as spacing integrated circuit pins at of a 25 mm length (colloquially a &quot;metric inch&quot;) instead of a standard inch of 25.4 mm. This made Soviet chips unsellable on the world market outside the Comecon, and made test machinery more expensive.

==History==

By the end of the 1950s most COMECON countries had developed experimental computer designs, yet none of them had managed to create a stable computer industry.

In October 1962 the &quot;Commission for Scientific Problems in Computing&quot; (Комиссия Научные Вопросы Вычислительной Техники, КНВВТ) was founded in Warsaw and modelled after the International Federation for Information Processing.

Computer design and production began to be coordinated between the Comecon countries in 1964, when the Edinaya Sistema mainframe (Unified System, ES, also known as RIAD) was introduced. The project also included plans for the development of a joint Comecon computer network.

Each COMECON country was given a role in the development of the ES: Hungary was responsible for software development, while East Germany improved the design of disk storage devices. The ES-1040 was successfully exported to countries outside the Comecon, including India, Yugoslavia and China. Each country specialized in a model of the ES series: R-10 in the case of Hungary, R-20 in Bulgaria, R-20A in Czechoslovakia, R-30 in Poland and R-40 in East Germany.

Nairi-3, developed at the Armenian Institute for Computers, was the first third-generation computer in the Comecon area, using integrated circuits. Development on the Nairi system began in 1964, and it went into serial production in 1969.

In 1969 the Intergovernmental Commission for Computer Technology was founded to coordinate computer production. Other cooperation initiatives included the establishment of joint Comecon development facilities in Moscow and Kiev. The R-300 computer, released in 1969, demonstrated the technical and managerial skills of VEB Robotron, and established a leading role for East Germany in the joint development efforts. The relative success of Robotron was attributed to its greater organizational freedom, and the profit motive of securing export orders.
In 1970, Cuba produced its first digital computer, the CID-201.

By 1972 the Comecon countries had produced around 7,500 computers, compared to 120,000 in the rest of the world. The USSR, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania had all set up computer production and research institutes. Collaboration between Romania and the other countries was limited, due to the autarkic policies of Nicolae Ceaușescu.

The availability of western computing hardware differed considerably between communist countries; in the early 1970s they were most common in Czechoslovakia, where a licensing agreement was signed with the French Groupe Bull. Non-Soviet Eastern European countries had more access to Western technology, which allowed them to manufacture more sophisticated computer equipment.

In 1983 the representatives of the national academies of sciences of the Comecon countries met in Sofia to discuss the development of a new generation of computer systems. In June 1985 the “Conception of a new generation of computer systems” was approved in Prague, with the objective of creating a socialist response to the Japanese fifth generation computer initiative. The document planned the development of the IT industry in socialist countries up to the year 2010.

In 1985 Ukrainian researchers managed to reverse-engineer the ZX Spectrum chip and built a hardware clone using readily available parts. Over 50 different versions of the Spectrum were created in Eastern Bloc countries over the next few years, including the Hobbit, Baltica, Pentagon, Scorpion, Leningrad, Didaktik (Czechoslovakia), Spectral (East Germany) and Cobra (Romania).
In 1985 the computer industry of Bulgaria exported computer hardware to over 20 countries, manufacturing personal computers, word processing terminals and memory tapes and disks. At its peak, the country provided 40% of computers in the Comecon area.

After the collapse of Comecon in 1989, the computer hardware sector in its former member countries could not compete with foreign manufacturers, and virtually disappeared. Tens of thousands of IT scientists and engineers migrated to Western Europe for employment, not always in fields related to their expertise.

==Unified System project==
ES EVM (ЕС ЭВМ, Единая система электронных вычислительных машин, meaning &quot;Unified System of Electronic Computers&quot;) was a series of clones of IBM&#x27;s System/360 and System/370 mainframes. The objective of the project, which was also known as Ryad (&#x27;series&#x27;), was to create a general purpose computer for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Initially announced as a Soviet venture in 1967, in 1969 it became an international project, involving Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary and Poland. Romania and Cuba joined the project in 1973.

The first models entered serial production in 1972. According to CIA sources, by 1975 the Comecon countries had managed to build only 10% to 15% of the anticipated number of ES computers. Production continued until 1995. The total number of ES EVM mainframes produced was more than 15,000.

In the period from 1986 to 1997, a series of PC-compatible desktop computers, called ПЭВМ ЕС ЭВМ (Personal Computers of ES EVM series), was also produced; the newer versions of these computers are still produced under a different name on a very limited scale in Minsk.

== Small Machines System project ==

SM EVM (СМ ЭВМ, Система Малых ЭВМ, meaning &quot;System of Small Electronic Computers&quot;) was an intergovernmental program for creating minicomputers, run by the Ministry of Instrument Making. The program initially included two major architectural lines based on DEC PDP-11 architecture and HP 2100 architecture. Later the program included a family of DEC VAX compatible computers and Multibus based microcomputers. Minicomputers developed within the framework of the program were intended for use as computer based control systems, measuring and computing systems and workstations for CAD systems. As in the case of ES EVM, the program began as a Soviet venture and in 1974 became an international project involving Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

== TPA ==
TPA (Tárolt Programú Analizátor, meaning &quot;Stored-Program Analyser&quot;) was a Hungarian product line of computers. It could not be referred as a computer, though, as computers were meant to be produced by the Soviet Union. The project started based on the freely available manuals of DEC PDP-8 in 1966 and products made available in 1968. TPAs were 100% software compatible with their original counterparts. The project remained highly popular for about 25 years. PDP-11 compatible TPAs appeared in 1976, VAX-11 compatibles in 1983.

Due to CoCom restrictions 32 bit computers could not be exported to the Eastern Bloc. In practice 32-bit DEC computers and processors were available. Those were rebranded as TPA.

<text>Henry Koster (born Hermann Kosterlitz, May 1, 1905 – September 21, 1988) was a German-born film director. He was the husband of actress Peggy Moran.

==Early life==
Koster was born to Jewish parents in Berlin, Germany. He was introduced to cinema around the year 1910 when his uncle opened a movie theater in Berlin. Koster&#x27;s mother played the piano to accompany the films, leaving the young boy to occupy himself by watching the films. After working initially as a short story writer, Kosterlitz was hired by a Berlin movie company as scenarist, becoming an assistant to director Curtis Bernhardt. Bernhardt became sick one day and asked Kosterlitz to take over as director.

==Career==
In 1932, Koster directed his first film in Berlin, the comedy &quot;Thea Roland&quot;. Koster was in the midst of directing his second film &quot;Das häßliche Mädchen&quot;, when Hitler and the Nazi party rose to power. He automatically lost his German citizenship (as did all German Jews) in 1933, when Hitler became chancellor, and managed to complete his second film before being forbidden to make films under the intense, legalized antisemitism, (i.e. persecution of Jews) which accompanied Garmany&#x27;s embrace of Hitler and Nazism. He lost his temper at an SA officer at his bank during lunch hour and knocked the officer out. When the film, written by Koster with Felix Joachimson, had its premiere in autumn 1933 their names were deleted and Koster, along with Joachimson and the many hundreds of other German Jewish filmmakers, writers and musicians, now stateless and unemployable, was forced into exile.

Koster left Germany for France, where he was rehired by Bernhardt (who had left earlier). Eventually Koster went to Budapest and met and married Kató Király in 1934. In Budapest he met Joe Pasternak again, who represented Universal in Europe, and directed three films for him. One of those films was &quot;Catherine the Last&quot; after a script by Joachimson and Károly Nóti that was remade in 1938 by Norman Taurog as &quot;The Girl Downstairs&quot;, both versions starring Franciska Gaal. In 1935 Koster received a letter from his friend Gabriel Levy, who asked him to direct a Dutch picture. Unwilling to move to the Netherlands, Koster cabled him &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m terribly busy. Besides, I&#x27;m now charging a salary which is too much for your small production. If you want to know what my salary is, I make 25.000 dollars for a picture.&quot; To his great surprise, Levy cabled him back agreeing to pay him said amount. Thus Koster ended up directing &quot;De Kribbebijter&quot;, released internationally as &quot;The Crosspatch&quot;.

In 1936 Koster got a contract to work with Universal Pictures in Hollywood, and he traveled to the United States to work with Pasternak, other refugees and his wife. Although Koster did not speak English, he convinced the studio to let him make &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot;, for which he personally coached 14-year-old star Deanna Durbin. This picture, a big success, pulled Universal out of bankruptcy. Koster&#x27;s second Universal film, &quot;One Hundred Men and a Girl&quot;, with Durbin and Leopold Stokowski also was successful. 

Koster discovered Abbott and Costello working at a nightclub in New York. He returned to Hollywood and convinced Universal to hire them. Their first picture, which featured the &quot;Who&#x27;s On First?&quot; routine, was &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot;. The female lead, Peggy Moran, became Koster&#x27;s second wife in 1942. When he married Moran, Koster promised her he would put her in every movie he made. He did, but it was her statue. Usually it is a sculptured head on a mantelpiece or a piano or desk. For &quot;The Robe&quot;, he commissioned a Grecian bust which appears prominently in a Roman villa.

Henry Koster went on to do numerous musicals and family comedies during the late 1930s and early 1940s, with Durbin, Betty Grable, and other musical stars of the era. He and Joe Pasternak filmed a successful screen test for Universal&#x27;s newest singing star, Gloria Jean, but Koster would never direct one of her features; when Pasternak left Universal for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in June 1941, Koster went with him. Ironically, despite Koster&#x27;s escape from Nazi Germany, when the United States entered World War II Koster was considered an enemy alien and had to stay in his house in the evening. Actor Charles Laughton would visit Koster and play chess with him.
Koster&#x27;s postwar career was equally successful. He was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1947). In 1950, he directed the James Stewart comedy &quot;Harvey&quot;. He directed Richard Burton&#x27;s first U.S. film, &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot;, and then in 1953, he was given &quot;The Robe&quot;, the first CinemaScope film, and Koster&#x27;s biggest box office hit. He directed more costume dramas, including &quot;Désirée&quot; (1954) with Marlon Brando, &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (1955) with Bette Davis, &quot;The Naked Maja&quot; (1958) with Ava Gardner and &quot;The Story of Ruth&quot; (1960) with Elana Eden, then returned to family comedies and musicals, including &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; for Universal in 1961. His last picture was &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; in 1965. Koster retired to Leisure Village in Camarillo, California, where he painted a series of portraits of the movie stars with whom he worked.

Although Koster never won an Oscar, he directed six different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Cecil Kellaway, Loretta Young, Celeste Holm, Elsa Lanchester, Josephine Hull, James Stewart and Richard Burton. Hull won the Oscar for &quot;Harvey&quot;.

He died of liver cancer.

Some of Koster&#x27;s home movies are part of the collection of the Academy Film Archive. The archive has preserved a number of these home movies, including behind-the-scenes footage from some of Koster&#x27;s films.

<doc id="397970" wikidata="Q579440" url="?curid=397970" title="Wye (rail)">
<text>In railroad structures and rail terminology, a wye (like the&quot; &#x27;Y&#x27; &quot;glyph) or triangular junction (often shortened to just triangle) is a triangular joining arrangement of three rail lines with a railroad switch (set of points) at each corner connecting to the incoming lines. A turning wye is a specific case.
Where two rail lines join, or where a spur diverges from a railroad&#x27;s mainline, wyes can be used at a mainline rail junction to allow incoming trains to travel in either direction.

Wyes can also be used for turning railway equipment, and generally cover less area than a balloon loop doing the same job, but at the cost of two additional sets of points to construct and then maintain. These turnings are accomplished by performing the railway equivalent of a three-point turn through successive junctions of the wye. The direction of travel and the relative orientation of a locomotive or railway vehicle thus can be reversed. Where a wye is built specifically for equipment reversing purposes, one or more of the tracks making up the junction will typically be a stub siding.

Tram or streetcar tracks also make use of triangular junctions and sometimes have a short triangle or wye stubs to turn the car at the end of the line.

== Considerations ==
=== At junctions ===
The use of triangular junctions allows flexibility in routing trains from any line to either of the two other paths, without the need to reverse the train. For this reason they are common across most rail networks. A slower train may be signaled to temporarily enter a wye (as a refuge siding in lieu of a passing loop) for a meet with an oncoming train, or to allow a faster one to overtake, and then reverse out to continue in the original direction.

Where one or more of the lines forming the junction are multi-track, the presence of a triangular junction does introduce a number of potential conflicting moves. For this reason, where traffic is heavy the triangle may incorporate flying junctions on some of the legs.

=== For turning equipment ===
From time to time it is necessary to turn both individual pieces of railroad equipment or whole trains. This may be because the piece of equipment is not directionally symmetrical, for example, most steam locomotives and some diesel locomotives, or where the consist has a dedicated tail end car such as an observation car. Even where equipment is symmetrical, periodic turning may still be necessary in order to equalize wear (e.g., on the London Underground&#x27;s Circle Line). 

Several different techniques can be used to achieve such turning. Turntables require the least space, but can generally only deal with a single piece of equipment at a time. Balloon or turning loops can turn trains of any length — up to the total length of the loop — in a single operation, but require far more space than wyes. Rail wyes can be constructed on sites where a loop would not be possible, and can turn trains up to the length of the stub tracks at the end of the wye.

Railroad systems in North America and Australia have tended to have more wyes than railroads elsewhere. North American locomotives and cars (such as observation cars) are more likely to be directional than those found on other continents. In Canada and the United States, the railroad often was built before other structures, and railway builders had much more freedom to lay down tracks where they wished. Similarly, when not constrained by space limitations many early Australian railways made use of wyes (particularly in rural locations) for their lower installation and maintenance costs; however, their necessity and use diminished from the 1960s onwards with the major trend in most states toward bidirectional locomotives and railcars.

In Europe, although some use was made of bi-directional tank locomotives and push–pull trains, most steam locomotives were uni-directional. Because of land usage considerations, turntables were normally used to turn such locomotives, and most terminal stations and locomotive depots were so equipped. Over time, most diesel and electric locomotives ordered in Europe have been designed to be fully bi-directional and normally with two driving cabs. Thus most rail wyes, where they existed, and turntables have been taken out of use.

=== Streetcar or tram systems ===
Similar considerations as for mainline rail systems apply to the use of triangular junctions and reversing wyes on streetcar and tram systems. Many, although by no means all, streetcar and tram systems use single ended vehicles that have doors on one side only, and that must be turned at each end of the route.

However, the vehicles used on such systems tend to have much smaller minimum curvature requirements than heavy rail equipment. This renders the use of a balloon loop more practical in a small amount of space, and with street-running vehicles such a loop may be able to use side streets or street squares. However, although turning loops are the most common way of turning such vehicles, wye tracks are also sometimes used.

=== Disadvantages ===
A triangle may have a situational disadvantage in train operations when space constraints of the local geography cause one leg of triangle to bypass a main station. In tight city environments, this can happen easily, as it did, for example, at Cootamundra West, Australia and Tecuci, Romania, where extra passenger stations had to be built to serve trains taking the shortcut.

In contrast, the engineering of a terminus station such as Woodville Railway Station, New Zealand avoided this problem by building a balloon loop (reversing loop) so that trains can serve the main station in either direction without the need to reverse. In a midline station where it is desired to reverse a consist or locomotive, a double-track and turning wye arrangement is far more common.

=== Land usage ===

The land within a triangle is cut off from the adjacent area (and normally fenced off) and has marginal commercial value, so will be purposed mainly for the railway&#x27;s exclusive use – generally being used for maintenance depots, storage, or vehicle parking. On electrified lines substations tend to be located inside triangles, in part because the land is cheap, and also because it provides the most convenient and flexible sectioning arrangements.

== Earliest examples ==
The earliest British (and possibly worldwide) example is the double-tracked triangle within Earlestown railway station on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was completed by the Grand Junction Railway in 1837. The triangle has two passenger platform faces on each of its three sides and five of the six platforms are in frequent (half-hourly, etc.) use by passenger trains. When steam engines were in regular use the triangle (which is of course also traversed by freight trains) was also used to turn locomotives, and can still be so used.

An earlier example may be on the Cromford and High Peak Railway, which had been opened in 1831 as a horse-drawn railway. This appears to have been used for reversing trains of wagons with end doors that have just come up the rope-hauled inclines to the highest level of the railway before they proceeded down the remaining inclines. The site of this can still be seen near Hindlow, in Derbyshire. (National Grid location .).

== Examples by country ==
=== Australia ===

Sefton railway station in Sydney lies on one corner of a triangular junction, which allows trains to branch off in either direction without the need to terminate or change ends. One train a day from Birrong to Sefton does terminate and reverse at Regents Park station (in order to clean the rust off the crossover rails). There is a goods branch from Chullora and, in the future, the possibility of a separate single track freight line. The three passenger stations at the vertices of the triangle have island platforms making it convenient to change trains. The sharp curves of the triangle, and especially the turnouts on those sharp curves, restrict train speeds to between .
Near Hamilton station on the Central Coast and Newcastle line there is a wye for freight trains and regional trains. This puts them directly on the Main Northern line.

A number of triangular junctions were built on the Victorian Railways network, both at major junctions, and for turning locomotives and train consists in places where the provision of a turntable was impractical or unnecessarily expensive. These included:
* Wodonga – Built on the junction of the Cudgewa Line and used to turn the consists of the &quot;Sydney Limited&quot; and &quot;Spirit of Progress&quot; trains.
* Ararat
* North Geelong – built to allow trains to travel directly between Geelong, Ballarat or Melbourne without using a run-around or turntable. It was also used to turn trains, such as during the demonstration run of the Spirit of Progress in 1937.

A triangular junction is used to turn tramcars on the Portland Cable Tram line in Portland, Victoria.

=== Ireland ===
In the Republic of Ireland two triangular junctions are in use. One is at Limerick Junction, and the other at Lavistown, near Kilkenny. The former allows direct Limerick–Dublin passenger trains to bypass the Limerick Junction station, and is also occasionally used to turn steam locomotives on railtours, whilst the latter is used primarily by freight trains running between the Port of Waterford and County Mayo to avoid having to run around in Kilkenny station.

In Belfast, Northern Ireland, a triangular junction exists at Grand Central station. It is rarely used to turn locomotives, save the occasional steam engine. It is only used for out of service trains. Commuter trains enter the junction from one direction (e.g., the Portadown line), stop at Grand Central, and then continue out on the other direction towards Bangor station. Commuter trains on NI Railways are all diesel multiple unit railcars, so they do not need to use the junction as a turning method.

The only other operational triangular junction in Ireland is Downpatrick Loop on the Downpatrick and County Down Railway. Originally constructed to allow direct Belfast–Newcastle trains to bypass Downpatrick station, the triangle forms the basis of a heritage railway, the only heritage railway of this type in the British Isles. There is one station at each end of the triangle and another in the southernmost corner.

Historical triangular junctions in Ireland include Moyasta Junction on the West Clare line, the Monkstown/Greenisland/Bleach Green triangle on the Northern Counties Committee and Bundoran Junction on the Great Northern Railway. Though two sides of the former are still in mainline use, the &quot;back line&quot; between Monkstown and Greenisland has been removed, whilst the latter was closed altogether in 1957. Additionally, the Great Northern&#x27;s largest locomotive yard at Adelaide never had a turntable, using a dedicated turning triangle instead.

The Luas tram system has a triangular junction on the Red Line between the stations of Busáras, Connolly and George&#x27;s Dock. The line that goes between George&#x27;s Dock and Connolly is never used, as no trams operate between The Point and Connolly.

=== Italy ===
Railways in Italy used a number of for turning locomotives. This uses a pentagram layout, requiring four movements and five turnouts to reverse. It allows a smaller layout, without excessively tight curve radii, compared to a triangle.

Some of these still survive, such as at of Carbonia in Sardinia and at Mals or Malles Venosta in Val Venosta in the South Tyrol.

In addition to small terminal stations such as Carbonia and Malles Venosta, inversion stars were also installed at some principal stations such as Verona Porta Nuova and Brenner at the summit of the Brenner Pass.

=== Namibia ===
Tsumeb railway station in Namibia has two triangles. The first and smaller one is for turning engines and is near the station. The second and larger one is to bypass the dead-end station at Tsumeb for trains travelling directly between the new extension towards Angola and Windhoek. This direct bypass line can save an hour of shunting time, particularly if the train is longer than the loops in the station.

=== Switzerland ===
There is a turning triangle partly tunnelled into the mountain at Kleine Scheidegg at the summit of the 800mm gauge Wengernalpbahn in the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland. Kleine Scheidegg is reached from two lower termini, Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, located on opposite sides of the col. Trains normally descend in the direction they have arrived from and are designed accordingly with the power unit at the lower end and seating angled to compensate for the gradient. They therefore have to be turned at the summit should it be necessary to make a through journey. Whilst limitations of space dictated that the triangle had to be partly constructed in tunnels it also ensures that in winter it is snow-free and thus readily available in emergencies.

===United Kingdom===

In Britain triangular layouts that could be used for turning locomotives were usually the result of junctions of two or more lines. There are many examples, including the one known as the Maindee triangle in Newport, South Wales. Here the ex-GWR South Wales mainline from London to Swansea is joined by another GWR line from Shrewsbury via Hereford. The significance of it is that steam-hauled trains can run to Newport and their engines be turned using the triangle. Its National Grid location is . Shrewsbury also has a triangular route formation that was used to turn steam locomotives, and is still available. A triangle, , was provided in 1989 adjacent to the transfer sidings for Wylfa Nuclear Power Station, near to Valley on Anglesey in Wales. This enables the North Wales Coast Line to be used by steam hauled excursions. The turntable at Holyhead has long been removed and the area re-developed; the sidings at Valley some 4 miles (6.4 km) from the terminus are the nearest suitable site.

An unusual arrangement, unique in Britain, was constructed at Grantham. Its location was and it is shown on the 1963 edition of OS 1 inch to 1 mile sheet 113. It was built in the 1950s after the turntable at the locomotive shed failed and expenditure on a replacement was no longer justified. Locomotives requiring to be turned had to travel to Barkston Junction to traverse the triangular layout there (this was where &quot;Mallard&quot; with a dynamometer car attached was turned before starting out south on its record-breaking run on 3 July 1938). The journey to Barkston Junction and back was a time-consuming business involving a round trip of some along the busy East Coast Main Line. Eventually authority was given to construct a turning arrangement on a strip of spare land to the west of the main line, just south of Grantham station. There was insufficient space for a conventional triangle but this was overcome by constructing an &quot;inside-out&quot; triangle whereby the approach tracks intersected in a scissors crossing.

=== United States ===
Many North American passenger terminals in large cities had wye tracks to allow the turning and backing of directional passenger trains onto a main line. Freight traffic could bypass the terminal through the wye. Notable examples include the Los Angeles Union Station, which has a double wye, the Saint Paul Union Depot, and the Memphis Union Station.

A typical use for a stub-end passenger station would be as follows: A wye was incorporated at the &quot;throat&quot; where the rows of tracks converged from the station to facilitate the turning of trains. An arriving train came to a stop on the main line after passing the wye. Once the switches on the wye are aligned, the train reversed, with the brakeman at the rear of the last car regulating the speed with the brake lever upon approach to the platform. After coming to a complete stop at the end of the track, passengers were allowed to disembark safely.

Meanwhile, the locomotives could be uncoupled from the train and sent to the engine terminal to be serviced for their next assignment. Then, the head-end cars could be uncoupled from the rest of the train and spotted by a station switcher at the parcel facility where mail and express packages were handled. The departing train was reassembled, freshly cleaned and serviced for the next journey. A steam pipe from the station&#x27;s steam generator could have been attached to the train&#x27;s steam line from the rear to supply heat until the locomotives were coupled up front to supply steam.

The train was announced for boarding with a list of destinations. With switches aligned, the train slowly departed to the main line, continuing on its journey or returning toward the direction from which it arrived by rounding the opposite leg from the one it reversed on upon arrival.

The Keddie Wye in Keddie, California, was built by the Western Pacific Railroad and is a remarkable engineering feat. Two sides of the wye are built on tall trestles and one side is in a tunnel bored through solid rock.
The town of Wyeville, Wisconsin, is named after the Union Pacific Railway, formerly the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company wye and crossover nearby.

A primary feature of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system is the Oakland Wye. Located beneath Downtown Oakland, California, the vast majority of the system&#x27;s trains run through the wye primarily to and from San Francisco with some services running north and south along the East Bay. This section of track is considered a bottleneck for system-wide capacity based on speed restrictions and timing difficulties from distant branch lines.

The southern terminus of the Amtrak Auto Train in Sanford, Florida, uses a wye to turn the locomotives around for the return trip north. A road that crosses the eastern side of the wye allows access to the inner part of the wye where there is a rock supply company.

In Arizona, the Grand Canyon Railway (GCRY) has a wye at both the Williams and South Rim/Grand Canyon Village termini of its line. The train is turned around at the South Rim/Grand Canyon Village wye with the passengers on board. At the Williams end, the train is turned around after the passengers disembark.

The Chowchilla Wye is a primary feature of the planned California High-Speed Rail System. It will allow for transfers from feeder services on the third leg and facilitate more routing options as future phases are completed.

Hammel&#x27;s Wye is a primary feature of the IND Rockaway Line, serving A and Rockaway Park Shuttle trains all day. The wye was named after a past station, Hammels station.

== Convoluted wye ==

Convoluted wye, turning star or reversing star () is a special wye layout used in places where the space is tight. It has a pentagram-like form and consists of five turnouts (versus three for a wye) and three, four or five diamond crossings. Because of this, a reversing star is more expensive to build and service.

It takes four changes of direction of movement to turn a piece of rolling stock on a reversing star.

There was a &quot;star&quot; layout at the summit of the Brenner Pass, on the Austrian–Italian border. It was still there in 1991, covered over with gravel so that market-stalls could function on top.

<doc id="397982" wikidata="Q2816369" url="?curid=397982" title="369th Infantry Regiment (United States)">
<text>The 369th Infantry Regiment, originally formed as the 15th New York National Guard Regiment before it was re-organized as the 369th upon its federalization, and commonly referred to as the Harlem Hellfighters, was an infantry regiment of the New York Army National Guard during World War I and World War II. The regiment mainly consisted of African Americans, but it also included men from Puerto Rico, Cuba, Guyana, Liberia, Portugal, Canada, the West Indies, as well as white American officers. With the 370th Infantry Regiment, it was known for being one of the first African-American regiments to serve with the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I.

The regiment was named the &quot;Black Rattlers&quot; after arriving in France by its commander Colonel William Hayward. The nickname &quot;Men of Bronze&quot; () was given to the regiment by the French after they had witnessed the gallantry of the Americans fighting in the trenches. Legend has it that they were called the &quot;Hellfighters&quot; () by the German enemy, although there is no documentation of this and the moniker may have been a creation of the American press. During World War I, the 369th spent 191 days in front line trenches, more than any other American unit. They also suffered the most losses of any American regiment, with 1,500 casualties. The regiment was also the first of the Allied forces to cross the Rhine into Germany. The lineage of the 369th Infantry is perpetuated today by the 42nd Infantry Division Sustainment Brigade.

==Background==

On 5 October 1917, Emmett Jay Scott, long-time secretary to Booker T. Washington, was appointed Special Assistant to Newton D. Baker, the Secretary of War. Scott was to serve as a confidential advisor in situations that involved the well-being of ten million African Americans and their roles in the war. While many African Americans who served in the Great War believed racial discrimination would dissipate once they returned home, that did not happen. Racism in the United States is considered to have been among the worst instances between the First and Second World Wars. 

Although many African Americans were eager to fight in the war, they were often turned away from military service. When the United States realized that it did not have close to enough soldiers, it decided to pass the Selective Service Act of 1917 which required all men from the ages of 21 to 30 to register for the draft; this included African Americans. Many African Americans enlisted believing that their military service would give them the opportunity to change the way they were perceived by white Americans.

The 369th Regiment was reformed from the National Guard&#x27;s 15th Regiment in New York. The 15th New York National Guard was a state militia regiment which served to help suppress the 1863 New York City draft riots and was mustered into federal service for 30 days in June 1864, providing manpower for Army posts in the New York Harbor. The 15th Regiment was reconstituted after Charles S. Whitman was elected Governor of New York. He enforced the legislation that was passed due to the efforts of the 10th Cavalry in Mexico, which had passed as a law that had not manifested until June 2, 1913.

When the U.S. entered World War I, many African Americans believed that entering the armed forces would help eliminate racial discrimination throughout the United States. Many felt it was &quot;a God-sent blessing&quot; so they could prove they deserved respect from white Americans through service in the armed forces. On the other hand, many were forced through false promises of freedom and equality. Through the efforts of the Central Committee of Negro College Men and President Wilson, a special training camp to train black officers for the proposed black regiments was established.

==World War I==

===Formation===
The 369th Infantry Regiment was constituted on 2 June 1913 in the New York Army National Guard as the 15th New York Infantry Regiment. The 369th Infantry was organized on 29 June 1916 at New York City.

The infantry was called into Federal service on 25 July 1917 at Camp Whitman, New York. While at Camp Whitman, the 369th Infantry learned basic military practices. After their training at Camp Whitman, the 369th was called into active duty in New York. While in New York, the 369th&#x27;s three battalions were spread throughout New York where they guarded rail lines, construction sites, and other camps.

Then on 8 October 1917 the Regiment traveled to Camp Wadsworth in Spartanburg, South Carolina, where they received training in actual combat. Camp Wadsworth was set up similar to the French battlefields. While at Camp Wadsworth they experienced significant racism from the local communities and from other units. There was one incident in which two soldiers from the 15th Regiment, Lieutenant James Reese Europe and Noble Sissle, were refused by the owner of a hotel shop when they attempted to buy a newspaper. Several soldiers from the white 27th Division, a New York National Guard organization, came to stand with and support their fellow New York soldiers. Lieutenant Europe, however, directed them to leave before violence erupted. There were many other shops that refused to sell goods to the members of the 15th Regiment, so members of the 27th Division told the shop owners that if they did not serve black soldiers that they can close their stores and leave town. The white soldiers then stated &quot;They&#x27;re our buddies. And we won&#x27;t buy from men who treat them unfairly.&quot;

The 15th Infantry Regiment NYARNG was assigned on 1 December 1917 to the 185th Infantry Brigade. It was commanded by Col. William Hayward, a member of the Union League Club of New York, which sponsored the 369th in the tradition of the 20th U.S. Colored Infantry, which the club had sponsored in the U.S. Civil War. The 15th Infantry Regiment shipped out from the New York Port of Embarkation on 27 December 1917, and joined its brigade upon arrival in France. Despite its designation and training as an infantry regiment, the unit was relegated to labor service duties in France instead of being assigned a combat mission.

The 15th Infantry Regiment, NYARNG was reorganized and re-designated on 1 March 1918 as the 369th Infantry Regiment, but the unit continued labor service duties while it awaited a decision as to its future.

Because of the U.S. Army&#x27;s policy of continued segregation between African American and White units, it was decided on the 8th of April, 1918, to reassign the unit to the 16th Division of the 4th Army of the French Armed Forces for the duration of American participation in the war. Eventually the 369th Infantry were issued French weapons, helmets, belts, and pouches, although they continued to wear their U.S. uniforms. While in the United States, the Regiment was subjected to intense racial discrimination, and its members looked down upon. French Colonel of the American Expeditionary Forces headquarters was persuaded to write the notorious pamphlet &quot;Secret Information Concerning Black American Troops&quot;, which &quot;warned&quot; French civilian authorities of the alleged inferior nature and supposed racist tendencies of African Americans.

The 369th was largely treated similarly to other French units at the time. The regiment was not segregated from other French units, and generally faced little racial discrimination. Prior to the 369th&#x27;s integration, the French army had included many colonial units with non-white personnel, many from Morocco and Senegal. Having also faced severe manpower shortages, French soldiers shared less concern for race than Americans.

The 369th Infantry Regiment was relieved 8 May 1918 from assignment to the 185th Infantry Brigade and went into the trenches as part of the French 16th Division. It served continuously until 3 July before returning to combat in the Second Battle of the Marne. Later, the 369th was reassigned to Gen. Lebouc&#x27;s 161st Division to participate in the Allied counterattack. On one tour, they were out for over six months, which was the longest deployment of any unit in World War I. On 19 August, the regiment went off the line for rest and training of replacements.

While overseas, the Hellfighters saw enemy propaganda intended for them. It claimed Germans had done nothing wrong to African Americans, and they should be fighting the US, which had oppressed them for years. It had the opposite of the intended effect.

On 25 September 1918, the French 4th Army went on the offensive in conjunction with the American drive in the Meuse–Argonne. The 369th turned in a good account in heavy fighting, though they sustained severe losses. The unit captured the important village of Séchault. At one point the 369th advanced faster than French troops on their right and left flanks and risked being cut off. By the time the regiment pulled back for reorganization, it had advanced through severe German resistance.

In mid-October the regiment was moved to a quiet sector in the Vosges, and was stationed there on 11 November, the day of the Armistice. Six days later, the 369th made its last advance and on 26 November, reaching the banks of the river Rhine and becoming the first Allied unit to do so. The regiment was relieved on 12 December 1918 from assignment to the French 161st Division. When the regiment attempted to travel home on board the USS &quot;Virginia&quot;, the ship&#x27;s captain, Henry Joseph Ziegemeier, had them removed &quot;on the grounds that no blacks had ever traveled on an American battleship.&quot; It returned to the New York Port of Embarkation and was demobilized on 28 February 1919 at Camp Upton at Yaphank, New York, and returned to the New York Army National Guard.

===Honors===

One Medal of Honor and numerous Distinguished Service Crosses were awarded to members of the regiment.

Pvt. Henry Johnson, a former rail station porter from Albany, New York, earned widespread acclaim in the 369th for his extraordinary feats in combat in France, leading to the moniker &quot;Black Death.&quot; In May 1918, Johnson and Pvt. Needham Roberts valiantly repelled a 24-man German patrol, despite both sustaining severe injuries. Amidst the chaos, Johnson directed Roberts to alert the French units about the approaching enemy, but Roberts returned under gunfire. Together, they fought until a German grenade incapacitated Roberts. Undeterred, Johnson took it upon himself to maintain the defensive line and shield his comrade. With depleted ammunition, Johnson engaged the enemy using grenades, the rifle butt, and eventually a bolo knife. Reports suggest Johnson may have slain at least four German soldiers and wounded around 30 others, enduring at least 21 injuries himself. Recognizing their valor, over 100 men from the 369th received American and/or French decorations, with Johnson becoming the first American to be awarded the Croix de Guerre.

On 13 December 1918, one month after Armistice Day, the French government awarded the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; to 170 individual members of the 369th, and a unit citation was awarded to the entire regiment. It was pinned to the unit&#x27;s colors by General Lebouc.

One of the first units in the United States armed forces to have black officers in addition to all-black enlisted men, the 369th could boast of a fine combat record, a regimental Croix de Guerre, and several unit citations, along with many individual decorations for valor from the French government. Nevertheless, the poor replacement system —coupled with no respite from the line — took its toll, leaving the unit utterly exhausted by the armistice in November. The 369th Infantry Regiment was the first New York unit to return to the United States, and was the first unit to march up Fifth Avenue from the Washington Square Park Arch to their armory in Harlem. Their unit was placed on the permanent list with other veteran units.
Arthur W. Little, who had been a battalion commander for the 369th, wrote in the regimental history &quot;From Harlem to the Rhine&quot;, it was official that the outfit was 191 days under fire, never lost a foot of ground or had a man taken prisoner; on two occasions men were captured, but were recovered. Only once did it fail to take its objective and that was due largely to bungling by French artillery support.

By the end of the 369th Infantry&#x27;s campaign in World War, I they were present in the Champagne – Marne, Meuse – Argonne, Champagne 1918, Alsace 1918 campaigns in which they suffered 1,500 casualties, the highest of any U.S. regiment. In addition, the unit was plagued by acute discipline problems resulting from disproportionate casualties among the unit&#x27;s longest-serving members and related failures to assimilate new soldiers. The 369th also fought in distinguished battles such as Belleau Wood and Chateau-Thierry.

==369th Regiment Military Band==

The 369th Regiment &quot;Hellfighters Band&quot; was relied upon not only in battle but also for morale. So, by the end of their tour, they became one of the most famous military bands throughout Europe. They followed the 369th overseas and were highly regarded and known for being able to immediately boost morale. While overseas the 369th Regiment made up less than 1% of the soldiers deployed but was responsible for over 20% of the territory of all the land assigned to the United States. During the war the 369th&#x27;s regimental band (under the direction of James Reese Europe) became famous throughout Europe by introducing the until-then unknown music called jazz to the British, French and other European audiences.
At the end of the war, the 369th returned to New York City, and on 17 February 1919, paraded through the city. This day became an unofficial holiday of sorts for all of Harlem. Many black school children were dismissed from school so that they could attend the parade. With the addition of many adults there were thousands of people that lined the streets to see the 369th Regiment: the parade began on Fifth Avenue at 61st Street, proceeded uptown past ranks of white bystanders, turned west on 110th Street, and then turned onto Lenox Avenue, and marched into Harlem, where black New Yorkers packed the sidewalks to see them. The parade became a marker of African American service to the nation, a frequent point of reference for those campaigning for civil rights. There were multiple parades that took place throughout the nation, many of these parades included all black regiments, including the 370th from Illinois. Then in the 1920s and 1930s, the 369th was a regular presence on Harlem&#x27;s streets, each year marching through the neighborhood from their armory to catch a train to their annual summer camp, and then back through the neighborhood on their return two weeks later.

Tap dancer and actor Bill Robinson is frequently claimed to have been the drum major for the regimental band during the homecoming parade on Fifth Avenue upon the 369th&#x27;s return from overseas. This has however been questioned as it is not mentioned in either his biography by Jim Haskins or the biography of James Europe.

==Interwar period==

The 369th Infantry was demobilized on 28 February 1919 at Camp Upton. Per the National Defense Act of 1920, it was reconstituted in the National Guard on
19 October 1920 and allotted to the state of New York as a separate regiment. It was partially organized on 11 October 1921 by redesignation of active elements of the 15th Infantry, New York National Guard as the 369th Infantry. The regimental headquarters was organized and federally recognized on 6 September 1924 at Harlem. The regiment was attached on 17 June 1922 to the 44th Division&#x27;s 87th Infantry Brigade. It conducted annual summer training most years at Camp Smith, near Peekskill, New York, from 1924 to 1939. It was assigned to the First Army on 1 October 1933, but remained attached to the 87th Infantry Brigade for command, control, and administration. In 1938, Benjamin O. Davis Sr. became the regimental commander. He would eventually lead a reorganization that saw the regiment, less the Service Company and 3rd Battalion, converted into the 369th Coast Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft) on 30 August 1940. The 369th Coast Artillery was attached to the First Army on 30 December 1940. It was inducted into federal service on 13 January 1941 at Harlem, and transferred to Fort Ontario, New York, arriving there on 15 January 1941 where it was assigned to the Northeast Defense Command. It was transferred again on 5 September 1941 to Camp Edwards, Massachusetts.

==World War II==

After U.S. entry into World War II, the 369th Coast Artillery was transferred to Los Angeles, California, on 5 May 1942. It staged at Camp Stoneman, near Pittsburg, California from 1 June until 16 June, when it departed the San Francisco Port of Embarkation, arriving in Hawaii on 21 June. On 12 December 1943, the 369th Coast Artillery was broken up, with the headquarters and headquarters battery redesignated the Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 369th Antiaircraft Artillery Group, the 1st Battalion as the 369th Antiaircraft Artillery Gun Battalion, and the 2nd Battalion as the 870th Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion.

===369th Infantry Regiment (Army of the United States)===

On 15 May 1942, the 369th Infantry Regiment was re-established as an element of the 93rd Infantry Division (Colored) in the Army of the United States; this iteration of the 369th Infantry does not have any lineal connection with the 15th New York established before World War I and that is still active in the present day. It was deployed overseas and participated in labor and security operations in the Southwest Pacific Area. The 369th, along with the rest of the 93rd Infantry Division, occupied Morotai in Dutch New Guinea from April to June 1945, seeing limited combat. The division redeployed to Zamboanga in the Philippines on 1 July 1945, where it conducted &quot;mop up&quot; patrols until the Japanese surrendered on 15 August. The 369th left the Philippines with the division on 17 January 1946, returning to the United States on 1 February. The unit was deactivated two days later.

==Armory==
In 1933, the 369th Regiment Armory was created to honor the 369th regiment for their service. This armory stands at 142nd and Fifth Avenue, in the heart of Harlem. This armory was constructed starting in the 1920s and was completed in the 1930s. The 369th Regiment Armory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 and was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1985.

==Later years==
The infantry&#x27;s polished post-World War I reputation was not completely safe from external criticism, which ultimately surfaced as a result of ongoing racial tension in the United States. In 1940, the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; reported that the United States Department of War arranged for the 369th regiment to be renamed the &quot;Colored Infantry.&quot; The department announced that there were too many infantry units in the national guard and the 369th regiment would be among those slated to go, the first alleged step toward abolishing the famed unit. Supporters of the regiment swiftly objected to the introduction of racial identity in the title of a unit in the United States army, effectively preserving the regiment&#x27;s reputation. However, eventually, all African American US Army units were renamed as &quot;Colored,&quot; and the 369th served in World War II as the 369th Coast Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft) (Colored), with its successor being the 369th Infantry Regiment (Colored).

In 2003, the New York State Department of Transportation renamed the Harlem River Drive as the &quot;Harlem Hellfighters Drive.&quot; On 29 September 2006 a twelve-foot-high monument was unveiled to honor the 369th Regiment. This statue is a replica of a monument that stands in France. The monument is made of black granite and contains the 369th crest and rattlesnake insignia.

The Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to the regiment in August 2021 in recognition of their bravery and outstanding service during World War I.

==Distinctive unit insignia==
; Description

A silver color metal and enamel device in height overall consisting of a blue shield charged with a silver rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike.
; Symbolism
The rattlesnake is a symbol used on some colonial flags and is associated with the thirteen original colonies. The silver rattlesnake on the blue shield was the distinctive regimental insignia of the 369th Infantry Regiment, ancestor of the unit, and alludes to the service of the organization during World War I.

; Background

The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 369th Infantry Regiment on 17 April 1923. It was redesignated for the 369th Coast Artillery Regiment on 3 December 1940. It was redesignated for the 369th Antiaircraft Artillery Gun Battalion on 7 January 1944. It was redesignated for the 569th Field Artillery Battalion on 14 August 1956. The insignia was redesignated for the 369th Artillery Regiment on 4 April 1962. It was amended to correct the wording of the description on 2 September 1964. It was redesignated for the 569th Transportation Battalion and amended to add a motto on 13 March 1969. The insignia was redesignated for the 369th Transportation Battalion and amended to delete the motto on 14 January 1975. It was redesignated for the 369th Support Battalion and amended to revise the description and symbolism on 2 November 1994. The insignia was redesignated for the 369th Sustainment Brigade and amended to revise the description and symbolism on 20 July 2007.

==369th Veterans&#x27; Association==
The 369th Veterans&#x27; Association is a group created to honor those who served in the 369th infantry. This veterans group has three distinct goals. According to the Legal Information Institute of the Cornell Law Institute these include, &quot;promoting the principles of friendship and goodwill among its members; engaging in social and civic activities that tend to enhance the welfare of its members and inculcate the true principles of good citizenship in its members; and memorializing, individually and collectively, the patriotic services of its members in the 369th antiaircraft artillery group and other units in the Armed Forces of the United States.&quot;

==Depiction in media==
Fictionalized accounts which feature the Harlem Hellfighters include the 2014 graphic novel &quot;The Harlem Hellfighters&quot; written by Max Brooks and illustrated by Caanan White. It depicts a fictionalized account of the 369th&#x27;s tour in Europe during World War I. a film adaptation of the aforementioned novel is in the works under Sony Pictures and Overbrook Entertainment.

The Harlem Hellfighters appear in &quot;Battlefield 1&quot; during the prologue mission. The unit features as a pre-order bonus as well, featuring a Hellfighter statue. The Hellfighter Pack also features as a pre-order bonus from GameStop, giving players access to unique emblems and weapon skins.

In 2018, the 369th Infantry Regiment became a part of the documentary &quot;Noble Sissle&#x27;s Syncopated Ragtime&quot;, directed and produced by Daniel L. Bernardi and David de Rozas with the collaboration of El Dorado Films and the Veteran Documentary Corps. The film subject is musician and Harlem Hellfighters&#x27; soldier Noble Sissle, the documentary won Best US Documentary Feature Film at the 2019 American Documentary Film Festival and Film Fund.

The song &quot;Hellfighters&quot;, recorded by Swedish power metal band Sabaton for their 2022 album &quot;The War to End All Wars&quot;, is about the 369th Infantry Regiment.

In Valiant Hearts: Coming Home the 369th Infantry Regiment is depicted and is to honor those who served in the Harlem Hellfighters during World War I.
