<text>Sir Colville Norbert Young (born 20 November 1932) is a Belizean politician who served as the second governor-general of Belize. He is also a patron of the Scout Association of Belize. He was appointed as the Governor-General in 1993, taking office on 17 November of that year, and was knighted in 1994.

His tenure of 28 years is the longest of any governor-general in the history of the Commonwealth.

==Education==
Sir Colville studied at Belize&#x27;s St Michael&#x27;s College (now part of Anglican Cathedral College (ACC) and not to be confused with the institution now known as Maud Williams High School), and earned a BA degree in English from the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, Jamaica, prior to his doctorate in linguistics from the University of York in England. Young was a Fulbright Scholar and is a member of the Caribbean Teachers of English Association and the Society for Caribbean Linguistics.

== Career ==
In the 1960s, Young was a member of the opposition National Independence Party. He ran as the NIP candidate for the British Honduras Legislative Assembly in the Mesopotamia constituency in 1965 and 1969, but was defeated both times by C. L. B. Rogers, the People&#x27;s United Party incumbent.

Along with future Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, Young was one of the founding members of the Liberal Party, a short-lived pro-business political party which ultimately became a part of the United Democratic Party (UDP). Afterwards Young was interested in seeing Belize&#x27;s development in academia and education, and after returning from England began trying to advance the nation in that regard. In the late 1980s Young became president of the University College of Belize, one of the five parent institutions of the University of Belize, and was one of its senior lecturers.

He became involved in music, composing all manner of musical pieces from operas to cantatas to others. He published a series of books of and about Belizean literature, including &quot;Literature and Education in Belize&quot;, &quot;Creole Proverbs of Belize&quot;, &quot;From One Caribbean Corner&quot; and &quot;Caribbean Corner Calling&quot;, the last two containing poems in English and Belize Creole. Of these books, &quot;Creole Proverbs&quot; is his most recognised. In 1993, just before becoming Governor General, he published a book of short stories called &quot;Pataki Full&quot;, earning acclaim from the local writing community. His stories have been featured in the Belizean Writers Series in &quot;Snapshots of Belize&quot;, and a play &quot;Riding Haas&quot; in the drama anthology &quot;Ping Wing Juk Me&quot;, also in the Series.

==Governor-General of Belize (1993–2021)==

Young became the Belizean governor-general shortly after the UDP under Esquivel regained power in the 1993 elections. He is the longest-serving governor-general of all time
in the Commonwealth. Young is active in creating and maintaining relations with foreign dignitaries and countries. He was sworn into the Privy Council upon his assumption of office. He is also active within the larger community in Belize, specifically in education and teacher training.

In 2017, several fake and unauthorized Facebook profiles were created under the name &quot;Colville Young&quot;. Citizens were warned not to interact with the profiles as all communication from the governor is shared by the Government of Belize Press Office.

Young retired as Governor-General on 30 April 2021. Froyla Tzalam succeeded him as Governor-General on 27 May 2021.

==Personal life and interests==

Young is married to Lady (Norma) Young, née Trapp, and has three sons and a daughter. He has three siblings.

Young has a stated interest in promoting the development of Belizean music. Young has actively contributed to efforts in Belizean schools to maintain music as an educational staple. Young&#x27;s son, Colville Young Jr., is the director of the Belize National Youth Symphony. Currently Colville Young is working with founders of the Belize Virtuosi Orchestra, Joel Nagel and Peter Illavsky, to raise funds to build a chamber orchestra auditorium in Belize. Young established the Governor General&#x27;s Music in the Schools Programme which works with partner abroad to expand music in schools and access to musical instruments.

<text>Sir Daniel Charles Williams COG (4 November 1935 – 2 October 2024) was a Grenadian lawyer who served as governor-general of Grenada from 8 August 1996 until 18 November 2008. He was formally appointed by Queen Elizabeth II on 9 August 1996 after having been nominated by Prime Minister Keith Mitchell.

Williams was the only former Grenadian governor-general who had been active in politics prior to his appointment. He was elected to the Parliament of Grenada as a New National Party candidate in 1984. From 1984 to 1989, Williams served in various ministerial roles in the Herbert Blaize government, including a brief stint as acting prime minister in 1988. Williams resumed his private law practice after the NNP was defeated at the 1990 elections.

In 1996, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (GCMG).

Williams founded the law firm Danny Williams &amp; Co. He died on 2 October 2024, at the age of 88.

<text>Sir William Jack Skate (26 September 1953 – 3 January 2006) was a prominent Papua New Guinea politician. He was the son of an Australian father and a Papua New Guinean mother. Though his career was turbulent and often marked by setbacks, he served in the highest posts in his country: prime minister of Papua New Guinea, speaker of the National Parliament, and as acting governor-general of Papua New Guinea.

== Life ==
Skate became manager of the capital district commission in 1987. He was elected to parliament in 1992 and served as speaker from 1992 to 1994, supporting the government of Paias Wingti.

Skate served as governor of the National Capital District from 1995 to 1997. He was prime minister from 1997 to 1999 and resigned after 18 months, fearing that he would lose a challenge. He was appointed Leader of the Opposition from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, his political party the People&#x27;s National Congress Party (PNC) became a coalition partner in the government of Michael Somare and Skate became Speaker of the National Parliament. He was appointed acting governor-general in November 2003, a constitutional requirement when that office falls vacant. Pato Kakeraya was scheduled to take up the office on 20 January 2004, but Skate continued to act in the office because of court challenges to Kakeraya&#x27;s election.

On 3 March 2004, Skate was suspended as acting governor-general because of allegations that he misappropriated funds during the 1990s. He then advised the Prime Minister to appoint a cabinet minister as acting governor-general. The following day, however, he was cleared of the financial charges in court, and he became acting governor-general again. In May 2004, his party left the coalition when he and other members refused to support a constitutional amendment supported by Somare which would have given the government more time to be immune to no-confidence votes. As a result, the PNC became the largest opposition party.

On 28 May 2004, Skate ceased to be Speaker when the parliament elected a pro-government candidate, Jeffery Nape. The office of governor-general was still vacant at that stage, so Nape automatically succeeded Skate as acting governor-general.

Bill Skate was knighted in January 2005 for services to parliament, becoming Sir William Skate.

He died in hospital on 3 January 2006, in Brisbane, Australia, where he had been airlifted after suffering a stroke in late December 2005 which was probably an effect of chronic alcoholism. He was buried in Port Moresby.

<doc id="395082" wikidata="Q2873102" url="?curid=395082" title="Autzen Stadium">
<text>Autzen Stadium is an outdoor football stadium in Eugene, Oregon, United States. Located north of the University of Oregon campus, it is the home field of the Oregon Ducks of the Big Ten Conference. Opened in 1967, the stadium has undergone several expansions. The official seating capacity is presently 54,000 to 60,000 (with SRO); however, the actual attendance regularly exceeds that figure.

==History==
Prior to 1967, the Ducks&#x27; on-campus stadium was Hayward Field, which they shared with the track and field team. However, by the late 1950s, it had become apparent that Hayward Field was no longer suitable for the football team. It seated only 22,500 people, making it one of the smallest in the University Division (now Division I), and only 9,000 seats were available to the general public. While nearly every seat was protected from the elements, it had little else going for it. The stadium was in such poor condition that coaches deliberately kept prospective recruits from seeing it. As a result, the Ducks only played three home games per year on campus in most years; with the exception of the annual rivalry game with Oregon State, games that were likely to draw big crowds (against schools like Washington and USC) were played north in Portland at the larger Multnomah Stadium. With the recognition that the football team had outgrown the campus facility and with popular support to play the entire home schedule in Eugene for the first time in school history, Oregon athletic director Leo Harris led a campaign to build a new stadium on that the school had acquired for the purpose in the 1950s on his recommendation.

Designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the stadium was built within an artificial landfill (over the refuse) to eliminate the need for multilevel ramps. As a result, construction took just nine months and cost approximately $2.3 million. $250,000 was contributed by the Autzen Foundation, headed by Thomas E. Autzen (class of 1943), son of Portland lumberman and philanthropist Thomas J. Autzen (1888–1958), for whom the stadium was named. The elder Autzen was ironically an alumnus of Oregon archrival Oregon State University.

In 1967, Oregon hosted Colorado in Autzen Stadium&#x27;s inaugural game, a 17–13 loss before 27,500 on September 23. Four weeks later on October 21, 16,000 saw Oregon&#x27;s first win in the new facility; the 31–6 victory over Idaho was the only home win of the season.

The stadium alternates with Oregon State&#x27;s Reser Stadium as host of the annual rivalry game with the Beavers.

Autzen hosted the inaugural Pac-12 Conference Championship game on December 2, 2011, as the Pac-12 North champion Ducks defeated the Pac-12 South champion UCLA Bruins.

===Playing surface===

Opened with natural grass in 1967, the field was switched to AstroTurf and lights were added for its third season in 1969. After seven years, it was replaced with new AstroTurf in 1976. Sand-based OmniTurf was installed in 1984 and 1991, and infilled NeXturf in 2001. The NeXturf was found to be overly slick when wet and lasted only one season, and was transferred to an intramural field. FieldTurf made its debut in Autzen in 2002, and was replaced in 2010.

With up to 8 feet (2.4 m) of gravel fill underneath the field, the original crown of the natural grass field was moderate, with the center of the field approximately one foot (0.30 m) higher than the sidelines. The crown was removed in 2010, and the surface is now flat.

==Renovations==
In 1982, a $650,000 meeting room complex, the Donald Barker Stadium Club, was opened on the east rim above the end zone. It gave the stadium its first meeting facilities, and was dedicated at the home opener in September.

A proposal to enclose the stadium within a dome was given serious consideration in 1985. New tax laws on contributions altered the feasibility, and the overall project was scaled back. In 1988, a $2.3 million renovation built a new press box on the south side of the stadium and converted the original north side press box to luxury suites. The renovation was designed by architecture firm Ellerbe Becket.

In 1995, the field was named Rich Brooks Field, after the Ducks&#x27; coach from 1977 to 1994. Brooks led Oregon to its first outright Pac-10 championship, and its first Rose Bowl appearance in 37 years, in his last season. Brooks left Oregon after the 1994 season to become head coach of the St. Louis Rams of the National Football League.

In 2002, a $90 million facelift and expansion added seating and luxury boxes to the south sideline, bringing the stadium seating capacity up to its current level.
In 2007, the large yellow &quot;O&quot; was added onto the south end of the stadium exterior when ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College GameDay&quot; was on location. That season, &quot;Gameday&quot; originated two of its Saturday shows from Eugene.
In 2008, a new, high-definition LED scoreboard and replay screen—known as &quot;DuckVision&quot; or &quot;Duckvision 2.0&quot;—was installed; it replaced the original video screen installed prior to the 1998–1999 football season. It is the 39th largest video screen in the NCAA.

In 2010, the field was replaced with new FieldTurf that featured the new Pac-12 logo (even before the logo was officially revealed to the public). During the process, the crown was removed to make the field flat. In addition, new paneling was added to the walls surrounding the field.

In 2014, the east end-zone scoreboard was updated to include a digital screen, the addition of 150 flat screen monitors throughout the concessions areas, additional culinary options in the form of food trucks on the north side of the stadium, increased cell phone repeaters and an upgrade to the sound system. Additionally, the sideline wall graphics were updated from the new panels installed in the 2010 season.

In 2020 the east end-zone scoreboard was replaced with a new 186’ x 66’ video screen on the east end of the stadium, making it the largest video board in college football. The video board will also house a smaller outward-facing 47’ x 26’ video board visible to fans arriving to the stadium.

==Stadium records==
The highest attendance at Autzen was 60,129 on October 12, 2024, when the Ducks beat Ohio State, 32–31. This stands as the second largest crowd for a sporting event in the state of Oregon, with the largest being the CART Portland 200 IndyCar event in 1993, which claimed an estimated attendance of 63,000.

From 1997 to 2001, the Ducks had a 24-game home winning streak at Autzen Stadium, which ended with a 49–42 loss to Stanford.
In 2011, the USC Trojans defeated the Ducks 38–35, ending a 21-game home winning streak as the Trojans handed Chip Kelly his first loss at Autzen as head coach.
==Attendance==

Sellout. &quot;Conference Championship Game&quot;. Attendance Record. 1 – Thursday Night Game. 2 – Friday Night Game. 3 – ESPN&#x27;s College GameDay.

==Location and configuration==

The stadium is located just north of the Willamette River, next to Alton Baker Park. Students typically walk to the stadium from the University of Oregon campus over the Autzen Footbridge, which passes over the Willamette, then through Alton Baker Park. The FieldTurf playing field is at an elevation of above sea level and is laid out in a non-traditional east-west orientation, slightly skewed so that players will not have the sun shining in their eyes in late fall.

==Crowd noise==
Autzen is known for its crowd noise. Due to the stadium&#x27;s relatively small footprint, the fans are very close to the action, and the field is sunken. These factors contribute to the loudness of the stadium even though it is smaller than other &#x27;noise comparable&#x27; stadiums. According to many in the Pac-12, from Oregon&#x27;s resurgence in the mid-1990s until the most recent expansion in 2002, Autzen was even louder because the noise reverberated all the way up the stadium and bounced back down to the field—the so-called &quot;Autzen bounce.&quot; Oregon officials say that any future expansions will trap more noise.

On October 27, 2007, during a 24–17 victory against the USC Trojans, a then-record crowd of 59,277 fans was recorded at 127.2 decibels. A similarly loud 31–27 upset of third-ranked Michigan in 2003 prompted &quot;Michigan Daily&quot; columnist J. Brady McCollough to write

Michigan coach Lloyd Carr later said that Autzen Stadium was the loudest stadium he&#x27;d ever been in.
In 2006, a &quot;Sporting News&quot; columnist named Autzen the most intimidating college football stadium in the nation.

Lee Corso of ESPN College Gameday frequently says, &quot;Per person Autzen Stadium is the loudest stadium that I have ever been in my entire life!&quot;

Longtime ABC sportscaster Keith Jackson called Autzen &quot;Per square yard, the loudest stadium in the history of the planet.&quot;

Jahvid Best, a former starting running back for the Detroit Lions, visited Autzen while playing for the California Golden Bears in 2007. He later said, &quot;The biggest thing I remember about that game is the crowd. The crowd noise is crazy up there. Honestly, any other away game I don&#x27;t really even hear the crowd. Oregon was the only place where it really got on my nerves.&quot;

Following the September 6, 2014 game against the Michigan State Spartans, Michigan sports reporter Mike Griffin of MLive.com accused Oregon of piping in artificial noise that contributed to the Ducks&#x27; victory over the Spartans.

==Traditions==
Since 1990, Don Essig, the stadium&#x27;s PA announcer since 1968, has declared that &quot;It never rains in Autzen Stadium&quot; before each home game as the crowd chants along in unison. He often prefaces it with the local weather forecast, which quite often includes some chance of showers, but reminds fans that &quot;we know the &quot;real&quot; forecast...&quot; or &quot;let&#x27;s tell our friends from (visiting team name) the &quot;real&quot; forecast...&quot; If rain is actually falling before the game, Essig will often dismiss it as &quot;a light drizzle&quot;, or &quot;liquid sunshine&quot; but not &quot;actual&quot; rain by Oregon standards. Also, because of the use of Autzen Stadium and the University of Oregon campus in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, the toga party scene of the movie featuring the song &quot;Shout&quot; is played at the end of the third quarter, with the crowd dancing to the song.

Prior to the football team taking the field, a highlight video of previous games is shown on the jumbotron, nicknamed &quot;Duckvision&quot;. The last highlight on the clip is almost always Kenny Wheaton&#x27;s game-clinching 97-yard interception return for a touchdown against the Washington Huskies in 1994. &quot;The Pick&quot; is often seen as the turning point for Oregon football, which went on to the Rose Bowl that year and have enjoyed success for the most part ever since after years of losing records.

After the video, the team takes the field behind a motorcycle with the Oregon Duck riding on back to the strains of &quot;Mighty Oregon&quot;. This is followed by the north side of the stadium chanting &quot;GO&quot; with the south side chanting &quot;DUCKS!&quot;.

After every Duck score and win, a train horn blares. In addition, the Oregon Duck mascot does as many pushups as Oregon has points at that time.

==ESPN College Gameday==
ESPN&#x27;s College GameDay program came to Eugene for games played in Autzen Stadium six straight years, from 2009 through 2014, the most of any other school during that period. Overall, GameDay has made twelve visits to Oregon, most recently in 2024 against the Ohio State Buckeyes, and the Ducks have been a part of 31 GameDay broadcasts, either at Autzen or as a visiting team. Oregon has the tenth most appearances, posting a record.

==Other uses==
Autzen Stadium is the largest sports arena in the state of Oregon. In 1970, the San Francisco 49ers defeated the Denver Broncos 23-7 in an exhibition game at Autzen Stadium in front of a crowd of 26,238.

State high school football championship games were played at Autzen Stadium until 2006. It also hosts football camps, coaches&#x27; clinics, marching band competitions, and musical concerts.

Nitro Circus Live was held at the stadium in 2016 and 2018.

===Concerts===
The Grateful Dead used the stadium as a tour stop ten times between 1978 and 1994, including a 1987 show with Bob Dylan during which a portion of their collaborative live album entitled &quot;Dylan &amp; the Dead&quot; was recorded.

===In Film===
It was also used as the location for the fictional Faber College football stadium in the 1978 movie, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;. There is a well-known geographical error made during a scene set inside the stadium when Pacific-10 conference banners can clearly be seen in the background, even though the fictional Faber College is supposed to be located in Tennessee as shown by the state flag in the hearing room for the Delta House probation case.

===Soccer===
On July 24, 2016, Autzen Stadium hosted a 2016 International Champions Cup match between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, which was won by Paris Saint-Germain by a score of 3-1.

<text>Dame Calliopa Pearlette Louisy (born 8 June 1946) is a Saint Lucian academic, who served as governor-general of Saint Lucia from 19 September 1997, until her resignation on 31 December 2017. She is the first woman to hold the vice-regal office, as well as the longest-serving governor-general in the history of Saint Lucia.

==Biography==
Born in the village of Laborie, Saint Lucia, Louisy attended the Laborie Infant School and Primary Schools. In 1960 she proceeded to the St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent on the Javouhey Scholarship. In 1966, a year after the completion of her secondary education she was awarded the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) scholarship to pursue a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and French at the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill, Barbados.

In 1972, she was awarded the Canadian Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan to pursue a M.A. degree in linguistics, in the field of Didactics at Université Laval in Quebec City, Canada. In 1991, she proceeded to the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, where she read for a Ph.D. degree in education.

Louisy has contributed significantly to the development of Education in Saint Lucia, having spent most of her professional life in the teaching profession. During the periods 1969–72 and 1975–76, she taught at the St Joseph&#x27;s Convent. From 1976 to 1986, she served as a tutor of French, and was subsequently appointed as Principal of the St. Lucia A Level College. When the A Level College and Morne Technical School merged into the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College, she first served as Dean, and was subsequently appointed as the Vice Principal and Principal of the college.

In 1999, Louisy was awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) by the University of Bristol. On 16 July 1999, she was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. In 2011, she received an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LLB) from the University of West Indies.

<text>Sir Frederick Nathaniel Ballantyne, (5 July 1936 – 23 January 2020) was the Governor-General of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from 2002–2019. A trained cardiologist and former chief medical officer of the country, he was appointed governor-general on 22 June 2002. He succeeded Dame Monica Dacon, who had been acting in the position after the death of Charles Antrobus.

==Early life and medical career==
Ballantyne was born on 5 July 1936, an only child. His father owned a small hotel, and he has described himself as &quot;from a business family&quot;. Ballantyne was the first member of his family to attend high school. On the advice of an acquaintance who had studied medicine in the United States, he chose to attend university in that country (rather than in Britain or Canada, as was usual for Vincentians at the time). He completed an initial degree in chemistry at Howard University (in Washington, D.C.), and then went on to the SUNY Upstate Medical University (in Syracuse, New York) to study medicine. The &quot;sole black individual&quot; enrolled in the medical school, Ballantyne was elected to student government in every year of his degree, and in his final year was elected student body president. He interned in at the Montreal General Hospital after graduation, and then completed his residency in internal medicine in Rochester, New York, followed by a fellowship in cardiology.

Upon returning to Saint Vincent in 1971, Ballantyne was &quot;the most highly trained physician on the island&quot;. He was consequently appointed chief of medicine at the newly constructed Kingstown General Hospital (now called the Milton Cato Memorial Hospital). Ballantyne oversaw upgrades in the facilities of both the hospital and regional health clinics, with one of his first priorities being to expand the hospital&#x27;s immunisation program. He also instituted the hospital&#x27;s Visiting Specialist Program, which recruited overseas medical specialists to volunteer in Saint Vincent&#x27;s hospitals in exchange for free accommodation in the country&#x27;s resorts. In 1985, Ballantyne was appointed Saint Vincent&#x27;s chief medical officer, serving in the position until 1992. He remained involved in medicine after his official retirement from practising, in a consulting role. 

Outside of his career in the medical field, Ballantyne had business interests in several other areas. Prior to being appointed governor-general, he served as president of the Millennium Bank, an offshore bank registered in Saint Vincent, and also as president of Dimethaid International Inc., a pharmaceutical company registered in Barbados. He was also the founder of International Business Services Limited (IBS), a financial services provider now run by his son, Marcus, and a co-owner of the Young Island Resort, a tourist resort on a small island off Saint Vincent&#x27;s southern coast.

==Governor-General==
Ballantyne was sworn in as Governor-General of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on 22 June 2002, having been nominated to the position by the country&#x27;s prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves. He replaced Dame Monica Dacon, who had been acting governor-general since the death of Sir Charles Antrobus in 3 June 2002. Later in the year 2002, in connection with his new appointment, he was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George by Queen Elizabeth II. In June 2009, Ballantyne was also awarded a Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) degree by the University of the West Indies (UWI), as one of sixteen regional figures being recognised for their contributions with honorary degrees.

<doc id="395098" wikidata="Q1139461" url="?curid=395098" title="Salem bin Laden">
<text>Salem bin Laden () (4 January 1946 – 29 May 1988) was a Saudi Arabian investor and businessman.

==Life==
Salem was the eldest son of Muhammad bin Laden, the founder of the Saudi Binladin Group, and a half-brother of the militant jihadist Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was educated at Millfield and acted as the patriarch of the bin Laden family after the 1967 death of his father. Salem managed the family&#x27;s extensive investment portfolio and was in charge of the family income distribution. He also oversaw the individual education plans for each of his (half-) brothers and (half-) sisters. Just like his father, he highly valued the close relationship of the bin Ladens with the Saudi royal family. He provided means and support to the family during the Mecca uprising of 1979.

George W. Bush knew James Bath, a Texan businessman who served as the North American representative for rich Saudis among Bin Laden relatives, and using Bath connections he met billionaire Salem bin Laden, banker and BCCI Khalid bin Mahfouz. The two Saudis were willing to invest in the oil business. Salem bin Laden was one of the investors in the Arbusto oil company, created by George W. Bush in 1979.

He owned a house in Orlando, Florida, and often used it for vacation stays.

==Death==
Salem bin Laden died on 29 May 1988, in a plane crash in an ultralight aircraft that he was personally piloting. During the flight, he accidentally collided with high-voltage electrical power lines adjacent to the Kitty Hawk airfield on the outskirts of Schertz, a suburb of San Antonio, Texas. The Sprint ultralight aircraft he was flying fell 115 feet to the ground after the wire strike. Salem, who was not wearing a safety helmet, died of head injuries from the resulting fall. The National Transportation Safety Board did not investigate the incident because ultralight aircraft, like the one Salem was flying, fell outside their jurisdiction per FAR Part 103 Provisions, exempting such aircraft from their mandate. The Schertz Police, who attended to the incident, stated in their report that Salem died in a &quot;freak accident&quot;.

Following his death, Salem&#x27;s body was transported back to Saudi Arabia and accorded the honor of a burial in Medina, one of the most sacred cities in the Islamic world. A significant memorial event was held at the bin Laden family compound in Jeddah, spanning two days. All of the twenty-two bin Laden sons formed a line to receive the thousands of guests attending the funeral. Salem, who had secured a billion-dollar contract in the early 1980s for the innovation of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque, had effectively managed his father&#x27;s business and had been instrumental to the family&#x27;s ongoing success and prosperity. The memorial served as a testament to Salem&#x27;s contributions and the deep respect held for him within the family and the community.

This was the second plane crash-related death in the bin Laden family, as Salem&#x27;s father, Muhammed bin Laden, also died in a plane crash in 1967.

A third plane crash claimed more members of the bin Laden family on 31 July 2015 when a business jet carrying Osama bin Laden&#x27;s half-sister, Sana, and his stepmother, Rajaa Hashim, crashed at Blackbushe airport in Hampshire, England.

<text>Sir Vere Cornwall Bird, KNH (9 December 1909 – 28 June 1999) was the first Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda. His son, Lester Bryant Bird, succeeded him as prime minister. In 1994, he was declared a &quot;National Hero&quot;.

He was an officer in the Salvation Army for 2 years. In 1943, he became the president of the Antigua Trades and Labour Union. He achieved national acclaim politically for the first time when he was elected to the colonial legislature in 1945. He formed the Antigua Labour Party and became the first and only chief minister, first and last premier, and first prime minister from 1981 to 1994. His resignation was due to failing health and internal issues within the government.

In 1985 Antigua&#x27;s international airport, which was first named Coolidge International Airport, was renamed V.C. Bird International Airport in his honour.

==Early life and education ==

Bird was born in a poor area of St John&#x27;s, the capital. Unlike most of his political contemporaries – such as Norman Manley of Jamaica and Sir Grantley Herbert Adams of Barbados, who were distinguished lawyers, and Trinidadian Eric Williams, a scholar – Bird had little formal education except primary schooling. He attended St John&#x27;s Boys School, now known as the T.N. Kirnon Primary School.

==Political career==

===Positions in Antigua===
Bird was an officer in the Salvation Army for two years interspersing his interests in trade unionism and politics. He gave up the Salvation Army because he saw the way the landowners were treating the local black Antiguans and Barbudans, so he decided to leave his post to fight for the freedom of his people. 

When the Antigua Trades and Labour Union (ATLU) was formed in 1939, Bird was an executive member. By 1943 he had become president of the union and was leading a battle for better working conditions and increased pay against the white sugar barons. The union entered electoral politics for the first time in 1946 and Bird won, in a by-election, a seat in the legislature and was appointed a member of the Executive Council.

When universal adult suffrage was introduced here in 1951, the ATLU, under the banner of the Antigua Labour Party, won all seats in the legislature, a feat it repeated until 1967, making Antigua a country with a multi-party system but with freely voted one-party control. The ministerial system was introduced in 1956 and the Governor gave Bird the trade and production portfolio, and when further constitutional advancement came in 1960, he was named Chief Minister.

In 1967, Antigua became the first Eastern Caribbean island to receive the associated statehood constitution from Britain that gave internal self-government but with London remaining responsible for foreign policy and defence.

Bird, radical in his younger days, had been shifting to the right, and in the face of severe social unrest that forced a split in the ATLU in 1967 and rioting in 1968, the ATLU lost its tight hold of Antigua and Barbuda politics. Out of the split, the Antigua Workers Union was formed and later the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM), and Bird decided to resign because he felt it was not right to hold both positions.

In 1968 the PLM won four seats in a by-election and by 1971 Bird was out of power, having not only lost the government to the PLM but also the parliamentary seat he had held for 25 years. A former Lieutenant, the PLM&#x27;s George Walter, became the island&#x27;s new premier.

Bird&#x27;s political exile was to last for only five years and by 1976, he regained the government, having campaigned against independence on the grounds that Antigua was not yet psychologically ready. He won the election again in 1980, this time with independence being a major campaign plank. With his powerful family, he ruled Antigua and Barbuda up to 1994, when he quit politics, having paved the way for one of his sons, Lester, to take over as prime minister.

* Chief Minister of Antigua from 1 January 1960 to 27 February 1967
* Premier of Antigua from 27 February 1967 to 14 February 1971
* Premier of Antigua from 1 February 1976 to 1 November 1981
* Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda from 1 November 1981 to 9 March 1994.

=== Criticism and praise ===
A common criticism from the Antiguan public is the corruption and cronyism within the Labour Party, with many claiming the government is essentially a &quot;family business&quot; with the continuance of the Bird dynasty in control of political power as unquestioned.

Bird&#x27;s supporters reject these accusations and say that his actions were justified to throw off the institution of colonial sugar planters and the British colonial overlords. The Antiguan author Jamaica Kincaid compared the Bird government to the François Duvalier dictatorship in Haiti in her politically charged narrative &quot;A Small Place&quot;.

Bird was a member of an elite group of militant trade unionists who blazed a trail through colonial times up to or near the political independence of the Caribbean countries. The group included Alexander Bustamante and Norman Manley of Jamaica, Robert Bradshaw of St Kitts and Nevis, Grantley Adams of Barbados, Cheddi Jagan of Guyana, Ebenezer Joshua of St Vincent and the Grenadines and Eric Gairy of Grenada. Bird was among the early organizers of labour in colonial Antigua and Barbuda of the 1930s and 1940s. His biggest battles were fought in the sugar industry, where he achieved better wages for workers and recognition of the right of workers to have annual holidays with pay.

Bird, an imposing figure (standing at 7 feet tall) even in his last years, was astute enough to recognise that those benefits would be limited as long as the big landowners held control of the government. Therefore, he actively encouraged the top executive of his union – the Antigua Trades and Labour Union – to run for legislative office. He agitated for a change in the qualification of candidates for the parliamentary elections since up to that time, only property owners could run for election.

Bird won a seat to parliament in the late 1940s and his party went on to dominate electoral politics in Antigua and Barbuda for several years. He was eventually to lead the islands into political independence from Britain. Bird left his mark on the labour movement, education and the Caribbean integration movement. One of Bird&#x27;s dreams was a Caribbean that was united politically and economically. Bird ardently supported the West Indies Federation and when that collapsed in 1962, negotiated hard for a federation of the &quot;Little Eight&quot; countries.

In 1965, together with premiers Errol Barrow of Barbados and Forbes Burnham of Guyana, Bird brought the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA) into being. That Association later led to the Caribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom), comprising 12 of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, two more than were members of the West Indies Federation. 

On 1 November 1981, he became the first Prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. Since then, in a rare case in modern-day Caribbean politics, he led his party to an election victory in 1984 in which the Antigua Labour Party (ALP) won all the Antiguan seats in the Legislature.

==Awards==
In 1994, Bird was made a Knight of the Order of the National Hero (KNH) by his native country Antigua and Barbuda.

==Death==
Bird died in St. John&#x27;s at 6:58pm on 28 June 1999, aged 88.

<doc id="395105" wikidata="Q1017348" url="?curid=395105" title="Ta' Xbiex">
<text>Ta&#x27; Xbiex () is a locality and Local Council in the Eastern Region of Malta with a population of 2,148 (estimated 2019). It is part of a small headland within the Marsamxett Harbour, right between the villages of Msida and Gżira.

== Etymology ==
The name Ta&#x27; Xbiex is said to have originated from it exact geographical location as it faces the rising sun. The Maltese word &#x27;&quot;Tbexbex&#x27;&quot; is descriptive of the sun as it rises. Others say the name might originate from word &quot;&#x27;Xbiek&quot;&#x27; meaning fishing nets as would seem appropriate from its inhabitants being able to sail and fish freely from its shores. Indeed, its coat of arms depicts a ship&#x27;s wheel, further confirming its connection with the sea.

== Important Buildings ==
Many of the beautiful houses in Ta’ Xbiex house a number of foreign embassies. The Whitehall Mansions has a prestigious address, and an example of unique Maltese architecture. The building presently houses, amongst others, embassies of Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Austria, Ireland, and the British High Commission. In the 1950s it was known as The Wrennery being the residential quarters of the Woman&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS).

There are also a number of service providers such as insurance companies, law firms, auditing and accounting firms.

Among the original villas situated in the streets opposite the sea, one finds Villa Oxania, which belonged to the noted physician and leading archaeologist, Sir Temi Zammit (1864-1935), and Villa Cloe, home to Sir Arturo Mercieca (1878-1969), long-time president of the Maltese Courts and a well known political leader. Both patriots died while they held residence at Ta&#x27; Xbiex.

=== St. John of the Cross Church ===
This church became a parish in 1969 and is run by the Carmelite Monks. Decorated in the Basilical and Roman style, it is known for its quite unique Crucifix which is 420 cm high and 240 cm wide. Put in place in 1971 this large steel Crucifix is based on a drawing by St. John of the Cross and may be the largest reproduction of its kind and the only silhouette cross in the world.

== Yachting ==

For many years in the 1950s various battleships were berthed in the Msida/Ta&#x27; Xbiex creek. From the 1960s right up until today, Ta&#x27; Xbiex hosts many private boats with people from all nationalities making this location their berthing home for short as well as long stays.

The Royal Malta Yacht Club, sits proudly on the Ta&#x27; Xbiex seafront and plays host to the very popular Rolex Middle Sea Race. Tracing its origins back to the 1800s, this yachting club now enjoys well equipped premises and facilities on a site it renovated in 2008. It also houses a 65 berth Yacht Marina in the same location.

Ta&#x27; Xbiex is also home to a 720 berth Msida and Ta&#x27; Xbiex Yacht Marina. Due to its stratic location, the marina is sought-after for its central location and the shelter afforded from the prevailing North-Westerly winds, while the breakwater protects against a North-Easterly swell.

Several marine services providers are also found in the area. There are a number of restaurants along the coast that take advantage of the location, catering for the yachting community whilst also offering spectacular harbour views of the Bastions in Valletta and Floriana.

== Sport ==
Ta&#x27; Xbiex forms part of a sea-side promenada that runs from Pieta all the way to St Julians. It is a very popular route for runners who enjoy a backdrop of historical bastions, seaviews as well as busy city bustle as they move into Gzira, Sliema and St Julians.

== Local Council ==
The Ta&#x27; Xbiex Local Council is formed by the following:

Mayor: Max Zammit

Deputy Mayor: Oriana Calleja

Councillors:  Louise Cachia Castelletti

                      Eugenio Muscat

                      Rosario Portelli

Executive Secretary: Yasmine Tonna

<text>The Nida is a river in central Poland, a left tributary of the Vistula river, into which it flows near Nowy Korczyn). The Nida has a length of 154 kilometres and a basin area of 3,844 km2. This includes the protected area called Nida Landscape Park.

The Nida itself is made up of two smaller rivers, the White Nida and the Black Nida, which merge in the village of Brzegi (near Checiny). It is a typical lowland river, with little difference in the water level. The valley of the Nida is wide, and covered with meadows. At its narrowest, the river is only 6 m wide, while at its widest spot, the Nida is 79 m across. The depth ranges from 0,4 to 2,6 m. The Nida is one of the warmest rivers of Poland; in the summer, its temperature reaches up to 27 degrees C.

== Nida River Valley ==
The Nida Valley is a geographic region in southern Poland, along the lower and middle Nida. It is 65 kilometres long and 2 - 6 kilometres wide. The bottom of the valley is flat and wet, with peat appearing in several locations in the former oxbow lakes. The valley is marked by numerous meadows and pastures, and its main urban centers are ancient Lesser Poland towns of Pinczow, Wislica and Nowy Korczyn.

== Ponidzie ==
The name Ponidzie refers to a region of Lesser Poland, which lies along the Nida, and which is much larger than the valley. It stretches from Checiny to Nowy Korczyn, with three landscape parks: Nida Landscape Park, Szaniec Landscape Park and Kozubow Landscape Park. Furthermore, there are several nature reserves, such as Przeslin, Skorocice, Krzyzanowice, Skotniki Gorne, Winiary Zagojskie, Gory Wschodnie, Grabowiec and Skowronno. In the north, the region is marked by gypsum rocks, while in the south the landscape is flat. The region has two symbols, the Adonis vernalis, and the Gothic collegiate church in Wiślica.

Ponidzie, which lies halfway between the historic centers of Lesser Poland, Kraków and Sandomierz, was, in the late Middle Ages, one of the most important regions of the Kingdom of Poland. Divided between Kraków Voivodeship and Sandomierz Voivodeship, it had several castles, and many significant events took place here, in the once-important local towns of Chęciny, Nowy Korczyn, Pińczów, Wiślica, Jędrzejów, Pacanów, Szydłów, Opatowiec, Chmielnik, and Stopnica. Destroyed and ransacked during the Swedish invasion of Poland, the region has never regained its greatness.

In the 16th century, Ponidzie was one of Lesser Poland’s centres of Protestant Reformation, here Polish Brethren prayer houses and schools operated, with the most famous, the Racovian Academy. Among Protestant activists who worked here are such names, as Jan Łaski, Samuel Przypkowski, and Marcin Ruar. Furthermore, Jan Chryzostom Pasek lived here for many years. Wojciech Belon dedicated one of his songs to Ponidzie, and one of the most popular tourist attractions of the region is a narrow gauge railway “Ciuchcia Express Ponidzie”.

<doc id="395119" wikidata="Q855749" url="?curid=395119" title="Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange">
<text>Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange (; Catharina-Amalia Beatrix Carmen Victoria; born 7 December 2003) is the heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which consists of the constituent countries of Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands, and Sint Maarten.

Catharina-Amalia is the eldest child of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima. She has two younger sisters, Princess Alexia and Princess Ariane. She became heir apparent when her father ascended the throne on 30 April 2013.

==Early life==
Princess Catharina-Amalia Beatrix Carmen Victoria of the Netherlands was born at 17:01 CET on 7 December 2003 in the HMC Bronovo in The Hague, the first child of the then Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange (now king) and Princess Máxima. Upon the public announcement of her birth, 101 salute shots were fired at four places in the Kingdom of the Netherlands: Den Helder and The Hague in the Netherlands, Willemstad in Curaçao, and Oranjestad in Aruba.

On 12 June 2004, Catharina-Amalia was baptised by the Rev. Carel ter Linden in the Great Church in The Hague. Her godparents are her uncle Prince Constantijn, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, the (then) vice-president of the Council of State of the Netherlands Herman Tjeenk Willink, her mother&#x27;s friend Samantha Deane, her uncle Martín Zorreguieta, and her father&#x27;s friend Marc ter Haar. Catharina-Amalia&#x27;s maternal grandparents, Jorge Zorreguieta and María del Carmen Cerruti, were prohibited from attending her parents&#x27; wedding in 2002 due to Zorreguieta&#x27;s involvement in the regime of General Jorge Rafael Videla, but were present at her baptism, which was a private rather than a state affair.

Princess Catharina-Amalia has two younger sisters: Princess Alexia (born in 2005) and Princess Ariane (born in 2007). The family spent the princesses&#x27; formative years at Villa Eikenhorst on the De Horsten estate in Wassenaar. In 2019 they moved to Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague.

Her birthdays are traditionally celebrated with a concert at the Kloosterkerk in The Hague, which is attended by ambassadors and members of the royal household and the Council of State of the Netherlands. Catharina-Amalia&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Queen Beatrix, abdicated on 30April 2013 and her father ascended the throne. Catharina-Amalia, as the new heir apparent, assumed the title of Princess of Orange, becoming the first to do so in her own right.

== Education==
In December 2007, Catharina-Amalia started attending Bloemcamp Primary School, a public primary school in Wassenaar. After graduating from primary school, she attended the Christelijk Gymnasium Sorghvliet in The Hague, where her aunt Princess Laurentien attended. She participated in the student council and attended both the Model United Nations of the International School of The Hague and The Hague International Model United Nations conferences. She graduated in 2021 with distinction. After completing her studies at Sorghvliet, Catharina-Amalia took a gap year, during which she interned at the Orange Fund and volunteered at other organisations.

As of 5 September 2022 Catharina-Amalia is studying at the University of Amsterdam for a Bachelor of Science degree in Politics, Psychology, Law and Economics (PPLE). During her second month in university, she was moved back to the royal palace from her student housing in Amsterdam due to security risks. In April 2024, King Willem-Alexander revealed that Catharina-Amalia lived in Madrid in 2023 under the protection of the Spanish monarchy, while she continued her studies online, due to the threats from the Moroccan mafia, a criminal organization dedicated to drug trafficking that has been threatening to kidnap her. In August 2024, the Dutch Broadcasting Foundation announced that Catharina-Amalia joined Amsterdam corps, a Dutch student association. 

Catharina-Amalia speaks Dutch, English, and Spanish. Additionally, she took classes in Mandarin Chinese.

==Public life==
Catharina-Amalia and her sisters attended the annual Koningsdag. On 19 June 2010, Catharina-Amalia served as a bridesmaid at the wedding of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling. On the occasion of her 18th birthday in 2021, a biography of Catharina-Amalia was published. Similar books were published on the 18th birthday of Princess Beatrix in 1956 and Prince Willem-Alexander in 1985. The book titled &quot;Amalia&quot; is written by Dutch entertainer Claudia de Breij. On 8 December 2021, Catharina-Amalia assumed her seat in the Advisory Division of the Council of State when she reached the age of majority at 18 the day before. On the same day, she gave her first public speech at the Council of State meeting in Kneuterdijk Palace. An outdoor birthday party thrown by her family to mark the occasion was found to be in breach of regulations and restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which made her father admit that &quot;it was not right to organize this&quot;.

On 17 June 2022, together with her parents, she was among the royal guests invited to the celebrations of the 18th birthday of Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway. This was Catharina-Amalia&#x27;s first public engagement outside of The Netherlands and the first occasion to which she was allowed to wear a tiara. On 20 September 2022, together with her parents, Catharina-Amalia attended Prinsjesdag, where the King addressed a joint session of the States General of the Netherlands to outline government policy for the upcoming parliamentary session. In November 2022, Catharina-Amalia and her family visited an exhibition at Nieuwe Kerk dedicated to Queen Juliana. In December 2022, she visited the three branches of Dutch military: Air Force, Army and Navy.

In January and February 2023, Catharina-Amalia went on a tour of the Dutch Caribbean with her parents. They visited Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba. It was her first official royal tour. In April 2023, Catharina-Amalia and her sister Princess Ariane attended King&#x27;s Day concert in Rotterdam. On 5 May 2023, she accompanied her grandmother to a reception held at Buckingham Palace the evening before the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla of the United Kingdom. In June 2023, she and her parents attended a state banquet honoring the wedding of Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan and Rajwa Al Saif. She carried her first solo official trip abroad in October 2023 by attending Prince Christian of Denmark&#x27;s 18th birthday celebration banquet at Christiansborg Palace, Denmark. Catharina-Amalia attended her first state banquet, honouring King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain, in April 2024. 

=== Public image ===
Catharina-Amalia has experienced repeated fat shaming by tabloids and on social media since she was young, most notably by the Portuguese celebrity magazine &quot;Caras&quot; labeling her as plus size. In response to the body shaming, members of the public have expressed their support for the princess, calling the fat shaming against her unacceptable.

=== Annual allowance ===
Catharina-Amalia became entitled to an annual allowance from the Dutch state upon reaching the age of 18. This allowance consisted of two parts: a personal income component of €296,000 and a €1,338,000 allocation for staff and operational expenses. Following her high school graduation, Catharina-Amalia opted to decline the annual allowance until she completed her studies. 

In May 2024, citing changed circumstances, Catharina-Amalia announced she would begin utilizing her annual allowance for staff and operational expenses, starting in January 2025. This decision comes despite her ongoing studies. Her annual allowance for staff and operational expenses has continued to increase in recent years and amounted to €1.5 million in 2024.

<text>The Biebrza (, &#x27;,&#x27;) is a river in northeastern Poland, a tributary of the Narew River (near Wizna), with a length of and a basin area of 7,092 km2 (7,067 in Poland).

Larger towns in the area:
* Lipsk
* Sztabin
* Goniądz
* Osowiec-Twierdza
* Radzilow
* Wizna

The region is usually divided into lower, central, and upper basin areas, each with its own different characteristics.

==Tributaries==

* Right tributaries: Netta, Lega, Ełk, Wissa
* Left tributaries: Sidra, Brzozówka

==Natural environment==

Today, the river is best known for the vivid wildlife in the peatbogs and marshes in its flood areas.

==History==

Historically, the borderland regions of Mazovia and Lithuania, the area retains much of its cultural diversity today.

==Cultural and linguistic environment==

The basin of the Biebrza River is inhabited not only by hundreds of rare and endangered sorts of birds, but also by people representing diverse cultures, languages, and religions. Although most of the population of the region speaks standard Polish, some people in the upper river basin (municipalities of Lipsk, Dąbrowa Białostocka and partly Sztabin) speak a local dialect of Belarusian (called by them &quot;prosty jazyk&quot; &#x27;simple language&#x27;). The people there belong to the Orthodox or Roman Catholic church. On the north bank of the upper Biebrza there are also a few villages where so-called &quot;old believers&quot; live, who speak an archaic dialect of Russian. Some of these communities have preserved much of their traditional culture in spite of long-lasting communist government policies aimed at assimilation of non-Polish cultural and linguistic minorities.

<doc id="395125" wikidata="Q989796" url="?curid=395125" title="Obra (river)">
<text>Obra is a river in west Poland, a left tributary of the Warta river (in Skwierzyna), with a length of 171 kilometres and a basin area of 2,760 km2. The river is popular with canoe and kayak enthusiasts and an established canoe trail exists.

==Course==
The river source is near Jarocin, the mouth into the Warta River in the town of Skwierzyna. The Obra flows through several other towns like Krzywin, Kościan, Zbaszyn, Trzciel, Miedzyrzecz, Bledzew and Skwierzyna. The river also flows through several lakes.
==Canoeing==
The Obra is a popular river for canoeing and kayaking. The canoe trips usually begin from Zbaszyn. From there, the river passes through wilderness areas and well as the countryside. The canoe trip is not particularly difficult, with the exception of a few tricky places where fallen trees might pose a disruption. The Obra is widely regarded as a safe river for beginners.

==Flora and fauna==
The Obra River is a rich habitat for flora and fauna. Several species of orchids grow here. Sundews, mud sedge, club-mosses, Daphne, and Turk&#x27;s cap lily, together with more than 200 species of mosses and an equally large number of fungi grow in the area around Obra. Stretches of oak, beech and Scots pine grow along the river.

The Obra is also an important habitat for birds. There are over 150 species inhabiting the area. Some of the important birds found here are the sea eagle, osprey, golden eagle, common merganser, eagle owl, black stork, black woodpecker, and corn crake. Swamp turtles also live in Obra&#x27;s waters. Over 40 species of mammals roam the area around the Obra, including beaver, river otter, deer, badgers, hare, and wild boar. Fish species found in Obra include catfish, river trout, grayling, lake trout, powan, barbel, and salmon.

==The monster==
There is a local lore connected with the Obra river. The lore is centered near the northern part of the river, close to Bledzewand. There is a story of the existence of a giant fish in Lake Czapliniec. The fish is widely believed to be an old fish that has grown to a gigantic size. Others refer to it as a monster. Tales of the fish eating ducks, swans and even small dogs abound.

<doc id="395130" wikidata="Q4329756" url="?curid=395130" title="Education in Slovakia">
<text>Education in [[Slovakia]] consists of a free education system based on 10 years of compulsory school maintenance.

== General characteristics==
Most schools, especially universities, are owned by the state, though since the 1990s there are also church-owned and private schools (see Statistics section).

Slovakia has 10 years of compulsory education.

Students go to school five days a week, from Monday until Friday. Saturdays as school days were cancelled before the 1980s. Summer break is from the 1st of July until the 1st of September (at universities also in June). Other breaks occur a week or two around Christmas and Easter, in spring, autumn and on official holidays.

A school year consists of two semesters. The first one ends at the end of January in all schools, the second one before the beginning of the summer holidays. Primary and secondary school students usually have around 6 classes a day (less at the beginning of the education, more later). Classes last for 45 minutes, and there (several short ones and one longer one – the so-called &quot;big break&quot; (or by the students often just &quot;big one&quot;)). The state financed education and all textbooks and instructional material below the university level are free (returned at the end of the semester) – in most cases at least. However, there are also private schools which are paid.

Students at standard schools receive marks in almost all subjects. The marks go from 1 (best) to 5 (worst), and may include unofficial intermediary marks (such as to assess a single project, test, etc. but never on student&#x27;s final reports). Compared to western European countries, there is an intrinsic &quot;tradition&quot; of teachers granting students rather more marks at the &quot;good&quot; end of the scale, i.e. more 1s, 2s and 3s than they would receive in western Europe, for example. Students below the university level receive school reports (lists of final marks) at the end of each semester.

== History ==
&quot;See: Education in Czechoslovakia and List of colleges and universities in Slovakia&quot;

== System ==
===Primary education===
Primary schools are usually preceded by kindergartens where children can spend up to 4 years, which in turn can be preceded by day nurseries.

Generally, children start primary school in the year in which they reach 6 years of age. Standard primary schools last 9 years (8 before approx. the mid-1990s), however since the early 1990s students can visit an &quot;8-year&quot; gymnasium, where they can start attending after just 5 years (4 prior to the school year of 2009/2010) of primary school.

The primary education system is formally divided in two &quot;stages&quot;. The second stage is characterized by many changes in the subjects treated as compared to the first stage:
*first primary education stage- age 6 to 10, works as platform for next studies
*second primary education stage- age 10 to 15, this &quot;stage&quot; can be spent either in a 9-year primary school or in an 8-year gymnasium.

Many primary schools have been closed down since about 2000 due to unfavourable demographic development.

Subjects at the second primary education stage (many of them are taught even earlier however) include:
*Slovak language and literature (includes Slovak and world literature and Slovak grammar; Slovak is to be replaced with Hungarian or Ukrainian in minority schools; usually one class every day), 
*foreign language(s) (usually two,English and students can choose between German, French, Russian or Spanish, depending on the school, not every school has all 4. Before 1990 Russian was compulsory with 4 classes a week) Usually 3-5 classes per week of the main language (usually English) and 2 classes per week of the other language,
*mathematics (incl. geometry; one class every day),
*geography (political and physical alike, usually 2 classes a week), 
*biology (incl. botany, animal biology, human biology, geology and environmental studies; usually 2 classes a week), 
*chemistry (usually 2 classes a week), 
*physics (usually 2 classes a week), 
*history (usually 2 classes a week), 
*religion or ethics (students may choose between one or the other, usually 1 class a week),
*physical education (usually 2 classes a week),
*musical education (usually 1 class a week; sometimes skipped altogether due to lack of equipment, funds, teachers),
*artistic education (usually 1 class a week, sometimes skipped altogether due to lack of equipment, funds, teachers),
*technical education (usually 1 class a week, sometimes skipped altogether due to lack of equipment, funds, teachers)

There are also many facultative &quot;primary art schools&quot; — afternoon schools for particular music instruments, theatre, painting, etc. These have had a long tradition in Slovakia and are attended by a large portion of pupils.

=== Secondary education===

Before entering any school of secondary education (including 8-year gymnasium) for which there are more applicants than places offered, the applicants have to pass entrance examinations.

Secondary schools usually last for 4 years (from the age of 16 to the age of 19). A gymnasium can also last up to 8 years (up to the age of 18) depending on how many years the student spent in primary school.

There are four types of secondary schools:
* general education (non-vocational):
**&quot;gymnázium&quot; (i.e. gymnasium, also translated as grammar school or high school) – 4, 5 (for bilingual gymnasiums) 8 years, i.e. age 16 to 19 or age 10 to 18; prepares students for higher education; teaches at least 2 foreign languages
* various vocational schools (visited by students interested in arts, crafts or any special skills):
**&quot;stredná odborná škola&quot;(secondary professional school) – usually age 16 to 19; usually also prepares for higher education
**&quot;stredné odborné učilište&quot; (secondary vocational school) – usually age 16 to 19; training center
**&quot;združená stredná škola&quot; (&#x27;grouped&#x27; secondary school) – usually age 16 to 19; rare

The gymnasia (high schools) are usually considered &quot;prestigious&quot; schools, because they explicitly prepare for higher education and because they are often highly selective - only the brightest students from elementary schools may be accepted. In fact, most students who attend them later continue their education at a school of higher education in Slovakia or abroad. The high schools that are the most competitive are usually located either in Bratislava (Gamča, Gymnázium Metodova, Gymnázium Jura Hronca, ŠPMNDAG A school for the exceptionally talented children), in Košice (Gymnázium Poštová etc.), and a boarding gymnasium in the city of Sučany Bilingválne Gymnázium Milana Hodžu often abbreviated to GBAS - meaning Gymnasium Bilingual English-Slovak. Of the latter GBAS is considered the most prestigious in the central region, Poštová in the eastern region, and Gymnázium Jura Hronca as well as GAMČA in the western region where the capital, Bratislava, is located. These schools annually accept only a very low percentage of applicants often below 15% or 10%, and tend to accept a large proportion of commuting or boarding students subject to tradition. Despite providing general education, many gymnasia have specialized classes . Some of them specialize in languages or are even &quot;bilingual&quot; Slovak-German/English/French etc. (e.g. Gymnázium Milana Hodžu, Gymnázium Metodova, Gymnázium Jura Hronca), others are specialized in mathematics or computer programming, for example Gamča and Gymnázium Jura Hronca. Gamča is notable for being founded in 1626 which is exactly 113 years after the gymnasium in Levoča was founded in 1513. On the other hand, GBAS is noted for being established only in 1993 through a close cooperation of the Slovak Ministry of Education with the British Council of Slovakia holding the name of a respected Slovak statesman Milan Hodža. The 1st Slovak debate club was established at GBAS, and noted educationalists argue Gymnázium Jura Hronca and GBAS started a wave of sending the most talented students to the most selective of English. French and American high schools (such as Eton group, ESAO, UWC ...) as well as universities (including Harvard University, Oxford University, Cambridge University. Imperial College London, LSE. Sciences Po Paris campus, Princeton University, Bocconi University in Milan and others).

After finishing secondary school students usually take a school-leaving exam (matura in German, &quot;maturita&quot; in Slovak), which is a basic prerequisite for visiting a school of higher education (college), especially a university. Before 1990 this included obligatory exams in mathematics (written nationwide standardized + oral), Slovak incl. literature (written nationwide standardized + oral) and Russian and in one subject of the students&#x27;s choice. After 1990, the system was changed, so that every school prepared its own tests and questions – at gymnasia in the subjects: Slovak incl. literature (written and oral), a foreign language (written and oral), two subjects of the student&#x27;s choice (oral). The obvious problem of this system was low or missing comparability of the results. The maturita system was modified in 2005 again. The new system is supposed to replace the current entrance examinations to schools of higher education (colleges) in the future. The main changes are: one additional exam subject (for gymnasia), nationwide unified written tests for languages and mathematics (other subjects are supposed to follow in the future), a high degree of standardization of other exams, as well as the possibility for the student to choose whether they want to pass an A-level exam (the simplest one), a B-level exam or a C-level exam (the most difficult one, only for languages). At gymnasia, the exam subjects include: Slovak incl. literature (written and oral), a foreign language (written and oral), a natural science subject, and two other subjects of the student&#x27;s choice [Details in Slovak: ]

===Higher education===

The Slovak term &quot;vysoká škola&quot; (&quot;school of higher education&quot;, literally &quot;high school&quot;, compare the German name Hochschule), which for lack of other expressions is also translated into English as &quot;college&quot;, can refer to all schools of higher (i.e. tertiary) education, or in a narrower sense only to those schools of higher education that are not universities.

The first university on the territory of Slovakia was the Universitas Istropolitana (=Academia Istropolitana) founded in 1465. The main and largest current university in Slovakia is the Comenius University. For other current universities and colleges see List of colleges and universities in Slovakia.

The 2002 Act on Schools of Higher Education dinstinguishes public, state, and private schools of higher education (colleges):
*Public schools of higher education are the basic case. They are established by law. The vast majority of schools of higher education is of this type. They are financed by the government and possible business activities. 
*State institutions of higher education are all military, police and medical schools. They are established through the corresponding ministries of the government. They are financed by the government and possible business activities.
*Private institutions of higher education are established and financed by non-government institutions, but approved by the Ministry of Education. This type of school is still quite rare.

Studies at the state and public universities is available free of charge when studying in Slovak language. When studying in English programs in Slovakia, students have to pay from US$2,300 to US$13,500 for one academic year depending on the program. The lowest tuition fee is for management (2,000 EUR/year) and the highest is for dentistry (13,500 EUR/year).. Furthermore, the foreign high school diploma should be officially recognized through the nostrification process in Slovakia. This involves submitting the diploma, academic transcripts, and an official Slovak translation to the relevant education authorities. The process ensures that the foreign qualification meets Slovak standards. In some cases, an additional exam may be required to confirm equivalency. Once completed, nostrification allows students to enroll in Slovak universities and pursue their studies without any barriers, making it a key step for international applicants.
Before entering any school of higher education for which there are more applicants than places offered, the applicants have to pass entrance examinations. These examinations take very different forms at particular schools. The &quot;maturita&quot; results of the applicant are usually also taken into account when evaluating whether he can become student of the school. Since the number of branches of study and of schools of higher education increased considerably in the course of the late 18th century (although at the cost of quality of the studies), the general percentage of those not being accepted to these schools decreased considerably over the same time period. Also, an increasing number of Slovaks studies abroad, especially in the Czech Republic due to a low language barrier, a slightly better economic situation (and job perspectives) in that country, as well as similarities of the two educational systems. As a result, the percentage of Slovaks with higher education has increased considerably over the last decade.

The studies are organized within the following study programmes and &quot;stages&quot; (also translated as levels). Each school must provide at least Stage 1:
*Stage 1: Bachelor study programme; 3–4 years; title: &quot;Bachelor&quot; (bakalár, abbr. &quot;Bc.&quot;)
*Stage 2, or Stage 1 + Stage 2 (Stage 2 lasts 1–3 years):
**Master&#x27;s study programme; title: &quot;Master&quot; (magister, abbr. &quot;Mgr.&quot;) [in art studies: Master of Arts (magister umenia, abbr. &quot;Mgr. art.&quot;)];
** Engineer study programme; title: &quot;Engineer&quot; (inžinier, abbr. &quot;Ing.&quot;) [in architecture &quot;Engineer of Architecture&quot; (inžinier architekt, abbr. &quot;Ing. arch.&quot;)]
** Doctor study programme ; titles: 
***a) in human medicine: &quot;Doctor of Medicine&quot; (doktor medicíny, abbr. &quot;MUDr.&quot;)
***b) in veterinary medicine: &quot;Doctor of Veterinary Medicine&quot; (doktor veterinárnej medicíny, abbr. &quot;MVDr.&quot;)
***c) in dental medicine: &quot;Doctor of Denatal Medicine&quot; (doktor zubného lekárstva, abbr. &quot;MDDr.&quot;), studying since 2010
*Stage 2/3: 
**Doctor after writing a rigorous thesis and passing a viva voce and rigorous exam are:
***a) in natural science &quot;Doctor of Natural Sciences&quot; (doktor prírodných vied, abbr. &quot;RNDr.&quot;),
***b) in pharmacy &quot;Doctor of Pharmacy&quot; (doktor farmácie, abbr. &quot;PharmDr.&quot;),
***c) in social sciences and art sciences &quot;Doctor of Philosophy&quot; (doktor filozofie, abbr. &quot;PhDr.&quot;),
***d) in law studies &quot;Doctor of Laws&quot; (doktor práv, abbr. &quot;JUDr.&quot;),
***e) in teaching and PE studies &quot;Doctor of Pedagogy&quot; (doktor pedagogiky, abbr. &quot;PaedDr.&quot;),
***f) in theology (except for Catholic theology) &quot;Doctor of Theology&quot; (doktor teológie, abbr. &quot;ThDr.&quot;).
*Stage 3: 
**Doctor and study programme; 3–4 years; titles (placed behind the name):
***a) basic title &quot;Philosophiae Doctor&quot; (doktor, abbr. &quot;PhD.&quot;)
***b) in art studies &quot;Doctor Artis&quot; (doktor umenia, abbr. &quot;ArtD.&quot;)
***c) in Catholic theology &quot;Licentiate of Theology&quot; (licenciát teológie, abbr.&quot;ThLic.&quot;) or &quot;Doctor of Theology&quot; (doktor teológie, abbr. &quot;ThDr.&quot;)
**specialisation studies in medicine

The Act on Schools of Higher Education 2002 dinstinguishes:
*university-type schools of higher education: They provide study programmes at all three stages and with a considerable proportion of the 2nd and 3rd stage. Only these schools are allowed to use the word &quot;university&quot; in their name.
*non-university-type schools of higher education = professional schools of higher education: These are the remaining schools (providing predominantly the first stage only)

The academic year begins on 1 September of the current year and ends on 31 August of the next year (in reality, however it ends in May/June). The studies in one academic year may be divided into two semesters or rarely in three trimesters. The teaching process includes various forms of instruction such as lectures, seminars, exercises, laboratory work, projects, practical training, consultations, etc. The credit system following the rules of the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) has been introduced in 1998 for the organisation of all levels and forms of higher education study. The student&#x27;s standard load is expressed by the number of sixty credits per academic year and thirty credits per semester. The school of higher education determines the total number of credits required for due completion of the study in its respective stages.

Students who live further away from their university may apply for a dorm, however private housing is increasingly popular among students despite its higher cost. Dormitories and schools provide a canteen with very low prices for students. All study materials must be obtained by students. Students receive a wide range of discounts and the state pays their health insurance and for social security payments. Students of both public and private universities can enjoy the listed benefits if they are younger than 26 year old and are student of a daily program. The current setup of universities in Slovakia makes it possible for even the poorest to attend if they can afford the first fees for application, the first payment for a dormitory, and the first purchase of study materials.

Universities offer external study program as an alternative to the daily program. The external study is longer by 1 year for both Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s courses and students of external study aren&#x27;t eligible for state benefits. The major difference between external study and a daily study program is the number of courses and the scheduling modified to favor employed people. The final exams for both daily and external program students are the same.

Among the most desired by employers are STEM degrees with primacy held by degrees in IT, preferably from Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava and engineering degrees. Other desirable degrees for employees are from economics, mostly from University of Economics in Bratislava.

<doc id="395136" wikidata="Q1107156" url="?curid=395136" title="State defense force">
<text>In the United States, state defense forces (SDFs) are military units that operate under the sole authority of a state government. State defense forces are authorized by state and federal law and are under the command of the governor of each state.

State defense forces are distinct from their state&#x27;s National Guard in that they cannot become federal entities. All state National Guard personnel (to include the National Guard of the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of Guam and the Virgin Islands) can be federalized under the National Defense Act Amendments of 1933 with the creation of the National Guard of the United States. This provides the basis for integrating units and personnel of the Army National Guard into the U.S. Army and, since 1947, units and personnel of the Air National Guard into the U.S. Air Force.

The federal government recognizes state defense forces, as per the Compact Clause of the U.S. Constitution, under which provides that state defense forces as a whole may not be called, ordered, or drafted into the armed forces of the United States, thus preserving their separation from the National Guard. However, under the same law, individual members serving in the state defense force are not exempt from service in the armed forces (i.e., they are not excluded from the draft). Under 32 USC § 109(e), &quot;A person may not become a member of a defense force ... if he is a member of a reserve component of the armed forces.&quot;

Nearly every state has laws authorizing state defense forces, and 19 states, plus the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, have active forces with different levels of activity, support, and strength. State defense forces generally operate with emergency management and homeland security missions. Most SDFs are organized as ground units, but air and naval units also exist. Depending on the state, they may be variously named as &quot;state military&quot;, &quot;state military force&quot;, &quot;state guard&quot;, &quot;state militia&quot;, or &quot;state military reserve&quot;.

Every state defense force is also the command authority for the &quot;unorganized militia&quot;, which is defined as every able bodied male between the age of 17 and 45 who is not already serving in some capacity within the armed forces or National Guard. The original concept of the unorganized militia being a citizen army which could be raised immediately in times of extreme national emergency. In the modern day military, the unorganized militia is considered obsolete with very few exceptions. One of the only recognized instances where unorganized militia members wear uniforms and actively perform military duties is the Virginia Militia which actively employs officers amongst the various military schools in the state of Virginia.

==History==
===Origins===
From its founding until the early 1900s, the United States maintained only a minimal army and relied on state militias to supply the majority of its troops, with the training and readiness of the latter varying widely. As a result of the Spanish–American War and the performance of the militias and other volunteer units during that conflict, Congress was called upon to reform and regulate the training and qualification of state militias. In 1903, with passage of the Militia Act of 1903, the predecessor to the modern-day National Guard was formed. It required the states to divide their militias into two sections. The law recommended the title &quot;National Guard&quot; for the first section, for federal administration, and &quot;Reserve Militia&quot; for the individual states.

===World War I===
During World War I, Congress authorized the states to maintain Home Guards, which were reserve forces outside the National Guard forces that were then being deployed by the Federal Government as part of the National Army. The Secretary of War was authorized to furnish these Home Guard units with rifles, ammunition, and supplies.

===Interwar years===
In 1933, Congress finalized the split between the National Guard and the traditional state militias by mandating that all federally funded soldiers take a dual enlistment/commission and thus enter both the state National Guard and the newly created National Guard of the United States, a federal reserve force.

===World War II===
In 1940, with the onset of World War II and as a result of its federalizing the National Guard, Congress amended the National Defense Act of 1916, and authorized the states to maintain &quot;military forces other than National Guard.&quot;

===Cold War===
In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War and at the urging of the National Guard, Congress reauthorized the separate state military forces for a time period of two years. These state military forces were authorized military training at federal expense, as well as &quot;arms, ammunition, clothing, and equipment,&quot; as deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Army. At the end of the two years, however, they were not reauthorized under federal law.

In 1956, Congress finally revised the law and authorized &quot;state defense forces&quot; permanently under Title 32, Section 109, of the United States Code. Two years later, Congress amended the law and changed the name from &quot;State defense forces&quot; to &quot;defense forces.&quot; Still, it was not until the early Ronald Reagan administration that many states developed their defense forces into elements that existed beyond paper, when the U.S. Department of Defense actively encouraged states to create and maintain SDF units.

By the late 1980s, however, a series of high-profile reports caused several states to shut down or significantly restructure their forces. In 1987, the governor of Utah removed all but 31 officers from the Utah State Guard, after a probe revealed that its ranks were &quot;peppered with neo-Nazis, felons and mental patients.&quot; Meanwhile, in 1990, the Virginia General Assembly launched an investigation and subsequent overhaul of its state&#x27;s force after receiving tips that the volunteers were &quot;saving money to buy a tank.&quot;

===Contemporary===

With the end of the Cold War came a general decrease of interest in state defense forces. The September 11 attacks, however, generated additional attention and, with it, greater scrutiny from some in the United States military who questioned the training and equipment of the units and whether they provided an outlet for &quot;warrior wannabes&quot; who would not otherwise qualify for service in the armed forces.

In 2008, Alaska disarmed its state defense force after an investigation concluded the lack of training intensity or standardization was a potential legal liability to the state. By 2010 the status of the force had been downgraded even further, with the Adjutant-General of the Alaska National Guard informing volunteers that they would only be called upon as a &quot;reserve of last resort to be used only in the most extreme emergencies.&quot; The ASDF remained deliberately hamstrung for several years, until Governor Bill Walker overruled the Adjutant-General in 2016 when he announced his intention to reform the Alaska State Defense Force by expanding it further into rural Alaska and improving training standards.

Further controversy was stoked by a &quot;New York Times&quot; report which found many senior officers in the New York Guard had little or no formal military training despite holding, in some cases, general officer ranks. The former commander of the force, Pierre David Lax, noted that, &quot;if you are friendly with the governor and you always wanted to be a general, you ask the governor to make you a general, and poof, you are a brigadier general.&quot; Another former commander asserted he regularly awarded titles to members of the New York legislature in exchange for their support of budgetary allocations to the force. The report also noted that a majority of the unit&#x27;s rare deployments involved providing ceremonial support, such as bands and color guards, to the state government.
An April 2014 Department of Defense report by the Inspector General&#x27;s office reported confusion and inconsistency among state adjutant generals as to the use and status of state defense forces. The Inspector General&#x27;s office reported an under-utilization of state defense force capabilities due to a lack of clarity in the US Code regarding the use of SDFs, fueling fear that using funds and assets acquired through the federal government for state defense forces could run afoul of regulations. (While the National Guard is operated by the states, most of their equipment and funding comes from the federal government.) This fear of violating regulations also inhibited their use and integration with their National Guard counterparts, preventing them from conducting joint operations alongside one another, and also from volunteering in support of federal missions. Other problems cited by the Inspector General&#x27;s office were a lack of standardization in training and physical fitness, raising questions as to the ability of SDFs to work alongside their National Guard counterparts, and a lack of coordination with and support from the Department of Defense. During a survey conducted by the Inspector General of SDF commanders and adjutant generals, 18 of 19 considered their SDFs to be part of the organized militia and subject to the Code of Military Justice, 14 of 18 considered the members of SDFs to be &quot;soldiers&quot;, 14 of 18 considered SDF personnel to be &quot;lawful belligerents&quot; under the rules of war, and only 4 of 19 authorized their personnel to conduct firearms training. Almost all of the missions reported to the IG&#x27;s office were non-military in nature, including small-scale search and rescue, disaster management, and other unarmed, homeland security related-tasks.

Due to public fears over the Jade Helm 15 exercises held throughout a number of southwestern states, on 28 April 2015, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas ordered a call-up of the Texas State Guard to monitor the exercises and facilitate communication between US special operations forces conducting training and the governor&#x27;s office.

In early 2020, a number of state defense forces were activated to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 2020, the Alaska State Defense Force, the California State Guard, the Governor&#x27;s Guards of Connecticut, the Georgia State Defense Force, the Indiana Guard Reserve, the Maryland Defense Force, the New York Guard, the Ohio Military Reserve, the South Carolina State Guard, the Tennessee State Guard, the Texas State Guard, and the Virginia Defense Force had all contributed members to their respective states&#x27; efforts in combating the pandemic.

In 2022, the Florida State Guard was restored, and throughout 2023 and 2024 created aerial, maritime, land, and special units. In 2023, Florida approved a $ 107 million budget for 2023-2024. In 2024, signifying cross-state cooperation and operations by State defense forces, the Florida State Guard sent troops to Texas to support border operations.

===Future===
A 2003 article in the United States Army War College&#x27;s &quot;Parameters&quot; journal recommended that &quot;United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) should ensure that future contingency planning efforts for homeland security operations fully incorporate the valuable capabilities that State Defense Forces can provide.&quot; In the decade following that article, however, no significant action has been taken on the recommendation.

Several bills have been unsuccessfully introduced in Congress since the early 1990s seeking to improve the readiness of state defense forces. The most recent, H.R. 206, introduced in 2009 by Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, would have allowed the U.S. Secretary of Defense to transfer surplus U.S. military equipment to state defense forces. Co-sponsors of the bill included Jim Marshall and Frank Wolf. Congress took no action on the measure before adjourning.

In recent years, state defense forces have focused on retooling their capabilities to be better prepared for future missions by improving their professionalism and interoperability with other agencies. The development of professional commands to support the National Guard, especially medical commands to buttress civil authorities during a civil crisis, has become an emerging trend.

Several state defense forces have begun to shift their focus to preparing for larger emergencies which may require multiple states to coordinate relief efforts. In July 2015, the Virginia Defense Force headed a multi-state communications exercise, the first ever of its kind, where the VDF practiced long-distance radio communications with the Tennessee State Guard, Indiana Guard Reserve, Texas State Guard, and the California State Military Reserve. Further efforts at standardizing training between state defense forces by setting competency requirements have been undertaken by the State Guard Association, which followed its Military Emergency Management Specialist training program with a JAG Academy an Engineer Specialty Qualification Badge, and plans for a Medical Academy in the future.

Individual states have made efforts to increase their capabilities to be prepared to take on future missions. In March 2017, the California State Military Reserve activated its Maritime Component to lead and assist in future homeland security missions while working in conjunction with other agencies, including the Coast Guard Auxiliary, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, CalTrans, and other civilian departments. As of May 2017, the Maryland Defense Force has significantly reorganized; the number of available officer billets has been shrunk, and the job descriptions reorganized, in order to avoid having a top-heavy organizational structure. New units, including the Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) Support Unit, have been approved, and others, such as the MDDF Cyber Unit, have planned expansions. Training standards were also heightened, with the MDDF requiring that drill participation, age, height, and weight requirements be more strictly enforced. Further, all new soldiers are currently required to earn their Military Emergency Management Specialist Badge. These changes were made with the goal that the future MDDF would be able to &quot;seamlessly integrate into missions with the National Guard.&quot;

Florida, in its effort to develop its State Guard, in 2023 it received approval to construct its headquarters and training center in Flagler County. In September 2024 it was reported that the Florida State Guard plans to build an airbase at Tallahassee International Airport, with the planned site consisting of two hangars, an office, and accompanying infrastructure. 

==List of state defense forces==
There are currently 20 active state defense forces and 5 active naval militias. The Puerto Rico State Guard includes an air support component, the 1st Air Base Group, that support the operations of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard.
* Colorado does not operate an active state defense force, but rather has a statutory state defense force staffed by one individual appointed by the governor.

==Structure==
===Personnel and training===
Some state defense forces advertise recruitment and physical standards lower than the U.S. military with relaxed waiver standards. While other state defense forces, and specific units, advertise professional military and physical fitness standards to retain integration with National Guard counterparts and more physically demanding state and interagency missions.

California, for instance, requires no physical fitness test prior to entry and has weight/height standards significantly more relaxed than the federal service for certain units, but certain jobs — like firefighters, search and rescue, and certain maritime search and rescue/dive personnel within the Cal Guard&#x27;s Emergency Response Command and Maritime Service — require passing a physical fitness test, pack hikes, and tryouts. California State Guard wildland firefighters, for example, must complete the National Wildfire Coordinating Group Red Card standards, then complete a Cal Fire interagency training program alongside their National Guard counterparts. In the Texas State Guard, there are minimal requirements for general accession, but joining specialized teams like the Dive, Rescue, and Recovery (DR&amp;R) Team requires physical fitness testing and completion of the Texas Dive School.

Officer Candidate Schools are also maintained by the active State Defense Forces of the United States by direction of their respective state military departments and by the state&#x27;s National Guard Adjutant General. Similar to their state&#x27;s National Guard counterparts who take a dual federal and state military commission, military officers who are commissioned through a SDF Officer Candidate School take a sole military commission to the state that they support, recognized by their state&#x27;s military code and . In states with full integration of state military resources (SDF and National Guard counterparts) the curriculum is often similar, with the National Guard curriculum taking on additional requirements to meet federal recognition (referred to as FEDREC). For example, California maintains both Officer Candidate Schools at Camp San Luis Obispo, with the State Guard OCS being 11–12 months and the National Guard OCS being 16–18 months, both celebrate a joint graduation.

The Military Emergency Management Specialist Badge, created by the State Guard Association of the United States, has become a common training focal point among state defense forces. Alabama, California, Indiana, Ohio and others have adopted the MEMS Badge as a basic qualification required of all members desiring promotion. Training is conducted both online, and through MEMS academies in each state, and includes course material provided by FEMA and other agencies, as well as practical experience in local disaster planning and exercise management.

Community Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) are being organized by several SDFs by utilizing training offered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency&#x27;s Citizen Corps. Some states follow the lead of the Army and offer a permanent tab (worn in a similar manner as the Army&#x27;s Ranger and Sapper tabs) as an incentive to become certified as part of the local or unit CERT team.

State defense forces may incorporate Medical Reserve Corps units into their organizational structure. The 47th Medical Company (MRC), of the New Mexico State Defense Force, the 10th Medical Regiment of the Maryland Defense Force, and the Medical Brigade of the Texas State Guard receive training and recognition from the Medical Reserve Corps program sponsored by the Office of the Surgeon General of the United States through the Citizen Corps program, and are simultaneously organized as units of their respective state defense force.

Weapons qualification and training is provided in some SDFs. However, most SDFs do not require weapons proficiency. A 2006 report by the U.S. Freedom Foundation, an organization affiliated with the State Guard Association of the United States, recommended minimum standards for state defense forces, including weapons training, but the report has been largely ignored. Some SDFs have laws that in the event of deployment by order of the state legislature and/or governor, they will become armed.

===Uniforms===

As a general rule, state defense forces wear standard U.S. military uniforms with insignia closely matching those of their federal counterparts. SDF units generally wear red name tags on service uniforms (as specifically prescribed by AR 670-1 for SDF units when adopting the Army Service Uniform or Battle Dress Uniform (BDU), and name tapes on Army Combat Uniforms (ACU) or BDUs use the state defense force name or state name rather than &quot;U.S. Army.&quot; Standard U.S. Army branch insignia are often used or a unique &quot;state guard&quot; branch insignia consisting of a crossed musket and sword is alternatively used.
Where berets are worn, some state defense forces use a beret flash similar to the one the U.S. Army uses, but in bright red thread instead of the Army&#x27;s blue. Other states have beret flashes that are often based on their state flag.

Uniforms vary from state to state and tend to have only subtle differences. For example, the Texas State Guard wears standard U.S. Army camouflage uniforms, a state guard unit patch, and the &quot;U.S. Army&quot; name tape replaced with one reading &quot;Texas State Guard.&quot; Similarly, the California State Military Reserve wears a uniform identical to their National Guard counterparts except for the unit patch, beret flash, and the &quot;California&quot; name tape. Outer garments such as a Gore-Tex jacket have a subdued &quot;CA&quot; beneath the rank insignia. A similar pattern can be found in the New York Guard. The Georgia State Defense Force often works in tandem with and support of federal troops. The Georgia State Defense Force wears the OCP pattern of the ACU with a unique Georgia SDF red flash on the U.S. Army&#x27;s black beret and &quot;Georgia&quot; in place of the &quot;U.S. Army&quot; uniform name tape. The Tennessee State Guard and Alabama State Defense Force can wear either BDUs or the &quot;tactical response uniform&quot; (TRU) in the Woodland pattern but whose cut and accouterments match the ACU but cannot mix pieces. The Alabama State Defense Force has also recently introduced a new &quot;Standard Service Uniform&quot; composed of a blue &quot;tactical&quot; shirt, and khaki &quot;tactical&quot; pants.

The few states with both SDF air and naval units wear modified USAF and USN/USMC uniforms. Currently, only Ohio, Alaska and New York have uniformed naval militias. Only California, Vermont, and Puerto Rico have an air wing, though Indiana formerly had an Air Guard Reserve. In all cases, the state adjutant general has the final say on uniforms worn by state defense forces, though federal service regulations generally shape the policies of each state.
In March 2024, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau signed an updated Chief of the National Guard Bureau Instruction (CNGBI) 5500.01A &quot;National Guard Interaction with State Defense Forces&quot;. In this new regulation, it outlined new uniform requirements of SDFs who wear modified US Army Utility Uniforms. These new requirements are the responsibilities of State Adjutant Generals to enforce on their state&#x27;s SDFs. The new regulations include: solid red background nametapes with white lettering, solid red backgrounds and white ranks for rank tabs, solid red covers with white ranks, the requirement of full color state flags, full color unit patches, and a tab on the left shoulder displaying &quot;SDF&quot; in white lettering on a solid red background. Notably, this regulation also disallowed the display of previously earned qualification badges on the utility uniforms if the badge was issued by the US Armed Forces. For example, if a state SDF member earned a parachutist badge while in the US Armed Forces, they are no longer allowed to display said badge on their SDF uniform. Federal awards not issued by the US Armed Forces are still authorized. This was largely seen by SDF groups, including the State Guard Association of the United States, as an attempt to discredit the legitimacy of SDFs; concerned it would cause confusion among civilians. Proponents argued that it was necessary to ensure there was no confusion between SDFs and the National Guard.

==Federal activation==
The U.S. Constitution, coupled with several statutes and cases, details the relationship of state defense forces to the federal government. Outside of 32 U.S.C. 109, the U.S. Supreme Court noted: &quot;It is true that the state defense forces &#x27;may not be called, ordered, or drafted into the armed forces.&#x27; 32 U.S.C. 109(c). It is nonetheless possible that they are subject to call under 10 U.S.C. 331–333, which distinguish the &#x27;militia&#x27; from the &#x27;armed forces,&#x27; and which appear to subject all portions of the &#x27;militia&#x27; – organized or not – to call if needed for the purposes specified in the Militia Clauses&quot; (&quot;Perpich&quot; v. &quot;Department of Defense&quot;, 496 U.S. 334 (1990)). The Court, however, explicitly noted that it was not deciding this issue. The following is an extract of the laws which the Court cited as possibly giving the federal government authority to activate the state defense forces:

10 U.S.C. 251 – &quot;Federal aid for State governments&quot;
&quot;Whenever there is an insurrection in any State against its government, the President may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor if the legislature cannot be convened, call into Federal service such of the militia of the other States, in the number requested by that State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to suppress the insurrection.&quot;

10 U.S.C. 252 – &quot;Use of militia and armed forces to enforce Federal authority&quot;
&quot;Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State or Territory by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of any State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.&quot;

10 U.S.C. 253 – &quot;Interference with State and Federal law&quot;
&quot;The President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy, if it -&quot;

&quot;(1) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the United States within the State, that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or&quot;

&quot;(2) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.&quot;

&quot;In any situation covered by clause (1), the State shall be considered to have denied the equal protection of the laws secured by the Constitution.&quot;

==State defense force reactivation efforts==
A number of legislators have spearheaded attempts to reactivate the state defense forces of their states. In 2011, a bill was introduced in the New Hampshire General Court which, if passed, would permanently reestablish the New Hampshire State Guard. The bill did not pass. The same year, Governor Jan Brewer signed a bill which authorized the organization of a state defense force in Arizona. 

In 2018, Kansas state senator Dennis Pyle petitioned the Governor of Kansas to reactivate the Kansas State Guard, in part to offer an additional security resource for schools.

In 2019, Pennsylvania State Representative Chris Rabb proposed legislation which would reactivate and modernize the Pennsylvania State Guard in order to &quot;address the epidemic of gun violence, domestic terrorism, and other inter-related public health crises.&quot;

In December 2021, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced plans to reestablish the Florida State Guard as a 200-person volunteer force that would act independently of the federal government in disaster relief efforts. The reactivated Florida State Guard was announced in June 2022.

In January 2022, Oklahoma State Senator Nathan Dahm introduced legislation to reactivate the Oklahoma State Guard. The bill failed in the Republican-led Oklahoma Senate Veterans Committee in February 2022.

In February 2024, Arizona State Representative Joseph Chaplik introduced Arizona House Concurrent Resolution 2059 to establish the Arizona State Guard. The Resolution notably includes granting the Arizona State Guard the authority to make arrests and enforce laws. That same month, multiple West Virginia State Delegates introduced West Virginia House Bill 5525, or the &quot;West Virginia State Guard Act&quot;. This bill would direct the governor of West Virginia to establish and maintain a State Defense Force for West Virginia. Prior to this, a West Virginia State Guard was authorized for creation by the governor, but this Act would direct the governor to create one. This bill notably includes several tax and education benefits for a service commitment.

In 2025, Governor Kevin Stitt announced his desire to reestablish the Oklahoma State Guard. The same year, Wyoming State Senator Dan Laursen introduced a bill into the Wyoming Legislature to introduce the Wyoming State Guard.

==Notable members==
* Radio host Clark Howard retired from the Georgia State Defense Force after more than 20 years of service.
* Former New York state Republican Party chairman Joseph Mondello was a member of the New York Guard.
* David P. Weber, former Assistant Inspector General of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and whistleblower, is a Lieutenant Colonel JAG officer in the Maryland Defense Force, attached to the Maryland Army National Guard.

<text>Gymnázium Jura Hronca (GJH) is a gymnasium (grammar school) in Bratislava, Slovakia.

The school focuses on the study of natural sciences, mathematics, and computer sciences. However, its affiliation with the International Baccalaureate, an active bi-lingual (English – Slovak) programme and the option to study several foreign languages such as French and German, the school has a strong reputation for the study of foreign languages.

In the school year 2005/2006, GJH launched lower programs of IB Primary Years Programme and IB Middle Years Programme.

The school has been recently known as the &quot;Spojená škola Gymnázium Jura Hronca a ZŠ Košická&quot; (United school of the Gymnázium Jura Hronca and the Košická Primary School) after a merge with the primary school &quot;Základná škola a osemročné gymnázium Košická&quot; sharing the same building.

==History==
The school was founded on January 9, 1959, as an 11-year secondary school. In the school year 1969/70 the school was granted the status of a Gymnasium, named after the Slovak mathematician Jur Hronec.

In 1997 the school donated the head of a mummified Egyptian man to the Slovak National Museum.

<text>The Poprad (, ) is a river in northern Slovakia and southern Poland, and a tributary of the Dunajec River near Stary Sącz, Poland. It has a length of 170 kilometres (63 km of which are within the Polish borders) and a basin area of 2,077 km2, (1,594 km2 of which is in Slovakia, and 483 km2 in Poland). Much of the Polish part of its basin is included in the protected area called Poprad Landscape Park featuring the Poprad River Gorge, a popular tourist destination between the towns of Piwniczna and Rytro.

Poprad is the only large Slovak river flowing north into southern Poland. The river flows through the Slovak towns of Poprad, Kežmarok, Stará Ľubovňa, then forms for 31.1 km the Polish-Slovak border and flows through the Polish towns of Krynica-Zdrój, Muszyna, Piwniczna-Zdrój, Rytro, Stary Sącz, and Żegiestów, among others.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from a Proto-Slavic verb &quot;pręd-&quot; (to flow fast, to jump), preserved in the Slovak words &quot;priasť&quot;, &quot;pradenie&quot; (to spin, spinning).

<text>The River Rea (pronounced &quot;ray&quot;) is a small river which passes through Birmingham, England. It is the river on which Birmingham was founded by the Beorma tribe in the 7th century.

==Name==
The name of the Rea derives from a root found in many Indo-European languages and means &quot;to run&quot; or &quot;to flow&quot;.

==Course==
The Rea rises in Waseley Hills Country Park, with the source well signposted from the car park there. The river drops about in its first mile, but from then on has a very gentle slope. The river&#x27;s tributaries include Callow Brook, the Bourne (which begins as Merritts Brook before joining Griffins Brook) and Bourne Brook. From Rubery, the river flows into Birmingham near the former Rover works at Longbridge, then flows through a tunnel under the A38. In Northfield, one of the river&#x27;s few remaining fords is at The Mill Walk, near Hawkesley Mill Lane. After this, the river valley is also used by the railway to Kings Norton.

Wychall Reservoir, near the river at Kings Norton, was built in the early 19th century by the Worcester Canal Company after mill owners claimed that water was being taken from the river to fill the canal and reducing the working effectiveness of their mills. Following Kings Norton, the river flows through Stirchley. It is now culverted for much of its course through Birmingham, during which it passes through the Pebble Mill area and Cannon Hill Park then Calthorpe Park. A pair of decorative arches on the bridge where Gooch Street crosses the river mark the first settlement of Birmingham. The medieval hamlet of Birmingham was built on a crossing on the Rea in what is now Digbeth. Many of the street names in the area refer to the river or its mills. These include Rea Street, Floodgate Street, River Street and Duddeston Mill Road. There are proposals to include a riverside walk and new bridge over the Rea at Digbeth&#x27;s Custard Factory media and arts complex (now complete). There are also proposals for the river to be uncovered at the Warwick Bar area of Digbeth.

Near Gravelly Hill Interchange, about from its source, the Rea merges with the River Tame, with its waters eventually reaching the North Sea via the Trent and the Humber Estuary.

== Flood prevention measures ==

The Rea frequently bursts its banks after heavy rain. A £2.7 million scheme to reduce the risk of flooding to more than 200 homes and businesses in the south of Selly Park was completed in January 2018.

<text>The Drawa () is a river and popular aquatic trail in Poland, 192 km long. The surface of its catchment area amounts to 3291 km2. The Drawa begins its course at Lake Krzywe in Drawsko Landscape Park and ends it in Noteć below Krzyż Wielkopolski. The Drawa is a right-bank tributary of Noteć, the second regarding size. Its average gradient is 0,61% and its flow rate 19 m3/s. It is the longest river in Pojezierze Drawskie.

==Geography==
The Drawa flows across regions including Pojezierze Drawskie, Równina Drawska and partly near Pojezierze Wałeckie and Kotlina Gorzowska. The source of the Drawa is in nature reserve Dolina Pięciu Jezior. Then, the river flows across Drawski Landscape Park, Drawieński National Park and Drawski forest.
The section from Czaplinek to Noteć is called the Karol Wojtyła Silver Route.

==Tributaries==
The biggest tributaries of the Drawa are the Kokna, Korytnica, Mierzęcka Struga, Płociczna, Pokrętna, Słopica, Wąsowa. The main streams of the river are the Bagnica, Drawsko, Drawka, Głęboka, Miedzniki, Moczel, Pełknica, Radówka, Sitna, Studzienica, Sucha, Szczuczna, Wilżnica.

One canal, Prostynia, flows into the Drawa.

==Lakes==
The Drawa flows through many lakes. In the upper region of the river there are Górne, Krąg, Długie, Głębokie, . Further down the river, the lakes Prosino, Żerdno, Drawsko Lake, Rzepowskie, Lubie, Krosino, Wielkie and Małe Dębno can be found.

==Towns==
*Czaplinek
*Złocieniec
*Drawsko Pomorskie
*Prostynia
*Drawno
*Stare Osieczno
*Przedborowo
*Krzyż Wielkopolski

==Flora and fauna==
The river contains over thirty species of fish, including the Rutilus, perch, gudgeon, European chub, burbot, trout, grayling, barbel, bream, spirlin and silver bream. The river is also a place of living of the rare specimens – sea trout, common minnow, european bullhead and vimba vimba.

The Drawa also hosts buzzards, red algae, sponges, spargania and potamogeton.

==History==
From the 14th century, the river has been used as a navigational route. Since 1700, the Drawa has been used for drifting honey from Drawsko to Frankfurt. Navigation of the river continued until World War II.

In 1974, on the river route was founded a nature reserve Drawa and in 1990 Drawieński National Park.

==Attractions==
The Drawa flows near various historical buildings. One of them is Drahimski Castle, which was turned into the museum. The castle was built in 1360 by the Order of Saint John. There are also interesting bunkers near camping in Kotlina. On Drawa&#x27;s route Wedel&#x27;s Castle, from the 14th century, can also be found. On one of the banks, Wydrzy Głaz can be found (Moczele). 
On the section of the river from Lubie to Prostynia, rafting and canoeing are forbidden because the Drawski Training Ground is located in that area.

<text>Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca (; 1488/90/92 after 19 May 1559) was a Spanish explorer of the New World, and one of four survivors of the 1527 Narváez expedition. During eight years of traveling across what is now the US Southwest, he became a trader and faith healer to various Native American tribes before reconnecting with Spanish civilization in Mexico in 1536. After returning to Spain in 1537, he wrote an account, first published in 1542 as &quot;La relación y comentarios&quot; (&quot;The Account and Commentaries&quot;), which in later editions was retitled &quot;Naufragios y comentarios&quot; (&quot;Shipwrecks and Commentaries&quot;). Cabeza de Vaca is sometimes considered a proto-anthropologist for his detailed accounts of the many tribes of Native Americans that he encountered.

In 1540, Cabeza de Vaca was appointed &quot;adelantado&quot; of what is now Paraguay, where he was governor and captain general of New Andalusia. He worked to build up the population of Buenos Aires but, charged with poor administration, he was arrested in 1544 and then transported to Spain for trial in 1545. Although his sentence was eventually commuted, he never returned to the Americas. He introduced the story of the India Juliana in his accounts.

==Early life and family==
Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca was born around 1490 in the Andalusian town of Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz. His father, Francisco de Vera Mendoza y Hinojosa was an , a rank of minor Spanish nobility. His mother was María Teresa Cabeza de Vaca y Zurita, also from an &quot;hidalgo&quot; family. He was named after his mother&#x27;s great-grandfather, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, but the real influence in his life was his paternal grandfather, Pedro de Vera y Mendoza.

Pedro de Vera was described by contemporaries as an expert in fighting battles on land and sea. He led raids against the Moors in North Africa and in 1483 completed the conquest of Grand Canaria, one of the major islands of the Canaries. He was appointed military governor of the island and used his position to capture Canary natives (Guanches) and sell them as slaves in Spain. When natives on the neighboring island of Gomera revolted, he brutally put down the rebellion, killing males over the age of fifteen and selling the women and children into slavery. He was heavily fined for his actions and recalled to Castile in 1490. Cabeza de Vaca would have heard of these exploits growing up; many years later he named a province in South America, Vera, in honor of his grandfather.

Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s father and grandfather died around 1506 and his mother died in 1509, leaving behind a modest estate for her seven children. His younger siblings went to live with their aunt but Álvar had already entered the service of Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia in 1503. The house of Medina Sidonia was one of the most powerful in Andalusia and was a dominant force in Seville, the commercial center of Spain&#x27;s growing overseas empire. Cabeza de Vaca served as a page and then chamberlain for the duke. In 1511 he traveled to Italy to fight against the French in the Italian Wars. In February 1512 he took part in the Battle of Ravenna where the Spanish were badly defeated and Cabeza de Vaca was wounded. He later served as the royal standard-bearer in Gaeta, near Naples.

In 1513 he returned to Spain, still in the service of Medina Sidonia. At some point he married María Marmolejo, member of a prominent &quot;converso&quot; family in Seville. When the Revolt of the Comuneros broke out in 1520 against the new Spanish king, Charles V, Cabeza de Vaca fought alongside the duke on behalf of the crown. When the &quot;comuneros&quot; tried unsuccessfully to seize control in Seville in September, the duke put him in charge of defending one of the city gates; in December he fought to liberate the city of Tordesillas; and on 23 April 1521 he participated in the defeat of the &quot;comuneros&quot; at the battle of Villalar. Later in 1521 when the French king, Francis I, invaded Navarre, Cabeza de Vaca fought against them in the battle of Puente de la Reina.

In 1527, Cabeza de Vaca appeared at the royal court in Valladolid and received an appointment as royal treasurer for an expedition to be led by conquistador Pánfilo de Narváez to explore and conquer La Florida, a portion of North America roughly comprising today&#x27;s southeastern United States. The reasons for his selection are not known but his history of loyal military service to the crown was certainly a critical qualification. He also had a relative, Luis Cabeza de Vaca, serving on the all-important Council of the Indies.

==Narváez expedition==

On 11 December 1526, Charles V commissioned Pánfilo de Narváez to explore, conquer, and settle a portion of North America called &quot;La Florida&quot;, a territory vaguely described as stretching along the Gulf coast from Mexico to Florida. Cabeza de Vaca was named treasurer by royal appointment, a position that put him second in command and made him chiefly responsible to look after the emperor&#x27;s interests during the expedition. He was promised an annual salary of 130,000 &quot;maravedies&quot;, payable upon his return. Their fleet of five vessels set sail from Spain on 17 June 1527, carrying 600 soldiers and colonists, including a few married women and African slaves.

When they stopped in Hispaniola for supplies, Narváez lost more than 140 of his men, who chose to stay behind rather than continue with the expedition. They spent forty-five days on the island re-provisioning the fleet, and bought a sixth ship. They were especially anxious to acquire horses, but there was a shortage of them in Hispaniola, so the expedition continued to Cuba, where they hoped to recruit more men and buy horses. Narváez anchored at Santiago de Cuba and ordered Cabeza de Vaca to take two ships and proceed further up the coast to pick up additional provisions at Trinidad. In October, while Cabeza de Vaca was ashore negotiating for supplies, a hurricane hit the coast, resulting in the destruction of both ships and the loss of sixty men and twenty horses. Narváez arrived in early November to pick up the survivors. Fearful of encountering another storm, Narváez decided to overwinter in Cuba. The four remaining ships anchored in the Bay of Jagua under the command of Cabeza de Vaca.

While Cabeza de Vaca watched over the ships and crew, Narváez remained on shore to find replacements for the lost ships and hire more men. In February 1528, he returned to the Bay of Jagua with one additional ship and another one waiting for them in Havana. They resumed their expedition to &quot;La Florida&quot; with the intention of first stopping in Havana to pick up the final ship and more supplies. Before reaching Havana however, they were hit by another storm and blown off course into the Gulf of Mexico. Short of supplies and fresh water, they decided to push on toward Florida rather than try to get back to Cuba. In April they sighted land, anchored and went ashore. Although the location of their landing has been much debated, more recent opinion leans toward the vicinity of Tampa Bay.

During a quick reconnaissance of the area, they came upon a few small villages of Indians belonging to the Safety Harbor culture. Communicating with them through sign language, the Spanish were informed that a community or region called Apalachee lay to the north and was rich with food and gold. Cabeza de Vaca later noted that whenever Narváez expressed interest in something, the Indians assured him it could be found in great quantities at Apalachee. As a result, Narváez was determined to lead a force north into the interior to find this rich country.

Despite strong objections from Cabeza de Vaca, Narváez decided to split his expedition. He would lead some 300 men and 42 horses overland to Apalachee while the remaining crew, including the women, would sail ahead to find a suitable harbor and await their return. Cabeza de Vaca protested that dividing their forces would put both groups in danger without any certainty that they would be able to find each other again. He advised that everyone remain with the ships until a suitable harbor could be found to serve as their base camp. Narváez ignored his advice and suggested that if Cabeza de Vaca was afraid, he should stay with the ships. Cabeza de Vaca rejected the suggestion of cowardice and participated in the overland march. He later wrote, &quot;I preferred risking my life to placing my honor in jeopardy.&quot;

Narváez and his men set off overland in early May, 1528. They marched north for 15 days without seeing any Indians or native settlements. Then, as they were attempting to cross a swift-flowing river (probably the Withlacoochee), they were confronted by a group of 200 Indians. The encounter quickly turned into a fight and the Indians were driven off. Nearby, the Spaniards found a village where they stayed for several days and helped themselves to the stored maize. Cabeza de Vaca pleaded with Narváez to send a scouting expedition downriver in hopes of finding a bay where their ships might be waiting. Narváez relented and ordered Cabeza de Vaca to lead a reconnaissance. After two attempts to find their way through the swamps and heavy forest, their search yielded no ships or suitable harbor.

Narváez still hoped to find riches at Apalachee, so the expedition pressed forward using captive Indians as guides. Seven weeks after leaving their ships, they came upon the largest village they had found so far, a collection of forty houses. Their guides assured them this was a major Apalachee settlement, so Narváez ordered Cabeza de Vaca to lead about fifty soldiers to seize the village. There was no resistance to their attack and Cabeza de Vaca found only women and children whom he rounded up to serve as hostages. A thorough search of the houses found plenty of food but none of the hoped for gold and gems.

Apalachee had no gold but had only corn, but the explorers were told a village known as Aute, about 5 or 9 days away, was rich. They pushed on through the swamps, harassed by the Native Americans. A few Spanish men were killed and more wounded. When they arrived in Aute, they found that the inhabitants had burned down the village and left. But the fields had not been harvested, so at least the Spanish scavenged food there. After several months of fighting native inhabitants through wilderness and swamp, the party decided to abandon the interior and try to reach Pánuco.

Slaughtering and eating their remaining horses, they gathered the stirrups, spurs, horseshoes and other metal items. They fashioned a bellows from deer hide to make a fire hot enough to forge tools and nails. They used these to make five primitive boats in hopes of reaching Mexico. The small flotilla launched on 22 September 1528, carrying the 242 survivors. Cabeza de Vaca commanded one of the vessels, each of which held approximately 50 men. Depleted of food and water, they followed the coast westward. But when they reached the mouth of the Mississippi River, the powerful current swept them out into the Gulf, where the five rafts were separated by a hurricane. Some lives were lost, including that of Narváez.

In November 1528, two crafts with about 40 survivors each, including Cabeza de Vaca, wrecked on or near Galveston Island (now part of Texas). Of the 80 or so survivors, only 15 lived past that winter. The explorers called the island Malhado (&quot;Ill fate&quot; in Spanish), or the Island of Doom. They tried to repair the rafts, using what remained of their own clothes as oakum to plug holes, but they lost the rafts to a large wave.

As the number of survivors dwindled rapidly, they were enslaved for four years by various American Indian nomadic tribes of the upper Gulf Coast. The tribes to which Cabeza de Vaca was enslaved included the Hans and the Capoques, and tribes later called the Karankawa and Coahuiltecan. Only four men managed to escape: Cabeza de Vaca, Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, and an African slave of Dorantes, Estevanico.

Traveling mostly with this small group, Cabeza de Vaca walked generally south through what is now the U.S. state of Texas, as well as the northeastern Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila, and possibly smaller portions of New Mexico and Arizona. He traveled on foot through areas near the Gulf Coast, but encountered no other Europeans. Turning inland because of the threat of hostile Indians, he and his companions continued through Coahuila and Nueva Vizcaya (present-day states of Chihuahua and Durango); then down the Gulf of California coast to what is now Sinaloa, Mexico, over a period of roughly eight years. Throughout those years, Cabeza de Vaca and the other men adapted to the lives of the indigenous people they stayed with, whom he later described as Roots People, the Fish and Blackberry People, or the Fig People, depending on their principal foods.

During his wanderings, passing from tribe to tribe, Cabeza de Vaca later reported that he developed sympathies for the indigenous peoples. He became a trader and a healer, which gave him some freedom to travel among the tribes. His group attracted numerous native followers, who regarded them as &quot;children of the sun&quot;, endowed with the power to heal and destroy. As Cabeza de Vaca grew healthier, he decided that he would make his way to Pánuco, supporting himself through trading. He finally decided to try to reach the Spanish colony in Mexico. Many natives were said to accompany the explorers on their journey across what is now known as the American Southwest and northern Mexico.

After finally reaching the colonized lands of New Spain, where he first encountered fellow Spaniards near modern-day Culiacán, Cabeza de Vaca and the three other men reached Mexico City. From there he sailed back to Europe in 1537.

Numerous researchers have tried to trace his route across the Southwest. As he did not begin writing his chronicle until he was back in Spain, he had to rely on memory. He did not have instruments to determine his location; he had to rely on dead reckoning, and was uncertain of his route. Aware that his recollection has numerous errors in chronology and geography, historians have worked to put together pieces of the puzzle to discern his paths.

==Return to America==
In 1540, Cabeza de Vaca was appointed &quot;adelantado&quot; of the Río de la Plata in South America. The colony comprised parts of what is now Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Cabeza de Vaca was assigned to find a usable route from this colony to the riches of the former Incan Empire in Peru and Bolivia now controlled by the Spanish. The heartland of the empire was in the Andes Mountains near the Pacific Coast.
En route, he disembarked from his fleet at Santa Catarina Island in modern Brazil. With an indigenous force, plus 250 musketeers and 26 horses, he followed native trails discovered by Aleixo Garcia overland to the district&#x27;s Spanish capital, Asunción, far inland on the great Paraguay River. Cabeza de Vaca is thought to have been the first European to see the Iguaçu Falls.

In March 1542, Cabeza de Vaca met with Domingo Martínez de Irala and relieved him of his position as governor. The government of Asunción pledged loyalty to Cabeza de Vaca, and Irala was assigned to explore a possible route to Peru. Once Irala returned and reported, Cabeza de Vaca planned his own expedition. He hoped to reach Los Reyes (a base that Irala set up) and push forward into the jungle in search of a route to the gold and silver mines of Peru. The expedition did not go well, and Cabeza de Vaca returned to Asunción.

During Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s absence, Irala had stirred up resistance to his rule and capitalized on political rivalries. Scholars widely agree that Cabeza de Vaca had an unusually sympathetic attitude towards the Native Americans for his time. The elite settlers in modern Argentina, known as &quot;encomenderos&quot;, generally did not agree with his enlightened conduct toward the Natives; they wanted to use them for labor. Because he lost elite support, and Buenos Aires was failing as a settlement, not attracting enough residents, Martínez de Irala arrested Cabeza de Vaca in 1544 for poor administration. The former explorer was returned to Spain in 1545 for trial.

Although he was eventually exonerated, Cabeza de Vaca never returned to South America. He wrote an extensive report on the Río de la Plata colony in South America, strongly criticizing the conduct of Martínez de Irala. The report was bound with his earlier &quot;La Relación&quot; and published under the title &quot;Comentarios&quot; (Commentary). He died in Jerez de la Frontera or Valladolid on an uncertain date, although there are no surviving records of him after 19 May 1559.

==&quot;La relación de Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca&quot;==

 (&quot;The story of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca&quot;) is the account of his experiences with the Narváez expedition and after being wrecked on Galveston Island in November 1528. Cabeza de Vaca and his last three men struggled to survive. They wandered along the Texas coast as prisoners of the Han and Capoque American Indians for two years, while Cabeza de Vaca observed the people, picking up their ways of life and customs. They traveled through the American Southwest and ultimately reached Mexico City, nearly eight years after being wrecked on the island.

In 1537, Cabeza de Vaca returned to Spain, where he wrote his narratives of the Narváez expedition. These narratives were collected and published in 1542 in Spain. They are now known as &quot;The Relation of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca.&quot; The narrative of Cabeza de Vaca is the &quot;first European book devoted completely to North America.&quot; His detailed account describes the lives of numerous tribes of American Indians of the time. Cabeza de Vaca showed compassion and respect for native peoples, which, together with the great detail he recorded, distinguishes his narrative from others of the period.

===Role of observer===
Cabeza de Vaca reported on the customs and ways of American Indian life, aware of his status as an early European explorer. He spent eight years with various peoples, including the Capoque, Han, Avavare, and Arbadao. He describes details of the culture of the Malhado people, the Capoque, and Han American Indians, such as their treatment of offspring, their wedding rites, and their main sources of food. Cabeza de Vaca and his three fellow survivors at times served as slaves to the American Indians to survive. Through his observations, Cabeza de Vaca provides insights into 16th-century American Indian life near the present-day Mexico-Texas border.

For many peoples the accounts of Cabeza de Vaca and Hernando de Soto are the only written records of their existence. By the time of the next European contact, many had vanished, possibly from diseases carried by Cabeza de Vaca and his companions.

===Ambassador for Christ===
One of Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s greatest accomplishments in his journey was bringing peace throughout the land. As the travellers passed from one tribe to the next, warring tribes would immediately make peace and become friendly, so that the natives could receive the party and give them gifts. Cabeza noted in his personal account of the journey that, in this way, &quot;We left the whole country in peace.&quot; Cabeza de Vaca saw these events as part of his purpose in America, writing that he believed that &quot;God was guiding us to where we could serve Him.&quot;

Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s greatest challenge as an ambassador came when he attempted to bring peace between the conquering Spanish army and the natives. As Cabeza approached the area of Spanish settlement, he and his companions grieved to see the destruction of the native villages and enslavement of the native peoples. The fertile land lay uncultivated and the natives were nearly starving, hiding in the forest, for fear of the Spanish army.

Cabeza de Vaca then encountered Diego de Alcaraz, commander of a slaving expedition of about 20 horsemen, and attempted to negotiate peace between them and the natives. However, as soon as they departed, Alcaraz went back on his word and plundered Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s entourage of natives that he had sent back home. Not long afterward, Cabeza de Vaca encountered the chief &quot;alcalde&quot; (Spanish captain of the province), Melchor Díaz. Díaz ordered Cabeza de Vaca to bring the natives back from the forests so that they would resume cultivating the land. Cabeza de Vaca and Díaz invited the natives to convert to Christianity, and the natives did so willingly. Cabeza de Vaca then instructed them to build a large wooden cross in each village, so that Spanish soldiers would pass through the village and not attack it. Soon afterward, Alcaraz&#x27;s expedition returned and explained to Díaz that they were amazed to find, on their return journey, that not only was the land repopulated, but the natives coming to greet them with crosses in hand and also gave them provisions. Díaz then ordered Alcaraz to do no harm to these natives.

===Personal report===
Cabeza de Vaca wrote this narrative to Charles V to &quot;transmit what I saw and heard in the nine years I wandered lost and miserable over many remote lands&quot;. He wanted to convey &quot;not merely a report of positions and distances, flora and fauna, but of the customs of the numerous indigenous people I talked with and dwelt among, as well as any other matters I could hear of or observe&quot;. He took care to present facts, as a full account of what he observed. &quot;The Relation&quot; is the only account of many details concerning the indigenous people whom he encountered. The accuracy of his account has been validated by later reports of others, as well as by the oral traditions of descendants of some of the tribes.

Cabeza&#x27;s account also served as a petition to the King of Spain to both establish a permanent Christian mission and eventually establish the native tribes as a nation under the governance of Spain. In his reflection Cabeza writes to the king of Spain:

:&quot;May God in His infinite mercy grant that in the days of Your Majesty and under your power and sway, these people become willingly and sincerely subjects of the true Lord Who created and redeemed them. We believe they will be, and that Your Majesty is destined to bring it about, as it will not be at all difficult.&quot;

Cabeza continued to be a strong advocate for the rights of Native American Indians throughout his lifetime.

===American Indian nations noted by name===
Cabeza De Vaca identified the following peoples by name in his &quot;La Relación&quot; (1542). The following list shows his names, together with what scholars suggested in 1919 were the likely tribes identified by names used in the 20th century. By that time, tribal identification was also related to more linguistic data.

Possible &quot;Karankawan&quot; groups:
* Capoques – Cocos
* Deaguanes – Cujanes
* Quevenes – Copanes
* Guaycones – Guapites
* Camones – Karankaguases?

Related to Karankawa:
* Charruco – Bidai-Orcoquiza
* Han – Bidai-Orcoquiza

Possible &quot;Tonkawan&quot; groups:
* Mendica – Tamiques
* Mariames – Jaranames
* Iguaces – Anaquas

Possible &quot;Coahuiltecan&quot; or desert groups:
* Quitoles
* The &quot;Fig People&quot;
* Acubadaos
* Avavares
* Anegados
* Cutalchuches
* Maliacones
* Susolas
* Comos – Comecrudo
* Cuayos
* Arbadaos
* Atayos - Adai Caddo Indian Nation
* Cuchendados

==&quot;Comentarios&quot;==
In 1555, after a four-year position as Adelantado in Rio de la Plata, Cabeza de Vaca wrote from memory a chronicle of his in South America. It is believed that his secretary at the time, Pero Hernández, transcribed Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s account in what is known as &quot;Comentarios&quot;. The publication of &quot;Comentarios&quot; was appended to &quot;La relación&quot; as a joint publication in Valladolid, Spain entitled: &quot;Naufragios.&quot; At that time, explorers often published their reports of travels in foreign lands.

===Later editions===
In 1906, &quot;Naufragios&quot; was published in a new edition in Madrid, Spain. The introduction says the intent of this edition was to publicize Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s observations and experiences to strengthen authentic representations. This has been described as having the objective of portraying Cabeza de Vaca as less aggressive , while trying to authenticate his role as a sympathetic observer of the natives.

==Place in Chicano literature==
Herrera (2011) classifies Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s &quot;La Relacion&quot; as the first major contribution to Chicano literature. Scholars have identified five major periods of Chicano literature: Spanish Mexican, Mexican American, Annexation, Chicano Renaissance, and Modern. Cabeza de Vaca is classified as part of the Spanish Mexican period; he recounted eight years of travel and survival in the area of Chicano culture: present-day Texas, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. His account is the first known written description of the American Southwest.

==Film adaptation==
* The drama feature film &quot;Cabeza de Vaca&quot; (1991), a Mexican production, was directed by Nicolás Echevarría and starred Juan Diego. Based on &quot;Naufragios&quot;, the film was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival.

==Representation in other media==
Laila Lalami&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Account&quot; (2014), is a fictional memoir of Estevanico, the Moroccan slave who survived the journey and accompanied Cabeza de Vaca through the Southwest. He is considered to be the first black explorer of North America.

Lord Buckley created a monologue &quot;The Gasser&quot; based on Haniel Long&#x27;s novella. This was first recorded in 1954 and again in 1959.

His story is noted in the first episode of Ken Burns&#x27; &quot;The West&quot;, a PBS documentary which first aired in 1996.

Russell Persson&#x27;s &quot;The Way of Florida&quot; (Little Island Press, 2017) is a highly stylized novelization of Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s &quot;Relación.&quot;

&quot;The Great Journey of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca&quot; is a work composed between 1981 and 1988 by Colin Matthews.

<doc id="395146" wikidata="Q1455991" url="?curid=395146" title="Eastern Neisse">
<text>The Eastern Neisse, also known by its Polish name of Nysa Kłodzka (, ), is a river in southwestern Poland, a left tributary of the Oder, with a length of 188 km (21st longest) and a basin area of 4,570 km2 (3,742 in Poland).

Prior to World War II it was part of Germany. During the Yalta Conference it was discussed by the Western Allies as one possible line of the western Polish border. Attempts were made to negotiate a compromise with the Soviets on the new Polish-German frontier; it was suggested that the Eastern Neisse be made the line of demarcation. This would have meant that (East) Germany could have retained approximately half of Silesia, including most of Wrocław (formerly Breslau). However the Soviets rejected the suggestion at the Potsdam Conference and insisted that the southern boundary between Germany and Poland be drawn further west, at the Lusatian Neisse, in some way reintroducing the border to the place from the beginnings of Polish statehood, i.e. west of Legnica Town, important for Bolesław IV the Curly and Henry the Bearded, two Polish Princepses.

==Floods==
The Eastern Neisse originates in the Králický Sněžník Mountains of the Sudetes, near the border with the Czech Republic. It is partially regulated. The river has often burst its banks and flooded nearby towns, at times destroying them completely. Town chronicles from Kłodzko mention floods in the following years:

* 14th century: 1310
* 15th century: 1441, 1464, 1474
* 16th century: 1500, 1522, 1524, 1560, 1566, 1570, 1587, 1589, 1591, 1598,
* 17th century: 1602, 1603, 1605, 1610, 1611, 1612, 1625, 1646, 1652, 1655, 1689, 1693, 1696
* 18th century: 1702, 1703, 1713, 1724, 1735, 1736, 1740, 1755, 1763, 1767, 1775, 1785, 1787, 1789, 1799
* 19th century: 1804, 1806, 1827, 1828, 1829, 1831, 1850, 1854, 1879, 1881, 1883, 1891, 1897
* 20th century: 1900, 1903, 1907, 1938, 1952, 1997, 1998
* 21st century: 2024

==Towns==
Until 1945, these communities were situated on German territory and largely populated by Germans before they were driven out at the end of the Second World War. German names are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;.
* Bardo (&quot;Wartha&quot;)
* Bystrzyca Kłodzka (&quot;Habelschwerdt&quot;)
* Kamieniec Ząbkowicki (&quot;Kamenz N.S.&quot;)
* Kłodzko (&quot;Glatz&quot;)
* Lewin Brzeski (&quot;Löwen&quot;)
* Międzylesie (&quot;Mittelwalde&quot;) - both names mean &quot;middle of the woods&quot;
* Nysa (&quot;Neiße&quot;)
* Otmuchów (&quot;Ottmachau&quot;)
* Paczków (&quot;Patschkau&quot;)

<text>The Pasłęka (; ) is a river in northern Poland that debouches into the Baltic Sea on the Vistula Lagoon near Braniewo. It flows through the Olsztyn and Mrągowo lakelands, and through Gdańsk Coastal Area.

The reported length of the river varies, depending on sources, from .

The river springs nearby Olsztynek, between Stawiguda and Gryźliny, at AMSL; though some sources place it in the Pasłęk reservoir, which lies at AMSL.

The river flows through the town of Braniewo.

The drainage area of Pasłęka spreads over .

Pasłęka&#x27;s average mouth discharge equals .

The whole length of the river is covered by River Pasłęka Beaver Refugium nature reserve.

Pasłęka is one of Warmia&#x27;s two main rivers, accompanied by Łyna.

Pasłęka divides two historical lands: Warmia and Upper Prussia (&quot;Powiśle&quot;), consequently for centuries bordering Polish Warmia and the Polish fiefdoms of the Teutonic Order and Ducal Prussia.

In the 2007 water quality survey conducted on Pasłęka 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) from its mouth, its water was classified as the 4th class.&quot;

The historic Polish name &quot;Pasłęka&quot; was officially confirmed following World War II in 1949, replacing the former German name &quot;Passarge&quot;.

== Infrastructure ==
Pasłęka is sailable between its mouth in Nowa Pasłęka and the hydro plant in Braniewo.
Several hydro plants are built on the river:
* Braniewo - power: 0,815 MVA
* Pierzchały - power: 3,3 MVA, built in 1936
* Stygajny - planned at the site of the unfinished German weir 
* &#x27;Kormoran&#x27; in Łęgucki Młyn
* Kasztanowo. installed power of 0,1 MW, rebuilt after a complete destruction and reopened in 1989.

== Tributaries ==
* Rivers: Stara Pasłęka, Wałsza p., Giłwa, Jemiołówka, Marąg, Miłakówka.
* Streams: Bardynka, Biebrza, Drwęca Warmińska p., Lipówka, Łaźnica p., Młynówka, Młyńska Struga
* Canals: Kanał Rusy, Kanał Skolity, Kanał Energetyczny

Pasłęka crosses the following lakes: Wymój, Sarąg, Łęguty, Isąg.

<text>The Wda () is a river in Poland; it has a lowland character. The Wda is one of the 15 main canoe trails in Poland. It is 198 km long and the surface of its catchment area amounts to 2325 km2. The Wda&#x27;s average gradient is 0.7‰ and its flow is 6.52 m3/s.

The Wda begins its course at Krążno Lake and ends in the Wisła in Świecie. The Wda is one of the longest rivers in Bory Tucholskie and one of the most important of Pomorze&#x27;s river routes.

==Geography==
The source of Wda is on Równina Charzykowska in Krężno Lake. The river flows through the area of Bory Tucholskie, Wdzydzki Landscape Park and Wdecki Landscape Park.

There is one river&#x27;s canal below Wdzydze Lake. The river reaches Tleń, then flows across Wysoczyzna Świecka and ends in Wisła in Świecie on Dolina Fordońska.

==Lakes==
*Krężno
*Wieckie
*Lubiszewskie
*Schodno
*Radolne
*Wdzydze
*Żurskie
The Wdzydze Lake along with lakes Gołyń, Jeleń and Słupinek are called Morze Kaszubskie. This lakes take a shape of the cross made of postglacial channels. Wdzydze Lake is dangerous for inexperienced canoeists during strong winds.

==Towns==
*Lipusz
*Borsk
*Wojtal
*Czarna Woda
*Wda
*Błędno
*Tleń
*Żur
*Świecie

==Flora and fauna==
The Wda runs through many multispecies deciduous forests, in which contains diverse lichens. The river meanders also through riparian and alder forests. Rare mountain ash brekinii can be found in the Zygmunt Czubiński Reserve “Brzęki” in Szczerkowo. Next rare and protected plants on Wda&#x27;s route are: lycopodium clavatum, diphasiastrum complanatum, lycopodium annotinum, sundew, western marsh orchid, heath spotted orchid, lesser butterfly-orchid, broad-leaved helleborine, european common twayblade and arctostaphylos uva-ursi, which are found in Wdecki Landscape Park.
This region of Poland houses species like: cranes, common goldeneyes, goosanders, western marsh harriers, ruffs, kingfishers, trouts, common vipers, fire salamanders, tree frogs and great crested newts.

==History==
The name “Wda” has been already used in the Middle Ages, but the river is also known as Czarna Woda. This name comes from dark brown colour of water caused by marshy banks, mineral molecules in water and sludge from tar factories in the 19th century.
After World War I tourism started developing on Wda and about 40 years later Wda earned its title of The Queen of The Rivers of Kociew and The Beauty of The Land of Kociew.

==Hydroelectric power stations==
On the Wda&#x27;s route are three hydroelectric power stations located in Żur, Gródek and Kozłowo. In this area canoeists need to portage their canoes to the further part of the river.

<text>Wisłok is a river in south-eastern Poland, a tributary of the San River, with a length of 220 kilometres and a basin area of 3,538 km2 (all in Poland). The root of the name &quot;Vis-lok&quot; is Indo-European or pre-Indo-European.

The first metal bridges on highways were built in Galicia. They were bridges on the Wisłok river in Rzeszów (1877) and Raba in Książnica (1877). The construction of the first latticework metal bridges in Poland&#x27;s territories.

==History==
There is no data on the settlements in the early Iron period when an old trade route crossed the region along Wisłok River Valley.
The Wisłok valley must have been an important trade route and human settlement axis as early as 9th or 10th century. The region subsequently became part of the Great Moravian state. Upon the invasion of the Hungarian tribes into the heart of the Great Moravian Empire around 899, the Lendians of the area declared their allegiance to Hungarian Empire. The region then became a site of contention between Poland, Kievan Rus and Hungary starting in at least the 9th century. This area was mentioned for the first time in 981 (by Nestor), when Volodymyr the Great of Kievan Rus took the area over on the way into Poland. In 1018 it returned to Poland, 1031 back to Rus, in 1340 Casimir III of Poland recovered it

In historical records the river was first mentioned in 1372. During 966 – 1018, 1340–1772 (Ruthenian Voivodeship) and during 1918 – 1939 the region was a part of Poland.

Actually the intensive development of human settlements in the region took place during 13th–15th centuries. The settlements were located according to the German Law within an area flanked by Wisłok and Wisłoka rivers. 
Germans settled in the territory of the Kingdom of Poland (territory of present-day Województwo podkarpackie) from the 14th to 15th centuries (&quot;see Ostsiedlung&quot;), mostly after the region returned to Polish sphere of influence in 1340, when Casimir III of Poland took the Czerwień towns. 
There were probably some isolated settlers in the area of Krosno, Sanok, Łańcut, Biecz and Rzeszów earlier. The Germans were usually attracted by kings seeking specialists in various trades, such as craftsmen and miners. They usually settled in newer market and mining settlements. The main settlement areas were in the vicinity of Krosno and some language islands in the Pits and the Rzeszów regions. The settlers in the Pits region were known as &quot;Uplander Sachsen&quot;. Until approximately the 15th century, the ruling classes of most cities in present-day Beskidian Piedmont consisted almost exclusively of Germans.
While during 1772–1918 it belonged to Austrian empire, later Austrian-Hungarian empire when double monarchy was introduced in Austria. This part of Poland was controlled by Austria for almost 120 years. At that time the area (including west and east of Subcarpathian Voivodeship) was known as Galicia.

The line of the river Dunajec and that of the San, both in West Galicia, marked the two successive stages in the break-through battle which initiated the Austro-German offensive of 1915 on the eastern front. An attempt to stand on the line of the Wisłok river and the Łupków Pass failed before renewed Austro-German attacks on 8 May 1915. Wisłok Valley was one of the strategically important Carpathian rivers bitterly contested in battles on the Eastern Front of World War I during the winter of 1914–1915.

<text>The Brda (; ) is a river in northern Poland. A tributary of Vistula River, the Brda has a total length of 245 km and a catchment area of 4,665 km2, all within Poland.

==Navigation==
The Brda is part of the Odra-Vistula waterway, connecting these two rivers via the Warta and Noteć rivers and the Bydgoszcz Canal
since the end of the 18th century. The waterway is navigable for modest barges (of CEMT Class II) but with a limited draught.

With the expansion of the European Union to the East, the waterway could play an important role. It is a link in the much longer connection with Eastern Europe via the Vistula, Narew, Bug, Mukhavets, Pripyat, and Dnieper Rivers, but this connection remains unnavigable due to a dam near Brest, Belarus.

Currently, only limited numbers of vessels use the Brda River and the adjacent canal
(however, the traffic was significantly larger from 1950s to 1970s, then diminishing step by step as time went by). It is expected that the waterway will be discovered by leisure boaters in the future. (Source: NoorderSoft Waterways Database)

==Tourism==
Brda is one of the most beautiful kayak routes in Poland. The trail is 233 km long, and it goes through forests, lakes and fields.

<text>The Dunajec (; Goral dialects: &quot;Dónajec&quot;; ) is a river running through northeastern Slovakia and southern Poland. It is also regarded as the main river of the Goral Lands. It is a right tributary of the Vistula River. It begins in Nowy Targ at the junction of two short mountain rivers, Czarny Dunajec and Biały Dunajec (Black and White Dunajec). Dunajec forms the border between Poland and Slovakia for in the Pieniny Środkowe (Slovak: Centrálne Pieniny) range, east of the Czorsztyn reservoir.

==Geography==
The Dunajec is long, including its source river Czarny Dunajec, which makes it Poland&#x27;s thirteenth longest river. It has a basin area of ( in Poland, and in Slovakia). On the Slovak-Polish border, the Dunajec flows through the Zamagurie region, with attractions such as the Dunajec River Gorge, the Trzy Korony massif with a precipice, Červený Kláštor, and two Pieniny castles in Czorsztyn and Niedzica.

Below the two source streams, the Dunajec flows through a broad valley called Nowotarska Basin. It then supplies the waters of the dam in Niedzica (Jezioro Czorsztyńskie Lake) and the dam in Sromowce Wyżne (Sromowce Wyżne reservoir). Flowing through the central part of the Pieniny range, it creates a picturesque turn at the Polish Slovak border between Sromowce Wyżne and Szczawnica, where it flows by Kotuńka rock which differentiates the area from the over parts of the river. Further down, it turns to the north into the Western Beskid Mountains, and Sądecka Basin (where it merges with its own largest tributary, the Poprad river). It flows across an open valley of the Beskid Foothills and falls down across Rożnów Foothills (with two more dams: the Jezioro Rożnowskie Lake, and Jezioro Czchowskie Lake) and finally, it leads into the Sandomierz Basin and the valley of Vistula Lowlands. The Dunajec flows into the Vistula River in the vicinity of Opatowiec.

<doc id="395167" wikidata="Q273090" url="?curid=395167" title="Froude number">
<text>In continuum mechanics, the Froude number (, after William Froude, ) is a dimensionless number defined as the ratio of the flow inertia to the external force field (the latter in many applications simply due to gravity). The Froude number is based on the speed–length ratio which he defined as:
formula_1
where is the local flow velocity (in m/s), is the local gravity field (in m/s2), and is a characteristic length (in m). 

The Froude number has some analogy with the Mach number. In theoretical fluid dynamics the Froude number is not frequently considered since usually the equations are considered in the high Froude limit of negligible external field, leading to homogeneous equations that preserve the mathematical aspects. For example, homogeneous Euler equations are conservation equations.
However, in naval architecture the Froude number is a significant figure used to determine the resistance of a partially submerged object moving through water.

==Origins==
In open channel flows, introduced first the ratio of the flow velocity to the square root of the gravity acceleration times the flow depth. When the ratio was less than unity, the flow behaved like a fluvial motion (i.e., subcritical flow), and like a torrential flow motion when the ratio was greater than unity.

 Quantifying resistance of floating objects is generally credited to William Froude, who used a series of scale models to measure the resistance each model offered when towed at a given speed. The naval constructor Frederic Reech had put forward the concept much earlier in 1852 for testing ships and propellers but Froude was unaware of it. Speed–length ratio was originally defined by Froude in his &quot;Law of Comparison&quot; in 1868 in dimensional terms as:
formula_2
where:
* = flow speed
* = length of waterline

The term was converted into non-dimensional terms and was given Froude&#x27;s name in recognition of the work he did. In France, it is sometimes called Reech–Froude number after Frederic Reech.

==Definition and main application==
To show how the Froude number is linked to general continuum mechanics and not only to hydrodynamics we start from the Cauchy momentum equation in its dimensionless (nondimensional) form.

===Cauchy momentum equation===

In order to make the equations dimensionless, a characteristic length r0, and a characteristic velocity u0, need to be defined. These should be chosen such that the dimensionless variables are all of order one. The following dimensionless variables are thus obtained:
formula_3

Substitution of these inverse relations in the Euler momentum equations, and definition of the Froude number:
formula_4
and the Euler number:
formula_5
the equations are finally expressed (with the material derivative and now omitting the indexes):

Cauchy-type equations in the high Froude limit (corresponding to negligible external field) are named free equations. On the other hand, in the low Euler limit (corresponding to negligible stress) general Cauchy momentum equation becomes an inhomogeneous Burgers equation (here we make explicit the material derivative):

This is an inhomogeneous pure advection equation, as much as the Stokes equation is a pure diffusion equation.

===Euler momentum equation===

Euler momentum equation is a Cauchy momentum equation with the Pascal law being the stress constitutive relation:
formula_6
in nondimensional Lagrangian form is:
formula_7

Free Euler equations are conservative. The limit of high Froude numbers (low external field) is thus notable and can be studied with perturbation theory.

===Incompressible Navier–Stokes momentum equation===

Incompressible Navier–Stokes momentum equation is a Cauchy momentum equation with the Pascal law and Stokes&#x27;s law being the stress constitutive relations:
formula_8
in nondimensional convective form it is:
formula_9
where is the Reynolds number. Free Navier–Stokes equations are dissipative (non conservative).

==Other applications==

===Ship hydrodynamics===

In marine hydrodynamic applications, the Froude number is usually referenced with the notation and is defined as:
formula_10
where is the relative flow velocity between the sea and ship, is in particular the acceleration due to gravity, and is the length of the ship at the water line level, or in some notations. It is an important parameter with respect to the ship&#x27;s drag, or resistance, especially in terms of wave making resistance.

In the case of planing craft, where the waterline length is too speed-dependent to be meaningful, the Froude number is best defined as &quot;displacement Froude number&quot; and the reference length is taken as the cubic root of the volumetric displacement of the hull:
formula_11

===Shallow water waves===
For shallow water waves, such as tsunamis and hydraulic jumps, the characteristic velocity is the average flow velocity, averaged over the cross-section perpendicular to the flow direction. The wave velocity, termed celerity , is equal to the square root of gravitational acceleration , times cross-sectional area , divided by free-surface width :
formula_12
so the Froude number in shallow water is:
formula_13
For rectangular cross-sections with uniform depth , the Froude number can be simplified to:
formula_14
For the flow is called a subcritical flow, further for the flow is characterised as supercritical flow. When the flow is denoted as critical flow.

===Wind engineering===
When considering wind effects on dynamically sensitive structures such as suspension bridges it is sometimes necessary to simulate the combined effect of the vibrating mass of the structure with the fluctuating force of the wind. In such cases, the Froude number should be respected. 
Similarly, when simulating hot smoke plumes combined with natural wind, Froude number scaling is necessary to maintain the correct balance between buoyancy forces and the momentum of the wind.

=== Allometry ===
The Froude number has also been applied in allometry to studying the locomotion of terrestrial animals, including antelope and dinosaurs.

==Extended Froude number==
Geophysical mass flows such as avalanches and debris flows take place on inclined slopes which then merge into gentle and flat run-out zones.

So, these flows are associated with the elevation of the topographic slopes that induce the gravity potential energy together with the pressure potential energy during the flow. Therefore, the classical Froude number should include this additional effect. For such a situation, Froude number needs to be re-defined. The extended Froude number is defined as the ratio between the kinetic and the potential energy:
formula_15
where is the mean flow velocity, , ( is the earth pressure coefficient, is the slope), , is the channel downslope position and formula_16 is the distance from the point of the mass release along the channel to the point where the flow hits the horizontal reference datum; and are the pressure potential and gravity potential energies, respectively. In the classical definition of the shallow-water or granular flow Froude number, the potential energy associated with the surface elevation, , is not considered. The extended Froude number differs substantially from the classical Froude number for higher surface elevations. The term emerges from the change of the geometry of the moving mass along the slope. Dimensional analysis suggests that for shallow flows , while and are both of order unity. If the mass is shallow with a virtually bed-parallel free-surface, then can be disregarded. In this situation, if the gravity potential is not taken into account, then is unbounded even though the kinetic energy is bounded. So, formally considering the additional contribution due to the gravitational potential energy, the singularity in Fr is removed.

===Stirred tanks===
In the study of stirred tanks, the Froude number governs the formation of surface vortices. Since the impeller tip velocity is (circular motion), where is the impeller frequency (usually in rpm) and is the impeller radius (in engineering the diameter is much more frequently employed), the Froude number then takes the following form:
formula_17
The Froude number finds also a similar application in powder mixers. It will indeed be used to determine in which mixing regime the blender is working. If Fr&lt;1, the particles are just stirred, but if Fr&gt;1, centrifugal forces applied to the powder overcome gravity and the bed of particles becomes fluidized, at least in some part of the blender, promoting mixing

===Densimetric Froude number===

When used in the context of the Boussinesq approximation the densimetric Froude number is defined as
formula_18
where is the reduced gravity:
formula_19

The densimetric Froude number is usually preferred by modellers who wish to nondimensionalize a speed preference to the Richardson number which is more commonly encountered when considering stratified shear layers. For example, the leading edge of a gravity current moves with a front Froude number of about unity.

===Walking Froude number===

The Froude number may be used to study trends in animal gait patterns. In analyses of the dynamics of legged locomotion, a walking limb is often modeled as an inverted pendulum, where the center of mass goes through a circular arc centered at the foot. The Froude number is the ratio of the centripetal force around the center of motion, the foot, and the weight of the animal walking:
formula_20
where is the mass, is the characteristic length, is the acceleration due to gravity and is the velocity. The characteristic length may be chosen to suit the study at hand. For instance, some studies have used the vertical distance of the hip joint from the ground, while others have used total leg length.

The Froude number may also be calculated from the stride frequency as follows:
formula_21

If total leg length is used as the characteristic length, then the theoretical maximum speed of walking has a Froude number of 1.0 since any higher value would result in takeoff and the foot missing the ground. The typical transition speed from bipedal walking to running occurs with . R. M. Alexander found that animals of different sizes and masses travelling at different speeds, but with the same Froude number, consistently exhibit similar gaits. This study found that animals typically switch from an amble to a symmetric running gait (e.g., a trot or pace) around a Froude number of 1.0. A preference for asymmetric gaits (e.g., a canter, transverse gallop, rotary gallop, bound, or pronk) was observed at Froude numbers between 2.0 and 3.0.

==Usage==

The Froude number is used to compare the wave making resistance between bodies of various sizes and shapes.

In free-surface flow, the nature of the flow (supercritical or subcritical) depends upon whether the Froude number is greater than or less than unity.

One can easily see the line of &quot;critical&quot; flow in a kitchen or bathroom sink. Leave it unplugged and let the faucet run. Near the place where the stream of water hits the sink, the flow is supercritical. It &#x27;hugs&#x27; the surface and moves quickly. On the outer edge of the flow pattern the flow is subcritical. This flow is thicker and moves more slowly. The boundary between the two areas is called a &quot;hydraulic jump&quot;. The jump starts where the flow is just critical and Froude number is equal to 1.0.

The Froude number has been used to study trends in animal locomotion in order to better understand why animals use different gait patterns as well as to form hypotheses about the gaits of extinct species.

In addition particle bed behavior can be quantified by Froude number (Fr) in order to establish the optimum operating window.

<text>Maurice Samuel Vaughn (born December 15, 1967), nicknamed &quot;the Hit Dog&quot;, is an American former Major League Baseball first baseman who played for the Boston Red Sox, Anaheim Angels, and New York Mets from 1991 to 2003. He was a three-time All-Star selection and won the American League MVP award in with Boston.

==Early life and education==
Vaughn attended New Canaan Country School in New Canaan, Connecticut. He played baseball for Trinity-Pawling School in Pawling, New York.

Vaughn played college baseball at Seton Hall for head coach Mike Sheppard. While there he set the school record for home runs with 28. In his three years at Seton Hall he hit a total of 57 home runs and 218 RBIs, both team records. His teammates included seven-time All-Star and Hall of Famer Craig Biggio, Red Sox teammate John Valentin, and Kevin Morton. Vaughn earned the Jack Kaiser Award as MVP of the 1987 Big East Conference baseball tournament while keying the Pirates&#x27; championship run.

While at Seton Hall, Vaughn played collegiate summer baseball for two years (1987–88) with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), and in 2000 was named a member of the inaugural class of the CCBL Hall of Fame.

At Seton Hall, his brothers in Omega Psi Phi gave him the nickname &quot;Hit Dog.&quot;

==Professional career==

===Boston Red Sox===
Vaughn became the centerpiece of the Red Sox&#x27;s line-up in 1993, hitting 29 home runs and contributing 101 RBIs. In 1995, he established a reputation as one of the most feared hitters in the American League when he hit 39 home runs with 126 RBIs and a .300 average. He also garnered 11 stolen bases. His efforts, which led the Red Sox to the playoffs (only to lose to the Cleveland Indians in the American League Division Series), were rewarded with the American League MVP award.

Vaughn had his career year with the Red Sox in 1996, playing in 161 games with a batting average of .326 and a career-high 44 home runs, 143 RBIs, 207 hits and 118 runs scored. On September 24, 1996, he hit three home runs against the Orioles, going 4–5 with five RBI in a 13–8 win. On April 15, 1997, MLB retired the number 42 to honour Jackie Robinson, but Vaughn was one of multiple players who were allowed to continue wearing the number for the rest of their careers. In a May 30, 1997, game against the Yankees, Vaughn went 4-for-4 with three solo homers in the Red Sox&#x27;s 10–4 win.

Vaughn continued to improve over the next several seasons, batting .315 or higher from 1996 to 1998 and averaging 40 home runs and 118 RBIs. The Red Sox lost in the American League Division Series in 1998, once again to the Cleveland Indians, although Vaughn played well, hitting two home runs and driving in seven runs in game one.

He was noted for &quot;crowding the plate&quot;; his stance was such that his front elbow often appeared to be hovering in the strike zone, which intimidated pitchers into throwing outside pitches.

====Last season with the Sox====

Though Vaughn&#x27;s powerful personality and extensive charity work made him a popular figure in Boston, he had many issues with the Red Sox management and local media; his disagreements with &quot;Boston Globe&quot; sports columnist Will McDonough and Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette were particularly acute. As an outspoken clubhouse leader, Vaughn repeatedly stated that the concerned Sox administration did not want him around. Incidents in which he allegedly punched a man in the mouth outside of a nightclub and crashed his truck while returning home from a strip club in Providence led to further rifts with the administration.

Vaughn hit a walk-off grand slam in the ninth inning of Opening Day at Fenway Park against the Seattle Mariners in 1998. Vaughn was one half of a formidable middle of the lineup with shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. The two combined for 75 home runs in 1998, Vaughn&#x27;s final year with the club. After the Cleveland Indians knocked Boston out of the playoffs in the first round, Vaughn became a free agent. Almost immediately, he signed a six-year, $80-million deal with the Anaheim Angels, the highest contract in the game at that time.

===Anaheim Angels===
While he hit well for Anaheim when he played—he hit 30-plus home runs and knocked in over 100 runs in both 1999 and 2000—Vaughn was plagued by injuries in 1999 and didn&#x27;t play a single game in the 2001 season. He started his Anaheim career by falling down the visitor&#x27;s dugout steps on his first play of his first game, badly spraining his ankle. Vaughn was nevertheless seen as a viable middle of the line-up producer before the 2002 season and was traded to the New York Mets for Kevin Appier on December 27, 2001.

Following Vaughn&#x27;s departure from Anaheim, Angels closer Troy Percival took a shot at him, saying &quot;We may miss Mo&#x27;s bat, but we won&#x27;t miss his leadership. Darin Erstad is our leader.&quot; This prompted the normally mild-mannered Vaughn to go off on a profanity-laced tirade, stating such statements as, &quot;They ain&#x27;t got no flags hanging at friggin&#x27; Edison Field, so the hell with them.&quot; The year after Vaughn left Anaheim, the Angels would reach and win the World Series.

===New York Mets===
With the Mets, Vaughn was counted upon to be a key catalyst in a revamped lineup that featured imports Roger Cedeño, Jeromy Burnitz, and Roberto Alomar. Vaughn got off to a slow start in 2002, and he was ridiculed in local sports columns and on sports talk radio shows for being out of shape; he weighed 268 pounds during his first season in New York. However, he hit his 300th career home run on April 3 against Pittsburgh Pirates starting pitcher Kip Wells and a game winning three-run home run in the 8th inning of a game on June 16 that gave the Mets a 3–2 win over the Yankees. He hit a memorable 505-foot home run at Shea Stadium (in the middle of the &quot;Bud&quot; sign on the Shea scoreboard) on June 26, and he finished the season with 26 home runs and 72 RBI.

In 2003, he played less than a month before knee problems ended the season for him. In January 2004, he announced that his knee problems would not allow him to play in the upcoming season. Vaughn&#x27;s agent said that Vaughn was not announcing his retirement, but Vaughn acknowledged that he was unlikely to ever play again. At the time of his retirement, Vaughn was one of the two final players to wear the number 42 (and the last position player to do so), the other being Mariano Rivera (who retired in 2013).

==Career statistics==
Over 12 seasons, Vaughn was in 1512 games played, compiling a .293 batting average (1620–5532) with 861 runs, 270 doubles, 328 home runs, 1064 RBI, 725 bases on balls, .383 on-base percentage and .523 slugging percentage. He had five consecutive seasons with a batting average greater than .300 (1994–98). In seven post-season games, he hit .226 (7–31) with 4 runs, 2 home runs and 7 RBI. His career fielding percentage was .988 as a first baseman.

==Personal life==
In July 1995, Vaughn suffered an eye injury as a result of a fight at a Boston nightclub which caused him to miss two games. No charges were filed or arrests made.

In January 1998, Vaughn was arrested and charged with drunk driving after crashing into a disabled car on the side of the road and struggling with field sobriety tests in Norwood, Massachusetts. He was ultimately acquitted after a jury trial in March.

Vaughn is a managing director of OMNI New YorK, LLC, along with Eugene Schneur, which has bought and rehabilitated 1,142 units of distressed housing in the New York metropolitan area. The company also manages these properties to provide low cost housing using government tax credits. He purchased the Noble Drew Ali Plaza in Brownsville, Brooklyn for $21 million, and plans to add massive security upgrades and renovate it.

He has also been involved in refurbishing the Whitney Young Manor in Yonkers, New York, a development first constructed by a company owned by his hero Jackie Robinson. Besides the New York metropolitan area, his company is also involved in projects in Cheyenne, Miami and Las Vegas and has expressed an interest in Boston.

In January 2009, it had been reported by WCVB-TV in Boston that Vaughn had recently committed to investing &quot;$6 million in improvements to the 168-unit Sycamore Village complex that will include new appliances and exterior renovations. Vaughn said his company does not tolerate guns, drugs and criminal behavior. Planning Director Michael Sweeney said Omni&#x27;s purchase is a &#x27;major reinvestment&#x27; in the city&quot; of Lawrence, Massachusetts.

Vaughn lived in Gates Mills, Ohio, and was the president of a trucking company (Mo Vaughn Transport) in Solon. Vaughn sold the company in 2018.

On April 18, 2013, Vaughn bought an advertisement section of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and used it to salute those involved in helping the victims of the April 15, 2013 Patriots Day Bombing in Boston. &quot;You are all heroes in my eyes&quot;, wrote Vaughn, &quot;Boston will march on.&quot;

Vaughn became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received 1.1% of the vote and dropped off the ballot.

==Performance-enhancing drugs==
It was revealed on December 13, 2007, in the report by Senator George J. Mitchell that Vaughn had purchased steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs from Kirk Radomski, who said he delivered the drugs to him personally. Radomski produced three checks, one for $2,200 and two more for $3,200, from Vaughn, one of the latter dated June 1, 2001, and another dated June 19, 2001. Radomski said that the higher checks were for two kits of HGH, while the lower one was for one and a half kits. Vaughn&#x27;s name, address and telephone number were listed in an address book seized from Radomski&#x27;s house by federal agents. Vaughn&#x27;s trainer instructed him to take HGH in attempt to recover from injury.

Mitchell requested a meeting with Vaughn in order to provide Vaughn with the information about these allegations and to give him an opportunity to respond, but Vaughn never agreed to set a meeting.

<doc id="395172" wikidata="Q318200" url="?curid=395172" title="Abe Saperstein">
<text>Abraham Michael Saperstein (; July 4, 1902 – March 15, 1966) was the founder, owner and earliest coach of the Harlem Globetrotters. Saperstein was a leading figure in black basketball and baseball from the 1920s through the 1950s, primarily before those sports were racially integrated.

Saperstein revolutionized the game of basketball and took the Globetrotters from an unknown team touring small farm towns in the Midwestern United States during the height of the Great Depression to a powerhouse that went on to beat the best team in the all-white National Basketball Association. He also introduced the three-point shot, which went on to become a mainstay of modern basketball.

Saperstein was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 and, at , is its shortest male member. In 1979, he was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and 2005 was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Saperstein was born in the East End of London, England, to a Jewish family originally from Łomża, Poland. His family moved from London to Chicago in 1907, when Abe was five years old. They settled just north of the city&#x27;s Jewish area, often called the “Poor Jews&#x27; quarter” because of the many struggling immigrants living there. Saperstein&#x27;s father, Louis, who had been an apprentice tailor in Poland, saw an ad for a tailor on Chicago&#x27;s North Side in a predominantly German, Irish, and Swedish neighborhood. The ad warned “No Jews allowed” so Louis changed his surname to the more German-sounding Schneider, which is German for &quot;tailor&quot;. After buying the business from the owner several years later, Louis dropped the façade and changed the name of the store to Louis Saperstein&#x27;s Tailor Shop.

At age 10, Saperstein discovered a lifelong love of sports, playing basketball at the Wilson Avenue YMCA and second base for a parochial school team, though he attended the public Ravenswood Elementary School. At Lake View High School, he played nine different sports, including baseball, basketball, football, boxing, and track. Saperstein attended the University of Illinois, but dropped out to help support his family. He decided not to follow his father into tailoring. Instead, his dream was to pursue a career in sports, though he realized that his athletic abilities and height were not going to take him far.

Saperstein eventually landed a position working for the Chicago Park District as a playground supervisor at Welles Park, on Chicago&#x27;s North Side. There, after hours of watching kids play basketball, he decided to create his own team, the Chicago Reds. The Chicago Reds were a semi-pro lightweight (135 lb limit) basketball team, and Saperstein played point guard.

As player, manager, and coach of the Chicago Reds, Saperstein met Walter Thomas Ball, a legendary baseball player in the Negro leagues, who had a black baseball team he wanted to send on tour in Illinois and southern Wisconsin. He hired Saperstein as his booking agent.

==Harlem Globetrotters career==
Saperstein went on to become booking agent for several basketball teams as well, until branching out in the late 1920s to form his own team with some of the members of the Savoy Big Five. He called the team the New York Harlem Globetrotters. Although Saperstein&#x27;s team had nothing to do with Harlem (they wouldn&#x27;t play there until 1968), he chose the name to indicate that the players were black, as Harlem was the epicenter of African-American culture. Many of the towns where the Globetrotters played in their first few years were all white, and Saperstein did not want other teams or spectators to be surprised that his team was black.

The Globetrotters played their first game in Hinckley, Illinois. The team netted a grand total of $8, which was split evenly among the six members of the team, including Saperstein. Over the next several years, in the midst of the Great Depression, Saperstein served as the team&#x27;s coach, driver, booking agent, PR director, and occasional substitute player. When a player was injured in a 1926 game, for example, Saperstein substituted into the game, prompting the Winona (Minnesota) News to report: &quot;Four clean-limbed young colored men and a squat bandy-legged chap of Jewish extraction ... styled the Harlem Globetrotters, beat the Arcadia Military police ... 29 to 18.&quot;

During the early seasons, the Globetrotters needed to play every night just to make ends meet, because the team often netted less than $50 a night. Accommodations on the road were sparse and hotels often would not allow blacks. On one occasion, when the players could not find a hotel in Des Moines, Iowa, they sneaked up the fire escape and slept in Saperstein&#x27;s room. Saperstein was relentless in booking games; in the team&#x27;s first seven years, the Globetrotters played more than 1,000 games, with Saperstein driving the players to tiny towns throughout the Midwest in his unheated Ford Model T.

From early on, the Globetrotters blended basketball with showmanship and ball-handling wizardry, but they were also extremely talented basketball players, winning most of their games. In 1940, the Globetrotters beat the legendary black basketball team, the New York Renaissance.

An even bigger achievement came a few years later in the 1948 Globetrotters–Lakers game, when the Globetrotters defeated the Minneapolis Lakers, the best team in the all-white NBA, a league that had been formed two years earlier. The star of the Lakers was six-foot-ten George Mikan, nicknamed &quot;Mr. Basketball.&quot; Despite the Lakers&#x27; significant height advantage and the team&#x27;s billing as the best basketball team in the country, the underdog Globetrotters won the game 61–59, thanks to a dramatic long shot at the buzzer by Globetrotter Ermer Robinson. Afterward, in the locker room, the players hoisted Saperstein triumphantly on their shoulders.

The Globetrotters-Lakers game had taken place amid a sharp racial divide in sports. Many fans and team owners believed that black athletes were not coachable or intelligent enough to learn complicated plays, and lacked the competitive fire necessary for premier athletes. The victory, which was just shy of the Globetrotters&#x27; 3,000th victory in 21 seasons, proved that none of this was true and that African-American players had the skill and ability to play in the professional leagues.

In 1950, within two years of the Globetrotters-Lakers&#x27; game, the NBA integrated. Chuck Cooper, who had been a Globetrotter briefly, became the first black player to sign a contract with the NBA. Another two of the first black NBA players also were Globetrotters – Nat &quot;Sweetwater&quot; Clifton and Hank DeZonie.

Also in 1950, the Globetrotters played their first game in Madison Square Garden, marking the first time the venue sold out for a basketball game. Following these successes, interest in the Globetrotters grew and Saperstein created two more teams in the United States, as well as an international squad. The Globetrotters have now played in more than 123 countries and territories across the planet.

Even after the NBA integrated, top black players continued to play for the Globetrotters. In 1958, Wilt Chamberlain joined the Globetrotters for a year before going to the NBA and becoming its most dominant player. In a 1999 interview, Wilt Chamberlain said, &quot;The fraternity of the Globetrotters was one of the most rewarding times of my life. I almost did not go into the NBA.&quot;

Two feature-length movies have been made about the Globetrotters, &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters&quot; (1951) and &quot;Go, Man, Go&quot; (1954), the latter starring Dane Clark and Sidney Poitier. Several documentaries have also told the Globetrotters&#x27; story, including &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters: The Team That Changed the World&quot; (2005), which featured Geese Ausbie, Larry Brown and Bill Bradley.

==Innovation of the three-point rule==
Saperstein had ambitions of owning a team in the National Basketball Association and hoped to start a team in California. That hope was dashed when the NBA approved the move of the Lakers from Minneapolis to L.A. Saperstein was also denied ownership of the Warriors when the team moved from Philadelphia to San Francisco. Instead of sitting on the sidelines, Saperstein started the American Basketball League (ABL) in 1961 and served as its commissioner, as well as owner of the league&#x27;s Chicago Majors team. To differentiate the ABL from the NBA – and to promote the new league – Saperstein introduced several innovations that have endured as features of modern basketball. He widened the free throw lane to 18 feet (from 12) and created the three-point shot. As commissioner of the short-lived ABL, Saperstein wanted a way to add excitement to the game and provide players with additional challenges. He hoped the three-pointer would become basketball&#x27;s equivalent of the home run. &quot;We must have a weapon,&quot; Saperstein said, &quot;and this is ours.&quot;

To determine the distance the new shot line should be from the basket, Abe Saperstein and longtime DePaul University coach Ray Meyer went onto a court one day with tape and selected 25 feet as the right length. &quot;They just arbitrarily drew lines,&quot; his son Jerry Saperstein said. &quot;There&#x27;s really no scientific basis. Just two Hall of Fame coaches getting together and saying: &#x27;Where would we like to see the line?&#x27;&quot; Not long after, in June 1961, Saperstein was traveling when the other seven ABL owners voted, 4–3, to officially shorten the line to 22 feet. Saperstein, who had significant power in the league as owner of the popular Globetrotters, disagreed with this and simply ignored the ruling. Games continued with the 25-foot shot. Saperstein eventually acknowledged there was one problem with the 25-foot arc and solved it by adding a 22-foot line in the corners. &quot;It made for interesting possibilities,&quot; he wrote.

After the ABL shut down in 1963, the American Basketball Association made the three-pointer a central part of its image, creating enough competition for the NBA that the two leagues merged in 1976. The NBA adopted the shot in 1979. In 1994, it was moved to 22 feet, then changed back three seasons later, where it has stayed ever since.

==Other sports teams==
Saperstein was a leading figure in the black baseball leagues. At various times, he owned the Chicago Brown Bombers, the Birmingham Black Barons, and the Cincinnati Crescents baseball teams. He also created several new leagues, including the Negro Midwest League and, in partnership with Olympic track and field star Jesse Owens, the West Coast Negro Baseball League.

When Saperstein&#x27;s friend Bill Veeck took ownership of the Cleveland Indians in the late 1940s, he hired Saperstein as his chief scout for African-American players. At Saperstein&#x27;s suggestion, Veeck eventually signed Luke Easter, Minnie Minoso, Suitcase Simpson, Satchel Paige, and Larry Doby, the American League&#x27;s first black player.

Saperstein also founded the white New York Nationals baseball team and the Boston Brownskins, a basketball team that served as a minor league club for the Globetrotters. He also booked games for the Hong Wah Kues, a basketball team of Chinese Americans from San Francisco. Started in 1939 with six players, the Hong Wah Kues became known for their speed and quick passing. They played the Harlem Globetrotters once, and lost.

== Legacy ==
In a time of racial segregation and bigotry in professional sports, Saperstein proudly showcased the talents of the nation&#x27;s best black basketball players. Four years after the all-white National Basketball Association (originally called the Basketball Association of America) was formed, black players were finally allowed into the league.

As the integrated NBA became recognized as the country&#x27;s highest level of basketball, Saperstein focused the Globetrotters on entertainment, creating a popular act that played to audiences worldwide. In the years following World War II, the Globetrotters embarked on a “goodwill tour.” Among the more memorable of those games took place in Berlin&#x27;s Olympic Stadium and featured Jesse Owens, who was traveling with the team. Owens returned to the stadium where he had won four gold medals 15 years earlier, after which Hitler famously refused to shake his hand.

Although Saperstein worried about bringing the team into the racially charged atmosphere of Berlin, Owens and the Globetrotters were greeted by 75,000 cheering fans. The mayor of Berlin greeted Owens and famously said, &quot;In 1936, Hitler refused to shake your hand. Today, I give you both of mine.&quot;

As the movement for civil rights progressed, some alleged that Saperstein did not do enough to advance the equality of his black players. In the 50s and 60s, some players resented that, due to the prejudice of hotel owners, they continued to be housed in &quot;colored&quot; hotels in black neighborhoods, while players on Saperstein&#x27;s white teams supposedly stayed in first-class hotels. There was also discontent among some Globetrotters that Saperstein reportedly paid white players on his other teams higher salaries. Others criticized the Globetrotters for their on-court antics, saying they played into racial stereotypes. In 1978, however, Jesse Jackson said: &quot;They did not show blacks as stupid. On the contrary, they were shown as superior…they were able to turn science into an art form.&quot; Meadowlark Lemon, who played with the Globetrotters from 1954 until 1979, also came to the Globetrotters&#x27;s defense, saying that the team had &quot;done more for the perception of black people, and the perception of America, than almost anything you could think of.&quot;

In 1999, the City of Chicago erected a historical marker dedicated to Saperstein in front of the home he lived in at 3828 N. Hermitage Ave. in the Lakeview neighborhood.

== Personal life ==

Saperstein was the eldest of nine children, several of whom were involved with the Globetrotters. In the early years, Saperstein&#x27;s then-teenage brother Harry worked as a typist and secretary, sending out press releases and game schedules. His sister Fay, the youngest sibling, helped Abe with paperwork for years and ran the New York office in the 1950s. After Abe&#x27;s death in March 1966, his brother Morry Saperstein assisted in running the business before it was sold to a group of Chicago businessmen for $3.7 million and eventually moved from Chicago to New York City.

On May 6, 1934, Saperstein married Sylvia Franklin from Chicago. They had two children, Jerry and Eloise. Jerry ran the international unit of the Globetrotters in the 1960s, founded the New York Sets, a charter franchise of World Team Tennis, and owned the San Francisco Shamrocks of the Pacific Hockey League. He then served as the first vice president at Madison Square Garden Corporation, reporting directly to the then-Chairman Sonny Werblin. Jerry died on November 16, 2021, two days after his 81st birthday. Jerry is survived by his two sons, Adam and Lanier Saperstein, and his daughter Sara Chana (Simone) Silverstein. They all live in the New York area. Lanier is a partner in the law firm of Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP. Eloise established a non-profit organization, the Abe Saperstein Foundation, designed to advance opportunities through sports for Chicago&#x27;s youth, and she also was the first woman ever certified as an NBA player representative. She died on July 15, 2018, at the age of 81. Eloise is survived by her three children, Lonni, Avi and Abra, who live in the Chicago area.

Saperstein was a tireless worker, taking off just one day a year, Yom Kippur. He continued to work right up until his death from a heart attack in March 1966. &quot;He had more energy than the Grand Coulee Dam,&quot; wrote Chuck Menville in &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters: An Illustrated History&quot;. The news of Saperstein&#x27;s death came as a shock to the Globetrotters. The team&#x27;s star, Meadowlark Lemon, was on the road in Charlotte, North Carolina at the time. &quot;My mouth went dry,&quot; Lemon said. &quot;The boys cried. I had to force myself to be funny. I did it only because Abe would have wanted the show to go on.&quot; Saperstein is buried in the Westlawn Cemetery in Norridge, Illinois, near Chicago.

<text>The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, usually referred to as simply the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, was a U.S. government agency of early post American Civil War Reconstruction, assisting freedmen (i.e., former slaves) in the South. It was established on March 3, 1865, and operated briefly as a federal agency after the War, from 1865 to November 1872, to direct provisions, clothing, and fuel for the immediate and temporary shelter and supply of destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen and their wives and children.

==Background and operations==
In 1863, the American Freedmen&#x27;s Inquiry Commission was established. Two years later, as a result of the inquiry the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau Bill was passed, which established the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau as initiated by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. It was intended to last for one year after the end of the Civil War. The Bureau became a part of the United States Department of War, as Congress provided no funding for it. The War Department was the only agency with funds the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau could use and which had an existing presence in the South.

Headed by Union Army General Oliver O. Howard, the Bureau started operations in 1865. From the beginning, its representatives found its tasks very difficult, in part because Southern legislatures passed Black Codes that restricted movement, conditions of labor, and other civil rights of African Americans, nearly replicating the conditions of slavery. Also, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau only controlled a limited amount of arable land.

The Bureau&#x27;s powers were expanded to help African Americans find family members from whom they had become separated during the war. It arranged to teach them to read and write—skills considered critical by the freedmen themselves as well as by the government. Bureau agents also served as legal advocates for African Americans in both state and federal courts, mostly in cases dealing with family issues. The Bureau encouraged former major planters to rebuild their plantations and pay wages to their previously enslaved workers. It kept an eye on the contracts between the newly free laborers and planters, given that few freedmen had yet gained adequate reading skills, and pushed whites and blacks to work together in a free-labor market as employers and employees rather than as masters and slaves.
In 1866 Congress renewed the charter for the Bureau. President Andrew Johnson, a Southern Democrat who had succeeded to the office following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination in 1865, vetoed the bill, arguing that the Bureau encroached on states&#x27; rights, relied inappropriately on the military in peacetime, gave blacks help that poor whites had never had, and would ultimately prevent freed slaves from becoming self-sufficient by rendering them dependent on public assistance. Though the 39th United States Congress—controlled by Radical Republicans—overrode Johnson&#x27;s veto, by 1869 Southern Democrats in Congress had deprived the Bureau of most of its funding, and as a result it had to cut much of its staff. By 1870 the Bureau had been weakened further due to the rise of Ku Klux Klan (KKK) violence across the South; members of the KKK and other terrorist organizations, attacked both blacks and sympathetic white Republicans, including teachers. Northern Democrats also opposed the Bureau&#x27;s work, painting it as a program that would make African Americans &quot;lazy&quot;.

In 1872 Congress abruptly abandoned the program, refusing to approve renewal legislation. It did not inform Howard, whom U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had transferred to Arizona to settle hostilities between the Apache and settlers. Grant&#x27;s Secretary of War William W. Belknap was hostile to Howard&#x27;s leadership and authority at the Bureau. Belknap aroused controversy among Republicans by his reassignment of Howard.

==Achievements==

===Day-to-day duties===
The Bureau mission was to help solve everyday problems of the newly freed slaves, such as obtaining food, medical care, communication with family members, and jobs. Between 1865 and 1869, it distributed 15 million rations of food to freed African Americans and 5 million rations to impoverished whites, and set up a system by which planters could borrow rations in order to feed freedmen they employed. Although the Bureau set aside $350,000 for this latter service, only $35,000 (10%) was borrowed by planters.

The Bureau&#x27;s humanitarian efforts had limited success. Medical treatment of the freedmen was severely deficient, as few Southern doctors, all of whom were white, would treat them. Much infrastructure had been destroyed by the war, and people had few means of improving sanitation. Blacks had little opportunity to become medical personnel. Travelers unknowingly carried epidemics of cholera and yellow fever along the river corridors, which broke out across the South and caused many fatalities, especially among the poor.

===Gender roles===

Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau agents initially complained that freedwomen were refusing to contract their labor. One of the first actions black families took for independence was to withdraw women&#x27;s labor from fieldwork. The Bureau attempted to force freedwomen to work by insisting that their husbands sign contracts making the whole family available as field labor in the cotton industry, and by declaring that unemployed freedwomen should be treated as vagrants just as black men were. The Bureau did allow some exceptions, such as married women with employed husbands, and some &quot;worthy&quot; women who had been widowed or abandoned and had large families of small children to care for. Women considered &quot;unworthy&quot; by the Bureau, were often penalized.

Before the Civil War the enslaved could not marry legally, and most marriages had been informal, although planters often presided over &quot;marriage&quot; ceremonies for their enslaved. After the war, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau performed numerous marriages for freed couples who asked for it. As many husbands, wives, and children had been forcibly separated under slavery, the Bureau agents helped families reunite after the war. The Bureau had an informal regional communications system that allowed agents to send inquiries and provide answers. It sometimes provided transportation to reunite families. Freedmen and freedwomen turned to the Bureau for assistance in resolving issues of abandonment and divorce.

===Education===
The most widely recognized accomplishments of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau were in education. Prior to the Civil War, no Southern state had a system of universal, state-supported public education; in addition, most had prohibited both enslaved and free blacks from gaining an education. This meant learning to read and write, and do simple arithmetic. Former slaves wanted public education while the wealthier whites opposed the idea. Freedmen had a strong desire to learn to read and write; some had already started schools at refugee camps; others worked hard to establish schools in their communities even prior to the advent of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau schools were also open to poor whites, but almost no whites attended because &quot;Despite the absence of statewide systems in most Southern states, most parents preferred to consign their children to illiteracy rather than to see them educated alongside black children.&quot;

Oliver Otis Howard was appointed as the first Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau Commissioner. Through his leadership, the bureau set up four divisions: Government-Controlled Lands, Records, Financial Affairs, and Medical Affairs. Education was considered part of the Records division. Howard turned over confiscated property including planters&#x27; mansions, government buildings, books, and furniture to superintendents to be used in the education of freedmen. He provided transportation and room and board for teachers. Many Northerners came south to educate freedmen.
By 1866, Northern missionary and aid societies worked in conjunction with the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau to provide education for former slaves. The American Missionary Association (AMA) was particularly active, establishing eleven &quot;colleges&quot; in Southern states for the education of freedmen. The primary focus of these groups was to raise funds to pay teachers and manage schools, while the secondary focus was the day-to-day operation of individual schools. After 1866, Congress appropriated some funds to operate the freedmen&#x27;s schools. The main source of educational revenue for these schools came through a Congressional Act that gave the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau the power to seize Confederate property for educational use.

George Ruby, an African American, served as a teacher and school administrator and as a traveling inspector for the Bureau, observing local conditions, aiding in the establishment of black schools, and evaluating the performance of Bureau field officers. Blacks supported him, but planters and other whites opposed him.

Overall, the Bureau spent $5 million to set up schools for blacks. By the end of 1865, more than 90,000 former slaves were enrolled as students in such public schools. Attendance rates at the new schools for freedmen were about 80%. Brigadier General Samuel Chapman Armstrong created and led Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in Virginia in 1868. It is now known as Hampton University.

The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau published their own freedmen&#x27;s textbook. They emphasized the bootstrap philosophy, encouraging freedmen to believe that each person had the ability to work hard and to do better in life. These readers included traditional literacy lessons, as well as selections on the life and works of Abraham Lincoln, excerpts from the Bible focused on forgiveness, biographies of famous African Americans with emphasis on their piety, humbleness, and industry; and essays on humility, the work ethic, temperance, loving one&#x27;s enemies, and avoiding bitterness.

J. W. Alvord, an inspector for the Bureau, wrote that the freedmen &quot;have the natural thirst for knowledge,&quot; aspire to &quot;power and influence … coupled with learning,&quot; and are excited by &quot;the special study of books.&quot; Among the former slaves, both children and adults sought this new opportunity to learn. After the Bureau was abolished, some of its achievements collapsed under the weight of white violence against schools and teachers for blacks. Most Reconstruction-era legislatures had established public education but, after the 1870s, when white Democrats regained power of Southern governments, they reduced funds available to fund public education, particularly for blacks. Beginning in 1890 in Mississippi, Democratic-dominated legislatures in the South passed new state constitutions disenfranchising most blacks by creating barriers to voter registration. They then passed Jim Crow laws establishing legal segregation of public places. Segregated schools and other services for blacks were consistently underfunded by the Southern legislatures.

By 1871, Northerners&#x27; interest in reconstructing the South had waned. Northerners were beginning to tire of the effort that Reconstruction required, were discouraged by the high rate of continuing violence around elections, and were ready for the South to take care of itself. All of the Southern states had created new constitutions that established universal, publicly funded education. Groups based in the North began to redirect their money toward universities and colleges founded to educate African-American leaders.

==Teachers==

Written accounts by northern women and missionary societies resulted in historians&#x27; overestimating their influence, writing that most Bureau teachers were well-educated women from the North, motivated by religion and abolitionism to teach in the South. In the early 21st century, new research has found that half the teachers were southern whites; one-third were blacks (mostly southern), and one-sixth were northern whites. Few were abolitionists; few came from New England. Men outnumbered women. The salary was the strongest motivation except for the northerners, who were typically funded by northern organizations and had a humanitarian motivation. As a group, the black cohort showed the greatest commitment to racial equality; and they were the ones most likely to remain teachers. The school curriculum resembled that of schools in the north.

===Colleges===
The building and opening by the AMA and other missionary societies of schools of higher learning for African Americans coincided with the shift in focus for the Freedmen&#x27;s Aid Societies from supporting an elementary education for all African Americans to enabling African-American leaders to gain high school and college educations. Some white officials working with African Americans in the South were concerned about what they considered the lack of a moral or financial foundation seen in the African-American community and traced that lack of foundation back to slavery.

Generally, they believed that Blacks needed help to enter a free labor market and rebuild a stable family life. Heads of local American Missionary Associations sponsored various educational and religious efforts for African Americans. Later efforts for higher education were supported by such leaders as Samuel Chapman Armstrong of the Hampton Institute and Booker T. Washington of the Tuskegee Institute (from 1881). They said that black students should be able to leave home and &quot;live in an atmosphere conducive not only to scholarship but to culture and refinement&quot;.

Most of these colleges, universities and normal schools combined what they believed were the best fundamentals of a college with that of the home, giving students a basic structure to build acceptable practices of upstanding lives. At many of these institutions, Christian principles and practices were also part of the daily regime.

===Educational legacy===
Despite the untimely dissolution of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, its legacy influenced the important historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), which were the chief institutions of higher learning for blacks in the South through the decades of segregation into the mid-20th century. Under the direction and sponsorship of the Bureau, together with the American Missionary Association in many cases, from approximately 1866 until its termination in 1872, an estimated 25 institutions of higher learning for black youth were established. The leaders among them continue to operate as highly ranked institutions in the 21st century and have seen increasing enrollment. (Examples of HBCUs include Howard University, St. Augustine&#x27;s College, Fisk University, Johnson C. Smith University, Clark Atlanta University, Dillard University, Shaw University, Virginia Union University, and Tougaloo College).

, there exist approximately 105 HBCUs that range in scope, size, organization, and orientation. Under the Education Act of 1965, Congress officially defined an HBCU as &quot;an institution whose principal missions were and are the education of Black Americans&quot;. HBCUs graduate over 50% of African-American professionals, 50% of African-American public school teachers, and 70% of African-American dentists. In addition, 50% of African Americans who graduate from HBCUs pursue graduate or professional degrees. One in three degrees held by African Americans in the natural sciences, and half the degrees held by African Americans in mathematics, were earned at HBCUs.

Perhaps the best known of these institutions is Howard University, founded in Washington, D.C., in 1867, with the aid of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. It was named for the commissioner of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, General Oliver Otis Howard.

===Church establishment===
After the Civil War, control over existing churches was a contentious issue. The Methodist denomination had split into regional associations in the 1840s prior to the war, as had the Baptists, when Southern Baptists were founded. In some cities, Northern Methodists seized control of Southern Methodist buildings. Numerous northern denominations, including the independent black denominations of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) and African Methodist Episcopal Zion, sent missionaries to the South to help the freedmen and plant new congregations. By this time the independent black denominations were increasingly well organized and prepared to evangelize to the freedmen. Within a decade, the AME and AME Zion churches had gained hundreds of thousands of new members and were rapidly organizing new congregations.

Even before the war, blacks had established independent Baptist congregations in some cities and towns, such as Silver Bluff and Charleston, South Carolina; and Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. In many places, especially in more rural areas, they shared public services with whites. Often enslaved blacks met secretly to conduct their own services away from white supervision or oversight. After the war, freedmen mostly withdrew from the white-dominated congregations of the Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches in order to be free of white supervision. Within a short time, they were organizing black Baptist state associations and organized a national association in the 1890s.

Northern mission societies raised funds for land, buildings, teachers&#x27; salaries, and basic necessities such as books and furniture. For years they used networks throughout their churches to raise money for freedmen&#x27;s education and worship.

==Continuing insurgency==

Most of the assistant commissioners, realizing that African Americans would not receive fair trials in the civil courts, tried to handle black cases in their own Bureau courts. Southern whites objected that this was unconstitutional. In Alabama, the Bureau commissioned state and county judges as Bureau agents. They were to try cases involving blacks with no distinctions on racial grounds. If a judge refused, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau could institute martial law in his district. All but three judges accepted their unwanted commissions, and the governor urged compliance.

Perhaps the most difficult region reported by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau was Louisiana&#x27;s Caddo and Bossier parishes in the northwest part of the state. It had not suffered wartime devastation or Union occupation, but white hostility was high against the black majority population. Well-meaning Bureau agents were understaffed and weakly supported by federal troops, and found their investigations blocked and authority undermined at every turn by recalcitrant plantation owners. Murders of freedmen were common, and white suspects in these cases were not prosecuted. Bureau agents did negotiate labor contracts, build schools and hospitals, and aid freedmen, but they struggled against the violence of the oppressive environment.

In addition to internal parish problems, this area was reportedly invaded by insurgents from Arkansas, described as Desperadoes by the Bureau agent in 1868. In September 1868, for example, whites arrested and convicted 21 blacks accused of planning an insurrection in Bossier Parish. Henry Jones, accused of being the leader of the purported insurrection, was shot and left to burn by whites, but he survived, badly hurt. Other freedmen were killed or driven from their land by Arkansas Desperadoes. Whites were anxious about their power as blacks were to receive the franchise, and tensions were rising over land use. In early October, blacks arrested two whites from Arkansas &quot;accused of being part of a mob ... that killed several Negroes.&quot; The agent reported 14 blacks had been killed in this incident, then said that another eight to ten had been killed by the same Desperadoes. Blacks were reported to have killed the two white men in the altercation. The whites&#x27; Arkansas friends and local whites went on a rampage against blacks in the area, resulting in more than 150 blacks being killed.

In March 1872, at the request of President Ulysses S. Grant and the Secretary of the Interior, Columbus Delano, General Howard was asked to temporarily leave his duties as Commissioner of the Bureau to deal with Indian affairs in the west. Upon returning from his assignment in November 1872, General Howard discovered that the Bureau and all of its activities had been officially terminated by Congress, effective as of June. While General Howard was dealing with Indian affairs in the west, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau was steadily losing its support in Congress. President Johnson had opposed the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and his attitude encouraged many people, especially white Southerners, to challenge the Bureau. But insurgents showed that the war had not ended, as armed whites attacked black Republicans and their sympathizers, including teachers and officeholders. Congress dismantled the Bureau in 1872 due to pressure from white Southerners. The Bureau was unable to change much of the social dynamic as whites continued to seek supremacy over blacks, frequently with violence.

In his autobiography, General Howard expressed great frustration about Congress having closed down the bureau. He said, &quot;the legislative action, however, was just what I desired, except that I would have preferred to close out my own Bureau and not have another do it for me in an unfriendly manner in my absence.&quot; All documents and matters pertaining to the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau were transferred from the office of General Howard to the War Department of the United States Congress.

==State programs==

===Alabama===
The Bureau began distributing rations in the summer of 1865. Drought conditions resulted in so much need that the state established its own Office of the Commissioner of the Destitute to provide additional relief. The two agencies coordinated their efforts starting in 1866. The Bureau established depots in eight major cities. Counties were allocated aid in kind each month based on the number of poor reported. The counties were required to provide transportation from the depots for the supplies. The ration was larger in winter and spring, and reduced in seasons when locally grown food was available.

In 1866, the depot at Huntsville provided five thousand rations a day. The food was distributed without regard to race. Corruption and abuse was so great that in October 1866, President Johnson ended in-kind aid in that state. One hundred twenty thousand dollars was given to the state to provide relief to the end of January 1867. Aid was ended in the state. Records show that by the end of the program, four times as many White people received aid than did Black people.

===Florida===
The Florida Bureau was assessed to be working effectively. Thomas Ward Osborne, the assistant commissioner of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau for Florida, was an astute politician who collaborated with the leadership of both parties in the state. He was warmly praised by observers on all sides. In an annual report dated October 1, 1866, it was reported that the Bureau had appointed twenty-four civilian &quot;special agents&quot; to assist the eighteen military officers who were already serving as Sub-assistant Commissioners.

===Georgia===
The Bureau played a major role in Georgia politics. It was especially active in setting up, monitoring, and enforcing labor contracts for both men and women. It also set up a new system of healthcare for the freedmen. Although a majority of the agency&#x27;s relief rations went to freedpeople, a large number of whites also benefited. In Georgia, poor whites received almost one-fifth of the Bureau&#x27;s rations.
===North Carolina===
In North Carolina, the bureau employed: 9 contract surgeons, at $100 per month; 26 hospital attendants, at average pay each per month $11.25; 18 civilian employees, clerks, agents, etc., at an average pay per month of $17.20; 4 laborers, at an average pay per month of $11.90, for a total annual salaries of $18,596.40, which is approximately $595,000 in 2024 dollars; enlisted men are detailed as orderlies, guards, etc., by commanding officers of the different military posts where officers of the Bureau were serving.
Some misconduct was reported to the bureau main office that bureau agents were using their posts for personal gains. Colonel E. Whittlesey was questioned but said he was not involved in nor knew of anyone involved in such activities. The bureau exercised what whites believed were arbitrary powers: making arrests, imposing fines, and inflicting punishments. They were considered to be disregarding the local laws and especially the statute of limitations. Their activities resulted in resentment among whites toward the federal government in general. These powers invoked negative feelings in many southerners that sparked many to want the agency to leave. In their review, Steedman and Fullerton repeated their conclusion from Virginia, which was to withdraw the Bureau and turn daily operations over to the military.

===South Carolina===
In South Carolina, the bureau employed nine clerks, at average pay each per month $108.33, one rental agent, at monthly pay of $75.00, one clerk, at monthly pay of $50.00, one storekeeper, at monthly pay of $85.00, one counselor, at monthly pay of $125.00, one superintendent of education, at monthly pay of $150.00, one printer, at monthly pay of $100.00, one contract surgeon, at monthly pay of $100.00, and twenty-five laborers, at average pay per month $19.20. Total annual salaries of $25,679.64 which is $821,600 in 2024 dollars.
General Saxton was head of the bureau operations in South Carolina; he was reported by Steedman and Fullerton to have made so many &quot;mistakes and blunders&quot; that he made matters worse for the freedmen. He was replaced by Brigadier General R. K. Scott. Steedman and Fullerton described Scott as energetic and a competent officer. It appeared that he took great pains to turn things around and correct the mistakes made by his predecessors.
The investigators learned of reported murders of freedmen by a band of outlaws. These outlaws were thought to be people from other states, such as Texas, Kentucky and Tennessee, who had been part of the rebel army (Ku Klux Klan chapters were similarly started by veterans in the first years after the war.) When citizens were asked why the perpetrators had not been arrested, many answered that the Bureau, with the support of the military, had the primary authority.
In certain areas, such as the Sea Islands, many freedmen were destitute. Many had tried to cultivate the land and began businesses with little to no success in the social disruption of the period.

===Texas===
Suffering much less damage in the war than some other Deep South states, Texas became a destination for some 200,000 refugee blacks from other parts of the South, in addition to 200,000 already in Texas. Slavery had been prevalent only in East Texas, and some freedmen hoped for the chance of new types of opportunity in the lightly populated but booming state. The Bureau&#x27;s political role was central, as was close attention to the need for schools.

===Virginia===
The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau had 58 clerks and superintendents of farms, paid average monthly wages $78.50; 12 assistant superintendents, paid average monthly wages 87.00; and 163 laborers, paid average monthly wages 11.75; as personnel in the state of Virginia. Other personnel included orderlies and guards.

During the war, slaves had escaped to Union lines and forts in the Tidewater, where contraband camps were established. Many stayed in that area after the war, seeking protection near the federal forts. The Bureau fed 9,000 to 10,000 blacks a month over the winter, explaining:
:&quot;A majority of the freedmen to whom this subsistence has been furnished are undoubtedly able to earn a living if they were removed to localities where labor could be procured. The necessity for issuing rations to this class of persons results from their accumulation in large numbers in certain places where the land is unproductive and the demand for labor is limited. As long as these people remain in the present localities, the civil authorities refuse to provide for the able-bodied, and are unable to care for the helpless and destitute among them, owing to their great number and the fact that very few are residents of the counties in which they have congregated during the war. The necessity for the relief extended to these people, both able-bodied and helpless, by the Government, will continue as long as they remain in their present condition, and while rations are issued to the able-bodied they will not voluntarily change their localities to seek places where they can procure labor.&#x27;

==Bureau records==
In 2000, the U.S. Congress passed the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau Preservation Act, which directed the National Archivist to preserve the extensive records of the Bureau on microfilm, and work with educational institutions to index the records. In addition to those records of the Bureau headquarters, assistant commissioners, and superintendents of education, the National Archives now has records of the field offices, marriage records, and records of the Freedmen&#x27;s Branch of the Adjutant General on microfilm. They are being digitized and made available through online databases. These constitute a major source of documentation on the operations of the Bureau, political and social conditions in the Reconstruction Era, and the genealogies of freedpeople.
The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau Project (announced on June 19, 2015) was created as a set of partnerships between FamilySearch International and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society (AAHGS), and the California African American Museum. With the help of more than 25,000 volunteers, the project was completed on June 20, 2016. Information about millions of African Americans is now accessible, allowing families to build their family trees and connect with their ancestors.

In October 2006, Virginia governor Tim Kaine announced that Virginia would be the first state to index and digitize Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau records.

<text>The Łyna (; ; ; - &quot;Lava&quot;), is a river that begins in northern Poland&#x27;s Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship and ends in Russia&#x27;s Kaliningrad Oblast.

The Łyna is a tributary of the Pregolya River, and has a total length of 264 km (207 km in Poland and 57 km in Russia) and a basin area of 7,126 km² (5,298 km² in Poland). It is connected to Lake Mamry by the 18th-century Masurian Canal.

The river&#x27;s source is located near the village of Łyna in Masuria, Poland. It then flows through the regions of Warmia, Bartia and Nadrovia.
==History==
In historical terms, the river fell within the area of the medieval Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights established in the 13th century. In 1454, the adjacent territory was incorporated by King Casimir IV Jagiellon to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. It was confirmed as part of Poland after the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War, the longest of all Polish–Teutonic wars, ended in 1466. Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the area was annexed by Prussia and made part of the newly formed province of East Prussia in 1773, which from 1871 was also part of Germany. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, in 1945, it was split between Poland and the Soviet Union in accordance with border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference.

==Cities and towns==
The largest city located on the Łyna is Olsztyn, Poland. Cities and towns along the Łyna include:

<text>The Bóbr (, , ) is a river which carries water through the north of the Czech Republic and the southwest of Poland. It is a left tributary of the Oder. Its Polish name translates directly to &#x27;beaver&#x27;.

==Course==
The Bóbr has a length of (3 in Czech Republic, 276 in Poland, 10th longest Polish river) and a basin area of (44 in Czech Republic and 5,830 in Poland). It originates on a slope of the Rýchory mountains in the southeast of the Krkonoše range. The source is located near the small Bobr village of the Žacléř municipality in the Czech Hradec Králové Region. Parallel to the Lusatian Neisse tributary of the Oder in the west, it flows northwards from the Bohemian region into adjacent Silesia.

Shortly after the river crosses the border to Polish Niedamirów and runs northwestwards through the Jelenia Góra valley of the Western Sudetes to the dam of Pilchowice and downhill into the plains of Lower Silesia, passing the towns of Jelenia Góra, Bolesławiec, Szprotawa, and Żagań, where the parallel Kwisa river joins it. The river finally flows into the Oder near the town of Krosno. Non-navigable for its entire length, it is a popular destination for canoeing.

==History==

Since the Middle Ages the lower Bóbr river north of Żagań and the Kwisa confluence marked the border between the historic regions of Silesia in the east and Lower Lusatia to the west. After in 937 King Otto I of Germany had established the Saxon Eastern March on the lands settled by Polabian Slavs, Margrave Gero until 963 subdued the Lusatian lands up to the border with Poland (&quot;Civitas Schinesghe&quot;). Upon Gero&#x27;s death in 965, the river was the designated eastern border of the newly created March of Lusatia in the Holy Roman Empire.

The Polish territorial sovereignty was acknowledged to Duke Bolesław I Chrobry by Emperor Otto III at the Congress of Gniezno in 1000. Nevertheless, Bolesław laid claims to the lands west of the Bóbr, which he temporarily acquired by the 1018 Treaty of Bautzen. After Emperor Conrad II had reconquered the territory until 1031, the &quot;status quo&quot; was restored. 

The river became an internal border, when the Luxembourg king John of Bohemia step-by-step vassalized the Piast dukes of Silesia and incorporated their lands with the consent of King Casimir III of Poland by the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin, whereafter both Lusatia in the west and Silesia in the east became Lands of the Bohemian Crown.

During the Potsdam Conference in 1945, the Western Allies briefly advocated a Polish-German border along the Oder, Bóbr and Kwisa rivers, but were rejected by Joseph Stalin, who had already committed himself to the Oder-Neisse line.

==Bóbr dam==
The Pilchowice Dam (, German: &quot;Talsperre Mauer&quot;) was built from 1904 to 1912 in the northern Krkonoše range near Jelenia Góra. Then the largest in Europe, surpassing even the Urft Dam built in 1905, it created a reservoir of about length. 

The masonry structure was erected on a Gneiss basis according to the Intze Principle. Equipped with Francis turbines manufactured by Voith and Siemens-Schuckert and AEG generators, the hydroelectric plant supplies about 20,000,000 kWh a year, with a power rating of 7,585 kW.

== Protections ==
Parts of the Bóbr river valley is protected area in some form or another, and the river itself originates from the Krkonoše National Park in Czech Republic, close to the border with Poland. Protections in the Bóbr valley area include:
* Rudawy Landscape Park
* Bóbr Valley Landscape Park
* Przemków Landscape Park

<text>The Wieprz (, ; ) is a river in central-eastern Poland, and a tributary of the Vistula. It is the country&#x27;s ninth longest river, with a total length of 349 km and a catchment area of 10,497 km2, all within Poland. Its course near the town of Łęczna includes the protected area known as Wieprz Landscape Park.

The river has its source in Lake Wieprz, in Wieprzów Tarnawacki near Tomaszow Lubelski, and flows into the Vistula near Dęblin. The Wieprz is connected to another river, the Krzna, through the 140-kilometer Wieprz-Krzna Canal, built in 1954-1961. Because the Wieprz with its wide valley has not been regulated, its nature is very diverse. The meandering river with its oxbow lakes is inhabited by numerous birds, European otters and Eurasian beavers.

During the Polish-Soviet War, units of the Polish 4th Army concentrated along the Wieprz, getting ready for the Battle of Warsaw. In September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of Tomaszow Lubelski took place by the Wieprz.

<text>The Pilica is a river in central Poland, and the longest left tributary of the Vistula river, with a length of 333 kilometres (8th longest). All 9,258 km2 of its basin area is in Poland.

It flows through the Polish Jura, after which it enters Central Polish Plains. Pilica flows into the Vistula near the village of Ostrowek, in a geographical region of Central Vistula Valley. In 1974, a dam was built near Sulejow, resulting in the creation of man-made reservoir Sulejow Lake, which has the area of 2,700 hectares. The region in the basin of the Pilica is sometimes called Nadpilicze, and the river itself marks boundary between Lesser Poland, and two other historical provinces of the country, Greater Poland and Mazovia.

The first &quot;open-air river museum&quot; in Poland, the Open-air museum of Pilica river, is located on the waterway and the Blue Springs nature reserve lies next to the river.

<text>The Noteć (; , ) is a river in central Poland with a length of (7th longest) and a basin area of . It is the largest tributary of the Warta river and lies completely within Poland.

==Course==

It rises in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship and flows through Lake Gopło and the town of Inowrocław. It reaches the voivodeship of Greater Poland in the historic Pałuki region south of Piła. Further down in Lubusz Voivodeship, it empties into the Warta at Santok near Gorzów Wielkopolski. The river is usually subdivided into an upper part (Noteć Górna), running from its source to Nakło, and a lower part (Noteć Dolna) from Nakło to its mouth into the Warta River. At Nakło, the Bydgoszcz Canal, built in 1773/74, connects the Noteć River with the Brda river, a tributary of the Vistula, at Bydgoszcz.

The lower sections down from the mouth of the Drawa (near Krzyż Wielkopolski) are located within the broad Toruń-Eberswalde &quot;Urstromtal&quot;. These large wetlands, with only two historic river crossings at Santok and Drezdenko, are sparsely populated.

Most portions of the Noteć are navigable. Several locks and dams connect the Vistula and the Warta/Oder waterways.

==History==
In medieval times, the impenetrable marshes of the lower Noteć River formed the border between the Kingdom of Poland and the lands of the Pomeranian tribes on the Baltic coast. Disputed for centuries, the fortresses of Santok and Drezdenko finally were acquired by Margrave Conrad of Brandenburg on the occasion of his wedding with Constance of Poznań, daughter of the Piast duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland, in 1260. 

After several unsuccessful attempts by the Polish Piasts to regain control, the area along the lower Noteć was finally incorporated into the Brandeburg &quot;Neumark&quot; region. For centuries, the border with the Greater Polish Poznań Voivodeship ran between Drezdenko (&quot;Driesen&quot;) and Krzyż upstream in the east. Under the rule of Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg from about 1603, the fortress was rebuilt and further settlements were erected within the wetlands. First plans for a large-scale drainage and land amelioration were developed under King Frederick William I of Prussia in 1738/39, though not carried out until after the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1763.

After the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the adjacent Greater Polish lands up the river were annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia as the Netze District. The territory, created by the Prussian administration, was again ceded to newly established Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, but fell back to Prussia by resolution of the Vienna Congress in 1815.

<text>The San (; &quot;Sian&quot;; ) is a river in southeastern Poland and western Ukraine. It is a tributary of the river Vistula. With a length of , the San is the 6th-longest Polish river. It has a basin area of 16,877 km2, of which 14,426 km2 is in Poland.

==Etymology==
 in proto-Indo-European languages means &#x27;speed&#x27; or &#x27;rapid stream&#x27;. In Celtic languages, means &#x27;river&#x27;.

==Course==
The San arises in the Carpathian Mountains near the village of Sianky, at an elevation of , exactly on the Polish-Ukrainian border () and on the continental watershed, and forms the border between Poland and Ukraine for approximately its first . Poland&#x27;s largest artificial lake, Lake Solina, was created by a dam on the San River near Lesko.

The San flows into the Vistula near Sandomierz.

== History of the region ==
Historical records first mention the river in 1097 as &quot;Sanъ&quot;, &quot;reku Sanъ&quot;, &quot;k Sanovi&quot;; then as &quot;nad Sanomъ&quot; (1152) and &quot;Sanu&quot; (1287). On the old maps of the Ruthenian Voivodeship, Poland 1339–1772 it was referred to as &quot;San&quot; (1339), San (1372), &quot;Szan&quot; (1406), &quot;Sanok&quot; (1438), &quot;Saan&quot; (1439), &quot;Sayn&quot; (1445), &quot;San&quot; (1467), &quot;Szan&quot; (1517), and &quot;Schan&quot; (1526).

Humans had first settled the southeastern region of present-day Poland (the Subcarpathian Voivodeship or &quot;Podkarpacie&quot;) in prehistoric times. In the pre-Roman era various tribes, including the Celts, Goths and Vandals (Przeworsk culture and Puchov culture)
overran the area. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Hungarians and Slavs invaded the area.

The San valley must have become an important trade-route and axis of human settlement as early as the 9th or 10th century. The region subsequently became part of the Great Moravian state. Upon the invasion of the Hungarian tribes into the heart of the Great Moravian Empire around 899, the Lendians of the area declared their allegiance to the Hungarian Empire. The region then became a site of contention between Poland, Kievan Rus and Hungary starting in around the 9th century. This area was mentioned for the first time in 981 (by Nestor), when Volodymyr the Great of Kievan Rus took the area over on his way into Poland. In 1018 it returned to Poland, in 1031 reverted to Rus, and in 1340 was recovered by Casimir III of Poland.

During the years 966–1018, 1340–1772 (the Ruthenian Voivodeship) and 1918–1939, the region was part of Poland. Between 1772 and 1918 it belonged to the Austrian empire, which became the Austro-Hungarian empire when the double monarchy was introduced. This region, including the area west and east of the Subcarpathian Voivodship, was controlled by Austria for almost 120 years. During that time it was known as Galicia.

Ukrainians traditionally associated the San with their ethnographic western frontier: this is reflected in the State Anthem of Ukraine (which describes Ukraine as extending from the San to the Don) and the March of Ukrainian Nationalists (which calls for a Ukraine from the San to the Caucasus). The Poland–Ukraine border today follows the San for approximately the first 50 km of its course.

The San River, which has seen many battles in its history, was a battle site at the beginning of World War II in 1939. At the outset of the German invasion of Poland, Polish forces attempted to defend a line along the San from September 6, until German forces broke out of their bridgeheads on September 12.

<text>A dry lake bed, also known as a playa (), is a basin or depression that formerly contained a standing surface water body, which disappears when evaporation processes exceed recharge. If the floor of a dry lake is covered by deposits of alkaline compounds, it is known as an alkali flat. If covered with salt, it is known as a &quot;salt flat.&quot;

==Terminology==
If its basin is primarily salt, then a dry lake bed is called a &quot;salt pan&quot;, &quot;pan&quot;, or &quot;salt flat&quot; (the latter being a remnant of a salt lake). &quot;Hardpan&quot; is the dry terminus of an internally drained basin in a dry climate, a designation typically used in the Great Basin of the western United States.

Another term for dry lake bed is &quot;playa&quot;. The Spanish word &quot;playa&quot; () literally means &quot;beach&quot;. Dry lakes are known by this name in some parts of Mexico and the western United States. This term is used e.g. on the Llano Estacado and other parts of the Southern High Plains and is commonly used to address paleolake sediments in the Sahara like Lake Ptolemy.

In South America, the usual term for a dry lake bed is &quot;salar&quot; or &quot;salina&quot;, Spanish for &quot;salt pan&quot;.

&quot;Pan&quot; is the term used in most of South Africa. These may include the small round highveld pans, typical of the Chrissiesmeer area, to the extensive pans of the Northern Cape province.

Terms used in Australia include &quot;salt pans&quot; (where evaporite minerals are present) and &quot;clay pans&quot;.

In Arabic, a salt flat is called a &quot;sabkha&quot; (also spelled &quot;sabkhah&quot;, &quot;subkha&quot; or &quot;sebkha&quot;) or &quot;shott&quot; (&quot;chott&quot;). In Central Asia, a similar &quot;cracked mud&quot; salt flat is known as a takyr. In Iran salt flats are called &quot;kavir&quot;.

==Formation==

A dry lake is formed when water from rain or other sources, like intersection with a water table, flows into a dry depression in the landscape, creating a pond or lake. If the total annual evaporation rate exceeds the total annual inflow, the depression will eventually become dry again, forming a dry lake. Salts originally dissolved in the water precipitate out and are left behind, gradually building up over time. A dry lake appears as a flat bed of clay, generally encrusted with precipitated salts. These evaporite minerals are a concentration of weathering products such as sodium carbonate, borax, and other salts. In deserts, a dry lake may be found in an area ringed by bajadas.

Dry lakes are typically formed in semi-arid to arid regions of the world. The largest concentration of dry lakes (nearly 22,000) is in the southern High Plains of Texas and eastern New Mexico. Most dry lakes are small. However, Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia, near Potosí, the largest salt flat in the world, comprises 4,085 square miles (10,582 square km).

Many dry lakes contain shallow water during the rainy season, especially during wet years. If the layer of water is thin and is moved around the dry lake bed by wind, an exceedingly hard and smooth surface may develop. Thicker layers of water may result in a &quot;cracked-mud&quot; surface and teepee structure desiccation features. If there is very little water, dunes can form.

The Racetrack Playa, located in Death Valley, California, features a geological phenomenon known as &quot;sailing stones&quot; that leave &quot;racetrack&quot; imprints as they slowly move across the surface without human or animal intervention. These rocks have been recently filmed in motion by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego and are due to a perfect coincidence of events. First, the playa has to fill with water, which must be deep enough to form floating ice during winter, but still shallow enough that the rocks are exposed. When the temperature drops at night, this pond freezes into thin sheets of &quot;windowpane&quot; ice, which then must be thick enough to maintain strength, but thin enough to move freely. Finally, when the sun comes out, the ice melts and cracks into floating panels; these are blown across the playa by light winds, propelling the rocks in front of them. The stones only move once every two or three years and most tracks last for three or four years.

==Ecology==
While a dry lake bed is itself typically devoid of vegetation, they are commonly ringed by shadscale, saltbrush and other salt-tolerant plants that provide critical winter fodder for livestock and other herbivores.
In southwest Idaho and parts of Nevada and Utah there are a number of rare species that occur nowhere else but in the inhospitable environment of seasonally flooded playas. A new species of giant fairy shrimp was found in 2006. Although a large predatory species, it evaded detection because of the murkiness of the playa&#x27;s water caused by winds and a fine clay load. This shrimp species is able to regenerate using tiny undetectable cysts that can remain in a dry lake bed for years until conditions are optimum for hatching.

&quot;Lepidium davisii&quot; is another rare species, a perennial plant whose habitat is restricted to playas in southern Idaho and northern Nevada.

Far from major rivers or lakes, playas are often the only water available to wildlife in the desert. Antelope and other wildlife gather there after rainstorms to drink.

Threats to dry lakes include pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations such as cattle feedlots and dairies. Results are erosion; fertilizer, pesticide and sediment runoff from farms; and overgrazing. A non-native shrub that has been used for rangeland restoration in the west, &quot;Kochia prostrata&quot;, also poses a significant threat to playas and their associated rare species, as it capable of crowding out native vegetation and draining a playa&#x27;s standing water because of its root growth.

==Human use==

The extremely flat, smooth, and hard surfaces of dry lake beds make them ideal for fast motor vehicles and motorcycles. Large-sized dry lakes are excellent spots for pursuing land speed records, as the smoothness of the surface allows low-clearance vehicles to travel very fast without any risk of disruption by surface irregularities, and the path traveled has no obstacles to avoid. The dry lake beds at Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and Black Rock Desert in Nevada have both been used for setting land speed records. Lake Eyre and Lake Gairdner in South Australia have also been used for various land speed record attempts. Dry lake beds that rarely fill with water are sometimes used as locations for air bases for similar reasons. Examples include Groom Lake at Area 51 in Nevada and Edwards Air Force Base (known initially as Muroc Dry Lake) in California.

Brines from the subsurface of dry lakes are often exploited for valuable minerals in solution. See, for example, Searles Dry Lake and Lithium resources.

Under United States law, a &quot;playa lake&quot; may be considered isolated wetlands and may be eligible to enroll in the new wetlands component of the Conservation Reserve Program, enacted in the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107–171, Sec. 2101).

The Burning Man yearly event takes place in a playa in the Black Rock Desert in western Nevada every year.

Fangfang Yao et al (2023), at the University of Virginia reported that more than half of the world&#x27;s large lakes are drying up. They assessed almost 2,000 large lakes using satellite measurements combined with climate and hydrological models. They found that unsustainable human use, changes in rainfall and run-off, sedimentation, and rising temperatures have driven lake levels down globally, with 53% of lakes showing a decline from 1992 to 2020.

<text>The Narew (; ; or ) is a 499-kilometre (310 mi) river primarily in north-eastern Poland. It is a tributary of the river Vistula. The Narew is one of Europe&#x27;s few braided rivers, the term relating to the twisted channels resembling braided hair. Around 57 kilometres (35 mi) of the river flows through western Belarus.

==Etymology==
The name of the river is from a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*nr&quot; primarily associated with &quot;water&quot; (compare Neretva, Neris, Ner and Nur) or from a Lithuanian language verb &quot;nerti&quot; associated primarily with &quot;diving&quot; and &quot;flood&quot;.

==Name of the lower portion==
The portion of the river between the junctions with the Western Bug and the Vistula is also known as the Bugonarew, Narwio-Bug, Narwo-Bug, Bugo-Narew, Narwiobug or Narwobug. At the confluence near Zegrze the Bug is 1.6x longer, drains a 1.4x larger basin, and has a slightly greater average discharge (158 m³/s at Wyszków vs 146 m³/s at Pułtusk for the Narew, both ~25 km above the junction). Thus the Bugonarew was often considered part of the Bug river and the Narew a right tributary of the Bug.

On December 27, 1962, Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz abolished the name &quot;Bugonarew&quot; soon after the Zegrze Reservoir had been constructed. Since then the river Bug has officially been considered part of the river Narew&#x27;s system, with the Bug being a left tributary of the Narew (by this classification, the River Narew is a right tributary of the River Vistula). The name Bugonarew however is still used, especially by the inhabitants of local towns, such as Pułtusk.

==Geography==
The Narew flows through the geographical region of Europe known as the &quot;Wysoczyzny Podlasko – Bialoruskie&quot; (English: Plateau of Podlasie and Belarus) located within the Podlaskie Voivodeship and Masovian Voivodeship of Poland and the Hrodna Voblast of Belarus.

The Narew is the fifth longest Polish river.

== History ==
On August 23, 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, agreeing to divide Poland along the Narew, Vistula (Wisła), and San rivers.

On September 6, 1939, Polish military forces attempted to use the Narew as a defense line against German attack during the German invasion of Poland. This was abandoned the next day in favor of the Bug as German forces had already penetrated the defenses.

The Battle of Wizna was fought along the banks of the river between September 7 and September 10, 1939, between the forces of Poland and Germany during the initial stages of Invasion of Poland. Because it consisted of a small force holding a piece of fortified territory against a vastly larger invasion for three days at great cost before being annihilated with no known survivors, Wizna is sometimes referred to as a Polish Thermopylae in Polish culture.

On September 17, 1939, the USSR invaded Poland. By 28 September, the Soviet Army had reached the line of the rivers Narew, Bug River, Vistula and San – completing the division of Poland as negotiated in advance.

<text>Science fiction conventions are gatherings of fans of the speculative fiction subgenre, science fiction. Historically, science fiction conventions had focused primarily on literature, but the purview of many extends to such other avenues of expression as films, television, comics, animation, and games. The format can vary but will tend to have a few similar features such as a guest of honour, discussion panels, readings and large special events such as opening/closing ceremonies and some form of party or entertainment. Science fiction conventions started off primarily in the United Kingdom and the United States but have now spread further. Several countries have their own individual conventions, as well as playing host to rotating international conventions.

== History ==

The Royal Albert Hall has asserted that the Vril-Ya Bazaar and Fete, a charitable event held at the Hall in 1891, was the world&#x27;s first science fiction convention. The event was a multi-day fundraising bazaar themed around the popular 1871 science fiction novel &quot;The Coming Race&quot; by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, which involves the Vril-Ya, a subterranean race of winged superhuman beings. The event at the Royal Albert Hall featured elements similar to those of later science fiction conventions (in particular modern commercial events), such as special guests (although apparently none directly related to the novel or science fiction generally), special events and other performances, set pieces and special effects (such as flying &quot;Vril-Ya&quot; mannequins), costumes (essentially what later came to be called &quot;cosplay&quot;), and stalls selling merchandise related to the event&#x27;s theme and named using the Vril-Ya language as presented in the novel. However, the event was not contemporaneously referred to as a science fiction convention and was primarily a fundraiser for the London Massage and Galvanic Hospital, one of a number of such events held with other, non-science fictional, themes put on by the hospital&#x27;s founder Dr. Herbert Tibbits. (The event not only failed as a fundraiser, but led to Tibbits&#x27; personal bankruptcy.)

The precise time and place of the first science fiction convention is a matter of some dispute. The idea and form was clearly anticipated in Robert Bloch&#x27;s short story about a large convention of writers, &quot;The Ultimate Ultimatum&quot; (&quot;Fantasy Magazine&quot;, August 1935), &quot;It was a big convention. Lovecraft was there.&quot; Sometime in 1936, a group of British fans made plans to have an organized gathering, with a planned program of events in a public venue in early 1937. However, on October 22, 1936, a group of six or seven fans from New York City, including David Kyle and Frederik Pohl, traveled by train to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where for several hours they visited a similar number of local fans at the house of Milton A. Rothman. They subsequently declared that event to be the first &quot;science fiction convention.&quot; This small get-together set the stage for a follow-up event held in New York, in February 1937, where &quot;30 or 40&quot; fans gathered at Bohemian Hall in Astoria, Queens. Attendees at this event included James Blish, Charles D. Hornig, Julius Schwartz, and Willis Conover. This event came to be known as the &quot;Second Eastern&quot; and set the stage for the successful Third Eastern held in Philadelphia on October 30, 1937, and the subsequent Fourth Eastern held on May 29, 1938, which attracted over 100 attendees to a meeting hall in Newark, NJ and designated itself as &quot;The First National Science Fiction Convention.&quot; It was at this event that a committee was named to arrange the first World Science Fiction Convention in New York in 1939; formalizing planning that had begun at the Third Eastern. The &quot;First National&quot;, which included the participation of a number of well-known New York editors and professionals from outside fan circles, was a milestone in the evolution of science-fiction conventions as a place for science-fiction (SF) professionals, as well as fans, to meet their colleagues in person.

On January 3, 1937, the British fans held their long-planned event at the Theosophical Hall in Leeds. Around twenty fans, including Eric Frank Russell and Arthur C. Clarke, attended. To this day, many fan historians, especially those in the United Kingdom, contend that the Philadelphia meeting was a convention in name only, whereas other fan historians point out that many similar gatherings since then have been called &quot;conventions&quot; without eliciting any disagreement.

Regardless of what gathering is held to have been the first science fiction convention, American fans had organized sufficiently by 1939 to hold, in conjunction with the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, the first &quot;World Science Fiction Convention,&quot; in New York City. Subsequent conventions were held in Chicago in 1940 and Denver in 1941. Like many cultural events, it was suspended during World War II. Conventions resumed in 1946 with the hosting of the World Science Fiction Convention in Los Angeles, California. The first Worldcon held outside the United States was Torcon I in Toronto in 1948; since then, Worldcons have been held in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Japan, Finland, and Ireland although the majority of Worldcons are still held in the United States.

==Types==
Since the first conventions in the late 1930s, such as the first Worldcon, hundreds of local and regional science fiction conventions have sprung up around the world either as one-time or annual events. At these conventions, fans of science fiction come together with the professional writers, artists, and filmmakers in the genre to discuss its many aspects. Some cities have a number of science-fiction conventions, as well as a number of special interest conventions for anime, media, or other related groups. Some conventions move from city to city, serving a particular country, region, or special interest. Nearly every weekend of the year now has at least one convention somewhere and some conventions are held on holiday weekends where four or more days can be devoted to events.

===International conventions===

====World Science Fiction Convention====
Worldcon, or more formally The World Science Fiction Convention, is a science fiction convention that has been held each year since 1939 (except for the years 1942 through 1945, during World War II). It is the annual convention of the World Science Fiction Society (or WSFS), an unincorporated body whose members are defined as &quot;all people who have paid membership dues to the Committee of the current Worldcon&quot; (i.e., that are either upcoming or currently under way). These members of WSFS vote both to select the site of the Worldcon two years in advance and to select the winners of the Hugo Awards, which are presented at the convention. The rules for venue selection are deliberately drafted to ensure the convention occurs in a different city each year.

====World Fantasy Convention====
Fantasy is usually considered alongside science fiction at conventions (the terms were used interchangeably for most of the period from 1926–1966). Conventions that are nominally science-fiction conventions, such as Worldcon, are also fantasy conventions in all but name. World Fantasy Convention was begun in 1975, and has since been held on an annual basis. The World Fantasy Convention, however, is less oriented toward the fan community, and is primarily a professional gathering (for writers, editors, publishers, etc.). Many of those who attend &quot;World Fantasy&quot; also attend Worldcon. However, this convention is more focused on authors and publishing, with a much higher proportion of authors in attendance; as such it does not usually include the broad range of events (masquerade, dances, video room, etc.) that one would normally find at a general-interest convention.

====World Horror Convention====

The World Horror Convention is an annual gathering of professionals of the World Horror Society and other interested parties. Up till 2009, all World Horror Conventions had been held in the United States or Canada, usually alternating between the east and west sides of the country. The 2010 convention was held in Brighton in the UK, the first time it took place outside North America. The Horror Writers Association&#x27;s Bram Stoker Award ceremony has been held in conjunction with the convention for the last few years.

===National conventions===
A National Convention is usually held annually in a number of countries. The British Eastercon is the oldest of these. National conventions are often run by, or in association with, a national Science-fiction organization or club.

===Regional conventions===
Before the age of inexpensive travel, regional conventions arose to attract fans from broad geographical areas. The oldest of these is Westercon, whose meetings are held on a rotational basis among regions in the western United States and Canada. Eurocon is held each year somewhere in Europe, often in eastern European countries where fandom is a new phenomenon. A North American Science Fiction Convention (NASFiC) is held in North America in any year when the Worldcon is outside of North America. DeepSouthCon is held in the Southern United States, with a focus on Southern culture in science fiction.

===Local conventions===
Local conventions, which are offshoots of the main regional conventions, draw fans from the immediate area in which the convention is being held, though these have very few attendees who have traveled from afar to attend the main convention. Some local conventions, including events run by student groups from high schools or colleges, draw their attendance solely from the student body and campus neighborhood. Others, such as those run by UK universities, may draw from a wider audience than just the university itself. 

===Media conventions===
Some conventions are focused on (audio-visual) &quot;media&quot;, that is, science fiction on film and television. There are general media conventions covering a broad range of science fiction in media, such as Toronto Trek, and then there are conventions focused on a single body of work, such as &quot;Celebration,&quot; the official &quot;Star Wars&quot; convention; &quot;Galaxyfest,&quot; the yearly event in Vulcan, Alberta dedicated to &quot;Star Trek&quot;; and BotCon, the official Transformers convention. Most media conventions are commercial shows run for profit, though some are organized by non-profit fan groups similar to general science-fiction conventions.

===Comic and &quot;popular culture&quot; conventions===
From comics and media fandom, a category of &quot;popular culture&quot; conventions has emerged, such as Comic-Con International and Dragon*Con, featuring a wide range of &quot;pop culture&quot; events ranging from animation, drive-in movie theaters, old-time radio, horror movies, and cowboy celebrities. These events have become much larger than traditional SF conventions; nearly a hundred thousand people attend Comic-Con in San Diego each year. Although not all of them are commercial ventures, they tend to suffer the same drawbacks as commercial shows (long lines, overcrowding, etc.) due to the sheer size of the events.

===Special interest conventions===
There are many conventions focused on particular special interests within science fiction. For example, Wiscon, in addition to being the Wisconsin Science Fiction Convention, is focused on feminist SF/fantasy and gender, race, and class issues/studies. 
Diversicon concentrates on the vastness of human diversity. 
Filking conventions such as Ohio Valley Filk Fest, FilkOntario, and GaFilk gather those interested in science fiction-related music. 
Costume-Con gathers people from around the world who are mainly interested in science fiction, fantasy, and historical costuming. 
Penguicon combines science fiction with technology, particularly Linux and open source software. 
The term &quot;relaxacon&quot; is used for conventions which tend to be less about programming, and more about socializing within the fan community; this is quite different from &quot;sercon&quot; (SERious CONstructive discussion of science-fiction topics) conventions.

===Commercial shows vs. volunteer conventions ===

An important distinction can be made between commercial events (often called &quot;shows&quot;) – those run by dedicated companies who specialize in con organization, or by local for-profit firms – and volunteer-run cons.

Usually run for profit, commercial events tend to charge for &quot;tickets&quot; or &quot;admission&quot; rather than having &quot;memberships&quot;. A primary focus of commercial events is meeting celebrities, such as stars of science fiction TV show and movies, anime voice actors, etc. There are frequently very long lines of people waiting for autographs at commercial events; while famous actors like William Shatner of &quot;Star Trek&quot; are paid tens of thousands of dollars per convention, minor and obscure bit players pay to set up booths to sell autographs and memorabilia. Commercial events also tend to have less small-scale programming; panels will more often be composed of famous actors, directors, etc. on press junkets, where the panels are held in very large rooms with very high attendance. The largest cons (in terms of attendance) tend to be commercial ones. Commercial events tend to be more likely to be about comics, manga, anime, and popular visual media than volunteer cons, and they also tend to attract the younger generation, but this is not absolute by any means. Some commercial conventions have official licences from the company which produces a particular movie or TV show to run a convention about a particular movie or show. They have been known to aggressively go after fan-run conventions via their legal teams.

Volunteer cons, on the other hand, tend to be smaller in scope and more intimate in character. Panels may be more lightly attended; however, it is the fans themselves who mostly take part in the panels. Although there are frequent autograph sessions, they tend to be less of an attraction for volunteer cons. Admission to volunteer cons is usually called &quot;membership&quot;, thus emphasizing that the fans themselves are the ones who make up the con, rather than the staff who run commercial cons. A community of fans who run such conventions has developed, and many of them share their best practices and keep convention-running traditions alive, including at specialist con-running conventions such as SMOFcon.

==Anatomy of a typical convention==
Although wide variations exist between different conventions, there is a general pattern to which most adhere.

===Guests of Honor===


Most conventions have &quot;Guest(s) of Honor (GoH)&quot;. These guests are to some extent the headliners of the convention. A convention may have as many Guests of Honor as the convention committee wishes. Along with Author and perhaps Fan Guests of Honor (fans who are not necessarily celebrities but have made a significant contribution to the fan community), a convention may have an Artist GoH, Editor GoH, Filk or Music GoH, a Toastmaster, and Special Guests. A Memorial Guest of Honor (as at Readercon) or Ghost of Honor (as at Worldcon 2008/Denvention 3) is a deceased individual who is selected as a focal point of the festivities. Potlatch, however, has an annual &quot;Book of Honor&quot; instead.

===Professionals at conventions===
Conventions provide a forum for fans to see first-hand and meet their favorite authors and artists. They also serve the interests of authors, editors, and other publishing professionals, providing opportunities for networking, promotion, and a convenient location for contract negotiations and other business meetings. At traditional science-fiction conventions, there is little or no distinction made between the &quot;pros&quot; and the &quot;fans&quot;. Many professionals in the field began as fans, and may still consider themselves fans; and more than a few fans have also worked professionally or semi-professionally in the field. At a small number of cons, there is a category for &quot;Attending Professionals&quot;, professionals who are paying full con price to enter but also get a special name badge that proclaims them to be professionals in whatever field they are involved in.

===Program===
Panel-led discussions, or &quot;Panels&quot;, usually fill up the daytime hours of most conventions with typically one-hour discussions of topics related to science fiction, fantasy, and fandom in general. Some conventions have well-attended, scheduled panels starting as late as midnight. Panel members (even professionals) are not customarily paid for their appearance, although many North-American conventions waive membership fees for program participants or rebate them after the convention.

Some program items are set presentations by experts. Science speakers are among the most popular program items at many conventions. Slides (either photographic or computer), video clips, or handouts might be used for such presentations.

Readings and &quot;kaffeeklatsches&quot; are program items where a single author either reads from their work or has an informal discussion with fans.

===Special events===

The first night of the convention &quot;Opening Ceremonies&quot; are often held, where organizers and marquee guests are introduced and speeches might be made. Sometimes, conventions will have a skits, musical performances, video clips, or other samples of the convention as part of the Opening Ceremonies.

A costume contest called a masquerade is often held where persons go on stage and compete for nominal prizes based on their skill in assembling and presenting genre-inspired outfits. This, however, would be more accurately labelled a &quot;talent show&quot; rather than the &quot;fancy dress ball&quot; that the term suggests (although British fandom sometimes uses the term &quot;fancy dress&quot;). Anime fans might refer to the masquerade as cosplay, but there are notable and subtle distinctions between the terms.

Some conventions feature award ceremonies, in which the best works and most notable individuals are recognized for their contributions to the field. Worldcon has several award ceremonies, most notably the Hugo Awards, but also the Sidewise Award for Alternate History and other awards. VCON in Vancouver, BC features the Elron Awards for dubious distinctions in science fiction, including an annual award for John Norman author of the Gor series.

Just as art shows display the visual aspect of science fiction, many conventions include concerts or other music-oriented events as part of the convention. Often these are performances by filkers, though other musicians may also appear at a con.

A convention may have one or more auctions. The &quot;Art Auction&quot; is an event where the most popular items from the art show are sold to the most interested buyers at the convention. Many conventions also have auctions for charities, either formal or fannish; the latter would include auctions on behalf of TAFF (the Trans-Atlantic Fan Fund) or DUFF (the Down Under Fan Fund).

Evening entertainment often includes a combination of official and unofficial events, including concerts, dances, formal invitational dinners, and fandom-themed room parties. Additionally, other convention committees hold room parties in order to promote their own convention and to increase their membership. A &quot;bid party&quot; is a room party held to influence the choice of the location of a future convention (such as Worldcon) by advertising its advantages.

Some conventions have a &quot;Closing Ceremony&quot; to formally mark the end of the convention. Depending on the convention, this can be a major gathering of most of the membership, or it may be lightly attended or dispensed with entirely as members are occupied with packing up and checking out of the hotel.

===Exhibits and fixed functions===
A &quot;Dealers&quot;&#x27; or &quot;Hucksters&#x27; Room&quot; is available, where merchants sell wares which may be of interest to fans. These include books, action figures, prop replicas and t-shirts. Similarly, there is often an &quot;Art Show&quot; where genre-inspired art is displayed and usually made available for auction or purchase. Smaller conventions may simply have an informal &quot;Dealers&#x27; Row&quot;, a section of hotel rooms from which dealers sell goods, while larger conventions may have both an official dealers&#x27; room and an unofficial dealers&#x27; row.

The &quot;Art Show&quot; is generally an open art exhibition; that is, it is open to all comers and all art submitted is exhibited for sale. This naturally leads to a wide variety of types of artwork, from professional illustrations to outsider art, with many amateur works. The subject matter is tailored to the interests of fandom, i. e. many spaceships, dragons, unicorns, vampires, cat girls etc. Art shows often permit sales by artists, these sales constituting a significant source of income for some artists.

Traditionally, many conventions have had &quot;video rooms&quot; in which genre-related audiovisual presentations take place, typically commercial Hollywood movies, genre television show episodes, and anime. If there are multiple media rooms, each one may have themed content. Larger conventions may also have a genuine &quot;Film Room,&quot; for presentation of actual movies on film instead of video.

&quot;Game Rooms&quot; are also available at some conventions for attendees to play a variety of genre games, including collectible card games like &quot;&quot;, role-playing games like &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;, miniatures games like &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, and board games like &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot;. Easy, fast-playing card games, e.g. &quot;Apples to Apples&quot;, are popular as they don&#x27;t require a large time commitment or deep knowledge of rules, thus allowing casual gamers to join in.
===Con suite===
At North American conventions, a convention hospitality suite or &quot;consuite&quot; is often provided as a room reserved for light refreshments, a quiet conversation, and a place to briefly rest. The refreshments typically include coffee, tea, juice or soda, and light meals appropriate for the time of day. Depending on local liquor distribution and liability laws, the suite may serve alcohol. At conventions in the rest of the world, the hotel or convention centre bar typically offers the same social function. At conventions in the United Kingdom, the provision of cask ale is usual.

=== Dead dog party ===

Many conventions have a &quot;dead dog party&quot; in the evening of the last day of the convention, after closing ceremonies. This is the traditional winding-down party where the remaining attendees are unlikely to have huge amounts of energy. This party is an attempt to ease people back into the real world outside of the convention and can be an effective method of warding off the depression which is often associated with the end of a major event. A dead dog party can last until the following morning.

===Idiosyncrasy===
Many con-goers take pride in being interesting and unusual, and naturally many cons are highly idiosyncratic. Cons often have activities, running jokes, organizational methods and other features that not only differentiate them from other cons but are often a point of pride. Most cons vary from the above outline in one or more important ways, and many have their own unique cultural characteristics.

For example:
*Capricon in Wheeling, Illinois, always includes an entire track of spoof programming. Originally held in the Phineas Taylor B room, it is now slated for the Lake Wobegon room.
*At an early Minicon, the President of Mnstf (the con&#x27;s sponsoring organization) declared himself to be President for Life. This was resolved by play-assassinating the President. Ever since then, the President has been &quot;assassinated&quot; by various humorous means at Closing Ceremonies.
*Many cons have idiosyncratic names, including puns, in-jokes, or portmanteaus.

Most cons will tend to evolve many of their own idiosyncrasies along these lines. To fans, these are often part of the charm each convention offers.

=== Peace-bonding and weapons policies ===
A peace-bond is a conspicuous lock, tie, or mark which makes or identifies something unusable, such as a weapon, and shows that the owner&#x27;s intentions are purely peaceful.

At some conventions, attendees carry real weapons or costume props that appear to be weapons. To forestall concerns about mis-use of real weapons at such events, the security team &quot;peace-bonds&quot; anything that might look like a weapon.

The event&#x27;s &quot;weapons policy&quot; may offer objective criteria to determine what looks like a weapon. For example, a weapons policy may require a peace-bond for anything that a reasonable person might recognize as a weapon from a short distance in dim light. Real weapons, if allowed, are disabled, secured, and marked. For example, bright orange zip ties may be used to hold a sword in a scabbard or to hold a pistol in a holster. Simulated or costume props may require conspicuous marks, such as bright ribbons or zip ties, to show that security has deemed them safe to be carried. Simulated weapons or props which can be used as a weapon may be disabled or secured in the way as real weapons.

Peace-bonding helps security control the use or abuse of real weapons at a convention or other event: anything that looks like a weapon but which is not peace-bonded is immediately deemed to be suspicious. SF writer C. J. Cherryh writes on her website, &quot;I was a witness of pre-peacebonding times, was narrowly missed, and assure you this is a good idea. Read the convention weapons policy.&quot;

<text>In fluid dynamics, a gravity current or density current is a primarily horizontal flow in a gravitational field that is driven by a density difference in a fluid or fluids and is constrained to flow horizontally by, for instance, a ceiling. Typically, the density difference is small enough for the Boussinesq approximation to be valid. Gravity currents can be thought of as either finite in volume, such as the pyroclastic flow from a volcano eruption, or continuously supplied from a source, such as warm air leaving the open doorway of a house in winter. Other examples include dust storms, turbidity currents, avalanches, discharge from wastewater or industrial processes into rivers, or river discharge into the ocean.

Gravity currents are typically much longer than they are tall. Flows that are primarily vertical are known as plumes. As a result, it can be shown (using dimensional analysis) that vertical velocities are generally much smaller than horizontal velocities in the current; the pressure distribution is thus approximately hydrostatic, apart from near the leading edge. Gravity currents may be simulated by the shallow water equations, with special dispensation for the leading edge which behaves as a discontinuity. When a gravity current propagates along a plane of neutral buoyancy within a stratified ambient fluid, it is known as a gravity current intrusion.

== Structure and propagation ==

Although gravity currents represent the flow of fluid of one density over/under another, discussion is usually focused on the fluid that is propagating. Gravity currents can originate either from finite volume flows or from continuous flows. In the latter case, the fluid in the head is constantly replaced and the gravity current can therefore propagate, in theory, forever. Propagation of a continuous flow can be thought of as the same as that of the tail (or body) of a very long finite volume. Gravity flows are described as consisting of two parts, a head and a tail. The head, which is the leading edge of the gravity current, is a region in which relatively large volumes of ambient fluid are displaced. The tail is the bulk of flow that follows the head. Flow characteristics can be characterized by the Froude and Reynolds numbers, which represent the ratio of flow speed to gravity (buoyancy) and viscosity, respectively.

Propagation of the head usually occurs in three phases. In the first phase, the gravity current propagation is turbulent. The flow displays billowing patterns known as Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, which form in the wake of the head and engulf ambient fluid into the tail: a process referred to as &quot;entrainment&quot;. Direct mixing also occurs at the front of the head through lobes and cleft structures which form on the surface of the head. According to one paradigm, the leading edge of a gravity current &#x27;controls&#x27; the flow behind it: it provides a boundary condition for the flow. In this phase the propagation rate of the current is approximately constant with time. For many flows of interest, the leading edge moves at a Froude number of about 1; estimates of the exact value vary between about 0.7 and 1.4.
As the driving fluid depletes as a result of the current spreading into the environment, the driving head decreases until the flow becomes laminar. In this phase, there is only very little mixing and the billowing structure of the flow disappears. From this phase onward the propagation rate decreases with time and the current gradually slows down. Finally, as the current spreads even further, it becomes so thin that viscous forces between the intruding fluid and the ambient and boundaries govern the flow. In this phase no more mixing occurs and the propagation rate slows down even more.

The spread of a gravity current depends on the boundary conditions, and two cases are usually distinguished depending on whether the initial release is of the same width as the environment or not. In the case where the widths are the same, one obtains what is usually referred to as a &quot;lock-exchange&quot; or a &quot;corridor&quot; flow. This refers to the flow spreading along walls on both sides and effectively keeping a constant width whilst it propagates. In this case the flow is effectively two-dimensional. Experiments on variations of this flow have been made with lock-exchange flows propagating in narrowing/expanding environments. Effectively, a narrowing environment will result in the depth of the head increasing as the current advances and thereby its rate of propagation increasing with time, whilst in an expanding environment the opposite will occur. In the other case, the flow spreads radially from the source forming an &quot;axisymmetric&quot; flow. The angle of spread depends on the release conditions. In the case of a point release, an extremely rare event in nature, the spread is perfectly axisymmetric, in all other cases the current will form a sector.

When a gravity current encounters a solid boundary, it can either overcome the boundary, by flowing around or over it, or be reflected by it. The actual outcome of the collision depends primarily on the height and width of the obstacle. If the obstacle is shallow (part) of the gravity current will overcome the obstacle by flowing over it. Similarly, if the width of the obstacle is small, the gravity current will flow around it, just like a river flows around a boulder. If the obstacle cannot be overcome, provided propagation is in the turbulent phase, the gravity current will first surge vertically up (or down depending on the density contrast) along the obstacle, a process known as &quot;sloshing&quot;. Sloshing induces a lot of mixing between the ambient and the current and this forms an accumulation of lighter fluid against the obstacle. As more and more fluid accumulates against the obstacle, this starts to propagate in the opposite direction to the initial current, effectively resulting in a second gravity current flowing on top of the original gravity current. This reflection process is a common feature of doorway flows (see below), where a gravity current flows into a finite-size space. In this case the flow repeatedly collides with the end walls of the space, causing a series of currents travelling back and forth between opposite walls. This process has been described in detail by Lane-Serff.

== Research ==
The first mathematical study of the propagation of gravity currents can be attributed to T. B. Benjamin. 
Observations of intrusions and collisions between fluids of differing density were made well before T. B. Benjamin&#x27;s study, see for example those by Ellison and Tuner, by M. B. Abbot 
or D. I. H. Barr. 
J. E. Simpson from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of Cambridge University in the UK carried out longstanding research on gravity currents and issued a multitude of papers on the subject. He published an article 
in 1982 for &quot;Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics&quot; which summarizes the state of research in the domain of gravity currents at the time. Simpson also published a more detailed book on the topic.

== In nature and the built environment ==
Gravity currents are capable of transporting material across large horizontal distances. For example, turbidity currents on the seafloor may carry material thousands of kilometers. Gravity currents occur at a variety of scales throughout nature. Examples include avalanches, haboobs, seafloor turbidity currents, lahars, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows. There are also gravity currents with large density variations - the so-called low Mach number compressible flows. An example of such a gravity current is the heavy gas dispersion in the atmosphere with initial ratio of gas density to density of atmosphere between about 1.5 and 5.

Gravity currents are frequently encountered in the built environment in the form of doorway flows. These occur when a door (or window) separates two rooms of different temperature and air exchanges are allowed to occur. This can for example be experienced when sitting in a heated lobby during winter and the entrance door is suddenly opened. In this case the cold air will first be felt by ones feet as a result of the outside air propagating as a gravity current along the floor of the room.
Doorway flows are of interest in the domain of natural ventilation and air conditioning/refrigeration and have been extensively investigated.

==Modelling approaches==
===Box models===
For a finite volume gravity current, perhaps the simplest modelling approach is via a box model where a &quot;box&quot; (rectangle for 2D problems, cylinder for 3D) is used to represent the current. The box does not rotate or shear, but changes in aspect ratio (i.e. stretches out) as the flow progresses. Here, the dynamics of the problem are greatly simplified (i.e. the forces controlling the flow are not direct considered, only their effects) and typically reduce to a condition dictating the motion of the front via a Froude number and an equation stating the global conservation of mass, i.e. for a 2D problem
:formula_1

where is the Froude number, is the speed at the front, is the reduced gravity, is the height of the box, is the length of the box and is the volume per unit width. The model is not a good approximation in the early slumping stage of a gravity current, where along the current is not at all constant, or the final viscous stage of a gravity current, where friction becomes important and changes . The model is a good in the stage between these, where the Froude number at the front is constant and the shape of the current has a nearly constant height.

Additional equations can be specified for processes that would alter the density of the intruding fluid such as through sedimentation. The front condition (Froude number) generally cannot be determined analytically but can instead be found from experiment or observation of natural phenomena. The Froude number is not necessarily a constant, and may depend on the height of the flow in when this is comparable to the depth of overlying fluid.

The solution to this problem is found by noting that and integrating for an initial length, . In the case of a constant volume and Froude number , this leads to

<text>Granville Tailer Woods (April 23, 1856 – January 30, 1910) was an American inventor who held more than 60 patents in the United States. He was the first African American mechanical and electrical engineer after the Civil War. Self-taught, he concentrated most of his work on trains and streetcars. One of his inventions is the Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph, a variation of the induction telegraph that relied on ambient static electricity from existing telegraph lines to send messages between train stations and moving trains.

Granville T. Woods invented and patented Tunnel Construction for the electric railroad system, electrical rollercoasters and multiple newspapers referred to him as the &quot;Black Edison&quot;.

==Early life==
Granville T. Woods was born to Martha J. Brown and Cyrus Woods. He had a brother named Lyates and a sister named Rachel. His mother was part Native American, and his father was African American. Granville attended school in Columbus, Ohio, until age 10 but had to leave due to his family&#x27;s poverty, which meant he needed to work; he served an apprenticeship in a machine shop and learned the trades of machinist and blacksmith. Some sources of his day asserted that he also received two years of college-level training in &quot;electrical and mechanical engineering&quot;, but little is known about where he might have studied.

==Career==
In 1872, Woods obtained a job as a fireman on the Danville and Southern Railroad in Missouri. He eventually became an engineer and in December 1874, moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he worked at a rolling mill, the Springfield Iron Works. He studied mechanical and electrical engineering in college from 1876 to 1878.

In 1878, he took a job aboard the steamer &quot;Ironsides&quot; and became chief engineer within two years. When he returned to Ohio, he became an engineer with the Dayton and Southwestern Railroad in southwestern Ohio. He moved to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1880, and established his business as an electrical engineer and an inventor. After receiving the multiplex telegraph patent, he reorganized his Cincinnati company as the Woods Electric Co. 

In 1892, he moved his research operations to New York City, where he was joined by his brother, Lyates Woods, who also had several inventions.

== Inventions ==
Over the course of his lifetime, Granville Woods obtained more than 50 patents for inventions including an automatic brake and an egg incubator and for improvements to other technologies such as the safety circuit, telegraph, telephone, and phonograph.

In 1884, Woods received his first patent, for a steam boiler furnace, and in 1885, Woods patented an apparatus that was a combination of a telephone and a telegraph. The device, which he called &quot;telegraphony&quot;, would allow a telegraph station to send voice and telegraph messages through Morse code over a single wire. He sold the rights to this device to the American Bell Telephone Company. In 1887, he patented the Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph, which allowed communications between train stations from moving trains by creating a magnetic field around a coiled wire under the train. Woods caught smallpox prior to patenting the technology, and Lucius Phelps patented it in 1884. In 1887, Woods used notes, sketches, and a working model of the invention to secure the patent. The invention was so successful that Woods began the Woods Electric Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to market and sell his patents. However, the company quickly became devoted to invention creation until it was dissolved in 1893. Thomas Edison later filed a claim to the ownership of this patent, stating that he had first created a similar telegraph and that he was entitled to the patent for the device, and Woods often had difficulties in enjoying his success as other inventors made claims to his devices. Woods was twice successful in defending himself, proving that there were no other devices upon which he could have depended or relied upon to make his device. After Thomas Edison&#x27;s second defeat, he decided to offer Granville Woods a position with the Edison Company, but Woods declined.

In 1888, Woods manufactured a system of overhead electric conducting lines for railroads modeled after the system pioneered by Charles van Depoele, a famed inventor who had by then installed his electric railway system in thirteen United States cities.

Following the Great Blizzard of 1888, New York City Mayor Hugh J. Grant declared that all wires, many of which powered the above-ground rail system, had to be removed and buried, emphasizing the need for an underground system. Woods&#x27;s patent built upon previous third rail systems, improving the safety by using wire brushes to make connections with metallic terminal heads without exposing wires by installing electrical contactor rails. Once the train car had passed over, the wires were no longer live, reducing the risk of injury. It was successfully tested in February 1892 in Coney Island on the Figure Eight Roller Coaster. It is often stated that Woods invented underground third rail systems - this is false, as many other inventors were active in the field at the time and Woods ultimately only made small contributions.
Later that year, he was arrested and charged with libel after taking out an advertisement in a trade magazine warning against patronizing the American Engineering Company of New York City. The company had provided funds for Woods to market the invention, but a crucial component of the invention was missing from the deal, which the manager of the company, James S. Zerbe, later stole. A jury acquitted Woods, but Zerbe had already patented the design, which was valued at $1 million, in Europe. Woods patented the invention in 1893, and in 1901, he sold it to General Electric.
In 1896, Woods created a system for controlling electrical lights in theaters, known as the &quot;safety dimmer&quot;, which was economical, safe, and efficient, saving 40% of electricity use.

Woods is also sometimes credited with the invention of the air brake for trains in 1904; however, George Westinghouse patented the air brake almost 40 years prior, making Woods&#x27;s contribution an improvement to the invention.

== Personal life ==
Although the newspapers of his day generally referred to him as a bachelor, Woods was married to Ada Woods, who was granted a divorce from him in 1891 due to adultery.

In 1902, the &quot;Kansas City American Citizen&quot; described Woods as an articulate, well-spoken man who was meticulous in his style of clothing and preferred to dress in black. At times, he would refer to himself as an immigrant from Australia, in the belief that he would be given more respect if people thought he was from a foreign country, as opposed to African American. In his day, Black newspapers frequently expressed their pride in his achievements, saying he was &quot;the greatest of Negro inventors&quot;, and referring to him as &quot;professor&quot; despite his lack of formal college education.

== Death and legacy ==

Woods died of a cerebral hemorrhage at Harlem Hospital in New York City on January 30, 1910, having sold a number of his devices to such companies as Westinghouse, General Electric, and American Engineering. Woods was interred at St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery in Elmhurst, Queens in an unmarked grave. Historian M.A. Harris helped raise funds, persuading several of the corporations that used Woods&#x27;s inventions to donate money in order to purchase a headstone, which was erected at Woods&#x27;s gravesite in 1975.

Baltimore City Community College established the Granville T. Woods scholarship in memory of the inventor.

In 2004, the New York City Transit Authority organized an exhibition on Woods that utilized bus and train depots and an issue of four million MetroCards commemorating the inventor&#x27;s work on third rail electrification.

In 2006, Woods was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

In 2008, the corner of Stillwell and Mermaid Avenues in Brooklyn was named &quot;Granville T. Woods Way&quot; to honor Woods. Its location is situated across Stillwell Avenue, opposite the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue rail and bus terminal.

<doc id="395195" wikidata="Q1616241" url="?curid=395195" title="Liberian English">
<text>Liberian English refers to the varieties of English spoken in Liberia. Four such varieties exist:
* Standard Liberian English, the Liberian variety of International English. It is the language taught in secondary and tertiary institutions. It is used in oratory and by newsreaders.
* Liberian Settler English the language of the descendants of the 16,000 African Americans who immigrated to Liberia in the nineteenth century
* Kru Pidgin English the language of Kru migrant workers and mariners. It is now moribund.
* Liberian Kreyol the creolized variety spoken by most Liberian speakers of English. It is the Liberian descendant of the West African Pidgin English that developed all along the West African coast in the eighteenth century. It has been significantly influenced by Liberian Settler English.

Prior to the twenty-first century, Liberians referred to all these varieties simply as &quot;English.&quot; In the present century, however, the term &quot;Kolokwa&quot; (from the English word &quot;colloquial&quot;) has become widely used.

==The sound system of English in Liberia==
The vowel system is distinct from that found in other West African variants; Standard Liberian English distinguishes from , and from , and uses the diphthongs , , and . Vowels can be nasalized. The final vowel of &quot;happy&quot; is . It favors open syllables, usually omitting syllable-final , , or a fricative. The interdental fricatives appear as in syllable-initial position (such as &quot;thing&quot; and &quot;this&quot; having respective pronunciations of &quot;ting&quot; and &quot;dis&quot;), and as finally. The glottal fricative is preserved, as is the voiceless labio-velar fricative (in such words as &quot;whit&quot; and &quot;which&quot; in contrast to voiced in &quot;wit&quot; and &quot;wish&quot;). Except in word-initial position, affricates have lost their stop component, thus &gt; . The liquid [r] is not pronounced at the end of a word or before a consonant, making Standard Liberian English a non-rhotic dialect.

Additionally, English in Liberia includes particles that occur at the end of a clause that amplify the purpose of the clause, The most commonly occurring particle is &quot;o&quot;, which is a feature generally of Kru and Kwa languages but shows up in other neighboring Niger-Congo languages as well as in West African varieties of English more generally, including pidgins and creoles. In Liberian English (and in the other languages of the region), &quot;o&quot; emphasizes that a proposition is of current relevance to the speaker and hearer. Beyond its use to mark emphasis, &quot;o&quot; frequently occurs to correct a hearer&#x27;s mistaken assumption or to indicate what will happen next.

==Kru Pidgin English==
Kru Pidgin English is a moribund variety that was spoken by Krumen. These were individuals, most often from the Klao Bassa people and Grebo ethnic groups, who worked as sailors on ships along the West African coast and also as migrant workers and domestics in such British colonies as the Gold Coast (Ghana) and Nigeria. The Krumen tradition dates back to the end of the eighteenth century. With the end of the British colonial presence in West Africa in the mid-twentieth century, however, the tradition came to an end, and with it the ongoing use of Kru Pidgin English.

Kru Pidgin English is quite distinct from other forms of English in Liberia and has numerous unique traits. Plural marking, for instance, is done solely by the suffixal &quot;-z&quot;, while other variants will also integrate a postponed &quot;den&quot; as another plural marking form. Another feature of Kru Pidgin English, perhaps one of the most distinct, is the lack of tense-marking that even often extends to copulas in many cases. An example of the lack of tense marking is &quot;he feel hot&quot; instead of &quot;he had felt hot.&quot; When it comes to other markers, Kru Pidgin English almost exclusively has &quot;de&quot; to mark aspect, such as in the statement &quot;we de go na&quot; in the place of &quot;we had gone to.&quot;

==Kolokwa==
Prior to the twenty-first century, Liberians used the term &quot;English&quot; for all Liberian varieties with an English lexicon. However, linguists used the term &quot;Vernacular Liberian English&quot; for the variety that was generally spoken. Now Kolokwa has become the general term for this variety. Kolokwa developed from the West African Pidgin English spoken all along the West African coast. It has been significantly influenced by Liberian Settler English, the variety that African American immigrants brought to Liberia in the nineteenth century and is spoken today by the immigrants&#x27; descendants. Kolokwa phonology owes much to the Niger-Congo languages, especially those spoken along the coast, primarily such Kru languages as Bassa and Klao but also the Mande language Vai. Kolokwa has been analysed as being a post-creole continuum. As such, the term &quot;Kolokwa&quot; covers a range of ways of speaking, from quite distinct from International English to much closer to it.

== Role of English in Liberia ==
From its emergence at the beginning of the 18th century, a primary motivator for using an English-lexifier variety was its use in maritime trade. Once the Settlers arrived and asserted political dominance, English/Kolokwa attained a central role in the governance of the country and provided Liberians who did not share a Niger-Congo language with a medium for interaction. The widespread displacement of Liberians during the civil war increased the probability that individual Liberians needed to interact with other Liberians with whom they had no other language in common. Thus, the civil war can be seen to have promoted the use of English/Kolokwa. Unlike many other West African countries, English was oddly introduced to Liberia.

English has historically been central to the overall development of the country. When the Settler governments prevailed, the Department of Education adopted a policy to provide education in English. This policy was not unpopular. People wanted their children to acquire English in order to have access to the economic benefits associated with it. One adverse effect of the English-only policy was that knowledge of local languages was not prized. Individuals were assessed strictly on their ability to speak English. 

A 1999 study found that of Liberian immigrants across the United States, nearly 73 percent spoke English at home, and many children did not speak any other language. There are a few reasons attributed to this trend. Two main reasons are intertribal marriages inspiring people across tribes to have a common way to communicate and parents wanting their children to be proficient in English, especially those parents who are educated themselves. There are currently some pushing for native languages to be taught in schools as a way to preserve the culture, but these tribes do continue to have their own impact on how English is spoken across the country.

<doc id="395196" wikidata="Q1500964" url="?curid=395196" title="Variable-message sign">
<text>A variable- (also changeable-, electronic-, or dynamic-) message sign or message board, often abbreviated VMS, VMB, CMS, or DMS, and in the UK known as a matrix sign,
is an electronic traffic sign often used on roadways to give travelers information about special events. Such signs warn of traffic congestion, accidents, incidents such as terrorist attacks, AMBER/Silver/Blue Alerts, roadwork zones, or speed limits on a specific highway segment. In urban areas, VMS are used within parking guidance and information systems to guide drivers to available car parking spaces. They may also ask vehicles to take alternative routes, limit travel speed, warn of duration and location of the incidents, inform of the traffic conditions, or display general public safety messages.

==History==

VMS systems were deployed at least as early as the 1950s on the New Jersey Turnpike. The road&#x27;s signs of that period, and up to around 2012, were capable of displaying a few messages in neon, all oriented around warning drivers to slow down: &quot;REDUCE SPEED&quot;, followed by a warning of either construction, accident, congestion, ice, snow, or fog at a certain distance ahead. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority replaced those signs (along with 1990s-vintage dot-matrix VMS systems along the Garden State Parkway) with more flexible electronic signs between 2010 and 2016.

The current VMS systems are largely deployed on freeways, trunk highways, or in work zones.

On the interchange of I-5 and SR 120 in San Joaquin County, California, an automated visibility and speed warning system was installed in 1996 to warn traffic of reduced visibility due to fog (where tule fog is a common problem in the winter), and of slow or stopped traffic.

Message Signs were deployed in Ontario during the 1990s and are now being upgraded on 400-series highways as well as two pilot secondary highways in northeastern Ontario.

==Technologies and types==
Early variable message signs included static signs with words that would illuminate (often using neon tubing) indicating the type of incident that occurred, or signs that used rotating prisms (trilons) to change the message being displayed. These were later replaced by dot matrix displays typically using eggcrate, fiber optic, or flip-disc technology, which were capable of displaying a much wider range of messages than earlier static variable message signs. Since the late 1990s, the most common technology used in new installations for variable message signs are LED displays. In recent years, some newer LED variable message signs have the ability to display colored text and graphics.

Dot-matrix variable message signs are divided into three subgroups: character matrix, row matrix, and full matrix. In a character matrix VMS, each character is given its own matrix with equal horizontal spacing between them, typically with two or three rows of characters. In a full matrix VMS, the entire sign is a single large dot matrix display, allowing the display of different fonts and graphics. A row matrix VMS is a hybrid of the two types, divided into two or three rows like a character matrix display, except each row is a single long dot matrix display instead of being split per character horizontally.

Overhead variable message signs are today available in three form factors: front access, rear access, and walk-in. In a front access variable message sign, maintenance is performed by lifting the sign open from the front. Most smaller VMS are of the front access form factor, and are typically installed today on major arterials. The rear access form factor is similar to the front access form factor, except that maintenance is performed from the rear of the sign, and are commonly used for medium-sized dynamic message signs installed along the roadside of freeways (instead of overhead). The walk-in form factor is a more recent introduction, where maintenance on the sign is performed from the inside of the sign. A key advantage of the walk-in form factor is that lane closures are generally not required to perform maintenance on the sign. Most of the largest VMS units installed today are walk-in units, and are typically installed overhead on freeways. 

The NJ Turnpike Authority counts five unique types of variable message signs under its jurisdiction, at least one of which has been replaced by newer signs. They are:

#&quot;REDUCE SPEED&quot; neon signs (1950s-2010, obsolete, have now been replaced).
#&quot;Changeable message signs&quot; (trilon/ rotating-drum signs that can be used for closing roads or moving traffic to other roadways).
#Electronic VMS: signs with remotely controlled messages displayed on them; the messages are sent from the State Traffic Management Center, updating the signs automatically.
#Variable speed limit signs - used for varying the posted speed limits within work zones and in emergencies.
#Portable VMS: movable &quot;electronic VMS&quot;. A portable VMS has much the same characteristics as a fixed electronic VMS, but can be moved from location to location as the need dictates.

==Usage==

Early models required an operator to be physically present when programming a message, whereas newer models may be reprogrammed remotely via a wired or wireless network or cellphone connection.

A complete message on a panel generally includes a problem statement indicating incident, roadwork, stalled vehicle etc.; a location statement indicating where the incident is located; an effect statement indicating lane closure, delay, etc. and an action statement giving suggestion what to do traffic conditions ahead. These signs are also used for Amber alert messages, and in some states, Silver and Blue Alert messages.

In some places, VMSes are set up with permanent, semi-static displays indicating predicted travel times to important traffic destinations such as major cities or interchanges along the route of a highway.

Typical messages provide the following information:

*Promotional messages about services provided by a road authority during non-critical hours, such as carpooling efforts, travelers&#x27; information stations and 5-1-1 lines
*Crashes, including vehicle spin-out or rollover
*Road Works
*Incidents affecting normal traffic flow in a lane or on shoulders
*Non-recurring congestion, often a residual effect of cleared crash
*Closures of an entire road, e.g. over a mountain pass in winter.
*Exit ramp closures
*Debris on roadway
*Vehicle fires
*Wildfires
*Short-term maintenance or construction lasting less than three days
*Pavement failure alerts
*AMBER, Silver, and Blue Alerts, as well as weather warnings via the warning infrastructure of NOAA Weather Radio&#x27;s SAME system
*Travel times
*Variable speed limits
*Car park occupancy levels
*speed sign, for recommending a speed to approach the next traffic light in its green phase.

The information comes from a variety of traffic monitoring and surveillance systems. It is expected that by providing real-time information on special events on the oncoming road, VMS can improve motorists&#x27; route selection, reduce travel time, mitigate the severity and duration of incidents and improve the performance of the transportation network.
* Do not enter the motorway when the red lamps are flashing in pairs from side to side.

==Safety messages for drivers==
Increasingly, signs have been used to remind drivers to buckle seat belts (&quot;Click it or ticket&quot;), obey the speed limit, and stay off the road if impaired (&quot;Drive sober or get pulled over&quot;). In a federal study, a slight majority of drivers reported that public safety messages on dynamic message signs impacted their driving behaviors.

The Ohio Department of Transportation began using humorous dynamic message signs in 2015, perplexing some drivers. 
Examples of humorous signs seen in New Jersey, Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Iowa, New York, Minnesota and Ohio include:
*&quot;Hold on to your butts. Help prevent forest fires.&quot;
*&quot;We&#x27;ll be blunt. Don&#x27;t drive high.&quot; 
*&quot;Visiting in-laws? Slow down, get there late.&quot;
*&quot;Only sparklers should be lit.&quot; and “Don’t drive Star Spangled hammered.&quot;(for Fourth of July)
*&quot;Hocus pocus – drive with focus.&quot; and &quot;Slow down in work zones - my mummy works here.&quot; (for Halloween)
*&quot;Drive Drunk and YULE be sorry.&quot; and “You’re not a Christmas tree. Don’t drive lit.&quot; 
*&quot;HO HO HO, please drive slow.&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t be a grinch, let them merge.&quot;
*&quot;Reckless drivers are worse than fruitcake.&quot; 
*&quot;Only Rudolph should be lit.&quot; and &quot;Santa&#x27;s watching, put down the phone.&quot;
*“I’m just a sign asking drivers to use turn signals.”
*“Seatbelts always pass a vibe check.”
*“Come on, Eileen… your speed is obscene.&quot;
*“May the 4th be with you, text I will not.”
*&quot;Irish you would slow down.&quot;
*&quot;I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes.&quot;
*&quot;Nice car, did it come with a turn signal?&quot; and &quot;Get your head out of your apps.&quot;
*&quot;100 is the temperature - not the speed limit.&quot;
*“Let’s go Barbie, Buckle Up. Yes. You Ken!” and “Fast &amp; Furious? Nope! Slow &amp; Cautious.”

In 2024, concerns that these messages were distracting drivers led the Federal Highway Administration to strongly discourage signs with &quot;obscure meanings, references to pop culture&quot; or humor.

==Movable versions==
Truck-mounted VMSes (also called Portable Changeable Message Signs or PCMS) are sometimes dispatched by highway agencies such as Caltrans to warn traffic of incidents such as accidents in areas where permanent VMSes are not available or near enough as a preventive measure for reducing secondary accidents. They are often deployed in pairs so that the second VMS truck can take over when the traffic queue overtakes the first truck, requiring the first truck to reposition further upstream from the queue, to be effective. An optional third truck, the team leader, may be utilized for driving by and monitoring the incident itself, traffic patterns and delay times, to make strategic decisions for minimizing delays—analogous to spotter planes used in fighting forest fires.

Trailer-mounted variable-message signs are used to alter traffic patterns near work zones, and for traffic management for special events, natural disasters, and other temporary traffic patterns. The messages displayed on the sign can be programmed locally on the unit&#x27;s control panel, or units equipped with a cellular modem can be programmed remotely via computer or phone. Most manufacturers produce trailers which comply with the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation System Protocol (NTCIP) which allows the portable trailer to be integrated with an intelligent transportation system. Trailer-mounted VMS can be equipped with radar, cameras, and other sensing devices as part of a smart work zone deployment..

==In popular culture==
A variable-message sign figures significantly into the plot of the 1991 film &quot;L.A. Story&quot;.

<text>Elisha Graves Otis (August 3, 1811 – April 8, 1861) was an American industrialist and founder of the Otis Elevator Company. In 1853, he invented a safety device that prevents elevators from falling if the hoisting cable fails. On March 23, 1857, he installed the first safety elevator for passenger service in the store of E.V. Haughwout &amp; Co. in New York City.

==Biography==

Otis was born in Halifax, Vermont, to Stephen Otis and Phoebe Glynn. He moved away from home at the age of 19, eventually settling in Troy, New York, where he lived for five years employed as a wagon driver. In 1834, he married Susan A. Houghton. They had two children, Charles and Norton. Later that year, Otis suffered a terrible case of pneumonia which nearly killed him, but he earned enough money to move his wife and three-year-old son to the Vermont Hills on the Green River. He designed and built his own gristmill, but did not earn enough money from it, so he converted it into a sawmill, yet still did not attract customers. Now having a second son, he started building wagons and carriages, at which he was fairly skilled. His wife later died, leaving Otis with two sons, one age 8 and the other in infancy.

In 1845 he moved to Albany, New York, where he worked as a master mechanic in a bedstead factory. During this period he invented a railway safety brake. By 1852 he had moved to Yonkers, New York to work at the Maize &amp; Burns bedstead factory installing machinery. The factory needed a hoist to lift heavy equipment to the upper floor, but this posed serious safety issues. In response, Otis invented the safety elevator, which automatically comes to a halt if the hoisting rope breaks. The following year he left the factory and started his own company, the Otis Elevator Company. After giving a public demonstration of his new invention at the New York Crystal Palace in 1854, demand for the safety elevator began to rise. He installed the first safety elevator for passenger service at the E. V. Haughwout Building in New York City in 1857.

In his spare time, he designed and experimented with his old designs of bread-baking ovens and train brakes, and patented a steam plow in 1857, a rotary oven in 1858, and, with Charles, the oscillating steam engine in 1860. The plough was not commercially successful. 

Otis contracted diphtheria and died on April 8, 1861, aged 49. He was buried in Oakland Cemetery in Yonkers, New York.

==Legacy==
An Otis Elevator Company worker coined the term &quot;escalator&quot; to refer to continuous-loop moving staircases that could either ascend or descend. The company was acquired by United Technologies in 1976. In April 2020, Otis Elevators Company was spun off from United technology to be an independent elevator company.

The WWII-era U.S. Liberty ship SS &quot;Elisha Graves Otis&quot; was named for him.

<doc id="395207" wikidata="Q2087612" url="?curid=395207" title="Tucows">
<text>Tucows Inc. is an American-Canadian publicly traded Internet services and telecommunications company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and incorporated in Pennsylvania, United States. The company is composed of three independent businesses: Tucows Domains, Ting Internet, and Wavelo.

Originally founded in 1993 as a shareware and freeware software download site, Tucows shuttered its downloads business in 2021. Tucows Domains is the second-largest domain registrar worldwide and operates OpenSRS, Ascio, and Hover.

In 2012, Tucows launched Ting Mobile, a wireless service provider and used the same brand to launch its fiber Internet provider business Ting Internet in 2015. In 2020, Tucows sold its wireless business to Dish Network, while they continued to operate Ting Internet. The billing platform Tucows built for Ting Mobile was spun off into an independent OSS/BSS SaaS business, Wavelo.

The company was formed in Flint, Michigan, United States, in 1993. The Tucows logo was two cow heads, a play on the homophone &quot;two cows&quot;.

== Origins ==
Scott Swedorski, a Flint native, started working as a computer lab manager at Flint&#x27;s Mott Community College in 1991. By late 1992, Swedorski left Mott College to work at the Genesee County Library System as a system administrator for FALCON (Flint Area Library Cooperative Online Network) and saw a need to bring shareware reviews to the public. In 1993 he formed TUCOWS (The Ultimate Collection Of Winsock Software) leading all editorial, reviews, HTML programming and scripting.

==Company history==
In the early 1990s, Tucows was hosted on university and public servers (much like Yahoo! and Google were in their early stages). TUCOWS&#x27; mission was to provide users with downloads of both freeware and trial versions of shareware. Internet Direct, owned and operated by John Nemanic, Bill Campbell, and Colin Campbell, acquired Tucows in 1996. STI Ventures acquired Tucows in 1999.

The company employed roughly 30 employees in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 with additional employees in Canada. For several years Scott Swedorski personally oversaw day-to-day activity in the Flint office located in the White House building on Beecher Road.

In 2000, Tucows acquired &quot;Linux Weekly News&quot; (which was then &quot;unacquired&quot; in 2002).

In 2001, Tucows was acquired by Infonautics, which then changed its name to Tucows, a business tactic called a &quot;reverse takeover&quot;. On August 26, 2002, Tucows sold eLibrary and Encyclopedia.com, its search and reference services properties inherited from Infonautics, to Alacritude. 
Internet Archive preserves a full copy of the Tucows Software Library, with thousands of software titles both in the latest versions, as well as in older versions not yet available through Tucows.

In 2004, Tucows acquired Boardtown Corporation, a billing software provider based in Starkville, Mississippi.

On August 19, 2005, Tucows went public, after completing a secondary offering, listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange as TC and the NASDAQ as TCX.

In January 2006, Tucows completed its acquisition of certain assets of Critical Path, an outsourced email services provider.

In June 2006 Tucows paid $18 million to purchase Mailbank.com Inc, a company that owns over 17,000 domain names for common surnames, such as smith.net and brown.org. Mailbank generates income from ads on its websites (from domain parking) and also from customers who want e-mail accounts with their surname in the domain name.

On June 15, 2006, Noss disclosed that the portfolio of NetIdentity&#x27;s domain names acquired by Tucows represents at least 68% of surnames in the United States and Europe, and that the cost of the acquisition was $18 million. On February 19, 2008, Tucows announced that they were launching a &quot;Personal Names Service&quot; using their portfolio of 39,000 domain names. &quot;The launch of the Personal Names Service marks the complete integration of the surname assets we acquired with NetIdentity into our wholesale channel&quot;, said Elliot Noss, President and CEO of Tucows.

On August 26, 2006, Tucows won an eBay auction for the web calendar site Kiko.com. The company planned to roll Kiko&#x27;s features into their existing email platform.

On July 27, 2007, Tucows acquired ItsYourDomain.com (IYD), another privately held ICANN-accredited wholesale registrar offering domain services through a network of over 2,500 affiliates with over 700,000 domains under management, paying US$10.35 million. ItsYourDomain.com managed 699,951 domains compared to Tucows&#x27;s 5,919,987, at the time of the sale in July 2007 ItsYourDomain.com&#x27;s monthly growth of 29,181 exceeded Tucows growth of 21,126.

By June 2008, Tucows had a total of three domain name registration services called ItsYourDomain (IYD), NetIdentity, and DomainDirect. Tucows decided to discontinue these three services, and merge them into one new domain name registration service, called Hover. Hover is a simple domain name registration service powered by Tucows Inc, that started in July 2008. All IYD, DomainDirect, and NetIdentity customers are fulfilled by Hover.com.

On November 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they were launching Butterscotch.com, an online video network with video tutorials to explain Internet technology, starting with 35 video tutorials and plans to reach 500 clips by Spring 2009. On October 14, 2011, Butterscotch.com producer Sean Carruthers stated production had been shut down.

In December 2014, Tucows launched RealNames, offering e-mail service using domain names acquired from Mailbank.com Inc.

On January 20, 2017, the company acquired eNom for $83.5 million, making Tucows the second-largest domain registrar in the world.

The company announced in January 2021 it was shuttering its Downloads business, as it was no longer essential to the rest of the company&#x27;s business, but had transferred all of its assets and content to the Internet Archive prior to its closure.

==Business lines==
In July 2008, Tucows rebranded its wholesale services as &quot;Open SRS&quot;.

As of July 2023, Tucows is the third-largest accredited registrar in the world.

===Domain portfolio management===
Tucows has three sources of income from its domain portfolio: 1) Advertising from pages of domains within their domain name portfolio; 2) Sales of domains from their portfolio, which is constantly being replenished; 3) Auction of the steady stream of thousands of domain names that expire every day and become available for resale.

On November 14, 2007, Tucows disclosed that they offer pay-per-click advertising on the pages of domains within their domain name portfolio. When a user types one of these domain names into the address of the browser (direct navigation), they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay-per-click advertising. Every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page, it generates revenue for Tucows through its partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay-per-click results.

On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that it had switched from Google Ads to a new advertising partner in 2007, which led to a one-third increase in its revenue.

On May 7, 2008, Tucows announced it put a process in place for the regular sale of direct navigation names. These domain names would come from names that expire each month from customers who decide they no longer want the domain names and that Tucows is able to select the ones they want to keep from these domain names.

Tucows announced on June 12, 2008, that they have reached an agreement with Afternic to auction Tucows’ large daily inventory of expired domain names. &quot;We have over eight million domains under management and thousands expiring every day, so this deal provides us with a great way to share revenue with our resellers while participating in Afternic’s popular secondary domain name marketplace”, said Bill Sweetman, General Manager of Tucows Domain Portfolio. Tucows will share 10% of the gross sale price with the reseller for the sale of expired domains that were originally registered through the reseller. Revenue will be shared automatically without the reseller having to take any additional action. Tucows chose Afternic as a partner even though SnapNames with Register.com and NameJet with NetSol/eNom are the dominant players in expired domains.

On October 29, 2008, Tucows announced that it would begin direct sales from their inventory of premium domain names under the brand name of Yummy Names. The service was created especially for marketers to obtain a high-quality domain name from Tucows inventory. Customers have the option of purchasing a premium domain name outright or leasing the name. In 2009 one of Tucows&#x27; subsidiaries, Buydomains Holdings, sold another premium domain name for a record $50,000 for Myhomepage.com.

On February 20, 2008, Tucows announced a portfolio of over 1,000 domain names that have the high potential value such as &quot;Jewellers.com&quot;, &quot;Actresses.com&quot;, &quot;BasketballPlayers.com&quot;, and &quot;ProjectManagers.com&quot;.

In February 2008, Tucows successfully defended against an arbitration proceeding over Batchelor.com, which it had acquired as part of its NetIdentity purchase. The complaint had been filed by Ken Batchelor Cadillac Company, a car dealership. A National Arbitration Forum panel determined that the dealership had not established rights in the mark &quot;Batchelor&quot;. In fact, Tucows has won all surname-related arbitration proceedings.

In 2007, Weidner Investment Services filed a complaint claiming that Weidner was its trademark or service mark and asked the National Arbitration Forum to order the transfer of Weidner.com from Tucows to Weidner. Tucows failed to respond, and the National Arbitration Forum ordered Tucows to transfer Weidner.com to Weidner Investment Services.

In January 2017, eNom was sold to Canadian domain seller Tucows for $83.5M Canadian.

===Email services===
Tucows provides millions of email boxes through their network of over 9,000 service providers. Customers of Tucows fully hosted email service are provided with POP3, IMAP, WAP and webmail access. Providers using Tucows Email Service have the option of using Tucows&#x27; spam and virus filtering with their current email infrastructure.

As part of the NetIdentity acquisition, Tucows had problems migrating retail customers&#x27; email from a third-party provider to Tucows in-house mail systems in September 2006.

Starting August 12, 2008, Tucows Email Service running on their servers designated as Cluster A experienced a multi-day outage lasting until August 15, 2008. On October 6, 2008, Cluster A again suffered another multi-day outage affecting at least 50% of users and at times all users. As of the afternoon of October 9, 2008, this cluster was still partially down (&quot;degraded&quot;) preventing an unknown number of users from being able to retrieve email.

===Retail services===
Tucows sells services to consumers and small businesses and offers personalized email through net identity. Tucows also offers customers hosting and other services with NetIdentity. Tucows also expected to receive income for pay per click advertising revenue from domain parking the surnames.

===Mobile phone services===
In February 2012, Tucows launched a new mobile virtual network operator in the United States known as Ting, which resells voice and data services on the T-Mobile US network. As of July 2018, the service had approximately 286,000 subscribers.

In 2017, Tucows acquired Canadian MVNO Roam Mobility from Otono Networks. Roam Mobility ran for three years until it was shut down in June 2020, likely due to travel slowdown from the COVID-19 pandemic.

On August 3, 2020, Tucows announced that it would sell the Ting Mobile business to Dish Network (owner of Boost Mobile) and serve as its provider of backend services for its new wireless businesses.

As of 2022, Tucows no longer runs its mobile phone service and has shifted focus to software enablement for other providers.

===Internet services===
On December 15, 2014, Tucows announced its acquisition of the Charlottesville, Virginia ISP Blue Ridge InternetWorks, which was building a fiber to the home network. The services were brought under Tucows&#x27; Ting branding. They began offering symmetrical gigabit fiber internet without bandwidth caps. Since expanding the existing fiber network in Charlottesville, Ting Internet is currently in 12 markets with more on the way.

=== Software (SaaS) ===
In January 2022, Tucows launched Wavelo, a software as a service (SaaS) company that builds telecom billing and operations software for Mobile Virtual Network Operators and Fiber Internet Services. They have two products: MONOS (Mobile Network Operating System) currently used by Dish Network and ISOS (Internet Services Operating System) currently used by Ting Internet.

==De-emphasis and divestment of business lines==

===De-emphasis of software downloads===
Tucows maintained a download archive that included more than 30,000 software titles in its worldwide network of partner sites. Although some listing features now have fees, basic listing remains free. Tucows founder Scott Swedorski announced his resignation in November 2003. On March 10, 2006, Tucows Content division closed its satellite office located in Flint, Michigan, and relocated the remaining editorial functions to its corporate head office in Toronto. On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that Tucows plans to de-emphasize the software download aspect of their business. The download service was finally closed down in January 2021.

===Divestment of web hosting accounts===
On May 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they are getting out of the web hosting business. As part of the divestment Tucows signed an agreement for Hostopia to purchase about 14,000 Domain Direct, NetIdentity and ItsYourDomain.com (IYD) customer web hosting accounts and would migrate the web hosting accounts to Hostopia&#x27;s unified web service platform by July 2008.

===Divestment of equity interest in Afilias===
On November 5, 2008, Tucows announced that it was selling its entire 7.38% equity interest in Afilias for $7.4 million. Afilias is the registry operator of the .info and .aero TLDs, and the service provider of the .org generic top-level domain (gTLD), .mobi mobile phone TLD, and a provider of domain name registry services for several countries around the world, including .AG (Antigua and Barbuda), .BZ (Belize), .GI (Gibraltar), .HN (Honduras), .IN (India), .ME (Montenegro), .SC (the Seychelles), and .VC (St. Vincent and the Grenadines).

==Reputation==

===Domain name add grace period (AGP) abuse===
On January 8, 2008, Tucows explained its values and position on domain name front running: &quot;We work to uphold the rights of Registrants. That means, for example, not putting 60-day locks on domains when a Registrant makes a change to their WHOIS information effectively locking some into a renewal and blocking domain name transfers to other Registrars. That also means having a clear, defined policy surrounding expiry and redemption periods.&quot; Tucows addresses domain tasting &quot;by charging our Resellers a monetary fee on domain name registrations that are cancelled within the five-day Add Grace Period (AGP)&quot;, but it &quot;doesn’t use WHOIS query data or search data from our API to front-run domain names&quot;.

Although it supports ICANN’s fee to discourage domain tasting and Google&#x27;s decision to drop names added and deleted during the AGP from its AdSense program, Tucows claimed that AGP abuse could be further curbed by shortening the AGP period to 12 hours or less, sufficient time for registrants to correct spelling mistakes—AGP&#x27;s original purpose.

===Registrations to sites selling illegal goods and connections to terrorism===

In 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative included Tucows on its annual &quot;notorious markets&quot; list—the first time it has named a domain name registrar—in order to set an example for what happens to registrars that do not block or suspend sites that sell illegal goods. Tucows responded that it suspended dozens of sites every day, but that &quot;unlike some competitors, it considered all complaints carefully to ensure they were justified&quot;.

Tucows used to be the domain name registrar for the notorious American imageboard 8chan, which has been delisted by Google for hosting child pornography, and also seen numerous swatting attacks and terrorist attacks announced and planned by users, notably the 2019 New Zealand Terror Attack.

It is also a domain name registrar for the social media platform Truth Social and the white nationalist website Stormfront.

in 2021, Tucows launched a framework to explain their role in dealing with domain name abuse.

<doc id="395209" wikidata="Q458251" url="?curid=395209" title="Rubén González (pianist)">
<text>Rubén González Fontanills (26 May 1919 – 8 December 2003) was a Cuban pianist. Together with Lilí Martínez and Peruchín he is said to have &quot;forged the style of modern Cuban piano playing in the 1940s&quot;.

Between the 1940s and his retirement in the 1980s, he played with Cuba&#x27;s most successful acts, including Paulina Álvarez, Arsenio Rodríguez, Orquesta América del 55, Orquesta Riverside and Enrique Jorrín. In the 1990s, he came out of retirement to play in the revival ensembles Afro-Cuban All Stars and Buena Vista Social Club, also recording solo material and performing live until 2002.

==Biography==
===Early life and career ===
González was born in Santa Clara, Cuba, on 26 May 1919. His family moved to the small village of Encrucijada when he was 6 years old. He took up the piano at age seven and graduated from the Cienfuegos Conservatory at age 15.

He grew up wanting to be a doctor and studied medicine, thinking music would remain a hobby he could pursue by night. However, he abandoned his studies after four years because music was &quot;in his blood&quot; and also because of all the encouragement he received from people around him. Thus, after graduating from high school, he began playing with groups in Cienfuegos and around the country.

=== From Havana to Venezuela ===
In 1941, González moved to Havana where he played in the charanga of danzonete singer Paulina Álvarez, as well as Orquesta Elósegui and the orchestra of the CMQ radio station. He became friends with important pianists such as René Hernández, Anselmo Sacasas, Jesús López and Facundo Rivero. He joined Arsenio Rodríguez&#x27;s conjunto in 1943, replacing Adolfo &quot;Panacea&quot; O&#x27;Reilly. Rodríguez advised him to &quot;just play your own style, whatever it is, but don&#x27;t imitate anyone&quot;. Although González&#x27;s first confirmed recordings with Arsenio&#x27;s conjunto are dated to 5 July 1945, earlier recordings might feature him, since Panacea&#x27;s last confirmed recording session took place on 16 November 1943; these recordings were all released by RCA Victor.

In 1945, he left the conjunto—and was replaced by Lilí Martínez—to go to Panama with the ensemble Estrellas Negras, comprising mostly ex-Rodríguez musicians. With the Estrellas Negras, González toured most of South America—from Mexico City to Buenos Aires—and, on his return to Cuba, he joined the Conjunto Kubavana directed by Alberto Ruiz. He also performed with the Orquesta Los Hermanos Castro which, at one time, featured Mongo Santamaría.

Between 1948 and the mid-1950s, González played with Ernesto Grenet and Senén Suárez at the Cabaret Tropicana. At the same time, he became a member of René Álvarez y Los Astros and he often played with Orquesta Gris, Orquesta Ideal de Joseíto Valdés, Orquesta Siboney de Armando Pidre, and Los Hermanos Lebatard. In 1954, he backed Rolando Laserie at the Cabaret San Souci.

In the mid-1950s, he toured Venezuela with the charanga Orquesta América del 55. He established himself in Venezuela between 1957 and 1962, in the orchestra directed by Luis Alfonso Larraín. He also briefly resided in Argentina, where he played with tango musicians. By the late 1950s, Rubén González was widely known in Cuba and other parts of Latin America.

=== Back in Havana ===
González returned to Cuba in 1961, joining the famous big band Orquesta Riverside. In 1962, he became the pianist for the Orquesta de Enrique Jorrín, and would continue to play for him for the next 25 years. In 1964, González joined Pucho Escalante&#x27;s Noneto Cubano de Jazz.

In 1975, he recorded his eponymous solo album backed by members of Jorrín&#x27;s orchestra; the album was released by Areíto as LD-3582. In 1979, he recorded the album &quot;Los héroes&quot; as part of the Estrellas de Areito all-star ensemble. After Jorrín&#x27;s death in 1987, González briefly took over the role of bandleader, but retired soon after.

===Career revival===
In 1994, Raúl Planas and Radio Progreso announcer Eduardo Rosillo approached González with the idea of recording new versions of ten songs composed by fellow Cuban pianist Lilí Martínez. The resulting album, &quot;Son Inconcluso&quot;, featured a full band including bassist Orlando &quot;Cachaíto&quot; López and Arturo &quot;Alambre dulce&quot; Harvey (ex-&quot;tresero&quot; with Conjunto Chappottín), among others, and was released in 1999 by EGREM.

In 1995, Nick Gold (head of World Circuit Records) and Juan de Marcos González (director and tres player of Sierra Maestra) decided to record a series of descarga sessions featuring classic Cuban musicians, including Rubén González on piano, together with African virtuosos Toumani Diabate (kora player) and Djelimady Tounkara (guitarist). By early 1996, the Cuban musicians had already been selected and the African musicians were about to leave for Cuba, but could not travel because of difficulties in obtaining visas. Gold then invited Ry Cooder and his son Joachim to participate in the sessions; Ry would play guitar and Joachim African percussion.

The sessions, all of which featured Rubén González on piano, took place in March 1996 in Havana&#x27;s EGREM studios. The first set of recordings was meant to revive the 1950s Cuban big band sound. This material yielded the album &quot;A Toda Cuba le Gusta&quot; credited to the Afro-Cuban All Stars and produced by Gold and Juan de Marcos, who also played tres. It again featured Orlando &quot;Cachaíto&quot; López on bass along with vocalists Ibrahim Ferrer, Pío Leyva, Manuel &quot;Puntillita&quot; Licea, Raúl Planas, Félix Baloy and José Antonio &quot;Maceo&quot; Rodríguez. Cooder also played slide guitar on Lilí Martínez&#x27;s famous son &quot;Alto Songo&quot;. In the sleeve notes, Juan de Marcos wrote: &quot;This album is dedicated to Rubén González, genius of Cuban piano&quot;.

The second set of recordings were meant to revive the acoustic sound of the 1940s Cuban trova and filin movements. It yielded the critically acclaimed &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; album. Gold was credited as executive producer, Juan de Marcos as A &amp; R consultant and Cooder as producer. Here Rubén González on piano and Cachaíto on bass accompanied singers Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer, Omara Portuondo and Eliades Ochoa. Cooder played guitar on all but one track.

In April 1996, and using left over studio time after the sessions that had produced the previous two albums, the solo album &quot;Introducing...Rubén González&quot; was recorded in just two days, live with no overdubs. All three albums were released on Nick Gold&#x27;s World Circuit Records in 1997. In early 1998, Wim Wenders filmed a documentary entitled &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, and González and his colleagues became famous worldwide.

=== Later years and death ===
Between 1997 and 2000, González recorded his next album, &quot;Chanchullo&quot;, at EGREM Studios in Havana and Angel Recording Studios in London. Some recordings he made in September 1999 at EGREM studios were released by EGREM as &quot;Rubén González and Friends&quot; in 2000. His last public appearances took place in Mexico and Cuba in 2002.

In the morning of 8 December 2003, Rubén González died at his home in Havana after a long illness which had prevented him from walking and eventually led to renal and respiratory problems. He was survived by his wife, Eneida Lima, and is buried in Havana&#x27;s Cristóbal Colón Cemetery.

== Style and legacy ==

Rubén González is considered an innovator of the son cubano piano style. The genre&#x27;s early ensembles (&quot;sextetos&quot; and &quot;septetos&quot;) lacked pianos, and these were introduced in the late 1930s by the first three conjuntos: Arsenio Rodríguez&#x27;s conjunto, Alberto Ruiz&#x27;s Conjunto Kubavana, and Conjunto Casino. González played in the former two, which made him a pioneer in the genre. Apart from the son, González had a profound knowledge of the danzón and his improvisations are characterized by harmonic subtleties. His style has been described as &quot;romantic and angular&quot;, possessing &quot;strong lyricism&quot; with characteristic &quot;swirling arpeggios&quot;.

Like his contemporary Peruchín, González was influenced by jazz, particularly by Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, which made him one of the grandfathers of Afro-Cuban jazz. His style has influenced Eddie Palmieri, amongst others.

<doc id="395213" wikidata="Q2291330" url="?curid=395213" title="Constitution of Romania">
<text>The current Constitution of Romania is the seventh permanent constitution in modern Romania&#x27;s history. It is the fundamental governing document of Romania that establishes the structure of its government, the rights and obligations of citizens, and its mode of passing laws. It stands as the basis of the legitimacy of the Romanian government. Adopted on 21 November 1991, it was approved on 8 December 1991 in a national referendum and promulgated on the same day.

The constitution was amended once by a referendum on 18 October 2003. The new text took effect on 29 October 2003.

== Structure ==
The Constitution of 1991, as revised in 2003, contains 156 articles, divided into 8 titles:
* Title I - General principles
* Title II - Fundamental rights, liberties, and duties
* Title III - Public authorities
* Title IV - The economy and public finance
* Title V - Constitutional Court
* Title VI - Euro-Atlantic integration
* Title VII - Revising the Constitution
* Title VIII - Final and transitional provisions

== Background ==
&quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot;, voted by the respective Assemblies of Moldavia and Wallachia under Imperial Russian occupation in 1831–1832, was the first organic law resembling a constitution ever awarded to the Danubian Principalities. It remained in place until 1858, when the Crimean War removed the two countries from Russian influence and confirmed the rule by several European powers first established by the Treaty of Paris; the &quot;Paris Convention&quot; of 1858 remained the governing document following the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as &quot;Domnitor&quot; (ruling prince) over the united countries (1859), but was replaced by Cuza&#x27;s own organic law, entitled &quot;Statutul dezvoltător al Convenţiei de la Paris&quot; (&quot;Statute expanding the Paris Convention&quot;), in 1864. Although the newly minted state was nominally still a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, it only acknowledged the suzerainty of the Sublime Porte in a formal way.

The first constitution of the Romanian United Principalities was adopted 1 July 1866. It was retained after Romania became a kingdom in 1881. After the extension of national territory in 1918, a new constitution was approved 29 March 1923. It was repealed by King Carol II in 1938 and replaced with a corporatist/authoritarian document with the king&#x27;s National Renaissance Front as the sole legal party. This document was, in turn, cancelled in 1940 by the National Legionary State government under Ion Antonescu and the Iron Guard. Antonescu broke his alliance with the Guard in 1941, and ruled by decree until his overthrow in 1944. The 1923 constitution was reinstated pending the adoption of a new constitution (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;).

The monarchy was abolished in 1947. In March 1948, the first constitution of Communist Romania was adopted; it was heavily modeled on the Soviet constitution. Two other constitutions appeared during the Communist era, in 1952 and 1965 (the former &quot;building socialism&quot;, the latter announcing the &quot;socialism has won&quot; and notably making the change from a &quot;people&#x27;s republic&quot; to a &quot;socialist republic&quot;). Following the collapse of the Communist regime in 1989, much of the 1965 document was suspended, though portions remained in effect until the present document was adopted in 1991.

== Initial version (1991) ==
The 1991 Constitution was composed by a committee of parliamentarians and constitutional law specialists; was approved by Parliament, meeting as a Constituent Assembly, by a vote of 414 to 95 on 21 November 1991, being published in &quot;Monitorul Oficial&quot; the same day; and was approved by referendum on 8 December 1991, with 77.3% voting in favour. The 1991 Constitution contains 7 titles and 152 articles. Romania is defined as a &quot;national, sovereign, independent, unitary and indivisible state&quot;. The form of government is a republic, headed by a president who serves a five-year term and who is eligible for a second term. The president represents the Romanian state in domestic and foreign relations, ensures obedience to the constitution and the proper functioning of state institutions, and is the guarantor of the state&#x27;s independence, unity and integrity. Parliament is &quot;the supreme representative organ of the Romanian people and the sole lawmaking authority&quot;; it is bicameral (Chamber of Deputies and Senate) and elected for four years. After the prime minister is named by the president, Parliament validates the composition and programme of the Government and can dismiss it following a motion of censure. The constitution provides for fundamental civic rights and freedoms, and creates the office of Romanian Ombudsman to ensure these are respected.

== First revision (2003) ==
The 1991 Constitution was first amended in 2003. Articles were introduced on &quot;Integration into the European Union&quot; and &quot;NATO Accession&quot;, bringing the total to 156 in 8 titles. These specified that both could take place by parliamentary vote alone, and that EU citizens living in Romania can vote and run in local elections. The revised constitution grants minorities the right to use their native language when dealing with local administration and the courts, improves the functioning of the legislative chambers (better specifying their attributes) and restricts the privilege of parliamentary immunity to political declarations, extends the president&#x27;s term to five years, explicitly &quot;guarantees&quot; rather than &quot;protects&quot; the right to private property and removes the constitutional obligation for conscription (which ended in 2006). The revised document was adopted by referendum on 18–19 October 2003; turnout was slightly above the 50%+1 threshold needed for it to be valid, with 55.7% of 17,842,103 eligible voters showing up. The opposition and NGOs alleged serious irregularities. 89.70% voted yes and 8.81%, no. It came into force ten days later.

== Proposed second revision ==
The issue of constitutional reform was raised repeatedly in the early 2010s, especially after a major political crisis in the second half of 2012. The ruling coalition at the time, the Social Liberal Union, claimed that insufficient constitutional constraints led then-incumbent President Traian Băsescu to abuse his presidential powers, thus justifying new amendments. A public debate began in 2013 and a Parliamentary Commission for the Revision of the Constitution was established. However, the reform project stalled as the Social Liberal Union dissolved in early 2014 and Băsescu ended his term later that year.

Băsescu&#x27;s successor, Klaus Iohannis, expressed support for a second revision of the Constitution, as did Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who stated that such a revision should be a political priority in 2015, as there are no elections scheduled in Romania that year. On 18 January 2015, the vice-president of the Parliamentary Commission, Valeria Schelean, requested the immediate convocation of the commission to begin working on amendments.

== 2018 referendum == 

On 6 and 7 October 2018 a referendum took place regarding the definition of the family as provided by Article 48 of the Constitution (that defines the family as being founded on the free-willed marriage &quot;between spouses&quot;), to prohibit same-sex marriage. The referendum failed as the turnout was only 21.1%, below the required voter turnout threshold of 30%.
