<text>The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a declarative language describing rules applying to Unified Modeling Language (UML) models developed at IBM and is now part of the UML standard. Initially, OCL was merely a formal specification language extension for UML. OCL may now be used with any Meta-Object Facility (MOF) Object Management Group (OMG) meta-model, including UML. The Object Constraint Language is a precise text language that provides constraint and object query expressions on any MOF model or meta-model that cannot otherwise be expressed by diagrammatic notation. OCL is a key component of the new OMG standard recommendation for transforming models, the Queries/Views/Transformations (QVT) specification.

== Description ==
OCL is a descendant of Syntropy, a second-generation object-oriented analysis and design method. The OCL 1.4 definition specified a constraint language. In OCL 2.0, the definition has been extended to include general object query language definitions.

OCL statements are constructed in four parts:

# a context that defines the limited situation in which the statement is valid 
# a property that represents some characteristics of the context (e.g., if the context is a class, a property might be an attribute)
# an operation (e.g., arithmetic, set-oriented) that manipulates or qualifies a property, and 
# keywords (e.g., if, then, else, and, or, not, implies) that are used to specify conditional expressions.

==Relation==
=== OCL and UML ===
OCL supplements UML by providing expressions that have neither the ambiguities of natural language nor the inherent difficulty of using complex mathematics. OCL is also a navigation language for graph-based models.

=== OCL and MOF ===
OCL makes a Meta-Object Facility model more precise by associating assertions with its meta-elements.

=== OCL and QVT ===
Of particular importance to Model Driven Engineering (MDE) or model-driven architecture is the notion of Model transformation. The OMG has defined a specific standard for model transformation called MOF/QVT or in short QVT. Several model transformation languages like GReAT, VIATRA, or Tefkat are presently available, with different levels of compliance with the QVT standard. Many of these languages are built on top of OCL, which is the main part of the QVT-compliance.

== Alternatives ==
Being a rule-based validation language, Schematron may be considered an alternative to OCL. However Schematron works for Extensible Markup Language (XML) trees while OCL makes it possible to navigate MOF-based models and meta-models (i.e. XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) trees). In other words, OCL relates to UML or MOF similarly to how Schematron relates to XML. (Note that Schematron uses XPath to navigate inside the XML trees.)&lt;br&gt;Being a model specification language permitting designers to decorate a model or a meta-model with side-effect-free annotations, OCL could be replaced by languages like Alloy. Automated OCL generation is in principle possible from natural language.


== Extensions ==

Eclipse OCL extends Standard OCL with additional operators and a type for Maps. AgileUML extends Standard OCL with Map and Function types. These extensions are consistent with the map and function types present in modern programming languages such as Python and Swift.

<doc id="409010" wikidata="Q505222" url="?curid=409010" title="Ron Kind">
<text>Ronald James Kind (born March 16, 1963) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1997 to 2023. He is a member of the Democratic Party. His former district is in western Wisconsin, anchored by La Crosse, Eau Claire, Platteville, Stevens Point, Wisconsin Rapids, Prescott, and River Falls. Kind was the dean of Wisconsin&#x27;s congressional delegation when he chose not to seek re-election in 2022.

==Early life, education, and career==
Kind was born and raised in La Crosse, the third of five children born to Greta and Elroy Kind. His is the fifth generation of his family to live in the area. Kind&#x27;s mother formerly worked as the assistant director of personnel in the La Crosse School District. His father had a 35-year career as a telephone repairman and union leader at the La Crosse Telephone Company.

Kind attended La Crosse schools and was a student athlete at Logan High School in both football and basketball. He accepted a scholarship to Harvard College and graduated with honors in 1985. At Harvard, Kind played quarterback on the football team and worked during the summer for Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire in Washington. While working for Proxmire, he took part in investigations that helped determine the &quot;winners&quot; of the Golden Fleece Awards, presented by Proxmire to those responsible for government waste.

Kind received a master&#x27;s degree from the London School of Economics and a J.D. degree from the University of Minnesota Law School. He practiced law for two years at Quarles and Brady, a law firm in Milwaukee.

Kind returned to La Crosse to become an assistant district attorney. He later served as a state special prosecutor in several western Wisconsin counties.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

=== Elections ===
While campaigning for an eighth term in Congress in 1994, Republican Representative Steve Gunderson announced that it would be his last. Kind, then an assistant district attorney in La Crosse, moved quickly to set up a campaign operation. In April 1995, he took a leave of absence from the district attorney&#x27;s office and by June he boasted an extensive campaign operation across the district. In September 1995, Kind announced his candidacy. A yearlong, five-way Democratic primary contest ensued; Kind won the September 1996 primary election with 46% of the vote. In the general election, he faced Republican James Harsdorf, a former Wisconsin state senator. At the time of the 1996 election, only two Democrats had represented Wisconsin&#x27;s 3rd congressional district during the 20th century and only one in the last 88 years; the election was hotly contested with national political figures appearing in support of both candidates. Kind&#x27;s campaign attacked Harsdorf for his stated support for polarizing national Republican leaders such as Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey, and used it to link him to unpopular Republican policies such as cutting Medicare; Harsdorf bashed Kind as &quot;another lawyer running for Congress.&quot; Kind defeated Harsdorf with 52% of the vote. He didn&#x27;t face another contest nearly that close until 2010.

====2006====

In 2006, Kind faced a surprise primary challenge from La Crosse activist Charles &quot;Chip&quot; DeNure, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 2001 and had flirted with several other mayoral campaigns. He challenged Kind over the Iraq War, with DeNure declaring his support for a timetable to withdraw American forces. DeNure also claimed the September 11 attacks were &quot;an inside job by terrorists within the U.S. government.&quot; Kind won 83% of the primary vote and went on to defeat Republican Paul R. Nelson with 65% of the vote in the general election.

====2010====

In late 2009, Kind considered running for governor of Wisconsin in 2010 but ultimately said that instead he would push in Congress for health care reform. Of his decision to run for reelection, Kind said: &quot;My first responsibility must be to get affordable and accessible health care reform passed this year for all Wisconsin families. That is why I cannot run for governor. I have a responsibility and duty to the people of Wisconsin to continue work on the health care reform agenda ahead of us.&quot; The &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; reported that he had given up on running for governor &quot;after a poll showed that few Wisconsinites knew him.&quot;

Amid the difficult and controversial passage of the Affordable Care Act and the Tea Party protests of 2009 and 2010, Wisconsin media described Kind as facing &quot;what is widely considered his toughest re-election challenge.&quot; His Republican opponent, state senator Dan Kapanke, who represented much of the central portion of the district, &quot;focused almost exclusively on three core Republican issues—less spending, lower taxes, and smaller government.&quot; Kapanke also criticized Kind for allegedly soliciting thousands of dollars in 2007 from a group of Eau Claire doctors. Despite a national Republican wave, which also saw Republicans win every statewide office in Wisconsin, Kind survived the challenge from Kapanke with just over 50% of the vote.

====2012====

There was talk that Kind might run for the U.S. Senate in 2012 to replace the retiring Herb Kohl, but he decided not to mount a primary challenge to fellow U.S. Representative Tammy Baldwin, who had already announced her candidacy. There was also a push to draft Kind to run for governor against Scott Walker in the 2012 gubernatorial recall election.

Kind ultimately decided to run for reelection to Congress. He faced retired U.S. Army Colonel Ray Boland in the November election and won with 64% of the vote.

====2016====

In 2016, seeking his 11th term in Congress, Kind faced a primary challenge from Eau Claire teacher Myron Buchholz. Buchholz was an outspoken supporter of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who had been defeated in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries but had carried Kind&#x27;s congressional district in the Wisconsin presidential primary. Kind said, &quot;I think that people have gotten to know me. I will not apologize for trying to find common ground in divided government&quot;, and defended his support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an issue that was polarizing working-class voters. Kind defeated Buchholz, 81% to 19%, in the primary, and faced no Republican challenger in the general election.

====2018====

In April 2017, &quot;The Hill&quot; reported that Kind was a &quot;prime target&quot; for Republicans in the 2018 elections. The article cited a number of concerns for Kind, including that President Donald Trump had carried his district in the 2016 presidential election. &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot; also cited Kind&#x27;s district as the 25th most Republican-trending district held by a Democrat. Kind was also facing criticism over the fact that a veteran who had died after taking an off-label mixture of pills prescribed to him by the Tomah VA had previously contacted Kind&#x27;s congressional office.

Kind also faced a potential primary challenge in 2018 from LGBTQ advocate Juliet Germanotta, who described herself as transgender, HIV positive, and a democratic socialist, but in February 2018, she was charged on an outstanding warrant in New York City for the theft of a $4,800 ring. Germanotta ultimately failed to gather enough signatures to appear on the primary ballot, and Kind avoided a primary.

Despite Republican hopes for the district, Kind was easily reelected, defeating Republican Steve Toft with 59% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Kind was the House Democrats&#x27; Chief Deputy Whip under Steny Hoyer. He was co-founder of both the Upper Mississippi River Congressional Caucus and the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus, and chair of the New Democrat Coalition. He voted with his party 87% of the time in the 112th Congress and 94% of the time in the 111th Congress. During the 114th Congress Kind was ranked the 19th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives and the most bipartisan member of the House from Wisconsin in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy. The index ranks members of Congress by bipartisanship by measuring how often their bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and how often they co-sponsor bills by members of the opposite party.

After the failed effort to unseat Governor Scott Walker in a June 2012 recall election, Kind said that Democrats should be proud of forcing recall elections despite the outcome. He said that his conversations with voters had convinced him that the only reason that Democrats lost was that people didn&#x27;t think it was a proper use of the recall process.

Kind opposed Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s bids for Speaker of the House in both 2006 and 2018. After winning control of the House in 2006, Pelosi asked Kind to resign from his position as Chief Deputy Whip. In 2018, as Democrats were again poised to win a majority, he again noted his opposition, saying to &quot;The Hill&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve been consistent in saying we&#x27;re in desperate need of new leadership on both sides, as we move forward in the new Congress.&quot; Kind followed through on his election pledge to oppose Pelosi and voted instead for Congressman John Lewis in the election for Speaker in 2019.

On December 18, 2019, Kind voted for both articles of impeachment against President Trump.

====Agricultural issues====
Representing some of the country&#x27;s most productive dairy farms, Kind has for many years supported reforms to U.S. agricultural subsidy programs. In 2007, he upset Democratic House leaders by co-sponsoring—with Republican congressman Jeff Flake—a bill that would have eliminated subsidies for those earning over $250,000 while increasing funding for conservation and rural development. At the time, the bill split the Democratic caucus, which had previously agreed to a similar bill which set the cutoff at $1,000,000—in order to placate rural farm-state Democrats. Pelosi, who had worked to make the original bill accommodating for those rural Democratic interests, was upset with Kind&#x27;s proposal. Agricultural Committee Chairman Collin Peterson said Kind was &quot;a lone ranger on this, and he&#x27;s dividing the caucus, and I don&#x27;t appreciate it.&quot; Kind&#x27;s proposal was ultimately referred to committee and never voted on.

====Childhood obesity====
Kind and Colorado Senator Mark Udall introduced the Healthy Kids Outdoors Act, aimed at encouraging and supporting children&#x27;s outdoor activities. He has been the House sponsor of the FIT Kids Act for the last several House sessions. The act would require school districts to report on students&#x27; physical activity and to give youngsters health and nutritional information.

In 2011, Kind wrote a piece about &quot;the childhood obesity epidemic&quot;, in which he promoted both the FIT Kids Act and the Healthy Kids Outdoors Act. He said that healthy bodies lead to healthy minds, and that his FIT Kids Act would push parents and the public by requiring states and school districts to report on children&#x27;s physical activity. As for the Healthy Kids Outdoors Act, it &quot;provides state-level incentives to develop five-year state strategies to connect children, youth and families with nature and promote outdoor recreation in communities.&quot;

====Environment====

In October 2017, Kind announced a plan to protect the Mississippi River. It involved &quot;four main parts: creating jobs by supporting recreation, tourism and navigation; maintaining railroad safety; supporting the Mississippi River Restoration Program; and promoting the &#x27;Conservation on the Farm&#x27; bill&quot;.

====Gun control====
During his 2012 campaign, Kind opposed any form of enhanced gun control, but after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting he seemed to be open to it, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re going to have to have a discussion while also keeping in mind the concerns of law-abiding, safety-conscious gun owners in America.&quot; He added, &quot;I just don&#x27;t see where armed guards or teachers with guns in our schools means freedom for our children.&quot;

WIZM reported in February 2018 that Kind was one of a relatively small number of Democrats who had received contributions from the National Rifle Association of America. Since 2009, he had accepted $7,950 in from various NRA political action committees. He had also collected $5,400 from the Connecticut-based National Shooting Sports Foundation, which calls itself &quot;The Firearms Industry Trade Association.&quot; The NRA endorsed Kind in 2010.

Kind was one of two Democrats to vote against HR 1446: Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021, designed to close the so-called Charleston loophole. Earlier he had voted in favor of HR 8: Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 to expand background checks on gun purchases. Both bills passed the House on March 11, 2021.

In June 2022, Kind was the only Democrat to vote against a measure establishing AMBER Alert-like systems for active shooter events. He again voted against the measure when it came up the following month and was again the only Democrat to do so. In a statement, Kind said he is &quot;concerned that a system like this could generate more chaos and cause armed civilians to rush to the scene, potentially interfering with law enforcement efforts.&quot;

On July 29, 2022, Kind and four other Democrats joined the Republicans in voting against a bill banning assault weapons.

====Health care====
Kind supported and voted for the Affordable Care Act, denying at a public event that insurers were canceling insurance. Rather, they were signing customers up &quot;with new plans that are compliant with ACA.&quot; He insisted that under five percent of the population would lose their insurance under Obamacare and that most would &quot;get a much better deal in the healthcare exchange—good price and much better benefits than what they were paying before.&quot; He added that young people are &quot;probably going to get a real good deal&quot; under Obamacare.

Kind voted against the 2017 Republican health care bill. &quot;I thought it was a bad piece of legislation,&quot; he said, &quot;both in the process of how it came together and the impact it will have for people back home.&quot;

====Immigration====
In October 2014, Kind said he supported &quot;comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders, helps our farmers and businesses meet their labor needs, and fairly addresses the millions of undocumented individuals in the shadows.&quot; On October 20, 2017, Kind spoke up in defense of DACA, saying that Dreamers &quot;are as American as anyone else&#x27;s children.&quot;

When then-presidential candidate Donald Trump called in 2015 for temporarily banning all Muslims from entering the United States, Kind said Trump was &quot;playing in the same huddle as ISIS” and was making ISIS recruiting easier by playing into the terrorist group&#x27;s narrative.

In January 2017, Kind issued a statement in which he maintained that &quot;President Trump&#x27;s Executive Order blocking refugees and people from select Muslim countries from entering the United States does not reflect who we are as a nation. We cannot start discriminating based on religion. Instead of helping keep our country safe it will jeopardize our national security by giving ISIS and other terror groups another recruitment tool and making it harder for our allies in Muslim nations to work with us on counter-terrorism operations.&quot;

====Marijuana legalization====
Kind has evolved on the issue of marijuana legalization. While running for reelection in 2014, he indicated his support for medical marijuana, but opposed &quot;the full legalization of recreational marijuana.&quot; He also said, &quot;Colorado and Washington State have taken the lead to decriminalize marijuana. We should watch those experiments closely before deciding to legalize recreational marijuana nationally.&quot; When the House of Representatives considered a stand-alone bill for the legalization of marijuana in December 2020, Kind voted in favor.

====Taxation and retirement====
In 2017, Kind rejected the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as a rehash of failed trickle-down economics policies. He indicated he personally supported tax reform to simplify the tax code, but accused Republicans of blowing up the deficit in their rush to cut taxes for their corporate allies, saying the Republican plan would lead to future cuts to Medicare and Social Security and would not invigorate the economy.

Kind was an early co-sponsor of the bipartisan SECURE Act of 2019, which contained a number of provisions to expand access to retirement planning options and to encourage employers to set up retirement plans for workers. The bill, originally introduced in late March 2019, was enacted in December 2019 as part of the fiscal year 2020 federal appropriations bill.

====Trade====
Kind was the lone Wisconsin Democrat to support free trade with China, despite pressure from unions that claimed trade with China is costing jobs.

The &quot;La Crosse Tribune&quot; reported in January 2014 that Kind was coming &quot;under increasing criticism from those on the left who say his support of new free-trade agreements will kill jobs.&quot; For example, he urged fellow House members to vote for the Trans-Pacific Partnership—a comprehensive agreement with 11 other Pacific nations. At the Democratic National Convention, protesters criticized Kind for his support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. &quot;There&#x27;s confusion; people are conflating trade with trade agreements&quot;, Kind insisted. &quot;The trade that&#x27;s going on absent trade agreements has not worked well for us: China, Brazil, India. We don&#x27;t have trade agreements with those countries.&quot; Ultimately, at Trump&#x27;s direction, the U.S. withdrew from consideration of the TPP, and the remaining members consolidated the agreement into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which came into force in 2018, forming one of the largest trading blocs globally.

====Veterans issues====
Kind announced in May 2014 that he would ask for the establishment of an independent bipartisan commission to investigate conditions at VA hospitals.

====War on Terrorism====
On October 10, 2002, Kind voted for the Authorization to use military force against Iraq. He later expressed regret for that vote, saying in 2008, &quot;It was the wrong war at the wrong time for the wrong reason&quot;, and in 2016, &quot;My great regret is that if you look at the Iraq resolution that we had to vote on, there were multiple steps that had to be taken before the use of force. My great regret is realizing now that President Bush wasn&#x27;t interested in those steps. He ordered the troops in when it wasn&#x27;t a last resort.&quot;

In a January 2007 letter to President Bush, Kind and a dozen-odd other members of Congress wrote that success in Iraq &quot;requires regional cooperation and positive engagement from all neighboring states. The history of the Middle East is too vast, too complex and too tumultuous to expect progress without an integrated diplomatic effort and multinational support from all of Iraq&#x27;s neighbors. History is replete with centuries of marked violence and failed crusades, perpetrated by ignorance, arrogance and dogma.&quot;

In September 2014, Kind said that he opposed &quot;sending any military combat troops in order to deal with ISIS,&quot; but expressed support for President Obama&#x27;s &quot;decisions to use targeted airstrikes in Syria and Iraq to degrade and destroy ISIS, and to send service members to assist Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training and intelligence.&quot;

==Retirement==
Kind announced on August 10, 2021, that he would not seek re-election in 2022. Having won the 2020 general election by only about three percentage points, compared to a 20-point win in 2018, and facing a rematch with his 2020 Republican opponent (and ultimate successor) Derrick Van Orden, Kind told reporters, &quot;I&#x27;ve run out of gas.&quot;

==Personal life==
Kind and his wife, Tawni, live in La Crosse. She is an official court reporter for the County Court system. They have two sons.

Kind is a member of the La Crosse Optimists Club, a leader in the Boys and Girls Club, and the La Crosse YMCA. He is also on the board of directors for Coulee Council on Alcohol or Other Drug Abuse.

On February 6, 2023, Kind joined the law firm Arnold &amp; Porter as a senior policy advisor.

Kind was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2023 Special Honours for services to UK/US relations.

==Controversies==
===Rangel ethics probe===
In October 2009, &quot;The Hill&quot; profiled Kind, focusing on his challenge to &quot;the Democratic status quo.&quot; While calling him &quot;an influential voice on...ethics,&quot; &quot;The Hill&quot; also noted that Kind had refused to join in the effort that year to have Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel step down amid an ethics probe involving Rangel&#x27;s taxes. &quot;We&#x27;re all ultimately human and none of us are perfect and we&#x27;re all prone to mistakes from time to time&quot;, Kind said. &quot;If that becomes that new standard--that any mistake is subject to dismissal or losing their position--then that&#x27;s going to be a very tough standard for each and every member to have to live up to.&quot;

===Pay-for-talk controversy===
In October 2010, two doctors at the OakLeaf Surgical Hospital in Eau Claire charged that Kind had demanded campaign donations before meeting them to discuss the Children&#x27;s Health and Medical Protection Act. Kind denied the accusation. One of the accusers, a surgeon who requested anonymity, asserted in a sworn statement that a Kind aide explained that he &quot;typically requires a contribution of $10,000 for a one to two-hour personal meeting and $25,000 for a half-day meeting.&quot;

<text>This article lists current [[political parties]] in [[Croatia]], as well as former parties dating back as far as 1841. Since 1989, Croatia has a multi-party system with numerous parties that must collaborate to form coalition governments.

There are a total of 160 active political parties in Croatia as of November 3, 2024. Since January 1990 (when first political parties were officially legalized in Croatia) a total of 409 of them have been registered to date, out of which 249 have since been struck from the register.

The legal position, conditions, method and procedure for the establishment, registration and termination of political parties are determined by the Political Parties Act.

<text>Maxine Moore Waters (née Carr; born August 15, 1938) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 1991. The district, numbered as the 29th district from 1991 to 1993 and as the 35th district from 1993 to 2013, includes much of southern Los Angeles, as well as portions of Gardena, Inglewood and Torrance.

A member of the Democratic Party, Waters is in her 18th House term. She is the most senior of the 13 black women serving in Congress, and chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 1997 to 1999. She is the second-most senior member of the California congressional delegation, after Nancy Pelosi. She chaired the House Financial Services Committee from 2019 to 2023 and has been the ranking member since 2023.

Before becoming a U.S. representative, Waters served seven terms in the California State Assembly, to which she was first elected in 1976. As an assemblywoman, she advocated divestment from South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime. In Congress, she was an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War and has sharply criticized Presidents George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump.

Waters was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;&quot;100 Most Influential People of 2018&quot;.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Waters was born in 1938 in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of Remus Carr and Velma Lee (née Moore). The fifth of 13 children, she was raised by her single mother after her father left the family when Maxine was two. She graduated from Vashon High School in St. Louis before moving with her family to Los Angeles in 1961. She worked in a garment factory and as a telephone operator before being hired as an assistant teacher with the Head Start program in Watts in 1966. Waters later enrolled at Los Angeles State College (now California State University, Los Angeles), where she received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology in 1971.

== Early political career ==
In 1973, Waters went to work as chief deputy to City Councilman David S. Cunningham Jr. She was elected to the California State Assembly in 1976. In the Assembly, she worked for the divestment of state pension funds from any businesses active in South Africa, a country then operating under the policy of apartheid, and helped pass legislation within the guidelines of the divestment campaign&#x27;s Sullivan Principles. She ascended to the position of Democratic Caucus Chair for the Assembly.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===

Upon the retirement of Augustus F. Hawkins in 1990, Waters was elected to the United States House of Representatives for California&#x27;s 29th congressional district with over 79% of the vote. She has been reelected consistently from this district, renumbered as the 35th district in 1992 and as the 43rd in 2012, with at least 70% of the vote.

Waters has represented large parts of south-central Los Angeles and the Los Angeles coastal communities of Westchester and Playa Del Rey, as well as the cities of Torrance, Gardena, Hawthorne, Inglewood and Lawndale.

=== Tenure ===

On July 29, 1994, Waters came to public attention when she repeatedly interrupted a speech by Representative Peter King. The presiding officer, Carrie Meek, classed her behavior as &quot;unruly and turbulent&quot;, and threatened to have the Sergeant at Arms present her with the Mace of the House of Representatives (the equivalent of a formal warning to desist). , this is the most recent instance of the mace being employed for a disciplinary purpose. Waters was eventually suspended from the House for the rest of the day. The conflict with King stemmed from the previous day, when they had both been present at a House Banking Committee hearing on the Whitewater controversy. Waters felt King&#x27;s questioning of Maggie Williams (Hillary Clinton&#x27;s chief of staff) was too harsh, and they subsequently exchanged hostile words.

Waters chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 1997 to 1998. In 2005, she testified at the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearings on &quot;Enforcement of Federal Anti-Fraud Laws in For-Profit Education&quot;, highlighting the American College of Medical Technology as a &quot;problem school&quot; in her district. In 2006, she was involved in the debate over King Drew Medical Center. She criticized media coverage of the hospital and asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deny a waiver of the cross ownership ban, and hence license renewal for KTLA-TV, a station the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; owned. She said, &quot;The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; has had an inordinate effect on public opinion and has used it to harm the local community in specific instances.&quot; She requested that the FCC force the paper to either sell its station or risk losing that station&#x27;s broadcast rights. According to Broadcasting &amp; Cable, the challenges raised &quot;the specter of costly legal battles to defend station holdings... At a minimum, defending against one would cost tens of thousands of dollars in lawyers&#x27; fees and probably delay license renewal about three months&quot;. Waters&#x27;s petition was unsuccessful.

As a Democratic representative in Congress, Waters was a superdelegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She endorsed Democratic U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton for the party&#x27;s nomination in late January 2008, granting Clinton nationally recognized support that some suggested would &quot;make big waves.&quot; Waters later switched her endorsement to U.S. Senator Barack Obama when his lead in the pledged delegate count became insurmountable on the final day of primary voting.

In 2009 Waters had a confrontation with Representative Dave Obey over an earmark in the United States House Committee on Appropriations. The funding request was for a public school employment training center in Los Angeles that was named after her. In 2011, Waters voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, related to a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to detain American citizens and others indefinitely without trial.

Upon Barney Frank&#x27;s retirement in 2012, Waters became the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee. On July 24, 2013, she voted in favor of Amendment 100 in H.R. 2397 Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2014. The amendment targeted domestic surveillance activities, specifically that of the National Security Agency, and would have limited the flexibility of the NSA&#x27;s interpretation of the law to collect sweeping data on U.S. citizens. Amendment 100 was rejected, 217–205.

On March 27, 2014, Waters introduced a discussion draft of the Housing Opportunities Move the Economy Forward Act of 2014 known as the Home Forward Act of 2014. A key provision of the bill includes the collection of 10 basis points for &quot;every dollar outstanding mortgages collateralizing covered securities&quot;, estimated at $5 billion a year. These funds would be directed to three funds that support affordable housing initiatives, with 75% going to the National Housing trust fund. The National Housing Trust Fund will then provide block grants to states to be used primarily to build, preserve, rehabilitate, and operate rental housing that is affordable to the lowest income households, and groups including seniors, disabled persons and low income workers. The National Housing Trust was enacted in 2008, but has yet to be funded. In 2009, Waters co-sponsored Representative John Conyers&#x27;s bill calling for reparations for slavery to be paid to black Americans.

For her tenure as chair of the House Financial Services Committee in the 116th Congress, Waters earned an &quot;A&quot; grade from the nonpartisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

==== CIA ====
After a 1996 &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; article alleged the complicity of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the Los Angeles crack epidemic of the 1980s, Waters called for an investigation. She asked whether &quot;U.S.-government paid or organized operatives smuggled, transported and sold it to American citizens&quot;. The United States Department of Justice announced it had failed to find any evidence to support the original story. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also concluded after its own extensive investigation that the allegations were not supported by evidence. The author of the original story, Gary Webb, was eventually transferred to a different beat and removed from investigative reporting, before his death in 2004. Webb was found in his apartment with two bullet holes in his head. His death was declared a suicide. After these post-publication investigations, Waters read into the Congressional Record a memorandum of understanding in which former President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s CIA director rejected any duty by the CIA to report illegal narcotics trafficking to the Department of Justice.

==== Allegations of corruption ====
According to Chuck Neubauer and Ted Rohrlich writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2004, Waters&#x27;s relatives had made more than $1 million (~$ in ) during the preceding eight years by doing business with companies, candidates and causes that Waters had helped. They claimed she and her husband helped a company get government bond business, and her daughter Karen Waters and son Edward Waters have profited from her connections. Waters replied, &quot;They do their business and I do mine.&quot; Liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Waters to its list of corrupt members of Congress in its 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2011 reports. Citizens Against Government Waste named her the June 2009 Porker of the Month due to her intention to obtain an earmark for the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center.

Waters came under investigation for ethics violations and was accused by a House panel of at least one ethics violation related to her efforts to help OneUnited Bank receive federal aid. Waters&#x27;s husband is a stockholder and former director of OneUnited Bank and the bank&#x27;s executives were major contributors to her campaigns. In September 2008, Waters arranged meetings between U.S. Treasury Department officials and OneUnited Bank so that the bank could plead for federal cash. It had been heavily invested in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and its capital was &quot;all but wiped out&quot; after the U.S. government took it over. The bank received $12 million in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) money. The matter was investigated by the House Ethics Committee, which charged Waters with violations of the House&#x27;s ethics rules in 2010. On September 21, 2012, the House Ethics Committee completed a report clearing Waters of all ethics charges after nearly three years of investigation.

==== Objection to 2000 presidential election results ====
Waters and other House members objected to Florida&#x27;s electoral votes, which George W. Bush narrowly won after a contentious recount. Because no senator joined her objection, the objection was dismissed by Vice President Al Gore, who was Bush&#x27;s opponent in the 2000 presidential election.

==== Objection to 2004 presidential election results ====
Waters was one of 31 House Democrats who voted to not count Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election. President George W. Bush won Ohio by 118,457 votes.

==== Objection to 2016 presidential election results ====
Waters objected to Wyoming&#x27;s electoral votes after the 2016 presidential election, a state Donald Trump won with 68.2% of the vote. Because no senator joined her objection, the objection was dismissed by then-Vice President Joe Biden.

==== &quot;Reclaiming my time&quot; ====
In July 2017, during a House Financial Services Committee meeting, Waters questioned United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. At several points during the questioning, Waters used the phrase &quot;reclaiming my time&quot; when Mnuchin did not directly address the questions Waters had asked him. The video of the interaction between Waters and Mnuchin became popular on social media, and the phrase became attached to her criticisms of Trump.

==== Louis Farrakhan ====

In early 2018, Waters was among the members of Congress the Republican Jewish Coalition called on to resign due to their connections with Nation of Islam leader and known anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan, who had recently drawn criticism for antisemitic remarks. The &quot;Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle&quot; noted that Waters had &quot;long embraced Farrakhan&quot; and refused to denounce him, even as other members of the Congressional Black Caucus who secretly met with Farrakhan in 2005 eventually did.

=== Confrontationalism ===
==== Rodney King verdict and Los Angeles riots ====

When south-central Los Angeles erupted in riotsin which 63 were killedafter the Rodney King verdict in 1992, Waters gained national attention when she led a chant of &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; at a rally amidst the riot. She also &quot;helped deliver relief supplies in Watts and demanded the resumption of vital services&quot;. Waters described the riots as a rebellion, saying, &quot;If you call it a riot it sounds like it was just a bunch of crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason. I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable.&quot; In her view, the violence was &quot;a spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice.&quot; In regard to the looting of Korean-owned stores by local black residents, she said in an interview with KABC radio host Michael Jackson: There were mothers who took this as an opportunity to take some milk, to take some bread, to take some shoes. Maybe they shouldn&#x27;t have done it, but the atmosphere was such that they did it. They are not crooks.

==== Sarah Huckabee Sanders ====

On June 23, 2018, after an incident in which White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was denied service and asked to leave a restaurant, Waters urged attendees at a rally in Los Angeles to harass Trump administration officials, saying:If you see anybody from [Trump&#x27;s] cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them they&#x27;re not welcome anymore, anywhere. Many on the Right saw this statement as an incitement of violence against officials from the Trump administration.

In response, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi posted comments on Twitter reported to be a condemnation of Waters&#x27;s remarks: &quot;Trump&#x27;s daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable.&quot;

==== Derek Chauvin trial ====
Comments by Waters on April 17, 2021, while attending protests over the killing of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, drew controversy. Responding to questions outside the Brooklyn Center police departmenta heavily fortified area that for days had been the site of violent clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators attempting to overrun itWaters commented on the protests and the looming jury verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who at the time was charged with murdering George Floyd. Before closing arguments in the trial, Waters said, &quot;I hope we get a verdict that says guilty, guilty, guilty. And if we don&#x27;t, we cannot go away&quot;, and when asked, &quot;What happens if we do not get what you just told? What should the people do? What should protesters do?&quot;, Waters responded: We&#x27;ve got to stay on the street. And we&#x27;ve got to get more active, we&#x27;ve got to get more confrontational, we&#x27;ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.In response to a question from a reporter about the curfew in effect in Brooklyn Center, which loomed shortly, Waters said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think anything about curfew ... I don&#x27;t know what &#x27;curfew&#x27; means. Curfew means that &#x27;I want to you all to stop talking, I want you to stop meeting, I want you to stop gathering.&#x27; I don&#x27;t agree with that.&quot;

The protests outside the Brooklyn Center police station remained peaceful through the night. The crowd grew raucous when the curfew went into effect but shrank shortly after as protesters left on their own and no arrests were reported.

The judge in Chauvin&#x27;s trial said on April 19, 2021, that Waters&#x27;s comments were &quot;abhorrent&quot; and that it was &quot;disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch&quot; for elected officials to comment in advance of the verdict. The judge refused the defense&#x27;s request for a mistrial, saying that the jury &quot;have been told not to watch the news. I trust they are following those instructions&quot;, but also that &quot;Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned&quot;.

After Waters&#x27;s comments, Republican minority leader Kevin McCarthy said, &quot;Waters is inciting violence in Minneapolis just as she has incited it in the past. If Speaker Pelosi doesn&#x27;t act against this dangerous rhetoric, I will bring action this week&quot;. On April 19, 2021, McCarthy introduced a resolution in the House to censure Waters, calling her comments &quot;dangerous&quot;. The following day, the House voted to block McCarthy&#x27;s resolution, narrowly defeating it along party lines, 216–210.

Waters later said that her remarks in Brooklyn Center were taken out of context and that she believed in nonviolent actions. In an interview, she said, &quot;I talk about confronting the justice system, confronting the policing that&#x27;s going on, I&#x27;m talking about speaking up. I&#x27;m talking about legislation. I&#x27;m talking about elected officials doing what needs to be done to control their budgets and to pass legislation.&quot;

=== Bombing attempt ===
Packages that contained pipe bombs were sent to two of Waters&#x27;s offices on October 24, 2018. They were intercepted and investigated by the FBI. No one was injured. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders and to CNN. In 2019, Cesar Sayoc pleaded guilty to mailing the bombs and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

=== Committee assignments ===

* Committee on Financial Services (Ranking Member)
** As Ranking Member of the committee, Rep. Waters is entitled to sit as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member in any subcommittee meeting, per the committee rules.

=== Caucus memberships ===

* Congressional Progressive Caucus

== Political positions ==

=== Abortion ===
Waters has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and an F rating from the Susan B. Anthony List based on her abortion-related voting record. She opposed the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

=== Barack Obama ===

In August 2011, Waters criticized President Barack Obama, saying he was insufficiently supportive of the black community. She referred to African Americans&#x27; high unemployment rate (around 15.9% at the time). At a Congressional Black Caucus town-hall meeting on jobs in Detroit, Waters said that African American members of Congress were reluctant to criticize or place public pressure on Obama because &quot;y&#x27;all love the President&quot;.

In October 2011, Waters had a public dispute with Obama, arguing that he paid more attention to swing voters in the Iowa caucuses than to equal numbers of (geographically dispersed) black voters. In response, Obama said that it was time to &quot;stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying&quot; and get back to working with him.

=== Crime ===
Waters opposes mandatory minimum sentences.

=== Donald Trump ===

Waters has called Trump &quot;a bully, an egotistical maniac, a liar and someone who did not need to be president&quot; and &quot;the most deplorable person I&#x27;ve ever met in my life&quot;. In a 2017 appearance on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;All In with Chris Hayes&quot;, she said Trump&#x27;s advisors who have ties to Russia or have oil and gas interests there are &quot;a bunch of scumbags&quot;.

Waters began to call for the impeachment of Trump shortly after he took office. In February 2017, she said that Trump was &quot;leading himself&quot; to possible impeachment because of his conflicts of interest and that he was creating &quot;chaos and division&quot;. In September 2017, while giving a eulogy at Dick Gregory&#x27;s funeral, she said that she was &quot;cleaning out the White House&quot; and that &quot;when I get through with Donald Trump, he&#x27;s going to wish he had been impeached.&quot; In October 2017, she said the U.S. Congress had enough evidence against Trump to &quot;be moving on impeachment&quot;, in reference to Russian collusion allegations during the 2016 presidential election, and that Trump &quot;has openly obstructed justice in front of our face&quot;.

Linking Trump to the violence that erupted at a white nationalist protest rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12, 2017, Waters said that the White House &quot;is now the White Supremacists&#x27; House&quot;. After Trump&#x27;s 2018 State of the Union address, she released a video response addressing what most members of the Congressional Black Caucus viewed as his racist viewpoint and actions, saying, &quot;He claims that he&#x27;s bringing people together but make no mistake, he is a dangerous, unprincipled, divisive, and shameful racist.&quot; Trump later replied by calling her a &quot;low-IQ individual&quot;.

On April 24, 2018, while attending the Time 100 Gala, Waters urged Trump to resign from office, &quot;So that I won&#x27;t have to keep up this fight of your having to be impeached because I don&#x27;t think you deserve to be there. Just get out.&quot;

On December 18, 2019, Waters voted for both articles of impeachment against Trump. Moments before voting for the second impeachment of Donald Trump, she called him &quot;the worst president in the history of the United States.″

=== Economy ===

==== Cryptocurrency ====
On June 18, 2019, Waters asked Facebook to halt its plan for the development and launching of Libra, a new cryptocurrency, citing a list of recent scandals. She said: &quot;The cryptocurrency market currently lacks a clear regulatory framework to provide strong protections for investors, consumers and the economy. Regulators should see this as a wake-up call to get serious about the privacy and national security concerns, cybersecurity risks, and trading risks that are posed by cryptocurrencies&quot;.

=== Foreign affairs ===

In August 2008, Waters introduced HR 6796, the Stop Very Unscrupulous Loan Transfers from Underprivileged countries from Rich Exploitive Funds Act (Stop VULTURE Funds Act). It would limit the ability of investors in sovereign debt to use U.S. courts to enforce those instruments against a defaulting country. The bill died in committee.

==== Cuba ====
Waters has visited Cuba a number of times, praising some of Fidel Castro&#x27;s policy proposals. She also criticized previous U.S. efforts to overthrow the Castro regime and demanded an end to the U.S. trade embargo. In 1998, Waters wrote Castro a letter calling the 1960s and 1970s &quot;a sad and shameful chapter of our history&quot; and thanking him for helping those who needed to &quot;flee political persecution&quot;.

In 1998, Waters wrote Castro an open letter asking him not to extradite convicted terrorist Assata Shakur from Cuba, where she had sought asylum. Waters argued that much of the Black community regarded her conviction as false. She had earlier supported a Republican bill to extradite Shakur, who was referred to by her former name, Joanne Chesimard. In 1999, Waters called on President Bill Clinton to return six-year-old Elián González to his father in Cuba; the boy had survived a boat journey from Cuba, during which his mother had drowned, and was taken in by U.S. relatives.

==== Haiti ====
Waters opposed the 2004 coup d&#x27;état in Haiti and criticized U.S. involvement. After the coup, she, TransAfrica Forum founder Randall Robinson, and Jamaican member of parliament Sharon Hay-Webster led a delegation to meet with Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and bring him to Jamaica, where he remained until May.

==== Nagorno-Karabakh conflict ====
On October 1, 2020, Waters co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that condemned Azerbaijan&#x27;s offensive operations against the Armenian-populated enclave Nagorno-Karabakh, denounced Turkey&#x27;s role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and called for an immediate ceasefire.

=== George H. W. Bush ===

In July 1992, Waters called President George H. W. Bush &quot;a racist&quot; who &quot;polarized the races in this country&quot;. Previously, she had suggested that Bush had used race to advance his policies.

=== Tea Party movement ===
Waters has been very critical of the Tea Party movement. On August 20, 2011, at a town hall discussing some of the displeasure that Obama&#x27;s supporters felt about the Congressional Black Caucus not supporting him, Waters said, &quot;This is a tough game. You can&#x27;t be intimidated. You can&#x27;t be frightened. And as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the &#x27;tea party&#x27; can go straight to Hell ... and I intend to help them get there.&quot;

=== War ===

==== Iraq War ====
Waters voted against the Iraq War Resolution, the 2002 resolution that funded and granted Congressional approval to possible military action against the regime of Saddam Hussein. She has remained a consistent critic of the subsequent war and has supported immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq. Waters asserted in 2007 that President George W. Bush was trying to &quot;set [Congress] up&quot; by continually requesting funds for an &quot;occupation&quot; that was &quot;draining&quot; the country of capital, soldier&#x27;s lives, and other resources. In particular, she argued that the economic resources being &quot;wasted&quot; in Iraq were those that might provide universal health care or fully fund Bush&#x27;s &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; education bill. Additionally, Waters, representing a congressional district whose median income falls far below the national average, argued that patriotism alone had not been the sole driving force for those U.S. service personnel serving in Iraq. Rather, &quot;many of them needed jobs, they needed resources, they needed money, so they&#x27;re there&quot;. In a subsequent floor speech, she said that Congress, lacking the votes to override the &quot;inevitable Bush veto on any Iraq-related legislation,&quot; needed to &quot;better [challenge] the administration&#x27;s false rhetoric about the Iraq war&quot; and &quot;educate our constituents [about] the connection between the problems in Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran with the problems we have created in Iraq&quot;. A few months before these speeches, Waters cosponsored the House resolution to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney for making allegedly &quot;false statements&quot; about the war.

== Personal life ==
Waters&#x27;s second husband, Sid Williams, played professional football in the NFL and is a former U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas under the Clinton administration. They live in Los Angeles&#x27;s Windsor Square neighborhood.

In May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Waters confirmed her sister, Velma Moody, had died of the virus, aged 86.

<text>The Croatian Democratic Peasant Party ( or HDSS) is a minor agrarian-conservative political party in Croatia.

The party was led by Ivo Lončar, a popular television news reporter who was elected as a member of the 2000-2003 Parliament from the Croatian Peasant Party list; he subsequently left the party and became an independent deputy. In the November 2003 election he led the party list of HDSS and two other smaller parties and managed to retain his seat in the Parliament. The alliance won 1.0% of the popular vote and 1 out of 151 seats.

Since 2006, the party politics shifted from center-right to center. HDSS supports the development of the agrarian sector, free enterprise, as well as the values of tolerance and dialogue.

<text>Tom Hall (born September 2, 1964) is an American video game designer best known for his work with id Software on titles such as &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and &quot;Commander Keen&quot;. He has also been the co-founder of Ion Storm, together with his friend and colleague John Romero. During his years in the company, Hall designed and produced &quot;Anachronox&quot; and was also actively involved in the development of &quot;Deus Ex&quot;.

==Career==
Hall attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he earned a B.S. in Computer Science. In 1987, Hall worked at Softdisk Inc., where he was both a programmer and the editor of &quot;Softdisk&quot;, a software bundle delivered monthly. Along with some of his co-workers, John Carmack, John Romero and Adrian Carmack, he founded id Software, having always dreamt about the possibility of making videogames for a living. During the subsequent years, he served as creative director and designer there, working on games such as &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot; and the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series, of which he was the lead designer, then &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, and &quot;Doom&quot;.

After some disputes with John Carmack and John Romero over the direction to take with &quot;Doom&quot;, Tom left id Software in August 1993 to join Apogee, a company that had become well renowned in the market for its highly successful shareware distribution philosophy, and came to be known as 3D Realms in later years. Tom was the game designer for &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;, produced &quot;Terminal Velocity&quot;, and helped in varying degrees on &quot;Duke Nukem II&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; as well. He also worked on the &quot;Prey&quot; engine until August 12, 1996, when he left Apogee.

In November 1996, Hall co-founded Ion Storm with former id Software colleague John Romero. During the years at Ion Storm he produced the critically acclaimed &quot;Anachronox&quot;, a sci-fi themed adventure game with prominent role-playing elements. The company also produced the 2000 Game of the Year, &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, in which Hall voiced several characters. He and Romero then founded Monkeystone Games, a company with the goal of producing mobile games in the new mobile industry. He designed &quot;Hyperspace Delivery Boy!&quot;, which was released on December 23, 2001, with programming by John Romero.

He and Romero joined Midway Games in 2003, and Monkeystone closed in January 2005. Hall also left Midway early that year and did independent game consultation work out of Austin, Texas, until in February he joined a startup company called KingsIsle Entertainment based in the same area.

Hall left KingsIsle Entertainment and joined Loot Drop on January 1, 2011. Along with Loot Drop, he unsuccessfully tried to crowdfund a game called &quot;Shaker&quot; on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter in October 2012.

<doc id="409026" wikidata="Q1912438" url="?curid=409026" title="Erast Fandorin">
<text>Erast Petrovich Fandorin () is a fictional 19th-century Russian detective and the hero of a series of Russian historical detective novels by Boris Akunin.

The first Fandorin novel (&quot;The Winter Queen&quot;, Russian: &quot;Азазель&quot;) was published in Russia in 1998, and the latest and the last one in 2023 (&quot;The Pit&quot;, Russian: &quot;Яма&quot;). More than 15 million copies of Fandorin novels have been sold as of May 2006, even though the novels were freely available from many Russian websites and the hard copies were relatively expensive by Russian standards. New books in the Fandorin series typically sell over 200,000 copies in the first week alone, with an unparalleled (for mystery novels) first edition of 50,000 copies for the first books to 500,000 copies for the last.

The English translations of the novels have been critically acclaimed by, among others, Ruth Rendell.

==Background==
In the Soviet Union, detective novels enjoyed mass popularity. Although they were seen as a &quot;low genre&quot; by the communist officials, both local (such as Igor (Georgy) Vayner and Julian Semenov), and foreign detective novels have always been avidly coveted.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many trashy detective novels were published that featured a lot of gore and sex. Akunin&#x27;s wife, in common with many other Russians, started to enjoy reading this genre of literature. However, she did not want to be seen reading the novels and she always wrapped them in brown paper to prevent people from seeing what she was reading. This inspired Akunin to create a detective novel which nobody would be ashamed to be caught reading, something between the literature of Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky and the pulp of modern Russian detective novels.

He set out to write a cycle about Fandorin with an exploration of every subgenre of the detective novel in mind, from spies to serial killers. In addition, he wanted to address different types of human character in his books. As Akunin identified sixteen subgenres of crime novels, as well as sixteen character types, the novels in the Erast Fandorin series ultimately numbered sixteen, with the final novel, &quot;Not Saying Goodbye&quot;, published in 2018. The series is titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;New detective&quot;, or &quot;New Mystery&quot;). This title serves to set the novels apart from the postmodernist intellectual novels as well as from the trashy detective novels, but it is also a subtle play on the use of time in the novels.

Akunin uses many historical settings for his novels. He uses the war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire as background for the novel &quot;The Turkish Gambit&quot;; the death of the &quot;White General&quot; Mikhail Skobelev (as &#x27;Mikhail Sobolev&#x27;) in &quot;The Death of Achilles&quot;; and the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II and the Khodynka Tragedy for &quot;Coronation, or the Last of the Romanovs&quot;. Akunin uses the gaps in the knowledge of these histories to create an atmosphere for his mystery novels to which readers can relate.

<doc id="409027" wikidata="Q29271" url="?curid=409027" title="Pongal (festival)">
<text>Pongal (IPA: ) is a multi-day Hindu harvest festival celebrated by Tamils. The festival is celebrated over three or four days with Bhogi, Thai Pongal, Mattu Pongal and Kaanum Pongal, beginning on the last day of the Tamil calendar month of Margazhi, and observed on consecutive days. Thai Pongal is observed on the first day of the Tamil calendar month of Thai and usually falls on 14 or 15 January in the Gregorian calendar. It is dedicated to the solar deity Surya and corresponds to Makar Sankranti, the Hindu observance celebrated under various regional names across the Indian subcontinent. 

According to tradition, the festival marks the end of winter solstice, and the start of the Sun&#x27;s six-month-long journey northwards called Uttarayana when the Sun enters Capricorn. The festival is named after the ceremonial &quot;Pongal&quot;, which means &quot;boiling over&quot; or &quot;overflow&quot; in Tamil language and refers to the traditional dish prepared by boiling rice with milk and jaggery. Mattu Pongal is meant for celebration of cattle, and the cattle are bathed, their horns polished and painted in bright colors with garlands of flowers placed around their necks and processions on the day. The festival is traditionally an occasion for decorating with rice-powder based kolam artworks, offering prayers at home, visiting temples, getting together with family and friends, and exchanging gifts to renew social bonds of solidarity.

Pongal is also referred to as &quot;Tamizhar thirunal&quot; (&quot;the festival of Tamil people&quot;) and is one of the major festivals celebrated by the Tamil people across various religions. It is observed by the Tamil diaspora in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, parts of South India, Sri Lanka and other parts of the world with significant Tamil population.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Thai Pongal&quot; is a combination of two Tamil language words: &quot;Thai&quot; (Tamil: &#x27;தை&#x27;) referring to the tenth month of the Tamil calendar and &quot;Pongal&quot; (from &quot;pongu&quot;) meaning &quot;boiling over&quot; or &quot;overflow.&quot; Pongal also refers to a sweet dish of rice boiled with milk and jaggery that is ritually prepared and consumed on the day. It is also referred to as &quot;Tamizhar thirunal&quot; (&quot;the festival of Tamil people&quot;).

== History ==
The principal theme of Pongal is thanking the Sun god Surya, the forces of nature, and the farm animals and people who support agriculture. The festival is mentioned in an inscription found at the Veeraraghava Swamy Temple. Attributed to the Chola king Kulottunga I (1070–1122 CE), the inscription describes a grant of land to the temple for celebrating the annual Pongal festivities. The ninth century Shaiva Bhakti text &quot;Tiruvempavai&quot; by Manikkavacakar details the festival. It appears in Tamil texts and inscriptions with variant spellings such as &quot;ponakam&quot;, &quot;tiruponakam,&quot; and &quot;ponkal&quot;. Temple inscriptions from the Chola and Vijayanagara periods detail recipes similar to pongal recipes of the modern era with variations in seasonings and relative amounts of the ingredients. The terms &quot;ponakam&quot;, &quot;ponkal&quot; and its prefixed variants might also indicate the festive pongal dish as a prasadam (religious offering) which were given as a part of the meals served by free community kitchens in South Indian Hindu temples either as festival food or to pilgrims every day.

== Observance ==
Pongal is a multi-day Hindu harvest festival celebrated by Tamils. The three days of the Pongal festival are called Bhogi, Thai Pongal, and Mattu Pongal. Some Tamils celebrate a fourth day of Pongal known as Kanum Pongal. While the festival is observed for three or four days in Tamil Nadu, but for one or two days in urban locations and by the Tamil diaspora outside South Asia.

=== Bhogi ===
Bhogi marks the first day of the Pongal festivities and is celebrated on the last day of the Tamil calendar month Marghazhi. On this day people discard old belongings and celebrate new possessions. The people assemble and light a bonfire in order to burn the heaps of discards. Houses are cleaned, painted and decorated to give a festive look. Prayers are offered to Indra, the king of Gods with thanks and hopes for plentiful rains in the year ahead. Kaappu kattu is a tradition of tying leaves of Azadirachta indica, Senna auriculata and Aerva lanata in the roofs of houses and residential areas that is widely practiced in the Kongu Nadu region. Bhogi is observed on the same day in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Fruits of the harvest are collected along with flowers of the season and a mixture of treats along with money is given to children, who then separate and collect the money and sweet fruits.

=== Thai Pongal ===
Thai Pongal is the main festive day, celebrated on the next day of Bhogi. It is observed on the first day of the Tamil calendar month of Thai, and usually falls on 14 or 15 January as per the Gregorian calendar. It is dedicated to the Sun deity Surya and corresponds to Makar Sankranti, the harvest festival under various regional names celebrated throughout India. According to tradition, the festival marks the end of winter solstice, and the start of the sun&#x27;s six-month-long journey northwards when the sun enters the Capricorn, also called as Uttarayana.

Dedicated to Surya, it is celebrated with family and friends with new clothes worn and the preparation of the traditional pongal dish in an earthen pot. The pot is typically decorated by tying a turmeric plant or flower garland and placed in the sun along with sugarcane stalks. The homes are decorated with banana and mango leaves, decorative florals and kolams. Relatives and friends are invited and when the pongal starts to boil and overflow out of the vessel, participants blow a conch or make sounds while shouting &quot;Pongalo Pongal&quot; (&quot;may this rice boil over&quot;). In rural areas, people sing traditional songs while the pongal dish is cooking. The Pongal dish is first offered to Surya and Ganesha, and then shared with the gathered friends and family. People traditionally offer prayers to the sun in the open and then proceed to eat their meal. A community Pongal is an event where families gather at a public place for a ceremonial worship.

=== Mattu Pongal ===

Mattu Pongal (&quot;Madu&quot; meaning cow in Tamil) is the third day of the festival meant for the celebration of cattle. The cattle is regarded as sources of wealth as it is a means for dairy products and fertilizers, used for transportation and agriculture. The cattle are bathed, their horns are polished and painted in bright colors with garlands of flowers placed around their necks and taken for processions. Some decorate their cows with turmeric water and apply shikakai and kumkuma to their foreheads. The cattle are fed sweets including pongal, jaggery, honey, banana and other fruits. People may prostrate before them with words of thanks for the help with the harvest.

=== Kanum Pongal ===

Kanum Pongal or Kanu Pongal is the fourth day of the festival and marks the end of Pongal festivities for the year. The word &quot;kanum&quot; in the context means &quot;to visit&quot; and families hold reunions on this day. Communities organize social events to strengthen mutual bonds and consume food and sugarcane during social gatherings. Young people visit elders to pay respects and seek blessings, with elders giving gifts to the visiting children.

== Traditions and practices ==
Pongal is traditionally an occasion for decorating, offering prayers in the home, temples, getting together with family and friends, and exchanging gifts to renew social bonds of solidarity. It is viewed more as a &quot;social festival&quot; since the contemporary celebrations do not necessarily link it to temple rituals. Temples and cultural centers organize the ritual cooking of Pongal dish, along with fairs (&quot;Pongal mela&quot;) with handicrafts, crafts, pottery, sarees, ethnic jewelry for sale. These sites hold traditional community sports such as &quot;Uri Adithal&quot; (&quot;breaking a hanging mud pot while blindfolded&quot;), &quot;Pallanguzhi&quot; and &quot;Kabbadi&quot;, as well as group dance and music performances in major cities and towns.

The festival is marked with colorful kolam artwork. Kolam is a form of traditional decorative art that is drawn by using rice flour often along with natural or synthetic color powders. It includes geometrical line drawings composed of straight lines, curves and loops, drawn around a grid pattern of dots. 

=== Cuisine ===

The festival is named after the &quot;Pongal&quot; dish, which forms the festival&#x27;s most significant practice. The dish is prepared by boiling freshly harvested rice in cow milk and raw cane sugar. Additional ingredients such as coconut and ghee along with spices such as cardamom, raisins and cashews are also used. The cooking is done in a clay pot that is often garlanded with leaves or flowers, sometimes tied with a piece of turmeric root. It is either cooked at home, or in community gatherings such as in temples or village open spaces. The cooking is done in sunlight, usually in a porch or courtyard and the dish is dedicated to the Sun god, Surya. After it is traditionally offered to the gods and goddesses first, followed sometimes by cows, then to friends and family gathered. Temples and communities organize free kitchen prepared by volunteers to all those who gather. Portions of the sweet pongal dish (&quot;Sakkarai Pongal&quot;) are distributed as the &quot;prasadam&quot; in temples.

The dish and the process of its preparation is a part of the symbolism, both conceptually and materially. It celebrates the harvest and the cooking symbolizes the transformation of the gift of agriculture into nourishment for the gods and the community on a day that when the sun god is believed to start the journey north. The dish &quot;boiling over&quot; is believed to symbolically mark the blessing by Parvati. It is the ritual dish, along with many other courses prepared from seasonal foods for the gathering.

=== Jallikattu ===
The day marks a ritual visit to nearby temples where communities hold processions by parading icons from the sanctum of the temple in wooden chariots, drama-dance performances encouraging social gatherings and renewal of community bonds. Other events during Pongal include community sports and games such as Jallikattu or bull fighting. Jallikattu is a traditional event held during the period attracting huge crowds in which a bull is released into a crowd of people, and multiple human participants attempt to grab the large hump on the bull&#x27;s back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape. Kanu Pidi is a tradition observed on Mattu Pongal by women and young girls where they place a leaf of turmeric plant outside their home, and feed pongal dish and food to the birds, particularly crow and pray for their brothers&#x27; well being. Brothers pay special tribute to their married sisters by giving gifts as affirmation of their filial love.

== Contemporary practices ==
Pongala is celebrated in Kerala, a state that shares historic cultural overlap with Tamils through Chera dynasty according to Sangam literature. The rituals including the cooking of pongal dish, social visits, and the reverence for cattle is observed by some communities and is observed on the same day as Tamil Pongal. The celebrations include dance (Kathakali) and musical performances by boys and girls, as well as major processions featuring the temple goddess. In the Attukal Bhagavati Temple near Thiruvanathapuram, Attukal Pongala is celebrated in the month of February–March which attract large crowds.

In Karnataka, the festival days are similar, except the dish is called &quot;Ellu&quot;. Decorations and social visits are also common in many parts of Karnataka. The festivities coincide with Makara Sankranthi, Maghi and Bihu celebrated across various parts of India.

In Sri Lanka, Pongal is celebrated by the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Pongal festivities last two days, essentially focused on Thai Pongal day. The custom of cooking Pukkai, a dish similar to Pongal, and made of rice and milk, is carried out on the first day.

Pongal is one of the major festivals celebrated by Tamil people across various religions in Tamil Nadu. It is also celebrated in other parts of South India, and is a major Tamil festival in Sri Lanka. It is observed by the Tamil diaspora worldwide, including those in Malaysia, Mauritius, South Africa, Singapore, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the Gulf countries. In 2017, Delegate David Bulova introduced a joint resolution HJ573 in the Virginia House of Delegates to designate January 14 of each year as Pongal Day.

<text>Juanita Millender-McDonald (September 7, 1938 – April 22, 2007) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1996 until her death in 2007, representing California&#x27;s 37th congressional district, which includes most of South Central Los Angeles and the city of Long Beach, California. She was a member of the Democratic Party.

On December 19, 2006, Millender-McDonald was named Chairwoman of the House Committee on House Administration for the 110th Congress. She was the first African-American woman to chair the committee. She was also a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and of the New Democrat Coalition and was considered a front-runner for the job of Secretary of Transportation if John Kerry had been elected President in 2004.

==Biography==
Millender-McDonald was born in Birmingham, Alabama. She was educated at Los Angeles Harbor College; at the University of Redlands, from which she received a business degree; and at California State University, Los Angeles, from which she earned a masters in educational administration; and the University of Southern California, from which she completed her doctorate in public administration.

She worked as a teacher, a textbook editor, and later as director of a nonprofit organization working for gender issues. She was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Millender-McDonald served as a member of the City Council of Carson, California and was a member of the California State Assembly (after beating two sitting incumbent Democrats that had been reapportioned into the same Carson based assembly district in 1992) before entering the House.

She was first elected to the House in a March 1996 special election to replace Congressman Walter Tucker, who resigned due to corruption charges and was later sentenced to 27 months in prison. While she won a difficult nine-candidate primary in her first election run (fellow assembly member Willard Murray came in a close second) she did not face any serious opposition in any of her reelection campaigns.

In Congress, she was known for her commitment to protecting international human rights. Millender-McDonald worked to aid victims of genocide and human trafficking. In 1996, she also led an inquiry into allegations that the CIA was working with cocaine traffickers to fund Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

Within a week of her requesting a leave of absence to deal with her illness, on April 22, 2007, Millender-McDonald died in hospice care, succumbing to colon cancer at the age of 68 at her home in Carson. She left a husband, James McDonald, Jr., and five adult children.

==Successor==

Congresswoman Millender-McDonald&#x27;s seat was vacant until Laura Richardson won the August 21, 2007, special election. Under California law, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced a special election date of June 26, and because no candidate received more than 50% of the total vote, the candidates with the most votes in their respective parties participated in an August 21 runoff. In the June Primary, State Senator Jenny Oropeza lost to State Assemblywoman Laura Richardson, with Richardson continuing to the August special election, when she defeated Republican John M. Kanaley, Libertarian Herb Peters, and Green Daniel Brezenoff.

==Education and early life==
Pillinger was born on 9 May 1943 in Kingswood, South Gloucestershire, just outside Bristol. His father, Alfred, a manual worker for the Gas Board, and his mother, Florence (née Honour), also had a daughter Doreen (the local historian D.P. Lindegaard), 6 years Colin&#x27;s senior, born 1937. He attended Kingswood Grammar School, and later graduated with a BSc and a PhD in chemistry from University College of Swansea (now Swansea University). He said of himself, &quot;I was a disaster as a science student&quot;.

==Career and research==
After graduating from university, Pillinger became a senior research associate in the Department of Earth Science at the University of Cambridge, and then a senior research fellow at The Open University (1984–90). He became a professor in interplanetary science at The Open University in 1991.

Pillinger&#x27;s first job was working for NASA. He was involved in the Apollo space programme and ESA&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission, and analysed the lunar samples brought back by Apollo 11.

Between 1996 and 2000, Pillinger was made Gresham Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, a position once held by Sir Christopher Wren. He said of his appointment as professor of astronomy:
Pillinger is credited with inspiring many people to take an interest in space science, particularly in Britain. He was responsible for training and supporting a large number of experts in the field as well as helping to unite the space science and industrial communities in the UK. Pillinger worked as a conference and after-dinner speaker for the JLA agency.

To demonstrate his appetite for sharing his research and promoting the public understanding of science, Pillinger laid claim to the phrase &quot;The only thing that increases in value if you share it is knowledge&quot;.

In 2000, a main belt asteroid was named 15614 Pillinger after Colin Pillinger. In 2003, he was appointed a CBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List for his services to higher education and to science. Pillinger played a role in the &quot;Philae&quot; lander that was part of the &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission which successfully made its rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in 2014. In particular he was an advocate of the idea of deploying the lander &quot;Philae&quot; to conduct scientific experiments in situ, and was instrumental in getting the Ptolemy device accepted as part of the science payload.

===&quot;Beagle 2&quot;===

Pillinger was the principal investigator for &quot;Beagle 2&quot; Mars lander project, part of European Space Agency&#x27;s (ESA) 2003 &quot;Mars Express&quot; mission. Initially considered a failure, it has since come to light that the space craft did successfully touch down on the surface of Mars. The UK Space Agency on 16 January 2015 indicated that &quot;Beagle 2&quot; had indeed reached the surface of Mars on 25 December 2003, but had failed to deploy fully. Images taken by the HiRISE camera on NASA&#x27;s &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; (MRO) identified clear evidence for the lander and convincing evidence for key entry and descent components on the surface of Mars within the expected landing area of Isidis Planitia (an impact basin close to the equator).

Recent research into photographs taken of the landing site by a Mars orbiter suggest that as many as three of the four solar panels may have been successfully opened. As the transmitter was underneath the fourth panel, the lander failed to communicate back to Earth.

When the lander was first considered &#x27;lost&#x27; a number of possible explanations were given by David Southwood, ESA&#x27;s director of Science. The commission inquiring into the mission&#x27;s apparent failure also apportioned blame towards Pillinger&#x27;s management of the overall project as a contributing factor. In response, in his autobiography, Professor Pillinger highlighted a lack of support from key figures at ESA as a factor.

It was Pillinger&#x27;s wife who thought of the &quot;Beagle 2&quot; name for the project, based on Charles Darwin&#x27;s ship .

Pillinger enlisted British rock band Blur to write a song to be &quot;Beagle 2&quot;″s call sign back home. It was to be broadcast as soon as &quot;Beagle 2&quot; began work on the surface of Mars. He also persuaded the artist Damien Hirst to provide a spot painting to use in calibrating the spacecraft&#x27;s camera.

In 2014, a science destination for the Mars rover &quot;Opportunity&quot; on the western rim of Endeavour Crater was named &quot;Pillinger Point&quot; after Colin Pillinger, in commemoration of his enthusiasm for the &quot;Beagle 2&quot; mission.

===Pillinger in popular culture===
&quot;Beagle 2&quot; has been mentioned in Hollywood films &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; (and in the prequel Transformers: Beginnings comic) and Pillinger&#x27;s work on asteroid impacts in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. A missing British Mars spacecraft was the subject of the 2005 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas Special. Pillinger appeared in &quot;Top Gear&quot; season 3 episode 7 and won a contest based on the best burnout. &quot;Beagle 2&quot; featured in a science fiction story by Stephen Baxter and as one of the subjects in &quot;The Backroom Boys&quot; by Frances Spufford.
Colin Pillinger was one of the guests talking about the planet Mars for In Our Time, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 11 January 2007.

==Personal life==
Pillinger&#x27;s widow, Judith, is also a scientist. They met when working in the same laboratory and had two children, a son, Nicolas Joseph, and a daughter, Shusanah Jane, who in 2015 became the first solo British woman to complete the Race Across America ultra-endurance cycle race.

After experiencing difficulty with walking for two years, Pillinger was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis in May 2005. He owned a dairy farm, but towards the end of his life his illness prevented him from doing physical work on the farm. Pillinger died two days before his 71st birthday at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge on 7 May 2014, after having a brain haemorrhage and falling into a coma.

<text>Tammy Suzanne Green Baldwin (born February 11, 1962) is an American politician and lawyer serving since 2013 as the junior United States senator from Wisconsin. A member of the Democratic Party, she has also served as the Secretary of the Senate Democratic Caucus since 2017 and is the dean of the United States congressional delegation from Wisconsin.

Baldwin graduated from Smith College and the University of Wisconsin Law School, and was a lawyer in private practice before entering the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1993. She served three terms from Wisconsin&#x27;s 78th Assembly district from 1993 to 1999, and seven terms as the United States congresswoman from Wisconsin&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1999 to 2013. She was elected to the United States Senate in 2012, and reelected in 2018 and 2024.

Baldwin is the first openly lesbian woman elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly (1993), the first openly lesbian woman and first woman elected to the U.S. House from Wisconsin (1998), and the first openly LGBT person and first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Wisconsin (2012). She has a progressive voting record on healthcare, reproductive rights, and LGBT rights.

==Early life and education==
Baldwin was born and grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. Her mother, who died in 2017, was 19 and going through a divorce when Baldwin was born. Baldwin was raised by her grandparents and spent Saturdays with her mother, who suffered from mental illness and opioid addiction. Her maternal grandfather, biochemist David E. Green, was Jewish (the son of immigrants from Russia and Germany), and her maternal grandmother, who was Anglican, was English-born. Baldwin&#x27;s aunt is biochemist Rowena Green Matthews. Through her maternal grandfather, Baldwin is a third cousin of comedian Andy Samberg.

Baldwin graduated from Madison West High School in 1980 as the class valedictorian. She earned a B.A. from Smith College in 1984 and a J.D. from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1989. She was a lawyer in private practice from 1989 to 1992.

==Wisconsin Assembly (1993–1999)==
===Elections===
Before entering state politics, Baldwin first held political office in 1986 at age 24, when she was elected to the Dane County Board of Supervisors, on which she served until 1994. She also served one year on the Madison Common Council to fill a vacancy in the coterminous district.

Baldwin ran to represent Wisconsin&#x27;s 78th Assembly district in central Madison in 1992. She won the Democratic primary with 43% of the vote. In the general election, Baldwin defeated Labor and Farm Party nominee Mary Kay Baum and Republican nominee Patricia Hevenor, 59–23–17%. She was one of just six openly gay political candidates nationwide to win a general election that year.

Baldwin was reelected with 76% of the vote in 1994. She was reelected to a third term with 71% of the vote in 1996.

Committee assignments
*Criminal Justice Committee
*Education Committee (Chair)
*Elections, Constitutional Law and Corrections Committee

==U.S. House of Representatives (1999–2013)==
===Elections===
In 1998, U.S. Congressman Scott Klug of the 2nd district, based in Madison, announced he would retire, prompting Baldwin to run for the seat. Baldwin&#x27;s ads leaned into the fact that Wisconsin had never sent a woman to Congress, and many of her ads targeted younger voters. She won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 37% of the vote. In the general election, she defeated Republican nominee Josephine Musser, 53–47%. Baldwin&#x27;s campaign drew strong turnout in Dane County, using a team of volunteers, many of whom were students. The turnout was said to have helped Russ Feingold&#x27;s reelection campaign that year, and was acknowledged by Feingold as a factor.

Baldwin was the first woman elected to Congress from Wisconsin. She was also the first openly gay non-incumbent elected to the House of Representatives, and the first open lesbian elected to Congress. She and Representative Barney Frank co-founded the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus in 2008.

In 2000, Baldwin was reelected, defeating Republican nominee John Sharpless 51–49%, a difference of 8,902 votes. She lost eight of the district&#x27;s nine counties, but carried the largest, Dane County, with 55% of the vote.

After the 2000 census the 2nd district was made significantly more Democratic in redistricting. Baldwin won reelection to a third term in the newly redrawn 2nd district with 66% of the vote against Republican Ron Greer. In 2004, she beat Dave Magnum 63–37%. She won a 2006 rematch against Magnum, again winning 63–37%. In 2008, she defeated Peter Theron 69–31%, and in 2010 she won a seventh term with 62% of the vote against Chad Lee.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Energy and Commerce
**Subcommittee on Environment and Economy
**Subcommittee on Health

==U.S. Senate (2013–present)==

===Elections===

==== 2012 ====

Baldwin ran as the Democratic nominee against Republican nominee Tommy Thompson, who had formerly been governor and Secretary of Health and Human Services. She announced her candidacy on September 6, 2011, in a video emailed to supporters. She ran uncontested in the primary election, and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention about tax policy, campaign finance reform, and equality in the United States.

She was endorsed by Democracy for America, and she received campaign funding from EMILY&#x27;s List, the Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund, and LPAC. Baldwin was endorsed by the editorial board of &quot;The Capital Times&quot;, who wrote that &quot;Baldwin&#x27;s fresh ideas on issues ranging from job creation to health care reform, along with her proven record of working across lines of partisanship and ideology, and her grace under pressure mark her as precisely the right choice to replace retiring U.S. Senator Herb Kohl&quot;.Thompson said during the campaign that Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;far-left approach leaves this country in jeopardy&quot;. The candidates had three debates, on September 28, October 18, and October 26. According to Baldwin&#x27;s Federal Election Commission filings, she raised about $12 million, over $5 million more than Thompson.

On November 6, 2012, Baldwin became the first openly gay candidate to be elected to the U.S. Senate, with 51.4% of the vote. Because of her 14 years in the House of Representatives, under Senate rules she had the highest seniority in her entering class of senators. She was succeeded in Congress by State Representative Mark Pocan, who had earlier succeeded her in the state legislature.

Baldwin was featured in &quot;Time&#x27;s&quot; November 19, 2012, edition, in the Verbatim section, where she was quoted as saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t run to make history&quot; on her historic election. In a separate section, she was also mentioned as a new face to watch in the Senate.

==== 2018 ====
Baldwin won a second term in 2018 with 55.4% of the vote, defeating Republican Leah Vukmir by a margin of approximately 11%.

==== 2024 ====
In April 2023, Baldwin announced her intention to run for a third Senate term. She narrowly defeated Republican nominee Eric Hovde even as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump won Wisconsin.

===119th United States Congress Committee assignments===

*Committee on Appropriations
*Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
*Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions

==Political positions==

In 2003, Baldwin served on the advisory committee of the Progressive Majority, a political action committee dedicated to electing progressive candidates to public office.

In 2012, Baldwin described herself as a progressive in the mold of former Wisconsin governor and U.S. senator Robert M. La Follette. In 2013, she and Wisconsin&#x27;s senior U.S. Senator, Ron Johnson, split on votes more frequently than any other Senate duo from the same state. She was one of 16 female Democratic senators to sign a letter in 2013 endorsing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election.

In 2023, the Lugar Center ranked Baldwin in the top third of senators for bipartisanship.

=== Agriculture ===
In 2019, she and eight other Democratic senators sent United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue a letter that criticized the USDA for purchasing pork from JBS USA, an American subsidiary of a Brazilian corporation.

===Bush administration===
Baldwin cosponsored H. Res. 333, a bill in 2007 proposing articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney, and H. Res. 589, a bill proposing the impeachment of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. She wrote in the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot;, &quot;I joined with my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee, Reps. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.) and Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), in urging Chairman Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) to conduct hearings on a resolution of impeachment now pending consideration in that committee.&quot; She added that although some constituents &quot;say I have gone too far&quot;, others &quot;argue I have not gone far enough&quot; and feel &quot;we are losing our democracy and that I should do more to hold the Bush administration accountable for its actions.&quot;

=== Climate change ===
In 2018, Baldwin was one of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution in response to findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment.

=== Crime ===
In 1995, Baldwin proposed the creation of a review board to investigate the deaths of prison inmates. In 1997, she authored a bill changing Wisconsin&#x27;s candidate filing system to an electronic one. Baldwin opposes capital punishment in Wisconsin.

=== Drug policy ===

Baldwin was one of 17 senators to sign a letter to President-elect Donald Trump in 2016 asking him to fulfill a campaign pledge to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.

She and 30 other senators signed a letter to Kaléo Pharmaceuticals in 2017 in response to the opioid-overdose-reversing device Evzio rising in price from $690 in 2014 to $4,500 and requested the company detail the price structure for Evzio, how many devices Kaléo Pharmaceuticals set aside for donation, and the totality of federal reimbursements Evzio received in the previous year.

Baldwin was one of six senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in 2017 requesting their &quot;help in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the 340B program&quot;, a Trump administration rule mandating that drug companies give discounts to health-care organizations presently serving large numbers of low-income patients.

===Economic policy===

In a 2015 radio interview, Baldwin said that she, the Pope, and Donald Trump all supported repeal of the carried interest tax loophole. PolitiFact wrote that &quot;while Pope Francis has called for helping the poor and addressing economic inequality, we could not find that [Trump] has spoken out on this particular tax break.&quot; In 2016, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business-oriented lobbying group that usually supports Republican candidates, gave her a 32% cumulative score on &quot;key business votes&quot;.

The editors of &quot;The Capital Times&quot; commended Baldwin for her vocal opposition to a budget resolution in 2017 that she believed would increase income inequality, calling her &quot;one of the budget&#x27;s most ardent foes&quot;. She expressed opposition to the Trump tax-reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that it was being drafted &quot;behind closed doors&quot; and charging that it was being &quot;shoved through.&quot; In its place she promoted the Stronger Way Act, a bill that she and Cory Booker co-sponsored.

Baldwin sponsored the Reward Work Act of 2018, which proposed to guarantee the right of employees in listed companies to elect one-third of the board of directors. She signed a letter to United States Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta in 2019 that advocated that the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) make a full investigation into a complaint filed in May by a group of Chicago-area McDonald&#x27;s employees that detailed instances of workplace violence, such as customers throwing hot coffee and threatening employees with firearms. The senators argued that McDonald&#x27;s could and should &quot;do more to protect its employees, but employers will not take seriously their obligations to provide a safe workplace if OSHA does not enforce workers rights to a hazard-free workplace.&quot;

Baldwin supports Buy America rules and has advocated for their inclusion in federal funding bills.

==== Trade ====

Baldwin was one of 12 senators to sign a letter to President Obama in 2016 asserting that the passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership &quot;in its current form will perpetuate a trade policy that advantages corporations at the expense of American workers&quot; and that there would be an &quot;erosion of U.S. manufacturing and middle class jobs, and accelerate the corporate race to the bottom&quot; if provisions were not fixed.

In 2024, Baldwin was one of a handful of Democrats credited with ending President Biden&#x27;s proposed Indo-Pacific trade agenda. She said, &quot;There were some big concerns that we would be retreating back to the day where trade was a race to the bottom, especially for workers.&quot;

==== Antitrust, competition, and corporate regulation ====
Baldwin was one of six Democrats led by Amy Klobuchar to sign letters in 2019 to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice recounting that many of them had &quot;called on both the FTC and the Justice Department to investigate potential anticompetitive activity in these markets, particularly following the significant enforcement actions taken by foreign competition enforcers against these same companies&quot; and requesting that each agency confirm whether it had opened antitrust investigations into each company and that each agency pledge it would publicly release any such investigations&#x27; findings.

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Central America ====
Baldwin was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to President Trump in 2019 encouraging him &quot;to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America&quot;, asserting that Trump had &quot;consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance&quot; since becoming president and that he was &quot;personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity&quot; by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.

==== Israel ====
In 2020, Baldwin voiced her opposition to Israel&#x27;s plan to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In March 2024, she urged the Biden administration to recognize a &quot;nonmilitarized&quot; Palestinian state after the end of the war in Gaza. In April, she voted for a $14 billion dollar military aid package to Israel. Baldwin attended Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s address to Congress in July 2024 and was the only Democratic representative from Wisconsin in attendance. After the address, she said she was &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; in the remarks, which came in the middle of the conflict in Gaza. Baldwin wrote that while she was &quot;resolute&quot; in her support for &quot;Israel&#x27;s right to defend itself and the need to end Hamas&#x27;s threat... the time has come for the innocent bloodshed and the war to end&quot;. Baldwin supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestine conflict.

==== Russia ====
Baldwin was one of 11 senators to sign a letter in 2017 to United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressing their concern &quot;about credible allegations that the Trump campaign, transition team, and Administration has colluded with the Russian government, including most recently the events leading to the resignation of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser.&quot; The senators requested the creation of &quot;an independent Special Counsel to investigate collusion with the Russian government by General Flynn and other Trump campaign, transition and Administrative officials&quot; in order to maintain &quot;the confidence, credibility and impartiality of the Department of Justice&quot;.

After United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in 2016 that the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Baldwin was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration &quot;now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America&#x27;s nuclear-armed adversaries&quot; and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.

====Opposition to Iraq War====

Baldwin was a vocal critic of the Iraq War. She was among the 133 members of the House who voted in 2002 against authorizing the invasion of Iraq. She said there would be &quot;postwar challenges&quot;, that &quot;there is no history of democratic government in Iraq&quot;, that its &quot;economy and infrastructure are in ruins after years of war and sanctions&quot;, and that rebuilding would take &quot;a great deal of money&quot;. In 2005, she joined the Out of Iraq Caucus. In 2023, Baldwin voted with a bipartisan majority to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) in Iraq. She also supports repealing the 2001 AUMF for the War on Terror.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
Baldwin voted for a resolution by Rand Paul and Chris Murphy in 2017 that would block Trump&#x27;s $510 million sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia that made up a portion of the $110 billion arms sale Trump announced during his visit to Saudi Arabia the previous year.

Baldwin voted against tabling a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee in 2018 that would have required Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda. In 2021, she voted for a resolution, opposed by a 67–30 majority, that would have blocked a $650 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia.

=== Gun control ===
Baldwin was one of 18 senators to sign a letter to Thad Cochran and Barbara Mikulski in 2016 requesting that the Labor, Health and Education subcommittee hold a hearing on whether to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fund a study of gun violence and &quot;the annual appropriations rider that some have interpreted as preventing it&quot; with taxpayer dollars. The senators noted their support for taking steps &quot;to fund gun-violence research, because only the United States government is in a position to establish an integrated public-health research agenda to understand the causes of gun violence and identify the most effective strategies for prevention.&quot;

Baldwin was a cosponsor of the Military Domestic Violence Reporting Enhancement Act in 2017, a bill to create a charge of domestic violence under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and stipulate that convictions must be reported to federal databases to keep abusers from purchasing firearms within three days in an attempt to close a loophole in the UCMJ whereby convicted abusers retain the ability to purchase firearms.

Baldwin was a cosponsor of the NICS Denial Notification Act in 2018, legislation developed in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that would require federal authorities to inform states within a day after a person failing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System attempted to buy a firearm.

In 2022, Baldwin voted for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a gun reform bill introduced after a deadly school shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. The bill enhanced background checks for firearm purchasers under age 21, provided funding for school-based mental health services, and partially closed the gun show loophole and boyfriend loophole.

===Health care===

An outspoken advocate of single-payer, government-run universal health care since her days as a state legislator, Baldwin introduced the Health Security for All Americans Act, which would have required states to provide such a system, in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005. The bill died each time it was introduced without a House vote.

Baldwin has said that she &quot;believes strongly that a single-payer health system is the best way to comprehensively and fairly reform our health care system.&quot; In 2009, she voted for the version of health-care reform that included a public option, a government-run health-care plan that would have competed with private insurers, but only the House passed that version. She ultimately voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which became law in 2010. Baldwin is credited with writing the ACA provision that allows Americans to stay on their parents&#x27; health insurance until age 26. She said she hoped a public option in the ACA would lead to a single-payer system. The first version of the ACA Baldwin voted for included a public option, but the final version did not.

In 2009, Baldwin introduced the Ending LGBT Health Disparities Act (ELHDA), which sought to advance LGBT health priorities by promoting research, cultural competency, and non-discrimination policies. The bill did not pass.

Baldwin was one of five Democratic senators to sign a letter to President Trump in 2017 warning that failure &quot;to take immediate action to oppose the lawsuit or direct House Republicans to forgo this effort will increase instability in the insurance market, as insurers may choose not to participate in the marketplace in 2018&quot; and that they remained concerned that his administration &quot;has still not provided certainty to insurers and consumers that you will protect the cost-sharing subsidies provided under the law.&quot;

Also in 2017, Baldwin wrote an op-ed titled &quot;Why I support Medicare for all and other efforts to expand health coverage.&quot; In 2018 she was one of ten senators to sponsor the Choose Medicare Act, an expanded public option for health insurance that also increased Obamacare subsidies and rendered people with higher incomes eligible for its assistance.

During the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Baldwin was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the FDA&#x27;s efforts to address the shutdown&#x27;s effect on public health and employees while remaining alarmed &quot;that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency&#x27;s employees and the safety and security of the nation&#x27;s food and medical products.&quot;

In 2019, Baldwin was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to insulin manufactures Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi about their increased insulin prices depriving patients of &quot;access to the life-saving medications they need&quot;. She was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act (PCHETA), a bill intended to strengthen training for new and existing physicians, people who teach palliative care, and other providers on the palliative care team that grants patients and their families a voice in their care and treatment goals. In 2022, Baldwin voted with Democrats to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare at $35 a month. The act also allowed Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices.

=== Housing ===

Baldwin was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter in 2019 to the housing subcommittee supporting the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing &quot;HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country&quot; and expressing disappointment that President Trump&#x27;s budget &quot;has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.&quot; The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.

In 2024, Baldwin co-sponsored the Stop Predatory Investing Act to ban corporate investors that buy up more than 50 single-family homes from deducting interest or depreciation on those properties.

===Immigration===
Baldwin voted against building a fence on the U.S.–Mexico border in 2006. She voted in 2013 for S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. She voted against Kate&#x27;s Law in 2016.

===LGBT rights===

In 1993, Baldwin became the first openly lesbian woman elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly and one of few openly LGBT people elected to political offices in the United States at the time of her election.

In 1993, she said she was disappointed by President Bill Clinton&#x27;s support of the military&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy, calling it &quot;a concession to bigotry&quot;. In 1994, she proposed legalizing same-sex marriage in Wisconsin. In 1995, she proposed domestic partnerships in Wisconsin.

In 2018, Baldwin was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rollback of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world had seen LGBTQ people &quot;subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities&quot; and that refusing to let LGBTQ diplomats bring their partners to the U.S. would be equivalent to upholding &quot;the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world&quot;.

In 2019, Baldwin was one of 18 senators to sign a letter to Pompeo requesting an explanation of a State Department decision not to issue an official statement that year commemorating Pride Month or to issue the annual cable outlining activities for embassies commemorating Pride Month. They also asked why the LGBTI special envoy position remained vacant and wrote that &quot;preventing the official flying of rainbow flags and limiting public messages celebrating Pride Month signals to the international community that the United States is abandoning the advancement of LGBTI rights as a foreign policy priority&quot;.

In 2022, Baldwin helped pass the Respect for Marriage Act.

On December 16, 2024, Baldwin led over 20 Democratic senators in introducing an amendment to the Senate version of the NDAA 2025 that removed the restriction on TRICARE coverage for gender-affirming care for minors. The amendment was not brought up for a vote.

===Terrorism===

Baldwin introduced a bill in 2013 that would &quot;bring greater government transparency, oversight and due process whenever authorities use information gathered for intelligence purposes to make domestic non-terrorism cases against Americans.&quot;

She called the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 a &quot;hate crime&quot; and said, &quot;The question now for America is are we going to come together and stand united against hate, gun violence and terrorism?&quot;

Baldwin was one of 22 members of Congress to vote against a 2006 9/11 memorial bill; she said she &quot;voted against the bill because Republicans had inserted provisions praising the Patriot Act and hard-line immigration measures&quot;. She voted nine times in favor of other similar bills.

Her vote received renewed attention in Wisconsin&#x27;s 2012 U.S. Senate race, when Tommy Thompson&#x27;s campaign released an ad about it that PolitiFact rated &quot;Mostly False&quot;. Thompson said, &quot;Wisconsin voters need to know that Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin put her extreme views above honoring the men and women who were murdered by the terrorists in the Sept. 11 attacks on our nation.&quot; PolitiFact wrote, &quot;Thompson said his Democratic challenger voted against a resolution honoring 9/11 victims. Technically, he&#x27;s correct. Baldwin voted against the measure in 2006—and criticized Republicans for adding in references to the Patriot Act, immigration bills, and other controversial matters. But Baldwin has voted nine times in favor of similar resolutions, and the day before the vote in question supported creation of a memorial at the World Trade Center site. Thompson&#x27;s statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. That&#x27;s our definition of Mostly False.&quot;

=== U.S. Postal Service ===
Baldwin was a cosponsor of a bipartisan resolution led by Gary Peters and Jerry Moran in 2019 that opposed privatization of the United States Postal Service (USPS), citing the USPS as a self-sustained establishment and noting concerns that privatization could cause higher prices and reduced services for its customers, especially in rural communities.

=== Veterans ===
In August 2013, Baldwin was one of 23 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Defense Department warning that some payday lenders were &quot;offering predatory loan products to service members at exorbitant triple digit effective interest rates and loan products that do not include the additional protections envisioned by the law&quot; and asserting that service members and their families &quot;deserve the strongest possible protections and swift action to ensure that all forms of credit offered to members of our armed forces are safe and sound.&quot;

In January 2015, &quot;USA Today&quot; obtained a copy of a report by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general about the Tomah, Wisconsin Veterans Affairs medical facility. The report said that two physicians at the Tomah VA were among the biggest prescribers of opioids in a multi-state region, raising &quot;potentially serious concerns&quot;. Baldwin&#x27;s office had received the report in August 2014 but did not take action until January 2015, when Baldwin called for an investigation after the Center for Investigative Reporting published details of the report, including information about a veteran who died from an overdose at the facility. A whistleblower and former Tomah VA employee learned that Baldwin&#x27;s office had a copy of the report, and repeatedly emailed Baldwin&#x27;s office asking that she take action on the issue. Baldwin&#x27;s office did not explain why they waited from August 2014 to January 2015 to call for an investigation. Baldwin was the only member of Congress who had a copy of the report.

In February 2015, Baldwin fired her deputy state director over her handling of the VA report. The aide was offered but declined a severance deal that included a cash payout and a confidentiality agreement that would have required her to keep quiet. The aide filed an ethics complaint with the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The complaint was dismissed as lacking merit. Baldwin said, &quot;we should have done a better job listening to and communicating with another constituent with whom we were working on problems at the VA&quot;, and that she had started a review of why her office had failed to act on the report. As a result of the review, Baldwin fined her chief of staff, demoted her state director, and reassigned a veterans&#x27; outreach staffer. In 2016, Baldwin introduced a bill named after the affected veteran, Jason Simcakoski, to strengthen opioid prescribing practices and guidelines at the VA. In November 2017, Baldwin co-sponsored legislation designed to strengthen opioid safety in the Department of Veterans Affairs.

In 2021, Baldwin co-sponsored a bill to expand VA health benefits for veterans who were exposed to burn pits at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base in Uzbekistan, also known as K2 Air Base.

==Personal life==
Baldwin is the granddaughter of biochemist David E. Green and the niece of another biochemist, Rowena Green Matthews. She is also a third cousin of comedian and actor Andy Samberg.

Baldwin was in a relationship with Lauren Azar for 15 years; the couple registered as domestic partners in Wisconsin in 2009. They separated in 2010. Baldwin was baptized Episcopalian but considers herself &quot;unaffiliated&quot; with a religion.

Baldwin owns a home in Madison. She also owns an apartment in Washington D.C.. 

In 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, &quot;Queerty&quot; named Baldwin one of 50 heroes &quot;leading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people&quot;.

<text>The Coronation (Russian: Коронация, или Последний из романов, &quot;Coronation, or the Last of the Romanovs&quot;) is a historical detective novel by Boris Akunin, published originally in 2000. It is subtitled &quot;великосветский детектив&quot; (&quot;high-society detective&quot;). This novel was published in English in February 2009.

The scene of this seventh novel in the Erast Fandorin series is set in 1896 Moscow, at the time of the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II (between 6 May and 20 May O.S.). Akunin prominently features the Khodynka Tragedy of 18 May 1896, when a crowd at the coronation festival stampeded and nearly 1400 people were killed.

The book won the Russian Anti-Booker prize in 2000 for prose. Many Akunin fans in Russia state this book is his best, reading about the tragic atmosphere of late 19th century Russia. However, members of the Russian Orthodox Church objected to the negative portrayal of many members of the Romanov family, especially the characterization of the character Grand Duke Simeon Alexandrovich as a homosexual.

==Plot==
The story is told from the perspective of Afanasi Ziukin, the majordomo of Grand Duke George Alexandrovich. Erast Fandorin investigates the abduction of Grand Duke Mikhail, the four-year-old youngest son of George Alexandrovitch, by criminal mastermind &quot;Doctor Lind&quot; whom Fandorin has been pursuing for several years. Their initial confrontation is briefly described in the novella &quot;Dream Valley&quot; from the &quot;Jade Rosary Beads&quot; collection. This time, Lind demands the Orlov diamond, a prerequisite for the upcoming coronation, as a ransom. Nicholas II is portrayed as dependent on his uncles Cyril and Simeon, the Governor-General of Moscow.

Akunin distorts the Romanov family relations somewhat. The three uncles of Nicolas II (sons of Alexander II) are semi-fictitious:

*George Alexandrovich, named after George Alexandrovitch, Nicholas&#x27; younger brother, but based on Nicholas&#x27; brother-in-law Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich.
*Simeon Alexandrovich, the Governor General of Moscow is based on Nicholas&#x27; real uncle Sergei Alexandrovich.
*Cyril Alexandrovich is based on Nicholas&#x27; real uncle Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, and named after Cyril, Vladimir&#x27;s son.

==Title==
The original Russian title, &quot;Коронация, или Последний из романов&quot;, could be literally translated as &quot;Coronation, or the Last of the novels&quot; (note the lack of capitalization on the last Russian word). The title is however to be understood as &quot;The Last of the Romanovs&quot;, although the last word should then have been Романовых. The reason for the broken Russian in the title becomes apparent only at the very end of the book, where an Englishman says this phrase using his dictionary, failing to inflect the last word correctly. 
Despite its title, this is not the last Fandorin novel. The title of the German translation is : Die Entführung des Großfürsten, subtitled: Fandorin ermittelt (translation: The Grand Duke&#x27;s abduction).

<doc id="409037" wikidata="Q469139" url="?curid=409037" title="Grace Napolitano">
<text>Graciela &quot;Grace&quot; Napolitano ( ; née Flores; born December 4, 1936) is an American Democratic Party politician who represented California&#x27;s San Gabriel Valley and other parts of Los Angeles County in the United States House of Representatives from 1999 to 2025. Her district is currently numbered . She previously served in the California State Assembly and the Norwalk City Council. At the age of , Napolitano was the oldest sitting member of the House of Representatives at the time of her departure.

Napolitano represented the 34th district from 1999 to 2003, the 38th district from 2003 to 2013, and the 32nd district from 2013 to 2023. Due to redistricting, Napolitano ran for and won reelection in the 2012 United States elections in against Republican nominee David Miller. In the 2014 midterm elections, Napolitano was reelected, defeating Republican nominee Arturo Alas.

In July 2023, Napolitano announced that she would not be running for re-election in 2024.

==Early life, education and career==
Napolitano was born and raised in Brownsville, Texas. After high school, she married Federico &quot;Fred&quot; Musquiz and moved with her husband to Norwalk, California, where they raised five children. After Musquiz&#x27;s death in 1980, she married Frank Napolitano in 1982.

Napolitano began her political career as a member of the Norwalk City Council, winning her first election in 1986 by 28 votes. Four years later, she was reelected by the largest margin recorded in city history. In 1989, Napolitano&#x27;s council colleagues elevated her to serve as mayor. During her council tenure, she focused much of her attention on providing access to constituents and on redevelopment and transportation issues to address the city&#x27;s need for jobs and a more diversified economic base.

Napolitano made her way up through the ranks of Ford Motor Company for 21 years. After her retirement in 1992, she was elected to the California Assembly and became a leader in international trade, environmental protection, transportation and immigration. In 1996 she requested and received the creation of the first new California State Assembly Standing Committee in nine years, the Committee on International Trade, which she chaired until being termed out in 1998. In her six years in the Assembly, she also served as chair of the Women&#x27;s Caucus and vice chair of the Latino caucus.

Napolitano is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

==== 1998 ====
In 1998, Napolitano was termed out of the State Assembly and decided to run for a State Senate seat being vacated by Charles Calderon. She would be facing a difficult race against fellow termed-out Assemblywoman Martha Escutia. Three days before the candidate filing deadline, U.S. Representative Esteban Torres announced his retirement, hoping the late timing of his decision would help his son-in-law, James &quot;Jamie&quot; Casso, win the seat. Napolitano switched races at the last moment and narrowly defeated Casso in the Democratic primary, 51% to 49%.

A 2009 story first reported by Bloomberg News and further detailed by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; questioned the personal loan interest rate that the Federal Election Commission authorized Napolitano to use during her 1998 campaign for Congress. Both Bloomberg and the &quot;Times&quot; noted that the FEC had accepted the argument that the 18% rate was equivalent to the early withdrawal penalty that Napolitano was subject to by withdrawing $150,000 from her employee retirement fund and then lending that money to her campaign. Both sources also reported the rate dropping to 10% in 2006, and cited FEC filings as of December 31, 2009, indicating that $221,780 in interest had been paid. &quot;The Hill&quot; reported that FEC filings for the campaign reporting period ending September 30, 2010, indicated that the debt had been completely retired.

In July 2023, Napolitano announced her intention to retire from Congress and not seek re-election in 2024.

=== Tenure ===
In 2011, Napolitano voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.

====Natural Resources Committee====
Napolitano has been a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources since the 106th Congress and was selected as chair of the Water and Power Subcommittee for the 110th Congress. She has promoted conservation, water recycling, desalination, and sound groundwater management and storage to address Southern California&#x27;s need for adequate water quality and supply. She is proud of her legislative efforts on a number of fronts—assisting in the implementation of the CALFED Bay-Delta Program, a water management plan for the State of California, protection of the ecosystem in the Bay-Delta and promotion of the use of advanced technologies. She is also a member of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.

====Transportation and Infrastructure Committee====
At the start of the 110th Congress, Napolitano became the most senior new member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with jurisdiction over America&#x27;s aviation system, surface transportation, freight and passenger rail, the inland waterway system, international maritime commerce, the Economic Development Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; support of the nation&#x27;s water resources, and the federal clean water program. Napolitano&#x27;s experience includes six years on the California State Assembly Transportation Committee, and current work on rail safety and congestion relief in the San Gabriel Valley.

Hearings:
*&quot;Oversight of U.S. Airline Customer Service: May 2, 2017&quot;. Napolitano posed questions to the witnesses, including Oscar Munoz, after committee chair Bill Shuster left his chair. Her questions were critical of the airlines&#x27; plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and increasing demands that airlines make of flight attendants. William J. McGee, the country&#x27;s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was &quot;an excellent question because… right now we have a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations. Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but we have asked them to be bouncers, and police officers, and all kinds of other things, so there is no question that there is an issue of training as well.&quot;

====Congressional Mental Health Caucus====
Statistics showing one in three Latina adolescents contemplated suicide prompted Napolitano to spearhead a school-based Latina adolescent mental health program in three local middle schools and one high school. She and Tim Murphy co-chair the Congressional Mental Health Caucus. The bipartisan caucus included more than 70 members during the 108th Congress and over 90 members during the 109th Congress. As co-chair, Napolitano has hosted congressional briefings on children&#x27;s and veteran&#x27;s mental health needs, working on proposals to improve VA mental health services. A key priority is legislation to provide mental health parity in health insurance.

====Congressional Hispanic Caucus====
During the 109th Congress, Napolitano chaired the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which continues to address national education, immigration, health, and civil rights issues, and the impact these policies have on the Hispanic community.

===Abortion===
Napolitano opposed the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling it &quot;abhorrent&quot; and a &quot;dreadfully sad and dark day when you wake up with fewer and diminished rights in the United States of America.&quot;

==Personal life==
Napolitano was married to Frank Napolitano, a restaurateur and community activist, from the early 1980s until his death from cancer on December 15, 2017, aged 90. Grace Napolitano had five children from a previous marriage, which ended with her husband&#x27;s death. In 2013, their daughter Yolanda Maria Louwers died of cancer. Louwers was regularly on the campaign trail with Napolitano throughout her political career.

<doc id="409041" wikidata="Q5933543" url="?curid=409041" title="Hughie Edwards">
<text>Air Commodore Sir Hughie Idwal Edwards, (1 August 1914 – 5 August 1982) was a senior officer in the Royal Air Force, Governor of Western Australia, and an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Serving as a bomber pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF), Edwards was decorated with the Victoria Cross in 1941 for his efforts in leading a bombing raid against the port of Bremen, one of the most heavily defended towns in Germany. He became the most highly decorated Australian serviceman of the Second World War.

Born in Fremantle, Western Australia, Edwards joined the Royal Australian Air Force in 1935, and a year later was granted a short service commission with the RAF. Serving throughout the Second World War, he gained a permanent commission and continued his career in the RAF after the war; he retired in 1963 with the rank of air commodore. Returning to Australia, he was appointed Governor of Western Australia in 1974.

==Early life==
Edwards was born in Fremantle, Western Australia, on 1 August 1914, the third of five children to Welsh parents Hugh, a blacksmith and farrier, and his wife Jane (née Watkins), who had emigrated to Australia in 1909. Named after his father, he was always referred to by his middle name of Idwal in his family. Edwards received his initial education at White Gum Valley School, before attending the Fremantle Boys&#x27; School where he achieved well academically, although he later claimed this was due to a good memory rather than high intelligence. However, Edwards was reluctantly forced to leave school at the age of fourteen as the family finances could no longer support him. Described as a &quot;shy, under-confident, introspective and imaginative lad&quot; at this stage in his life, he gained employment as a shipping office clerk.

With the onset of the Great Depression, Edwards found himself unemployed, before gaining a job with a horse racing stable in Fremantle. His position entailed him taking the horses to the beach each morning for a swim, grooming them, and attending the twice weekly race meetings; a lifelong interest in horse racing consequently emerged at this time. After later working for a brief period in a factory, he enlisted in the Australian Army in March 1934 and was posted to the 6th Heavy Battery, Royal Australian Artillery, with the rank of private. During this period, Edwards was an active sportsman, excelling in Australian rules football—where he played six matches with leading Western Australian Football League (WAFL) club South Fremantle—and cricket with the Fremantle garrison team.

==Early Air Force career==
In 1935, he was selected for flying training with the Royal Australian Air Force at RAAF Point Cook, after which he transferred to the RAF, being granted a short service commission as a pilot officer on 21 August 1936. Posted to No. 15 Bomber Squadron, he was appointed adjutant of No. 90 Squadron in March 1937, flying Bristol Blenheim bombers. He received a promotion to flying officer on 21 May 1938.

In August 1938, Edwards was piloting a Blenheim near the Scottish border when he flew into a storm at . When the ailerons froze, the aircraft was forced down to and Edwards ordered the navigator and rear gunner to bail out of the aircraft. Down to , he made an effort to jump clear, but his parachute became entangled with the bomber&#x27;s radio mast pylon. In the ensuing crash, he sustained head injuries and a badly broken leg, which was only saved after extensive surgery, which left that leg shorter than the other. After the accident, he was declared unfit for flying duties until April 1940, when he was posted to No. 139 Squadron for active service due to the outbreak of war. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 21 May 1940.

==Second World War==
In May 1941, Edwards became commanding officer of No. 105 Squadron replacing the previous incumbent, who had been killed in an anti-shipping raid on Stavanger. At that time, the Squadron was engaged in a series of daylight operations against Germany and the occupied countries, with its principal targets being enemy shipping, power installations, shipbuilding yards, locomotives, steelworks and marshalling yards. On 15 June, by now an acting wing commander, Edwards led six Blenheims on a search for enemy shipping and soon sighted a convoy of eight merchantmen anchored near The Hague. He launched an attack at low level, his bombs striking a 4,000-ton ship. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this action.

On 4 July 1941, Edwards led a daylight attack (&quot;Operation Wreckage&quot;) against the port of Bremen, one of the most heavily defended towns in Germany. Edwards&#x27; force of twelve Blenheims attacked at a height of about 50 feet through telephone wires and high voltage power lines. The bombers successfully penetrated fierce anti-aircraft fire and a dense balloon barrage, but further fire over the port itself resulted in the loss of four of the attacking force. Edwards brought his remaining aircraft safely back, although all had been hit and his own Blenheim (serial V6028) had been hit over 20 times. His actions in the raid earned him the Victoria Cross.

The full citation for Edwards&#x27; Victoria Cross appeared in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 22 July 1941, it read:

In July 1941, Edwards took the Squadron to Malta, in order to conduct operations against Axis shipping carrying reinforcements from Italy to Tripoli and Benghazi. The unit remained in the area until October, when they returned to Britain. Participating in a goodwill mission to the United States, he was appointed chief flying instructor at Wellesbourne Mountford, (Number 22 Operational Training Unit) in January 1942, before re-assuming command of No. 105 Squadron on 3 August. During this time, Edwards married Cherry Kyrle &quot;Pat&quot; Beresford; the pair were later to have a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Sarah. He was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1 September.

On 6 December 1942, Edwards participated in a daylight bombing raid on the Philips Factory at Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Despite heavy opposition, the bombers successfully damaged or destroyed many of their targets, with two gun posts being silenced. Several members of the raid were decorated, including Edwards, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Order; becoming the first airman to receive the Victoria Cross, Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross in the Second World War. Promoted to acting group captain, he assumed command of the bomber station at Binbrook in February 1943, where, despite his senior position, he continued to participate in operations. On 18 August, he was promoted to war substantive wing commander.

With the end of the European campaigns in sight, Edwards was transferred to the Pacific theatre, first to Ceylon as Group Captain, Bomber Operations. In January 1945, he was mentioned in despatches, and appointed the senior administrative staff officer at Headquarters, South East Asia Command; serving in this position until the conclusion of the war.

==Later career==
Edwards continued his career in the post-war RAF, and was granted the substantive rank of squadron leader from 1 September 1945. Posted as a staff officer at Air Headquarters, Malaya, from November 1945 until February 1946, he served with the Netherlands East Indies Forces for a short period before returning to Malaya as air adviser to the General Officer Commanding. In September 1945, he was posted as station commander at the RAF Base in Kuala Lumpur; he remained there until May 1947, and was awarded an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services in south-east Asia.

Returning to Britain in June 1947, he undertook a six-month course at the Staff College, before receiving a two-year posting as senior personnel staff officer of No. 21 Group, Flying Training Command. Promoted to wing commander on 1 July 1947, his next posting was as the senior instructor on the leadership course at Digby, Lincolnshire. Subsequently, he was appointed station commander at Wattisham, Suffolk. He was promoted to group captain on 1 January 1954. Edwards was the Station Commander of the RAF base RAF Habbaniya in Iraq during the Suez Crisis of 1956, and also the critical time of the Iraqi Revolution of 14 July 1958. He returned to Britain on 21 October 1958 to command the Central Fighter Establishment, West Raynham, with the acting rank of air commodore.

Awarded a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1959 New Year Honours, he was promoted to the substantive rank of air commodore on 1 July 1959, and appointed as an aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II in March 1960. His final appointment with the RAF was as Director of Establishments at the Air Ministry, London, from January 1962 until his retirement on 30 September 1963.

==Later life and governorship==

Returning to Australia, Edwards became the Australian Representative for Selection Trust. In 1966 his wife, Cherry, died; he married Dorothy Carew Berrick in 1972. The pair were said to complement each other well, as Dorothy limped on her left leg after being knocked over by a car on a crosswalk in Sydney in 1970, while Edwards limped with his right after his flying accident in 1938. In 1974, Edwards relinquished his position as the Australian Representative for Selection Trust and was appointed Governor of Western Australia. He was sworn in on 7 January 1974, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) the following October.

His knighthood involved some controversy, following his wife&#x27;s public comment that he was the only Australian state governor without such an honour. As knighthoods were then conferred by the Queen on the recommendation of her Federal and State governments, and the Governor was the Queen&#x27;s representative in the state, this was seen as highly inappropriate, especially given the Western Australian Labor State government of the day, led by John Tonkin had a policy of not recommending Imperial Honours. However, the Tonkin Government was defeated in April 1974 and the incoming Liberal Premier, Sir Charles Court, was happy to make the necessary recommendation.

While Governor, Edwards&#x27; first official role was to christen Alan Bond&#x27;s America Cup challenger, &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. One of the couple&#x27;s first visitors to the Governor&#x27;s estate was a man by the name of Thomas Dunhill, who had consumed ten beers and wanted to see the house. Lady Edwards apparently found him in the pantry; he was arrested by the police but no charges were laid. Ill health forced Edwards to resign his vice-regal appointment on 2 April 1975, and he and Lady Edwards went to live in Sydney, where he continued in semi-retirement with commercial interests.

On 5 August 1982, while on his way to attend a Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Edwards unexpectedly collapsed and died; his ashes were buried in the Karrakatta Cemetery, Perth, after a State Funeral and cremation at Northern Suburbs Crematorium in Sydney. His Victoria Cross is on display at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, and on 26 November 2002 a life-size bronze statue depicting Edwards was unveiled by then Governor of Western Australia, John Sanderson, in Kings Square, Fremantle. The Hugh Edwards Ward at Hollywood Private Hospital has been named in his honour.

<text>The United Democratic Party (Spanish: &quot;Partido Democrático Unido&quot;; abbreviated UDP) is one of the two major political parties in Belize. It is currently the main opposition party, having lost the 2020 Belizean general election, after previously holding the government across three prior terms. Founded as a centre-right conservative party, the UDP is led by Moses Barrow.

==History==

=== Foundation and early history ===

In 1973 political opposition in Belize was weak and the ruling People&#x27;s United Party (PUP) had never lost a legislative election since its foundation. The main opposition parties, the National Independence Party and the People&#x27;s Development Movement met together with a new Liberal Party to consider forming an alliance to fight the PUP. The resulting merger formed the United Democratic Party on 27 September 1973. Controversially, a significant portion of the United Black Association for Development also voted to join the UDP upon foundation.

The UDP&#x27;s first electoral test was the 1974 general election in which it fielded candidates nationwide except in Corozal District, where it supported candidates from the Corozal United Front. It won six seats, and was within 18 votes of winning three more. Former People&#x27;s Development Movement head Dean Lindo was subsequently named party leader. The party had success in municipal elections during the 1970s, but failed to defeat the PUP in the 1979 general elections. Its representation in the House of Representatives dropped to five seats and party leader Lindo lost his seat to Said Musa and was replaced as leader by Theodore Aranda. Despite internal divisions, the party retained control of three towns in the December 1981 municipal elections.

=== 1983–present ===
In late 1982, Aranda was removed as party leader and replaced by Curl Thompson, who would later be replaced by former Liberal Party leader Manuel Esquivel following a convention. In December 1983, the UDP won Belize City Council election.

The party was victorious in the 1984 general election, winning 21 of the 28 seats. Esquivel became the first UDP member elected Prime Minister. The party went on to lost power in the 1989 elections, winning 13 seats to the PUP&#x27;s 15.

For the 1993 elections the party formed an alliance with the National Alliance for Belizean Rights. The alliance won 16 of the 29 seats, with the UDP taking fifteen. However, they were soundly defeated in the 1998 elections as the PUP won 26 of the 29 seats, after which Esquivel was replaced by Barrow as party leader. The PUP remained in power following the 2003 elections, in which the UDP only won seven seats. After ten years in opposition, the UDP won the 2008 general elections, taking 25 of the 31 seats.

In 2020, UDP Prime Minister Dean Barrow called for elections to take place in November 2020. This was during the global COVID-19 pandemic which had hit the country&#x27;s economy hard. The pandemic, along with impacts of Hurricane Eta, caused significant voter discontent with the current government. Ultimately, the UDP suffered one of the worst results in the party&#x27;s history, winning only 5 of the 31 seats.

<doc id="409045" wikidata="Q1333928" url="?curid=409045" title="Maxfield Parrish">
<text>Maxfield Parrish (July 25, 1870 – March 30, 1966) was an American painter and illustrator active in the first half of the 20th century. His works featured distinctive saturated hues and idealized neo-classical imagery. The National Museum of American Illustration deemed his painting &quot;Daybreak&quot; (1922) to be the most successful art print of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Maxfield Parrish was born in Philadelphia to painter and etcher Stephen Parrish and Elizabeth Bancroft. His given name was Frederick Parrish, but he later adopted Maxfield, his paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name, as his middle, then finally as his professional name. He was raised in a Quaker society. As a child he began drawing for his own amusement, showed talent, and his parents encouraged him. Between 1884 and 1886, his parents took Parrish to Europe, where he toured England, Italy, and France, was exposed to architecture and the paintings by the old masters, and studied at the Paris school of Dr. Kornemann.

He attended the Haverford School and later studied architecture at Haverford College for two years beginning in 1888. To further his education in art, from 1892 to 1895 he studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under artists Robert Vonnoh and Thomas Pollock Anshutz. After graduating from the program, Parrish went to Annisquam, Massachusetts, where he and his father shared a painting studio. A year later, with his father&#x27;s encouragement, he attended the Drexel Institute of Art, Science &amp; Industry where he studied with Howard Pyle.

==Career==
Parrish entered into an artistic career that lasted for more than half a century, and which helped shape the Golden Age of illustration and American visual arts. During his career, he produced almost 900 pieces of art including calendars, greeting cards, and magazine covers. Parrish&#x27;s early works were mostly in black and white.

In 1895, his work was on the Easter edition of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar.&quot; He also did work for other magazines like &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine.&quot; One of his posters for &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; was published in Les Maîtres de l&#x27;Affiche. He also illustrated a children&#x27;s book in 1897, &quot;Mother Goose in Prose&quot; written by L. Frank Baum. By 1900, Parrish was already a member of the Society of American Artists. In 1903, he traveled to Europe again to visit Italy.

Parrish took many commissions for commercial art until the 1920s. 
Parrish&#x27;s commercial art included many prestigious projects, among which were Eugene Field&#x27;s &quot;Poems of Childhood&quot; in 1904, and such traditional works as &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; in 1909. Books illustrated by Parrish are featured in &quot;A Wonder Book and Tanglewood Tales&quot; in 1910, &quot;The Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics&quot; in 1911, and &quot;The Knave of Hearts&quot; in 1925.

Parrish was earning over $100,000 per year by 1910, when homes could be bought for $2,000.

In 1910 Parrish received a commission to create 18 panels to go into the Girls Dining Room of the Curtis Publishing Company building, then under construction at 6th and Walnut in Philadelphia. It would take him six years to finish the monumental project. In 1914, before the murals were completed, Curtis commissioned Parrish to design a mural for the building lobby. Tiffany Studios constructed a favrile glass mosaic mural titled &quot;The Dream Garden&quot;, which is now a part of Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts collection.

Parrish worked with popular magazines throughout the 1910s and 1920s, including &quot;Hearst&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;. He also created advertising for companies like Wanamaker&#x27;s, Edison-Mazda Lamps, Colgate and Oneida Cutlery. Parrish worked with &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; from 1904 to 1913. He received a contract to deal with them exclusively for six years. He also painted advertisements for D.M. Ferry Seed Company in 1916 and 1923, which helped him gain recognition in the eye of the public. His most well-known art work is &quot;Daybreak&quot; which was produced in 1923. It features female figures in a landscape scene. The painting also has undertones of Parrish blue. In the 1920s, however, Parrish turned away from illustration and concentrated on painting.
In his forties, Parrish began working on large murals instead of just focusing on children&#x27;s books. His works of art often featured androgynous nudes in fantastical settings. He made his living from posters and calendars featuring his works. Beginning in 1904, Susan Lewin (1889-1978) posed for many works, and became Parrish&#x27;s longtime assistant. From 1918 to 1934, Parrish worked on calendar illustrations for General Electric.

In 1931, Parrish declared to the Associated Press, &quot;I&#x27;m done with girls on rocks&quot;, and opted instead to focus on landscapes. By 1935, Parrish exclusively painted landscapes. Though never as popular as his earlier works, he profited from them. He would often build scale models of the imaginary landscapes he wished to paint, using various lighting setups before deciding on a preferred view, which he would photograph as a basis for the painting (see for example, &quot;The Millpond&quot;). He lived in Plainfield, New Hampshire, near the Cornish Art Colony, and painted until he was 91 years old. He was also an avid machinist, and often referred to himself as &quot;a mechanic who loved to paint&quot;.

==Technique==

Parrish&#x27;s art is characterized by vibrant colors; the color &quot;Parrish blue&quot; was named after him. He achieved such luminous color through glazing. This process involves applying layers of translucent paint and oil medium (glazes) over a base rendering. Parrish usually used a blue and white monochromatic underpainting.

His paintings/illustrations were unique in that they depicted a highly idealized fantasy world that was accessible to the general public. Although you will rarely see a glimpse of that color in reality, he was and still is linked with a particularly bright shade of blue that coated the skies of his landscapes. And it was not an easy task for him to complete. He invented a time-consuming process that involved a cobalt blue base and white undercoating, which he then coated with a series of thin alternating coatings of oil and varnish. When exposed to ultraviolet light, the resins he employed, known as Damar, fluoresce a shade of yellow-green, giving the painted sky its distinctive turquoise tint.

Parrish used many other innovative techniques in his paintings. He would take pictures of models in black and white geometric prints and project the image onto his works. This technique allowed for his figures to be clothed in geometric patterns, while accurately representing distortion and draping. Parrish would also create his paintings by taking pictures, enlarging, or projecting objects. He would cut these images out and put them onto his canvas. He would later cover them with clear glaze. Parrish&#x27;s technique gave his paintings a more three-dimensional feel.

The outer proportions and internal divisions of Parrish&#x27;s compositions were carefully calculated in accordance with geometric principles such as root rectangles and the golden ratio. In this Parrish was influenced by Jay Hambidge&#x27;s theory of Dynamic Symmetry.

==Cultural influences==

Parrish&#x27;s works continue to influence pop culture. The cover of the 1985 Bloom County cartoon collection &quot;Penguin Dreams and Stranger Things&quot; comprises elements of &quot;Daybreak&quot;, &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot;, and &quot;The Lute Players&quot;. The poster for &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; was inspired by &quot;Daybreak&quot;. In 2001, Parrish was featured in a United States Post Office commemorative stamp series honoring American illustrators, including Parrish.

The 1986 television commercial announcing Nestle&#x27;s Alpine White chocolate bar, entitled &quot;Sweet Dreams,&quot; staged live-action representations of Parrish&#x27;s &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;Dinky Bird&quot;, and &quot;Daybreak&quot;.

The Elton John album &quot;Caribou&quot; has a Parrish-inspired background. The Moody Blues album &quot;The Present&quot; uses a variation of the Parrish painting &quot;Daybreak&quot; for its cover. In 1984, Dali&#x27;s Car, the British New Wave project of Peter Murphy and Mick Karn, used &quot;Daybreak&quot; as the cover art of their only album, &quot;The Waking Hour&quot;. The Irish musician Enya has been inspired by the works of Parrish. The cover art of her 1995 album &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; is based on his painting &quot;The Young King of the Black Isles&quot;. A number of her music videos include Parrish imagery, including &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot;.

In the 1995 music video &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, Michael Jackson and his then wife Lisa Marie Presley appear semi-nude in emulation of &quot;Daybreak&quot;. The Italian singer-songwriter Angelo Branduardi&#x27;s fourth album &quot;La pulce d&#x27;acqua&quot; of 1977 featured nine inlay full colour print reproductions of painter Mario Convertino&#x27;s works; one of them is clearly inspired by Parrish&#x27;s &quot;Stars&quot;.

The original painting of &quot;Daybreak&quot; sold in 2006 for US$7.6 million. The National Museum of American Illustration claims the largest body of his work in any collection, with sixty-nine works by Parrish including the 1910 Curtis Publishing Company&#x27;s 18-panel mural commission. Some of his works are located at the Hood Museum of Art in Hanover, New Hampshire, and a few at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The San Diego Museum of Art organized and toured a collection of his work in 2005.

The American painter Norman Rockwell referred to Parrish as &quot;my idol&quot;.

In Alan Moore&#x27;s 32-issue comic series Promethea, the cover of Issue #13 was noted by the artist on the cover as &quot;after Parrish&quot;, imitating his style.

==Personal life==

While studying at Drexel, Parrish met his future wife, Lydia Ambler Austin, who was a drawing teacher. The couple were married on June 1, 1895, and moved to Philadelphia. They would go on to have four children together. In 1898, Parrish moved to Plainfield, New Hampshire, with his family and built a home that was later nicknamed &quot;The Oaks&quot;. The home and an adjacent studio were surrounded by beautiful landscapes that inspired Parrish&#x27;s drawings.

Parrish suffered from tuberculosis for a time in 1900. While sick, he discovered how to mix oils and glazes to create vibrant colors.

From 1900 to 1902, Parrish painted in Saranac Lake, New York, and Castle Hot Springs, Arizona, to further recover his health.

Parrish&#x27;s youngest child, Jean, posed for &quot;Ecstasy&quot; just before leaving for Smith College. Jean was the only child to follow her parents&#x27; profession.

Parrish developed arthritis. He accepted his last commission in the late 1950s. By 1960 his arthritis prevented him from painting. He died on March 30, 1966, in Plainfield, New Hampshire, at the age of 95.

<text>Patrick Hannan (baptised 26 April 1840 – 4 November 1925) was a gold prospector whose lucrative discovery on 14 June 1893 set off a major gold rush in the area now known as Kalgoorlie-Boulder in Western Australia.

The resulting goldfield has been mined ever since and is renowned as &quot;The Golden Mile&quot;, the richest square mile in the world. The modern open-cut mine is a vast, astonishing sight known as the Super Pit.

Hannan from Quin, County Clare, and his partners Thomas Flanagan from Ennis, County Clare and Daniel Shea from County Cork, are still remembered and celebrated in Australia and in Ireland.

==Early life==
Paddy Hannan was the son of John Hannan and Bridget Lynch, and was baptised on 26 April 1840 in the town of Quin, County Clare, Ireland. His baptismal record shows that his godparents (sponsors) were Margaret Lynch and John O&#x27;Brien. Many of the people in his family emigrated to Australia from 1852 onwards, and close ties were maintained. Two of Hannan&#x27;s nieces would welcome Hannan into their house for the last years of his life.

Hannan emigrated to Australia when he was 22, arriving in Melbourne on 23 December 1862 aboard the &quot;Henry Fernie&quot; from Liverpool. He is recorded in the passenger list as Pat Hannan, a labourer.

==Prospecting success==
In 1893 in Western Australia, Hannan and his partners were the first to find gold near Mount Charlotte, less than 40 kilometres from the existing Coolgardie Goldfields. Hannan, Flanagan and Shea were following a large number of prospectors who set out for a rumoured new prospect at Mount Youle.

One version of the story of the find has it that on the night of 14 June 1893, Hannan found gold in a gully. Not wanting to cause a rush, he concealed the find. During the night the trio moved one of their horses into the scrub. The following morning Hannan informed the main party they were going to stay behind to find their lost horse. After the main group moved off east, the three men started to pick up the gold and peg out their lease.

Amongst the various counter-claims to emerge over the years, one lively version of the story was told in 1909 by Fred Dugan (another prospector, who was present at the time) relating how Thomas Flanagan found the first nuggets, and covered his find with brushwood to conceal it until the following day.

By law, those finding &quot;payable&quot; gold were required to report the fact to the warden&#x27;s office within seven days, so Hannan set off for Coolgardie to register their find, doing so on 17 June 1893.

It has been suggested that Hannan, rather than Flanagan or Shea, was chosen to officially register the claim because only he could read and write, but there is evidence that Flanagan was literate, since, in 1864, he had clearly signed the official death certificate of his brother John Flanagan, and had written his own place of residence at the time - White Hills (in Bendigo, Victoria, Australia).

The other possible reasons for Hannan going alone to the office at Coolgardie are set out by Martyn Webb, who relates that:

Hannan registered the claim in Flanagan&#x27;s name as well as his own. Within hours a stampede began. It was estimated that about 400 men were prospecting in the area within three days, and over 1,000 within a week.

==Final years==
In 1904, at the age of sixty-four, Hannan was granted an annual pension of £150 by the Government of Western Australia.

Having searched for gold throughout his adult life, he did not cease his prospecting activities until after 1910, his seventieth year. At that time he went to live with two of his nieces in Fallon Street, Brunswick, Victoria (close to the city of Melbourne).

He died there in 1925 and was buried in Melbourne General Cemetery, in the Catholic section, near the North Gate.

In 1993 his grave was restored by the citizens of Kalgoorlie, led by Tess Thomson, as a part of the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the original find by Hannan, Flanagan and Shea.

==Legacy==

In memory of a man who is regarded as the founder of Kalgoorlie, the main street and a suburb in Kalgoorlie both bear Hannan&#x27;s name, and in 1929 a statue of him by the sculptor John MacLeod was erected there.

The city boasts several commemorative plaques to the three Irishmen, Hannan, Flanagan and Shea. A popular Irish pub at the Burswood Entertainment Complex was also named after Hannan.

In Ireland there is a plaque dedicated to his memory opposite Quin Abbey, Quin, County Clare, and there is a bust with an explanatory dedication on display inside the DeValera Library in Ennis, County Clare.

<doc id="409052" wikidata="Q203966" url="?curid=409052" title="Paul Ryan">
<text>Paul Davis Ryan (born January 29, 1970) is an American politician who served as the 54th speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 2015 to 2019. A member of the Republican Party, he was the party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee in the 2012 election running alongside Mitt Romney, losing to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.

Ryan is a native of Janesville, Wisconsin, and graduated from Miami University in 1992. He spent five years working for Congress in Washington, D.C., becoming a speechwriter, then returned to Wisconsin in 1997 to work at his family&#x27;s construction company. He was elected to Congress to represent the following year, replacing Mark Neumann, who had vacated the seat to run for U.S. Senate. Ryan went on to represent the district for 20 years. He chaired the House Budget Committee from 2011 to 2015, and briefly chaired the House Ways and Means Committee in 2015.

A self-proclaimed deficit hawk, Ryan was a major proponent of Social Security privatization in the mid-2000s. During the 2010s, two proposals heavily influenced by Ryan—&quot;The Path to Prosperity&quot; and &quot;A Better Way&quot;—became part of the national dialogue advocating for the privatization of Medicare, the conversion of Medicaid into a block grant program, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and significant federal tax cuts. In October 2015, after Speaker John Boehner&#x27;s resignation, Ryan was elected to replace him. During his speakership, he played a key role in the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018, which partially repealed the Dodd–Frank Act.

Ryan declined to run for re-election in the 2018 midterm elections. With the Democratic Party taking control of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi succeeded Ryan as Speaker of the House.

==Early life and education==
Paul Davis Ryan was born on January 29, 1970, in Janesville, Wisconsin, the youngest of four children of Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Ann (née Hutter), who later became an interior designer, and Paul Murray Ryan, a lawyer. He is a fifth-generation Wisconsinite. His father was of Irish ancestry and his mother of German and English descent. One of Ryan&#x27;s paternal ancestors settled in Wisconsin prior to the Civil War. His great-grandfather, Patrick William Ryan, founded an earthmoving company in 1884, which later became P. W. Ryan and Sons and is now known as Ryan Incorporated Central. Ryan&#x27;s grandfather, Stanley M. Ryan, was appointed United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin. In 2018, while filming a segment for the PBS series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Ryan learned that his DNA results included 3 percent Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

Ryan attended St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School in Janesville, then attended Joseph A. Craig High School, where he was elected president of his junior class, and thus became prom king. As class president Ryan was a representative of the student body on the school board. Following his second year, Ryan took a job working the grill at McDonald&#x27;s. He was on his high school&#x27;s ski, track, and varsity soccer teams and played basketball in a Catholic recreational league. He participated in several academic and social clubs including the Model United Nations. Ryan and his family often went on hiking and skiing trips to the Colorado Rocky Mountains.

Although Ryan&#x27;s father was not a lifelong heavy drinker, staying sober for nearly twenty years after his first stint in rehabilitation, he had become an alcoholic by the time Ryan was a teenager. Ryan later commented on his relationship with his father, whom he revered as a young child, stating that &quot;[alcohol] made him more distant, irritable and stressed ... whiskey had washed away some of the best parts of the man I knew.&quot; When he was 16, Ryan found his 55-year-old father lying dead in bed of a heart attack, something Ryan later partially attributed to heavy alcohol consumption. Following the death of his father, Ryan&#x27;s grandmother moved in with the family. As she had Alzheimer&#x27;s, Ryan helped care for her while his mother commuted to college in Madison, Wisconsin. From the time of his father&#x27;s death until his 18th birthday, Ryan received Social Security survivors benefits which were saved for his college education. His mother later married widower Bruce Douglas.

Ryan has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics and political science from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he became interested in the writings of Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and Milton Friedman. He often visited the office of libertarian professor Richard Hart to discuss the theories of these economists and of Ayn Rand. Hart introduced Ryan to &quot;National Review&quot;, and with Hart&#x27;s recommendation Ryan began an internship in the D.C. office of Wisconsin U.S. Senator Bob Kasten, where he worked with Kasten&#x27;s foreign affairs adviser.

Ryan attended the Washington Semester program at American University. He worked summers as a salesman for Oscar Mayer and once got to drive the Wienermobile. Ryan was a member of the College Republicans, and volunteered for the congressional campaign of John Boehner. He was a member of the Delta Tau Delta social fraternity.

== Early career ==
Betty Ryan reportedly urged her son to accept a congressional position as a legislative aide in Senator Kasten&#x27;s office, which he did after graduating in 1992. In his early years working on Capitol Hill, Ryan supplemented his income by working as a waiter, as a fitness trainer, and at other jobs.

A few months after Kasten lost to Democrat Russ Feingold in the 1992 election, Ryan became a speechwriter for Empower America (which later became FreedomWorks), a conservative advocacy group founded by Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and William Bennett.

Ryan later worked as a speechwriter for Kemp, the Republican vice presidential candidate in the 1996 United States presidential election. Kemp became Ryan&#x27;s mentor, and Ryan has said he had a &quot;huge influence&quot;.

In 1995, Ryan became the legislative director for then-U.S. Congressman Sam Brownback of Kansas. In 1997 he returned to Wisconsin and worked for a year as a marketing consultant for the construction company Ryan Incorporated Central, owned by his relatives.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

Ryan was first elected to the House in 1998, winning the 1st District seat of Republican Mark Neumann, a two-term incumbent who had vacated his seat to make an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate. 28-year-old Ryan won the Republican primary over 29-year-old pianist Michael J. Logan of Twin Lakes, and the general election against Democrat Lydia Spottswood. This made him the second-youngest member of the House.

Reelected eight times, Ryan never received less than 55 percent of the vote in a congressional election. He defeated Democratic challenger Jeffrey C. Thomas in the 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006 elections. In the 2008 election, Ryan defeated Democrat Marge Krupp.

In the 2010 general election, he defeated Democrat John Heckenlively and Libertarian Joseph Kexel. In 2012, under Wisconsin election law, Ryan was allowed to run concurrently for vice president and for Congress and was not allowed to remove his name from the Congressional ballot after being nominated for the vice presidency. He faced Democratic nominee Rob Zerban. As of July 25, 2012, Ryan had over $5.4 million in his congressional campaign account, more than any other House member. He was reelected with 55 percent of his district&#x27;s vote and 44 percent of the vote in his hometown, Janesville.

Zerban again challenged Ryan in the 2014 House election. Ryan won with 63 percent of his district&#x27;s vote.

In the 2016 Republican primary election, Ryan faced businessman Paul Nehlen, who had been endorsed by Sarah Palin. Because of Nehlen&#x27;s support for Trump, Trump publicly thanked him on Twitter and later told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Nehlen was &quot;running a very good campaign&quot;, even though he did not endorse him. On August 5, 2016, Trump endorsed Ryan&#x27;s re-election after pressure from fellow Republican leaders. In the primary election on August 9, 2016, Ryan overwhelmingly defeated Nehlen, taking over 84 percent of the vote. In the November general election, Ryan faced Democrat Rebecca Solen and won with 65 percent of his district&#x27;s vote.

Committee assignments

As Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ryan was not a chair or a member of any committee. Prior to his speakership, Ryan held the following assignments:
* Committee on Ways and Means (Chairman)
** Subcommittee on Health

Caucus memberships

* House Republican Caucus
* Caucus of House Conservatives Republican Study Committee
*United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
* Middle East Economic Partnership Caucus
* Prayer Caucus
* Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus (Co-Chair)
*Congressional Western Caucus

=== Pre-Speaker congressional tenure (1999–2015) ===

Ryan became the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee in 2007 and became chairman of the committee in 2011 after Republicans took control of the House. That same year, he was selected to deliver the Republican response to the State of the Union address. As of August 2012, Ryan had been the primary sponsor of more than 70 bills or amendments, and only two of those bills had become law. One, passed in July 2000, renamed a post office in Ryan&#x27;s district; the other, passed in December 2008, lowered the excise tax on arrow shafts. As of August 2012, Ryan had also co-sponsored 975 bills, of which 176 had passed; 22% of these bills were originally sponsored by a Democrat.

Ryan was a &quot;reliable supporter of the [George W. Bush] administration&#x27;s foreign policy priorities&quot; who voted for the 2002 Iraq Resolution, authorizing the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

In 2010, Ryan was a member of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Bowles-Simpson Commission), which was tasked with developing a plan to reduce the federal deficit. He voted against the final report of the commission. In 2012, Ryan accused the nation&#x27;s top military leaders of using &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot; to remain under budget limits passed by Congress. Ryan later said that he misspoke on the issue and called General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to apologize for his comments.

==2012 vice presidential campaign==

Dan Balz of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Ryan was promoted as a candidate for vice president &quot;by major elements of the conservative opinion makers, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial page, the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; and the editor of &quot;National Review&quot;&quot;.

On August 11, 2012, the Romney campaign announced Ryan as its choice for Vice President through its &quot;Mitt&#x27;s VP&quot; mobile app. It was reported that Romney had offered the position to Ryan on August 1, 2012, the day after returning from a foreign policy trip to the United Kingdom, Poland, and Israel. On August 11, 2012, Ryan formally accepted Romney&#x27;s invitation to join his campaign as his running mate, in front of the USS &quot;Wisconsin&quot; in Norfolk. Ryan is the first individual from Wisconsin as well as the first member of Generation X to run on a major party&#x27;s national ticket.

Also in August 2012, the Associated Press published a story saying that while the Tea Party movement had wanted a nominee other than Romney, it had gotten &quot;one of its ideological heroes&quot; in the vice presidential slot. According to the article, Ryan supports the Tea Party&#x27;s belief in &quot;individual rights, distrust of big government and an allegorical embrace of the Founding Fathers&quot;.

According to a statistical-historical analysis conducted by Nate Silver, &quot;Ryan is the most conservative Republican member of Congress to be picked for the vice-presidential slot since at least 1900&quot; and &quot;is also more conservative than any Democratic nominee [for vice president who previously served in the Congress] was liberal, meaning that he is the furthest from the center&quot; of any vice presidential candidate chosen from Congress since the turn of the 20th century.

Political scientist Eric Schickler commented that while Ryan &quot;may well be the most conservative vice presidential nominee in decades,&quot; the NOMINATE methodology &quot;is not suited to making claims about the relative liberalism or conservatism of politicians&quot; over a long time span. A &quot;USA Today&quot;/Gallup poll found that 39% thought Ryan was an &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;pretty good&quot; vice presidential choice, compared to 42% who felt he was a &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; choice.

Ryan formally accepted his nomination at the 2012 Republican National Convention on August 29, 2012. In his acceptance speech, he promoted Mitt Romney as the presidential candidate, supported repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), said that he and Romney had a plan to generate 12 million new jobs over the ensuing four years, and promoted founding principles as a solution: &quot;We will not duck the tough issues—we will lead. We will not spend four years blaming others—we will take responsibility. We will not try to replace our founding principles, we will reapply our founding principles.&quot;

The speech was well received by the convention audience and praised for being well-delivered. Some fact-checkers purported that there were important factual omissions and that he presented details out of context. Conservative media (including Jennifer Rubin of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Investor&#x27;s Business Daily&quot;, and Fox News) disputed some of the fact-checkers&#x27; findings. Of 33 of Ryan&#x27;s statements which Politifact.com suspected of being false or misleading, it rated 10.5% as True, 18% as Mostly True, 21% as Half True, 36% as Mostly False, 9% as False, and 6% as Pants on Fire. On October 11, 2012, Ryan debated his Democratic counterpart, incumbent Vice President Joe Biden, in the only vice presidential debate of the 2012 election cycle.

Romney and Ryan lost the 2012 presidential election, but Ryan retained his seat in the House of Representatives.

==Speaker of the House==
=== 114th Congress ===


On September 25, 2015, John Boehner formally announced to House Republicans his intention to resign from the speakership and the House. Among those interested in the post, Kevin McCarthy—who had wide support among Republicans, including Boehner, and Ryan, who was set to officially nominate him—was considered the presumptive favorite. His candidacy was opposed by conservative House Republicans of the Freedom Caucus, and when it became clear that caucus members would not support his candidacy, McCarthy withdrew his name from consideration on October 8. This led many Republicans to turn to Ryan as a compromise candidate. The push included a plea from Boehner, who reportedly told Ryan that he was the only person who could unite the House Republicans at a time of turmoil. Ryan released a statement that said, &quot;While I am grateful for the encouragement I&#x27;ve received, I will not be a candidate.&quot; The next day however, close aides of Ryan&#x27;s confirmed that Ryan had re-evaluated the situation, and was considering the possibility of a run.

Ryan confirmed on October 22, that he would seek the speakership after receiving the endorsements of two factions of House Republicans, including the conservative Freedom Caucus. Ryan, upon confirming his bid for the speakership, stated, &quot;I never thought I&#x27;d be speaker. But I pledged to you that if I could be a unifying figure, then I would serve – I would go all in. After talking with so many of you, and hearing your words of encouragement, I believe we are ready to move forward as one, united team. And I am ready and eager to be our speaker.&quot;

On October 29, Ryan was elected Speaker, receiving 236 votes, an absolute majority of the 435-member chamber. Democrat Nancy Pelosi received 184 votes, with 12 more going to others. After the vote Ryan delivered his first remarks as speaker-elect and was sworn in by John Conyers, the dean of the House, becoming, at age , the youngest person elected as speaker since James G. Blaine (age ) in 1869. Later, he named lobbyist John David Hoppe as his chief of staff.

Ryan became the leader of the House Republicans upon becoming Speaker. However, by tradition, he largely stopped taking part in debate and made only a few votes from the floor. He was also not a member of any committees.

=== 2016 presidential election ===

After Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential election on May 4, 2016, Ryan was hesitant to endorse him, stating on May 5 that he was &quot;not ready&quot;. Ryan and Trump met in private on May 12, releasing a joint statement afterward, acknowledging their differences but stating &quot;we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground.&quot; On June 2, Ryan announced his support for Trump in an op-ed in &quot;The Janesville Gazette&quot;.

The following day, June 3, amid Trump&#x27;s criticism of Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, Ryan said Trump&#x27;s critique &quot;just was out of left field for my mind,&quot; and voiced disagreement with him. On June 7, Ryan disavowed Trump&#x27;s comments about Curiel because he believed they were &quot;the textbook definition of a racist comment&quot;. Nevertheless, Ryan continued to endorse Trump, believing that more Republican policies will be enacted under Donald Trump than presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. On June 15, after Kevin McCarthy stated during a conversation among Republicans, &quot;There&#x27;s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump. Swear to God&quot;, Ryan interjected, &quot;No leaks. This is how we know we&#x27;re a real family here.&quot;

On July 5, after FBI Director James Comey advocated against pressing charges against Clinton for her email scandal, Ryan said Comey&#x27;s decision &quot;defies explanation&quot; and stated that &quot;[d]eclining to prosecute Secretary Clinton for recklessly mishandling and transmitting national security information will set a terrible precedent.&quot;

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Ryan suggested that candidate Trump should release his tax returns.
In October 2016, following the Donald Trump &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; controversy, Ryan disinvited Trump from a scheduled campaign rally, and announced that he would no longer defend or support Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign but would focus instead on Congressional races. He also freed down-ticket congress members to use their own judgment about Trump, saying &quot;you all need to do what&#x27;s best for you and your district.&quot; Trump then went on to attack Ryan, accusing him and other &quot;disloyal&quot; Republicans of deliberately undermining his candidacy as part of &quot;a whole sinister deal&quot;.

=== 115th Congress ===
Two months after the 2016 elections, Ryan was re-elected Speaker of the House on January 3, 2017, the opening day of the 115th Congress. He received 239 votes to House Democratic Leader Pelosi&#x27;s 189 votes (with 5 more going to others).

On February 7, 2017, Ryan told reporters a replacement for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would be introduced &quot;this year&quot; amid speculation Donald Trump would not act toward doing so until the following year. On March 9, Ryan gave a 30-minute lecture explaining the proposed replacement for the ACA, titled the American Health Care Act (AHCA). On March 30, Ryan said that he did not intend to work with Democrats on repealing and replacing the ACA, reasoning their involvement would lead to &quot;government running health care.&quot; On April 4, Ryan confirmed renewed discussions of an ACA replacement, but warned that a replacement was in the &quot;conceptual&quot; stages of its development. On May 4, the House narrowly voted for the AHCA to repeal the ACA. On May 9, Ryan said that &quot;a month or two&quot; would pass before the Senate would pass its own ACA repeal and replacement legislation. The Senate created several of its own versions of the act but was unable to pass any of them.

In May 2017, Ryan said Congress&#x27; goal was &quot;calendared 2017 for tax reform&quot; and reported progress was being made in doing so. In December 2017, both houses of Congress passed a $1.5 trillion tax bill called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law on December 22. The tax law is projected to add an additional $1.5 trillion to the national debt over a decade, but the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation also estimated that the GDP level on average would be 0.7% higher during the same period. In the weeks leading up to his retirement announcement, Ryan also championed a $1.3 trillion government-wide spending bill that boosted military spending significantly. &quot;Politico&quot; noted that Ryan &quot;clamored for austerity when he&#x27;s been in the minority, trashing Democrats as profligate budget-busters, but he&#x27;s happily busted budgets in the majority.&quot;

In June 2017, Ryan expressed support for strong sanctions on Russia in response to Russian interference in the 2016 elections and its annexation of the Crimea, saying that Russia&#x27;s actions were &quot;unacceptable&quot;. He urged Special Counsel Robert Mueller and Congressional oversight committees to &quot;do their jobs so that we can get to the bottom of all of this.&quot; In July Congress passed a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia and giving Congress the power to overrule White House attempts to roll back sanctions. Both houses passed the bill with veto-proof majorities (98–2 in the Senate, 419–3 in the House), so Trump reluctantly signed it into law on August 2, 2017.

Ryan provided political cover for Devin Nunes, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, who many characterized as a source of the dysfunction in the committee as it investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Nunes accused the Obama administration of improperly &quot;unmasking&quot; the identities of Trump associates (which led Nunes&#x27; temporary recusal from the committee&#x27;s Russia investigation), accused the FBI of misconduct, leaked the text messages of Senator Mark Warner (in an effort to misleadingly suggest impropriety on his behalf), and threatened to impeach FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The House Intelligence Committee was one of few so-called &quot;select&quot; committees in Congress, which meant that it was up to Ryan to decide the chairman of the committee.

Despite having favored comprehensive immigration earlier in his congressional career, Speaker Ryan prevented immigration legislation from being advanced in the House. When President Trump ended Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) – which granted temporary stay for undocumented immigrants brought into the United States as minors – Ryan said DACA recipients should &quot;rest easy&quot; because Congress would solve the problem for them, but Ryan backed no bills to protect DACA recipients.

An article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Ryan&#x27;s relationship with President Trump as &quot;friendly, if occasionally uneasy,&quot; adding that &quot;Ryan did little to check the president or encourage oversight of his administration.&quot; Ryan supported Trump&#x27;s firing of FBI Director James Comey, and did not support legislation to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Ryan said that legislation to protect Mueller&#x27;s investigation was not &quot;necessary&quot;.

On April 11, 2018, Ryan announced that he would not run for re-election in November, saying, &quot;I like to think I&#x27;ve done my part, my little part in history to set us on a better course.&quot; In response, Trump tweeted, &quot;Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question.&quot;

In May 2018, Ryan led the House in passing the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, which partially repealed the Dodd-Frank Act. It was signed into law by President Trump a few days later.

After Republicans lost control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, Ryan suggested that there were irregularities about the election results in California. Ryan said that California&#x27;s election system was &quot;bizarre&quot;, &quot;defies logic&quot; and that &quot;there are a lot of races there we should have won.&quot; After Ryan&#x27;s remarks were reported on, Ryan&#x27;s spokesperson said &quot;The Speaker did not and does not dispute the results&quot;.

=== Assessment of Speaker tenure ===
Following Ryan&#x27;s retirement announcement, an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that Ryan was &quot;leav[ing] behind a legacy of dramatically expanded government spending and immense deficits, a GOP president unchecked, a broken immigration system, and a party that&#x27;s fast abandoning the free-trade principles that he himself championed.&quot; According to the Associated Press, Ryan &quot;achieved one of his career goals: rewriting the tax code&quot;; however, &quot;on his other defining aim—balancing the budget and cutting back benefit programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid—Ryan has utterly failed&quot;.

===Constituent services===
In fiscal year 2008, Ryan garnered $5.4 million in congressional earmarks, including $3.28 million for bus service in Wisconsin, $1.38 million for the Ice Age Trail, and $735,000 for the Janesville transit system. In 2009, he successfully advocated with the Department of Energy for stimulus funds for energy initiatives in his district.

Other home district projects he has supported include a runway extension at the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport, an environmental study of the Kenosha Harbor, firefighting equipment for Janesville, road projects in Wisconsin, and commuter rail and streetcar projects in Kenosha. In 2008, Ryan pledged to stop seeking earmarks. Prior to that he had sought earmarks less often than other representatives. Taxpayers for Common Sense records show no earmarks supported by Ryan for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. In 2012, Ryan supported a request for $3.8 million from the Department of Transportation for a new transit center in Janesville, which city officials received in July.

Ryan was an active member of a task force established by Wisconsin governor Jim Doyle that tried unsuccessfully to persuade General Motors to keep its assembly plant in Janesville open. He made personal contact with GM executives to try to convince them to save or retool the plant, offering GM hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer-funded incentives. Following the closure of factories in Janesville and Kenosha, constituents expressed dissatisfaction with Ryan&#x27;s voting history. During the 2011 Congressional summer break, Ryan held town hall meetings by telephone with constituents. The only public meetings Ryan attended in his district required an admission fee of at least $15.

In August 2011, constituents in Kenosha and Racine protested when Ryan would not meet with them about economic and employment issues, after weeks of emailed requests from them. His Kenosha office locked its doors and filed a complaint with the police, who told the protesters that they were not allowed in Ryan&#x27;s office.

Ryan maintained a mobile office to serve constituents in outlying areas.

==Congressional Leadership Fund==

The Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a Super PAC, has been closely linked and aligned with Ryan. Ryan has directed major GOP donors towards the CLF.

==Political positions==

Ryan&#x27;s political positions were generally conservative, with a focus on fiscal policy. Ryan &quot;played a central role in nearly all&quot; the policy debates of the period 2010–2012. In 2012, Ryan voted against the Simpson–Bowles commission proposal to reduce the deficit, because the proposal raised taxes and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. While he was a self-proclaimed deficit hawk, Ryan&#x27;s tenure of Speaker of the House saw a major expansion in government spending and a ballooning of deficits despite unified Republican control of Congress and the White House, no recession and no new foreign conflict.

Ryan subscribed to supply-side economics and supported tax cuts including eliminating the capital gains tax, the corporate income tax, the estate tax, and the Alternative Minimum Tax. Ryan supports deregulation, including the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During the economic recovery from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other financial institutions, and the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation. In 2018 as House Speaker, Ryan helped pass the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act that repealed large parts of Dodd-Frank.

In 2016, Ryan rolled out a set of anti-poverty proposals that &quot;seek to expand work requirements for those receiving federal benefits, to give states and local jurisdictions a greater role in administering those benefits, to better measure the results of federal programs for the poor, and to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse.&quot; Ryan believes federal poverty reduction programs are ineffective and he supports cuts to welfare, child care, Pell Grants, food stamps, and other federal assistance programs. Ryan supports block granting Medicaid to the states and the privatization of social security and Medicare. Ryan supported the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit and opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as &quot;Obamacare.&quot; Ryan supported the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), the 2017 House Republican plan to repeal and replace the ACA. In 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Ryan was &quot;his party&#x27;s most forceful spokesman for cutting entitlement spending.&quot;

Ryan&#x27;s non-fiscal policy positions were subject to additional national attention with his 2012 candidacy for vice president. Ryan is pro-life and opposes abortion rights. Ryan opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which provides that the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination resets with each new paycheck affected by that discriminatory action. In 2012, Ryan supported civil unions and opposed same-sex marriage.

Ryan supported school vouchers, and supported the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 and its repeal the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015. Ryan is unsure, and believes climate scientists are unsure, of the impact of human activity on climate change. Ryan supported tax incentives for the petroleum industry and opposed them for renewable energy. Ryan supported gun rights and opposed stricter gun control. Ryan supported the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Ryan condemned Barack Obama&#x27;s decision not to block a UN resolution criticizing Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as &quot;absolutely shameful&quot;. Ryan supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. He stated: &quot;Jerusalem has been, and always will be, the eternal, undivided capital of the State of Israel.&quot;

Following the 2018 Russia–United States summit, in which Donald Trump stated that he believed Russian government did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Ryan confirmed his belief that Russian government interfered and advocated for more economic sanctions against Russia for the interference.

Ryan supported U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war and used his power to block a House vote on the war in Yemen.

In a 2022 interview, Ryan described himself as a &quot;Never-Again Trumper.&quot; While he was &quot;proud of the accomplishments [during the Trump administration]&quot;, Ryan highlighted how under Trump, the Republican Party lost elections in 2018, 2020, and 2022, and said that the party should thus distance itself from Trump. A year later, Ryan would deride Trump as a &quot;populist, authoritarian narcissist&quot; and &quot;not a conservative.&quot; In June 2024, Ryan stated he would not vote for Trump in the 2024 presidential election, instead planning to write-in another candidate because of Trump&#x27;s lack of &quot;character.&quot; Prior to the Republican primaries, Ryan privately encouraged Congressman Mike Gallagher to support Nikki Haley&#x27;s presidential campaign.

===History with Objectivism===
At a 2005 Washington, D.C., gathering celebrating the 100th anniversary of Ayn Rand&#x27;s birth, Ryan credited Rand with having inspired him to get involved in politics. In a speech that same year at The Atlas Society, he said he grew up reading Rand, and that her books taught him about his value system and beliefs. Ryan required staffers and interns in his congressional office to read Rand, and gave copies of her novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; as gifts to his staff for Christmas. In his Atlas Society speech, he also described Social Security as a &quot;socialist-based system&quot;.

In 2009, Ryan said, &quot;What&#x27;s unique about what&#x27;s happening today in government, in the world, in America, is that it&#x27;s as if we&#x27;re living in an Ayn Rand novel right now. I think Ayn Rand did the best job of anybody to build a moral case of capitalism, and that morality of capitalism is under assault.&quot;

In April 2012, after receiving criticism from Georgetown University faculty members on his budget plan, Ryan rejected Rand&#x27;s philosophy of Objectivism as atheistic, saying it &quot;reduces human interactions down to mere contracts&quot;. He also called the reports of his adherence to Rand&#x27;s views an &quot;urban legend&quot; and stated that he was instead deeply influenced by his Catholic faith and by Thomas Aquinas.

==Electoral history==








== Post-congressional life ==
In March 2019, Ryan joined the board of directors of Fox Corporation, the owner of Fox News Channel and the Fox broadcast network. In August 2019, he joined the board of SHINE Medical Technologies. He later joined the faculty of the University of Notre Dame as a professor of practice for the 2019–20 academic year as a guest lecturer in political science and economics. In April 2019, Ryan was nominated as the delegation leader to represent President Trump to visit Taipei. With Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, he attended the 40th-anniversary ceremony of the Taiwan Relations Act. In October 2019, Ryan launched a non-profit called American Idea Foundation.

In October 2020, Ryan joined the public relations and advisory company Teneo as a senior advisor. In February 2021 he became a partner in the Boston private equity investment firm Solamere Capital.

On May 17, 2023, Ryan unveiled his official portrait at the U.S. Capitol during a ceremony in Statuary Hall. During his speech, he said, &quot;Only in America would it be possible for a kid from Janesville to go from an intern to the Speaker of the House&quot;.

==Personal life==

In December 2000, Ryan married Janna Christine Little who is a tax attorney. Janna Ryan is a native of Madill, Oklahoma, and a graduate of both Wellesley College and George Washington University Law School. The Ryans live in the Courthouse Hill Historic District of Janesville, Wisconsin. They have three children: Elizabeth &quot;Liza&quot; Anne, Charles Wilson, and Samuel Lowery. Ryan is a member of St. John Vianney Catholic Church in Janesville.

Janna is a cousin of former Democratic Representative Dan Boren (D-OK). She is also a granddaughter of Reuel Little, who helped found the American Party to support the 1968 presidential campaign of George Wallace. Through his marriage, Ryan is related to Supreme Court justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

During a 2012 radio interview, Ryan claimed he had once run a marathon in under three hours; he later said he forgot his actual time and was just trying to give what he thought was a normal time. His one official marathon time is recorded as slightly over four hours.

<doc id="409053" wikidata="Q799577" url="?curid=409053" title="Pakistan Muslim League (N)">
<text>The Pakistan Muslim League (N) abbreviated as PML (N), () is a centre-right, conservative political party in Pakistan. It is currently the third-largest party in the Senate and the largest in the National Assembly. The party was founded in 1993, when a number of prominent conservative politicians in the country joined hands after the dissolution of Islamic Democratic Alliance, under the leadership of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The party&#x27;s platform is generally conservative, which involves supporting free markets, deregulation, lower taxes and private ownership. Although the party initially supported social conservatism, in recent years, the party&#x27;s political ideology and platform has become more liberally conservative. Alongside the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP), it is one of the three major political parties of the country.

One of several continuing factions of the original Muslim League, the seeds of the party were sown following the 1985 elections when the Prime Minister of Pakistan Muhammad Khan Junejo organised the supporters of President Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s dictatorship into a single party, known as the Pakistan Muslim League. After President Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s death in 1988, under the leadership of Fida Mohammad Khan, a large faction split away from the Junejo-led Pakistan Muslim League, and formed a conservative alliance with various right-wing and Islamist political parties, called the Islamic Democratic Alliance. The alliance formed a government in 1990 under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif. In 1993, the alliance dissolved and the party assumed its current shape, branding itself as the &quot;Nawaz&quot; faction of the Pakistan Muslim League, in contrast to the &quot;Junejo&quot; faction. Members were accused of using Islamist populist rhetoric. 

After its foundation, the PML-N, along with the People&#x27;s Party, dominated the two-party political system of Pakistan. However, after the 1999 coup, the party was eclipsed by its own splinter faction, the Musharraf-backed Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid), for almost a decade. PML-N regained popularity in the 2008 general elections, when it was elected as the principal opposition party. It returned to power following the elections of 2013, with Sharif elected as the prime minister for an unprecedented third term. The party, however, faced a major setback following the disqualification of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017. The situation was worsened when Sharif and his daughter Maryam were sentenced to imprisonment on charges of corruption; however, their respective sentences were later suspended.

The party lost both the center and provincial government of its stronghold Punjab, to PTI in the 2018 elections. In 2024, General Elections, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz emerged as the largest party in Punjab with 193 members in the Provincial Assembly, and also largest in the Center. Maryam Nawaz (daughter of Former PM Nawaz Sharif) became the first female Chief Minister of Punjab.

==History==
===Breakaway from the original PML===
Upon the creation of Pakistan and departure of the British Crown in 1947, the All-India Muslim League (AIML) became the Muslim League, which was now led by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. After the assassination of Prime Minister Ali Khan, the Muslim League struggled to revive itself, eventually losing control of East Pakistan in legislative elections to the Left Front. Internal disagreement over the party&#x27;s direction, lack of a political program, motivation for public reforms, and inadequate administrative preparations and mismanagement all led to the public decline of the party. With the Socialist Party, the Muslim League struggled for its survival while facing the Republican Party and Awami League. The martial law imposed in 1958 eventually outlawed all political parties in the country.

The foundation and ground base of the PML-N lies with the Pakistan Muslim League, which was founded in 1962 as an enriched conservative project derived from the defunct Muslim League. The PML was presided over by Fatima Jinnah, who actively participated in presidential elections held in 1965 against Muhammad Ayub Khan. After Fatima Jinnah&#x27;s death, the PML was led by Nurul Amin, a Bengali leader, who deepened its role in West Pakistan.

On a nationalist and conservative platform, the party engaged in political campaigns against the leftist Pakistan People&#x27;s Party and the Bengali nationalist party, the Awami League, in the general elections held in 1970. It managed to secure only two electoral seats in the East Pakistan parliament and only ten in the National Assembly of Pakistan. In spite of its limited mandate, Nurul Amin became the prime minister and vice-president of Pakistan – the only figure to have been appointed as vice-president. The PML government was short-lived and soon its government fell in the aftermath of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The PML-N is ideologically close to the military and holds common beliefs on national security.

The list below shows the well-known breakaway factions and their relationships with the military, although many minor factions have existed throughout Pakistani history:

===Electoral history===

The Pakistan Muslim League went into a political abyss after the death of Nurul Amin and during the PPP government of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. It made a strong comeback in response to Bhutto&#x27;s nationalisation program in the 1970s. Influential young activists, including Nawaz Sharif, Javed Hashmi, Zafar-ul-Haq, and Shujaat Hussain, ascended as the leaders of the party and started their political career through the Muslim League.

The party became an integral part of the nine-party alliance, PNA, against the PPP, and campaigned against the PPP in the 1977 general elections. They campaigned on a right-wing platform and raised conservative slogans in the 1977 general elections. The PML, including Sharif and Hussain, were a conglomerate of diverse views and had provided large capital for the Muslim League&#x27;s financial expenses. It was at this time that the party was revived and joined the anti-Bhutto PNA with Pir Pagara, an influential Sindhi conservative figure, as its elected president.

After the martial law of 1977, the party reassessed itself and saw the rise of the powerful oligarch bloc led by Zahoor Illahi, who was the main PML leader. After the 1984 referendum, President Zia-ul-Haq had become the country&#x27;s elected president. During the 1985 general election, a new PML-N emerged on the country&#x27;s political scene. The party had supported the presidency of Zia-ul-Haq and won his support to appoint Mohammad Khan Junejo to the office of Prime Minister. Nawaz Sharif had won the favour and support of President Zia-ul-Haq, who approved his appointment as Chief Minister of Punjab Province in 1985.

====1988 general elections====

The modern history of the party began during the 1988 parliamentary elections, when the Pakistan Muslim League, led by former prime minister Mohammed Khan Junejo, split into two factions: one was led by Fida Mohammad Khan and Nawaz Sharif, the then chief minister of Punjab Province, and the other by Junejo (who later founded the Pakistan Muslim League (F)).

In 1988, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) was founded and established by Fida Mohammad Khan, an original Pakistan Movement activist, who became the party&#x27;s founding president, whilst Nawaz Sharif became its first secretary-general. The party is not the original Muslim League, but is accepted as its continuing legal successor.

At the time of the 1988 elections, the PML was part of the eight-party Islamic Democratic Alliance (IDA), which had contained the right-wing conservative mass as one entity against the left-wing circles, led by the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP). The general elections of 1988 marked the emergence of the Pakistan People’s Party&#x27;s as the single largest political party, with its election to 94 of 237 seats in the state parliament. The IDA occupied 55 seats, but an influential leader, Nawaz Sharif, chose to serve the Chief Minister of Punjab Province. With Benazir Bhutto elevated to the post Prime Minister of Pakistan, the IDA nominated Abdul Wali Khan as a compromise candidate for opposition leader in the state parliament. Within 20 months, tales of bad governance and corruption plagued the Pakistan People’s Party&#x27;s government. Finally, in 1990, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan charged the PPP government with corruption and lack of governance and dismissed the National Assembly and the first Bhutto government.

====1990 general elections====

The PML-N was still part of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IDA) and participated, under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, in the 1990 general elections. The IDA competed against the leftist alliance, known as the People&#x27;s Democratic Alliance (PDA), which had contained the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party and the &quot;TeI&quot;. The elections resulted in the victory of IDA, with Nawaz Sharif becoming prime minister. Through IDA, the conservative forces under Sharif had a chance to form a national government for the first time in the history of Pakistan. With Sharif taking office, his ascendancy also marked a transition in the political culture of Pakistan – a power shift from control by the traditional feudal aristocracy to the growing class of modern and moderate entrepreneurs. For the first time, Sharif launched privatisation and economic liberalisation policy measures, and his economic team actually implemented some of the serious economic liberalisation and privatisation measures previous governments had merely talked about.

Election results also showed liberals, the MQM, emerging as the third major party with 15 seats. For the first time in the history of the country, Sharif allowed foreign money exchange to be transacted through private money changers. While internationally acclaimed, his policies were condemned by the PPP. Benazir Bhutto mounted pressure on President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who dismissed the IDA government on 18 April 1993. The PML-N appealed to the Supreme Court, which then restored Sharif&#x27;s government on 26 May. The country&#x27;s armed forces and the military leadership attempted to negotiate with Sharif and get him to step down. This culminated in the resignation of Nawaz Sharif, and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan was also removed from office.

====1993 elections and opposition====

The PML-N gained national prominence in the 1993 parliamentary elections and occupied 73 seats in the state parliament. The party asserted its role as opposition to the Pakistan People’s Party. The PML-N charged Benazir Bhutto with corruption, stagnation, and endangering national security. The PPP also suffered due to internal factions, one of which was led by Murtaza Bhutto. The controversial murder of Murtaza Bhutto by Sindh Police and the pressure on MQM further weakened Benazir Bhutto. The PML-N and Sharif himself were shocked when they learned the news of Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s dismissal. An ironic aspect of this dismissal was that it was prompted by the then-President Farooq Leghari, a trusted lieutenant of Benazir, who sent her to the presidency as a safeguard for the PPP&#x27;s government after the office was vacated by Ghulam Ishaq Khan. During that movement, Nawaz Sharif travelled through the length and breadth of Pakistan. He also embarked on a train march from Lahore to Peshawar as part of his campaign to oust Benazir.

During this time, the party was among the closest to the civil bureaucracy and the Pakistan Armed Forces, and had close ties and influence in the Pakistan Armed Forces&#x27; appointments as well as their military strategies.

====1997 elections and power politics====
The Pakistan Muslim League (N) struck its remarkable, biggest, and most notable achievement in the 1997 parliamentary elections, held on 3 February 1997. It secured a two-thirds majority in the Pakistan Parliament, the only political party to have gained a two-thirds majority since the country&#x27;s independence in 1947. During this time, the PML-N was the largest conservative party, with its members occupying 137 seats out of 207, roughly 66.2%. In 1997, the party secured its win with an overwhelming mandate, with only a small opposition. On 18 February 1997, when Nawaz Sharif obtained a vote of confidence, the Pakistan Muslim League assumed the government of Pakistan. Nawaz Sharif allowed Benazir Bhutto to hold the office of Leader of the Opposition, though the PML-N held control of the state parliament. The PML-N government passed the Thirteenth and the Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of Pakistan to stabilize its mandate and strengthen its position.

In 1998, the law and order situation came under the PML-N&#x27;s control and economic recovery was also secured. A number of constitutional amendments were made to make the country a parliamentary democracy. In May 1998, the PML-N government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered six nuclear tests, in response to Indian nuclear tests. The tests were extremely popular and PML-N&#x27;s image and prestige rose to a record level at home. However, in 1998, the PML-N government effectively dismissed general Jehangir Karamat (see Dismissal of General Jehangir Karamat), which ruined its public ratings, but marked a perception of the civilian control of the military. This type of power politics and the repeated dismissals of military leaders soured the party&#x27;s relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces and its public ratings gradually went down.

Despite its heavy public mandate, serious disagreements appeared within the party. Finally, the 1999 coup d&#x27;état ended the PML-N&#x27;s government. Controversially, in 1999, the party was significantly divided, further affecting Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s trial in military court. No massive protests were held by the party; its leaders remained silent and remained supportive towards the military action against Nawaz Sharif. In 2001, the party was further divided by factionalism. Dissenters formed the Pakistan Muslim League, later called Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) (or PML-Q), which became allies of then president Pervez Musharraf. In 2001, the Muslim League (Nawaz) formally adopted the name of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), also known as PML(N).

====2002 general elections====
As a result of the Kargil War with India, the PML-N government had generated frustration within the party and a secret splinter group inside the party united on a one-point agenda with all the opposition parties in 1999 to remove Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from office. This resulted in a military coup d&#x27;état. The Supreme Court validated the coup and gave General Pervez Musharraf three years to hold general elections. After deposing Sharif&#x27;s government, the party split into several groups and its size shrunk as many of its members decided to defect to the splinter political bloc. Many of its most influential members, sponsors, and financiers came to defect to the new group that was sympathetic to Pervez Musharraf. This splinter group emerged as the Pakistan Muslim League (Q), which registered itself as a political party with the Election Commission. Sharif was removed from the party&#x27;s presidency and the position was handed over to Dr. Kalsoum Nawaz, wife of Sharif. With Nawaz Sharif exiled to Saudi Arabia, the party&#x27;s presidency was handed over to Javed Hashmi, and the party began to reassert itself in the coming elections. They campaigned all over the country and competed in the 2002 general elections for the state parliament. The election polls announced the victory of the Pakistan Muslim League (Q) and the liberals, MQM, with PML-Q retaining the majority in the state parliament and brutally defeating the PML-N.

During the 2002 Pakistani general election, the PML-N performed poorly, only winning 9.4% of the popular vote and gaining seats for only 14 out of 272 elected members, the worst defeat since its inception in 1988. Hashmi was removed from the party&#x27;s presidency after his controversial remarks towards the country&#x27;s armed forces. In an indirect party election, Shahbaz Sharif was elected as the party&#x27;s new president, and the party&#x27;s leadership shifted its base to London, England. In 2006, the party signed a cooperative declaration with its rival Pakistan People&#x27;s Party to outline and promote a new democratic culture in the country. Known as the Charter of Democracy, the document was signed by Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto in London, and they announced their opposition to Musharraf and Shaukat Aziz. In the 2008 general election, the party won urban votes and dominated the provisional assembly of Punjab Province. They secured a total of 91 seats in the state parliament, just second to the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party, which won 121 seats, and the parties agreed on forming a coalition government. The PML-N called for the impeachment of President Pervez Musharraf, and successfully ousted him from the presidency and exiled him to the United States in 2008. However, before long, Nawaz Sharif announced his support for and leadership of the Lawyers&#x27; Movement to restore the suspended famed Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry in 2008. In 2011, the PML-N established a branch in Kashmir Province to participate in Kashmir&#x27;s general elections.

====2008 parliamentary election====

After returning to Pakistan, the PML-N contested the 2008 general election, demanding a restoration of the judges sacked under the emergency rule put in place by President Pervez Musharraf, and the removal of Musharraf as president. After the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, Sharif announced that the PML-N would boycott the polls, but after some time and conversations with the co-chairman of the PPP, Asif Ali Zardari, Nawaz announced that the party would run in the polls and began to rally in the Punjab areas. On 18 February 2008, after the polls were closed and the results had been announced, the PML-N gained 68 seats in the National Assembly, just behind the PPP. They announced that they would have discussions on forming a coalition with the PPP, which would get half the seats in the 342 seat Parliament. In a press conference on 19 February, Nawaz called for President Pervez Musharraf to step down. Nawaz and Zardari agreed on forming a coalition, and Nawaz announced that he and his party gave the PPP the right to choose the next Prime Minister.

On 13 May 2008, the PML-N ministers resigned from the government due to a disagreement related to the reinstatement of the judges. Nawaz said that the PML-N would support the government without participating in it. Zardari, hoping to preserve the coalition, told Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani to reject the resignations.

On 27 June 2008, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP) won three and two by-election seats respectively, in the national parliament. Polls were postponed for the sixth seat in Lahore due to Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s eligibility contest. A court ruled he was ineligible due to an old conviction, amid a government appeal in the Supreme Court, which was slated to hear the case on 30 June, thus postponing the vote in the constituency. The two parties also won 19 of 23 provincial assembly seats where by-elections were held. The results did not affect the 18 February general election results in which Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s PPP won 123 seats in the 342-seat National Assembly, and Sharif&#x27;s party came second with 91, while Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s party came a poor third, with 54 seats. Sharif&#x27;s Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) won eight provincial assembly seats, while the PPP won seven provincial seats. On 25 August 2008, Nawaz Sharif announced that Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui would be Pakistan Muslim League (N) nominee to replace Pervez Musharraf as President of Pakistan.

====2013 general elections====
During its election campaign for the 2013 general elections, the party competed against its arch-rival, the PPP, and another centrist party, the PTI. In an unofficial count, the party secured the qualified majority in the state parliament, the Punjab Assembly, and the Balochistan Assembly; it is yet the only party to have secured respectable seats and representation on provisional assemblies of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The leader of PML-N, Nawaz Sharif, won a third term as Prime Minister of Pakistan, the first time this had happened in the history of the country.

====2018 general elections====
The 2018 Pakistani general election was majorly contested between PML-N and PTI. While PML-N retained its position in central Punjab it faced major setbacks in southern and northern Punjab. It obtained 64 seats in the National Assembly of Pakistan and 165 seats in the Punjab assembly. While it does not have mentionable shares in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan Assembly. After the elections Shehbaz Sharif was elected as the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly of Pakistan, while his son Hamza Shahbaz was elected as Leader of the Opposition of Punjab (Pakistan). 
PML-N became part of the opposition alliance Pakistan Democratic Movement, successfully moved No-confidence motion against Imran Khan and removed him from office on 10 April 2022, and Shehbaz Sharif became Prime Minister of Pakistan. Subsequently, the nonconfidence movement was launched in the Provincial Assembly of Punjab on 16, April 2022, and Hamza Shahbaz became Chief Minister of Punjab.

==Structure==

The major function of the General Council Meeting (or Central Working Committee) is to elect presidents and secretaries, while it is also responsible for promoting PML-N activities. The GCM&#x27;s meetings are generally held at the Jinnah Convention Centre in Islamabad.

Nawaz Sharif was elected President of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) in 2011. The General Council Meeting raises funds and coordinates campaign strategy, and it has local committees in every province and in most large cities, counties, and legislative districts, but these have far less money and influence than the national body. The Central Secretariat and the Parliament Lodges of the Pakistan Parliament play important roles in recruiting strong state candidates.

Nawaz Sharif has been accused of corruption and involvement in smuggling large amounts of money outside the country, and he was recently revealed by the Panama Papers to have been involved in hiding money in offshore accounts and companies.

==Ideology==
===Economic policies===

The Pakistan Muslim League (N) policies include conservative liberalism, environmental conservation, and most importantly, economic liberalism. Throughout its history, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) has emphasised the role of free markets and individual achievement as the primary factors behind economic prosperity, deregulation of all segments of the economic order, and the strong base of capitalism. In 1991, the PML-N&#x27;s government established the National Highway Authority followed by inaugurating the &quot;M2 Motorways&quot; in 1997.

The Pakistan Muslim League (N) generally opposes labour union management and large-scale workers&#x27; unions. The party holds that &quot;prosperous agriculture is the backbone of national prosperity and diversification of the rural economy, by expanding non-farm rural employment, is critical for the alleviation of poverty&quot;. During its federal government, the PML-N successfully privatised the major heavy industries under its planned industrial development programme.

===Environmental policies===
In 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency was established by the PML-N government, and its Ministry of Environment was one of the most notable government offices to protect national conservation and forestry in the country. In 1997, environmental PSAs were regularly paid for by the government to enhance and promote environmental awareness among the public.

However, the ministry&#x27;s environmental policies remain a subject of ongoing controversy, often criticised for ignoring the health of the environment despite the party&#x27;s declarations. The PML-N&#x27;s provincial government in Punjab Province came under intense media, opposition, and public anger after failing to counter the 2011 dengue fever outbreak due to its apathy and the inadequacy of steps taken to enforce environmental awareness and regulations. Recently, the prestige of PML-N has suffered after the government&#x27;s Health and Environment ministries failed to properly inspect the quality of medicines, resulting in major counterfeiting and environmental crises, which put the party&#x27;s environmental and health policies in great doubt.

===Science and politics===
The Pakistan Muslim League (N) is credited for ordering and authorizing the country&#x27;s first nuclear tests (see &quot;Chagai-I&quot; and &quot;Chagai-II&quot;) amid immense international pressure. It is also responsible for establishing the Pakistan Antarctic Programme as part of its science and technology strategy. Together with their main rival, the Pakistan People’s Party, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) is also responsible for increasing Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear deterrent as well as boosting the nation&#x27;s nuclear power growth, first establishing the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant expansion as part of its nuclear policy.

===Foreign policy issues===
The party has been long advocated for broader and stronger relations with the United States, China, the United Kingdom, European Union, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, as well as India. In 1999, the party&#x27;s government successfully signed the &quot;Lahore Declaration&quot; with India.

The Pakistan Muslim League (N) remains sceptical about the country&#x27;s role in the war on terror, although it is firmly opposed to religious extremism and terrorism in all its manifestations. While it remains a strong supporter of the United States&#x27; financial and fiscal policies, it remains undecided about the military operations on its western frontier to curb militancy, with many PML-N intellectuals regarding the War on Terror as a campaign against Islam. During its previous tenure from 1997 to 1999, the PML-N government took a series of measures to control terrorist groups by establishing the Anti Terrorism Courts. The PML-N&#x27;s leadership remains an avid supporter of Indian-held Kashmir, and numerous times it had made it clear that the party will &quot;never compromise this long standing position on Kashmir dispute&quot;.

==Leaders==
== Challenges and controversies ==

===Operation Clean-up===

Nawaz Sharif, during his first tenure as prime minister of Pakistan (1990–1993), launched a military operation against his own allies in government, MQM, for allegations against the Jinnahpur conspiracy. Later, the ISPR denied any knowledge of the Jinnahpur conspiracy and separatist maps, which were highly publicized in the media prior to the operation&#x27;s launch. Thousands of MQM activists were killed, its leadership arrested, and its head, Altaf Hussain, fled to exile in the UK.

===Operation 1998===
During his second term as prime minister (1997–1999), Nawaz Sharif again launched an operation against MQM, who were again in alliance in Sharif&#x27;s government, on accusations of assassinating Hakeem Said. Due to MQM&#x27;s militant activities and sectarian killings in Karachi, Nawaz Sharif was forced to end the alliance with MQM for the benefit of the nation. An elected PMLN Sindh government in alliance with MQM was dismissed and President&#x27;s rule was imposed. The operation launched a new era of bloodshed in Karachi and many party leaders from MQM were arrested. Imran Farooq (MQM second in command at that time) was forced to flee Pakistan and took political asylum in the UK. Fasih Jugu, who was accused of assassination, was tortured to death by law enforcement officers. The operation resulted in major unrest as the PMLN government tried to nab the criminal elements ravaging the city of Karachi. This was one of the prime excuses the military conjured up for illegally ousting Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s government in 1999 through martial law.

===Plane hijacking===
In 1999, Nawaz Sharif was allegedly involved in the hijacking of a plane carrying then Chief of Army Staff Pervez Musharraf as it was about to land at Karachi airport, and the control tower ordered the plane not to land in Pakistan but India instead. However, Musharraf and his loyalists had been planning a coup for months and some versions of the story claim that Musharraf orchestrated the coup from the plane and the military didn&#x27;t allow the plane to land until Musharraf was assured that the military was in control of the airport. The military forced the courts to convict Sharif and sentence him to life imprisonment in 2000. General Musharraf had initially decided to hang Nawaz Sharif but under pressure from the President of the United States Bill Clinton and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, he decided not to go through with the plan. In 2010, The Supreme Court of Pakistan overturned Nawaz&#x27; conviction, making him eligible to run for power again.

===Allegations of corruption===
PMLN has been accused of corruption in revolutionary economic schemes such as the Yellow Cab Scheme, The National Debt Retirement Programme (NDRP), the Sasti Roti Scheme, and the Nandipur Power Project. More recently, an international newspaper published the Panama papers, naming Sharif&#x27;s sons as among people who created offshore companies. Nawaz Sharif is accused of using corruption money to grow his assets in his business ventures and Ittefaq Group. Also, Nawaz Sharif was condemned to 10 years in lockup for money laundering, including his daughter Maryam Nawaz for 7 years. On 29 September 2022, Islamabad High Court overturned the corruption conviction of Maryam Nawaz and her husband Muhammad Safdar. Maryam Nawaz is now eligible to run for election.

===Panama papers case and its implications===

The Panama Papers case was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of Pakistan that disqualified the incumbent prime minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, from holding public office for life. The Supreme Court of Pakistan was petitioned by opposition politicians Imran Khan and Sheikh Rasheed, in the aftermath of the Panama Papers leak, which uncovered links between the Sharif family and eight offshore companies. The Court ordered for a Joint Investigation Team to be formed for the inquiry into allegations of money laundering, corruption and contradictory statements made by the Sharif family. On 10 July 2017, JIT submitted a 275-page report to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The report found that Sharif, his sons and his daughter Maryam Nawaz could not justify their income nor their assets, adding that Maryam Nawaz had been proved to be a beneficial owner of Nielsen and Nescoll. The report also showed that Maryam Nawaz had falsified evidence before the Supreme Court, proven as the Calibri font used in the document did not exist at the time when documents were said to have been created. After hearing all arguments and based on evidence provided by the JIT, the Supreme Court of Pakistan announced its unanimous decision and disqualified the Prime Minister from holding public office, finding that he had been dishonest in not disclosing his employed in the Dubai-based Capital FZE company in his nomination papers.

Stemming from the JIT investigation, and based on NAB&#x27;s investigations, the court sentenced Nawaz Sharif to 10 years of imprisonment in relation to the Avenfield Apartments case. The sentence also extended to his daughter Maryum Nawaz, and Son-in-Law Retired Captain Safdar, who were given 7 years and 1 year imprisonment respectively. On 29 September 2022, a Pakistani court quashed the conviction of Maryam Nawaz, the daughter of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, in a corruption case that had seen her sentenced to seven years in jail. A two-judge panel found there was no evidence to prove the prosecution case that Maryam Nawaz abetted any corruption in buying high-end apartments in London.

In the following election, PMLN suffered a massive blow due to these corruptions charges, with a net loss of 24.35%. PMLN blamed this primarily on alleged vote rigging and administrative malpractices. However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) outright rejected such reports and stated that the elections were conducted fair and free. The European Union Election Observation Mission said that no rigging had been found during the election, and polling was termed to be &quot;transparent&quot;.

In a hearing presided over by a division bench consisting of Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamir Farooq and Justice Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb, appeals filed by Nawaz Sharif against his sentence in the Avenfield and Al-Azizia Steel Mills cases were considered. The result of the proceedings was the acquittal of PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on 29 November 2023 from the charges pertaining to the Avenfield Apartments references.

=== Allegations of treachery ===
Nawaz gave an interview to Dawn News on 12 May 2018 in which he said that non-state actors from Pakistan were involved in the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008. A spokesman for Sharif said that Indian media had twisted his statement to make it seem like he had suggested that the state of Pakistan endorsed and was directly involved in the attacks. A National Security Council meeting was called by the Pakistan Army which declared the allegations were based on lies and misconception without specifically naming Sharif.

<text>Étaples or Étaples-sur-Mer (; or ; formerly ; ) is a commune in the department of Pas-de-Calais, Hauts-de-France, northern France. It is a fishing and leisure port on the Canche river.

==History==
Étaples takes its name from having been a medieval staple port (&quot;stapal&quot; in Old Dutch), from which word the Old French word &quot;Estaples&quot; derives. As a port it was part of the administrative and economic complex centred on Montreuil after access from the sea to that town was restricted by silting.

The site of modern Étaples lies on the ridge of dunes which once lay to seaward of a marsh formed off-shore from the chalk plateau of Artois. From the Canche northwards, the dunes tend to extend inland, all the way to the old chalk cliff. It lay just outside the southern edge of the mediaeval Boulonnais and some eighteen kilometres () south of the geological region of that name.

The dunes were established as the sea level rose during the Quaternary and show signs of habitation during the Palaeolithic. They had therefore stabilized at something like their present form by 2000 BC. The dunes to the north-west of the town have revealed Iron Age, Gaulish material.

===The Early-Medieval settlement===
Étaples was one of a number of sites formerly identified as Quentovicus from which, as from Boulogne-sur-Mer, Roman ships prepared for the passage to Britannia. However, excavations coordinated by Dr David Hill of Manchester University between 1984 and 1991 uncovered the remains of a substantial settlement at Visemarest near the hamlet of La Calotterie. This site is located to the east of Étaples, further up the Canche valley, near the town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. This is now accepted as the site of Quentovic, although the finds from the excavations were located in the Musée de Quentovic in Étaples (at present indefinitely closed).

===The Middle Ages===
During the ninth century the coast was subject to raids and settlement by Norsemen. From their point of view, this off-shore site, protected by mud flats and marsh, was ideal as a base from which to conduct raids elsewhere, assemble the booty and ship it home.

In 1172, Matthew of Alsace, Count of Boulogne, built a fortress on the old Roman site. In 1193, King Philip Augustus made it the main port of his northern fleet after the southern end of the County of Boulogne (The Boulonnais) was added to the royal domain, forming the only direct access to this coast from royal lands in the hinterland.

Étaples was to suffer particularly during the Hundred Years War, owing to its proximity to the English landing places a little further north. Edward III of England burnt the port in 1346 as he was returning from the Battle of Crécy. In 1351 it was sacked by Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March and burned in 1359 by Edward&#x27;s son, John of Gaunt. There were sieges in 1378 and 1435 and it was burnt again in 1455 and 1546. To complete its disasters, the town had a severe outbreak of the plague in 1596.

===The Renaissance onwards===
On 3 November 1492, the castle was the scene of the signing of the Treaty of Étaples between Charles VIII of France and Henry VII of England. At the time of the Field of the Cloth of Gold, the diplomatic meeting near Calais between Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England, Francis stayed in the castle of Étaples. The meeting took place at Balinghem from 7 to 24 June 1520 and Francis slept at the castle on the 27th. Louis XIV was received there on 26 May 1637 and it was dismantled around 1641.

===The Napoleonic period===
Between 1803 and 1805, Napoleon gathered a large army in places along this coast, principally at Boulogne, so as to threaten an invasion of England. As part of this, for two years the Sixth Army Corps of Marshal Ney was stationed in and near to Étaples. The Emperor came several times to the town to review his troops. After the Battle of Trafalgar ended any hope of providing naval cover for an invasion, the troops moved on.

===The 19th century and the influence of the railway===
By the mid-19th century, the Bradshaw railway guide was describing Étaples as &#x27;a decayed fishing port, on a sandy plain&#x27;. The railway between Amiens and Boulogne had recently been built northwards along the coast and the Étaples-Le Touquet station was opened in 1848. Traffic was increased when the local railway company was amalgamated with the Chemins de fer du Nord in 1851 and the connection between Boulogne and Calais was completed in 1867, slowly reversing the decay. The line enabled the swift transport of fish inland as far as Paris, displacing the old chasse-marée system and requiring changes to working practices in order to accommodate the rail timetables. The town&#x27;s economy also benefited from the influx of holiday visitors as what is now called the Côte d&#x27;Opale was developed. However, Étaples remained a working port with its fishing and associated trades such as boat building and rope making. The main holiday resort was developed away, south of the river, at what was then called Paris-Plage. The two banks of the Canche were linked by a road bridge in 1860 and the Étaples tramway was built from the town station to the resort in 1900. The big money flowed there and cheaper prices in the town attracted an international colony of artists between 1880 and 1914.
===World War I===
The railway, with its network of connections across the north of France, became of strategic importance during World War I, and it was added to temporarily during the period it lasted. Étaples became the principal depôt and transit camp for the British Expeditionary Force in France and also the point to which the wounded were transported.

Among the atrocities of the war, the hospitals there were bombed and machine-gunned from the air several times during May 1918. In one hospital alone, it was reported, &#x27;One ward received a direct hit and was blown to pieces, six wards were reduced to ruins and three others were severely damaged. Sister Baines, four orderlies and eleven patients were killed outright, whilst two doctors, five sisters and many orderlies and patients were wounded.&#x27;

The military camp had a reputation for harshness and the treatment received by the men there led to the Étaples Mutiny in 1917. Étaples was also, from a later British scientific viewpoint, at the centre of the 1918 flu pandemic. The British virologist, John Oxford, and other researchers, have suggested that the Étaples troop staging camp was at the centre of the 1918 flu pandemic or at least home to a significant precursor virus to it. There was a mysterious respiratory infection at the military base during the winter of 1915–16.

Private A S Bullock recorded in his World War I memoir entering Étaples with his battalion just after the armistice. The camp, he noted, was &#x27;almost infinitely expandable at very short notice&#x27;, attributable to its organisation in groups of huts, each of which contained a headquarters, a cookhouse, and a store housing numerous additional tents and equipment. Bullock also describes the military hospital, whose thirty or so inmates were all &#x27;murderers...at psychological war with one another&#x27;.

The nearby six-hectare Étaples Military Cemetery is resting place to 11,658 British and Allied soldiers from the conflict. When the war artist John Lavery depicted it in 1919, he showed a train in the background, running along the bank of the river below the sandy crest on which the cemetery was sited.

Following the war, the town was given recognition by the French state for the difficulty of accommodating up to 80,000 men at a time over four years (according to Bullock &#x27;when full it could accommodate half a million men&#x27;) and the damage done by the enemy bombing which their presence attracted, and it was awarded the Croix de guerre in 1920.

===World War II===
In World War II, Étaples suffered again from German bombing and the tramway was irreparably damaged. The town was then occupied by the Germans and during the Allied invasion was again bombarded, causing seventy civilian casualties and destroying or damaging a third of its houses. In 1949, the Minister of Defence came and added a &quot;palme&quot; (bar) to the Croix de guerre.

==Demography==
In 1807 the population was recorded as 1,507 and had grown to 4,692 by 1901.
This had nearly doubled to 9,095 by 1968 and had grown to 11,714 in 2007.

<text>The Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid e Azam Group) ; &quot;Pākistān Muslim Līg (Qāf)&quot;, Acronyms: PML(Q), PML-Q, PMLQ, &quot;Q League&quot; (officially registered as the Pakistan Muslim League) is a political party in Pakistan. As of the 2024 parliamentary election, it has a representation of five seats. It previously served as an ally of former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf&#x27;s government, and led a joint election campaign in 2013 alongside Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in Punjab and Balochistan provinces against its rival Pakistan Muslim League (N), a fiscally conservative and centre-right force.

Its leadership and members were once part of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) presided by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. After the 1997 general elections, political differences arose that ultimately led to the creation of a faction inside the party. The dissidents, led by Shujaat Hussain, called for strong and vocal support for the 1999 military coup d&#x27;état staged and led by then-Chief of Army Staff and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Pervez Musharraf. In 2002, dissident leaders launched the party, focused on President Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s government. It later became an integral part of Musharraf&#x27;s government and appointed their own prime minister, Shaukat Aziz.

Dissident leader Shujaat Hussain was named party president, and the party&#x27;s focus turned to drawing in PML-N voters. Further advantage was taken by Musharraf, who granted opportunities to the party with a goal of exclusive support of the government and to diminish the public support of Sharif.

The emergence of PML-N as the largest opposition party after the 2008 elections led to a significant collapse of PML-Q&#x27;s influence. The party suffered many setbacks thereafter when its membership began to disintegrate after forming a separate bloc with close association with the PML-N, including the Like-Minded and Avami League blocs and second, the former president&#x27;s bloc. Senior members joined PML-N, while the junior leadership defected to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).

In September 2010, PML-Q joined the similar ideological faction, PML-F, forming the Pakistan Muslim League (Pir Pagara), but this was short-lived when in May 2011 the party joined the Yousaf Raza Gillani led-government to fulfill the gap left by its rival PML-N. However, the party announced its resignation from the Parliament, citing the failure of the Pakistan Peoples Party to resolve the energy crisis as the reason, which had direct impact on the federal government. The situation become better by giving relief in fuel prices on 15 June 2012.

==History==
The founder of PML (Q) is Mian Muhammad Azhar. It attracted influential members such as the Chaudhary&#x27;s of Gujrat, Pervaiz Elahi, and Chaudhary Shujaat Hussain. 75% of its elected members are former &quot;big men&quot; of the Zia ul Haq and Nawaz Sharif governments. PML-N factions broke away in 2001 under NAB&#x27;s pressure to form PML (Q). They were staunch Musharraf supporters and consider him their mentor. Although, he was sometimes mistakenly cited as a member, he was never part of the party.

===Split from PML-N===
PML (Q) started as a small group of half a dozen like-minded people in the Nawaz Sharif-led faction of PML-N, including Azhar, Khurshid Kasuri, Syeda Abida Hussain and her husband Syed Fakhar Imam. Azhar remained party president initially before he joined Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. Musharraf asked Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Chaudhry Pervez Elahi to &quot;galvanise and reinvent the Muslim League&quot;. Several well known leaders later joined the PML (Q) while Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain was president. PML(Q) launched on 20 August 2002.

==Ideology and vision==
===Ideology===
PML(Q) is usually associated with conservatism and Pakistani nationalism and its stated priorities continue to include transforming Pakistan into a welfare state, promoting Islamizaton within minority rights and egalitarian values, establishing a conservative democracy, maintaining a strong relationship between civilians and military establishment.

==2002 general elections==

During the 20 October 2002 legislative elections, the party won 25.7% votes and 126 out of 342 members.

==United PML==

In May 2004, various PML factions and other political parties merged with PML-Q to form a united Pakistan Muslim League (PML), thus leaving out only the Nawaz Sharf-led faction. They included former President Farooq Leghari&#x27;s Millat Party, Jahan Zaib Awan, National Peoples Party, Arbab Ghulam Rahim&#x27;s Sindh Democratic Alliance, Hamid Nasir Chattha&#x27;s PML (Junejo), Pir Pagara&#x27;s PML (Functional), Manzoor Wattoo&#x27;s PML (Jinnah), and Ijaz-ul-Haq&#x27;s PML (Zia). Later on, the Pir Pagara led faction called the PML-Functional again parted ways with the united PML, which reduced the number of parties called Pakistan Muslim League to three: PML-Q, PML-N and PML-F.

==2008 general elections==

The Pakistan Muslim League (Q) contested the February 2008 legislative election with other allied parties including Muttahida Qaumi Movement, Pakistan Muslim League (F), and National Peoples Party. It was believed that the party wanted former Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi to become prime minister. The PML (Q) lost major parliamentarians in the 2008 election, gaining only 49 elected seats, defeated by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the PML (N).

==2013 general elections==

PML (Q) contested the 2013 election in alliance with PPP. The party won only two seats in national assembly, along with eight seats in Punjab assembly and four seats in Balochistan assembly. In Sindh and KPK assemblies, they were shut out, cadging only 3.11% of popular vote, relegating it from number two to number six in terms of votes.

==2018 general elections==

PML (Q) contested the 2018 election. The party won five seats in national assembly, along with ten seats in Punjab assembly, and one seat in KPK assembly.

==&#x27;Like-minded group&#x27; break away==

A rift within party leadership emerged with a faction calling themselves the &#x27;Like-minded&#x27; bloc, who opposed the Chaudhry&#x27;s of Gujrat leadership bid.

The new faction announced that Hamid Nasir Chattha would be the chairman, Salim Saifullah the president, and Humayun Akhtar Khan the secretary general. Other prominent leaders to join this parallel set-up includes (former foreign ministers) Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri (appointed as chairman of the steering committee) former information and organising secretary PML-Q Azeem Chaudhary, former member National Assembly Asiya Azeem, Gohar Ayub Khan and Kashmala Tariq.

In February 2010, the mainstream PML-Q was further affected by the resignation of Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq, and the revival of his Pakistan Muslim League (Z) party.

==Alliances==
Party President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi consistently supported Musharraf. They were faithful to the general in even the most adverse circumstances.

Shujaat Hussain&#x27;s father Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was initially a supporter of President Ayub Khan, but when Amir Mohammad Khan favoured some of his local opponents, he parted ways with Ayub&#x27;s Convention Muslim League. He opposed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and later joined Zia&#x27;s government. He was killed allegedly by Al-Zulfikar organisation for his support to General Zia. After Zahoor&#x27;s death, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain continued to support Zia and his Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s. Mr. Syed Kabir Ali Wasti senior vice president and chairman media committee of PMLQ was back bone of PMLQand remained very active in politics to make PMLQ sweep 2002 elections.As Syed Kabir Ali Wasti was formerly president of Pakistan Muslim League Qasim group and was close aide to Malik Qasim of Pakistan Muslim League-Qasim group. He supported former prime minister Benazir Bhutto but later Joined Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid-i-Azam and became Senior Vice President of the party during the government of Gen Pervez Musharraf.

However, he developed differences with the PML-Q and remained inactive in politics for some time and later supported Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. Islamization policies. Once the establishment parted ways with Nawaz Sharif in 1999, Hussain and Zahoor came to the rescue of stability and saw their new party PML (Q) win the general elections of 2002. Both the Chaudhry brothers were accused of financial scandals, including the Cooperative Scandal, sugar scandal and bank loan defaults, but none of them were ever proven or even pursued by the government. Nowadays, the Q-league has been reduced to a minor party as their vote-bank has been devoured by both Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.

==Party leadership==
As of 2024, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain is president of PML-Q. He was elected unopposed until 2026.

Prominent leaders of PMLQ are as below:

<text>Khodynka Field (, &quot;Khodynskoye pole&quot;) is a large open space in the north-west of Moscow, at the beginning of the present day Leningradsky Prospect. It takes its name from the small Khodynka River which used to cross the neighbourhood.

The field is close to several Moscow Metro stations including Dinamo and Aeroport on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line, and Oktyabrskoe Pole on the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line, which is named after Khodynka field.

==Early history==

Khodynka Field (up to the 17th century &quot;Khodinskiy Meadow&quot;) has been known as such since the 14th century. The first mention of this name dates back to 1389, when Knyaz Dmitry Donskoy bequeathed Khodyinsky Meadow to his son Yuri Dmitrievich.

For a long time the field was undeveloped, placed it on arable land Tver coachmen settlement. At the beginning of the 17th century, the army of Tsar Vasili IV fought here against the troops of False Dmitry II.

During the reign of Catherine the Great, in 1775, the field was the scene of grand festivities on the successful conclusion of the war with Turkey with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca.

In the 19th century, Khodynka was used to celebrate state occasions. In June 1883, the coronation of Alexander III was celebrated here. The event was co-ordinated by Mikhail Lentovsky and included four theatres, a circus, puppet shows, choirs, and orchestras. The climax was an allegorical procession entitled &quot;Spring is Beautiful&quot;. In May 1896, the site was used to celebrate coronation of Tsar Nicholas II. Rumours about a shortage in food and that the coronation mugs contained a gold coin resulted in a stampede in which more than 1000 (some sources say 1500) people were trampled to death (see Khodynka Tragedy).

Major constructions on the field included the 19th century military barracks and the Botkin Hospital, the largest in Moscow at the time of its inauguration in 1910.

===Khodynka Tragedy===
The field is best known as the site of a tragic accident on May 30, 1896 during the festivities of the crowning of Nicholas II.

In the area of one town square, buffooneries, theaters, 150 buffets for distribution of gifts, and 20 pubs were built for the celebrations. Nearby to the celebration square was a field which had a ravine and many gullies. On the evening of May 17, people who had heard rumours of rich coronation gifts from the tsar (the gift was actually a bread roll, a piece of sausage, gingerbread and a mug) began to gather in anticipation.

At about 5 o&#x27;clock in the morning of the coronation day, several thousand people were already gathered on the field. A police force of 1800 men failed to maintain civil order, and in a catastrophic crush, and resulting panic to flee the scene, 1389 people were trampled to death and roughly 1300 were otherwise injured.

The negligence of the imperial authorities caused public indignation in Russia, and a number of minor officials were dismissed. However, the new Tsar did not cancel the coronation ball scheduled for later that day. Many mystic writers in Russia say that deed predestined the death of Nicholas in Soviet Russia.

==Khodynka Airfield==

The first powered flight in Russia took place at Khodynka, carried out in 1910 by Boris Rossinsky. In 1911, pilot Alexander Vasiliev landed his Bleriot XI there, becoming the only finisher of 11 pilots who started a 453-mile race from St. Petersburg to Moscow. Starting in the 1930s, the airfield played annual host to Aviation Day festivities, held on the third weekend in August.

A. S. Yakovlev worked as a mechanic at the airfield for a time in the 1920s, and examined the wrecks of various aircraft present in the ravine near the field during work on his earliest powered aircraft designs.

The airfield is surrounded by a variety of restricted-access facilities, including the main headquarters of Aeroflot, design bureaux for Ilyushin, Mikoyan Gurevich (MiG), Sukhoi and Yakovlev, the Aircraft Production Organization No. 30 (MAPO), and GRU headquarters (&quot;the Aquarium&quot;). The National Aviation and Space Museum (aka the National Aeronautics Museum or the Museum of the Air Forces) was on the airfield proper.

Flights into or out of the airfield apparently continued to at least 1989, but the runways existed into the 2000s.

Past plans for the site included a modern air and space museum, expected to be the largest in the world upon completion.

==Modern developments==
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness hoped to have the largest temple in Russia to be erected there, but this did not come to pass due to vocal opposition by the Russian Orthodox Church.

Megasport Arena, an ice sport palace, was opened on the Khodynka Field in 2006, and hosts EuroLeague matches of the PBC CSKA Moscow basketball club. In 2016 CSKA Moscow Stadium was opened on the opposite side of Megasport arena, serving as a home venue for football club CSKA Moscow.

<text>Denise Lorraine Majette (born May 18, 1955) is an American politician from the state of Georgia. A Democrat, she represented Georgia&#x27;s 4th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2005.

==Biography==
Born in Brooklyn, she attended Yale University and completed a Juris Doctor degree at Duke University in 1979. She began her legal career in North Carolina as a Legal Aid staff attorney and a clinical adjunct law professor at Wake Forest University. A resident of the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain since 1983, Majette worked in private law practice before being named an administrative law judge at the Georgia state board of workers&#x27; compensation in 1992. The following year, Georgia Governor Zell Miller appointed her judge of the State Court of DeKalb County. Majette held the judgeship for nine years.

She resigned from the judgeship in 2002 to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in , which is based in DeKalb County. She defeated 10-year incumbent Cynthia McKinney in the Democratic primary. Majette, who had never run in a partisan contest before, defeated McKinney by a 58% to 42% margin. McKinney had attracted controversy due to her comments after the September 11 attacks. The primary was also influenced by crossover-Republicans—i.e., Republicans who used their ability to vote in a Democratic primary in Georgia. Majette&#x27;s upset win was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district.

In Congress, Majette&#x27;s voting record was slightly more moderate than that of McKinney. Nonetheless, she is considered fairly liberal by national Democratic standards. Among other issues, she supports affirmative action, abortion rights, and legal status for illegal immigrants working in the U.S., while she opposes school vouchers and the death penalty.

==Runs for higher office ==

After one term in the U.S. House, Majette decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Zell Miller, who had been appointed to the seat in 2000 following the death of Republican Paul Coverdell. Miller&#x27;s decision not to seek a full term in the Senate had caught the Georgia Democrats by surprise. Majette&#x27;s announcement that she would seek to replace Miller also caught Democrats by surprise, as she was not on anyone&#x27;s call list when Democrats began seeking a candidate to replace Miller. Further skepticism among Democrats about the viability of her candidacy surfaced when she announced that &quot;God&quot; had told her to run for the Senate.

Majette finished first in the Democratic primary but was forced into a runoff against millionaire businessman Cliff Oxford, which she won. She received important endorsements from Senators Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, along with many others in Washington who campaigned and raised money for Majette. Her Senate campaign slogan was &quot;I&#x27;ll be nobody&#x27;s Senator, but yours.&quot; Majette was the first African American and the first woman to be nominated for the U.S. Senate in Georgia.

In the general election, despite her vigorous attacks against her Republican opponent, 6th District Congressman Johnny Isakson, Majette was defeated, losing by 18 points.

A number of factors led to the severe defeat. Majette was badly under financed and had to spend valuable time and money in the runoff. In contrast, Isakson had won the Republican nomination by an unexpectedly large margin. Due to her late entry in the race, she had little time or chance to make up ground on Isakson. A proposed amendment to the Georgia Constitution banning same-sex marriages (which Majette opposed) boosted Republican turnout significantly; it not only passed by a wide margin statewide, but carried in every county, even DeKalb. She got little help from the top of the ticket; John Kerry had effectively ceded Georgia to George W. Bush early in the presidential campaign.

McKinney regained her seat in the 2004 election.

== Later career ==
Soon after leaving the House, Majette entered private law practice in Atlanta. In March 2006, Majette announced her candidacy for state School Superintendent of Georgia. She defeated substitute teacher Carlotta Harrell in the primary, garnering 67% of the vote. In the general election, however, Majette lost to Republican incumbent Kathy Cox by a large margin.

=== Disbarment ===
On March 28, 2014, the Georgia Supreme Court disbarred Majette, finding that she overbilled clients and misled the Court about how much she was owed in fees.

==Electoral history==


Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2004, write-ins received 31 votes and Matthew Jamison received 7 votes.

<text>Theodor Eicke (17 October 1892 – 26 February 1943) was both a senior SS functionary and a Waffen-SS divisional commander in Nazi Germany. He was a key figure in the development of Nazi concentration camps. Eicke served as the second commandant of the Dachau concentration camp from June 1933 to July 1934, and together with his adjutant Michael Lippert, was one of the executioners of SA Chief Ernst Röhm during the Night of the Long Knives purge of 1934. He continued to expand and develop the concentration camp system as the first Concentration Camps Inspector. 

In 1939, Eicke became commander of the SS Division Totenkopf of the Waffen-SS, leading the division during the Second World War on the Western and Eastern fronts. Eicke was killed on 26 February 1943, when his plane was shot down during the Third Battle of Kharkov.

==Early life and World War I==
Theodor Eicke was born on 17 October 1892, in Hampont (renamed &quot;Hudingen&quot; in 1915) near Château-Salins, then in the German &quot;Reichsland&quot; (province) of Elsass-Lothringen, the youngest of 11 children of a lower middle-class family. His father was a station master described as a German patriot. Eicke was an underachiever in school, dropping out at the age of 17 before graduation. Instead he joined the Bavarian Army (23rd Bavarian Infantry Regiment at Landau) as a volunteer, and then was transferred to the Bavarian 3rd Infantry Regiment in 1913. 

Upon the start of First World War in 1914, Eicke participated in the Lorraine campaign, fighting at both the First Battle of Ypres in 1914 and the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, and was with the 2nd Bavarian Foot Artillery Regiment at the Battle of Verdun in 1916. Eicke served as a clerk, an assistant paymaster, and a front-line infantryman, and for his bravery during the war was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. Despite being decorated, Eicke spent most of the conflict behind the lines as a regimental paymaster.

Late in 1914, Eicke&#x27;s commander had approved his request to temporarily return home on leave to marry Bertha Schwebel of Ilmenau on 26 December 1914, with whom he had two children: a daughter, Irma, on 5 April 1916 and a son, Hermann, on 4 May 1920. 

Following the end of the First World War, Eicke remained as an army paymaster now in service of the Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic, until resigning from the position in 1919. Eicke began studying at a technical school in Ilmenau, but was forced to drop out shortly due to a lack of funds. From 1920, Eicke pursued a career as a police officer working for two different departments, initially worked as an informant and later as a regular policeman. Eicke&#x27;s police career was ended in 1923 due to his open hatred for the Weimar Republic and his repeated participation in violent political demonstrations. He found work in 1923 at IG Farben in Ludwigshafen and remained there as a &quot;security officer&quot; until 1932.

==SS career==
===Nazi activism, early SS membership, and exile===
Eicke&#x27;s views on the Weimar Republic mirrored those of the Nazi Party, which he joined as member number 114,901 on 1 December 1928; he also joined the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), the Nazi Party&#x27;s paramilitary street organization led by Ernst Röhm. Eicke left the SA by August 1930 to join the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) as member number 2,921, where he quickly rose in rank after recruiting new members and building up the SS organization in the Bavarian Palatinate. In 1931, Eicke was promoted to the rank of SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; (equivalent to colonel) by Heinrich Himmler, the &quot;Reichsführer&quot; of the SS.

In early 1932, his political activities caught the attention of his employer IG Farben, who subsequently terminated his employment. At the same time, he was caught preparing bomb attacks on political enemies in Bavaria for which he received a two-year prison sentence in July 1932. However, due to protection received from the Bavarian Minister of Justice Franz Gürtner, a Nazi sympathizer who would later serve as minister of justice under Adolf Hitler, Eicke was able to avoid his sentence and flee to Italy on orders from Heinrich Himmler. Italy at the time was already a fascist state under the rule of Benito Mussolini, and Eicke was entrusted by Himmler with running a &quot;terrorist training camp for Austrian Nazis&quot; at Lake Garda, and once even had the privilege of &quot;showing Italian dictator Benito Mussolini around.&quot; On 28 October 1932, he officially met with Italian Fascists in the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the March on Rome, at the newly erected Bolzano Victory Monument.

===Return to Germany===
In March 1933, less than three months after Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Eicke returned to Germany. Upon his return, Eicke had political quarrels with &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Joseph Bürckel, who had him arrested and detained for several months in a mental asylum in Würzburg. During his stay at the mental hospital, Eicke was stripped of his rank and SS membership by Himmler for having broken his word of honor. Also during the same month, Himmler set up the first official concentration camp at Dachau; Hitler had indicated his desire that this not be just another prison or detention camp. In June 1933, after the mental asylum&#x27;s director informed Himmler that Eicke was not &quot;mentally unbalanced,&quot; Himmler arranged his release, paid his family 200 Reich marks as a gift, reinstated him into the SS, and promoted him to SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; (equivalent to senior colonel). On 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed Eicke commandant of the Dachau concentration camp after complaints and criminal proceedings were brought against the camp&#x27;s first commandant, SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Hilmar Wäckerle, following the murder of several detainees under the &quot;guise of punishment&quot;. Eicke requested a permanent unit and Himmler granted the request, forming the &quot;SS-Wachverbände&quot; (Guard Unit).

===Development of concentration camp system===
Eicke was promoted on 30 January 1934 to SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; (equivalent to Generalmajor in the German Army and a brigadier general, in the US Army), and began to extensively reorganize the Dachau camp from its original configuration under Wäckerle. Eicke fired half of the 120 guards who had been billeted at Dachau when he arrived, and devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. He established new guarding provisions, which included rigid discipline, total obedience to orders, and tightening disciplinary and punishment regulations for detainees. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike, and it was Eicke who introduced the infamous blue and white striped pyjamas that came to symbolize the Nazi concentration camps across Europe. The uniforms for the guards at the camps had a special &quot;death&#x27;s head&quot; insignia on their collars. While Eicke&#x27;s reforms ended the haphazard brutality that had characterized the original camps, the new regulations were very far from humane: heavy-handed discipline, including death in some cases, was instituted for even trivial offenses. Eicke was known for his brutality, detested weakness, and instructed his men that any SS man with a soft heart should &quot;... retire at once to a monastery&quot;. Historian Nikolaus Wachsmann asserts that while it was Himmler who established the &quot;general direction for the later SS camp system,&quot; it was Eicke who &quot;became its powerful motor.&quot; Eicke&#x27;s antisemitism, anti-bolshevism, as well as his insistence on unconditional obedience towards him, the SS, and Hitler, made a positive impression on Himmler. By May 1934, Eicke had already styled himself as the &quot;inspector of concentration camps&quot; for Nazi Germany. 
===Night of the Long Knives===
In early 1934, Hitler and other Nazi leaders became concerned that Ernst Röhm, the SA Chief of Staff, was planning a coup d&#x27;état. On 21 June, Hitler decided that Röhm and the SA leadership had to be eliminated, and on 30 June began a national purge of the SA leadership and other enemies of the state in an event that became known as the Night of the Long Knives. Eicke, along with hand-chosen members of the SS and Gestapo, assisted Sepp Dietrich&#x27;s &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; in the arrest and imprisonment of SA commanders, before they were subsequently shot. After Röhm was arrested, Hitler gave him the choice to commit suicide or be shot. Eicke entered the cell and placed a revolver on Röhm&#x27;s prison-cell table and informed him that he had &quot;ten minutes to make good on Hitler&#x27;s offer.&quot; When Röhm refused to kill himself, he was shot dead by Eicke and his adjutant, Michael Lippert, on 1 July 1934. Eicke proclaimed that he was proud for having shot Röhm, and shortly after the affair on 4 July 1934, Himmler officially named Eicke chief of the &quot;Inspektion der Konzentrationslager&quot; (Concentration Camps Inspectorate or CCI). Himmler also promoted Eicke to the rank of SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; in command of the &quot;SS-Wachverbände&quot;. As a result of the Night of the Long Knives, the SA was extensively weakened, and the remaining SA-run camps were taken over by the SS. Further, in 1935, Dachau became the training center for the concentration camps service.

===Camp inspector===
In his role as the Concentration Camps Inspector, Eicke began a mass reorganisation of the camps in 1935. On 29 March 1936, the concentration camp guards and administration units were officially designated as the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS-TV), and the introduction of forced labour made the camps one of the SS&#x27;s most powerful tools. This earned him the enmity of Reinhard Heydrich, who had already unsuccessfully attempted to take control of the Dachau concentration camp in his position as chief of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD), but Eicke prevailed due to his support from Heinrich Himmler. In April 1936, Eicke was named commander of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (Death&#x27;s Head Troops) and the number of men under his command increased from 2,876 to 3,222; the unit was also provided official funding through the Reich&#x27;s budget office, and he was allowed to recruit future troops from the Hitler Youth based on regional needs. Ideological and military training for new recruits working the camps were both intensified under Eiche&#x27;s command. The numerous smaller camps in the system were dismantled and replaced with new larger camps. Dachau concentration camp remained, then Sachsenhausen concentration camp opened in summer 1936, Buchenwald in summer 1937 and Ravensbrück (near Lichtenburg concentration camp) in May 1939. Following the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria, new camps were set up there, such as Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, opened in 1938. Sometime in August 1938, Eicke&#x27;s entire supporting staff was moved to Oranienburg (near Sachsenhausen) where the &quot;Inspektion&quot; office would remain until 1945. Nonetheless, Eicke&#x27;s role as the person designated to inspect concentration camps placed him within the framework of Heydrich&#x27;s SD secret state police; whereas his command of the Death&#x27;s Head units, made him accountable to the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) of the SS. All regulations for SS-run camps, both for guards and prisoners, followed the model established by Eicke at the Dachau camp.

==SS Division Totenkopf==

At the beginning of World War II in 1939, the success of the Totenkopf&#x27;s sister formations, the SS-Infanterie-Regiment (mot) &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; and the three &quot;Standarten&quot; of the SS-&quot;Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT) led to the creation of three additional Waffen-SS divisions by October 1939. Eicke was given command of a new division, the SS Division Totenkopf, which was formed from concentration camp guards of the 1st (&quot;Oberbayern&quot;), 2nd (&quot;Brandenburg&quot;) and 3rd (&quot;Thüringen&quot;) &quot;Standarten&quot; (regiments) of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände,&quot; and soldiers from the SS Heimwehr &quot;Danzig&quot;. After Eicke was assigned to combat duty, his deputy Richard Glücks was appointed the new CCI chief by Himmler. By 1940, the CCI came under the administrative control of the &quot;SS-Hauptamt Verwaltung und Wirtschaft&quot; (SS Office [for] Administration and Business) which was set up under Oswald Pohl. In 1942, the CCI became &quot;Amt D&quot; (Office D) of the consolidated &quot;SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt&quot; (SS Economic and Administrative Department; WVHA) also under Pohl. Therefore, the entire concentration camp system was placed under the authority of the WVHA with the Inspector of Concentration Camps now a subordinate to the Chief of the WVHA. Pohl assured Eicke that the command structure he had introduced would not fall to the jurisdiction of the Gestapo or SD. The CCI and later &quot;Amt D&quot; were subordinate to the SD and Gestapo only in regards to who was admitted to the camps and who was released, and what happened inside the camps was under the command of &quot;Amt D&quot;.

The SS Division Totenkopf, also known as the Totenkopf Division, went on to become one of the most effective German formations on the Eastern Front, fighting during invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, as well as the summer offensive in 1942, the capture of Kharkov, in the Demyansk Pocket, during the Vistula–Oder Offensive, and the Battle of Budapest in 1945. During the course of the war, Eicke and his division became known for their effectiveness but also brutality and war crimes, including the murder of 97 British POWs in Le Paradis, France, in 1940, while serving on the Western Front. The division was also known for the frequent murder of captured Soviet soldiers and the widespread pillaging of Soviet villages.

==Death==
Eicke was killed on 26 February 1943, during the opening stages of the Third Battle of Kharkov, when his Fieseler Fi 156 Storch reconnaissance aircraft was shot down between the villages of Artil&#x27;ne and Mykolaivka, south of Kharkov near Lozova by Red Army anti-aircraft artillery. Eicke was portrayed in the Axis press as a hero and soon after his death, one of the Totenkopf&#x27;s infantry regiments received the cuff title &quot;Theodor Eicke&quot; in remembrance of him. Eicke was first buried at a German military cemetery near the village of Oddykhne (Оддихне) in the Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine. When the Germans were forced to retreat as the Red Army counter-attacked, Himmler had Eicke&#x27;s body moved to a cemetery in Hegewald south of Zhitomir in Ukraine. Eicke&#x27;s body remained in Ukraine, where it was likely bulldozed by Soviet forces, since it was customary for them to destroy German graves.

<text>The People&#x27;s Democratic Movement is a political party in Papua New Guinea.

It was founded by Paias Wingti in 1985, after his faction left the Pangu Party. Wingti served as prime minister from 1985 to 1988 and from 1992 to 1994. He was later replaced as leader by Mekere Morauta who also served as prime minister during his leadership of the PDM from 1999 to 2002.

The party won 13 of 109 seats at the 2002 general election. It became the second largest party in Parliament, but the largest party, the National Alliance Party led by Michael Somare formed the government. The PDM joined the opposition in the National Parliament. Before the 2007 general elections, Morauta lost the leadership of the party and founded his own party, the Papua New Guinea Party, while Wingti became the leader of the PDM again. At the 2007 general elections, the PDM was heavily defeated, winning 5 seats in Parliament. Wingti was among those who lost their seats, and Morauta’s new Papua New Guinea Party became the largest opposition party with 8 seats. The PDM left the opposition and joined Somare’s coalition government.

In the 2012 general election, all 6 PDM members joined other parties before going into the election, with Wingti returning in Western Highlands Regional to become the Governor of the Province, and Tommy Tomscholl elected in Middle Ramu Open. Tomscholl was appointed Minister for Agriculture and Livestock by Peter O&#x27;Neill, but subsequently defected to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s People&#x27;s National Congress, leaving Wingti as the party&#x27;s sole MP. Joe Koim Komun of Jiwaka Province has since joined PDM, having formerly sat as an independent.

As of May 2019, the party had one seat in the National Parliament.

<text>The Pangu Pati (Pangu Party), officially Papua na Niugini Yunion Pati (), is a nationalist and developmentalist political party in Papua New Guinea. The party is the oldest political party in Papua New Guinea and has held all levels of government throughout its history. As of 2023, it is the largest party in the National Parliament.

==History==
The Pangu Pati was established on 13 June 1967, in order to contest the elections of 1968 (Papua and New Guinea). At the time of its founding, the party stood-out as its ideals were for a political unification of Papua and New Guinea, stronger economic development and to grow the national income. Other parties, such as the United Christian Democratic Party (UCDP), were in favour of Australian statehood. Although the party, and its candidates, were not in a formal political union, there were ten candidates of Pangu that were elected to the House of Assembly. The 1972 election, the last under Australian authority, saw Pangu-endorsed candidates win eighteen seats, with a total of pro-Pangu candidates reaching twenty-six.

Somare later served as Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea as the leader of the Pangu Party from 1972 to 1980 and from 1982 to 1985. In 1985, Paias Wingti led a faction of the party to split with Somare, and Wingti won a no-confidence vote against Somare, succeeding him as prime minister. In 1988, Somare was replaced as leader of Pangu by Rabbie Namaliu who served as prime minister from 1988 to 1992. Somare would then become leader of the National Alliance Party.

At the 2002 elections, the party won 6 of 109 seats, under the leadership of Chris Haiveta. After that election, Somare returned to power as prime minister. Pangu became a member of his coalition government, and continued to support the Somare government after the 2007 elections, in which Pangu won 5 seats.

It won only one seat at the 2012 election, that of Angoram MP Ludwig Schulze, but was left unrepresented when Schulze died in March 2013. In August 2014, Deputy Opposition Leader Sam Basil crossed to Pangu and reactivated its parliamentary wing, taking on the leadership. The party&#x27;s numbers increased to two in August 2015 when William Samb won a by-election in Goilala Open, then to nine following the 2017 elections.

At the 2022 elections, Pangu won a decisive first-place showing, its best since 1982, with 39 seats. James Marape, who had defected from the previously largest party, the PNC, to Pangu, continued his tenure as Prime Minister. This followed several other defections from the PNC to Pangu, largely attributed to the protracted crisis of leadership under Prime Minister O&#x27;Neill.

<text>Adlington is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Chorley in Lancashire, England, near the West Pennine Moors. It is south of Chorley. It became a separate parish in 1842 then grew into a township around the textile and coal mining industries until these closed in the 1960s. It had a population of 5,270 at the 2001 census, and risen to 6,010 at the 2011 census. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs through the village, where it holds White Bear Marina, the largest marina on the Canal.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The last element &#x27;ington&#x27; indicates that Adlington was an Anglo-Saxon settlement from about A.D. 650, while the first element is either a personal name, Eadwulf, or the aetheling or prince. Recorded spellings include, in 1190 Edeluinton, in 1202 Adelventon, in 1246 Adelinton and, in 1288 Adlington.

===Manor===
Adlington was part of the Penwortham barony granted to Randle de Marsey and later held by the Ferrers. In 1184 Hugh Gogard granted land to Cockersand Abbey. In 1202 Walter de Adlington granted six oxgangs of land to Siward de Duxbury. In 1230, Roger de Maresheya sold the township to the Earl of Chester. In 1288, Hugh de Adlington and Adam de Duxbury each held a moiety of the manor of William de Ferrers. The Duxbury portion was sold early in the 14th century and subdivided; several local families holding fractions. Land belonging to the St. Nicholas chantry in Standish Church was acquired by William Heaton, who died in 1619. John Pilkington, who had taken up arms for the king, but later took the side of Parliament in the civil war, had his estate sequestered.

In 1307, John Adlington paid rent to Sir Gilbert Standish. In 1374, Robert le Norreys of Burton quitclaimed his share to Hugh of Standish. In 1378, Sir Nicholas de Harrington held land subsequently held by Lord Ferrers of Groby and Thomas Harrington. There was a partition as some land was held of Lord Mounteagle, the Harringtons&#x27; successor.

In 1469, Hugh de Adlington gave the manor to his son, Robert who conveyed it to John Tarleton and Hugh Culcheth. Adlington fell in and out of the Adlington family ownership for over five centuries. Hugh Adlington died in 1525 holding messuages of Lord Mounteagle. His son Hugh died in 1556 holding the same estate which he left to his son John. Hugh Adlington died in 1640 holding the manor of Lord Morley and Mounteagle. His son Hugh was predeceased by his eldest son, John, who was killed fighting for the king at the Siege of Chester in 1644. Hugh was succeeded by Peter who had no surviving children and the manor descended to John&#x27;s daughter Eleanor, who married Samuel Robinson of Chester in 1664.

Before 1700, the manor was bought by Thomas Clayton, who died in 1722. The estate descended to his grandson Richard Clayton and in 1770, to his nephew, Sir Richard, who was created a baronet in 1774 and built Adlington Hall in 1771. Richard, consul at Nantes, died in 1828 and was succeeded by his daughter Henrietta, wife of General Robert Browne, who assumed the Clayton name. Their son, Richard Clayton Browne Clayton, died in November 1886. His only son died at Sevastopol and Adlington Hall passed to James Robert Browne Clayton Dawbeny. Wigan council bought the 129-acre estate in 1921 to safeguard the village&#x27;s water supply.

Adlington Hall, built on rising ground in 1771 by Sir Richard Clayton, was a Georgian mansion of brick and stone, and replaced an ancient timber and plaster house on the same site. It was demolished in the 1960s.

===Industrial Revolution===
Coal was mined in the area for centuries, first outcrops of coal and bell pits and then deeper shafts to the Arley mine (seam) at 137 feet. The Adlington Coal Company sank Ellerbeck Colliery in 1876. The company went bankrupt in 1932. The mine was run privately during the 1930s and in 1947 was nationalised. As part of the National Coal Board in 1958, Ellerbeck Colliery employed 411 men and women who worked as &quot;pit brow lasses&quot;, it closed in 1965. In the late 1970s and early &#x27;80s Ellerbeck was open cast and has been landscaped.

In 1891 Davies and Eckersley operated the Huyton Bleachworks and the Pin Croft Dyeing and Printing Company were bleachers and finishers. The largest mill was Adlington Mill, Thomas Gerrard and Sons spinning and weaving mill, which had 43,000 spindles and 900 looms. Springfield Mill operated by Thomas Middeton &amp; Company had 700 looms and Unsworth&#x27;s Brook Mill had 2,700 spindles and 96 looms.

==Governance==

In the Middle Ages Adlington was in the ecclesiastical parish of Standish in the Leyland Hundred of Lancashire. In 1837, Adlington joined with other townships (or civil parishes) in the area to form the Chorley Poor Law Union which took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in that area. A local board was formed in 1872 was replaced by an urban district council of twelve members in 1894.

The village forms part of Chorley Borough which has headquarters at the town hall in Chorley. The village is represented on the council by three Labour Party councillors elected for the Adlington and Anderton ward.
Adlington is part of the Chorley parliamentary constituency, which elected Lindsay Hoyle as Member of Parliament for the Labour party at the 2010 General Election.

==Geography==
Adlington covers an area of 1,064 acres. Its south-east boundary is the River Douglas and Buckow Brook separates the village from Worthington to the west. The Ellerbeck is the boundary with Duxbury.

==Economy==
Adlington&#x27;s economy was based on cotton mills and coal pits but the majority of these traditional industries have disappeared. The construction company Leonard Fairclough &amp; Son was founded and based in the village before becoming part of the bigger AMEC group.

==Transport==

Adlington&#x27;s main road is the A6 from Manchester via Blackrod to Chorley and Preston. It has a junction with the B6227 towards Rivington. The M61 motorway passes the eastern fringe of the village.

Adlington railway station is on the Manchester to Preston Line. Another station, White Bear railway station in Station Road, was on the Lancashire Union Railway between Wigan and Blackburn. It closed in 1960 (the line remained in use for goods until 1974) with the ticket office remaining as a local café. Evidence can be found throughout Adlington of the villages lost line.

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes through Adlington where the White Bear Marina is the largest marina on the canal.

==Religion==
The village has three active churches: St. Paul&#x27;s (the Church of England parish church), St. Joseph&#x27;s (a Roman Catholic church), and the United Reformed and Methodist church on Railway Road.

Christ Church, built in 1839, was used as a chapel of ease after St. Paul&#x27;s Church was built in 1884; it no longer is used for worship and has been converted to a restaurant. Formerly, Adlington also held an iron mission church dedicated to St Philip and Wesleyan, Primitive Methodist, and Congregational churches.

==Sports and recreation==
Adlington has two large recreational areas, the King George&#x27;s Field in the centre of the village and the Lower Playing Fields adjacent to the canal in lower Adlington. The King George&#x27;s Field plays host to the village&#x27;s amateur rugby league club Adlington Rangers and the village&#x27;s football pub teams. Adlington also has a junior football club with a variety of age groups including an open age team. Meadow Road is home to Adlington Cricket Club which plays in the local Lancashire and Bolton leagues.

==Notable people==
Construction magnate Leonard Fairclough was born and lived in Adlington and has a memorial garden dedicated to him in the village. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, was born and raised in the village. John Christopher Bradshaw, a New Zealand organist and university professor, was born in Adlington.

<text>The People&#x27;s Progress Party is a political party in Papua New Guinea.

It was founded on 11 November 1969 by Julius Chan and Warren Dutton, forming a caucus of eleven members of the House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea.

Following independence in 1975, Chan served, while party leader, as Prime Minister from 1980 to 1982 and 1994 to 1997. Chan’s second Government was brought down by the Sandline Affair and the party suffered in the elections that year. Chan and acting Prime Minister John Giheno lost their seats, and Michael Nali became the party’s leader in Parliament.

When Chan was not serving as Prime Minister, the party was often a junior partner in a coalition with the Pangu Party. At the 2002 General Elections, the party won 8 seats, becoming the third largest party. At the 2007 General Election the party lost half of its seats. However, the party’s original leader, Julius Chan, returned to Parliament, and took over the party’s leadership. Chan ran as the opposition candidate for Prime Minister, but received the support of only 21 of the 109 members of Parliament.

The party had 5 members in the 111-seat National Parliament of Papua New Guinea as of September 2019 and was part of the governing coalition of Prime Minister Peter O&#x27;Neill.

==Current party leaders==

* Theodore Zurenuoc - Member for Finschhafen Open

==Former party leaders==
*Michael Nali: Led the party while Chan was out of Parliament. He held various ministerial positions, including Deputy Prime Minister. He switched from his Mendi Open seat to contest the Southern Highlands Provincial electorate in the 2007 Elections but did not win.
*Dr Allan Marat: 2003–2004 - Minister of Trade. Left the party and joined the Melanesian Liberal Party.
*Andrew Baing: 2004–2006 - Minister of Fisheries. Dismissed from Parliament for wrong conduct.
* Sir Julius Chan - Member for New Ireland Provincial

<doc id="409084" wikidata="Q3041851" url="?curid=409084" title="List of political parties in Pakistan">
<text>Pakistan is a multi-party democracy. The country has many political parties and many times in the past the country has been ruled by a coalition government.

The Parliament of Pakistan is bicameral, consisting of the National Assembly of Pakistan and the Senate.

== Brief history and overviews ==
The military-dominated Establishment has directly ruled Pakistan for nearly half of its existence since its creation in 1947, while frequently exerting covert dominance over the political leadership during the remainder. The Establishment in Pakistan includes the key decision-makers in the country&#x27;s military and intelligence services, national security, as well as its foreign and domestic policies, including the state policies of aggressive Islamization during the military dictatorship of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. However, the military establishment later reversed its support of political Islam under General Pervez Musharraf, who pursued enlightened moderation in the 2000s.

Till 1990, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was the only major party of Pakistan. After Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto died, Benazir Bhutto took control and they remained a strong position throughout Pakistan. In 1990, Nawaz Sharif of Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) won the elections. Two major parties were in Pakistan. After IJI dissolved and Nawaz Sharif founded Pakistan Muslim League (N), PPP and PML(N) were the major two parties of Pakistan. In 1993, Peoples Party won the election again. In 1996, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf was formed. In 2013, PTI took part in the elections and won 35 seats in the National Assembly of Pakistan. After the 2018 Pakistan elections, PTI became the government and became one of the three major parties of Pakistan.

In 2020, Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was formed of many parties as a movement against then prime minister Imran Khan. Following Imran Khan’s removal, political unrest broke out throughout the country, and in the events leading up to the Pakistani 2024 election, many new parties were formed. The country’ largest party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, would be subject to legal issues, and an alleged crackdown and therefore was forced to register with their alliance member, the Sunni Ittehad Council, which is a minor religious party.

=== Punjab ===

Punjab is generally considered as the most important political province and has been used by major parties such as the PML(N) and PTI in the past to gain legitimacy and as a political stronghold. The Punjab provincial assembly has usually been split between the Pakistan Muslim League N (PML-N) and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).

=== Sindh ===

Sindh has been used as a political stronghold for the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) since the party’s creation. The PPP has almost always won landslide victories in provincial elections in Sindh, and has almost always held the province’s seats. Throughout the early 2000s the PML-Q saw minor successes in Sindh, but the province quickly came under the control of the PPP again. The PPP has been accused of bad governance by several Sindhi parties, leading to the creation of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), a coalition of several anti-PPP parties, although the PPP still holds sweeping majorities in Sindhi provincial seats.

=== Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) ===

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is full of Pashtun nationalist and regionalist parties favoring Afghan tribalism, such as the ANP and PMAP. The region has also been full of religious parties, like the JUI-F especially throughout the north western areas near Afghanistan. There are several political parties in KPK, and most of them favor Pashtun nationalism with feudal aspects, but ever since Imran Khan’s entrance into politics, the PTI has almost always won landslide election victories in the province and has KPK as a political stronghold and base of power.

=== Balochistan ===

The province of Balochistan, Pakistan is full of Baloch nationalist parties, with some demanding autonomy for Balochistan, and some extreme groups demanding secession from Pakistan. Most parties from Balochistan follow the same pattern as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, high levels of regionalism and ethnic nationalism, with most ethnic nationalists being left-wing, as well as right-wing religious groups usually gaining victories near the Afghan border. Balochistan is the only province in which no party regularly gains a clear majority, and the provincial assembly is usually split between Baloch nationalist parties.

=== Gilgit-Baltistan ===

The Pakistan Peoples Party won the first Gilgit-Baltistan elections and was the only major party of Gilgit-Baltistan with 20 seats out of 33. However, in 2015, Pakistan Muslim League (N) won 15 seats and became the major party of Gilgit-Baltistan and PPP only received one seat in the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly. However, in the 2020 elections, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) won 16 seats and became the only major party of Gilgit-Baltistan with PPP winning 3 and PML(N) winning two seats.

== Members of the Parliament ==
== Mainstream political parties ==

=== Pakistan Muslim League (N) ===
The Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz is a Pakistani conservative political party that was founded in 1993 by senior politician, Nawaz Sharif. The party was founded as an offshoot of the Pakistan Muslim League, but is now its largest faction. It is currently still led by its founder Nawaz Sharif and is ideologically conservative as well as shares similarities with Nawaz&#x27;s previous party, the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad. It saw rapid growth under Nawaz Sharif in the 1990s as it entered a two-party system with the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party. It is also advocates for economic privatization, as Nawaz himself was a business owner. The party follows a free market capitalist and economically liberalist approach. It has developed a somewhat ideology around its leader Nawaz Sharif and has been led by members of the Sharif family. It has been right-wing for most of its existence but has shifted to a center-right position in recent years. It holds is base of power in Punjab, more specifically Lahore and has had 3 different prime ministers including Nawaz himself who served for the longest non-consecutive time (9 years). The prime ministers from the PML-N include Nawaz Sharif (3 terms), Shahid Khaqan Abbasi (1 term) and Nawaz&#x27;s younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif (2 terms), who is serving right now.

=== Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ===

The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf is a political party founded in 1996 by cricketer-turned-politician, Imran Khan. The party was founded on the premise of bringing change to Pakistan and to bring a new face to Pakistani politics, as when the party was founded the PPP and PML-N ruled Pakistan in a &quot;de-facto&quot; two party system. It advocates for welfarism and has promoted turning Pakistan into a modern welfare state. It has often seen populism around Imran Khan, a former cricket star. It launched a large-scale anti-corruption campaign across Pakistan in the 2000s and 2010s which led to its victory in the 2018 Pakistani general election. It holds its base of power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but also holds significant popularity and influence across western Punjab, where Imran Khan is from. It has been widely seen as an anti-establishment party since 2022 as it clashed with Pakistan&#x27;s military establishment. It was founded as a centrist party. Besides this it has advocated for rule of law and constitutionalism as part of its political alliance, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayin. Despite being the largest political party in Pakistan in terms of membership, and in the top 10 largest parties worldwide, it has only had one prime minister, being Imran Khan himself who served for one term.

=== Pakistan People’s Party ===

The Pakistan People&#x27;s Party is a political party founded in 1967 by statesman, barrister and senior politician, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. It is by far the oldest out of the top ruling parties in Pakistan and was the first Pakistani political party to lay out a manifesto and ideology. It was founded on the premise of socialism and to struggle against the military rule of Field Marshal Ayub Khan (1958-1969). It has also been characterized as Pakistan&#x27;s first democratic party and has been left-wing for most of its existence with its founder, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto being a left-wing populist, though in the 21st century it has shifted to a center-left position. Zulfikar ruled Pakistan from 1971 until 1977, when he was overthrown and later hanged in 1979. The party has been widely seen as a dynastic political family party as it has seen its leadership pass down through the Bhutto family, which has seen a devoted cult of personality. After Zulfikar&#x27;s death the party abandoned its socialist ideology and instead shifted to progressivism under Zulfikar&#x27;s daughter, Benazir Bhutto. Benazir would be assassinated in 2007 and since then the party has been controlled by her husband, Asif Ali Zardari as well as her son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. The party has been rivals with the PML-N for most of its existence but has joined hands with the PML-N against the PTI. Its main base of power is Sindh. The PPP is led by the Central Executive Committee and has seen 4 different prime ministers including: Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1973-1977), Benazir Bhutto (1988-1990, 1993-1996), Yusuf Raza Gillani (2008-2012) and Raja Pervaiz Ashraf (2012-2013).

<text>Ashton-in-Makerfield is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, south of Wigan. As of the 2021 census, there was a population of 26,380.

Historically part of Lancashire, Ashton-in-Makerfield was a township in the parish of Newton-in-Makerfield (as Newton-le-Willows was once known), Winwick and hundred of West Derby. With neighbouring Haydock, Ashton-in-Makerfield was a chapelry, but the two were split in 1845. The place has long been a centre for the manufacture of locks and hinges, and it also sits on the Lancashire Coalfield, and was a coal mining district.

==History==
===Toponymy===

The name Ashton derives from Old English and means the &quot;farmstead where the ash-trees grow&quot;; it is a common name and is found locally in Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside and Ashton upon Mersey in Trafford. The town&#x27;s name was recorded as &quot;Eston&quot; in 1212. Later, the suffix &quot;in-Makerfield&quot; was added, which relates the name of the old district of Makerfield of which Ashton was a part; Makerfield derives from the Celtic for a wall or ruin and the Old English word &quot;feld&quot;, meaning &quot;open land&quot;.

===Religious history===

St Thomas&#x27; Church of England parish church on Warrington Road has ancient origins although the present building was completed in 1893. The graveyard is the resting place of many of the 189 victims of the Wood Pit explosion (at Haydock on Friday 7 June 1878), the worst coal-mining disaster in Lancashire at the time.

Hope Church on Heath Road was founded by Protestants from St Thomas&#x27; opposed to the High Church ideals brought in by a new Vicar in the 1870s. His introduction of Anglo-Catholic worship caused riots on Gerard Street and he was initially evicted from the town by a mob of miners. He returned backed by troops from Liverpool. Banned from worshipping in the form they had previously done, many left and continued a simpler form of worship in a barn off Ashton Heath. Word of their plight reached a Miss Catherine Cave-Browne in London who sent money for a Protestant Mission to be built. The church was built with the official title of Cave-Browne Protestant Institute (Christchurch).

Park Lane Chapel (see Unitarianism), Wigan Road, Bryn, dates back to 1697, although its congregation was founded in 1662. It is the oldest non-conformist chapel and congregation in the district. By the 19th century Park Lane was only one of nine non-conformist chapels in the area. There was a Baptist, Congregational church (Hilton Street), Evangelical (Heath Road), Independent, Independent Methodist (Downall Green Road), Primitive Methodist, Welsh Wesleyan Methodist and English Wesleyan Methodist chapel.

The Catholic Church of St Oswald and St Edmund Arrowsmith, on Liverpool Road was completed in 1930, replacing an earlier Catholic church on the site which was built in 1822. It houses the hand of St Edmund Arrowsmith (1585–1628).

===Coal mining and heavy industry===

Ashton-in-Makerfield was part of the St. Helens Area of the South Lancashire Coalfield. The St Helens Area lay to the South West of the Wigan area and occupied around , skirting Wigan, Warrington, Widnes and to within eight miles (13 km) of Liverpool.
In 1867 there were 13 collieries in the district of Ashton-in-Makerfield. Others followed including Bryn Hall Colliery, owned by Edward Frederick Crippin, the Mains and Park Lane Collieries. Park Colliery and some of those open in 1867 (e.g. Garswood Hall) remained productive until the 1950s.

A number of Ashton&#x27;s coal miners made a significant impact on modern British history, including: Stephen Walsh M.P.; William Kenealy, V.C. and Lance-Corporal in the 1st Lancashire Fusiliers; and Joe Gormley, President of the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the late 19th century, the district was described by one observer as having &quot;extensive collieries, cotton mills and potteries&quot;, and famed for the manufacture of &quot;hinges, locks, files and nails&quot;. Mills such as the Record Mill (Spinning), situated in York Road, and the Makerfield Mill (the &#x27;Weaving Shed&#x27;), in Windsor Road, took over from home-working. Similarly, Thomas Crompton &amp; Sons in Gerard Street, which would eventually employ around 1,200 workers, superseded the subcontracting system that sustained substantial numbers of locally based blacksmiths and other craftsmen.

As recently as the 1970s the district of Ashton-in-Makerfield had one of the highest proportions of derelict land, mainly in the form of spoil tips, left over from coal mining. Major land reclamation schemes have since completely transformed the area.

==Governance==

Before 1894 Ashton-in-Makerfield was a township in the parish of Winwick, part of the West Derby Hundred of Lancashire. By an Act in 1845 and the division of the Parish of Winwick, Holy Trinity Church, Downall Green, was made the principal parish church and St. Thomas&#x27; made a parish church in the same Act, both being part of the Diocese of Liverpool. By the Local Government Act 1894 Ashton-in-Makerfield was made an urban district.
In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the district was abolished, with the area split administratively. The Seneley Green Parish, containing Garswood, Pewfall and Downall Green, falling now within the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens in the newly created Merseyside, and the rest now being administered by the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan in the newly created Greater Manchester. Ashton-in-Makerfield Town Hall was demolished in 2017.

The section of Ashton-in-Makerfield within the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan creates the Bryn &amp; Ashton Township, consisting of the six &#x27;neighbourhoods&#x27; of Bryn, Ashton, Ashton Heath, Landgate, Stubshaw Cross and Town Green, and one of the ten areas into which Wigan Metropolitan Borough has been divided for consultation purposes. Each township has a forum, with some influence over the provision of municipal services.

==Railway transport==

Ashton-in-Makerfield railway station, which was situated off Lodge Lane in neighbouring Haydock, opened in 1900 as part of the Great Central Railway and closed in 1952.

Today the town is now served by stations in nearby Garswood and Bryn stations, both on the line between Wigan North Western and Liverpool Lime Street.

==Demography==

===Population change===
==Present day==
A market is held on the market square off Garswood Street on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

Ashton&#x27;s local semi-pro football clubs are Ashton Athletic F.C. and Ashton Town A.F.C.. Garswood United F.C. is also nearby.

The town is the inspiration of the fictional town of Ashton in the TV series and popular children’s books Horrid Henry.

Crompton&#x27;s, the hinge and fasteners making factory in Ashton-in-Makerfield, has closed and is now demolished. A shopping centre called the Gerard Centre now stands in its place.

The Hingemaker&#x27;s Arms public house, on Heath Road, is the only one in the world known to carry that name. It was run by the Corless family for decades until Walter Corless&#x27; retirement in 2006, however Walter can still be seen pulling pints at the weekend. The Hinge, as it is known by its clientele, is now owned and operated by a consortium of local businessmen.

The site now occupied by Byrchall and St Edmund Arrowsmith high schools was the location of a Second World War POW camp, Camp 50.

Ashton-in-Makerfield has three secondary schools: Cansfield High School; Byrchall High School and St Edmund Arrowsmith Catholic High School.

In November 2008, Wigan council released proposals to merge Cansfield High and Byrchall High into one school. These proposals were refused, and the schools remain separate, with Cansfield situated near to Bryn and Byrchall near to Haydock, neighbouring St Edmund Arrowsmith.

In 2021, it was announced that Byrchall had been selected to be 1 of 50 schools chosen across the UK to be rebuilt. The new build will be situated on the front field, and will feature facilities such as a performing arts wing, which the old school did not have. This is an update that has been long awaited, as the school is believed to have stayed almost identical to when it first opened in 1978, after moving from the grounds of Ashton Grammar School, which was founded in 1588, over 4 centuries ago. In 2007, the school was announced to be a specialist Maths and Computing College, increasing student admissions and increasing the population of the school, hence the decision to rebuild, as the current build is believed to be too small for purpose at this point in time.

==Media==

<text>The Pakistan Muslim League (; known as PML), is the name of several different Pakistani political parties that have dominated the centre-right platform in the country.

The &quot;Muslim League&quot; (the original successor of the All-India Muslim League) was the party of Pakistan&#x27;s founders. However, it faced multiple fractures soon after Pakistan gained independence in 1947. It vanished in the 1970s. Its revival began in the mid-1980s and today several parties in Pakistan are named Muslim League.

==History==
===First phase (1962–1969)===

The first &quot;Pakistan&quot; Muslim League was founded by President Ayub Khan in 1962 as a successor to the original Muslim League. Just a short period after its foundation, the party broke into two factions: Convention Muslim League that supported the President and the new Constitution, and the Council Muslim League, that opposed the new Constitution, denouncing it as undemocratic that made the Presidency an autocratic position. Following President Ayub&#x27;s resignation, Nurul Amin, a right-wing political veteran, attempted to reunite the factions of Pakistan Muslim League. His efforts were supported by some, while opposed by others. Before the 1970 Elections, a senior leader of Council Muslim League, Abdul Qayyum Khan formed his own variant of the Muslim League that opposed cooperation with a party that once supported a Dictator. In 1973, Amin&#x27;s efforts succeeded and the Functional Muslim League (PML-F) was founded.

===Second phase (1969–1977)===
After the resignation of President Ayub Khan, Pakistan Muslim League once again united under the leadership of the conservative political veteran, Nurul Amin. Although they were closer ideologically, they were not ready to accept each other&#x27;s domination. This is the reason that they competed against each other in 1970 elections.
Following the death of Nurul Amin, the PML went into political abyss but made its notable comeback in a direct response to nationalization and the outgrowth of leftism in the country under the Bhutto administration. In the 1970s, the PML led by Pir Pagara was benefited with the financial support of industrialists, including Nawaz Sharif and Shujat Hussain, and intelligentsia that included lawyers, Fida Mohammad and Javed Hashmi.
Efforts of Pir Pagara assimilated of majority of the factions of the Pakistan Muslim League, in a bid to mount a strong opposition to the leftist Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in the 1970s. It may be noted that all factions will continue to hold their individual identities, as the PML was treated as a platform for parties to come together.

===Third phase (1977–1985)===
When Pakistan went into martial law in 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq took power after overthrowing the Bhutto government. In 1985, after the election, Zia appointed Muhammad Khan Junejo as the new Prime Minister. Junejo, with a large group of pro-Zia conservatives founded an entirely new party by the name of Pakistan Muslim League. Junejo however soon started to lose the support of party due to his opposition to Zia. Meanwhile, other influential politicians like Nawaz Sharif and Fida Mohammad Khan started to gain power.

After the Death of Zia-ul-Haq in 1988, democracy returned and new 1988 Pakistani general election elections were supposed to be held. Junejo split away from the party and formed Pakistan Muslim League (J). Meanwhile, Fida became the party chairman and Sharif the General-Secretary. Pakistan Muslim League allied with Jamaat-e-Islami and other right-wing parties to form the Islamic Democratic Alliance against the left-wing PPP. This event marked the end of the Pakistan Muslim League.

The Pakistan Muslim League formally dissolved alongside other parties following the 1977 Martial Law, though it supported it. However, it was restored in 1985, when General Zia organised his supporters into a formal party under the leadership of Muhammad Khan Junejo. In 1988, Zia dismissed Junejo and the party split between Pakistan Muslim League (N) and Pakistan Muslim League (J). In 1990, after Zia&#x27;s death, Pakistan Muslim League came under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif and joined the Islamic Democratic Alliance. In 1993, after the Alliance has been dissolved. After the 1999 Coup, PML-N went into a temporary decline and three new factions of Pakistan Muslim League were founded: Anti-Musharraf PML (Zia), Pro-Musharraf conservative Awami Muslim League and Pro-Musharraf liberal Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q).

In 2004, the PML-Q and the PML-F briefly reunited as the Pakistan Muslim League. However, the reunion was unsuccessful and within few days, both the parties went off in separate directions once again.

<text>The University of Passau (&quot;Universität Passau&quot; in German) is a public research university located in Passau, Lower Bavaria, Germany. Founded in 1973, it is the youngest university in Bavaria and consequently has the most modern campus in the state. Nevertheless, its roots as the Institute for Catholic Studies dates back to the early 17th century.

Today it is home to four faculties and 39 different undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes.

==History==

The university was established on 1 January 1973 by a resolution of the Bayerischer Landtag (Bavarian State Parliament). However its history goes back to 1622 when an Institute for Catholic Studies was incorporated into the Gymnasium founded by Fürst Leopold in 1612. In 1773, the school was renamed &quot;fürstbischöfliche Akademie&quot;, highlighting its relationship to the bishop. Nevertheless, in 1803 it was downgraded to a &quot;kurfürstliches Lyzeum&quot;, which meant a loss of status. After a period of abandonment, it was re-established as &quot;Passauer Lyzeum&quot;.

This lyceum grew over the years until it became a philosophical-theological university in 1923. Under the Nazi regime the university was forced to change its logo, but in 1950 a new seal was introduced, representing Mary with The Child Jesus vanquishing evil. The strong religious symbolism of this logo was considered inappropriate for the new university and replaced with a neutral logo. In 1969, the city council initiated negotiations to establish a university out of the old Faculty.

==Campus==

The campus of the University of Passau is probably unique in Germany. With the exception of the Department of Catholic Theology, which is in the Old Town, and a number of offices in the city centre, all faculties are situated on a single campus along a single street. This is advantageous for the internal communication of students and staff, particularly because the university offers many interdisciplinary courses. Hence, it is not uncommon for law courses to be held in the Philosophicum (Arts and Humanities building) and vice versa. The campus is stretched out along the left bank of the Inn river, making it an idyllic place to study. The gardens and meadows are very popular with students in the summer.
The Nikolakloster building is the oldest building on campus, existing long before the university was established. It is also the only building that breaks with the university&#x27;s otherwise modern architecture. Today, this former convent is home to the language centre. On the opposite end of the campus are the IT Centre (ITZ) building and the sports grounds. The latest addition to the campus, inaugurated in 2014, is the Centre for Media and Communication, which houses a state-of-the-art newsroom.

The university&#x27;s sports facilities include four gymnasiums, a football pitch and an athletics field with a race track.

A wide range of sports courses are offered throughout the semester and are free to staff and students, including football, volleyball, basketball, rowing, martial arts and aerobics.

The University of Passau has an award-winning refectory with a seating capacity of 560. The campus additionally has four cafeterias, which offer sandwiches, confectionery, coffee, soft drinks and – this being Bavaria – beer.

The university&#x27;s crèche is open to children of students and staff. It is unusual for a German university to have day care facilities, but the reasonably-priced service is well used by students with toddlers aged 1 to 3.

===Library===
The library was established together with the university in 1978 and opened its doors to students and citizens of Passau the same year. The central library is the main library of the university and, together with the five faculty and institute libraries, constitutes the university&#x27;s library system. Its Director is Dr Steffen Wawra. The university library currently has two million books and 3,050 journals. There are a total of 1,000 desk spaces for library users in the reading rooms, which are open 16 hours a day.

==Organisation==

===Governance===
The University Executive consists of the President, Professor Ulrich Bartosch, four Vice Presidents – Professors Christina Hansen (International Affairs and Diversity), Robert Obermaier (Research), Bettina Noltenius (Studies, Teaching and Ethics), Harald Kosch (Academic Infrastructure and IT Facilities) – as well as the Commissioner for System Accreditation and Internal Integration with the Cross-Functional Task of Sustainability, Professor Werner Gamerith, Head of Administration, Dr Achim Dilling and the Deputy Head of Administration, Mr Thomas Werrlein.

The Senate is the legislative branch of the university. The president and vice presidents are senators &quot;ex officio&quot;, as are the deans of the faculties and the university&#x27;s gender equality officer.

===Faculties===
The University of Passau has four faculties: Law; Business, Economics and Information Systems; Arts and Humanities; and Computer Science and Mathematics.

In 2010 the Department of Catholic Theology and the Chair of Philosophy became inactive for a planned 15 years, a highly controversial decision, as the academic staff of the faculty had received numerous awards in recognition of their research achievements. The Department of Catholic Theology now offers catholic religious education as a specialisation for students enrolled in one of the teacher training programmes or the M.A. programme in Caritas Science.

==Partnerships==
The University of Passau is well-known beyond the borders of Bavaria and Germany for its international orientation and atmosphere. The university maintains co-operative partnerships with some 236 foreign universities in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia, enabling students enrolled at the university to spend part of their studies abroad. The partner universities include King&#x27;s College and the University of Stirling in the UK, the Autonomous University of Barcelona and Autonomous University of Madrid in Spain, Lund University in Sweden, Texas A&amp;M University and Augustana College in the United States, the Universidad del Salvador in Argentina, the University of Santiago, Chile, the Université Laval in Canada, Kyoto Sangyo University in Japan, Zhejiang International Studies University and Beijing Foreign Studies University in China, Thammasat University and University Chiang Mai in Thailand, Universitas Indonesia in Indonesia as well as the National University of Vietnam, the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Pakistan, the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in India and Amirkabir University of Technology in Iran.

== Rankings ==

In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings of 2024, the university is placed at 401-500th globally and 37-41st within the country.

==Student life==

===Student associations===

The university supports a number of student groups in various fields of interest. Among them are eight political groups, two drama societies, three university orchestras, two choirs, several NGO’s groups such as Amnesty International, Unicef and AIESEC, several departments of specialised European student organisations such as Young European Federalists, AEGEE and ELSA, five societies dedicated to fostering international relations and cultural exchange, several subject-orientated groups, an association of cultural studies students, a debating society, a student-run management consulting group, and three religious student groups.

===Sports===
Despite the wide range of sports offered in the Sports Center of the university, there are only two teams that play at a competitive level. However, it should be kept in mind that unlike other countries, Germany does not have a long tradition of inter-university sporting competitions.
* American Football – Passau Red Wolves
* Lacrosse Passau

===Fraternities===
Fraternities have a long-standing tradition in Germany&#x27;s student life, although the usage of the word carries very different connotations from that in the United States. German student fraternities are traditionally linked to nationalism, sometimes combined with old-fashioned social and religious views. Such societies are usually male and involve dressing up in traditional 19th Century outfits, as well as drinking and fighting with swords. Due to controversies around some fraternities&#x27; attitudes to race, history and German identity, fraternities are a contentious issue among students. There are five fraternities in Passau:
* Corps Budissa Leipzig
* K.St.V. Boiotro (affiliated with the &quot;Kartellverband katholischer deutscher Studentenvereine&quot;)
* Burschenschaft Hanseatia
* Akad. Burschenschaft Markomannia Wien (affiliated with the &quot;Deutsche Burschenschaft&quot;)
* K.D.St.V. Oeno-Danubia im (affiliated with the &quot;Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen&quot;)

===Traditions===
A tradition for first-year students in Passau is a welcome reception in the refectory with typical Bavarian foods: Leberkäse, Bavarian Pretzels (which are different from the American ones) and beer. The welcome speeches are held by the president of the university and the mayor of Passau.

Another traditional part of Passau&#x27;s student life are the Orientation Weeks, intended to acquaint new students with Passau and its university. During those weeks students are offered guided tours of the university, libraries, the city and of course the bars and clubs.

<doc id="409093" wikidata="Q1202292" url="?curid=409093" title="Griffith University">
<text>Griffith University is a public research university in South East Queensland on the east coast of Australia. The university was founded in 1971, but was not officially opened until 1975. Griffith University is credited with introducing Australia&#x27;s first degrees in environmental science and Asian studies. The university has five campuses, at Gold Coast, Nathan, Logan, South Bank, and Mount Gravatt. A sixth campus, to be located at the Treasury Building in the Brisbane CBD, will open in 2027. The university was named after Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, who was twice Premier of Queensland and the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. Sir Samuel Griffith played a major role in the Federation of Australia and was the principal author of the Australian Constitution.

The university offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and research programs across a range of disciplines, including business, law, science, health, education, engineering, and the arts.

Griffith University was originally opened in Nathan, Queensland, as a single campus of 451 students, but has expanded to include five campuses in three cities, the largest of which is the Gold Coast campus at Southport and the Nathan campus in Brisbane. The Mount Gravatt and South Bank campuses are also located in Brisbane, while the Logan campus is at Meadowbrook.

Griffith University, with about 50,000 students enrolled from more than 130 countries, is a verdant university and a member of the IRU. According to the 2021 Student Experience Survey, it has the ninth-highest student satisfaction rating among all Australian universities and, since 2012, has received more Australian Awards for University Teaching than any other Australian university. 

==History==

===Beginning===
In 1965, of natural bushland at Nathan was set aside for a new university campus. Initially, the site was to be part of the University of Queensland, which was experiencing strong demand in humanities and social sciences. By 1970, a new tertiary institution was being mooted, and Theodor Bray (later Sir Theodor Bray) was asked by the Queensland Government to establish a second for Brisbane and the third for the state.

After several months of discussion, the government announced on 24 December 1970 that Bray would head a committee charged with establishing Griffith University. 

On 30 September 1971, the Queensland Government officially created and recognised Griffith University with the passing of the &quot;Assent to Griffith University Act 1971&quot;. On 5 March 1975, Griffith University began teaching 451 students in four schools: Australian Environmental Studies, Humanities, Modern Asian Studies, and Science.

===Expansion===
In the 1990s, the Dawkins Revolution saw several tertiary education reforms in Australia, resulting in a series of amalgamations of colleges and universities. In 1990, the Mount Gravatt Teachers College (est. 1969) and Gold Coast College of Advanced Education (est. 1987) became official campuses of Griffith University, remaining in the same location today. The Queensland Conservatorium of Music continued the higher education mergers and became an official part of Griffith University in 1991. Originally established in 1957, the new entity became known as Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University. In 1992, Griffith&#x27;s amalgamations were completed with the Queensland College of Art (QCA), established in 1881 and recognised as the oldest continuously operating art training institution in Australia, officially becoming part of the university.

Griffith&#x27;s fifth campus, Logan, opened in 1998. Located in the suburb of Meadowbrook, on an area of green fields south of Brisbane, the Logan campus was established to specifically address the interests and needs of the Logan City area.

Griffith University was an official Partner of the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games. Over 500 students and staff were closely involved in the planning and delivery of the event.

==Campuses==
Griffith University&#x27;s campuses are distinctive for their nature-based settings within urban environments. 

===Gold Coast campus===
The Gold Coast campus is located in the Gold Coast suburb of Southport. Set in native bushland, on the land of the Aboriginal Yugambeh and Kombumerri peoples, this campus hosts over 19,000 students.

The campus opened the Griffith Health Centre and the neighbouring Gold Coast University Hospital in 2013, and opened the Griffith Business School building in 2014. The campus is serviced by two Gold Coast light rail () stations and is a major interchange for bus routes.

===Logan campus===
Hosting approximately 2,000 students, Logan campus offers degrees in human services and social work, nursing and midwifery, business, and education.

===Nathan campus===
Nathan, Griffith&#x27;s foundation campus, is situated on the edge of Toohey Forest approximately 10 kilometres from the Brisbane CBD. Nathan hosts over 13,000 students and offers degrees in business and government, engineering and information technology, environment, humanities and languages, law, and science and aviation.

The buildings at the Nathan campus were designed to fit into the environment by Roger Kirk Johnson, the founding architectural designer of the campus, following the slope of the land and using architectural means of cooling. The library building was designed by Robin Gibson and won the first national award for library design. The clusters of buildings, sports facilities, bushland reserves, and recreational areas are connected by integrated networks of walking paths. On the northern edge of the campus lies the Dunn Memorial.

In 2013, the six-star, green-rated Sir Samuel Griffith Centre was opened on the Nathan campus. The building operates off the grid and is powered by a combination of photovoltaics and hydrogen. The campus has two residential colleges for students and a range of sporting facilities.

===Mount Gravatt campus===

The Mount Gravatt campus, adjacent to the Nathan campus, hosts 4,400 students. It is the university&#x27;s social sciences and humanities hub and the base for research into crucial social issues, including education and suicide prevention. The campus is situated on the edge of Toohey Forest. The campus includes an aquatic and fitness centre, with a heated pool and indoor and outdoor recreation areas, co-located with a 16-court tennis centre, a training oval, and basketball and netball courts. On-campus student accommodation is also available.

===South Bank campus===
Located in Brisbane&#x27;s cultural precinct, the South Bank campus is Griffith University&#x27;s creative hub. It encompasses Griffith&#x27;s Queensland College of Art and Queensland Conservatorium, the Griffith Film School and the Griffith University Art Museum and Ship Inn. , enrolment for all four units is about 3,400 students.

=== Future Brisbane City campus ===
On 6 September 2024, Griffith University announced that they would be purchasing the historic Treasury Building in Brisbane, and converting it into the university’s sixth teaching campus, which will open in 2027. The new campus will accommodate students and staff from the Schools of Business, IT and Law, and will also serve as a centre for “postgraduate and executive education”.

<text>Vilshofen an der Donau is the largest city in the southeast of Bavaria, Germany in the district of Passau. Until 1972, the town was the district seat of the district of Vilshofen.

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===
The year 776 was the beginning of the documented history of Vilshofen. When a farm was donated to the Mondsee monastery (Salzkammergut), Vilusa (name of the farm) was mentioned for the first time. In the 12th century, the form of the name Vilshouen existed. Bishop of Passau was landlord of the Danube and Vils. Vilshofen was held by the Count of Ortenburg as a fief. In 1206, Vilshofen was elevated to a town by Count Heinrich I of Ortenburg. In 1220, there are already reports of a bridge over the Vils, which connects the new city area with the old settlement on the right bank of the Vils (today Vilsvorstadt). In 1236, Hainricus Plebanus de Vilshouen is mentioned as a pastor with a parish church.

In 1241, the town was taken over by Duke Otto II of Bavaria by force after an inheritance disputes in the House of Ortenburg. Therefore, it became a border town between the Duchy of Bavaria and the Prince-Bishopric of Passau. The &quot;Vilshofener Zollhaus&quot;, can be found on the banks of the Danube. In 1258, Vilshofen became the center of a ducal nursing court. In 1262, the city finally passed to Bavaria after Duke Henry of Lower Bavaria, the successor of Otto II, negotiated a treaty with Bishop Rüdiger of Passau after lengthy negotiations. In 1345, Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian confirmed the town charter. In 1376, the collegiate monastery of Vilshofen was founded. In 1434, the oldest city seal was created with a raised quatrefoil with an angel as a shield holder and with the city coat of arms in a semicircular shield. In 1504, the town was successfully defended against the attacking Palatinates and Bohemia in the Landshut War of Succession. In 1536, 36 houses were destroyed by a large city fire.

== Geography ==
=== Rivers ===
Vilshofen an der Donau is located at the confluence of the stream Vils, Pfudrach and Wolfach, south of the Bavarian Forest, a good 20 kilometers upstream of Passau. Due to these streams flowing into the Danube, the city is also called the three-river city, while the city of Passau serves as a model. The north–south extension of the urban area is about 6 km and the east–west extension about 10 km. The elevation above sea level ranges from 309 to 457 m above sea level.

=== Geomorphology and Geology ===
The village is located directly at the mouth of the Vils into the Danube. The Danube cut into the crystalline basement here during the uplift of the Bavarian Forest in the Late Tertiary and Quaternary. The result was the formation of an antecedent breakthrough valley. In this case, the river actively cuts into the rising mountain body, keeping pace with the tectonic uplift. The Danube thus created an impressive river valley from Vilshofen far beyond Passau. The depth of the breakthrough valley in the Passau area is about 100 meters and rises to up to 180 meters (Schlögener Schlinge, Upper Austria). Granite was mined in the Vils-Engtal nature reserve, which was stopped in the middle of the 20th century for economic reasons. The quarries were left to nature and partly flooded, so for example the Taferlsee was created, which can now be found in a natural environment and is an impressive example of anthropogenetic geomorphology.

=== Climate ===
The city area is located at 48° north latitude. As a result, the city is predominantly under the influence of air currents from the west. As can be seen from the climatic diagram, Vilshofen can be assigned to the cool temperate climate. There is also a continental impact and is characterized by sometimes very cold and snowy winters and hot and dry summers. The occurrence of heat thunderstorms is also present in the summer time.

The driest months are October and November with about 50 mm of precipitation. The occurrence of an Indian summer is therefore given annually and leads to mild temperatures in the late year.

Due to its location in the Danube plain at the confluence of the two rivers Danube and Vils, fog and high fog often form, especially in spring and autumn. The balancing influence on climate fluctuations, especially in winter, is also noticeable in Vilshofen in the fact that it is always 1–2 °C warmer in the urban area than in districts that are further away from the rivers due to the Danube and Vils rivers.

=== Neighboring Municipalities ===
The municipalities of Aidenbach, Aldersbach, Beutelsbach, Künzing, Windorf, Ortenburg, Hofkirchen and Fürstenzell and the independent city of Passau border directly on the city area.

==Demographics==

Religion

The population of Vilshofen is predominantly Christian. In Vilshofen there is a Catholic Church, a Protestant Church and a new Apostolic Church. 63% identify as Catholic, 7% as Protestant and 30% have no or other religious affiliation. There are two Roman Catholic parishes in the city area, in addition to the parish of St. John the Baptist in Vilshofen and the parish of Sandbach. Both belong to the Deanery of Vilshofen and the Diocese of Passau. There is also the Benedictine monastery of Schweiklberg, which was only founded in 1904.

The Protestant parish celebrates its services in the Church of the Redeemer, which was built in 1937. The New Apostolic Church was completed in 1969.
==Politics==
The town council (24 seats) is composed since the 2020 Mayoral Election as follows:

With respect to 2014, the SPD gained two more seats, and for the first time AfD and FHB got a seat.

The voter affluence was 58.02%

Mayor

The first mayor is Florian Gams (SPD), who was elected in the run-off election on 30 March 2014 in the 2014 municipal election with 50.5% of the valid votes, after he had received only 23.36% in the first round of voting against the incumbent Georg Krenn (47.02%). Gams was confirmed in office for another six years on 15 March 2020 with 72.06% of the votes.

Georg Krenn was the successor to Mayor Hans Gschwendtner, who was First Mayor of the city from 1990 to 2008.

<text>Vegan organic (or veganic) agriculture is the organic production of food and other crops with minimal animal inputs. Vegan organic agriculture is the organic form of animal-free agriculture.

Animal-free farming methods use no animal products or by-products, such as bloodmeal, fish products, bone meal, feces, or other animal-origin matter because the production of these materials is viewed as either harming animals directly, or as associated with the exploitation and consequent suffering of animals. Some of these materials are by-products of animal husbandry, created during the process of cultivating animals for the production of meat, milk, skins, furs, entertainment, labor, or companionship. The sale of such by-products decreases expenses and increases profit for those engaged in animal husbandry and therefore helps support the animal husbandry industry, an outcome most vegans find unacceptable.

Vegan organic farming is much less common than organic farming. In 2019, there were 63 self-declared vegan organic farms in the United States, and 16,585 certified organic farms.

==Veganic gardening==
The veganic gardening method is a distinct system developed by Rosa Dalziel O&#x27;Brien, Kenneth Dalziel O&#x27;Brien and May E. Bruce, although the term was originally coined by Geoffrey Rudd as a contraction of &quot;vegetable organic&quot; in order to &quot;denote a clear distinction between conventional chemical-based systems and organic ones based on animal manures&quot;. The O&#x27;Brien system&#x27;s principal argument is that animal manures are harmful to soil health rather than that their use involves exploitation of and cruelty to animals.

The system employs very specific techniques including the addition of straw and other vegetable wastes to the soil in order to maintain soil fertility. Gardeners following the system use soil-covering mulches, and employ non-compacting surface cultivation techniques using any short-handled, wide-bladed, hand hoe. They kneel when surface cultivating, placing a board under their knees to spread out the pressure, and prevent soil compaction. Kenneth Dalziel O&#x27;Brien published a description of his system in &quot;Veganic Gardening, the Alternative System for Healthier Crops&quot;:

Before the term veganic was created, economist and simple living advocate Scott Nearing gave a speech at the 1953 World Vegetarian Congress in Sigtuna, Sweden, with a title of &quot;Food without Animal Residues&quot;.

==Practices==
Vegan organic growers maintain soil fertility using green manures, cover crops, green wastes, composted vegetable matter, and minerals. Some vegan gardeners may supplement this with human urine from vegans (which provides nitrogen) and &#x27;humanure&#x27; from vegans, produced from compost toilets.

Farms certified as &quot;biocyclic vegan&quot; use preventative methods to manage insects. If these fail, however, the label allows them to use insecticides such as &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;,&quot;&quot; which starves larvae to death.

== Certification and promotion ==
The &quot;Biocyclic Vegan Standard&quot; is an IFOAM-accredited organic standard for vegan organic farms. It is awarded by BNS Biocyclic Network Services Ltd (a Cypriot company), and has accredited 21 farms in Europe . The German Environment Agency awarded the German &quot;biocyclic vegan&quot; association some 60,000 euros for the promotion of the &quot;biocyclic vegan&quot; standard from 2021 to 2022.

, 19 farms in the United Kingdom and Ireland are certified vegan organic by the &quot;Stockfree Organic&quot; label. Farms wanting to obtain the label are certified by the Soil Association, and the label&#x27;s requirements are determined by the Vegan Organic Network.

<doc id="409106" wikidata="Q7679026" url="?curid=409106" title="Talbot Hobbs">
<text>Lieutenant General Sir Joseph John Talbot Hobbs, (24 August 1864 – 21 April 1938) was an Australian architect and First World War general.

==Early life==
Hobbs was born in London, the son of Joseph and his wife Frances Ann Hobbs (née Wilson). Educated at St Mary&#x27;s church school, Merton, Surrey, Hobbs joined the volunteer artillery in 1883. He also worked as draughtsman for a builder, John Hurst. In 1886, he emigrated with Hurst to Western Australia and established an architectural practice in Perth in 1887.

Hobbs designed many of the well known public buildings in Perth and Fremantle, including the Weld Club, the Savoy Hotel and the Perth Masonic Lodge. Hobbs was treasurer of the Western Australian Institute of Architects in 1896, and later became the institute&#x27;s president from 1909 to 1911. From 1905, he was senior partner in the firm of architects, Hobbs, Smith &amp; Forbes.

Hobbs also designed a number of private residences. The first of these is believed to be Samson House in Fremantle, an example of late 19th century colonial style, which was built in two stages between 1888 and 1890. The house is registered with the National Trust, and is in the Register of the National Estate.

==Military career==
In 1887, Hobbs joined the volunteer artillery in Perth as a gunner, was commissioned in 1889, and rose to the command of the 1st (Western Australian) Field Battery in 1903. In 1906 he was a lieutenant colonel commanding a Western Australian mixed brigade, and in 1913 a colonel commanding the 22nd Infantry Brigade. On four occasions he went to England and did intensive courses in artillery training with the British Army. He was thus thoroughly equipped when war broke out and, on 8 August 1914 was selected by Major General William Bridges to command the 1st Australian Divisional Artillery.

After training in Egypt, he was at the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 and was soon ashore searching for positions for his guns. Hobbs clashed with Bridges over the placement of the guns. Hobbs was in command of the artillery until 9 November 1915 when he was struck down with dysentery and invalided to Cairo despite his protests.

Hobbs was then promoted brigadier general and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). In March 1916 he went with the 1st Australian Division to France, and was in command of the Australian artillery when Pozières was captured. In December 1916 he assumed command of the 5th Australian Division and was made a major general in January. This division was in the thick of the fighting in the spring of 1917, and in September distinguished itself at Polygon Wood. The staff worked well together, and achieved a great victory. Hobbs was created both a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) and Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) on 1 January 1918. At the end of April his division fought at the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, which probably contributed to the abandonment of the German operations towards Amiens.

Towards the end of May, Lieutenant General Sir John Monash was placed in command of the Australian Corps, and Hobbs became the senior divisional commander in the corps. His division was then given a well-earned rest but took a share in the great counterattack which began on 8 August. It did not take a leading part in the capture of Mont St Quentin, but Monash, in his &quot;The Australian Victories in France&quot;, stated that he was &quot;concerned ... that the fine performance of the Fifth Division should not be underrated. The circumstances under which general Hobbs was called upon to intervene in the battle, at very short notice, imposed upon him, personally, difficulties of no mean order&quot;. One of his tasks it may be mentioned was the crossing of the Somme in the face of strong opposition, and when Hobbs sent a message to the men of his war-worn division on its beginning a rest period on 8 September, he was able to say that they had &quot;earned imperishable fame for their gallantry and valour&quot;. It was but a short rest, for they were in the line again later on in the same month, and Hobbs was making careful plans for the attack on the Hindenburg Line which was successfully breached by the 3rd and 5th divisions on 30 September and 1 October. The war ended just a few weeks later due to the armistice of 11 November 1918.

Monash was put in charge of the repatriation and demobilisation of the Australian troops, and Hobbs succeeded him in the command of the Australian Corps until May 1919.

==Post-war==
After the Armistice, Hobbs decided to return to his former profession; architecture. With a keen interest in the construction of war memorials, Hobbs was responsible for designing the Western Australian War Memorial in Kings Park, Perth, St George&#x27;s College, Crawley and the Temperance and General and Royal Insurance buildings.

Hobbs died at sea of a heart attack while en route to the unveiling of the Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial. His body was returned from Colombo to Perth where he was given a military and state burial.

==Legacy==

Hobbs was a short and slight man, whose civilian life was that of a successful citizen who had a full realisation of his responsibilities to the society of which he was a member. Hobbs was capable, self-sacrificing and measured his life by high standards. Monash said of Hobbs that he &quot;succeeded fully as the Commander of a Division by his sound common sense and his sane attitude towards every problem that confronted him&quot;. The eulogy of Lieutenant General Sir Brudenell White was &quot;he was not only a soldier, he was also a great citizen, and a great Christian gentleman ... who knew none other than the straight path&quot;.

The &quot;Lieut. General Sir J. J. Talbot Hobbs Memorial&quot;, better known as the &quot;Talbot Hobbs memorial&quot;, was proposed and constructed just prior to the Second World War. The memorial is made of Donnybrook stone with a bronze bust of Hobbs on top, and placed against a background of Canary Island Palms on the Perth Esplanade. Since it was built the memorial has been the receiving point for the salute during Anzac Day parade, it was also the location from where Queen Elizabeth II took the salute during the 1954 Royal visit. The memorial was placed on the Western Australian Heritage register on 18 March 2005.

The memorial was moved in 2014 from the Perth Esplanade to the Supreme Court Gardens as part of works to create Elizabeth Quay.

<text>The political parties of [[Chile]] are three clearly categorized, distinct, political groups: the left-wing, the center and the right-wing. Before the 1973 coup, these three political groups were moderately pluralistic and fragmented.

This distinction has existed since the end of the 19th century. Since then, the three groups have been made up of different parties. Each party has had some amount of power in the management of the State or has been represented in the National Congress.

Political parties are recognized legally and formally by Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile of 1980 and by the Organic Constitutional Law of Political Parties of 1987 as organizations that participate in the legal political system and contribute to guiding public opinion.

== History of Chile&#x27;s political parties ==
=== Origins and the first blocks (1810–1860) ===
In Chile, the first political groups were created during the Independence of Chile: the Royalists and the Patriots. The Royalists wanted to maintain the status quo with the King of Spain, while the Patriots wanted to gain a larger degree of freedom. In turn, the Patriots further split into the Moderates, who wanted a slow pace of reform, and the Radicals or Extremists, who favored a much faster pace. All of the early political groups were shy of advocating for full independence since it was unknown if the King would regain his power from Napoleon.

Once Chile gained independence, many political groupings emerged. They were based on various popular leaders during that time, instead of common political ideas. Two very strong political groupings were the Pipolos (liberals) and the Pelucónes (conservatives). Two minor parties, the O’Higginists and the Tobacconists, were often on the Pelucónes&#x27; side. After Diego Portales Palazuelos became the architect of the New Institution and the Constitution of 1833, the Pelucónes prevailed for thirty years (1831–1861).

From 1831 to 1861, the prevailing political system was one in which the President co-opted a successor. This system greatly influenced the idea that power should be transferred between members of the ruling political faction. It was only the &quot;Question of the Sacristan&quot; (1856), which divided The Pelucónes, allowed for the rise of the Liberals to power in 1861.

=== Dominance of the traditional parties (1860–1920) ===
The formal emergence of political parties in Chilean institutions occurred around the 1850s. Chileans began to challenge the President as the leading role in national political life through the National Congress. In 1891, the disagreement was resolved after a Civil War, in favor of a parliamentary system.

Around that time, the rise of the middle class would eventually lead to the creation of the Radical Party. Their campaign started in the 1850s, as a group defending the interests of the silver mine owners, but it would gradually shift its focus to the employees of the growing state bureaucracy. Soon afterwards, from the same branch of radicalism, the Democratic Party appeared. It was a community that was born closer to the working class segment of society, but that over time would join the game of alliances within the rest of the party system.

After the Chilean Civil War of 1891, the political system began to embody elements of a parliamentary system. Hence, the political coalitions became very strong. Although around twenty distinct political parties and movements existed, Chilean politics was structured around two large groups: the Liberal Alliance (of Liberal and Progressive tendency) and the Coalition (Conservative, Catholics). At the same time, political parties, formerly tools of the upper-class, expanded to include the thriving middle and working classes too.

=== Expansion of political parties (1920–1973) ===
With the rise of immigration from Europe, workers with anarchist and socialist ideas came to Chile. Additionally, in the mid-19 century, the union movement began in the nitrate fields of the north of Chile through a surge of the joint labor unions. It is from these processes that in 1912, the Workers&#x27; Socialist Party was founded in Iquique by the typographer Luis Emilio Recabarren and 30 union workers and employees. The Workers&#x27; Socialist Party is defined as the political party of the Chilean working class. In 1922, the party joined the Third Communist International. Since that date, the party has been known as the Communist Party of Chile.

In the period between 1920 and 1938 (between the start of the first presidential term of Arturo Alessandri Palma and the end of his second term) a series of political incidents led to the loss of the importance of traditional nineteenth-century parties, but for the benefit of the &quot;party masses&quot;.

The splendor of this new type of political party would come with the three presidential terms of the Radical Party between 1938 and 1952. At that time, the Radical Party (the faction of the middle class, par excellence), transformed into a large body of positions and political favors, which in the long run would lead to its discredit. Its place as an intermediate political group—between the right and the left—would be taken by the Christian Democratic Party. The Christian Democratic Party is the successor of the National Falange, which in turn had split from the declining Conservative Party after the victory of Eduardo Frei Montalva (1964–1970). Regarding political parties, their main characteristic between 1938 and 1973 was their structuring into the classic &quot;three-thirds&quot; system (right, center, and left).

With Salvador Allende, the Popular Unity came to power as a vast political coalition composed of elements from the center and the left. However, the Military Coup of 1973 signified not only the disappearance of the Popular Unity, but the breakdown of the party system and its end during most of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Only in the last year of the military dictatorship was the Organic Constitutional Law of Political Parties enacted, which regulated their formation and function.

=== Proscription of parties and reorganization (1973–1990) ===
Between 1973 and 1987, Chilean political parties were prohibited. On October 8, 1973, the members of the Popular Unity were banned and three days later, the rest of the political parties and movements were declared adjourned, and definitively dissolved on March 12, 1977.

On October 1, 1996, the Organic Constitutional Law was published in the Legal Gazette, which re-established the system of electoral registrations and created the Electoral Service of Chile (Servel) as a replacement for the former Directorate of the Electoral Registry. On March 23, 1987, the Organic Constitutional Law of Political Parties was published—which established its objectives, requirements for legalization and the internal organization between others—with which the groups began procedures for their legal recognition.

The National Party was the first political organization to be legally recognized by the Servel on December 23, 1987, inscribed officially in the registry on January 4, 1988. In the following months—before the Plebiscite of October 5, 1988—the National Advance, Humanist, National Renewal, Radical Democracy, Socialist, Christian Democratic (CDP), Party for Democracy, Party of the South, Radical and Green parties were legalized.

=== Return to democracy (1990–2022) ===
With the restoration of Democracy in 1990, the prominent political coalition was the Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia (&quot;Coalition of Parties for Democracy)&quot;, a center-left group initially founded by 17 parties, of which the most important, which remained in the coalition throughout the years, were: The Christian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, the Party for Democracy and the Radical Party. The &quot;Concertación&quot; governed Chile throughout the presidencies of Patricio Aylwin (1990–1994), Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle (1994–2000), Ricardo Lagos (2000–2006) and Michelle Bachelet (2006–2010). The opponent of the ruling coalition, was the Alianza (&quot;Alliance&quot;). The Alliance was a group of center-right parties, formed by the main parties that supported the &quot;YES&quot; option in the 1988 plebiscite. Extra-parliamentarily, there was the leftist coalition Juntos Podemos Más (Together we can do more), formed by the Communist Party, Humanist Party, PC-AP and others left-wing movements, this coalition did not achieve great electoral results due to the binomial system, which favoured the Concertacion and the alliance.

The &quot;Alliance&quot; came to power when Sebastián Piñera (2010–2014) assumed office. In 2013, after electoral losses, the &quot;Concertación&quot;, with the intention of renewing its image, decided to make an agreement with the Communist Party, the Citizen Left, and the MAS Region, creating the New Majority. This coalition won comfortable victories in the 2013 elections and achieved re-election of Michelle Bachelet between 2014 and 2018. In turn, the parties that made up the Alliance, regrouped in 2015 in a new coalition denominated Chile Vamos (&quot;Let&#x27;s go Chile&quot;).

In 2016, the number of political parties in Chile doubled, increasing from 14 to 32. It came as a precursor to the municipal elections of the year and the Parliamentary Elections of 2017, given that they will be the first to be held under the new proportional electoral system, the replacement for the binomial system. The binomial system favoured the existence of two blocks to the detriment of isolated parties and independent candidates. In that election, the Frente Amplio (&quot;Broad Front&quot;) appeared, a coalition that brought together left-wing sectors, which surprisingly won the election of 20 deputies. In the presidential election, Sebastián Piñera was able to return to the government and establish Chile Vamos (&quot;Let&#x27;s go Chile&quot;) as an official coalition between 2018 and 2022.

=== Constitutional Convention and reorganization of coalitions (2022–present) ===
After the social outburst of 2019, a plebiscite was held that defined the drafting of a new constitution through a Constitutional Convention. The members of that body were elected in May 2021, in a process that benefited independents over political party militants. The most successful group of independents was The List of the People.

From that election, the coalition Apruebo Dignidad (&quot;I Approve Dignity&quot;) emerged, which gathered the coalitions Frente Amplio (&quot;Broad Front&quot;) and Chile Digno (&quot;Worthy Chile&quot;). This group supported the presidential candidacy of Gabriel Boric, who after winning in the ballot decided to summon the Socialist, For Democracy, Radical and Liberal parties to the government, which were grouped in a coalition called Democratic Socialism. This implied the definitive break of the former Concertación/New Majority with the Christian Democratic Party, which was not invited to the new administration.

From the right-wing emerged the Republican Party, which in the parliamentary elections achieved the election of 14 deputies and one senator, facing the traditional center-right grouped in Chile Vamos, which from 2022 went to the opposition after the end of Piñera&#x27;s government. Other blocks also emerged in those elections, such as the conservative liberal Partido de la gente (&quot;Party of the people&quot;).

<doc id="409113" wikidata="Q268057" url="?curid=409113" title="Cosmopolitan (cocktail)">
<text>A cosmopolitan, or, informally, a cosmo, is a cocktail made with vodka, Cointreau, cranberry juice, and freshly squeezed or sweetened lime juice.

The cosmopolitan is a member of the Gimlet family of cocktails. Though often presented far differently, the cosmopolitan also bears a likeness in composition to the kamikaze shooter. 

==Preparation and serving==
The International Bartenders Association recipe is based on citron vodka, lemon-flavored vodka. The use of citrus-flavored vodka as the basis for this cocktail appears to have been widely popularized in the mid-1990s by cocktail expert Dale DeGroff and is used in the IBA-approved recipe. Many bartenders, however, continue to use a standard unflavored vodka — this alternative would undoubtedly be historically consistent with any of the supposed predecessors of this drink that were popular in Ohio, Provincetown, or Minneapolis during the 1970s, or in San Francisco during the 1980s. A lemon twist is sometimes used to garnish.

The cosmopolitan is usually served in a large cocktail glass, also called a &quot;martini glass&quot;. For this reason, the drink is sometimes mistakenly categorized as a type of martini.

==Origins and mixology==
The origin of the cosmopolitan is disputed, with some histories tracing it from the gay community in 1970s Provincetown, moving west to Cleveland and Minneapolis, and landing in San Francisco. From there, it moved back east, with the contemporary recipe being mixed in 1989 in New York City. Another claim to the cosmo&#x27;s origin is South Beach, Florida, in the mid-1980s.

=== Various creation claims ===
==== The 1930s ====
While the cocktail is widely perceived to be a more modern creation, there is a recipe for a &quot;Cosmopolitan Daisy&quot; which appears in &quot;Pioneers of Mixing at Elite Bars 1903–1933&quot;, published in 1934:

Made with ingredients that would have been readily available during the period, this identically named cocktail aims for the same effect. If this drink is, in fact, the source of the modern cosmopolitan, then it would be an adaptation of a Daisy rather than a Kamikaze.

==== 1970s: Provincetown ====
One version of the creation of this popular drink credits the accomplishment to the gay community in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

==== 1970s: John Caine ==== 
John Caine is the owner of several popular bars in San Francisco and a cosmopolitan expert. He partially credits the upsurge in cocktails during the 1970s to the Cosmo being served at fern bars. Caine is credited with bringing the Cosmo west from Cleveland.

==== 1975: Neal Murray ==== 
Bartender Neal Murray says he created the cosmopolitan in 1975 at the Cork &amp; Cleaver steak house in Minneapolis. According to Murray, he added a splash of cranberry juice to a Kamikaze and the first taster declared, &quot;How cosmopolitan.&quot; 

Murray&#x27;s Cosmopolitan used 1.5 oz Gordon&#x27;s Gin, .75 oz Rose&#x27;s Lime, .75 oz Leroux triple sec, and .5 oz cranberry juice.

==== 1985: Cheryl Cook ==== 
There are several other claims made as to the origin of the cosmopolitan. Cocktail historian Gary Regan credits bartender Cheryl Cook of the Strand Restaurant in South Beach, Florida, with the original creation. In a letter to Regan, Cook related the story of how she created the drink in 1985 or 1986:

Cook&#x27;s original recipes called for &quot;Absolut Citron, a splash of Triple sec, a drop of Rose&#x27;s lime and just enough cranberry to make it oh so pretty in pink.&quot; Although Absolut Citron was not introduced anywhere officially until 1988, it was test-marketed in Miami.

==== 1987: Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Mitten ====
Cheryl Charming&#x27;s The Cocktail Companion credits a bartender named Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Mitten with bringing the drink to New York City from San Francisco in October 1987.

==== 1989: Toby Cecchini &amp; Melissa Huffsmith-Roth ==== 
Notable bartender Gaz Regan says that the internationally recognized version of the cocktail was created by Toby Cecchini &amp; Melissa Huffsmith-Roth in 1989 at The Odeon, a restaurant in Manhattan, based on a poorly described version of Cheryl Cook&#x27;s creation. Cecchini and Huffsmith-Roth&#x27;s Cosmopolitan includes 2 oz Absolut Citron vodka, 1 oz Cointreau, 1 oz lime juice, and .5 oz cranberry juice. Other sources give Cecchini sole credit for the contemporary drink&#x27;s invention.

==== 1993: New York City ==== 
According to Sally Ann Berk and Bob Sennett, the Cosmopolitan appears in literature as early as 1993 and derives from New York City.

==Popularity==
The cosmopolitan gained popularity in the 1990s thanks in part to Madonna. Dale DeGroff explains that after the singer was spotted drinking one in 1996, overnight he received calls across the globe, &quot;as far away as Germany and Australia&quot; for the recipe. 

It was later frequently mentioned on the television program &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, in which Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s character, Carrie Bradshaw, commonly ordered the drink when out with her girlfriends. The trend was spoofed in the 2008 film adaptation when Miranda Hobbes asks Carrie why she ceased drinking them, to which Carrie replies, &quot;Because everyone else started.&quot;

==Variations==
* One variation calls for stirring in a mixing glass, instead of shaking.
* An alternative ingredient in substitution for Cointreau is a variation of the French Martini.
* The &quot;Real Housewives of New Jersey&quot; star Kathy Wakile created a Red Velvet Cosmo, based on one of her favorite desserts, red velvet cake.
* For a virgin cosmopolitan, replace the vodka and triple sec with orange juice and pink lemonade.
* For a &quot;constipolitan,&quot; use prune juice in place of cranberry juice.
* A CosNOpolitan, from Kimbal Musk&#x27;s The Kitchen, has cranberry juice, lime, orange bitters, and soda.

<doc id="409114" wikidata="Q5116889" url="?curid=409114" title="Church of God by Faith">
<text>The Church of God by Faith is a Methodist denomination aligned with the holiness movement. It is based in the United States. The Church of God by Faith was organized by the Methodist minister John Bright in 1919.

==History==
The &quot;Church of God By Faith, Inc.&quot; is a religious institution founded in 1914 in Jacksonville, Florida, United States, by John Bright, Aaron Matthews, Sr., Nathaniel Scippio and Hubert Steadman. In 1922 an assembly was held in Alachua, Florida, US, a charter was drafted, and the name &quot;Church of God By Faith, Inc.&quot; officially adopted. Since 1987 the annual meetings of the church have been held in Atlanta, Georgia. Hubert Steadman became the first Executive Secretary and Editor for the Sunday School literature and other publications.

The first assembly meeting of the church was held in 1917 at White Springs, Florida; after which, missions were set up in various places. Palatka, Florida, was the &quot;headquarters&quot; of the group in 1919. A General Assembly was held in Alachua, Florida, in 1922 where the leading elders drafted a charter, now known as the &quot;Church of God By Faith, Inc.&quot; The General Assembly was moved from Alachua to Ocala, Florida, in December 1941. In 1987, the church went annually to Atlanta, Georgia, where meetings are still held.

The Church of God by Faith, Inc. has had four bishops:
#Aaron Matthews, Sr.: 1915–1959;
#Willie W. Matthews: 1959–1984;
#James E. McKnight, Sr: 1984–2014;
#James E. McKnight, Jr.: Presiding

==Beliefs==
The church stands in the Wesleyan-holiness tradition of Methodism, teaching that entire sanctification is an instantaneous work obtained by faith, but must be preceded through the consecration of the individual. It believes in divine healing, but does not reject the use of medicine and doctors.

Articles of Faith

God is first in the Godhead - the church believes in one eternally existent, infinite God, sovereign of the universe. He only is God, creative and administrative, holy in nature attributes and purpose. He as God, is first in the Godhead, an essential being, revealed as Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.

Jesus Christ- the church believes in Jesus Christ, the second person of the Godhead. Christ was eternally one with the Father. He became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and was born of the Virgin Mary so that two whole and perfect natures, (the Godhead and manhood) are thus united in one person, very God and very man, the God-man. The church believes that Jesus Christ died for its member&#x27;s sins and that He rose from the dead and took again His body, together with all things appertaining to the perfection of man&#x27;s nature, wherewith He ascended into Heaven and is there engaged in intercession for members.

The Holy Spirit- the church believes in the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Godhead. The Holy Spirit is ever present and efficiently active in and with the church of Christ, convincing the world of sin, regenerating those who repent and believe, sanctifying believers and guiding them into all truth as it is in Jesus.

Holy Scriptures- the church believes in the plenary inspiration of the Holy Scriptures. The sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments are given by divine inspiration, revealing the will of God concerning members in all things necessary to their salvation, so that whatever is not contained therein is not to be enjoined as an article of faith.

Original Sin of Depravity- the church believes that original sin or depravity is that corruption of the nature of all the offspring of Adam by reason of which everyone is very far gone from original righteousness or the pure state of our first parents at the time of their creation, is averse to God, is without spiritual life and inclined to evil, and that it continues to exist with the new life of the regenerate until eradicated by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Atonement - the church believes that Jesus Christ, by His suffering, the shedding of His blood, and His meritorious death on the cross, made a full atonement for all human sin. This atonement is the only grounds for salvation and that it is sufficient for every individual of Adam&#x27;s race.

Free Agency - the church believes that man&#x27;s creation in God&#x27;s likeness included the ability to choose between right and wrong. Thus, man was made morally responsible and through the fall of Adam he became depraved. So, he can not now turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength and works of faith and calling upon God. But only by the grace of God, through Jesus Christ that is freely bestowed upon all men, enabling all who will to turn from sin to righteousness. Members believe in Jesus Christ for pardon and the cleansing from sin, and believe that man, though in possession of the experience of regeneration and entire sanctification, may fall from grace and apostatize, and unless he repents of his sin, will be hopelessly and eternally lost.

Repentance - the church believes that repentance, which is a sincere and thorough change of mind in regard to sin, involving a sense of personal guilt and voluntary turning away from sin is demanded of all who have by act or purpose become sinners against God. The Spirit of God gives to all that will repent the gracious help of penitence of heart and hope of mercy, that they may believe unto pardon and spiritual life.

Justification and Adoption - the church believes that justification is that gracious and judicial act of God by which He grants full pardon of all guilt and complete release from the penalty of sins committed and acceptance as righteous to all who believe and receive Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
Members are expected to believe that regeneration or the new birth is that gracious work of God whereby the moral nature of the repentant believer is spiritually quickened and given a distinctively spiritual life, capable of faith, love and obedience.
Members are expected to believe that adoption is that gracious act of God by which the justified and regenerated believer is constituted a &quot;Son of God&quot;. Justification, regeneration and adoption are simultaneous in the experience of seekers after God and are obtained upon the condition of faith, preceded by repentance.

Entire Sanctification - the church believes that entire sanctification is the act of God, subsequent to regeneration, by which believers are made free from original sin or depravity, and brought into a state of entire devotion to God and the Holy obedience of love is made perfect. It is wrought by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and comprehends in one experience the cleansing of the heart from sin and the abiding indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, empowering the believer for life and service. Entire sanctification is provided by the blood of Jesus, is wrought instantaneously by faith, preceded by entire consecration. This experience is also known as &quot;Christian Perfection&quot;, &quot;Heart Purity&quot;, and &quot;The Baptism of the Holy Ghost&quot; and&quot;Christian Holiness.&quot;

Second Coming of Christ - the church believes that Jesus Christ will come again. It believes that members who are alive at his coming will not precede those who are dead, but that they will be caught up with the risen saints to meet the Lord in the air.

Resurrection, Judgement and Destiny - the church believes in the resurrection of the dead. That the bodies of both the just and the unjust will be resurrected and united with their spirit. Members are expected to believe in future judgment in which every man shall appear before God to be judged according to his deeds in this life.

Divine Healing - the church believes in the Bible doctrine of divine healing and urges its congregates to seek the prayer of faith for the healing of the sick. Medical consultants and agencies when deemed necessary are not condemned.

==Organization==
National headquarters are located in Jacksonville, Florida. Churches are up and down the eastern seaboard of the United States from New York to Florida – with a few churches in Texas, the Midwest and in the state of Washington. There are also dozens of international affiliated ministries.

==Membership==
 the Church of God by Faith, Inc. had over 189 churches and dozens of international affiliates.

<text>This article lists [[political party|political parties]] in [[Colombia]].

Colombia had historically maintained a two-party system, which means that there were two dominant political parties, resulting in considerable difficulty for anybody to achieve major electoral success under the banner of any other party. Dissidents from the two main parties also had chances to win elections. Nowadays it is a multi-party system, with every party that gets more than 3% of the valid votes for each of the two chambers in the congress (as well as some special cases like parties of minority groups) getting legal recognition.

== Parties with legal recognition ==
In the Parliamentary election of 2022, the following parties got the minimum required number of votes for legal recognition (3% of valid votes).


=== Parties of ethnic minorities ===
The following parties obtained representation in the congress despite not surpassing the required percentage, thanks to being in representation of ethnic minorities.

==Defunct parties==
* Christian National Party (2002)
* Christians for Community (2002)
* Alternative Way (2002)
* Alternative for Social Advance (2002)

<doc id="409117" wikidata="Q1277427" url="?curid=409117" title="List of political parties in Yemen">
<text>Before the Yemeni Revolution in 2011 and the following civil war, Yemen was a one party dominant state in which the General People&#x27;s Congress (GPC) held power.

==Legal status==
Yemen&#x27;s Political Parties Law mandates that political parties be viable national organizations comprising at least 75 founders and 2,500 members and not restrict membership to a particular region. The government provides financial support to political parties, including a stipend for newspaper publication.

==Elections 2003–2006==
The GPC captured 238 of 301 seats in parliament in the 2003 elections. In the September 2006 elections for local and governorate councils, the GPC garnered 315 seats in the governorates (74 percent of the popular vote) and 5,078 local council seats (74 percent of the popular vote). In the September 2006 presidential election, the Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) backed opposition candidate Faisal bin Shamlan, whose success in garnering 22 percent of the popular vote was viewed at the time as a first step in challenging the political stronghold of President Saleh and the GPC. However, disputes between the GPC and the JMP in 2007 over election law amendments, coupled with the JMP’s opposition to President Saleh’s proposed democratic reform measures, have halted initial attempts to forge a dialogue between the two parties.

==List of parties==
For the sake of clarity, this section is divided into three lists. These are major parties, minor parties and defunct parties. Major parties are defined as parties which gained a seat in the last elections in 2003. Since there has been a long time without elections with a lot of political shift in between, parties that either control territory with their armed wing (such as Ansar Allah) or have over 10.000 likes on facebook are also taken into this category. All other operating parties are listed under minor parties. Parties that are long inactive are listed as defunct, although some might be revived at some point.
===Major parties===

===Minor parties===
===Defunct parties===

==List of coalitions==
*The National Council for the Forces of the Peaceful Revolution was declared on 17 August 2011, amidst the Yemeni Revolution, to unite the opposition groups, parties, coalitions, and youth protesters. Among the 143 representatives elected to sit on it are leaders from Al-Islah, the South Yemen Movement, the Alliance of Yemeni Tribes, and the defected First Armoured Division.
**The Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) was formed in 2005 by five opposition parties to effect political and economic reform. It includes the northern-based, tribal, and Islamist-oriented Yemeni Congregation for Reform (Islah) and the secular Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), which represents the remnants of the former South Yemeni leadership. According to &quot;Al Jazeera English&quot;, it was formed in 2002 and includes Islah, Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), Hizb Al-Haq (a semi-religious party), the Unionist party, and the Popular Forces Union party. The spokesperson as of 23 March 2011 is Muhammad Qahtan, who replaced Mohammed Al-Sabri.
**The Common Forum includes the five biggest opposition groups in Yemen, including Reform, Socialist, Nasserist, Popular Force and al-Haq. (Likely just another name for the JMP.)

<doc id="409120" wikidata="Q7631960" url="?curid=409120" title="Subscriber trunk dialling">
<text>Subscriber trunk dialling (STD), also known as subscriber toll dialing, is a telephone numbering plan feature and telecommunications technology in the United Kingdom and various Commonwealth countries for the dialling of trunk calls by telephone subscribers without the assistance of switchboard operators.

Switching systems to enable automatic dialling of long distance calls by subscribers were introduced in the United Kingdom on 5 December 1958. The system used area codes that were based on the letters in a town&#x27;s name. A ceremonial first call was made by Queen Elizabeth II from Bristol to Edinburgh.

A similar service, built on crossbar equipment, using regionally structured numbering, rather than alphanumeric codes, was experimentally introduced by P&amp;T in Ireland in 1957, with the first services being in Athlone. A full service was rolled out in 1958, initially to exchanges in Cork and then Dublin and its hinterland, and gradually to all areas with automatic exchanges.

The term &#x27;STD call&#x27; was once commonly used in the UK, Ireland, Australia, India, and parts of Southeast Asia, but it may be considered archaic today, or possibly even no longer be understood. Other less technical terms like &#x27;national calling,&#x27; &#x27;long distance calling&#x27; and so on are now more commonly used. The distinction between local and long distance / STD calls is also no longer relevant to many users, as calls are charged at flat or bundled rates. It is also necessary to dial area codes on some calls, especially from mobile phones, so they are considered part of the number.

Terms such as &#x27;area code&#x27;, &#x27;prefix&#x27; or &#x27;national dialling code&#x27; tend to be used in place of &#x27;STD code&#x27; in the UK and in Ireland.

==History==

In the first half of the 20th century, telecommunication services developed progressively from completely manual setup of calls by operators called by subscribers, to automatic systems that could connect subscribers of the same local exchange through the use of telephone dials installed in each telephone.

In the 1940s, the Bell System in the United States and Canada developed methods and technologies, called direct distance dialing and first implemented in 1951, that enabled telephone subscriber to dial long-distance telephone calls themselves without calling an operator. In the United Kingdom, a similar technology called &quot;subscriber trunk dialling&quot; (STD) was ready by 1958, when Queen Elizabeth II, who was in Bristol, publicised STD by dialling Edinburgh, the farthest distance a call could be directly dialled in the UK, on 5 December 1958. The STD system was completed in 1979.

The technology was extended when, from 8 March 1963, subscribers in London were able to directly dial Paris using international direct dialling.

The term &quot;subscriber trunk dialling&quot; is used in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, India and South East Asia. In the UK, the term is obsolescent, better known as the UK area codes.

The introduction in the UK of subscriber dialling of long-distance calls removed the distinction that had existed between trunk and toll calls. This term however, is still widely prevalent in India to describe any national call made outside one&#x27;s local unit. A &quot;subscriber&quot; is someone who subscribes to, i.e. rents, a telephone line, and a &quot;trunk call&quot; is one made over a trunk line, i.e. a telephone line connecting two exchanges a long distance apart. Since all calls may be dialled direct today, the term has fallen into disuse.

===Numbering plan===
In subscriber trunk dialing, each designated region of a country is identified by a unique numerical code (the STD code) that must be dialed as a prefix to each telephone number when placing calls.

Each city with a director system was assigned a three-digit code, in which the second digit corresponded to the first letter of the city name on the telephone dial, except London which had the two-digit code 01. Codes were later changed (e.g., London became 020, and Manchester 0161).
*01 London
*021 Birmingham
*031 Edinburgh
*041 Glasgow
*051 Liverpool
*061 Manchester

===Calls between the UK and Ireland===
Because of the high volume of calls between the Republic of Ireland and the UK, international direct dialling was implemented before the formal introduction of International Subscriber Dialling. Calls were processed through the domestic STD networks and passed between the two networks as trunk traffic, without the need for international gateway exchanges.

====From the Republic of Ireland====
Calls to Northern Ireland were made by dialling 08 and the Northern Irish STD code, for example Belfast was reached by dialling 08 0232.

Calls to Britain were made by dialling 03 and the British STD code, e.g. 03 0222 XXX XXX or 03 061 XXX YYYY.

Calls to cities with director area codes could also still be made with the following codes; this was an older arrangement but the numbering remained in service until the 03 code was closed:

*031 London
*032 Birmingham
*033 Edinburgh
*034 Glasgow
*035 Liverpool
*036 Manchester
*Calls to Belfast could also be dialled with 084 and the local six-digit number. Belfast was not a director area.

In 1992, Ireland adopted the harmonised European international access code 00, replacing the 16 prefix for international calls and the legacy arrangements for calling Britain. From that year, calls were made in the standard international format, i.e. , and the 03 range was withdrawn from use.

Calls to Northern Ireland are now made by dialling 048 and the eight-digit local number, omitting the 028 STD code. This ensures calls are charged at lower rates. Alternatively, the full international code +44 28 can be used.

==== Calls to Ireland from the UK ====
These were dialled using the full international code 010 353, or using legacy short codes. Examples were:

*Dublin 0001
*Cork 0002
*Limerick 0006
*Galway 0009

These legacy codes dialled directly into Irish cities that had crossbar switching in the 1950s and 1960s, and predated the introduction of ISD in the UK. The Irish STD system evolved around the introduction of LM Ericsson ARM and ITT Pentaconta crossbar trunk/tandem switches, and did not use the UK&#x27;s director approach. While these calls were international, they were processed within the UK STD infrastructure, without passing through an international gateway exchange.

Calls to Ireland are now made in the standard international format +353 (or 00 353) and special codes are no longer used.

<text>This article lists political parties in Venezuela.
Historically, Venezuela has had two major parties, along with numerous other minor parties. That system imploded at the 1998 elections into a multi-party system. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Fifth Republic Movement emerged as a dominant party. Its position was continued by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (into which it merged on 20 October 2007), although it is not certain at all if this party system is going to remain stable through the following elections.

<doc id="409122" wikidata="Q1158897" url="?curid=409122" title="Dampier, Western Australia">
<text>Dampier is a major industrial port in the Pilbara region in the northwest of Western Australia. It is located near the city of Karratha and Port Walcott.

Dampier Port is part of the Dampier Archipelago and is primarily a port for the export of iron ore from Rio Tinto mines, LNG and salt. The port services petrochemical, salt, iron ore and natural gas export industries. Rio Tinto exports large volumes of iron ore, especially Pilbara blend through the port, and in September 2010 announced plans to expand capacity. At the 2011 census, Dampier had a population of 1,341.

==History==

The Yaburrara Aboriginal tribe lived in the area for many thousands of years.

The town derives its name from its location on Dampier Island 3 km off the Pilbara Coast and part of the Dampier Archipelago, both named after the English navigator William Dampier. In 1963, the island became an artificial peninsula when it was connected to the mainland by a causeway for a road and railway. In 1979, Dampier Peninsular was renamed after Mt Burrup, the highest peak on the island, which had been named after Henry Burrup, a Union Bank clerk murdered in 1885 at Roebourne.

In 1699, Dampier, in command of the 26-gun warship HMS &quot;Roebuck&quot; on a mission to explore the coast of New Holland, following the Dutch route to the Indies, passed between Dirk Hartog Island and the Western Australian mainland into what he called Shark Bay. He then followed the coast northeast, on 21 August 1699, reaching the Dampier Archipelago, which he explored, naming Rosemary Island. He continued to Lagrange Bay, just south of what is now Roebuck Bay, before sailing for Timor.

The town was built from 1965 onwards, to serve the railway transporting iron ore from Tom Price and Paraburdoo. By 1968, the further expansion of Dampier had been constrained by geographical factors, and a new town of Karratha was established on the mainland as a result.

==Environment==
The Burrup Peninsula, or Murujuga, which means &quot;Hip Bone Sticking Out&quot; in the Yaburrara language, is home to what is believed to be the largest collection of petroglyphs (ancient rock art) in the world.

There are 42 other islands in the Dampier Archipelago. There is a hugely diverse marine ecosystem around the islands, including whales, dugongs, turtles, coral, and sponges. Green turtles, (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) are known to nest in the Dampier Archipelago.

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification, Dampier has a desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;). The annual average rainfall is , which would make it a semi-arid climate, except, like Alice Springs, its high evapotranspiration (or its aridity) makes it a desert climate. Dampier has extremely hot and humid summers with dewpoints exceeding . Having over 3,700 hours of annual sunshine, it is one of the sunniest places in Australia and the world; its sunshine hours approach those of Aswan in Egypt.

==Attractions==
At the entrance to the town is a statue of &quot;Red Dog&quot;, a red kelpie/cattledog well known for roaming the area in the 1970s and hitching rides to nearby towns. The statue reads &quot;Erected by the many friends made during his travels&quot;. Other attractions include the fishing not far off the coast, the most commonly targeted species being barramundi (&quot;Lates calcarifer&quot;).

==Port==

The port of Dampier was opened in 1966, when the first iron ore from the Mount Tom Price mine was transported via the Hamersley &amp; Robe River railway to Parker Point and loaded on ships. The port at East Intercourse Island opened in 1972.

The port has an annual loading capacity of 140 million tonnes of iron ore. Rio Tinto&#x27;s other iron ore port, Cape Lambert, can handle 80 million tonnes per year. It takes from 24 to 36 hours to load a ship at port. With the neighbouring ports of Port Hedland and Port Walcott, Dampier is one of three major iron ore exporting ports in the Pilbara region The closest airport to the port is Karratha, located less than 20 kilometres away.

<text>This article lists political parties in Vanuatu.
Vanuatu has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. Not all parties have a consistent ideology, and of those that do not, most members tend to support the political positions/attitudes of the party leader. Prior to 2024, politicians switching parties several times over the span of a few years was not uncommon. Governments typically comprise coalitions of numerous small parties which change regularly, with parties and MPs &quot;crossing the floor&quot; (although the latter of which was prohibited in 2024), and Prime Ministers being ousted in motions of no confidence has previously occurred several times in one legislative term.

<text>Köpenick () is a historic town and locality (&quot;Ortsteil&quot;) in Berlin, situated at the confluence of the rivers Dahme and Spree in the south-east of the German capital. It was formerly known as Copanic and then Cöpenick, only officially adopting the current spelling in 1931. It is also known for the famous imposter &quot;Hauptmann von Köpenick&quot;.

Prior to its incorporation into Berlin in 1920, Köpenick had been an independent town. It then became a borough of Berlin, and with an area of , Berlin&#x27;s largest. As a result of Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform, the borough of Köpenick was merged with that of Treptow to create the current borough of Treptow-Köpenick.

Köpenick is home to the Bundesliga football club 1. FC Union Berlin, who play at the Stadion An der Alten Försterei. Mellowpark, the largest outdoor skatepark in Europe, is located in the town.

==Geography==
===Overview===
A large percentage of Köpenick&#x27;s surface area is made up of pine forests and expanses of water like lake Müggelsee, which is why it is often referred to as the &quot;green lungs&quot; of Berlin (&quot;Grüne Lunge Berlins&quot;). The Müggelberge hills in the south-east of Köpenick reach , making them the highest natural point of Berlin.

The historic town lies in the center of the Berlin &quot;Urstromtal&quot; meltwater valley, on an island at the confluence of the Dahme and Spree rivers. The original island had been separated by two channelisation ditches, the &quot;Katzengraben&quot; and the &quot;Schlossgraben&quot;, into what are now the three islands &quot;Baumgarteninsel&quot; (&quot;plantation island&quot;), &quot;Old Town&quot; and &quot;Schlossinsel&quot; (&quot;palace island&quot;), on which the eponymous Köpenick Palace is located. The &quot;Katzengraben&quot; is now the main navigable branch of the Spree, transecting the old river bend north of the Old Town.

The Spree links Köpenick with lake Müggelsee and inner Berlin, and further via the Havel and Elbe rivers with the North Sea. The Oder–Spree Canal links the Dahme, at nearby Schmöckwitz, with the Oder river, at Eisenhüttenstadt, thus providing a navigable connection between Köpenick, the Oder and thus the Baltic Sea.

===Neighborhoods===
Köpenick comprises nine neighborhoods:
* The old town (Altstadt)
* Kietzer Vorstadt
* Dammvorstadt
* The North (Köpenick-Nord) with:
** Siedlung Dammfeld
** Elsengrund
** Uhlenhorst
** Wolfsgarten
* Amtsfeld and Kämmereiheide with:
** Salvador-Allende-Viertel
* Köllnische Vorstadt
* Spindlersfeld
* Wendenschloß
* Kietzer Feld

===Panorama===
==History==
While its origins are shrouded in mystery, Köpenick has had a long history as an independent town. In the 12th century, it was the residence of a Slavic prince, Jaxa of Köpenick. By this time, it had probably been settled by Lechitic tribes for about 400 years. After Jaxa&#x27;s death, the principality was reigned by the dukes of Pomerania. While Albert the Bear had taken the Slavic city of Brenna in 1157, which was renamed Brandenburg, and thus formed the nucleus of what would eventually become the synonymous margraviate, the area around Köpenick was conquered from the south and thus initially became part of the March of Lusatia.

While Jaxa&#x27;s bracteates or &quot;hollow pennies&quot; are coined with the impression &quot;Iaczo de Copnic&quot;, in written history, Köpenick first appeared in a deed dated 12 Feb 1210 and issued under the seal of Margrave Conrad II of Lusatia, which contains the reference &quot;Acta sunt hec ad Copnic&quot;. 1210 is also the year when on Conrad&#x27;s death power in the principality transited to the Margraviate of Meißen and the House of Wettin. Köpenick was afforded town privileges by 1232, and German colonization commenced.

Köpenick may therefore be considered one of the oldest settlements in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, predating Spandau, Berlin and Cölln, which was first mentioned in a 1237 deed. For the most part of its history, the town was known as &quot;Cöp(e)nick&quot;.

The old Cöpenick consisted of three distinct parts that co-existed for centuries on the three banks of the &quot;Frauentog&quot;, a bight in the river Dahme: the castle with its garrison, the German-settled town of artisans, peasants and merchants, and the for still some time Sorbic-speaking Kietz, a hamlet containing the fishermen.

The castle was conquered by the Ascanian margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg in 1245, defeating their rivals Margrave Henry III of Meissen and the Archbishop of Magdeburg.

In 1631, the emissaries of George William, Elector of Brandenburg met at Cöpenick the approaching army of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, in a vain effort to stop the ongoing devastation of the margraviate during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

In 1906, Wilhelm Voigt, a shoemaker and drifter, masqueraded as a Prussian officer and commandeered a squad of soldiers to follow him to Cöpenick to take control of the town hall. Carl Zuckmayer perpetuated the incident in his play &quot;The Captain of Cöpenick&quot;, on which several film and television adaptations have been based.

By 1907, Cöpenick was the largest town in the county of Teltow. Under the terms of the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, Cöpenick was incorporated as the 16th, and with an area of the largest, borough of Berlin. Apart from the former town of Cöpenick proper, the borough included the parishes of Oberschöneweide, Grünau, Schmöckwitz, Müggelheim, Rahnsdorf and Friedrichshagen. In 1931, the borough&#x27;s spelling was officially amended from &quot;Cöpenick&quot; to nowadays&#x27; &quot;Köpenick&quot;.

In the months that followed the Nazi&#x27;s rise to power, SA storm troops abducted and brutally tortured residents they considered political adversaries. In June 1933 the terror culminated in the Week of Blood, that left at least 24 Nazi opponents across the political spectrum dead and many more maimed. One of the sites at which the atrocities took place, the prison annex to the district court at Mandrellaplatz, has been turned into a museum. During World War II, Köpenick was the location of a subcamp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, mostly for Polish women, but also Czechoslovak, French, Greek, Belgian and Soviet, including of Romani descent.

During the Cold War, Köpenick was part of the Soviet sector and thus East Berlin.

As a result of the 2001 administrative reform, the Berlin borough of Köpenick was merged with that of Treptow to create the current borough of Treptow-Köpenick.

Until it was decommissioned in 2002, a large radio facility for MW and FM was located near the &quot;Uhlenhorst&quot; neighbourhood, including a self-radiating radio mast, which was insulated against earth. Following decommissioning, the FM services of this facility were moved to the Fernsehturm at Alexanderplatz and the AM transmitters were moved to a new aerial mast at Zehlendorf bei Oranienburg.

==Köpenick Palace==
The palace &quot;(Schloss Köpenick)&quot; was originally built in 1558 as a hunting lodge by order of Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg. The Renaissance style building was located on an island adjacent to the old town at the site of the former medieval fort. Joachim II died here in 1571. In 1631 it served as the headquarters of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, where in vain he beseeched his brother-in-law Elector George William for assistance to his doomed campaign during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

From 1677, Frederick I of Prussia had the hunting lodge rebuilt and enlarged. He then took residence here with his first wife Elizabeth Henrietta of Hesse-Kassel. In 1730 Frederick II of Prussia, then Crown Prince, and his friend Hans Hermann von Katte faced court-martial for desertion at Schloss Köpenick. Today the palace serves as a museum of decorative art run by the Berlin State Museums and is surrounded by a small park, which also contains a Calvinist chapel.

==Culture==
&quot;Köpenick Summer&quot; (Köpenicker Sommer) is an annual street festival which featuring music, shows and a festival parade led by the Captain of Köpenick (Hauptmann von Köpenick).

==Transport==
Both the rivers Dahme and Spree are navigable. The Spree connects Köpenick with the Havel and hence the waterway systems of western and central Germany. The Dahme links to the Oder-Spree Canal at nearby Schmöckwitz, thus providing a navigable connection to Eisenhüttenstadt, the Oder river and thus the Baltic Sea and Silesia.

Köpenick is served by Köpenick, Wuhlheide and Hirschgarten stations on the S3 line of the Berlin S-Bahn network, and by the Spindlersfeld terminus of S47 line. Köpenick is also a node on the Berlin tram network, with routes 27, 60, 61, 62, 63, 67 and 68 serving its neighbourhoods.

==Sport==
The Stadion An der Alten Försterei is home of the 1. FC Union Berlin football club.

Mellowpark is the biggest outdoor skatepark in Europe.

Grünau hosted the 1936 Olympic rowing competitions, and many athletes had lodgings there and nearby, like the American 8-man rowing team as described in Daniel James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Boys in the Boat&quot;.

<doc id="409133" wikidata="Q356954" url="?curid=409133" title="List of political parties in Uruguay">
<text>[[Uruguay]] has a [[multi-party system]] with three dominant political parties, with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party. It may be said that to some extent the &#x27;fault lines&#x27; of Uruguay&#x27;s politics have run within the historically dominant Colorado and National parties. Uruguay underwent an intermittent series of civil wars through much of the 19th century, which ended in 1904, and the party system has in the past reflected regional loyalties which emerged during that period. However, with the eclipse in 2004 of the Colorado Party and, indeed, the cooperation of the Colorado and National parties during the 1999 Presidential elections, some realignment of traditional loyalties has come into play. However, the independence of both parties is maintained by members of Colorado and National parties.

The participation of leading figures from both the Colorado and the National parties in the civilian-military administrations of 1973-1985 may have played a role in causing long-term traditional party loyalties to shift somewhat. Critics of these two parties may argue that they have to some extent been compromised with the past willingness of some of their prominent members to work with the civilian-military administrations of 1973-1985. Supporters may argue that in the difficult circumstances of the years in question such participation as was afforded by Colorado and National members to the civilian-military administrations was against the background of political figures (from both EP-FA-NM and National parties, such as Liber Seregni and Wilson Ferreira Aldunate) who were exiled and/or incarcerated, thus playing no part at all in the country&#x27;s affairs until circumstances were more fortuitous for them. Furthermore, Ferreira Aldunate and Seregni were banned from participating in the first &quot;return to democracy&quot; elections of 1984, where Julio María Sanguinetti was elected.

Economic problems also may have substantially contributed to the Uruguayan electorate&#x27;s willingness in 2004 to move away from the traditional parties.

Factionalism is strong in all of Uruguay&#x27;s major parties. The Broad Front is in fact a coalition of autonomous political parties that vary in ideological outlook, while the Colorado and National parties are also composed of divergent factions with autonomous identities within those parties.

<doc id="409138" wikidata="Q100274852" url="?curid=409138" title="Political parties in Ukraine">
<text>This article presents the historical development and role of political parties in Ukrainian politics, and outlines more extensively the significant modern political parties since Ukraine gained independence in 1991.

==Overview==
Ukraine has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. In the (October 2014) Ukrainian parliamentary election 52 political parties nominated candidates. In the nationwide (October 2015) local elections this number had grown to 132 political parties.

Many parties in Ukraine have very small memberships and are unknown to the general public. Party membership in Ukraine is lower than 1% of the population eligible to vote (compared to an average 4.7% in the European Union). National parties currently not represented in Ukraine&#x27;s national parliament Verkhovna Rada do have representatives in municipal councils. Small parties used to join in multi-party coalitions (electoral blocks) for the purpose of participating in parliamentary elections, but on November 17, 2011, the Ukrainian Parliament approved an election law that banned the participation of blocs of political parties in parliamentary elections. Ukrainian society&#x27;s trust of political parties is very low overall. According to an April 2014 poll by Razumkov Centre 14.7%. According to a February 2020 poll by again Razumkov Centre, more than 70% of respondents said they rather or completely did not trust political parties.

The Ukrainian oligarchs play a key role in sponsoring of political parties and participation in every day politics.

==Legal framework==
Parties can only register with the Ministry of Justice if they can &quot;demonstrate a base of support in two-thirds of Ukraine&#x27;s Oblasts&quot; (Ukraine&#x27;s 24 primary administrative units) and in two-thirds of the raions of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. This means that 10,000 signatures needs to be collected in these areas. Including in Crimea, although Ukraine lost control of this territory in 2014 (to Russia). (The only way to fulfill this norm is to get signatures of Ukrainian citizens living elsewhere in Ukraine with Crimean residence.) Then within six months the party must establish regional offices in a majority of the 24 oblasts. In practice these offices rarely stay active and open in-between elections. Because of the procedural difficulties of registering a party the practice of renaming existing political forces is widespread. (For instance, from January to September 2020 50 parties changed their name.) In practice this means that long career politicians in Ukraine regularly switch to a new party.

10 years in a row not nominating candidates for national parliamentary and presidential elections is a legal ground for liquidating a party.

Ukraine’s election law forbids outside financing of political parties or campaigns.

All data on any legal political parties as any other public organizations in Ukraine is kept at the Single Registry (, &quot;Yedynyi reyestr hromadskykh formuvan&quot;), with online version of which provided by the Ministry of Justice. On 1 January 2020 349 political parties were in this register.

==Major parties and political camps==
There have developed two major movements in the Ukrainian parliament since its independence:
*A pro-Western and pro-European general liberal national democrats who from time to time featured individual politicians with a nationalist past (for example Andriy Shkil, Andriy Parubiy and Levko Lukyanenko) with the Our Ukraine Blocs and Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko (now Fatherland) as its frontrunners; UDAR replaced the Our Ukraine Bloc in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election. In the 2014 parliamentary election UDAR did not participate but its members filled 30% of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc election list. The Petro Poroshenko Bloc won the election with 132 seats.
*A pro-Russian, latently Eurosceptic, often anti-American and partly anti-liberal group of parties, which in the 1990s was dominated by the Communist Party of Ukraine, and was dominated by the Party of Regions from the late 2000s until the party disintegrated shortly after the Revolution of Dignity.

The first movement (mentioned above) gets its voters mainly from Western Ukraine and Central Ukraine; the latter from Eastern Ukraine and Southern Ukraine.


==Ideology==
Ukrainian parties tend not to have a clear ideology but to contain different political groups with diverging ideological outlooks. Unlike in Western politics, civilizational and geostrategic orientations play a more important role than economic and socio-political agendas for parties. An example is the membership of the social-democratic Batkivshchyna party in the economically liberal European People&#x27;s Party. This has led to coalition governments that would be unusual from a Western point of view; for example: the first Azarov government included the Party of Regions, the centrist Lytvyn Bloc and the Communist Party of Ukraine.

==Particularity of parties in Ukraine==
Professor Paul D&#x27;Anieri has argued (in 2006) that Ukrainian parties are &quot;elite-based rather than mass-based,&quot; while former Ambassador of Germany to Ukraine (2000–2006) Dietmar Stüdemann from Embassy of Germany, Kyiv believes that personalities are more important in Ukrainian politics than (ideological) platforms. &quot;Parties in the proper meaning of this word do not exist in Ukraine so far. A party for Germans is its platform first, and its personalities later.&quot;

==History==
===Independent Ukraine, party forming (early 1990s)===
Even before Ukraine became independent in August 1991, political parties in Ukraine started to form around intellectuals and former Soviet dissidents. They posed the main opposition to the ruling Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine (CP(b)U). At the first convocation of the Verkhovna Rada those parties formed the parliamentary opposition People&#x27;s Council. The most noticeable parties of the parliamentary opposition included the People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine (The Movement) and the Ukrainian Republican Party. Due to the August Putsch in Moscow (19–21 August 1991), a process to prohibit communist parties in Ukraine took place. Led by Oleksandr Moroz, the parliamentary faction of the CP(b)U, Group of 239, started a process to re-form the CP(b)U into the Socialist Party of Ukraine. The restriction on the existence of communist parties in Ukraine was successfully adopted soon after the Ukrainian independence, however in the couple of years the resolution was later challenged and eventually the restriction was lifted. In 1993 in Donetsk the first congress of the reinstated Communist Party of Ukraine took place, with the Party led by Petro Symonenko.

In the hastily organized 1994 parliamentary elections the communists surprisingly achieved the highest party rating, while the main opposing party, the Movement, did not gain even a quarter of their earned seats. The re-formed party of the CP(b)U, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, and its major ally, the Peasant Party of Ukraine, performed relatively strongly. About a third of the elected parliamentarians were not affiliated. The elections became a major fiasco of the Democratic forces in Ukraine. After the 1994 elections numerous independent political parties were elected to the Ukrainian parliament, leading to the formation of nine deputy groups and parliamentary factions: Communists, Socialists, Agrarians, Inter-regional Deputy Group (MDG), Unity, Center, Statehood, Reforms, and the Movement. The concept of a &quot;situational majority&quot; was first used during that convocation to form a parliamentary coalition. The ruling coalition in the parliament often included the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, Agrarians, MDG, and Unity.

===Parties for oligarchs and clans (1994–2004)===
During the Kuchma presidency (1994–2004) parties started to form around politicians who had achieved power; these parties were often a vehicle of Ukrainian oligarchs. Scholars defined several &quot;Clans&quot; in Ukrainian politics grouped around businessmen and politicians from particular Ukrainian mayor cities; the &quot;Donetsk Clan&quot; (Rinat Akhmetov, Viktor Yanukovych and Mykola Azarov), the &quot;Dnipropetrovsk Clan&quot; (Yulia Tymoshenko, Leonid Kuchma, Victor Pinchuk, Serhiy Tihipko and Pavlo Lazarenko), the &quot;Kyiv Clan&quot; (Viktor Medvedchuk and the Surkis brothers; this clan has also been linked to Zakarpattia) and the smaller &quot;Kharkiv Clan&quot;.

After the 2002 elections the Ukrainian parliament saw some consolidation of democratic political parties and the establishment of the main political camps in Ukraine: a coalition of nationally oriented deputies with the pro-European vector, a coalition of left-wing parties, and the pro-Russian parties coalition of the former Soviet nomenklatura. A major change took place during the Orange revolution when finally the two opposing political camps were established after the left-wing coalition split.

===Mergers and bans (2011–present)===
On 17 November 2011 the Ukrainian Parliament approved an election law that banned the participation of blocs of political parties in parliamentary elections; since then several parties have merged with other parties. Strong Ukraine merged with the Party of Regions on 17 March 2012. Front of Changes and former Our Ukraine Bloc and Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko members performed in the 2012 parliamentary elections under &quot;umbrella&quot; party Fatherland. Front for Changes leader Yatsenyuk headed this election list; because Fatherland-leader Yulia Tymoshenko was imprisoned.

On 15 June 2013 Reforms and Order Party and Front for Change merged into Fatherland. A part of People’s Movement of Ukraine (including its former chairman Borys Tarasyuk) also merged with Fatherland (the rest of this party had merged with Ukrainian People&#x27;s Party in May 2013).

In preparation for the upcoming 2014 parliamentary elections, several ministers of the Fatherland party in the government of Arseniy Yatsenyuk moved to the new party People&#x27;s Front, which elected as its party leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk on 10 September 2014.

UDAR merged into the Petro Poroshenko Bloc on 28 August 2015 after in the 2014 parliamentary election, 30% of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc election list had been filled by members of UDAR (as non-partisan).

On 20 March 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a ban on 11 political parties for alleged ties with Russia: Opposition Platform — For Life, Party of Shariy, Nashi, Opposition Bloc, Left Opposition, Union of Left Forces, Derzhava, Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, Socialist Party of Ukraine, Socialists and Volodymyr Saldo Bloc.

On 20 June 2024, also Our Land party was banned with the accusation of the Security Service of Ukraine of subversive activities against State, bringing to 19 the number of banned parties since the beginning of the Russian invasion.

<doc id="409139" wikidata="Q6634268" url="?curid=409139" title="List of political parties in Uganda">
<text>This article lists political parties in Uganda. Until a constitutional referendum in July 2005, only one political organization, the Movement (also called the National Resistance Movement) was allowed to operate in Uganda. The president, who also chairs the Movement, maintained that the Movement was not a political party, but a mass organization that claimed the loyalty of all Ugandans.

Until the 2005 referendum, the 1995 constitution had required the suspension of political parties while the Movement organization was in governance. Other political parties could technically exist but were prohibited from sponsoring candidates and holding meetings.

Registered political parties are now allowed to operate openly and contest elections. However, sometimes they find hardship in practicing their rights by the party in power.

==Active political parties==

<text>Djibouti is a one party dominant state with the People&#x27;s Rally for Progress currently in power. There are currently no opposition members in the National Assembly, partially because of the rule that the party or coalition with a majority vote in each district wins all of that district&#x27;s seats . This voting system is seen to facilitate the dominance of the pro-presidential coalition. The main opposition coalitions are the Union for Democratic Change (UAD) and Union for Democratic Movements (UMD).

<doc id="409149" wikidata="Q472503" url="?curid=409149" title="Herb Elliott">
<text>Herbert James Elliott (born 25 February 1938) is a former Australian athlete and arguably the world&#x27;s greatest middle distance runner of his era. In August 1958 he set the world record in the mile run, clocking 3:54.5, 2.7 seconds under the record held by Derek Ibbotson; later in the month he set the 1500 metres world record, running 3:36.0, 2.1 seconds under the record held by Stanislav Jungwirth. In the 1500 metres at the 1960 Rome Olympics, he won the gold medal and bettered his own world record with a time of 3:35.6.

Herb Elliot never lost a mile run and accomplished 36 wins over this distance. During his career, he broke four minutes for the mile on 17 occasions. Only David Richards came close to beating him.

Elliott retired from athletics soon after the 1960 Olympics, at the age of 22. He made a career in business, and at one time was chairman of Fortescue Metals Group. He was also chairman of Global Corporate Challenge health initiative.

==Biography==
Elliott was born on 25 February 1938 at Kensington Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, to Herb and Eileen Elliott, née Carmody. He attended Aquinas College, Perth, where he was Head Prefect in the Class of 1955. The intense sporting culture at Aquinas provided an ideal grounding for Elliott to reach the highest levels of athletic achievement.

On 6 August 1958, Elliott set a new world record for the mile (3:54.5) at Morton Stadium in Dublin. Later that month he broke the 1500 metres world record in Gothenburg with a time of 3:36.0. His closest Australian rival at the time was Merv Lincoln.

===Commonwealth and Olympic Games===
At the 1958 Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales, he won gold in the 880 yards and the mile. Two years later, at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Elliott won the 1500 m gold medal in world record time (3:35.6), finishing 2.6 seconds ahead of second placed Michel Jazy of France.

Elliott credited his visionary and iconoclastic coach, Percy Cerutty, with inspiration to train harder and more naturally than anyone of his era. Cerutty was known to avoid the track, talk about role models outside athletics (such as Leonardo da Vinci and Jesus), and bring his athletes to the unspoiled seaside beauty of Portsea training camp south of Melbourne, where Elliott would sprint up sand dunes until he dropped. &quot;Faster&quot;, Cerutty would say, &quot;it&#x27;s only pain.&quot;

===University education===
Elliott originally studied at the University of Melbourne, where he was funded by a Shell Australia university scholarship. After winning in Rome in 1960, he started a further degree course in natural sciences at the University of Cambridge, having been awarded another scholarship by Shell at the behest of Lewis Luxton, an executive at the company who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 Boat Race. Elliott matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge, and received a third class in Part I of the natural sciences tripos in 1963. He retired from athletics after running the half-mile in the 1962 University v AAA match. During his years at Cambridge Elliott lived outside of college, residing with his family in a house in Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire.

===Business===
Elliott served as the CEO of Puma North America and between 2001 and 2006 as a board member at Ansell. From May 2005, he served as deputy chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, the world&#x27;s fifth largest iron ore miner by capacity, and was the non-executive chairman of the firm from March 2007. On 18 August 2011, Elliott was expected to move from chairman to deputy chairman, handing over the role of chairman to Andrew Forrest.

===Sydney Olympics===
Elliott was one of the Olympic Torch bearers at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, and entered the stadium for the final segment before the lighting of the Olympic Flame.

===Family===

On 2 May 1959, Elliott married Anne Dudley, a hairdresser from Perth. They have six children.

==Honours==
Elliott carried the torch of peace to the MCG when Pope John Paul II visited Melbourne in 1986.

His career inspired the 1962 Australian television play &quot;The Runner&quot; written by Alan Seymour.

In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List of 1964, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List of 2002, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), to wit:For service to community leadership through the development of sport in Australia, continuing involvement in the Olympic movement at national and international levels, and as a supporter and benefactor of community and charitable organisations for youth, health promotion and cultural understanding.

He is an Australian Living Treasure.

He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985.

Fortescue Metals Group named a new port at Point Anderson (near Port Hedland, Western Australia) for him.

<doc id="409151" wikidata="Q6634265" url="?curid=409151" title="List of political parties in Tanzania">
<text>This article lists political parties in Tanzania. The country operates under a dominant multi-party system with the ruling party being in power since the nation attained its independence in 1961. It first governed as the Tanganyika African National Union, before merging with the Afro-Shirazi Party to form the Chama Cha Mapinduzi.

==Brief history and overview==
Tanzania attained its independence as Tanganyika Territory from the United Kingdom in 1961 with the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) forming its first government. Following the Zanzibar Revolution in 1964, it merged with the People&#x27;s Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar (present day Tanzania). It thereafter became a one-party state with TANU and the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP) being the only parties operating on the mainland and the Zanzibar Archipelago respectively.

On 5 February 1977, TANU merged with its Zanzibari counterpart, the ASP to form the Chama Cha Mapinduzi which served as the sole legal party until 1992 when multi-party system was re-introduced. The country also adopted the Structural Adjustment Program upon recommendation of the Bretton Woods Institutions.

Since the re-introduction of the multi-party system, the CCM has continued to retain its popularity and the voter&#x27;s confidence, having won all general elections since 1995. Jakaya Kikwete, the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in 2005 won the election by a landslide victory receiving more than 80% of the popular vote.

<text>Croatia participated in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest five times, and won the inaugural edition in . Croatian broadcaster (HRT), a member organisation of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), were responsible for the country&#x27;s participation. Croatia participated in the first four editions, from 2003 to 2006, organising a national final to select the country&#x27;s entrant. The first representative to participate for Croatia was Dino Jelusić with the song &quot;&quot;, which finished in first place out of sixteen participating entries, with a score of 134 points. Croatia was absent from the contest between 2007 and 2013, but HRT decided to return to the contest in and selected their entry internally. In 2014, Josie finished in last place for Croatia with the song &quot;Game Over&quot;, after which HRT again withdrew from competing the following year.

==History==
Croatia are one of the sixteen countries to have made their debut at the inaugural Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2003, which took place on 15 November 2003 at the Forum in Copenhagen, Denmark. After problems occurred with the prospective host for the 2004 contest, Croatian broadcaster Hrvatska radiotelevizija (HRT) stepped in to host the contest. However, this was later abandoned after it was revealed the venue HRT had planned on using for the contest was to be in use during the period of the contest. HRT was one of six other broadcasters to enter a bid to host the 2005 contest, however this was unsuccessful. Croatia also expressed an interest in hosting the 2006 contest and made another unsuccessful bid to host the 2007 contest.

HRT withdrew from the 2007 contest, due to expense and difficulties in broadcasting the contest live. In October 2007, the broadcaster was fined 10,000 Swiss francs for breaching the rules of the 2006 contest by not broadcasting the show live on one of their main terrestrial channels despite initially declaring it would do so, and instead decided at the last minute to broadcast it only on satellite channel HRT Plus which was not widely available in the country; consequently a reserve jury had to take the place of the televoting. A recording of the contest was later aired, in a late evening slot, on a main channel. The broadcaster had sent several requests to the EBU to move the show to an earlier time slot, using 17:00 as an example and also asked for permission to broadcast the contest in a delayed time slot more convenient for its programming schedule but these requests were declined. The EBU would later relax the rule ahead of the 2007 contest.

On 23 September 2014, it was announced that Croatia could possibly return to the 2014 contest in Marsa, Malta due to a tweet composed by the Executive Supervisor of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, Vladislav Yakovlev. Their return was officially confirmed by the EBU on 26 September 2014, with the 2014 contest being scheduled to be broadcast on HRT 2. On 23 June 2015, it was announced that HRT would withdraw from the 2015 contest, leaving Croatia out of the edition which took place in Bulgaria. On 17 August 2016, HRT ruled out a return to the 2016 contest. On 20 May 2017, the Croatian broadcaster announced their ambitions to return to the 2017 contest in Tbilisi. However, Croatia was not on the final list of participants released by the EBU and did not compete in the contest.

On 3 November 2024, the broadcaster published a programme schedule for the day of the 2024 contest which shows that HRT intends to broadcast the contest live on HRT 2 for the first time in a decade. A few days later the Croatian Head of Delegation for Eurovision, Tomislav Štengl confirmed on &quot;&quot; that the broadcaster was evaluating a potential return to the contest in 2025 and invisioned that the inaugural winner of the upcoming kids version of &quot;The Voice Hrvatska&quot; would be the chosen representative.

During the Ba&#x27;athist regime, anyone was allowed to start a new political party but it cannot be founded on ethnic, religious, regional or tribal basis.
