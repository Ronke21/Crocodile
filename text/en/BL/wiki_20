<text>Aristotle&#x27;s Poetics ( &quot;Peri poietikês&quot;; ; ) is the earliest surviving work of Greek dramatic theory and the first extant philosophical treatise to solely focus on literary theory. In this text, Aristotle offers an account of , which refers to poetry, and more literally, &quot;the poetic art&quot;, deriving from the term for &quot;poet; author; maker&quot;, . Aristotle divides the art of poetry into verse drama (comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play), lyric poetry, and epic. The genres all share the function of mimesis, or imitation of life, but differ in three ways that Aristotle describes:
# There are differences in music rhythm, harmony, meter, and melody.
# There is a difference of goodness in the characters.
# A difference exists in how the narrative is presented: telling a story or acting it out.

The surviving book of &quot;Poetics&quot; is primarily concerned with drama; the analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion.

Although the text is universally acknowledged in the Western critical tradition, &quot;almost every detail about this seminal work has aroused divergent opinions.&quot; Of scholarly debates on the &quot;Poetics&quot;, four have been most prominent. These include the meanings of catharsis and hamartia, the Classical unities, and the question why Aristotle appears to contradict himself between chapters 13 and 14.

==Background==

Aristotle&#x27;s work on aesthetics consists of the &quot;Poetics&quot;, &quot;Politics&quot; (Bk VIII), and &quot;Rhetoric&quot;. The &quot;Poetics&quot; was lost to the Western world for a long time. The text was restored to the West in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance only through a Latin translation of an Arabic version written by Averroes. The accurate Greek-Latin translation made by William of Moerbeke in 1278 was virtually ignored. At some point during antiquity, the original text of the &quot;Poetics&quot; was divided in two, each &quot;book&quot; written on a separate roll of papyrus. Only the first part—that which focuses on tragedy and epic (as a quasi-dramatic art, given its definition in Ch. 23)—survives. The lost second part addressed comedy. Some scholars speculate that the &quot;Tractatus coislinianus&quot; summarises the contents of the lost second book.

==Overview==
The table of contents page of the &quot;Poetics&quot; found in Modern Library&#x27;s &quot;Basic Works of Aristotle&quot; (2001) identifies five basic parts within it.
Aristotle also draws a famous distinction between the tragic mode of poetry and the type of history-writing practiced among the Greeks. Whereas history deals with things that took place in the past, tragedy concerns itself with what might occur, or could be imagined to happen. History deals with particulars, whose relation to one another is marked by contingency, accident, or chance. Contrariwise, poetic narratives are determined objects, unified by a plot whose logic binds up the constituent elements by necessity and probability. In this sense, he concluded, such poetry was more philosophical than history was in so far as it approximates to a knowledge of universals.

==Synopsis==

Aristotle distinguishes between the genres of &quot;poetry&quot; in three ways:
* Matter
::Language, rhythm, and melody, for Aristotle, make up the matter of poetic creation. Where the epic poem makes use of language alone, the playing of the lyre involves rhythm and melody. Some poetic forms include a blending of all materials; for example, Greek tragic drama included a singing chorus, and so music and language were all part of the performance. These points also convey . Recent work, though, argues that translating &quot;rhuthmos&quot; here as &quot;rhythm&quot; is absurd: melody already has its own inherent musical rhythm, and the Greek can mean what Plato says it means in &quot;Laws&quot; II, 665a: &quot;(the name of) ordered body movement,&quot; or dance. This correctly conveys what dramatic musical creation, the topic of the &quot;Poetics&quot;, in ancient Greece had: music, dance, and language. Also, the musical instrument cited in Ch. 1 is not the lyre but the &quot;kithara&quot;, which was played in the drama while the kithara-player was dancing (in the chorus), even if that meant just walking in an appropriate way. Moreover, epic might have had only literary exponents, but as Plato&#x27;s &quot;Ion&quot; and Aristotle&#x27;s Ch. 26 of the &quot;Poetics&quot; help prove, for Plato and Aristotle at least some epic rhapsodes used all three means of mimesis: language, dance (as pantomimic gesture), and music (if only by chanting the words).
* Subjects
::(Also &quot;agents&quot; in some translations.) Aristotle differentiates between tragedy and comedy throughout the work by distinguishing between the nature of the human characters that populate either form. Aristotle finds that tragedy deals with serious, important, and virtuous people. Comedy, on the other hand, treats of less virtuous people and focuses on human &quot;weaknesses and foibles&quot;. Aristotle introduces here the influential &quot;tripartite division of characters&quot;: superior (βελτίονας) to the audience, inferior (χείρονας), or at the same level (τοιούτους).
* Method
::One may imitate the agents through use of a narrator throughout, or only occasionally (using direct speech in parts and a narrator in parts, as Homer does), or only through direct speech (without a narrator), using actors to speak the lines directly. This latter is the method of tragedy (and comedy): without use of any narrator.

Having examined briefly the field of &quot;poetry&quot; in general, Aristotle proceeds to his definition of tragedy:
Tragedy is a representation of a serious, complete action which has magnitude, in embellished speech, with each of its elements [used] separately in the [various] parts [of the play] and [represented] by people acting and not by narration, accomplishing by means of pity and terror the catharsis of such emotions.

By &quot;embellished speech&quot;, I mean that which has rhythm and melody, i.e. song. By &quot;with its elements separately&quot;, I mean that some [parts of it] are accomplished only by means of spoken verses, and others again by means of song.

He then identifies the &quot;parts&quot; of tragedy:

* plot (&quot;mythos&quot;)
::Refers to the &quot;organization of incidents&quot;. It should imitate an action that evokes pity and fear. The plot involves a change from bad towards good, or good towards bad. Complex plots have reversals and recognitions. These and suffering (or violence) evoke the tragic emotions. The most tragic plot pushes a good character towards undeserved misfortune because of a mistake (&quot;hamartia&quot;). Plots revolving around such a mistake are more tragic than plots with two sides and an opposite outcome for the good and the bad. Violent situations are most tragic if they are between friends and family. Threats can be resolved by being done in knowledge, done in ignorance and then discovered, or almost done in ignorance but discovered at the last moment.

::Actions should follow logically from the situation created by what has happened before, and from the character of the agent. This goes for recognitions and reversals as well, as even surprises are more satisfying to the audience if they afterwards are seen as a plausible or necessary consequence.

* character (&quot;ethos&quot;)
::Aristotle defines a tragedy as entertaining by satisfying the moral sense and imitating actions which &quot;excite pity and fear&quot;. The success of a tragedy in calling forth these qualities is revealed through the moral character of the agents, which is revealed through the actions and choices of the agent. In a perfect tragedy, the character will support the plot, which means personal motivations and traits will somehow connect parts of the cause-and-effect chain of actions producing pity and fear.
::The main character should be:
::* good— a character must be between the two extremes of morality, they must simply be good. A character should not be on either of the moral extremities. To follow a character of virtue from prosperity to adversity merely serves to shock the audience; yet to follow them from adversity to prosperity is a story of triumph which satisfies the moral sense but ignores the excitement of fear and pity altogether. To follow a villain from prosperity to adversity will undoubtedly satisfy the moral sense, but it once again ignores the tragic qualities of fear and pity. On the other hand, a villain going from adversity to prosperity possesses no tragic qualities at all, neither satisfying the moral sense nor exciting fear and pity.
::* appropriate—if a character is supposed to be wise, it is unlikely he is young (supposing wisdom is gained with age).
::* consistent—as the actions of a character should follow the Law of Probability and Necessity, they must be written to be internally consistent. When applied, the Law of Probability and Necessity defines it as necessary for a character to react and as probable for them to react in a certain way. To be truly realistic, these reactions must be true and expected for the character. As such, they must be internally consistent. 
::* &quot;consistently inconsistent&quot;—if a character always behaves foolishly it is strange if he suddenly becomes intelligent. In this case it would be good to explain such the cause of such a change, otherwise the audience may be confused. If a character changes their opinion a lot it should be made clear that this is a trait of the character.
* thought (&quot;dianoia&quot;)—spoken (usually) reasoning of human characters can explain the characters or story background.
* diction (&quot;lexis&quot;)—Lexis is better translated, according to some, as &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;language&quot;. Otherwise, the relevant necessary condition stemming from &quot;logos&quot; in the definition (language) has no followup: mythos (plot) could be done by dancers or pantomime artists, given chapters 1, 2, and 4, if the actions are structured (on stage, as drama was usually done), just like plot for us can be given in film or in a story-ballet with no words.
::Refers to the quality of speech in tragedy. Speeches should reflect character: the moral qualities of those on the stage. The expression of the meaning of the words.
* melody (&quot;melos&quot;)—&quot;Melos&quot; can also mean &quot;music-dance&quot;, especially given that its primary meaning in ancient Greek is &quot;limb&quot; (an arm or a leg). This is arguably more sensible because then Aristotle is conveying what the chorus actually did.
::The Chorus should be written as one of the actors. As such, It should be an integral part of the whole: taking a share in the action and contributing to the unity of the plot. It is a factor in the pleasure of the drama.
* spectacle (&quot;opsis&quot;)
::Refers to the visual apparatus of the play, including set, costumes, and props (anything you can see). Aristotle calls spectacle the &quot;least artistic&quot; element of tragedy, and the For example: if the play has &quot;beautiful&quot; costumes and &quot;bad&quot; acting and &quot;bad&quot; story, there is &quot;something wrong&quot; with it. Even though that &quot;beauty&quot; may save the play it is &quot;not a nice thing&quot;.

He offers the earliest-surviving explanation for the origins of tragedy and comedy:
Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities)...
==Influence==

The Arabic version of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; that influenced the Middle Ages was translated from a Greek manuscript dated to some time prior to the year 700. This manuscript, translated from Greek to Syriac, is independent of the currently-accepted 11th-century source designated &quot;Paris 1741&quot;. The Syriac-language source used for the Arabic translations departed widely in vocabulary from the original &quot;Poetics&quot; and it initiated a misinterpretation of Aristotelian thought that continued through the Middle Ages.

The scholars who published significant commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; included Avicenna, Al-Farabi, and Averroes. Many of these interpretations sought to use Aristotelian theory to impose morality on the Arabic poetic tradition. In particular, Averroes added a moral dimension to the &quot;Poetics&quot; by interpreting tragedy as the art of praise and comedy as the art of blame. Averroes&#x27; interpretation of the &quot;Poetics&quot; was accepted by the West, where it reflected the &quot;prevailing notions of poetry&quot; the 16th century.

Giorgio Valla&#x27;s 1498 Latin translation of Aristotle&#x27;s text (the first to be published) was included with the 1508 Aldine printing of the Greek original as part of an anthology of &quot;Rhetores graeci&quot;. By the early decades of the sixteenth century, vernacular versions of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; appeared, culminating in Lodovico Castelvetro&#x27;s Italian editions of 1570 and 1576. Italian culture produced the great Renaissance commentators on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, and in the baroque period Emanuele Tesauro, with his &quot;Cannocchiale aristotelico&quot;, re-presented to the world of post-Galilean physics Aristotle&#x27;s poetic theories as the sole key to approaching the human sciences.

Recent scholarship has challenged whether Aristotle focuses on literary theory per se (given that not one poem exists in the treatise) or whether he focuses instead on dramatic musical theory that only has language as one of the elements.

The lost second book of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; is a core plot element in Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;.

<doc id="397066" wikidata="Q572511" url="?curid=397066" title="Slavery in Canada">
<text>Slavery in Canada includes historical practices of enslavement practised by both the First Nations until the latter half of the 19th century, and by colonists during the period of European colonization.

The practice of slavery in Canada by colonists effectively ended early in the 19th century, through local statutes and court decisions resulting from litigation on behalf of enslaved people seeking manumission. The courts, to varying degrees, rendered slavery unenforceable in both Lower Canada and Nova Scotia. In Lower Canada, for example, after court decisions in the late 1790s, the &quot;slave could not be compelled to serve longer than he would, and ... might leave his master at will.&quot; Upper Canada passed the Act Against Slavery in 1793, one of the earliest anti-slavery acts in the world. These developments in Canada preceded Britain&#x27;s decision to ban slavery through most of the British Empire by passing the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.

As slavery in the United States continued until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, black people (free and enslaved) began immigrating to Canada from the United States after the American Revolution and again after the War of 1812, and later many by way of the Underground Railroad.

Because Canada&#x27;s role in the Atlantic slave trade was comparatively limited, the history of Black slavery in Canada is often overshadowed by the more tumultuous slavery practised elsewhere in the Americas. 

==Under Indigenous rule==
Slave-owning people of what became Canada were, for example, the fishing societies such as the Yurok, that lived along the Pacific coast from Alaska to California, on what is sometimes described as the Pacific or Northern Northwest Coast. Some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, such as the Haida and Tlingit, were traditionally known as fierce warriors and slave-traders, raiding as far as California. Slavery was hereditary, the slaves being prisoners of war and their descendants were slaves. In what became British Columbia, slavery was flourishing in the 1830s, gradually declining throughout the century. In the 1870s, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Israel Wood Powell, freed slaves on their appeal to him during his trips to the west coast of Vancouver Island. Slavery had virtually ended by the 1880s and 1890s. Some nations in British Columbia continued to segregate and ostracize the descendants of slaves as late as the 1970s. Among a few Pacific Northwest nations about a quarter of the population were slaves.

One slave narrative was composed by an Englishman, John R. Jewitt. He had been taken alive when his ship was captured in 1802 by the Nuu-chah-nulth people due to the ship&#x27;s captain having insulted their chief, Maquinna, and other slights inflicted against their people by other American and European captains. Jewitt&#x27;s memoir provides a detailed look at life as a slave.

==Under European colonization==
The historian Marcel Trudel estimates that there were fewer than 4,200 slaves in the area of Canada (New France) and later the Canadas between 1671 and 1831. Around two-thirds of these slaves were of Indigenous ancestry 
(2,700 typically called &quot;panis&quot;, from the French term for Pawnee) and one third were of African descent (1,443). They were house servants and farm workers. The number of Black slaves increased during British rule, especially with the arrival of United Empire Loyalists after 1783. The Maritimes saw 1,200 to 2,000 slaves arrive prior to abolition, with 300 accounted for in Lower Canada, and between 500 and 700 in Upper Canada. A small portion of Black Canadians today are descended from these slaves.

People of African descent were forcibly captured by local chiefs and kings as chattel slaves and sold to traders bound for southern areas of the Americas. Those in what is now called Canada typically came from the American colonies, as no shiploads of human chattel went to Canada directly from Africa. There were no large plantations in Canada, and therefore no demand for a large slave work force of the sort that existed in most European colonies in the Americas. Nevertheless, slaves in Canada were subjected to the same physical, psychological, and sexual violence and abuse as their American counterparts.

===Under French rule===
Under French rule, enslaved First Nations people outnumbered enslaved individuals of African descent. According to Afua Cooper, author of &quot;The Hanging of Angélique: The Untold Story of Canadian Slavery and the Burning of Old Montréal&quot;, this was due to the relative ease with which New France could acquire First Nations slaves. She noted that the mortality of slaves was high, with the average age of First Nations slaves only 17, and the average age of slaves of African descent, 25. One of the first recorded Black slaves in Canada was brought by a British convoy to New France in 1628. Olivier le Jeune was the name given to the boy, originally from Madagascar.

By 1688, New France&#x27;s population was 11,562 people, made up primarily of fur traders, missionaries, and farmers settled in the St. Lawrence Valley. To help overcome its severe shortage of servants and labourers, King Louis XIV granted New France&#x27;s petition to import Black slaves from West Africa. Though no shipments ever arrived from Africa, colonists did acquire some Black slaves from other French and British colonies. From the late 1600s, they also acquired Indigenous slaves, mostly from what is now the U.S. Midwestern states, through their western fur-trade networks. Slaves of Indigenous origin were called &quot;Panis&quot;, but few came from the Pawnee tribe. More commonly, they were of Fox, Dakota, Iowa, and Apache origin, captives taken in war by Indigenous allies and trading partners of the French.
While slavery was prohibited in France, it was permitted in its colonies as a means of providing the massive labour force needed to clear land, construct buildings and (in the Caribbean colonies) work on sugar, indigo and tobacco plantations. The 1685 &quot;Code Noir&quot; set the pattern for policing slavery in the West Indies. It required that all slaves be instructed as Catholics and not as Protestants. It concentrated on defining the condition of slavery, and established harsh controls. Slaves had virtually no rights, though the Code did enjoin masters to take care of the sick and old. The &quot;Code noir&quot; does not seem to have applied to Canada and so, in 1709, the intendant Jacques Raudot issued an ordinance officially recognizing slavery in New France; slavery existed before that date, but only as of 1709 was it instituted in law.

One slave is well-recorded in the history of Montreal: Marie-Joseph Angélique was held in slavery by a rich widow in that city. In 1734, after learning that she was going to be sold and separated from her lover, Angélique set fire to her owner&#x27;s house and escaped. The fire raged out of control, destroying forty-six buildings. Captured two months later, Angélique was paraded through the city, then tortured until she confessed her crime. In the afternoon of the day of execution, Angélique was taken through the streets of Montreal and, after the stop at the church for her &quot;amende honorable&quot;, made to climb a scaffold facing the ruins of the buildings destroyed by the fire. There she was hanged until dead, with her body flung into the fire and the ashes scattered in the wind.

Historian Marcel Trudel recorded approximately 4,000 slaves by the end of New France in 1759, of which 2,472 were Indigenous people, and 1,132 were Black. After the Conquest of New France by the British, slave ownership remained dominated by the French. Trudel identified 1,509 slave owners, of which only 181 were English. Trudel also noted 31 marriages took place between French colonists and Indigenous slaves.

===Under British rule===

First Nations owned or traded in slaves, an institution that had existed for centuries or longer among certain groups. Shawnee, Potawatomi, and other western tribes imported slaves from Ohio and Kentucky and sold or gifted them to allies and Canadian settlers. Mohawk Chief Thayendenaga (Joseph Brant) used black people he had captured during the American Revolution to build Brant House at Burlington Beach and a second home near Brantford. In all, Brant owned about forty black slaves.

Black slaves lived in the British regions of Canada in the 18th century—104 were listed in a 1767 census of Nova Scotia, but their numbers were small until the United Empire Loyalist influx after 1783. As white Loyalists fled the new American Republic, they took with them more than 2,000 black slaves: at least 1,500 to the Maritimes (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island), 300 to Lower Canada (Quebec), and 500 to Upper Canada (Ontario). In Ontario, the Imperial act of Parliament of 1790 assured prospective immigrants that their slaves would remain their property. As under French rule, Loyalist slaves were held in small numbers and were used as domestic servants, farm hands, and skilled artisans.

Following the Battle of the Plains of Abraham and the British conquest of New France, the subject of slavery in Canada is unmentioned—neither banned nor permitted—in both the Treaty of Paris of 1763 and the Quebec Act of 1774 or the Treaty of Paris of 1783.

The system of gang labour, and its consequent institutions of control and brutality, did not develop in Canada as it did in the US. Because they did not appear to pose a threat to their masters, slaves were permitted to learn to read and write, Christian conversion was encouraged, and their marriages were recognized by law. Death rates among slaves were nevertheless high, confirming the brutal nature of the slave regime.

The &quot;Quebec Gazette&quot; of 12 July 1787 had an advertisement:

==Abolition movement==

===Lower Canada (Quebec)===
In Lower Canada, Sir James Monk, the Chief Justice, rendered a series of decisions in the late 1790s that undermined the ability to compel slaves to serve their masters; while &quot;not technically abolishing slavery, [they] rendered it innocuous. The slave could not be 
compelled to serve longer than he would, and ... might leave his master at will.&quot; After declaring from the bench that slavery had &#x27;unsupported in law,&#x27; he thereafter &#x27;systematically dismissed all suits by owners against runaway slaves.&#x27;
Although the legislature was petitioned several times to enact legislation clarifying the property rights of slaveholders and their protection (i.e. imprisonment of slaves), there was insufficient appetite to either abolish slavery outright or enforce slavery. &quot;As Lower Canada passed no legislation on the matter, the extradition of fugitives was made impossible and Canada became therefore an asylum for the oppressed.&quot; As a result, slaves began to flee their masters within the province, but also from other provinces and from the United States. This occurred several years before the legislature acted in Upper Canada to limit slavery. While the decision was founded upon a technicality (the extant law allowing committal of slaves not to jails, but only to houses of correction, of which there were none in the province), Monk went on to say that &quot;slavery did not exist in the province and to warn owners that he would apply this interpretation of the law to all subsequent cases.&quot; In subsequent decisions, and in the absence of specific legislation, Monk&#x27;s interpretation held (even once there had been houses of correction established). In a later test of this interpretation, the administrator of Lower Canada, Sir James Kempt, refused in 1829 a request from the U.S. government to return an escaped slave, informing that fugitives might be given up only when the crime in question was also a crime in Lower Canada: &quot;The state of slavery is not recognized by the Law of Canada. ... Every Slave therefore who comes into the Province is immediately free whether he has been brought in by violence or has entered it of his own accord.&quot;

===Nova Scotia===

While many black people who arrived in Nova Scotia during the American Revolution were free, others were not. Some blacks arrived in Nova Scotia as the property of white American Loyalists. In 1772, prior to the American Revolution, Britain outlawed the slave trade in the British Isles followed by the &quot;Knight v. Wedderburn&quot; decision in Scotland in 1778. This decision, in turn, influenced the colony of Nova Scotia. In 1788, abolitionist James Drummond MacGregor from Pictou published the first anti-slavery literature in Canada and began purchasing slaves&#x27; freedom and chastising his colleagues in the Presbyterian church who owned slaves. Historian Alan Wilson describes the document as &quot;a landmark on the road to personal freedom in province and country&quot;. Historian Robin Winks writes it is &quot;the sharpest attack to come from a Canadian pen even into the 1840s; he had also brought about a public debate which soon reached the courts&quot;. (Abolitionist lawyer Benjamin Kent was buried in Halifax in 1788.) In 1790 John Burbidge freed his slaves. Led by Richard John Uniacke, in 1787, 1789 and again on 11 January 1808 the Nova Scotian legislature refused to legalize slavery. Two chief justices, Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange (1790–1796) and Sampson Salter Blowers (1797–1832), were instrumental in freeing slaves from their owners in Nova Scotia. They were held in high regard in the colony. Justice Alexander Croke (1801–1815) also impounded American slave ships during this time period (the most famous being the Liverpool Packet). During the war, Nova Scotian Sir William Winniett served as a crew on board HMS Tonnant in the effort to free slaves from America. (As the Governor of the Gold Coast, Winniett would later also work to end the slave trade in Western Africa.) By the end of the War of 1812 and the arrival of the Black Refugees, there were few slaves left in Nova Scotia. (The Slave Trade Act 1807 outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 outlawed slavery altogether.)

The Sierra Leone Company was established to relocate groups of formerly enslaved Africans, nearly 1,200 black Nova Scotians, most of whom had escaped enslavement in the United States. Given the coastal environment of Nova Scotia, many had died from the harsh winters. They created a settlement in the existing colony in Sierra Leone (already established to make a home for the &quot;poor blacks&quot; of London) at Freetown in 1792. Many of the &quot;black poor&quot; included other African and Asian inhabitants of London. The Freetown settlement was joined, particularly after 1834, by other groups of freed Africans and became the first African American haven in Africa for formerly enslaved Africans.

===Upper Canada (Ontario)===


By 1790, the abolition movement was gaining credence in Canada and the ill intent of slavery was evidenced by an incident involving a slave woman being violently abused by her slave owner on her way to being sold in the United States. In 1793, Chloe Cooley, in an act of defiance yelled out screams of resistance. The abuse committed by her slave owner and her violent resistance was witnessed by Peter Martin and William Grisely. Peter Martin, a former slave, brought the incident to the attention of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. Under the auspices of Simcoe, the &quot;Act Against Slavery&quot; of 1793 was legislated. The elected members of the executive council, many of whom were merchants or farmers who depended on slave labour, saw no need for emancipation. Attorney-General John White later wrote that there was &quot;much opposition but little argument&quot; to his measure. Finally the Assembly passed the &quot;Act Against Slavery&quot; that legislated the gradual abolition of slavery: no slaves could be imported; slaves already in the province would remain enslaved until death, no new slaves could be brought into Upper Canada, and children born to female slaves would be slaves but must be freed at age 25. To discourage manumission, the Act required the master to provide security that the former slave would not become a public charge. The compromise &quot;Act Against Slavery&quot; stands as the only attempt by any Ontario legislature to act against slavery. This legal rule ensured the eventual end of slavery in Upper Canada, although as it diminished the sale value of slaves within the province it also resulted in slaves being sold to the United States. In 1798 there was an attempt by lobby groups to rectify the legislation and import more slaves. Slaves discovered they could gain freedom by escaping to Ohio and Michigan in the United States.

By 1800, the other provinces of British North America had effectively limited slavery through court decisions requiring the strictest proof of ownership, which was rarely available. In 1819, John Robinson, Attorney General of Upper Canada, issue a legal opinion that all persons of African descent entering Upper Canada should be guaranteed freedom, even if they had been enslaved in another country. Slavery remained legal, however, until the British Parliament&#x27;s Slavery Abolition Act 1833 finally abolished slavery in most parts of the British Empire effective 1 August 1834.

===Underground Railroad===
During the early to mid-19th century, the Underground Railroad network was established in the United States to free slaves, by bringing them to locations where the slaves would be free from being re-captured. British North America, now known as Canada, was a major destination of the Underground Railroad after 1850, with between 30,000 and 100,000 slaves finding refuge.

In Nova Scotia, former slave Richard Preston established the African Abolition Society in the fight to end slavery in America. Preston was trained as a minister in England and met many of the leading voices in the abolitionist movement that helped to get the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 passed by the British Parliament. When Preston returned to Nova Scotia, he became the president of the Abolitionist movement in Halifax.

Preston stated:

There are slave cemeteries in parts of Canada, in various states of condition, some neglected and abandoned. They include cemeteries in St-Armand, Quebec; Shelburne, Nova Scotia; and Priceville and Dresden in Ontario.

==Modern slavery==
The ratifying of the Slavery Convention by Canada in 1953 began the country&#x27;s international commitments to address modern slavery. Human trafficking in Canada is a legal and political issue, and Canadian legislators have been criticized for having failed to deal with the problem in a more systematic way. British Columbia&#x27;s Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons formed in 2007, making British Columbia the first province of Canada to address human trafficking in a formal manner. The biggest human trafficking case in Canadian history surrounded the dismantling of the Domotor-Kolompar criminal organization. On June 6, 2012, the Government of Canada established the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking in order to oppose human trafficking. The Human Trafficking Taskforce was established in June 2012 to replace the Interdepartmental Working Group on Trafficking in Persons as the body responsible for the development of public policy related to human trafficking in Canada.

One current and highly publicized instance is the vast disappearances of Aboriginal women which has been linked to human trafficking by some sources. Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper had been reluctant to tackle the issue on the grounds that it is not a &quot;sociological issue&quot; and declined to create a national inquiry into the issue counter to United Nations and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights&#x27; opinions that the issue is significant and in need of higher inquiry.

In July 2024, a report for the United Nations Human Rights Council by UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery Tomoya Obokata described the temporary foreign worker program as a &quot;breeding ground for contemporary slavery&quot;. Obokata&#x27;s report found many instances of debt bondage, wage theft, lack of personal protective equipment, abuse, and sexual misconduct. Immigration minister Marc Miller gave a statement to &quot;Reuters&quot; saying that the program was &quot;in need of reform&quot; and that the low-wage stream needed to be examined.

<text>Adewale Ayuba (born 6 May 1966), commonly known as Mr. Johnson, is a Nigerian fuji singer. Ayuba has been crowned as the King of Bonsue Fuji due to him being the original artiste who coined the musical genre as a subgenre of Fuji Music. 

== Early life and education ==

Ayuba was born on 6 May, 1966 in Ikenne Remo, Ogun State, Nigeria. At 8 years old, he started singing at local musical competitions and fiestas in Ikenne. This led him to pursue music as a career after finishing his secondary school education at Remo Secondary School, Sagamu, Ogun State.

Although he had gained admission to study Architecture at the Ogun State Polytechnic in Abeokuta, he prioritized his musical career. Ayuba holds a Doctorate of Arts in Music at Bradley University, and a Diploma in Financial Accounting he received at the Queens Borough Community College, New York. 

==Career==
Ayuba released his first album, &quot;Ibere (Beginning)&quot; at the age of 17, the success of which rapidly gained him recognition in the Fuji music scene. In early 1990, Ayuba signed with Sony Music (Nigerian) to record an album, &quot;Bubble&quot;, which was released in 1991 and brought Ayuba into international prominence. &quot;Bubble&quot; marked the first time in history that a Fuji Music album gained such widespread success, topping music charts for six consecutive months and winning multiple awards at the Nigerian Music Awards (NMA). It also won Ayuba the coveted Artist of the Year Awards, including the Album of the Year Award, Song of the Year Award, and Best Fuji Album of the Year Award. With the success of &quot;Bubble&quot;, Ayuba hit the pinnacle of his career in Nigeria.

After the success of &quot;Bubble&quot;, Ayuba released a follow-up album, &quot;Mr. Johnson Play For Me&quot;. In 1993, Ayuba was signed to Premier Music (Nigeria) before starting his first West Africa coast tour, performing in several African countries. It was followed by his first US tour, also in 1993, during which Ayuba performed in over ten states, including the New Orleans Jazz Festival. He was awarded the Key to the City of Providence, Rhode Island by its mayor after two successful concerts there. About his Los Angeles debut, C.C. Smith of Los Angeles Weekly Magazine wrote that &quot;Ayuba bases his Fuji on two elemental forces—rhythm, and the human voice—to create a compelling, enchanting and powerful sound. Expect frenzied dancing style, colorful costumes, exultant fans, and enough talking drums and percussion to remedy even a terminal sensory deprivation.&quot;

After his return in 1993, Ayuba released &quot;Bubble D&quot;, on the Premier Music (Nigeria) label. The album won multiple awards at the Fame Music Awards, topping the music chart for several months. In 1994, Ayuba toured the UK and the US with his band with a vision to &quot;[internationalize] Fuji Music&quot;. He recorded while in America in 1995, and he performed at various international concerts including the 1996 Summer State Concerts in New York, the African Mondo Concerts of 1996 and 1997, the New Orleans Jazz Festival of 1997, the 1997 International Festival in Houston, Texas, and the Black Entertainment Television Jazz USA Concert. Ayuba was signed by US-based Q-disc Record Company for a year contract and released &quot;Fuji Time&quot; on the company&#x27;s label in 1996. In 1997, he released &quot;Fuji Dub&quot; on the Agogo Music Label in London.
In 1998, he went back to Nigeria and released Acceleration on the Corporate Music label. In 2000, he released another album, Turn Me On, which received the Best Fuji Album of the Year at the Awards for Musical Excellence in Nigeria and the Best Song of The Year at the Nigerian Song Festival 2000. In the same year, he toured in many European countries including England, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium. He was awarded as a Distinguished Son of Ikenne Remo during a colorful ceremony at the Ikenne Local Government in Ogun State in 2001, during the same year, Ayuba also performed at the Eko Le Meridien Hotel Banquet Hall in Lagos in a concert titled The Return of Ayuba. This concert was attended by the Executive Governors of Lagos and Ogun state, Federal and State Legislators, and several commissioners, among other dignitaries.

Ayuba and his band also toured Austria in 2001, performing in Graz and Vienna. In 2002, he once again toured countries in Europe for four months, performing in England, France, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands. While on this tour, Ayuba recorded another album, &quot;Formula&quot;, which in 2002 was awarded as the Best Fuji Album of the Year at the Awards for Musical Excellence in Nigeria. In 2002, the Music Advertisers Association of Nigeria named Ayuba the Best Artiste of the Millennium. In 2003, Ayuba again toured European Cities, performing in Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin, Essen, Krefeld, Paris, Antwerp, Amsterdam, Bologna, Naples, Turin, and Genoa. While on this tour, he recorded a joint album, &quot;Fuji Satisfaction&quot;, with German-based Afro-centric Music group Bantu, which won two Awards, The Best Group in West Africa and The Best Group in Africa at the Kora Music Awards in Durban, South Africa.

Ayuba was awarded the Millennium Voice of Nigerian Music (home and abroad) in Düsseldorf, Germany by Pan-Yoruba group Omo Oduduwa Association in recognition of his valuable contributions to the growth of the music industry.

In 2004, Ayuba released &quot;Ijo Fuji&quot; (Fuji Dance) in Nigeria, and was also given the Entertainer of the Year Award by the Nigerian American Community Association in the same year. &quot;Ijo Fuji&quot; won the Best Fuji Album of the Year Award at the Awards for Musical Excellence in Nigeria in July 2005. The Ikenne Development Association in Chicago gave him its Ogo-irawo award in recognition of his contribution to the development of Ikenne Remo (2004) . Ayuba&#x27;s album, &quot;Mellow&quot;, which became a success after release, won the Best Fuji Vocal Performance at the (AMEN) 2007 Awards, which topped Nigeria&#x27;s contemporary African charts.

==Music career==

Ayuba began his musical journey at a young age, influenced by his father, an amateur singer who emphasized the importance of education. His father allowed him to focus on his studies during the week, reserving Saturdays for music practice. Ayuba signed his first record deal in the 1980s, and has since released 15 albums in Nigeria and four internationally.
==Awards and honors==
Ayuba won two Kora Awards in 2005.

Ayuba is a member of the Nigerian Red Cross and was dubbed &quot;Prince Of Peace&quot; in 2012.

==Family==
Adewale Ayuba is the youngest child in his family. He is married to Azukaego Kwentoh, with whom he has seven children. &quot;(Only child that is disclosed by Adewale Ayuba is Tiwalade Jetawo, specific information from his family is unknown and has not been disclosed as of now)&quot;

The couple met at a cafeteria at Queens Borough Community College in the United States, where Ayuba was studying, and married in 1989. Kwentoh hails from Onitsha-Oke in Anambra State, southeastern Nigeria.

Ayuba was born to a Christian mother. However, in order to gain acceptance for his music genre, Bonsue Fuji, which was more widely embraced by Yoruba Muslims, Ayuba converted to Islam. His conversion was marked by a formal ceremony on 1 December 1990, during which he was given the honorary title of Osupa Adini of Itire Land, Surulere, Lagos, Nigeria.

In 2010, Ayuba reverted to Christianity. This change in faith was publicly confirmed by Ayuba during a testimony at the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), City of David, in January 2015. 

==Filmography==
Ayuba acted as a journalist in the movie &quot;Mystery of Unity&quot;, which was produced by Ebun Oloyede.

==Artistry==
Ayuba is the primary songwriter and collaborates closely with his fifteen-member ensemble, &quot;Ayuba and the Bonsue Fuji Band&quot;, where he serves as the lead vocalist. Throughout his career, Ayuba has worked closely with his band, which has played an integral role in his musical success. His distinctive sound blends traditional Yoruba talking drums with elements of American percussion. Ayuba aims to take Fuji music to the whole world, just as Bob Marley had taken reggae to the whole world.

==Other ventures==
In 2013, Ayuba enlisted his long-time stylist and fashion designer to launch &quot;Bonsue Wears&quot;, a fashion line that helped increase global recognition of his unique style. Ayuba has long had an affinity for traditional Yoruba attire, particularly the &quot;shokoto&quot; and &quot;bubba&quot; ensemble. Comfortable performing in these garments, they have come to define his signature on-stage look. The &quot;Bonsue Wears&quot; collection features a two-piece design, consisting of a shirt-like top with wide, open sleeves and matching pants that gather at the knees. The line merges traditional Yoruba fashion with contemporary urban influences.

Ayuba supports his music trade as a businessman, using the Diploma in Financial Accounting he received at the Queens Borough Community College, New York.

<text>General Sir Samuel James Browne, (3 October 1824 – 14 March 1901) was a British Indian Army cavalry officer, known best as the creator of the Sam Browne belt. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the most prestigious award for gallantry in combat that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==
He was born in Barrackpore, India, the son of Dr. John Browne, a surgeon of the Bengal Medical Service and his wife Charlotte (née Swinton). Educated in England, Browne returned to India in 1840 and joined the 46th Bengal Native Infantry as an ensign. During the Second Anglo-Sikh War, he participated in actions at Ramnuggar, Sadulpur, Chillianwalla and Gujrat. In 1849 he was made a lieutenant and tasked with raising a cavalry force, to be designated the 2nd Punjab Irregular Cavalry and later incorporated into the regular force. From 1851 to 1863 he was adjutant and then commanding officer of this unit. Later (1904) the unit would be re-designated as the 22nd Sam Browne&#x27;s Cavalry (Frontier Force) in his honour.

== Indian Mutiny ==
Browne commanded the 2nd Punjab in several engagements, and was decorated for action during the Bozdar Expedition of 1857, being promoted to captain.

Browne was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions on 31 August 1858 at Seerporah, Rohilkhand, Uttar Pradesh, India. His citation reads:
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum.

== Sam Browne belt ==

Sometime after this incident he began to wear the accoutrement which now bears his name, as compensation for the difficulty his disability caused with wearing his officer&#x27;s sword. A Sam Browne belt is a wide belt, usually leather, supported by a narrower strap passing diagonally over the right shoulder; the diagonal strap stabilizes the scabbard of a sword if worn. Later such a belt would be adopted by other officers who knew Browne in India, but it was not to become used commonly by the British Army until after his retirement. Browne&#x27;s original &quot;Sam Browne&quot; belt is possessed presently by the National Army Museum in Chelsea.

== Later career and retirement ==
After the Indian Mutiny, Browne remained in the Indian Army and was promoted major-general in February 1870. In 1876 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI), and became a lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877.

During the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1878–9, Browne commanded the Peshawar Valley Field Force. After entering Afghanistan via the Khyber Pass, and defeating the Afghan army at the battle of Ali Masjid on 21 November 1878, he occupied Jalalabad on 20 December. However, further advance towards Kabul in the new year was slowed by transport difficulties. After the end of the first phase of the war in May 1879, Browne&#x27;s force returned to India. Although criticised by the viceroy Lord Lytton for the slow pace of his advance, Browne was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) and received the thanks of both Parliament and the government of India for his Afghan service. He retired from active service in 1884, was promoted general on 1 December 1888 and made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in 1891.

In retirement Browne lived in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, England, and died there in 1901 at the age of 76. His remains were cremated but there is a memorial marker dedicated to Browne in the Ryde New Cemetery, as well as plaques at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London and Lahore Cathedral in Pakistan. His grave was restored in 2010.

<text>The Sam Browne belt is a leather belt with a supporting strap that passes over the right shoulder, worn by military and police officers. It is named after Sir Samuel J. Browne (1824–1901), the British Indian Army general who invented it.

==Origins==
General Sir Samuel James Browne was a 19th-century British Indian Army officer who lost his left arm to a sword cut during the Sepoy Rebellion; the lack of a left hand to steady his scabbard made it difficult for him to draw his sword.

Browne devised a supplementary belt that hooked into a waist belt with D-rings and went over his right shoulder to steady the scabbard. The waist belt also securely carried a pistol in a flap-holster on his right hip and included a binocular case with a neck-strap. Other officers began wearing a similar rig and eventually it became part of the standard uniform. During the Boer War, it was copied by other troops and eventually became standard issue.

Infantry officers wore a variant that used two suspender-like straps instead of the cross-belt. It was supposedly invented in 1878 by Lieutenant Basil Templer Graham-Montgomery, of the 60th King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, while serving in India.

==Use==
===Military===
Due to its former use as equipment for carrying a sword, it was traditionally only worn by those to whom a sword would historically have been issued, namely commissioned officers and warrant officers.

====Finland====
In the Finnish Army (as well as in Finnish Air Force) the Sam Browne belt, officially known as a &quot;command belt&quot; or &quot;officer belt&quot;, has been used by officers and senior NCOs as well as officer cadets when wearing service, dress or parade uniforms. Currently it is mainly used by high-ranking officers during parades and other ceremonies, as it is only worn with dress uniform M58 and service uniform M83; while most Army and Air Force personnel, excluding cadets studying in the National Defence College as well as soldiers on ceremonial duties, use the camouflage uniform M05 as their service uniform, and the use of the &quot;command belt&quot; with any camouflage uniform except M62 (already phased out of service) is strictly forbidden.

====Germany====
The Sam Browne belt featured prominently in many uniforms used by the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany, again in imitation of earlier European uniforms. It was popular with Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazi officials.

==== Greece ====

The Sam Browne belt was used concurrently with British-style uniforms from 1937 till 1970 by the Hellenic Army and the Hellenic Gendarmerie.

====Ireland====
The Irish Citizen Army, Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Army (IRA) made extensive use of Sam Browne belts during the Irish revolutionary period (1916–23). This included women serving with the Irish Citizen Army, among them Constance Markievicz. The folk song &quot;The Broad Black Brimmer&quot; also mentions the Sam Browne belt. They were later used by the Garda Síochána and the National Army.

====Sweden====
The Swedish Armed Forces used Sam Browne belts as part of their uniform for officers and NCOs from 1923 until 1958.

====United Kingdom and the Commonwealth====

In the 20th century it was a mainstay in the British Army officer corps, being adopted service-wide in 1900 during the Second Boer War after limited use in India and later becoming popular with military forces throughout the Commonwealth.

After World War II the Sam Browne belt saw a decline in use in the Commonwealth. It was dropped from the standard officer&#x27;s field kit in 1943 and replaced by the cloth 1937 pattern and 1944 pattern webbing gear. However officers and warrant officers class I of the British Army and Royal Marines still wear it in service (No. 2) dress and in non-ceremonial versions of No. 1 dress.

It was phased out by the Canadian military beginning with the unification of the armed services in 1968.

In Australia all officers and warrant officers class I are entitled to wear the belt in ceremonial dress. Within the corps of the Australian Army there is some variation, with members of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps and Australian Army Aviation Corps wearing black Sam Browne belts.

In the Indian Army the Sam Browne belt was worn by officers and Junior Commissioned Officers until the early 1980s, after which its use was phased out. However it is still part of the uniform of officers in the Indian police forces.

==== United States ====

During World War I, the Sam Browne Belt was approved by General Pershing, commander of the AEF, for wear by American officers as a rank distinction. However, the Army as a whole did not immediately approve its use. MPs were positioned at stateside docks and confiscated them from returning officers. The United States Army mandated the Sam Browne belt for overseas soldiers in 1918 under the name &quot;Liberty belt&quot; and for all service members in 1921, this time under the internationally accepted name &quot;Sam Browne belt&quot;. It was a standard part of the uniform between World War I and World War II. It was limited in use in 1940 when the Army abandoned sabers and replaced with a cloth waistbelt that was sewn to the officer&#x27;s jacket.

During World War I the Marine Corps adopted a brown leather Sam Browne Belt. It was later changed to black, the official color of Navy and Marine Corps leather gear. It is worn as part of the dress Blue A &amp; B, Blue-white dress, and service A uniform by sword-bearing commissioned and warrant officers.

After the First World War, Sam Browne belts &quot;become almost universal among American police&quot;. The belts led to the slang terms &quot;Harness Bull&quot; or &quot;Harness Cop&quot; for a uniformed police officer. The utility belts worn today by American police usually lack the cross-strap and the attachments for them. The belt fastens in the same way, with the bar of the buckle engaging a pair of hooks and the end of the belt retained by a post and keeper loop. They are also frequently fully lined, as opposed to the old-style half-linings, to support equipment the length of the belt.

===Police===
The Sam Browne belt is largely obsolete (except in dress uniforms) in police and security use due to risk of strangulation by potential opponents. It has sometimes been referred to as a &quot;Suicide Belt&quot; by personnel. It had enjoyed some popularity with civilian police agencies worldwide and was probably most widely worn in this context during the 1940s and 1950s. This use has gradually faded out due to field safety concerns.

Despite these safety concerns New Jersey State Police Troopers always wear their sidearm on a full Sam Browne belt. The full Sam Browne belt was adopted by for New Jersey State Police use by New Jersey State Police Col. Norman Schwarzkopf Sr., as the belt gave the wearer a proper &quot;brace&quot; (known by General of the Armies John Pershing as the &quot;West Point Brace)&quot;.

It is part of the ceremonial dress uniform of many agencies, most notably the Red Serge worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. RCMP NCOs and other ranks wear a thin cross-belt over the left shoulder to support the pistol worn on the right side. Non-commissioned members who are left-handed wear the same cross strap over the right shoulder to support the pistol worn on the left side. RCMP commissioned officers wear a wider cross strap over the right shoulder due to the need to support a sword when wearing the red serge ceremonial uniform. This difference of wearing different cross straps over different shoulders for commissioned and non-commissioned members is maintained when wearing the stripped Sam Browne belt (no pistol or sword).

===Civilian===
During the interwar period, the belt became fashionable among some American and European women. Eleanor Roosevelt, the first lady of the United States at the time, openly spoke out against the practice. In the United States, the belts also became a symbol of civilian authority by &quot;everybody from bus drivers to volunteer schoolboy traffic cops&quot;. The belt&#x27;s use by American junior safety patrol members is archetypal. High visibility, Sam Browne-style belts are a popular safety device among cyclists for increasing their visibility, and a bright orange version is often worn by school crossing guards in junior safety patrols. The Sam Browne belt has been proposed as a solution to occupational safety and health concerns about injury due to the weight of equipment on police officers&#x27; belts. However, others have expressed concern that the vertical design of the belt could enable others to gain physical control of law enforcement officers in an altercation.

<doc id="397092" wikidata="Q1408823" url="?curid=397092" title="Sovereign Council of New France">
<text>The Sovereign Council of New France (, ), or simply Sovereign Council (), was a governing body in New France. It served as both Supreme Court for the colony of New France, as well as a policy-making body, though this latter role diminished over time. The council, though officially established in 1663 by King Louis XIV of France, was not created from whole cloth, but rather evolved from earlier governing bodies. As early as 1647, a council of three was created by the King. In 1648, this council was enlarged to include five members. The Sovereign Council came to be known as the Superior Council (&quot;Conseil Supérieur&quot;) as early as June 16, 1703, when Louis XIV issued a royal edict referring to it as the Superior Council instead of its former name, and increasing the number of sitting Councilors from seven to twelve.

The institution lasted from its introduction in 1663 to the fall of New France in 1760. Its last meeting occurred on April 28, 1760, the day of the Battle of Sainte-Foy.

==Creation of the Council==

In April 1662, Louis XIV issued an edict creating a new governing council named the &quot;Sovereign Council.&quot; The new Sovereign Council had a broad policy mandate. The edict creating the Council authorized it to spend public funds, regulate the fur trade, regulate trade between colonists and French merchants, and issue police measures. The council was also to create a system of lower courts in Québec, Montréal, and Trois-Rivières, and was to appoint judges, bailiffs and other court officials. The Sovereign Council possessed a larger membership than previous colonial councils, having nine members in 1663. These nine members were the governor general, the bishop (or, in his absence, the senior ecclesiastic), five councilors, an attorney general, and a clerk.

The creation of the Sovereign Council was part of a broader effort to reform the administration of New France by Louis XIV and his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert. The King and Colbert felt that New France&#x27;s administration had been badly mismanaged by charter companies and that the colony should be brought under tighter monarchal control. There was also a concern in the colony over the growing power of the Governor, especially in regard to the Church. In 1663, the colony was made an official province of the Kingdom of France. The crown&#x27;s contract with the Company of One Hundred Associates, the main charter company in New France, was cancelled, and a new Charter company called the French West India Company was created.

==The Council and the Intendant==

Around this time, the office of Intendant of New France was also established. The intendant was to be in charge of police, justice, and finance in the colony. Shortly after the post&#x27;s creation in 1665, the intendant began to sit on the Sovereign Council, though its place on the council was not made official until 1675. Over time, the intendant became more powerful, and some of the former responsibilities of the council were shifted to the intendant, with the power to appoint lower court officials being granted to the position in 1680.

==Functions and achievements==

One of the Sovereign Council&#x27;s greatest achievements was its efficacy in processing civil suits. Contemporary evidence suggests that from the day defendants were summoned to court, they had one or two weeks to appear with their summons, at which time a verdict was definitively reached. More than just a judicial body, however, the Sovereign Council made lasting achievements in agriculture, commerce, the maintenance of public order, and sanitation. Many of these achievements were in the first century of the Sovereign Council&#x27;s existence, prior to the dissolution of some of its responsibilities to the increasingly centralized intendant and other offices.
The Sovereign Council exercised considerable authority over New France&#x27;s economic affairs. It dictated when certain types of commercial interactions could occur, and public markets in Québec City, Montréal and Trois Rivières were only established under the Sovereign Council&#x27;s auspices. It was also the primary regulatory body for coinage, regulating colonial weights, measures and scales until paper currency surpassed metal currency in 1685. The Sovereign Council was very involved in early attempts to stimulate economic activity and maximize agricultural productivity. Ordinances mandated that seigneurs clear their seigneurs within an allotted time, and exempted small crops from yearly tithes for the first five years of cultivation. The Council sometimes directly intervened on behalf of the peasantry, the foundation of the colony. In 1680, it decreed that one-twentieth of uncleared land be made available to peasants. In an effort to protect the peasant&#x27;s most valuable commodity, the cow, a 1686 ordinance enforced Louis XIV&#x27;s edict that creditors could not seize cattle for debts until the year 1692. Similarly, after complaints were made that merchant monopolies were storing surpluses of wheat and preventing its circulation on the market in 1701, the Sovereign Council ordered a committee to inspect Quebec&#x27;s granaries. The committee found that merchant monopolies were unfairly keeping surpluses, and the Sovereign Council consequently ordered that the surplus be seized and sold to the poor at a subsidized rate.

While the Council had to execute the King&#x27;s administrative policies, it was often able to act independently given the geographic expanse of New France and its distance from metropolitan France. For example, the Sovereign Council allowed seigneurs to extract undue feudal tithes from peasants, which ran contrary to the &quot;Coutume de Paris&quot; until Louis XIV intervened and abolished the practice in 1717. The Sovereign Council undertook other policies aimed at the maintenance of public order with mixed success. A 1663 ordinance mandated the collection of extra food and clothing to distribute amongst the poor as part of an effort to mitigate social unrest. A 1668 edict established commissions distinguishing between the deserving poor and the undeserving poor. This notion that the deserving poor were worthy of local, parish-administered aid while the undeserving poor were destitute law-breakers was common in metropolitan France and Western Europe at the time. Reflecting colonial society&#x27;s emphasis on righteousness and morality, the Sovereign Council mandated that every tavern-keeper provide sufficient proof of his virtuous character in order to obtain a business licence.

Attempts to improve public infrastructure were met with limited success. Early ventures in constructing roads proved especially futile given the necessity and the prevalence of rivers as a means of transportation. A 1664 ordinance that mandated inhabitants in the Grande Allée leave part of their land along the riverbed unsown was largely ignored for example. Peasants needed river access for their personal drinking water, crops, animals, and transportation. The Sovereign Council ordered the creation of the first highway linking Quebec to the countryside in 1667. In 1696, it delegated these responsibilities to the senior road surveyor, le grand voyer, with local captains of the militia in charge of overseeing the quality of the roads in each seigneurie. The Council exhibited some degree of commitment to sanitation and waste management, paving central town streets to minimize weather damage and accumulation of waste. One of its greater successes was actually enforcing an ordinance mandating that inhabitants in Quebec&#x27;s Lower Town clear the area in front of their homes, until a seasonal worker with a horse and cart was eventually introduced. The Sovereign Council&#x27;s only ordinance mandating wells be drilled in Upper and Lower Canada in 1687 was never realized. Cahall notes that drilling wells was likely not a priority because no epidemics arose as a result of inhabitants drinking contaminated water under the entirety of the Sovereign Council&#x27;s administration from 1663 to 1760. Moreover, townspeople drank river water for the entirety of French colonial rule without much concern.

==The Sovereign Council as a Superior Court==

The Sovereign Council acted as the court of appeal for decisions made in the lower courts in New France. Any criminal conviction could be appealed to the Council. There was some hope in a more favourable outcome, as the attorney general who sat on the Council was the only official in New France required having formal university legal training.

The Sovereign Council could also amend verdicts without overturning convictions. In 1734, an African slave burned her owner&#x27;s home in protest. The local magistrate ordered the accused to be burned alive, but the Council intervened and commuted the punishment to death by hanging.

The crimes prosecuted by the colonial judicial system, the bishop, and, by extension, the Sovereign Council, were diverse, although extra weight was given to crimes that undermined France&#x27;s colonial interests. An increasing problem was acts against the crown including forgery, where subjects created counterfeit money by modifying their playing cards (also a source of money at the time), and this comprised approximately 17% of all cases in the 18th century. Also rising as a proportion of all crimes over the 18th century were violent crimes like assault, which constituted approximately 1/3rd of all cases.

Concentration of prosecuted crimes was mainly around urban settings, notwithstanding the fact that towns represented only an average of 20% of New France&#x27;s population. A large majority of the trials were held in Montreal, indicating a higher rate of crime further away from the seat of government and closer to the frontier. Approximately a third of the punishments mandated for the various crimes were fines, and a fifth executions.

==Conflict and the regulation of alcohol==

A challenge that influenced the development of the Sovereign Council was the regulation of alcohol traded with Natives. Bishop François de Laval had called for an outright prohibition on the sale of alcohol to Indigenous Peoples in the early 1660s, and conflict between the Church and Jesuits on one hand and the Governor on the other is argued to have contributed to the establishment of the Council. The Council eventually agreed with the Bishop&#x27;s demands, but with a fine as opposed to a harsher punishment for conviction initially, but the issue would remain open.
Prohibition of alcohol transactions to Aboriginals was an important cause to the Church, who was fearful of Native drunkenness. However, the majority of the Council was not willing to prosecute violators to the full extent of the legislation.
Led by intendant Jean Talon, the Council then legalized the trade – not for moral reasons, but to increase profits of colonial subjects. An interim period followed where the Sovereign Council refused to mete out any sentences for the crimes, but the Church would excommunicate suspected traders. The activity did regain its illicit status, but the number of cases of the activity that made prosecution was trending downwards significantly throughout the later 18th century. Traffic of alcohol to Natives was only a minor crime by the mid-18th century.

==Composition==

The Sovereign Council included nine officials who were fully responsible for all legislative, executive, and judicial matters. It made rules and enacted laws concerning the day-to-day affairs of the colony

*The Governor General of New France was the direct representative of the king of France and was responsible for defense and diplomatic relations.
*The Apostolic Vicar for New France (after 1674, Bishop of New France) was in control of religious affairs, which included charity, education, hospitals and the Christianization of Amerindians. 
*The Intendant of New France was responsible for economic affairs and trade, the administration of justice, finance, settlement and seigneurialism. He traveled from house to house asking what should be improved.
*The Captain of the Militia informed the inhabitants of the Intendant&#x27;s plans for the development for the colony, reported on the concerns of the people, and tallied the census. As New France became better organized, further captains were added in each province to fulfill the duties of the Council.
*Five councillors served as a Court of Appeal and as a governing body, and they formed the colony&#x27;s senior court of law. In 1703, the number of councillors was increased to twelve. Prior to 1675, the councillors were appointed by the Governor General and thereafter by the King alone. Amongst these councillors were included the offices of Procurator General and Registrar of New France.

<doc id="397093" wikidata="Q3110254" url="?curid=397093" title="Kapolei, Hawaii">
<text>Kapolei () is a planned community in the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, United States, on the island of Oʻahu. In 1977, the government designated it as the &quot;second city&quot; of Oʻahu, in relation to Honolulu. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Kapolei as a census-designated place (CDP) within the consolidated city-county of Honolulu.

The community takes its name from a volcanic cone, &quot;Puʻu o Kapolei&quot;. In the Hawaiian language, &quot;puʻu&quot; means &quot;hill&quot; and &quot;Kapo lei&quot; means &quot;beloved Kapo&quot;. According to legend, Kapo, Goddess of Fertility was sister to Pele, Goddess of Fire and Nāmaka, Goddess of the Sea.

Much of the land is part of the estate of industrialist James Campbell. Kapolei&#x27;s major developer is Kapolei Property Development, a subsidiary of James Campbell Company. Kapolei sits primarily upon former sugarcane and pineapple fields.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, there were 21,411 people, 6,583 housing units, and 6,822 families in the CDP. Kapolei in 2020 had a population density of 4,900.7 inhabitants per square mile. The racial makeup was 14.0% White (2,358 people), 2.5% African American (560), 0.0% Native American (40), 29.7% Asian (7,432), 15.8% Pacific Islander (3,052), and 37.2% from two or more races (7,623). A total of 12.9% (2,675) of the population had Hispanic or Latino origin.

The ancestry was 6.8% German, 4.1% Irish, 2.1% English, 2.0% Portuguese, 1.4% Italian, 1.3% French, 1.3% Sub-Saharan African, 1.0% Polish, 0.5% Norwegian, 0.4% West Indian, and 0.3% Scottish.

The median age was 32.7 years old. A total of 30.6% of the population were under 18, with 7.7% under 5. A total of 9.2% of the population were 65 or older, with 5.0% between the ages of 65 and 74, 3.2% between the ages of 75 and 84, and 0.9% 85 or older. The gender makeup was 50.5% female and 49.5% male.

The median household income was $116,128, with families having $121,606, married couples having $128,844, and non-families having $73,524. A total of 6.1% of the population were in poverty, with 8.9% of those under 18, 4.8% between the ages of 18 and 64, and 5.6% of people 65 or older being in poverty. The per capita income was $41,203.

==History==
 In 1955 the Kapolei master plan was drafted and revised 3 different times beginning in 1974. In 1977 the new General Provision Plan adopted the Oʻahu General Plan which dubbed Kapolei &quot;second urban center&quot; (SUC) on the island of Oʻahu. In 1986 the ʻEwa Master Plan was revised to include the SUC and the initial residential construction in the Kapolei area began in the late 1980s with commercial developments springing up shortly thereafter. Nearly two decades later, in 2006 the Kapolei area had more than 800 companies, agencies, and organizations making up approximately 25,000 jobs. As of the 2010 census, the Kapolei CDP had a population of 15,186 people.

The original development objectives for the City of Kapolei were to include: an employment center, a new center for offices and businesses, a center for government offices, a city of people walking, biking, or bussing, the latest energy-efficient technologies such as water conservation and recycling, and the most efficient connectivity for commuting on Oʻahu. In essence a &quot;smart city&quot;. The design plan for development ensures that the 7 themes of Kapolei remain the same throughout its construction. These include 1. Hawaiian Garden City 2. Healthy Living 3. Complete Community Services 4. Pedestrian-friendly 5. Past/Present/Future design architecture 6. Sustainability 7. Technology.

Kapolei is quickly becoming the second urban center of Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi&#x27;s most densely populated island. Much of Oʻahu&#x27;s future population growth is projected for the Kapolei area, ʻEwa Plain, and southern slopes of the island&#x27;s central valley, between Waipahu near Pearl Harbor and Wahiawā near the island&#x27;s center.

The U.S. postal code for Kapolei is 96707. In 2002, &quot;Pacific Business News&quot; reported that 96707 had the second highest median income on the island of Oʻahu, at $62,303. &quot;Sperlings&#x27;s Best Places&quot; reports Kapolei&#x27;s median income of $70,129, compared to the national average of $42,350. Nearly one household in five has income exceeding $100,000, with a home ownership rate of 70%.

== Communities ==
Other communities in the Kapolei area are the census-designated places of Makakilo and Naval Air Station Barbers Point (now known as Kalaeloa), the industrial area known as Campbell Industrial Park with the state&#x27;s second largest deepwater port, Barbers Point Harbor, and the resort and marina community of Ko Olina, which includes the Disney Aulani Resort and Ko Olina Golf Club.

==Transportation==
Ongoing road construction has not resolved continuing traffic problems. A Manawai Street-Kama‘aha Avenue extension was completed in August 2006 and helped to reduce congestion along Kamokila Boulevard and Farrington Highway. Kapolei Property Development began construction in January 2007 on a $2 million road to extend Kamokila Boulevard from Kapolei Parkway to Roosevelt Avenue. Kapolei Property Development recently contributed $6 million for a joint project with the State Department of Transportation for an additional freeway on-ramp.

Although state and county governments and some of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s largest companies have significant workplaces in Kapolei, population growth has far out-paced local job creation. A majority of Kapolei adults work in Honolulu, congesting the main traffic artery, Interstate H-1. In December 2006, the Honolulu City Council approved the Honolulu Rail Transit Project (now known as Skyline), a fixed-guideway elevated rail system connecting Kapolei to Downtown Honolulu. In January 2007, Oʻahu residents saw an increase of 0.5 percent to the general excise tax to help cover the system&#x27;s construction costs. The project broke ground in East Kapolei on February 22, 2011. Work on the foundations for the concrete pillars began shortly after in Waipahu; work to install the pillars started in East Kapolei in April 2012, and the first phase of the project started service to Aloha Stadium on June 30, 2023.

=== Main roads===
Kapolei is located at the southern end of the slopes of the Waiʻanae mountain near the neighborhood of Makakilo with Fort Barrette Road, located along and named for historically important Fort Barrette, connecting Makakilo to Kapolei. It is located on the ʻEwa Plain approximately from Honolulu. The Interstate H-1 freeway divides more recently developed Kapolei from Makakilo, and traveling eastward on H-1 connects to Waipahu. In the other direction, the freeway ends about west of Kapolei, merging into Farrington Highway (State Route 93) to Kahe and then to Nānākuli on the Wai‘anae Coast. Traveling eastward on Farrington Highway connects to Honouliuli. Exit 1 on H-1 is Kalaeloa Boulevard, the entrance to Barbers Point and Campbell Industrial Park. Less than 1 mile beyond (west of) the merge of H-1 and Farrington Highway is an off-ramp and overcrossing to the West Oʻahu resort area of Ko Olina.

To the south, Renton Road connects Kapolei to Kalaeloa and, further east, to ʻEwa Villages.

==Economy==

Ka Makana Ali‘i, a mall that opened in October 2016, has 1.4 million square feet of retail space and more than a hundred stores. Macy&#x27;s Department Store is an anchor for the mall.

==Government and infrastructure==
Kapolei is officially governed by the government of Honolulu County. The county government covers the entire island of Oʻahu, with the county seat being at Honolulu Hale in Honolulu. The governmental body includes the Mayor of Honolulu County, the Honolulu City and County Council, and state representatives.

Kapolei Hale, built in 2001, serves as the civic center and main municipal building of the City of Kapolei. The building contains an office for the Mayor, as well as offices of various city and county government agencies and is the headquarters for the City and County of Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation. However, the Permits Office for the Department of Parks and Recreation is located downtown Honolulu at the Frank F. Fasi Civic Center in the Frank F. Fasi Municipal Building at 650 South King Street.

Additionally, federal, several state, and county department offices have been relocated to the Kapolei area. In 2010 the Hawaiʻi State Judiciary Court relocated family court matters from cramped offices in downtown Honolulu to a newly constructed, technologically advanced building in Kapolei.

The Honolulu Police Department operates the Kapolei Regional Police Station for district 8 at 1100 Kamokila Boulevard.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Honolulu field office is in Kapolei at 91-1300 Enterprise Street. Opened in 2013, it is the first federal agency to be headquartered in Kapolei. This Honolulu field office has jurisdiction over Hawaiʻi, Guam, Saipan, and American Samoa with resident agencies in Maui, Kona, Guam, and Saipan. The previous site in downtown Honolulu was too small.

A coal power plant operated until 2022. A 585 MWh lithium iron phosphate battery opened in 2024.

==Education==
The Hawaiʻi Department of Education operates public schools in Hawaiʻi, including Kapolei. Public elementary schools in the Kapolei CDP include Kapolei Elementary School and Hoʻokele Elementary School, with one public middle school, Kapolei Middle School, and one public high school, Kapolei High School.

Island Pacific Academy (pre-K through 12) in Kapolei CDP, which opened as a private school in 2004, is an International Baccalaureate (IB) school offering IB classes to all grades. American Renaissance Academy (pre-K through 12) opened as a private school in 2007 in Kalaeloa, Naval Air Station Barbers Point.

Barbers Point Elementary School is in Kalaeloa CDP (formerly Barbers Point Housing CDP) but has a Kapolei address. Makakilo Elementary School and Mauka Lani Elementary School are in Makakilo CDP but have Kapolei addresses.

The University of Hawaiʻi – West Oʻahu relocated to Kapolei and opened its new campus in August 2012 at 91-1001 Farrington Highway. Hawaii Tokai International College relocated to Kapolei in April 2015. Wayland Baptist University is also located in Kapolei.

<text>Barry James Marshall (born 30 September 1951) is an Australian physician, Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, Professor of Clinical Microbiology and Co-Director of the Marshall Centre at the University of Western Australia. Marshall and Robin Warren showed that the bacterium &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; (&quot;H. pylori&quot;) plays a major role in causing many peptic ulcers, challenging decades of medical doctrine holding that ulcers were caused primarily by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid. This discovery has allowed for a breakthrough in understanding a causative link between &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection and stomach cancer.

==Early life and education==
Marshall was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia and lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of eight. His father held various jobs, and his mother was a nurse. He is the eldest of four siblings. He attended Marist College, Churchlands for his secondary education and the University of Western Australia School of Medicine, where he received a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 1974. He married his wife Adrienne in 1972 and has four children, a son and three daughters.

==Career and research==
In 1979, Marshall was appointed Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital. He met Dr. Robin Warren, a pathologist interested in gastritis, during internal medicine fellowship training at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together, they both studied the presence of spiral bacteria in association with gastritis. In 1982, they performed the initial culture of &quot;H. pylori&quot; and developed their hypothesis on the bacterial cause of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. It has been claimed that the &quot;H. pylori&quot; theory was ridiculed by established scientists and doctors, who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach. Marshall was quoted as saying in 1998 that &quot;everyone was against me, but I knew I was right.&quot; On the other hand, it has also been argued that medical researchers showed a proper degree of scientific scepticism until the &quot;H. pylori&quot; hypothesis could be supported by evidence.

In 1982 Marshall and Warren obtained funding for one year of research. The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after two days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures unusable after two days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the following Monday. In that sample, they discovered the presence of &quot;H. pylori&quot;. They later found out that &quot;H. pylori&quot; grows more slowly than the conventional two days required by other mucosal bacteria, and that stomach cultures were not contaminated by other organisms.

In 1983 they submitted their findings thus far to the Gastroenterological Society of Australia, but the reviewers turned their paper down, rating it in the bottom 10% of those they received that year.

After failed attempts to infect piglets in 1984, Marshall, after having a baseline endoscopy done, drank a broth containing cultured &quot;H. pylori&quot;, expecting to develop, perhaps years later, an ulcer. He was surprised when, only three days later, he developed vague nausea and halitosis, due to the achlorhydria. There was no acid to kill bacteria in the stomach and their waste products manifested as bad breath, noticed by his wife. On days 5–8, he developed achlorhydric (no acid) vomiting. On day eight, he had a repeat endoscopy, which showed massive inflammation (gastritis), and a biopsy from which &quot;H. pylori&quot; was cultured, showing it had colonised his stomach. On the fourteenth day after ingestion, a third endoscopy was done, and Marshall began to take antibiotics. Marshall did not develop antibodies to &quot;H. pylori&quot;, suggesting that innate immunity can sometimes eradicate acute &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection. Marshall&#x27;s illness and recovery, based on a culture of organisms extracted from a patient, fulfilled Koch&#x27;s postulates for &quot;H. pylori&quot; and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcers. This experiment was published in 1985 in the &quot;Medical Journal of Australia&quot; and is among the most cited articles from the journal.

After his work at Fremantle Hospital, Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985–86) and at the University of Virginia, USA (1986–present), before returning to Australia while remaining on the faculty of the University of Virginia. He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia (UWA) from 1998 to 2003. Marshall continues research related to &quot;H. pylori&quot; and runs the &quot;H. pylori&quot; Research Laboratory at UWA.

In 2007, Marshall was appointed Co-Director of The Marshall Centre for Infectious Diseases Research and Training, founded in his honour. In addition to &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; research, the Centre conducted varied research into infectious disease identification and surveillance, diagnostics and drug design, and transformative discovery. His research group expanded to embrace new technologies, including Next-Generation Sequencing and genomic analysis. Marshall also accepted a part-time appointment at the Pennsylvania State University that same year. He established the Noisy Guts Project in 2017 – a research team dedicated to investigating new diagnostics and treatments for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This resulted in a spin-out company Noisy Guts Pty Ltd which develops functional food products. In August 2020, Marshall, along with Simon J. Thorpe, accepted a position at the scientific advisory board of Brainchip INC, a computer chip company.

==Awards and honours==
In 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Marshall and Robin Warren, his long-time collaborator, &quot;for their discovery of the bacterium &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease&quot;.

Marshall also received the Warren Alpert Prize in 1994; the Australian Medical Association Award and the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research in 1995; the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1996; the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize in 1997; the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, the Dr A.H. Heineken Prize for Medicine, the Florey Medal, and the Buchanan Medal of the Royal Society in 1998.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1999. His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads:

Barry Marshall, together with Robin Warren, discovered spiral bacteria in the stomachs of almost all patients with active chronic gastritis, or duodenal or gastric ulcers, and proposed that the bacteria were an important factor in the aetiology of these diseases. In 1985, Marshall showed by self-administration that this bacterium, now called Helicobacter pylori, causes acute gastritis and suggested that chronic colonisation directly leads to peptic ulceration. These results were a major challenge to the prevailing view that gastric disorders had a physiological basis, rather than being infectious diseases. Marshall showed that antibiotic and bismuth salt regimens that killed H. pylori resulted in the cure of duodenal ulcers. The view that gastric disorders are infectious diseases is now firmly established and there is increasing evidence for a role of H. pylori infection in gastric cancers. The work of Marshall has produced one of the most radical and important changes in medical perception in the last 50 years. Barry Marshall was awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Science in 1995 and the Buchanan Medal in 1998.

Marshall was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Life Sciences in 1999; the Keio Medical Science Prize in 2002; and the Australian Centenary Medal and Macfarlane Burnet Medal and Lecture in 2003.

Marshall was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of Oxford in 2009.

Marshall was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences (FAHMS) in 2015.

Marshall was awarded the honour of Western Australian of the Year in 2006.

Marshall was awarded The Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia (AC) in 2007.

Marshall was awarded The University of Oxford honorary Doctor of Science degree in 2009.

Marshall is the Ambassador for Life Sciences for Western Australia.

<doc id="397111" wikidata="Q1515252" url="?curid=397111" title="III Armored Corps">
<text>III Corps is a corps of the United States Army headquartered at Fort Cavazos, Texas. It is a major formation of the United States Army Forces Command.

Activated in World War I in France, III Corps oversaw US Army divisions as they repelled several major German offensives and led them into Germany. The corps was deactivated following the end of the war.

Reactivated in the interwar years, III Corps trained US Army formations for combat before and during World War II, before itself being deployed to the European Theater where it participated in several key engagements, including the Battle of the Bulge where it relieved the surrounded 101st Airborne Division.

For the next 50 years, the corps was a key training element for the US Army as it sent troops overseas in support of the Cold War, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The corps saw no combat deployments, however, until Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. , III Corps includes some of the oldest formations of their type in the US Army: 1st Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, 1st Armored Division and 1st Medical Brigade.

==History==

===World War I===
III Corps was first organized on 16 May 1918 in France. It was designed as three of the four newly activated corps of the American Expeditionary Force, which at that time numbered over one million men in 23 divisions. The corps took command of US forces training with the French Seventh Army at the same time that IV Corps took command of US forces training with the French Eighth Army.

====Aisne-Marne campaign====
In July, the corps was rushed to the Villers-Cotterêts area in preparation for the Third Battle of the Aisne, the first major Allied counteroffensive of the year. There, it was put under the French Tenth Army and given administrative command of the 1st Division and the 2nd Division which were previously under command of the French XX Corps. However, the command group arrived in the area too late to exercise tactical command, and it was instead attached to the French XX Corps. On 18 July, the attack was launched, with the force spearheading the French Tenth Army&#x27;s assault on the high ground south of Soissons. During this attack, the Corps also cut rail lines supplying the German Army.

The first day of the attack was a success, but on the second day, the Germans were reinforced with heavier weapons and were able to blunt the attack, inflicting high casualties. The force was successful despite heavy casualties, and German forces were forced to retreat. On 1 August, the corps arrived in the Vesle area near the Marne River, where it assumed command of the 3rd Division, 28th Division, and 32nd Division from the French XXXVIII Corps, placing side by side with the U.S. I Corps for a few days. Troops continued to advance until September when they withdrew to form the new First United States Army.

====Meuse-Argonne campaign====

First Army formed up in preparation to advance in the Meuse-Argonne campaign. It consisted of over 600,000 men in I Corps, III Corps, and V Corps. III Corps took the Army&#x27;s east flank, protecting it as the Army advanced to Montfaucon, then Cunel and Romagne-sous-Montfaucon. The offensive was slow and hampered by inexperience of many of the divisions under the Army&#x27;s command, though III Corps was effective in protecting its sector. They advanced through September and October, taking a few weeks for rest after the formation of Second United States Army. On 1 November, the First Army went on a general offensive, pushing north to the Meuse River and the Barricourt Ridge. It was successful, pushing German forces back and advancing to the river until the end of the war. Around that time, III Corps received its shoulder sleeve insignia, approved it by telegram, though the insignia would not be officially authorized until 1922.

The corps was demobilized in Neuwied, Germany at the close of hostilities. Following the end of World War I, III Corps remained in Europe for several months before it returned to the United States. It was demobilized at Camp Sherman, Ohio.

===Interwar period===

====III Corps (I)====

The first iteration of the III Corps was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 29 July 1921, allotted to the Third Corps Area, and assigned to the First Army. The corps headquarters was initiated on 15 December 1921 at Baltimore, Maryland, with Reserve personnel. The corps headquarters was activated about 10 April 1922 at the Dauphin Building, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with Regular Army personnel (Reserve personnel from the corps area at large remained assigned for administration, mobilization, and training purposes). The corps headquarters was responsible for providing and planning administration, organization, supply, and training for army, corps, and other nondivisional Reserve units, less field and coast artillery, in the Third Corps Area. The Headquarters Company was initiated in April 1923 with Reserve personnel at Norristown, Pennsylvania. The corps headquarters was relieved from active duty in early 1925 and all Regular Army personnel were reassigned to the Headquarters, Non-Divisional Group, Third Corps Area, which assumed the responsibilities previously held by the III Corps. Both the headquarters and the Headquarters Company remained active in the Organized Reserve

====Army reorganization====

As part of an Army reorganization beginning in August 1927 that grouped the new XX, XXI, and XXII Corps, organized in the Regular Army, under the new Seventh Army, also a Regular formation and the successor of the old First Army, as a contingency force staffed by professional soldiers rather than reservists that could immediately take control of forces and respond to any emergency, the III Corps HHC were withdrawn from the Organized Reserve and demobilized on 15 August 1927. Concurrently, all Reserve personnel were relieved from assignment. Less than two months later, however, the Seventh Army was redesignated the new First Army, and the XX, XXI, and XXII Corps as the new I, II, and III Corps, respectively.

====III Corps (II)====

The second iteration of the III Corps was constituted in the Regular Army as HHC, XXII Corps, allotted to the Third Corps Area, and assigned to the Seventh Army. Redesignated HHC, III Corps on 13 October 1927 and concurrently assigned to the First Army. The designated headquarters location for peacetime organization purposes was Baltimore, Maryland. On 1 October 1933, the corps headquarters was partially activated at Baltimore with Regular personnel from Headquarters, Third Corps Area and Reserve personnel from the corps area at large. Though a &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; unit from 1933 to 1940, the corps headquarters was occasionally organized provisionally for short periods using its assigned Reserve officers and staff officers from Headquarters, Third Corps Area. These periods of provisional active auty were generally for CPXs and major maneuvers such as the First Army maneuvers in 1935, 1939, and 1940. The designated mobilization station for the corps headquarters was Camp George G. Meade, Maryland, where it would assume command and control of its assigned subordinate corps troops which would then be mobilizing primarily in the Third Corps Area. However, the III Corps was fully activated on 18 December 1940, less Reserve personnel, at the Presidio of Monterey, California, and concurrently relieved from the First Army and assigned to the Fourth Army. Upon activation, the 8th, 28th, and 29th Divisions were relieved from the troop list and the corps assumed command and control of the 7th and 40th Divisions. The corps Headquarters Company was activated on 10 February 1941 at Fort Ord. The corps participated in the Fourth Army maneuvers in August 1941. After the maneuver, the corps returned to Monterey where it was located on 7 December 1941.

===World War II===
Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor bringing America into World War II, III Corps remained in the United States, where it was assigned to organize defenses of the West Coast, specifically California, against the threat of attack from Japan. During this time III Corps operated at Monterey, California.

The corps was moved to Fort McPherson, Georgia in early 1942 for training. After a short period, the corps returned to Monterey and on 19 August 1942, it was designated a separate corps, capable of deployment. During the next two years, III Corps would train thousands of troops for combat, including 33 division-sized units, and participate in four corps-level maneuvers, including the Louisiana Maneuvers.

On 27 June 1944, to perpetuate the lineage of the World War I-era III Corps, it was reconstituted in the Regular Army and consolidated with the active Headquarters and Headquarters Company, III Corps.

====Europe====
On 23 August 1944, the corps headquarters departed California for Camp Myles Standish in Massachusetts. It deployed for the European Theater of Operations (ETO) on 5 September 1944. Upon arrival at Cherbourg, France, III Corps, under the command of Major General John Millikin, was assigned to the Ninth Army, part of Lieutenant General Omar Bradley&#x27;s U.S. 12th Army Group, and given the code name &quot;CENTURY&quot; which it retained throughout the war. The corps headquarters was established at Carteret, in Normandy, and for six weeks, the corps received and processed all the troops of the 12th Army Group arriving over the Normandy beaches during that period. The corps also participated in the &quot;Red Ball Express&quot; by organizing 45 provisional truck companies to carry fuel and ammunition for the units on the front lines.

The corps was assigned to Lieutenant General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third Army on 10 October 1944, and moved to Etain, near Verdun, and into combat. The corps&#x27; first fighting was for the Metz region, as it was moved to attack Fort Jeanne d&#x27;Arc, one of the last forts holding out in the region. That fort fell on 13 December 1944.

Later that month on 16 December came the last German counteroffensive in the Battle of the Bulge, as over 250,000 German troops, supported by over 1,000 tanks and assault guns assaulted the lines of VIII Corps, some 40 miles to the north of III Corps. The next day Patton, the Third Army commander, warned III Corps that it would likely be ordered to assist. At that time the corps consisted of the 26th and 80th Infantry Divisions and the 4th Armored Division. III Corps was moved north to assist in the relief of Bastogne, Belgium, with the attack commencing at 04:00 on 22 December 1944. The corps advanced north, catching the German forces by surprise on their south flank, cutting them off. The 4th Armored Division was eventually able to reach Bastogne, where the 101st Airborne Division had been surrounded by German forces, and relieve it. During the first 10 days of this action, III Corps liberated more than 100 towns, including Bastogne. This operation was key in halting the German offensive and the eventual drive to the Rhine River.

During the first four months of 1945, III Corps moved quickly to the offensive. On 25 February, the corps, now as part of the First Army, established a bridgehead over the Roer River, which, in turn, led to the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, on the Rhine River, on 7 March. On 30 March, the Edersee Dam was captured intact by Task Force Wolfe of the 7th Armored Division, and the corps, now commanded by Major General James Van Fleet after Millikin&#x27;s relief, continued the attack to seize the Ruhr Pocket on 5 April 1945. In late April, III Corps reformed and launched a drive through Bavaria towards Austria. On 2 May 1945, III Corps was ordered to halt at the Inn River on the Austrian border, just days before V-E Day, when the German forces surrendered, bringing an end of World War II in Europe.

====Post-war====
At the end of the war, III Corps had added campaign streamers for Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe, had taken more than 226,102 prisoners and had seized more than of German territory. The corps had also participated in most of the critical actions from Normandy to the German-Austrian border. Its wartime commanders included Major General John Millikin and Major General James A. Van Fleet. After 13 months of occupation duty in Germany, the corps returned to Camp Polk, Louisiana, where it was inactivated on 10 October 1946.

===Cold War era===

On 15 March 1951, during the height of the Korean War, III Corps was again called to active duty at Camp Roberts, California. In April 1954, III Corps moved to Fort Hood, Texas, where it participated in a number of important exercises, either as director headquarters or as a player unit. It took command of the 1st Armored Division and the 4th Armored Division. The main purpose of these operations was the testing of new doctrines, organizations, and equipment. On 5 May 1959, the corps was again inactivated.

The Berlin crisis brought III Corps back to active duty for the fourth time on 1 September 1961. Units participated in an intensive training program and were operationally ready by December 1961. In February 1962, the Department of the Army designated III Corps as a unit of the U.S. Strategic Army Corps and in September 1965, assigned III Corps to the U.S. Strategic Army Forces. Throughout much of the 1960s, III Corps and its subordinate units trained for rapid deployment to Europe in the event of an outbreak of war there.

During the Vietnam War era, the corps supervised the training and deployment of more than 137 units and detachments to Southeast Asia, including the I and II Field Force staffs. The corps also trained more than 40,000 individual replacements for units in Vietnam, for a total of over 100,000 soldiers trained. As the war in Southeast Asia ended, the corps received many units and individual soldiers for reassignment or inactivation. It was also during this period that III Corps units participated in a number of key tests and evaluations that would help determine Army organization and equipment for the next 30 years. During this era, the corps also received its distinctive unit insignia.
In July 1973, III Corps became part of the newly established Forces Command and its training, testing, and evaluation mission began to grow. For the remainder of the decade, III Corps would take part in a number of Training and Doctrine Command tests of organizations and tactical concepts, and play a key role in the fielding of new equipment. III Corps units would also participate in major exercises such as Exercise REFORGER (Return of Forces to Germany) and disaster relief operations in the United States and Central America.

In the summer of 1974, the Army decided to implement one of the recommendations of the Howze Board and created an air cavalry combat brigade. The assets of the 2d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division were used to create the 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat). The new brigade was assigned to the III Corps as a corps asset. 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, was transferred to the new brigade on 21 February 1975. The brigade served as a test bed for new concepts involving the employment of attack helicopters on the modern battlefield. In 1985–85, the brigade consisted of 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry; 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment (4-9 CAV); and 5th and 7th Squadrons, 17th Cavalry Regiment (5-17 CAV and 7-17 CAV), all flying attack helicopters.

As part of the Army&#x27;s modernization effort in the 1980s corps units introduced new organizations and equipment including the M1 Abrams tank, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, AH-64 Apache helicopter, Multiple Launch Rocket System, and Mobile Subscriber Equipment. In 1985, a task force within the 6th Cavalry Brigade was elevated into the Apache Fielding Brigade, &quot;to receive, equip and train, evaluate, and deploy all Army non-Fort Hood Apache helicopter battalions.&quot; On August 1, 1986, then-Colonel Malvin Handy was placed in command of the brigade, with the same mission, but a slightly different name: the Apache Training Brigade. Lt Gen Saint &quot;..gave me $36 million and told me to make it happen,” Handy said. The task was daunting, even for an experienced, combat-proven attack pilot like Handy. “I thought, ‘this guy is crazy,’” he said. “I felt like Moses and some guy was handing me the Ten Commandments.&quot; Handy oversaw training of the first eight battalions, which five years later did well during Operation Desert Storm.

In 1987, III Corps also conducted the largest deployment of forces to Germany since the Second World War, Exercise Reforger &#x27;87. During this time, the corps began assisting in the training and support of active and reserve component units. This support involves training guidance, resources, and the maintenance of relationships that extend to wartime affiliations.

===1990s===
Following the end of the Cold War, III Corps headquarters itself saw no major contingencies; however, it saw numerous units under its command deploy to contingencies around the world. III Corps units were sent to Grenada, Panama, Honduras, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. In the fall of 1990, two 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat) units deployed to Iraq during Operation Desert Shield. One of those units was 2nd Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment, a Chinook battalion from Fort Hood. Other corps units also provided humanitarian support for Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. III Corps elements supported Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well.

After the Cold War, III Corps became the primary counteroffensive force for the US Army. One of the two heavy corps in Europe had disappeared. III Corps gained primary responsibility for large, conventional offensive actions.

===21st century===
In 2001, the corps was composed of the 1st Cavalry Division and the 4th Infantry Division as well as the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 13th Corps Support Command. However, with realignment of the US Army and the return of several formations from Europe, the corps took command of the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division as well, both of these units having been transferred from V Corps in Germany.

The corps headquarters saw its first combat deployment since the Second World War in 2004, when it deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom. There, III Corps headquarters assumed duties as Headquarters Multi-National Corps – Iraq, relieving V Corps. III Corps served as the administrative command for 2,500 soldiers of the Multi-National Force – Iraq command element, providing operational direction into 2005, when it was returned to Fort Hood, relieved by XVIII Airborne Corps. III Corps has for many years participated in an exchange program which sees a Canadian Army officer appointed as a deputy commanding general. Notably, Peter Devlin deployed with the corps to Iraq in 2005.

III Corps Artillery was inactivated on 8 September 2006. Henceforth the field artillery brigades, soon to become Fires Brigades, would be assigned to the corps and division headquarters directly. 

In December 2006, the corps returned to Iraq for a second time to serve as commanding headquarters for Multi-National Corps Iraq. During this 15-month deployment, the corps took command of the force at its largest with Iraq War troop surge. The corps conducted a similar mission to its first deployment, focusing on providing personnel management, training, communications, convoy escort, and other duties to support the commanding elements of Multi-National Force Iraq. III Corps fulfilled this mission until February 2008, when it returned home, again relieved by XVIII Airborne Corps.

In 2009, the corps began a number of training initiatives with the Republic of Korea Army. These included Operation Key Resolve, a command post exercise simulating major, high intensity combat operations. The exercises were held in Yongin, South Korea. These operations were designed to keep the corps familiar with commanding during large-scale conventional warfare, as opposed to counter-insurgency tactics it employed during its two tours in Iraq. Upon return to the United States, the corps conducted similar exercises at Fort Cavazos.

On 5 November 2009, a gunman opened fire in the Soldier Readiness Center of Fort Hood, killing 13 people and wounding 30 others. Nidal Hasan, a Muslim U.S. Army major and psychiatrist, was alleged to be the gunman. He was shot several times and then arrested by civilian police officers Sergeants Mark Todd and Kimberly Munley. Much of the subsequent investigation was handled by III Corps, as the soldiers killed were under the corps&#x27; chain of command.

III Corps, commanded by LTG Robert W. Cone, assumed its final Iraq mission from I Corps from Joint Base Lewis–McChord, Washington in February 2010. As the core element of United States Forces – Iraq headquarters, III Corps oversaw a theater-wide transition from full-spectrum operations to stability operations. The corps changed the counterinsurgency (COIN) fight dynamic from partnered combat operations, led by brigade combat teams, to training, advising, and assisting operations, led by brigades organized as advise and assist brigades. The corps also completed the transition to complete Iraqi lead for security operations. During the deployment, III Corps reduced the amount of aviation assets in Iraq, resulting in one enhanced combat aviation brigade with six maneuver battalions having responsibility for the entire joint operations area. III Corps also oversaw the reduction of the force in Iraq from 110,000 to 50,000 U.S. personnel by 1 Sept. 2010, which established the conditions for the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the transition to Operation New Dawn. XVIII Airborne Corps from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, assumed the Iraq follow-on mission from III Corps in February 2011.

The corps saw its first action in Afghanistan when it deployed to Kabul in early April 2013. The corps, under the command of LTG Mark A. Milley, replaced the U.S. V Corps from Stuttgart, Germany, in May 2013 and assumed the mission of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Joint Command, or IJC, which was responsible for day-to-day operations throughout Afghanistan. During the corps&#x27; deployment, IJC oversaw Milestone 13/Tranche 5 ceremony on 18 June 2013, which marked the official transition of full responsibility for nationwide security operations from ISAF to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. After the Milestone 13 ceremony, IJC transitioned from Coalition-led combat operations to Afghan-led combat operations and Coalition forces providing training, advice, and assistance. The ANSF, officially less than three years old, reached its peak of more than 350,000 members and conducted more than 70 major operations in more than 22 provinces. In November 2013, IJC forces provided technical support to the ANSF as it secured the Loya Jirga, a country-wide gathering of Afghan local leaders and officials, in Kabul. The Loya Jirga successfully laid the groundwork for a U.S.-Afghanistan Bilateral Security Agreement. During the deployment, III Corps also oversaw the drawdown of U.S. forces from more than 80,000 to 34,000 by 1 Feb. 2014. XVIII Airborne Corps from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, assumed the ISAF Joint Command mission from III Corps in March 2014.

On 22 September 2015, III Corps assumed command of CJTF-OIR from United States Army Central.

On 13 October 2020, the III Corps commander launched Operation People First at Fort Cavazos, Fort Bliss, Fort Carson, Fort Riley, and other III Corps units.

<text>The spectacled warbler (Curruca conspicillata) is a species in the typical warbler genus, &quot;Curruca&quot;. The specific &quot;conspicillata&quot; is from Latin &quot;conspicillum&quot;, a place to look from, equivalent to &quot;spectacled&quot;.

It breeds in northwest Africa, southwest Europe from Iberia to Italy, and then further east on the eastern Mediterranean islands and coastal regions. It is mainly resident in Africa, but other populations migrate to winter more widely in north and west Africa and Egypt. This bird is a rare vagrant to northern and western Europe.

It also occurs in some Atlantic islands. The subspecies &quot;orbitalis&quot; has been proposed for those of the Cape Verde Islands. The presumed subspecies for the Madeira birds, &quot;bella&quot;, is today usually included in this taxon, as are the birds of the Canary Islands, where the species is quite common except on El Hierro and known as &quot;zarzalero y ratonero&quot;.

These are very small &quot;warblers&quot; and are intermediate between common whitethroats and Tristram&#x27;s warbler in coloration. Spectacled warblers are brown above and buff below, with chestnut wing patches and a white throat. Adult males have a grey head and the white eye ring which gives the species its name. Immature birds can be confused with both the whitethroat and the western subalpine warbler, and identification is difficult in the field. The song is a fast high warble.

About the precise relationships of this bird, not much can be said with certainty. It seems as if its intermediate appearance, apart from the autapomorphic white eye ring, indicates its relationships reasonably well. At least, it is not the closest living relative of Tristram&#x27;s warbler.

These small passerine birds are found in dry open country with bushes. 3-6 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush. Like its relatives, the spectacled warbler is insectivorous.

<text>Kazuhiro Sasaki (佐々木 主浩 &quot;Sasaki Kazuhiro&quot;, born February 22, 1968) is a Japanese former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played his entire Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) career with the Yokohama Taiyō Whales / Yokohama BayStars (1990–1999; 2004–2005), and played his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the Seattle Mariners (2000–2003). His nickname &quot;Daimajin&quot; was named after the tokusatsu character of the same name, and Sasaki has participated in advertisements and several collaborations with the franchise.

==Professional career==
After playing college baseball for Tohoku Fukushi University, Sasaki was drafted in the first round of the 1989 draft by the Yokohama Taiyō Whales (now named Yokohama DeNA BayStars) in Japan&#x27;s Central League. He played for them from 1990 to 1999, before joining the Seattle Mariners in 2000, on a 2-year, $9 million contract with a club option for 2002. He joined a bullpen that had been one of the worst in the major leagues, and during his rookie year won the closer job from a floundering José Mesa. Sasaki&#x27;s out pitch, a devastating split-fingered fastball that drops when arriving at home plate, was nicknamed &quot;The Thang&quot; by Mariners radio announcers. He complemented it with a four-seam fastball that topped out at mid-90s. Sasaki maintained a rigorous throwing program, sometimes at odds with club management, that saw him throw up to 100 pitches following games in which he did not appear.

Sasaki&#x27;s transition to American baseball began with his being named American League Rookie of the Year, in a season where had 3.16 ERA in 63 games with 37 saves. For the next three years, along with Jeff Nelson and Arthur Rhodes, Sasaki was an integral member of the back of Seattle&#x27;s bullpen. In 2001, Sasaki had 45 saves, with 3.24 ERA in 69 games, and earned his first All-Star nod, as well as received down-ballot MVP votes. The 2002 season was to be his final season before free agency, but Sasaki instead signed an extension that kept him under contract until 2004, with a 2005 club option. In that year, Sasaki again made the All-Star team, pitching in 61 games, with a 2.52 ERA and 37 saves. In what would be his final MLB season, the 2003 season was a struggle for Sasaki, as he appeared in only 35 games, while dealing with injuries to his lower back and ribcage, he had a career-worst 4.05 ERA and only 10 saves. Following that season, he decided to leave the Mariners before the last year of his contract in 2004, giving up $8 million, citing his desire to be with his family in Japan. According to the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, however, Sasaki&#x27;s real reason for returning to Japan was pressure from ownership, due to his &quot;indiscreet philandering&quot;.

Sasaki resumed his career with the BayStars upon returning to Japan, where he pitched for another year. But in his second year back, nagging knee and elbow injuries resulted in his release from Yokohama and subsequent retirement. His last official appearance came as a cameo against the Yomiuri Giants on August 9, 2005, as he struck out his longtime friend and rival Kazuhiro Kiyohara in a game played at Fullcast Stadium Miyagi in his hometown.

In addition to his Rookie of the Year award, Sasaki set several Japanese professional baseball records, including saves (45) and save opportunities (46) for a single season in 1998; he was twice selected to play in the All-Star game, and was selected to eight All-Star teams in Japan. Sasaki&#x27;s 37 saves in his rookie season with the Seattle Mariners remained a Major League Baseball record for saves by a rookie, until Neftalí Feliz broke it in 2010 with 40.

==Personal life==
In 1991, Sasaki married former idol singer Kaori Shimizu. Together they had two children.

After returning to Japan in 2005, Sasaki continued his affair with actress Kanako Enomoto, who was 13 years his junior. When Enomoto became pregnant, Shimizu divorced Sasaki on March 18, 2005. Enomoto gave birth prematurely on April 29, 2005.

Sasaki&#x27;s interest in sports extends outside baseball. In 2002 and 2003, he lent his name to a team in Formula Nippon, an auto racing series in Japan. His Team 22 won two races in that time. He is currently the general representative of D&#x27;Station Racing in the Super GT series.

Sasaki is also a successful race horse owner, with many of his horses being a dam of . Notable horses Sasaki has owned include Verxina, named by Enomoto, who won the Victoria Mile twice, Vivlos, winner of the Shūka Sho and of the 2017 Dubai Turf race on Dubai World Cup Night, and Cheval Grand, winner of the 2017 Japan Cup.

Sasaki has appeared as a judge on the &quot;Iron Chef&quot; television program. He had a side recording career, with an album of his vocals over techno beats.

Sasaki chose 22 for his uniform number because he was born at 2:22 on February 22 (2/22). The BayStars have permanently honored his number.

<text>(Akkadian Cuneiform: , also spelled &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;), meaning &quot;When on High&quot;, is a Babylonian creation myth (named after its opening words) from the late 2nd millennium BCE and the only complete surviving account of ancient near eastern cosmology. It was recovered by English archaeologist Austen Henry Layard in 1849 (in fragmentary form) in the ruined Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh (Mosul, Iraq). A form of the myth was first published by English Assyriologist George Smith in 1876; active research and further excavations led to near completion of the texts and improved translation.

&quot;Enūma Eliš&quot; has about a thousand lines and is recorded in Akkadian on seven clay tablets, each holding between 115 and 170 lines of Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform script. Most of Tablet V has never been recovered, but, aside from this lacuna, the text is almost complete.

Over the seven tablets, it describes the creation of the world, a battle between gods focused on the offering to Marduk, the creation of man destined for the service of the Mesopotamian deities, and it ends with a long passage praising Marduk. The rise of Marduk is generally viewed to have started from the Second Dynasty of Isin, triggered by the return of the statue of Marduk from Elam by Nebuchadnezzar I, although a late Kassite date is also sometimes proposed. It may have been recited during the Akitu festival.

Some late Assyrian versions replace Marduk with Ashur.

== Background and discovery ==
Before the tablets were discovered, substantial elements of the myth had survived via the writings of Berossus, primarily his Babyloniaca, a 3rd-century BCE Babylonian writer and priest of Bel (Marduk). These were preserved in Alexander Polyhistor&#x27;s book on Chaldean History, which was reproduced by Eusebius in Book 1 of his &quot;Chronicon&quot;. In it are described the primeval state of an abyssal darkness and water, the two primeval beings existing therein, said to be of a twofold principle. The description then relates the creation of further beings, partly human but with variants of wings, animal heads and bodies, and some with both sex organs. (Berossus states images of these are to be found at the temple of Bel in Babylon.) The text also describes a female being leading over them, named as Omoroca, called Thalatth in Babylonian (derived from Greek), and her slaying by Bel, who cut her in half, forming Heaven of one part and Earth of the other. This Berossus claims to have been an allegory. The text also describes the beheading of a god, and the mixing of the god&#x27;s blood with the Earth&#x27;s soil, leading to the creation of men (people). Finally, there is also reference to Bel&#x27;s creation of the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets. Berossus also gave an account of the sage Oannes, a sort of fish-man hybrid, who appeared from the sea and taught people all manner of knowledge, including writing, lawmaking, construction, mathematics, and agriculture; Berossus presented the account of creation in the form of a speech given by the Oannes. The neo-Platonist Damascius also gave a short version of the Babylonian cosmological view, which closely matches .

Clay tablets containing inscriptions relating to analogues of biblical stories were discovered by A. H. Layard, Hormuzd Rassam, and George Smith in the ruins of the Palace and Library of Ashurbanipal (668–626 BCE) during excavations at the mound of Kuyunjik, Nineveh (near Mosul) between 1848 and 1876. Smith worked through Rassam&#x27;s find of around 20,000 fragments from 1852, and identified references to the kings Shalmaneser II, Tiglath-Pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and other rulers mentioned in the Bible. Furthermore, he discovered versions of a Babylonian deluge myth (see Gilgamesh flood myth), as well as creation myths.

On examination it became clear that the Assyrian myths were drawn from or similar to the Babylonian ones. Additionally Sir Henry Rawlinson had noted similarities between Biblical accounts of creation and the geography of Babylonia. He suggested that biblical creation stories might have their origin in that area. A link was found on a tablet labelled K 63 at the British Museum&#x27;s collection by Smith, as well as similar text on other tablets. Smith then began searching the collection for textual similarities between the two myths, and found several references to a deluge myth with an &#x27;Izdubar&#x27; (literal translation of cuneiform for Gilgamesh). Smith&#x27;s publication of his work led to an expedition to Assyria funded by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. There he found further tablets describing the deluge as well as fragmentary accounts of creation, a text on a war between good and evil &#x27;gods&#x27;, and a fall of man myth. A second expedition by Smith brought back further creation legend fragments. By 1875 he had returned and began publishing accounts of these discoveries in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; from 4 March 1875.

Smith speculated that the creation myth, including a part describing the fall of man, might originally have spanned at least nine or ten tablets. He also identified tablets the themes of which were, in part, closer to the account given by Berossus. Some of Smith&#x27;s early correspondences, such as references to the stories of the temptation of Eve, to the Tower of Babel, and to instructions given from God (Yahweh) to Adam and Eve, were later held to be erroneous.

The connection with the Bible stories brought a great deal of additional attention to the tablets, in addition to Smith&#x27;s early scholarship on the tablets, early translation work included that done by E. Schrader, A. H. Sayce, and Jules Oppert. In 1890 P. Jensen published a translation and commentary , followed by an updated translation in his 1900 ; in 1895 Prof. Zimmern of Leipzig gave a translation of all known fragments, , shortly followed by a translation by Friedrich Delitzsch, as well as contributions by several other authors.

In 1898, the trustees of the British Museum ordered publication of a collection of all the Assyrian and Babylonian creation texts held by them, a work which was undertaken by L. W. King. King concluded that the creation myth as known in Nineveh was originally contained on seven tablets. This collection was published 1901 as Part XIII of &quot;Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum&quot; . King published his own translations and notes in two volumes with additional material 1902 as &quot;The Seven Tablets of Creation, or the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends concerning the creation of the world and of mankind&quot; . By then additional fragments of tablet six had been found, concerning the creation of man; here Marduk was found to have made man from his blood combined with bone, which brought comparison with Genesis 2:23 (&quot;This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called &#x27;woman&#x27;, for she was taken out of man&quot;) where the creation of woman required the use of a man&#x27;s bone.

New material contributing to the fourth and sixth tablets also further corroborated other elements of Berossus&#x27; account. The seventh tablet added by King was a praise of Marduk, using around fifty titles over more than one hundred lines of cuneiform. Thus King&#x27;s composition of consisted of five parts: the birth of gods, legend of Ea and Apsu, Tiamat primeval serpent myth, account of creation, and finally a hymn to Marduk using his many titles. Importantly, tablets, both Assyrian and Babylonian, when possessing colophons had the number of the tablet inscribed.

Further expeditions by German researchers uncovered further tablet fragments (specifically tablet 1, 6, and 7) during the period 1902–1914. These works replaced Marduk with the Assyrian god Ashur; additional important sources for tablets 1 and 6, and tablet 7 were discovered by expeditions in 1924–25 and 1928–29 respectively. The Ashur texts uncovered by the Germans necessitated some corrections: it was Kingu, not Marduk, who was killed and whose blood made men. These discoveries were further supplemented by purchases from antiquity dealers. As a result, by the mid 20th century most of the text of the work was known, with the exception of tablet 5. These further discoveries were complemented by a stream of publications and translations in the early 20th century.

In the 21st century, the text remains a subject of active research, analysis, and discussion. Significant publications include: &quot;The Standard Babylonian Creation Myth &quot; ; ; &quot;Babylonian Creation Myths&quot; ; &quot;: &quot; ; and other works still.

=== Date ===

The earliest manuscript of the myth was excavated from Assur and dated to the 9th century BCE. 

While it used to be viewed that Enuma Elish was composed in the reign of Hammurabi, most scholars now believe it is unlikely and accept a dating to the Second Dynasty of Isin. During the Old Babylonian period, Marduk was not the pantheon head, appearing instead as the mediator between the great gods and Hammurabi, and there is no evidence that Hammurabi or his successors promoted Marduk at the expense of the other gods. It was during the Second Dynasty of Isin that Marduk started to be referred to as the king of the gods, with the return of the statue of Marduk from Elam by Nebuchadnezzar I. Sommerfield&#x27;s suggestion that Enuma Elish should be dated instead to the Kassite period, was countered by Lambert, but the god list An = Anum does give the number 50, which traditionally belongs to Enlil, to Marduk. Dalley still proposes that Enuma Elish was written during the Old Babylonian Period, but other scholars find her proposal unlikely.

=== Variants ===
Numerous copies of the tablets exist. Even by 1902 fragments of four copies of the first tablet were known, as well as extracts, possibly examples of &#x27;handwriting practice&#x27;. Tablets from the library of Ashur-bani-pal tended to be well written on fine clay, whereas the Neo-Babylonian tablets were often less well written and made, though fine examples existed. All tablets, both Assyrian and Babylonian had the text in lines, not columns, and the form of the text was generally identical between both.

A tablet at the British Museum (No 93014), known as the &quot;bilingual&quot; version of the creation legend, describes the creation of man and animals (by Marduk with the aid of Aruru), as well as the creation of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, of land and plants, as well as the first houses and cities.

Other variants of the creation myth can be found described in and .

== Text ==
The epic itself does not rhyme, and has no meter; it is composed of couplets, usually written on the same line, occasionally forming quatrains. The title , meaning &quot;when on high&quot;, is the incipit.

The following per-tablet summary is based on the translation in &quot;Akkadian Myths and Epics&quot; (E. A. Speiser), in &quot;Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament&quot; .

=== Tablet 1 ===

The tale begins before creation, when only the primordial entities Apsu and Tiamat existed, co-mingled together. There were no other things or gods, nor had any destinies been foretold. Then from the mixture of Apsu and Tiamat two gods issued – Lahmu and Lahamu; next Anshar and Kishar were created. From Anshar came firstly the god Anu, and from Anu, came Nudimmud (also known as Ea).

The commotion of these new gods disturbed and disgusted Apsu, and Apsu could not calm them. Apsu called Mummu to speak with Tiamat, and he proposed to destroy the new gods, but Tiamat was reluctant to destroy what they had made. Mummu advised Apsu to destroy them, and he embraced Mummu. The new gods heard of this and were worried; Ea, however, crafted a spell to lull Apsu to sleep.

Mummu sought to wake Apsu but could not. Ea took Apsu&#x27;s halo and wore it himself, slew Apsu, and chained Mummu. Apsu became the dwelling place of Ea, together with his wife Damkina. Within the heart of Apsu, Ea and Damkina created Marduk. The splendor of Marduk exceeded Ea and the other gods, and Ea called him &quot;My son, the Sun!&quot; Anu created the four winds.

Other gods taunted Tiamat: &quot;When your consort (Apsu) was slain you did nothing&quot;, and complained of the wearisome wind. Tiamat then made monsters to battle the other gods, eleven chimeric creatures with weapons, with the god Kingu chief of the war party and her new consort. She gave Kingu the &#x27;Tablet of Destinies&#x27;, making his command unchallengeable.

=== Tablet 2 ===

Ea heard of Tiamat&#x27;s plan to fight and avenge Apsu. He spoke to his grandfather Anshar, telling that many gods had gone to Tiamat&#x27;s cause, and that she had created eleven monstrous creatures fit for war, and made Kingu their leader, wielding the &#x27;Tablet of Destinies&#x27;. Anshar was troubled and told Anu to go to appease Tiamat, but he was too weak to face her and turned back. Anshar became more worried, thinking no god could resist Tiamat.

Finally, Anshar proposed Marduk as their champion. Marduk was brought forth, and asked what god he must fightto which Anshar replied that it was not a god but the goddess Tiamat. Marduk confidently predicted his victory, but exacted their promise to proclaim him supreme god, with authority over even Anshar.

=== Tablet 3 ===
Anshar spoke to Gaga, who advised him to fetch Lahmu and Lahamu and tell them of Tiamat&#x27;s war plans, and of Marduk&#x27;s demand for overlordship if he defeats her. Lahmu and Lahamu and other Igigi (heavenly gods) were distressed, but drank together, becoming drowsy, and finally approving the compact with Marduk.

=== Tablet 4 ===
Marduk was given a throne, and sat over the other gods, who honored him.

Marduk was also given a sceptre and vestments, as well as weapons to fight Tiamat – bow, quiver, mace, and bolts of lightning, together with the four winds. His body was aflame.

Using the four winds Marduk trapped Tiamat. Adding a whirlwind, a cyclone, and Imhullu (&quot;the Evil Wind&quot;), together the seven winds stirred up Tiamat. In his war chariot drawn by four creatures he advanced. He challenged Tiamat, stating she had unrightfully made Kingu her consort, accusing her of being the source of the trouble. Enraged, Tiamat joined Marduk in single combat.

Marduk used a net, a gift from Anu, to entangle Tiamat; Tiamat attempted to swallow Marduk, but &#x27;the Evil Wind&#x27; filled her mouth. With the winds swirling within her she became distended. Marduk then shot his arrow, hitting her heart – she was slain. The other gods attempted to flee but Marduk captured them, broke their weapons, and netted them. Her eleven monsters were also captured and chained, whilst Kingu was imprisoned, and the &#x27;Tablet of Destinies&#x27; taken from him. Marduk then smashed Tiamat&#x27;s head with the mace, while her blood was carried off by the North Wind.

Marduk then split Tiamat&#x27;s remains in two. From one half he made the sky; in it he made places for Anu, Enlil, and Ea.

=== Tablet 5 ===

Marduk made likenesses of the gods in the constellations, and defined the days of the year from them. He created night and day, and the moon also. He created clouds and rain, and their water made the Tigris and Euphrates. He gave the &#x27;Tablet of Destinies&#x27; to Anu.

Statues of the eleven monsters of Tiamat were made and installed at the gate of Apsu.

=== Tablet 6 ===
Marduk then spoke to Ea, saying he would use his own blood to create man, and that man would serve the gods. Ea advised one of the gods be chosen as a sacrifice; the Igigi advised that Kingu be chosen. His blood was then used to create man.

Marduk then divided the gods into &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot; – three hundred in the heavens, six hundred on earth. The gods then proposed to build a throne or shrine for him; Marduk told them to construct Babylon. The gods then spent a year making bricks; they built the Esagila (Temple to Marduk) to a great height, making it a place for Marduk, Ea, and Enlil.

A banquet was then held, with fifty of the great gods taking seats, Anu praising Enlil&#x27;s bow and then Marduk.

The first nine names or titles of Marduk were given.

=== Tablet 7 ===

The remainder of Marduk&#x27;s fifty names or titles were read.

=== Colophon ===

Tablets Smith examined also contained attributions on the rear of the tablet. The first tablet contained eight lines of a colophon. Smith&#x27;s reconstruction and translation of this states:

== Significance, interpretation, and ritual use ==

Due to the nature of , it is generally advised to be wary of simply taking the text as a representative of Mesopotamian creation myths. Enuma Elish references multiple myths and other texts, and epithets usually attested in royal inscriptions were given to Marduk. Similarities with the Anzu myth are commonly observed, such as both myths using the Tablet of Destinies as a key object and the similarities between the weapons used by Ninurta and Marduk, and lines from the Anzu myth were adapted to fit the story of Enuma Elish, such as Anzu&#x27;s feathers being blown off by the wind being adjusted to having Tiamat&#x27;s blood being blown off by the wind. Marduk using floods and storms as a weapon and using a net to capture Tiamat (the personified sea) does not make logical sense, but they were weapons that Ninurta used in the Anzu myth and in Lugal-e, and usage of a net would make sense against Anzu. Other traditions related to Ninurta were also applied to Marduk in Enuma Elish, such as the name of one of Ninurta&#x27;s weapons (long wood) being given to Marduk’s bow. While it would make sense to simply write this off as Marduk using Ninurta&#x27;s model simply because it was the closest match, the traditions involving Ninurta were already used to allude to heroism in the epic of Gilgamesh, and imageries of Ninurta played an important part of Neo-Assyrian ideology.

Outside of the Anzu myth, similarities between Enuma Elish and the Atrahasis epic were also pointed out. Both Apsu and Enlil wanted to destroy a source of noise which prevented them from falling asleep (for Enlil, this was humanity and for Apsu, this was his offspring). Both Nintu and Tiamat then lament their fate. Wisnom further suggests that the similarities between the beginning of Enuma Elish and Atrahasis was to have Apsu remind people of Enlil, thus the overthrowing of Apsu symbolically represents the dethronement of Enlil, the old head of the pantheon. Enlil is conspicuously missing in most of Enuma Elish, only appearing to offer his title to Marduk, and Marduk receives fifty names, the number of Enlil.

Other comparisons were also drawn, such as the description of Marduk&#x27;s awe with the description in Marduk&#x27;s Address to the Demons, and the creation of the universe at the beginning of Tablet X with Tablet XXII of the astronomical series Enuma Anu Enlil. In Enuma Anu Enlil, the creation of the universe was credited to Anu, Enlil and Ea, while in Enuma Elish the creation of the universe was credited to Marduk while Enlil and Ea were assigned a position.

The myth of a god (usually a storm god) fighting the sea is well known in the Ancient Near East, including myths such as the Song of Hedammu, the Baal cycle, the Illuyanka myth, and the Astarte papyrus. In the Song of Hedammu and the Illuyanka Myth the sea acts as a sort of breeding ground for the god&#x27;s enemies, as both Hedammu and Illuyanka were sea monsters. The Song of the Sea, suggested to belong to the Kumarbi Cycle, likely narrates the story of the storm god Teshub fighting the sea god, although the text is damaged and fragmentary. The Astarte Papyrus also mentioned a struggle with the sea, and the Ugaritic Baal Cycle had Baal Hadad fight for his position from Yam.

A ritual text from the Seleucid period states that was recited during the Akitu festival. There is scholarly debate as to whether this reading occurred, its purpose, and even the identity of the text referred to. Most analysts consider that the festival concerned and included some form of re-enactment of Tiamat&#x27;s defeat by Marduk, representing a renewal cycle and triumph over chaos. However a more detailed analysis by Jonathan Z. Smith led him to argue that the ritual should be understood in terms of its post-Assyrian and post-Babylonian imperial context, and may include elements of psychological and political theater legitimizing the non-native Seleucid rulers; he also questions whether read during that period was the same as that known to the ancient Assyrians. Whether creation myth was created for the Akitu ritual, or &quot;vice versa&quot;, or neither, is unclear; nevertheless there are definite connections in subject matter between the myth and festival, and there is also evidence of the festival as celebrated during the neo-Babylonian period that correlates well with myth. A version of is also thought to have been read during the month of Kislimu.

It has been suggested that ritual reading of the poem coincided with spring flooding of the Tigris or Euphrates following the melting of snow in mountainous regions upstream. This interpretation is supported by the defeat of the (watery being) Tiamat by Marduk.

==Influence on biblical research==
 contains numerous parallels with passages of the Old Testament, which has led some researchers to conclude that these were based on the Mesopotamian work. Overarching similarities include: reference to a watery chaos before creation; a separation of the chaos into heaven and earth; different types of waters and their separation; and the numerical similarity between the seven tablets of the epic and the seven days of creation. However, another analysis notes many differences, including polytheism vs. monotheism, and personification of forces and qualities in the Babylonian myth vs. imperative creation by God in the biblical stories; permanence of matter vs. creation out of nothing; and the lack of any real parallel for Marduk&#x27;s long battles with monsters. He also notes some broad commonalities of both texts with other religions, such as a &quot;watery chaos&quot; found in Egyptian, Phoenician, and Vedic works; and that both texts were written in languages with a common Semitic root. Regarding the creation of man, there are similarities in the use of dust or clay, but man&#x27;s efficiency is inverted in the two texts: in they are created as already qualifying as acting as servant of gods, whereas in Genesis, by being given more agency, room for failure is introduced. Nevertheless in both, the dust is infused with &quot;godhood&quot;, either through a god&#x27;s blood in , or by being made in God&#x27;s image in Genesis. As to the seven tablets and seven days of each system, the numbered itineraries in general do not closely match, but there are some commonalities in order of the creation events: first darkness, then light, the firmament, dry land, and finally man, followed by a period of rest.

Different theories have been proposed to explain the parallels. Based on an analysis of proper names in the texts, A. T. Clay proposed that was a combination of a Semitic myth from Amurru and a Sumerian myth from Eridu. This theory is thought to lack historical or archaeological evidence. An alternative theory posits a westward spread of the Mesopotamian myth to other cultures such as the Hebrews; additionally, the Hebrews would have been influenced by Mesopotamian culture during their Babylonian captivity. A third explanation supposes a common ancestor for both religious systems.

Conrad Hyers of the Princeton Theological Seminary suggests that Genesis, rather than adopting earlier Babylonian and other creation myths, polemically addressed them to &quot;repudiate the divinization of nature and the attendant myths of divine origins, divine conflict, and divine ascent&quot;. According to this theory, elaborated the interconnections between the divine and inert matter, while the aim of Genesis was to state the supremacy of the Hebrew God Yahweh Elohim over all creation (and all other deities).

The broken tablet seems to refer to a concept of sabbath. A contextual restoration contains the rarely attested or as the full moon, cognate or merged with Hebrew (cf. ), but monthly rather than weekly; it is regarded as a form of Sumerian (&quot;mid-rest&quot;), attested in Akkadian as (&quot;day of mid-repose&quot;). The reconstructed text reads: &quot;[Sa]bbath shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly.&quot;

The &#x27;Ain Samiya goblet, found in a tomb near modern Ramallah, is believed to depict scenes similar to and illustrates a clear influence from Mesopotamia on Canaan during the Middle Bronze Age. The depictions of a double headed god and the creation of the world from a dragon provide the earliest evidence of the epic&#x27;s composition.

<text>The  (, &quot;Society of the Sons of Liberty&quot;) was a paramilitary organization founded in August 1837 in Lower Canada (now Quebec).

== History ==
The society was founded by young supporters of the who became impatient with the pace of progress of the movement for constitutional and parliamentary reforms. One of the principal founder was young Amédée Papineau, the son of the famous politician Louis-Joseph Papineau. The organization took its name from the American Sons of Liberty founded by Samuel Adams during the American Revolution.

The held its first public assembly on September 5 and began to recruit men to form militias. A public assembly was held every Monday after its foundation. It published a manifesto on October 4 and adopted a national anthem for Canada. The organization had two sections: a civil one, led by André Ouimet, Louis-Joseph Papineau, and Edmund Bailey O&#x27;Callaghan, and a military one, led by Thomas Storrow Brown.

Amédée Papineau came up with the motto of the société &quot;En avant&quot; (French for &quot;go forward&quot;).

Various organizations had already been formed and pressured Governor Lord Gosford to act and quell the upcoming rebellion before lives were lost and property destroyed. At the Assemblée des Six-Comtés, on October 23, those in attendance sanctioned the . However, the organization disappeared shortly after the confrontation with the Doric Club on November 6.

Following the November 16 order to arrest 26 Patriote leaders on charges of sedition, including Papineau, O&#x27;Callaghan, Brown, and Ouimet, many members of the took part in the armed conflict of 1837 and in both invasion attempts of 1838.

<doc id="397127" wikidata="Q2823561" url="?curid=397127" title="Act of Union 1840">
<text>The British North America Act, 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 35), also known as the Act of Union 1840, () was approved by Parliament in July 1840 and proclaimed February 10, 1841, in Montreal. It abolished the legislatures of Lower Canada and Upper Canada and established a new political entity, the Province of Canada to replace them.

== Background ==

=== Rebellion of Lower Canada ===
After the War of 1812, the elected assembly of Lower Canada was dominated by French Canadians. A strong sense of nationalism sprung up among the francophones living in Lower Canada. The nationalists were led by Louis-Joseph Papineau, who was a part of what would later be known as the Patriot Party. One of its biggest demands was to determine how the colony&#x27;s revenue would be spent. It challenged the authority of the upper house of the legislature. As well, the party sought to take control of civil services such as the executive council, which advised the sitting governor-general.

All the demands were refuted by the Governor General, the Earl of Dalhousie, who was the governor general of British North America from 1820 to 1828. However, in 1828, he was replaced because of a negative report given by members of parliament comprising British reformers who sought to make peace with the Lower Canadian Assembly. The next governor general was Sir James Kempt, who lasted from 1828 to 1830. Kempt&#x27;s time in office briefly eased tensions between the Patriot Party and the existing government. The next two governors general, Lord Aylmer (1830–1835) and Lord Gosford (1835–1838), also sought to reconcile the government with the ever-growing demands of the people. The situation in Lower Canada continued to worsen, nevertheless.

The French and the English living in Lower Canada became increasingly polarized from one another, as tensions continue to grow. The Patriot Party tried to reason with British rule, including by sending the Ninety-Two Resolutions. The British Parliament ignored the resolutions for about three years and then all but dismissed them.

Eventually, the Patriot Party organized and executed two rebellions, the first in November 1837 and the second in November 1838. French and English Patriots battled with British soldiers, French Canadian officers and English Montrealers. Both times, a lack of organization and numbers made the Patriots fall within a week of the rebellions&#x27; start.

=== Rebellion in Upper Canada ===
The rebellion in Upper Canada in 1837 was less violent than its counterpart in Lower Canada had been. However, Upper Canadian rebels were equally serious in their demands. The main leader of the rebellion was William Lyon Mackenzie. Its demands included democratic reform and the end of the rule of privileged oligarchy.

The rebellion in Upper Canada ran from December 5 to 8. The transfer of some of Britain&#x27;s militia force to Lower Canada inspired rebels to try to seize the government and institute the constitution they had drafted, similar to that of the US Constitution. The rebels were dispersed by British arms and a group of government volunteers.

=== Effects of the rebellions ===
Because of the rebellions, the Crown and the British Parliament sent John George Lambton, Earl of Durham, back to Canada to report on what had caused the rebellions and outline suggestions on how to best fix the situation.

The investigation is now commonly known as the Durham Report. Because of suggestions by Lord Durham in his report, the British Parliament united Upper and Lower Canada as the Province of Canada.

== History ==

Lord Durham wanted to re-instate peace throughout the colonies and recommended a political union. It was under his belief that peace could best be achieved by ensuring a loyal English majority in British North America, as well as by anglicizing French Canadians, and by granting responsible government. The union was also proposed to solve pressing financial issues in Upper Canada, which had become increasingly indebted under the previous regime dominated by the Family Compact. These debts stemmed mostly from poor investments in canals connecting Upper Canada to the Port of Montreal in Lower Canada via the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River. Due to Upper Canada&#x27;s considerable debt and chronic budget shortfalls, it was hoped that its finances could be salvaged by merging it with the then-solvent Lower Canada.

Upper Canada, with its British and Protestant majority, was growing more rapidly than Lower Canada, with the French-Canadian and Catholic majority. It was hoped that by merging the two colonies, the French-Canadian cultural presence in North America would gradually disappear through assimilation. As such, the act also contained measures banning the French language from official use in the Canadian parliament. However, despite the amalgamation, the distinct legal systems of the two colonies were retained with Upper Canada becoming referred to as Canada West (with English common law) and Lower Canada as Canada East (with French civil law). In Upper Canada, there was opposition to unionization from the Family Compact, while in Lower Canada political and religious leaders reacted against Upper Canada&#x27;s anti-French measures.

== Main provisions ==
The act established a single parliament with an equal number of seats for each region, now called Canada East and Canada West. Both regions’ debts were consolidated. A permanent Civil List was created. The French language was banished from official government use.

The legislation to fuse the two separate colonies into one functioning unit that would operate under one government instead of two separate legislatures was brought before the British House of Commons in May 1839. Later the legislation was sent for approval by both Upper and Lower Canada by way of Charles Poulett Thomson. He received acceptance of the legislation by both colonies in November and December of the same year. The legislation then became an act in July 1840 when passed by the British Parliament. On the 10 of February 1841, it was declared in Montreal, officially marking the beginning of the newly formed Province of Canada. The capital was moved to Kingston.

One of the main provisions of the act was establishing a single parliament with an equal number of seats per region. Canada West, with its 450,000 inhabitants, was represented by 42 seats in the Legislative Assembly, the same number as the more populated Canada East, with 650,000 inhabitants. The French-Canadian majority, as well as numerous anglophones, considered this an injustice. In Lower Canada, Louis-Joseph Papineau demanded representation by population and the recall of the union the minute he entered the new parliament of the united Canadas. Debts from Upper and Lower Canada were also combined and transferred to the Province of Canada.

The granting of responsible government to the colony is typically attributed to reforms in 1848 (principally the effective transfer of control over patronage from the governor to the elected ministry). The reforms resulted in the appointment of the second Baldwin-Lafontaine government that quickly removed many of the disabilities on French-Canadian political participation in the colony.

== Effects ==
By the late 1850s, massive immigration from the British Isles to Canada West changed the previous demographic imbalance between the English and French sections of the colony. Many politicians in Canada West began to lobby for representation by population, as they no longer considered the equal representation mandated by the &quot;Act of Union&quot; to be just.

In the end, the &quot;Act of Union&quot; failed at shutting down French Canadian political influence, especially after responsible government was granted to the colony. By voting &quot;en bloc&quot; the francophones of Canada East guaranteed a strong, unified presence in the Legislative Assembly since the anglophones of Canada West were highly factionalized. As a result, bills proposed by one of the anglophone Canada West factions required the support of the francophone Canada East votes to be passed. That was known as the double majority principle and reflected the duality of the two administrations. The principle was never officially recognized and became obviously impracticable.

However, the francophone presence remained inferior to their demographic weight in the executive and legislative councils. The government of Lafontaine-Baldwin succeeded in repealing the measure against the French language in the assembly, the courts, and the civil administration. With the double majority principle, both Canadas were &quot;reseparated,&quot; and for a short while, both sides were managed independently. Joint premierships shared by an anglophone from Canada West and a francophone from Canada East became the convention, but continual legislative deadlock resulting from the conflicting aspirations of the two Canadas remained. Dissatisfaction resulting from the deadlock was one of the main factors for Canadian Confederation in 1867.

<doc id="397128" wikidata="Q3151855" url="?curid=397128" title="Institut canadien de Montréal">
<text>The Institut canadien de Montréal (, ) was founded on 17 December 1844, by a group of 200 young liberal professionals in Montreal, Canada East, Province of Canada. The Institute provided a public library and debating room for its members. At the time, there were no French-language universities nor public libraries in Montreal. Between 1845 and 1871, some 136 lectures were held inside the Institute&#x27;s walls. The Institute eventually came into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church over the contents of its library. Partly as a result of the dispute with the Church, the Institute eventually folded in the 1870s.
==Origins==

The Institute was founded in 1844 as a literary and scientific institution, for the purposes of providing a library, reading-room, and other educational purposes. Joseph Papin was the first president. In 1853, it was incorporated by an Act of the Province of Canada. At the time of incorporation, the Institute had over 500 members, a library of over 2000 volumes, and a reading-room with newspapers and periodical publications.

The Institute was the source of the ideas defended by the &quot;Parti rouge&quot;. One of its mottos was: &quot;Justice pour nous, justice pour tous; Raison et liberté pour nous, raison et liberté pour tous&quot; (Justice for us, justice for all; reason and liberty for us, reason and liberty for all).

The library contained literary works by French romantic authors, such as Victor Hugo and Alphonse de Lamartine, and Enlightenment authors, such as Voltaire and Diderot, whose writings were judged immoral by the Catholic Church. Between 1845 and 1871, some 136 lectures were held inside the institute&#x27;s walls.

==Dispute with the Church==

In 1858, an issue arose about the contents of the library. At a meeting of the Institute, some members proposed establishing a committee to review the library and to make a list of books which should not be allowed to remain in the library. This proposal was defeated by a considerable majority, which instead passed a resolution that the Institute&#x27;s library did not contain any improper books, that the Institute was the sole judge of the morality of the books in the library, and that the existing committee of management was sufficient. Following this motion, a group of 158 members left the institute to found the &quot;Institut canadien-français de Montréal&quot;, which opted to obey the doctrine of the Catholic clergy and did not lend books which the Church judged immoral.

On 13 April 1858, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Montreal, Mgr Ignace Bourget, published a pastoral which was read in all the churches of his diocese. In the pastoral, he referred to the proceedings at the Institute and praised the conduct of the minority. He stated that the majority had fallen into two great errors: by declaring that the members of the Institute were the proper judges of the morality of the books in their library, contrary to the declaration at the Council of Trent which held that judging the morality of books is a function of the bishop; and by declaring that the library contained no immoral books, when in fact it contained books on the Church&#x27;s Index of Prohibited Books. He pointed out that the Council of Trent had held that anyone who read or kept heretical works would incur sentence of excommunication, and that anyone who read or kept books forbidden on other grounds would be subject to severe punishment. He concluded by making an appeal to the members of the Institute to alter their resolution, stating that otherwise, no Catholic would continue to belong to it.

The Institute did not rescind the resolution. In 1865, several members of the Institute, including Joseph Guibord, appealed to Rome against this pastoral, but received no answer.

On July 7, 1869, Rome added the institute&#x27;s &quot;Annuaire&quot; for the year 1868 to the Catholic Church&#x27;s Index of prohibited books. Bishop Bourget published another pastoral letter, drawing attention to this decision and pointing out the Church had decreed that no Catholic was to belong to the Institute while it taught pernicious doctrines, nor to keep, publish or read the 1868 Annuaire. He stated that any person who persisted in keeping or reading the Annuaire, or in belonging to the Institute, would be deprived of the sacrament, &quot;même à l&#x27;article de la mort.&quot;

In response, the members of the Institute on 23 September 1869 passed a resolution declaring that it did not teach any pernicious doctrine, and that the members of the Institute, having learnt of the condemnation of the 1868 Annuaire, declared that they would submit purely and simply to this decree. Bishop Bourget responded in a letter condemning these resolutions as hypocritical, stating that the Institute had simultaneously passed a secret resolution in favour of religious tolerance, and stating that there would be no absolution for those who remained members of the Institute.

==The Guibord Case==

One of the founding members of the Institute was a printer and typographer named Joseph Guibord. In 1869, Guibord died. Bourget refused to let Henrietta Brown, Guibord&#x27;s widow, bury her husband&#x27;s remains in the Catholic section of the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery because he was a member of the Institute. The widow did not accept the decision and decided to bring the case to court. Henrietta Brown&#x27;s lawyer, Joseph Doutre, also a member of the Institute, ultimately won his case before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the British Empire, including Canada, on November 21, 1874. The Guibord case became a point of great political and religious controversy.

==Closure of the Institute==

The &quot;Institut canadien&quot; of Montreal closed the doors of its debating room in 1871, and the library closed in 1880. Only the &quot;Institut canadien de Québec&quot;, founded four years after that of Montreal, survived the Church&#x27;s censorship by getting rid of certain works prohibited by the Roman Catholic Church.

In 2006, the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ) concluded a deal with the Fraser-Hickson Institute on the donation and transfer of property of the collection of the Institut canadien de Montréal. The latter had preserved it since 1885. Among the precious books of the collection were two editions of the &quot;Œuvres complètes de Voltaire&quot; (1785–1789), 36 volumes of &quot;L&#x27;Encyclopédie&quot; by Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert (1778–1781), 12 volumes of &quot;L&#x27;Esprit des journaux français et étrangers&quot; (1787–1792) and four volumes of &quot;Réunion des Tuileries au Louvre&quot; (1852–1857), a particular gift of Prince Napoléon to the Institut canadien.

<text>A broker is a person or entity that arranges transactions between a buyer and a seller. This may be done for a commission when the deal is executed. A broker who also acts as a seller or as a buyer becomes a principal party to the deal. Neither role should be confused with that of an agent—one who acts on behalf of a principal party in a deal.

==Definition==
A broker is an independent party whose services are used extensively in some industries. A broker&#x27;s prime responsibility is to bring sellers and buyers together and thus a broker is the third-person facilitator between a buyer and a seller. An example would be a real estate broker who facilitates the sale of a property.

Brokers can furnish market research and market data. Brokers may represent either the seller or the buyer but generally not both at the same time. Brokers are expected to have the tools and resources to reach the largest possible base of buyers and sellers. They then screen these potential buyers or sellers for the perfect match. An individual producer, on the other hand, especially one new in the market, probably will not have the same access to customers as a broker. Another benefit of using a broker is cost—they might be cheaper in smaller markets, with smaller accounts, or with a limited line of products.

Some brokers, known as discount brokers, charge smaller commission, sometimes in exchange for offering less advice or services than full service brokerage firms.

A broker-dealer is a broker that transacts for its own account, in addition to facilitating transactions for clients.

Brokerage firms are generally subject to regulations based on the type of brokerage and jurisdictions in which they operate. Examples of brokerage firm regulatory agencies include the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which regulate stockbrokers in the United States.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;broker&quot; derives from Old French &quot;broceur&quot; &quot;small trader&quot;, of uncertain origin, but possibly from Old French &quot;brocheor&quot; meaning &quot;wine retailer&quot;, which comes from the verb &quot;brochier&quot;, or &quot;to broach (a keg)&quot;.

<text>The booted warbler (Iduna caligata) is an Old World warbler in the tree warbler group. It was formerly considered to be conspecific with Sykes&#x27;s warbler, but the two are now usually both afforded species status. Booted warbler itself breeds from central Russia to western China, and migrates to winter in the Indian subcontinent as far south as Sri Lanka. Booted warbler has expanded its breeding range westward in recent decades and nests now as far west and north as Finland.
It is a small passerine bird, found in open country with bushes and other tall vegetation. Three or four eggs are laid in a nest in a bush or vegetation. Like most warblers they are insectivorous.

These are small warblers, especially compared to others in their genus. They are pale brown above and whitish below with buff flanks. The outer tail feathers have pale edges. They have a short pale supercilium, and the bill is strong and pointed. Sykes&#x27;s warbler is larger and greyer than the booted warbler, and most resembles an eastern olivaceous warbler.

Keyserling and Blasius gave no explanation of the genus name &quot;Iduna&quot;, though in Norse mythology Iðunn, or Iduna, is the goddess of spring and fertility who was changed into a sparrow (or a nut) to enable her rescue by Loki. The specific &quot;caligata&quot; is Latin for &quot;booted&quot; from &quot;caliga&quot;, &quot;boot&quot;.

<doc id="397134" wikidata="Q2164044" url="?curid=397134" title="YIQ">
<text>YIQ is the color space used by the analog NTSC color TV system. &quot;I&quot; stands for &quot;in-phase&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot; stands for &quot;quadrature&quot;, referring to the components used in quadrature amplitude modulation. Other TV systems used different color spaces, such as YUV for PAL or YDbDr for SECAM. Later digital standards use the YCbCr color space. These color spaces are all broadly related, and work based on the principle of adding a color component named &quot;chrominance&quot;, to a black and white image named &quot;luma&quot;.

In YIQ the Y component represents the luma information, and is the only component used by black-and-white television receivers. I and Q represent the chrominance information, with I indicating (roughly) orange-blue contrast, and Q indicating purple-green contrast. I and Q can be thought of as a second pair of axes on the same graph as the YUV color space, rotated 33°; therefore IQ and UV represent different coordinate systems on the same plane.

The YIQ system is intended to take advantage of human color-response characteristics. The eye is more sensitive to changes in the orange-blue (I) range than in the purple-green range (Q)—therefore less bandwidth is required for Q than for I. Broadcast NTSC limits I to 1.3 MHz and Q to 0.4 MHz. I and Q are frequency interleaved into the 4 MHz Y signal, which keeps the bandwidth of the overall signal down to 4.2 MHz. In YUV systems, since U and V both contain information in the orange-blue range, both components must be given the same amount of bandwidth as I to achieve similar color fidelity.

Very few television sets perform true I and Q decoding, due to the high costs of such an implementation. Compared to the cheaper R-Y and B-Y decoding which requires only one filter, I and Q each requires a different filter to satisfy the bandwidth differences between I and Q. These bandwidth differences also require that the &#x27;I&#x27; filter include a time delay to match the longer delay of the &#x27;Q&#x27; filter. The Rockwell Modular Digital Radio (MDR) was one I and Q decoding set, which in 1997 could operate in frame-at-a-time mode with a PC or in realtime with the Fast IQ Processor (FIQP). Some RCA &quot;Colortrak&quot; home TV receivers made circa 1985 not only used I/Q decoding, but also advertised its benefits along with its comb filtering benefits as full &quot;100 percent processing&quot; to deliver more of the original color picture content. Earlier, more than one brand of color TV (RCA, Arvin) used I/Q decoding in the 1954 or 1955 model year on models utilizing screens about 13 inches (measured diagonally). The original Advent projection television used I/Q decoding. Around 1990, at least one manufacturer (Ikegami) of professional studio picture monitors advertised I/Q decoding.

== Image processing ==
The YIQ representation is sometimes employed in color image processing transformations. For example, applying a histogram equalization directly to the channels in an RGB image would alter the color balance of the image. Instead, the histogram equalization is applied to the Y channel of the YIQ or YUV representation of the image, which only normalizes the brightness levels of the image.

== Formulas ==
These formulas allow conversion between YIQ and RGB color spaces, where R, G, and B are gamma-corrected values. Values for the original 1953 NTSC colorimetry and later SMPTE C FCC standard.

The following formulas assume:

:formula_1

The ranges for I and Q are a result of the coefficients in the 2nd and 3rd rows of the RGB-to-YIQ equation matrix below, respectively.

=== NTSC 1953 colorimetry ===
These formulas approximate the conversion between the original 1953 color NTSC specification and YIQ.

==== From RGB to YIQ ====
:formula_2 

==== From YIQ to RGB ====
:formula_3

Note that the top row is identical to that of the YUV color space

* formula_4

=== FCC NTSC Standard (SMPTE C)===
In 1987, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) Committee on Television Technology, Working Group on Studio Monitor Colorimetry, adopted the SMPTE C.
The previous conversion formulas were deprecated, and the NTSC standard contained in the FCC rules for over-the-air analog color TV broadcasting adopted a different matrix:

==== From RGB to YIQ ====
:::formula_5

in matrix notation, that equation system is written as:
:formula_6

Where:

* formula_7 is the gamma-corrected voltage of luma.
* formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 are the gamma-corrected voltages corresponding to red, green, and blue signals.
* formula_11 and formula_12 are the amplitudes of the orthogonal components of the chrominance signal.

==== From YIQ to RGB ====
To convert from FCC YIQ to RGB:
:::formula_13

in matrix notation, that equation system is written as:
:formula_14
Where:
* formula_7 is the gamma-corrected voltage of luma.
* formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 are the gamma-corrected voltages corresponding to red, green, and blue signals.
* formula_11 and formula_12 are the amplitudes of the orthogonal components of the chrominance signal.

==== From YUV to YIQ and vice versa ====
formula_21

Due to orthogonal symmetry (symmetry is not required or enough) of the matrix the same matrix can be used for YIQ to YUV conversion.

== Phase-out ==

Most NTSC territories have switched over to digital television. For broadcasting in the United States, NTSC (and with it, YIQ) remained in use only for low-power television stations , well after full-power analog transmissions was ended by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on June 12, 2009, however these were also required to be shut down by the FCC on July 13, 2021, thereby ending the use of NTSC (and YIQ for that matter) completely in that region.

<doc id="397135" wikidata="Q370354" url="?curid=397135" title="Sykes's warbler">
<text>Sykes&#x27;s warbler (Iduna rama) is an Old World warbler in the tree warbler family. It was formerly considered a subspecies of the booted warbler, but is now considered a full species. Its breeding range is from northeast Arabia to Turkestan, west China and Afghanistan. Like the booted warbler, many populations of the species migrate in winter to the Indian subcontinent as far south as Sri Lanka.

==Etymology==

The English name commemorates the Colonel William Henry Sykes who served in the British military in India. Keyserling and Blasius gave no explanation of the genus name &quot;Iduna&quot;, though in Norse mythology Iðunn, or Iduna, is the goddess of spring and fertility who was changed into a sparrow to enable her rescue by Loki. The specific epithet &quot;rama&quot; refers to the Hindu god Rama, an incarnation of Vishnu.

==Taxonomy==
Molecular phylogeny studies in 2009 suggested a clade sister to &quot;Chloropeta&quot; and separate from &quot;Hippolais&quot; in the strict sense resulting in the removal of this species from the genus &quot;Hippolais&quot; and placement in a resurrected older genus name of &quot;Iduna&quot;. There are differences in the nesting and egg morphology between &quot;rama&quot; and &quot;caligata&quot;. 
==Habitat==

It is a small passerine found in open country with bushes and other tall vegetation. Three or four eggs are laid in a nest in a bush or vegetation. Like most warblers they are insectivorous.

==Description==
It is a small warbler, especially compared to others in their genus. They are pale brown above and whitish below with buff flanks. The outer tail feathers have pale edges. They have a short pale supercilium, and the bill is strong and pointed. Sykes&#x27;s warbler is larger and greyer than the booted warbler, and most resembles an eastern olivaceous warbler.

<doc id="397142" wikidata="Q155705" url="?curid=397142" title="Détente">
<text>Détente ( , ; , ) is the relaxation of strained relations, especially political ones, through verbal communication. The diplomacy term originates from around 1912, when France and Germany tried unsuccessfully to reduce tensions.

The term is often used to refer to a period of general easing of geopolitical tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. &quot;Détente&quot; began in 1969 as a core element of the foreign policy of U.S. president Richard Nixon. In an effort to avoid an escalation of conflict with the Eastern Bloc, the Nixon administration promoted greater dialogue with the Soviet government in order to facilitate negotiations over arms control and other bilateral agreements. &quot;Détente&quot; was known in Russian as (), loosely meaning &quot;relaxation of tension&quot;.

==History==
===Cold War===

While the recognized era of &quot;détente&quot; formally began under the Richard Nixon presidency, there were prior instances of relationship relaxation between the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, both the United States and Soviet Union agreed to install a direct hotline between Washington and Moscow, colloquially known as the red telephone. The hotline enabled leaders of both countries to communicate rapidly in the event of another potentially catastrophic confrontation.

The period of &quot;détente&quot; in the Cold War saw the ratification of major disarmament treaties such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the creation of more symbolic pacts such as the Helsinki Accords. An ongoing debate among historians exists as to how successful the &quot;détente&quot; period was in achieving peace.

&quot;Détente&quot; is considered to have ended after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, which led to the U.S.&#x27; boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Ronald Reagan&#x27;s election as president in 1980, based in large part on an anti-&quot;détente&quot; campaign, induced a period of rising tension. In his first press conference, Reagan claimed that the U.S.&#x27;s pursuit of &quot;détente&quot; had been used by the Soviet Union to further its interests.

Relations had been continued to increasingly sour through the unrest in Poland, the U.S.&#x27;s withdrawal from the SALT II arms treaty, and the NATO Able Archer exercise.

In response to the heightening tensions, U.S. secretary of state George P. Shultz shifted the Ronald Reagan administration&#x27;s foreign policy towards another period of de-escalation with the Soviet Union especially following Mikhail Gorbachev coming to power. During Gorbachev&#x27;s leadership, dialogue over the START arms reduction treaty meaningfully progressed. Diplomatic overtures were continued by the succeeding Bush administration, including the ratification of the START treaty, up until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. This period of a renewed de-escalation from 1983 to 1991 is sometimes referred to as the second period of &quot;détente&quot;.

According to Eric Grynaviski, &quot;Soviet and U.S. decision-makers had two very different understandings about what &quot;détente&quot; meant&quot; while simultaneously holding &quot;an inaccurate belief that both sides shared principles and expectations for future behaviour.&quot;

====Summits and treaties====

Before Richard Nixon became president, the foundations of &quot;détente&quot; were developed through multilateral arms-limitation treaties in the early to middle 1960s. These included the August 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the January 1967 Outer Space Treaty, and the July 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Historical developments such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and technological advancements such as the development of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) spurred these agreements.

When Nixon came into office in 1969, several important &quot;détente&quot; treaties were developed. The Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Pact sent an offer to the U.S. and the rest of the West that urged a summit on &quot;security and cooperation in Europe&quot; to be held. The West agreed, and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks began towards actual limits on the nuclear capabilities of both superpowers, which ultimately led to the signing of the SALT I treaty in 1972. It limited each power&#x27;s nuclear arsenals but was quickly rendered outdated as a result of the development of MIRVs. Also in 1972, the Biological Weapons Convention and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty were concluded, and talks on SALT II began the same year. The Washington Summit of 1973 further advanced mutual and international relations through discussion of diplomatic cooperation and continued discussion regarding limitations on nuclear weaponry.

In 1975, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) met and produced the Helsinki Accords, a wide-ranging series of agreements on economic, political, and human rights issues. The CSCE was initiated by the Soviet Union and involved 35 states throughout Europe. One of the most prevalent issues after the conference was the question of human rights violations in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Constitution directly violated the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, and that issue became a prominent point of separation between the United States and the Soviet Union.

The Jimmy Carter administration had been supporting human rights groups inside the Soviet Union, and Leonid Brezhnev accused the US of interference in other countries&#x27; internal affairs. That prompted intense discussion of whether or not other nations may interfere if basic human rights, such as freedom of speech and religion, are violated. This basic disagreement between the superpowers, a democracy, and a one-party state, did not allow that issue to be reconciled. Furthermore, the Soviets proceeded to defend their internal policies on human rights by attacking American support of South Africa, Chile, and other countries that were known to violate many of the same human rights.

In July 1975, the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) became the first international space mission; three American astronauts and two Soviet cosmonauts docked their spacecraft and conducted joint experiments. The mission had been preceded by five years of political negotiation and technical co-operation, including exchanges of American and Soviet engineers between both countries&#x27; space centres.

Trade relations between both blocs increased substantially during the era of &quot;détente&quot;. Most significant were the vast shipments of grain that were sent from the West to the Soviet Union each year and helped to make up for the failure of the kolkhoz, the Soviet collective farms.

At the same time, the Jackson–Vanik amendment, signed into law by U.S. president Gerald Ford on 3 January 1975 after a unanimous vote by both houses of the U.S. Congress, was designed to leverage trade relations between the Americans and the Soviets. It linked U.S. trade to improvements in human rights in the Soviet Union, particularly by allowing refuseniks to emigrate. It also added to the most favoured nation status a clause that no country that resisted emigration could be awarded that status, which provided a method to link geopolitics to human rights.

====End of Vietnam War====
Nixon and his national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, moved toward &quot;détente&quot; with the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. They hoped, in return, for Soviets to help the U.S. extricate or remove itself from Vietnam. People then started to notice the consciousness with which US politicians started to act.

====Strategic Arms Limitations Talks====

Nixon and Brezhnev signed an ABM treaty in Moscow on 26 May 1972 as well as SALT I, the Interim Agreement, which temporarily capped the number of strategic arms (MIRVs, SLBMs, and ICBMs). That was a show of &quot;détente&quot; militarily since an expansion of nuclear ballistic arms had started to occur.

The goal of Nixon and Kissinger was to use arms control to promote a much broader policy of &quot;détente&quot;, which could then allow the resolution of other urgent problems through what Nixon called &quot;linkage.&quot; David Tal argued:
====Apollo–Soyuz handshake====

A significant example of an event contributing to &quot;détente&quot; was the handshake that took place in space. In July 1975, the first Soviet-American joint space flight was conducted, the ASTP. Its primary goal was the creation of an international docking system, which would allow two different spacecraft to join in orbit. That would allow both crews on board to collaborate on space exploration. The project marked the end of the Space Race, which had started in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik 1, and allowed tensions between the Americans and the Soviets to decrease significantly.

====Concurrent conflicts====
As direct relations thawed, increased tensions continued between both superpowers through their proxies, especially in the Third World. Conflicts in South Asia and the Middle East in 1973 saw the Soviet Union and the U.S. backing their respective surrogates, such as in Afghanistan, with war material and diplomatic posturing. In Latin America, the U.S. continued to block any left-wing electoral shifts in the region by supporting unpopular right-wing military coups and military dictatorships. Meanwhile, there were also many communist or left-wing guerrillas around the region, which were militarily and economically backed by the Soviet Union, China and Cuba.

During much of the early &quot;détente&quot; period, the Vietnam War continued to rage. Both sides still mistrusted each other, and the potential for nuclear war remained constant, notably during the 1973 Yom Kippur War when the U.S. raised its alert level to DEFCON 3, the highest since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Both sides continued aiming thousands of nuclear warheads atop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at each other&#x27;s cities, maintaining submarines with long-range nuclear weapon capability (submarine-launched ballistic missiles, or SLBMs) in the world&#x27;s oceans, keeping hundreds of nuclear-armed aircraft on constant alert, and guarding contentious borders in Korea and Europe with large ground forces. Espionage efforts remained a high priority, and defectors, reconnaissance satellites, and signal intercepts measured each other&#x27;s intentions to try to gain a strategic advantage.

====Reignited tensions and the end of the first &quot;détente&quot;====
The 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, carried out in an attempt to shore up a struggling pro-Soviet regime, led to harsh international criticisms, and a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics, held in Moscow. U.S. president Jimmy Carter boosted the budget of the U.S. Department of Defense and began financial aid to the office of Pakistan president Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who, in turn, subsidized the anti-Soviet radical Islamist group of Afghan mujahideen fighters.

Another contributing factor in the decline in the popularity of &quot;détente&quot; as a desirable U.S. policy was the inter-service rivalry between the U.S. State Department and Department of Defense. From 1973 to 1977, there were three secretaries worth mentioning: Elliot Richardson, James Schlesinger, and Donald Rumsfeld. Schlesinger&#x27;s tenure as secretary of defense was plagued by notably poor relations with Kissinger, one of the most prominent advocates of &quot;détente&quot; in the U.S. Their poor working relationship bled into their professional relationship, and policy clashes would increasingly occur. They ultimately resulted in Schlesinger&#x27;s dismissal in 1975. However, his replacement, Rumsfeld, had similar issues with Kissinger although their disagreements stemmed more from domestic resistance to &quot;détente&quot;. As a result, clashes on policy continued between the State and the Defense Departments. Rumsfeld thought that Kissinger was too complacent about the growing Soviet strength. Although Rumsfeld largely agreed with Kissinger&#x27;s stance that the U.S. held military superiority over the Soviet Union, he argued that Kissinger&#x27;s public optimism would prevent Congress from allowing the Defense Department the funds that Rumsfeld believed were required to maintain the favorable gap between the US and the Soviets. Rumsfeld responded by regularly presenting a more alarmist view of the superior strength of the Soviets.

In response to the stranglehold of influence by Kissinger in the Nixon and Ford administrations and the later decline in influence over foreign policy by the Department of Defense, Richardson, Schlesinger, and Rumsfeld all used the growing antipathy in the U.S. for the Soviet Union to undermine Kissinger&#x27;s attempts to achieve a comprehensive arms reduction treaty. That helped to portray the entire notion of &quot;détente&quot; as an untenable policy.

The 1980 U.S. presidential election saw Reagan elected on a platform opposed to the concessions of &quot;détente&quot;. Negotiations on SALT II were abandoned as a result. However, during the later years of his presidency, Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev pursued a policy that was considered to be &quot;détente&quot;. However, the Reagan administration talked about a &quot;winnable&quot; nuclear war and led to the creation of the Strategic Defense Initiative and the Third World policy of funding irregular and paramilitary death squads in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa, Cambodia, and Afghanistan.

==Cuban thaw==

On 17 December 2014, U.S. president Barack Obama and Cuba president Raúl Castro resolved to restore diplomatic relations between Cuba and the U.S. The restoration agreement had been negotiated in secret in the preceding months. The negotiations were facilitated by Pope Francis and hosted mostly by the Canadian government, which had warmer relations with Cuba at that time. Meetings were held in both Canada and the Vatican City. The agreement would see some U.S. travel restrictions lifted, fewer restrictions on remittances, greater access to the Cuban financial system for U.S. banks, and the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Havana and the Cuban embassy in Washington, which both closed in 1961 after the breakup of diplomatic relations as a result of Cuba&#x27;s alliance with the Soviet Union.

On 14 April 2015, the Obama administration announced the removal of Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Cuba was officially removed from the list on 29 May 2015. On 20 July 2015, the Cuban and U.S. interest sections in Washington and Havana were upgraded to embassies. On 20 March 2016, Obama became the first U.S. president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge visited in 1928. In 2017, Donald Trump, Obama&#x27;s successor, stated that he was &quot;canceling&quot; the Obama administration&#x27;s deals with Cuba, while also expressing that a new deal could be negotiated between the Cuban and U.S. governments.

<doc id="397147" wikidata="Q251499" url="?curid=397147" title="Rolando Navarrete">
<text>Rolando Navarrete (born February 14, 1957) is a Filipino former professional boxer who competed from 1973 to 1991. He held the WBC super featherweight title from August 1981 and May 1982.

==Fighting style==
A fine boxer, Navarrete had a good talent and was known for his hard-hitting punches.
Known to be a slugger and one of the greatest Filipino knockout artists.

==Professional career==
He first fought for a world title in 1980 against Alexis Argüello but lost by TKO to the legendary champion. On August 29, 1981, he would win the WBC Super featherweight title by knocking out popular fellow southpaw Cornelius Boza-Edwards in the 5th round of a title match held in Italy. He later defended the title against unknown Choi Chung-Il of Korea, stopping the gritty challenger in the 11th round of a controversial bout held in Manila in January 1982. In his second title defense four months later in Las Vegas, Nevada, Navarrete took on Rafael &quot;Bazooka&quot; Limón. The champion led on all scorecards before getting knocked out by Limón in the 12th round. Thereafter, Navarrete&#x27;s career went downhill and he would never again figure in big-money fights. In 1984, he was convicted of sexual assault and served three years in a Hawaiian prison.

After his release in March 1988, Navarrete went back to the Philippines and embarked on several comeback fights. In one of those fights, he would exact revenge on his old tormentor Limón, winning by decision in a 10-round bout. During his comeback, he was cast alongside fellow boxer Rolando Bohol by comic book writer Carlo J. Caparas in his boxing film &quot;Kambal Na Kamao: Madugong Engkwentro&quot;, which was released in mid-1988. A series of losses against local fighters and unranked contenders later forced him to retire for good.

==Personal life==
Navarrete currently lives in General Santos. A series of failed relationships with different women gave him a total of seven children. One of his sons, Rolando Jr., who fights under his mother&#x27;s name Rolando Dy, is a professional mixed martial artist.

Troubles outside the ring left Navarrete with no money and the former world champion now sells fish that, according to him, earn him 800 pesos (about 16 dollars) a day. He still trains nowadays with a heavy bag in his home.

He spent three years in a United States prison for rape. Navarrete was also recently involved in various police complaints for wife battery and drugs.

On February 14, 2008, Navarrete, was pronounced out of danger, after being stabbed in the neck by Racman Saliling, a tenant at the boarding house he owns in Bula, General Santos, using an ice pick. Navarrete was also involved in two previous attacks: in 2005, he was hit with a steel pipe by a female neighbor and in 2006, a security guard clubbed his leg with a shotgun at a fishing port.

==Legacy==
He is ranked the 9th best super featherweight champion in history, by the World Boxing Council. In 2007, Navarrete was included in &quot;Kamao&quot;, an episode of award winning program Sine Totoo, which received the RP&#x27;s first and only George Foster Peabody Award, the equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize.

&quot;Kamao&quot;, presented the sports of boxing and featured the story of the former world featherweight champion.

<doc id="397152" wikidata="Q654544" url="?curid=397152" title="Sudd">
<text>The Sudd (, Nuer: Baki̱ec, Dinka: Toc) is a vast swamp in South Sudan, formed by the White Nile&#x27;s &quot;Baḥr al-Jabal&quot; section. The Arabic word &#x27; is derived from&#x27; (), meaning &quot;barrier&quot; or &quot;obstruction&quot;. The term &quot;the sudd&quot; has come to refer to any large solid floating vegetation island or mat. The area which the swamp covers is one of the world&#x27;s largest wetlands and the largest freshwater wetland in the Nile Basin.

For many centuries the swamp, and especially its thicket of vegetation, proved an impenetrable barrier to navigation along the Nile. The ancient Egyptians failed to penetrate the Sudd and reach the areas south of it. In AD 61, a party of Roman soldiers sent by the Emperor Nero proceeded up the White Nile but were not able to get beyond the Sudd, which marked the limit of Roman penetration into equatorial Africa. For the same reasons in later times, the search for the source of the Nile was particularly difficult; it eventually involved overland expeditions from the central African coast, so as to avoid having to travel through the Sudd.

In 2019, a study suggested that increased water flows into the Sudd may be partly causing up to a third of the whole West African rise in atmospheric methane levels over the previous decade.

==Location==
The Sudd stretches from Mongalla to just outside the Sobat River confluence with the White Nile just upstream of Malakal as well as westwards along the Bahr el Ghazal. The shallow and flat inland delta lies between 5.5 and 9.5 degrees latitude north and covers an area of south to north and east to west between Mongalla in the south and Malakal in the north.

Its size is highly variable, averaging over . During the wet season it may extend to over comprising 21% of the country, depending on the inflowing waters, with the discharge from Lake Victoria being the main control factor of flood levels and area inundation. Since the Sudd area consists of various meandering channels, lagoons, reed and papyrus fields and loses half of its inflowing water through evapotranspiration in the permanent and seasonal floodplains, the complex hydrology has many primary and secondary effects. A major feature of the area, is the incomplete Jonglei Canal, which was planned to bypass waters from the Sudd to avoid evaporation losses and increase the amount of water discharged at the outlet of the Sudd.

From 1961 to 1963, a great increase in the flooded area occurred when the level of Lake Victoria rose, and the outflow increased. The total area of the Sudd is related to the amount of water reaching Bor from the Albert Nile and from torrents or seasonal watercourses that can add substantial amounts to the flow in the upstream end of the Sudd. During the 1960s increase in Lake Victoria discharge, where flows at Mongalla roughly doubled, the flows at Malakal at the northern end of the swamps increased by 1.5 times the previous average flow. As a consequence of these high flows, the areas of permanent swamp and seasonal floodplains have, taken together, increased to 2.5 times their former size. The swamps have increased the most, and the seasonal floodplain is 1.5 times its previous size.

From the southern inflow of the Bahr al Jabal (&quot;Sea of the Mountain&quot;) at Mongalla, the defined riverbed successively widens into a floodplain, where the waters flow in meandering river stretches and various channels and lagoons throughout the dry season. With rising water levels it expands over the semi-flooded grasslands during the flood season.

Slightly downstream of Bor, the Bahr el Zeraf (&quot;Sea of the Giraffes&quot;) river branches off the Bahr al Jabal to the east, diverting part of the flow, and again joins the Bahr al Jabal just before reaching Malakal. During the course of its flow, the Bahr al Jabal passes Lake No, where the Bahr el Ghazal (&quot;Sea of the Gazelles&quot;) connects to the Bahr al Jabal, contributing an inflow with seasonal variation. At Malakal, the Sobat River joins into the system. The combined flows then stream to the north as the White Nile in a defined bed, joining with the Blue Nile waters at Khartoum to form the main Nile.

Sudd was designated as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2006. An area of was designated.

==Climate==
Hydrologically the Sudd plays an important role in storing floodwaters and trapping sediments from the Bahr al Jabal. Roughly 55% of water entering the area is lost to evaporation. Water levels fluctuate by up to 1.5 metres, depending on the intensity of seasonal flooding. The region receives less rainfall (typically between 55 and 65 centimetres per year) than neighbouring areas at the same latitude. Orographic lifting on the eastern and western sides of the Sudd contribute to that condition.

==Geomorphology==
The morphology of the area is defined by the channel and lagoon system of the permanent Sudd swamps, the adjacent flood plains, and the surrounding flat terrain. The Bahr al Jabal runs to the north-northwest and therefore in an angle to the gradient of the floodplain, which slopes down to the north, while north of Juba the river flows in an incised trough. The banks of this trough decrease in height from south to north with the Bahr al Jabal approaching Bor and ending in the Sudd flood plain just north of Bor on the eastern bank and towards Shambe on the western bank. In the southern part, the river meanders from side to side in the restraining trough in one or more channels, but further north the swamp is not limited by higher ground and the system of river channels becomes increasingly complex. The characteristics of the river with its network of channels and lagoons are distinguishable in satellite imagery and digital elevation models.

The geology of the area is defined by heavy clay soils, highly impermeable with a top layer of &quot;black cotton&quot; vertisol of approximately 500 mm on average. Sandy soils are found only at depths of approximately and below, as determined by well drilling profiles. This indicates a very limited groundwater influence on the area&#x27;s hydrology.

==Population==

Nuer and Dinka pastoralists use the Sudd and the surrounding areas extensively. Livestock and rain-fed agriculture are the dominant means of support for the largely rural population for which the seasonal flooded grasslands along the Sudd provides valuable grazing lands.

==Vegetation and ecosystem==
Vegetation cover of the area can generally be classified in five categories which depend on the elevation of the area above river flood level: the lakes and rivers, the floating plant life of the swamp, river-flooded grasslands (Toic), rain-flooded grasslands, and wooded grasslands on the fringes. Grassland and woodland areas have been cultivated by local populations.

The density of the grasslands along the Sudd changes with the season, with tall grass in the rainy season and short dry grass in the dry season, when frequent fires also occur. The fluvial area is mostly overgrown with vegetation, with some main and side channels as well as lagoons of open water. The vegetation distribution is described in further detail in Sutcliffe (1974) and Petersen (2007). The main species are:

* &quot;Phragmites communis&quot; (shallow flooded, buried roots)
* &quot;Echinochloa pyramidalis&quot; (shallow flooded, buried roots)
* &quot;Oryza barthii&quot; (shallow flooded, buried roots)
* &quot;Echinochloa stagnina&quot; (deep flooded, superficial/floating roots)
* &quot;Vossia cuspidata&quot; (deep flooded, superficial/floating roots)
* &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot; (deep flooded, superficial/floating roots)
* &quot;Typha domingensis&quot;

The first three species are anchored so their distribution is limited to the depth of flooding. For the last species their root system needs to be permanently in water or saturated soil, which is a good indicator of flood patterns. &quot;P. communis&quot;, &quot;E. pyramidalis&quot; and &quot;O. barthii&quot; for example dominate only in areas where the depth of flooding does not exceed 130 cm over a period of ten years or 118 cm for one month in the year.

Floating vegetation of &quot;C. papyrus&quot; had caused blockages in the Sudd swamps on a number of occasions between 1879 and 1900, when the plants were torn out by increased flooding. &quot;C. papyrus&quot; needs saturated conditions and can tolerate flooding that is not more than 150 cm deep.

When the matted vegetation breaks free of its moorings, it forms floating islands of vegetation up to 30 km in length. Such islands, in varying stages of decomposition, eventually break up.

Historically, the fully floating Nile cabbage (&quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot;) was an important plant in the Sudd, but it has largely been replaced by the invasive water hyacinth (&quot;Eichhornia crassipes&quot;). The sluggish waters are host to a large population of mosquitoes and parasites that cause waterborne diseases.

===Fauna===
Including several diverse aquatic habitats like swamps, lakes, channels and floodplains, the Sudd is rich in fish. Some 70 species have been recorded, and this mostly involves fish that are found in much of the Nile system such as marbled lungfish, Senegal bichir, African arowana, &quot;Mormyrus caschive&quot;, Nile carp, Nile tilapia, mango tilapia, redbelly tilapia, Nile perch, &quot;Distichodus rostratus&quot;, elongate tigerfish, African tetras, African sharptooth catfish, &quot;Synodontis frontosus&quot;, &quot;S. schall&quot; and others. Among the few endemics of the Sudd system are &quot;Clarias engelseni&quot;, &quot;Enteromius yeiensis&quot;, &quot;Nothobranchius nubaensis&quot;, &quot;N. virgatus&quot; and two apparently undescribed species of &quot;Enteromius&quot;, and the fish fauna in significant sections still has not been properly studied.

Over 400 species of bird are found in the Sudd, including shoebills (a stronghold for the species with several thousand individuals), great white pelicans, and black crowned cranes. The Sudd provides food and water to large populations of migrating birds. As the surrounding landscape is a large swath of dry Sahel across Africa, the swamp is also a haven for migrating mammals, especially antelopes, such as the bohor reedbuck, sitatunga (the most aquatic antelope of the Sudd, mostly inhabiting permanent swampland), the endangered Nile lechwe (not in permanent swampland, but generally near the water&#x27;s edge and often walking in shallow water), and the white-eared kob (further away from the permanent swampland). White-eared kob, tiang and Mongalla gazelle take part in one of the largest mammal migrations on Earth, numbering about 1.2 million individuals in total. The shallow water is frequented by Nile crocodiles and hippopotamuses. In more upland areas the Sudd was known as an historic habitat for the endangered painted hunting dog, which however may have been exterminated in the region.

==Threats and preservation==
The long-running civil war in Southern Sudan seriously disrupted conservation efforts in the Sudd, especially as the widespread availability of weapons has encouraged wildlife poaching, including of elephants. There are three game reserves: Zeraf Island between the Zeraf River and the Nile, Shambe Reserve, and Mongalla Game Reserve.

==Jonglei diversion canal==

The early explorers searching for the source of the Nile experienced considerable difficulties, sometimes taking months to get through the Sudd. In his 1972 book &quot;The White Nile&quot;, Alan Moorehead says of the Sudd, &quot;there is no more formidable swamp in the world&quot;. The Sudd swamp is sustained by the water from the southwestern tributaries (the Bahr el Ghazal system) and consumes a proportion of the main river through evaporation and transpiration.

Sir William Garstin, Undersecretary of State of Public Works of Egypt, created the first detailed proposal for digging a canal east of the Sudd in 1907. By bypassing the swamps, evaporation of the Nile&#x27;s water would vastly decrease, allowing an increase in the area of cultivatable land in Egypt by . The Egyptian government in the 1930s proposed digging a canal east of the Sudd to divert water from the Bahr al Jabal above the Sudd to a point farther down the White Nile, bypassing the swamps and carrying the White Nile&#x27;s water directly to the main channel of the river.

The Jonglei Canal scheme was studied by the government of Egypt in 1946, and plans were developed in 1954–59. Construction work on the canal began in 1978, but the outbreak of political instability in Sudan has held up work for many years. By 1984 when the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army brought the works to a halt, 240 km of the canal of a total of 360 km had been excavated. The rusting remains of the giant German-built excavation machine—variously nicknamed either &quot;Sarah&quot; or &quot;Lucy&quot;—are visible on a Google Earth image at the south end of the canal, where it has been located since it was destroyed by a missile. When peace was restored in 2000, speculation grew about a restart of the project. However, on 21 February 2008, the Sudanese government said the revival of the project was not a priority. Nevertheless, in 2008, Sudan and Egypt agreed to restart the project and finish the canal in 24 years. South Sudan gained independence in 2011.

It is estimated that the Jonglei canal project would produce 3.5–4.8 x 109 m3 of water per year (equal to a mean annual discharge of 110–152 m3/s (3 883–5 368 ft3/s), an increase of around 5–7% of Egypt&#x27;s current water supply. The canal&#x27;s benefits would be shared by Egypt and Sudan, with the expected damage falling on South Sudan. The complex environmental and social issues involved, including the collapse of fisheries, drying of grazing lands, a drop of groundwater levels, and a reduction of rainfall in the region, limits the practicality of the project. The draining of the Sudd is likely to have environmental effects comparable to the drying of Lake Chad or the draining of the Aral Sea.

<text>Bloodscream (originally Bloodsport) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of Wolverine.

==Publication history==
Bloodscream first appeared in &quot;Wolverine&quot; vol. 2 #4 (February 1989), and was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Buscema.

==Fictional character biography==
Bloodscream was originally a naval surgeon who served in Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s pirate fleet between 1577 and 1580. After being mortally wounded in an attack on a Spanish galleon, he is treated by the Native American necromancer Dagoo, who transforms him into a vampire-like being.

Learning that his condition can only be reversed by the blood of an immortal, Bloodscream travels the world in search of one, fighting in any war he can. In the process, he becomes a mercenary, ally of Hydra, and enemy of Wolverine.

Bloodscream later appeared as a member of the Nightstalkers where they attacked the vampires residing on North Brother Island. He also reanimated and controlled Frank Drake&#x27;s corpse to assist them. When the Avengers Emergency Response Division fought the Nightstalkers, Frank Drake was freed from Bloodscream&#x27;s control and assisted in defeating the Nightstalkers. Bloodscream and the rest of the Nightstalkers were left for the vampire sheriffs to stand trial in the vampire nation of Vampyrsk.

==Powers and abilities==
Bloodscream is a vampire-like being who possesses the abilities of vampires without any of their weaknesses. He possesses superhuman physical traits, is funcitionally immortal, and can drain the life forces of other and revive corpses as mindless, zombie-like beings under his control.

Bloodscream can also transform into a monstrous form with elongated claws and teeth, but reduced intelligence.

Bloodscream is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and has many connections throughout the criminal underworld, adding to his reputation as a mercenary for hire. His extended lifespan has granted him great experience in matters of naval warfare and piracy.

==In other media==
===Television===
Bloodscream makes a cameo appearance in the &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot;.

===Video games===
Bloodscream appears as a boss in &quot;&quot;.

<text>Nordhausen () is a city in Thuringia, Germany. It is the capital of the Nordhausen district and the urban centre of northern Thuringia and the southern Harz region; its population is 42,000. Nordhausen is located approximately north of Erfurt, west of Halle, south of Braunschweig and east of Göttingen.

Nordhausen was first mentioned in records in the year 927 and became one of the most important cities in central Germany during the later Middle Ages. The city is situated on the Zorge river, a tributary of the Helme within the fertile region of Goldene Aue &quot;(golden floodplain)&quot; at the southern edge of the Harz mountains. In the early 13th century, it became a free imperial city, so that it was an independent and republican self-ruled member of the Holy Roman Empire. Due to its long-distance trade, Nordhausen was prosperous and influential, with a population of 8,000 around 1500. It was the third-largest city in Thuringia after Erfurt, today&#x27;s capital, and Mühlhausen, the other free imperial city in the land.

Nordhausen was once known for its tobacco industry and is still known for its distilled spirit, &quot;&quot;. Industrialization accompanied railway construction that linked the cities to major markets in the mid-19th century. In the late 19th century, narrow-gauge railways were constructed in this region through the Harz mountains. In December 1898 the Nordhausen-Wernigerode Railway Company (&quot;Nordhausen-Wernigeroder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft&quot;) or NWE added a line, with the full network operating by 1899. The Harz Narrow Gauge Railways are maintained today by local authorities and frequented primarily by tourists.

In the early 20th century, this became a centre of the engineering and arms industries. During World War II, the Nazi German government established and operated the nearby KZ Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, where 60,000 forced labourers had to work in the arms industry. They were prisoners of war and persons from occupied territories. Some 20,000 persons died because of the bad conditions. In April 1945, most of the city was destroyed by Royal Air Force bombings, resulting in 8,800 casualties (more than 20% of the population). 25 % of the historic inner city survived. Nordhausen suffered the most damage during the war of any city in Thuringia. A week later the United States troops occupied the city, followed weeks later by the Soviet Red Army. The city was within the Soviet zone of occupation, and later the territory was known as East Germany. Hundreds of German scientists and their families from Nordhausen were among thousands deported to the Soviet Union after the war to work on advanced rocket and other arms engineering projects.

Nordhausen is the birthplace of the mathematician Oswald Teichmüller, known for his groundbreaking work on the Teichmüller spaces – which were named after him. It is the site of the Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences (&quot;Fachhochschule Nordhausen&quot;), founded in 1997 after the reunification of Germany. The university has 2,500 students.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
The Franks colonized the area around Nordhausen about 800, many place names here have a Frankish origin, discernible by the suffix &quot;-hausen&quot; (like Nordhausen itself, Sundhausen, Windehausen and the later abandoned settlement Stockhausen as well as the neighbouring cities of Mühlhausen, Sondershausen, Frankenhausen and Sangerhausen). Nordhausen itself is first mentioned in a 13 May 927 document of King Henry the Fowler. He built a castle here, which is traceable between 910 and 1277 and became a centre of the empire during the 10th century. Gerberga of Saxony, Henry&#x27;s daughter is supposed to have been born there, as was Henry I, Duke of Bavaria. The first market was established in the 10th century, as was a chapter of nuns (961). During the 12th century, the &quot;old town&quot; was semi-planned and established around the new market place and St. Nicholas&#x27; Church.

Nordhausen was Reichsgut (estate of the German emperor) from the beginning, but in 1158, Frederick Barbarossa donated it to the local chapter of nuns, which was converted to a cathedral chapter by Frederick II in 1220, whereby the city came back to the empire and became an Imperial Free City. Nordhausen was granted the privileges of a town around 1200, in 1198 it was first mentioned as a &quot;villa&quot; and in 1206, there was a mayor, a Vogt and citizens. The municipal law of Nordhausen was similar to that of Mühlhausen, hence the Mühlhausen Book of Law was adopted in the mid-13th century. Today&#x27;s city wall was established between 1290 and 1330 and cut the old town off from &quot;Altendorf&quot; in the north-west, the &quot;new town&quot; in the west and &quot;Altnordhausen&quot; in the south. Nevertheless, the new town was legally incorporated in 1365. Besides the parish churches, many monasteries were founded during the late Middle Ages in Nordhausen (Cistercians in Altnordhausen (Frauenberg, about 1200) and Altendorf (1294), Augustines where the Nordhäuser distillery is today (1312), Franciscans at Georgengasse (1230) and Dominicans at Predigerstraße (1287)). As distinct from Mühlhausen and many other free imperial cities, Nordhausen did not own any territories or villages in the surrounding area.

The city&#x27;s independence was endangered by the ambitions of regional counts, especially by those of Hohnstein County (based in near Ilfeld), who extorted funds from Nordhausen during the 14th century. On the other hand, the debts of the Hohnstein Counts were gigantic: they owed 86 citizens of Nordhausen 5744 Mark silver in 1370. In 1306, Nordhausen allied with the two other major Thuringian cities Erfurt and Mühlhausen against the Wettins and the local counts (Hohnstein, Stolberg, Schwarzburg, Beichlingen etc.) and joined the Hanseatic League together with them in 1430. Further alliances were concluded with Goslar, Halberstadt, Quedlinburg and Aschersleben to represent urban interests against the landlords.

In 1349, during a plague epidemic, some number of Jewish residents were killed by the citizenry with support from Frederick II, Margrave of Meissen. According to legend, they danced on their way to the pyre.

=== Early modern period ===
In 1500 it became part of the Lower Saxon Circle, and from around the same year the city began producing fermented grain liquor, which became famous under the name &quot;Nordhäuser Doppelkorn&quot;. In 1523, a year in which Thomas Müntzer spent some time in the city, the Protestant Reformation came to Nordhausen, which was one of the first cities that adopted the new doctrine. The cathedral chapter stayed catholic, protected by the Habsburg emperors but the other monasteries got closed during the following decades and their heritage came to the city. During the 16th century, Nordhausen succeeded to push back the influence of the Wettins and the Hohnstein counts by buying back their privileges over the city. This marked the peak in pre-modern urban development, followed by some centuries of decline introduced by the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1551, the Jews were expelled from the city. They were not generally permitted to live there again until 1807.

After the war, the Electorate of Brandenburg tried to incorporate the free cities of Nordhausen, Mühlhausen and Goslar, because it already became large territories in the Harz region. The Electorate of Saxony, protecting power of Nordhausen gave hidden support to the Brandenburgs, so that Nordhausen tried to keep its independence through the protection by the Hanovers. After the Brandenburg-Prussians had occupied Nordhausen between 1703 and 1714, the city got protection of Hanover resp. England, which paid 50,000 Talers to the Prussians to leave Nordhausen, which was moreover destroyed by two town fires in 1710 and 1712. Under the protection of Hanover, the economy improved again and the production of tobacco since mid-18th century brought new wealth to Nordhausen.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Prussian troops occupied Nordhausen on 2 August 1802; the city lost its status as an Imperial Free City during the German Mediatisation. After Prussia&#x27;s defeat against Napoleon, it became part of the Kingdom of Westphalia created in 1807.

=== Since 1815 ===
Following the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte, Nordhausen was included in the Kingdom of Prussia&#x27;s Province of Saxony created in 1816. During the mid-19th century, industrialisation started in Nordhausen with production of chewing tobacco, alcoholic beverages, paper and textiles. The breakthrough was reached as Nordhausen got connected to main railways in four directions between 1866 and 1869. In 1882 it became an urban district (until 1950). In the late 19th century, narrow-gauge railways were constructed linking Nordhausen and other cities through the Harz mountains, operating by 1899.

As the engineering industry developed after 1900, the city saw an economic heyday. Industry developed and expanded during the following decades.

=== 1900 to present ===
In the 1930s the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. It imposed discrimination against Jews, with increasing restrictions and violence such as Kristallnacht in 1938, when businesses and synagogues were destroyed. It deported Jews to concentration and death camps. The Mittelbau-Dora Nazi concentration camp, also known as Dora-Nordhausen or Nordhausen, was established in 1943 during World War II after the destruction of Peenemünde, and located on the outskirts of Nordhausen to provide labor for the Mittelwerk V-2 rocket factory in the Kohnstein. Over its period of operation, around 60,000 inmates passed through Dora and its system of subcamps, of whom around 20,000 died from bad working conditions, starvation, and diseases, or were murdered. Around 10,000 forced labourers were deployed in several factories within the city; up to 6,000 of them were interned at Boelcke Kaserne, working for a Junkers factory.

On 24 August 1944, 11 B-17 Flying Fortresses of Mission 568 bombed the airfield at Nordhausen as a target of opportunity. From January 1945, sick and dying prisoners were interned at Boelcke Kaserne. On 3 and 4 April 1945 three-quarters of Nordhausen was destroyed by bombing raids of the Royal Air Force, resulting in the deaths of around 8,800 people, including 1,300-1,500 sick prisoners at the Boelcke Kaserne barracks within Nordhausen.

On 11 April 1945, United States troops occupied the town, and on 2 July the Red Army of the Soviet Union took over. A Special Mission V-2: US operation was undertaken by Maj. William Bromley, intended to recover V-2 rocket parts and equipment. Maj. James P. Hamill co-ordinated the rail transport of said equipment with the 144th Motor Vehicle Assembly Company, from Nordhausen to Erfurt (Operation Paperclip).

On 18 July the Soviet administration created the Institute Rabe to develop Soviet rocket technology on the basis of the substantially more sophisticated V-2 rockets. In May 1946 the Institute was subsumed into the new Institute Nordhausen, under an expanded programme of research across the Soviet occupation zone, including a new Institute Berlin. On 22 October 1946, under Operation Osoaviakhim, 10–15,000 German scientists, engineers and their families were deported to the Soviet Union, including around 300 from Nordhausen. Transplanted along with their equipment, many of the scientists and their families lived there until the early 1950s.

Nordhausen became part of East Germany in 1949. It was administered as part of Bezirk Erfurt from 1952. The reconstruction of Nordhausen took a long time during the 1950s and 1960s and was carried out in modern architectural style. Town hall, the cathedral and St. Blaise&#x27;s Church were the only rebuilt historic monuments. The Uprising of 1953 in East Germany found a centre in Nordhausen, because the living conditions within the destroyed city were still bad, and the people were exceedingly dissatisfied. Only the Soviet army could defeat the uprising. Within the GDR, Nordhausen was the centre of tobacco and liqueur production.

After the German reunification of 1990, Nordhausen was made part of the recreated state of Thuringia. The 1990s brought an economic crisis with high unemployment rates, and many uncompetitive communist-era factories had to close. Nevertheless, local industry revived after the crisis. Since 2000 the economy has been growing again, with the unemployment rate decreasing and Nordhausen has established itself as the urban centre of northern Thuringia. The Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences was founded in 1997, attracting students to the town. The Landesgartenschau (Land&#x27;s horticultural exhibition) in 2004 was an impetus to further urban development.

== Geography and demographics ==
=== Topography ===
Nordhausen is situated at the border between the flat and fertile area of Goldene Aue in the south and the foothills of the Harz mountains in the north on a level of approx. 180 m of elevation. The Zorge river crosses the city from northwest to southeast and the bigger Helme river runs in west-eastern direction at the southern border of the municipality. Between them are some quarry ponds of former gravel mining near the Sundhausen and Bielen districts. To the north, the terrain is getting more hilly and part of a karst area south to the Harz mountains. The north-west of the territory is marked by the Kohnstein hill (335 m) and the north-east is the Rüdigsdorf Switzerland, a small area with a beautiful landscape up to 350 m of elevation around Rüdigsdorf district. South of Helme river, the terrain gets also hilly around the Windleite mountains between Nordhausen and Sondershausen. Most of the municipal territory is in agricultural use. The forests are located first between the city centre in the south and Rüdigsdorf in the north (with interruptions), second at Kohnstein hill and third in the east around Rodishain and Stempeda.

=== Administrative division ===

Nordhausen abuts the following municipalities: Ellrich, Harztor, Harzungen, Neustadt, Buchholz and Herrmannsacker in the north, Südharz and Urbach in the east, Heringen and Kleinfurra in the south and Werther in the west. Except of Südharz, which is part of Mansfeld-Südharz district in Saxony-Anhalt, all the neighbouring municipalities belong to the Nordhausen district in Thuringia.

The following villages belong to the Nordhausen municipality:
=== Demographics ===
Nordhausen had approx. 8,000 inhabitants during the late Middle Ages around 1500, which was the third-largest number within today&#x27;s Thuringia, after Erfurt, the current capital and Mühlhausen. The early modern period brought stagnation to the city, so that the population was also 8,000 around 1800. Nordhausen fell back behind the new ducal residence cities like Weimar, Gotha or Altenburg in this ages and lost its former importance. Nevertheless, Industrialization started in the 1860s, as Nordhausen got connected to the railway and the population grew to 26,000 and 33,000 in 1910, which was a smaller growth than in other cities of comparable size during that period of rapid urbanisation in Germany. Until 1940, the population rose to 42,000, but decreased due to the destruction of the city in World War II to 32,000 in 1946. The old level was attained again in the early 1960s and the population peak was reached in 1988 with 48,000. The bad economic situation after the German reunification led to emigration during the 1990s and the population shrunk in that decade. Because of the various incorporations of neighbouring villages, the amount looks smaller than it was.

The average change of population within the last years (2009–2012) was approximately -0.35% p. a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency and the 2011 EU census led to a statistical amendment of –2,000 persons. Suburbanization played only a small role in Nordhausen. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders.

The birth deficit was 266 in 2012, this is -6.3 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -0.5 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6), but is fluctuating relatively heavy for years. The most important regions of origin of Nordhausen migrants are rural areas of Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.

Like other eastern German cities, Nordhausen has only a small number of foreigners: circa 2.3% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 4.6% are migrants (according to 2011 EU census). During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved somewhat: the unemployment rate in Nordhausen district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with higher rates in the city than in the bordering rural municipalities. Due to the official atheism in former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. 16.2% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 4.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Museums ===
* The &quot;Flohburg/Nordhausen-Museum&quot; at Barfüßerstraße is the municipal museum of Nordhausen hosting an exhibition about the city&#x27;s history. 
* The &quot;Museum Tabakspeicher&quot; at Bäckerstraße is a trade history museum, showing some items of the last centuries economic history. 
* The &quot;Kunsthaus Meyenburg&quot; at Alexander-Puschkin-Straße is Nordhausen&#x27;s arthistorical museum and shows temporary exhibitions of art. 
* The Mittelbau-Dora memorial north-west of the city hosts an exhibition about the history of this Nazi concentration camp and a memorial for its 20,000 victims.
* The &quot;IFA-Museum&quot; at Montaniastraße shows an exhibition of automotive engineering within an old Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau factory.

=== Cityscape ===
Nordhausen&#x27;s cityscape is marked by the near total destruction during the bombings in 1945, extinguishing most of the historic city centre. There were four historic city parts before: the &quot;old town&quot; within the city wall on a hill east of the Zorge valley, the &quot;new town&quot; within the valley between the river in the west, the city wall in the east, Hohensteinerstraße in the north and Vor dem Vogel street in the south, the &quot;Altendorf&quot; suburbium in the north-west around Altendorf and Am Alten Tor street and the &quot;Altnordhausen&quot; suburbium in the south-east around St. Mary&#x27;s Church on the hill. Altnordhausen and the new town are completely vanished, the old town was destroyed up to 90%, only some buildings around Barfüßerstraße, Domstraße and Bäckerstraße on the western edge remained, whereas Altendorf preserved entirely. So around 25 % of the old town remain. During the 19th and 20th century, the city enlarged to all directions, the worker&#x27;s districts were built up in the west at Zorge valley and Salza and to the east around Förstemannstraße and Leimbacher Straße. The mansion district developed in the north around Stolberger Straße and in the south and west along the railways, the big industrial areas are located.

The reconstruction after the World War II was carried out in altered manner, changing the grid and the structure of Nordhausen, which can be clearly seen along the new main streets Rautenstraße and Töpferstraße. Some areas were never built up again, for example those north and south of Kranichstraße and around Georgengasse. Peripheral Plattenbau settlements were built during the later GDR period in the east at Leimbacher Straße and in the north around the hospital. The village Salza in the north-west is grown together with Nordhausen since the 20th century.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* The &quot;Nordhausen Holy Cross Cathedral&quot; is the catholic parish church of Nordhausen. It was never a bishop&#x27;s seat but it&#x27;s also called a cathedral because it is dating back to a cathedral chapter monastery. The building was established between 1180 and 1400 and shows both Romanesque and Gothic style elements. 
* The &quot;St. Blaise&#x27;s Church&quot; is the evangelical main church of Nordhausen. It was built during the second half of the 15th century in Gothic style. 
* The &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s Church in the valley&quot; at Altendorf (north-western historic city part) is an evangelical parish church today and was built as monastery around 1353 in Gothic style. 
* The &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s Church on the hill&quot; at Frauenberg hill (south-eastern historic city part) is also an evangelical parish church arose from a monastery. It was built in the 12th century in Romanesque style and destroyed (about 80%) in 1945 during the bombings. Later, the ruins were involved in a modern reconstruction. 
* The &quot;Petri Tower&quot; is the remained steeple of the damaged &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s Church&quot; within the city centre. It was built in 1362. 
Furthermore, there were churches being destroyed by the 1945 bombings: the old main church St. Nicholas&#x27; and the new town&#x27;s church St. Jacob&#x27;s as well as the earlier abandoned monasteries of the Augustines, Franciscans and Dominicans.

==== Secular buildings ====
* The city wall was built between 13th and 15th century and remained in big parts (in the north, south-west and south-east). 
* The town hall was built in Renaissance style between 1608 and 1610 and is one of only few buildings being rebuilt after the destruction by the bombings in 1945. The Nordhausen Roland is the city&#x27;s landmark, it was established in 1717 as larger-than-life statue on the south-western corner of the town hall (wooden, today a copy, the original is shown in the museum).
* The &quot;Stadttheater&quot; was built between 1913 and 1917 and is in use a theatre until today. 
* The &quot;Walkenrieder Hof&quot; is a former storage building at Waisenstraße, built in 1345 and now used as municipal archive. 
* Some old buildings in city centre that survived the bombings in 1945 are only remained along Barfüßerstraße, Domstraße and Bäckerstraße on the western edge of the city centre and in the former suburbium &quot;Altendorf&quot; in the north-west. An interesting mansion district preserved north of the city centre with late-19th and early-20th century mansions.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
=== Agriculture, industry and services ===

Agriculture plays an important role to the present day. Approximately 57% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use. Cereals from the region are used in the making of a famous local spirit, the &quot;Nordhäuser Korn&quot;. Historically, sulfuric acid produced by the distillation of green vitriol (iron(II) sulfate) was known as Nordhausen oil of vitriol.

The primary industry of Nordhausen is in the production of heavy machinery. The region had a factory for the production of rail engines until 1942. Later the region&#x27;s plants produced truck motors, augers and excavators. Today, engineering is still the most important industrial branch of Nordhausen, although many factories have had to close following the reunification of Germany in 1990. In 2012 there were 35 companies of 20 workers or more were present in the industrial sector, all together employing 4,000 persons and generating an annual turnover of €800 mio, making Nordhausen the industrial core of Thuringia today.

Nordhausen is the biggest city in a circuit of , making it an important regional service hub for retail, medicine, education, government and culture (theatre, cinema etc.). A major shopping centre is the Südharz Galerie at Bahnhofstraße, and the Südharz Klinikum is one of the biggest hospitals in Thuringia.

=== Transport ===

Nordhausen has been a railway node since the late 19th century. The Halle–Kassel railway was opened in 1866/67, the South Harz Railway in 1869 and the Nordhausen–Erfurt railway also in 1869. In 1897, the narrow-gauge Trans-Harz Railway followed as the last one. Today, there are regional express trains to Halle in the east and Kassel in the west as well as local trains to Halle, Heiligenstadt, Erfurt and Göttingen (via Northeim), running every one to two hours. Nordhausen station is the main station, a second one is Nordhausen-Salza on the South Harz line. The narrow-gauge Trans-Harz-Railway is linked with the tramway network in a Tram-train system with many stops within Nordhausen.

Nordhausen is located on the Bundesautobahn 38 from Göttingen in the west to Halle and Leipzig in the east, opened in the 2000s. Furthermore, there are two Bundesstraßen connecting Nordhausen: the Bundesstraße 4 is a link to Erfurt in the south and to Braunschweig through the Harz mountains in the north and the Bundesstraße 243 connects Nordhausen with Hildesheim in the north-west. The former Bundesstraße 80 was annulled after the opening of the parallel Bundesautobahn 38 and the Bundesstraße 81 as a connection to Magdeburg starts a few kilometres north of the city at B 4. The B 4 (southern branch) and the B 243 shall be enlarged because of their importance as connections to and between Erfurt and Lower Saxony. Furthermore, there are important secondary roads to Heringen in the south-east and to Buchholz in the north-east.

The nearest airports are the Erfurt-Weimar Airport, to the south, the Leipzig/Halle Airport, to the east and the Hannover Airport, to the north-west.

For cycling, the long-distance &quot;Südharzroute&quot; trail network offers 10 trails in the region around Nordhausen.

The Nordhausen tramway network forms an important part of the public transport system, established in 1900. Furthermore, there are inner-city and regional bus services.

=== Education ===

Nordhausen has a &quot;&quot; (University of Applied Sciences) with 2,500 students that offers Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s degrees in business administration, public management, and business engineering, among others. Furthermore, there are two Gymnasiums in Nordhausen.

== Politics ==

===Mayor and city council===
The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Barbara Rinke of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who served from 1994 to 2012. She was succeeded by Klaus Zeh of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 2012 until his resignation in 2017. Independent Kai Buchmann was elected in the resulting election. The most recent mayoral election was held on 10 September 2023, with a runoff held on 24 September, and the results were as follows:

<text>Sheila Dikshit () (née Kapoor; 31 March 1938 – 20 July 2019) was an Indian politician. The longest-serving chief minister of Delhi, as well as the longest-serving female chief minister in Indian history, she served for a period of 15 years beginning in 1998. Dikshit led the Indian National Congress party to three consecutive electoral victories in Delhi.

Dikshit lost the December 2013 elections of the Delhi Legislative Assembly to the Bharatiya Janata Party, though Aam Aadmi Party formed a minority government with outside support from the INC, with Arvind Kejriwal as the chief minister. She briefly served as the Governor of Kerala in 2014. Dikshit was later declared a chief ministerial candidate for the Indian National Congress in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, but withdrew her nomination (Akhilesh Yadav were announced as candidate). She was appointed president of Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee on 10 January 2019 to led general election in Delhi and remained in office until her death in July later that year.

==Early years==
Sheila Kapoor was born on 31 March 1938 in the city of Kapurthala in the Kapurthala Princely State of British India (now in Punjab, India) into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family. Her father&#x27;s name was Sanjay Kapoor. She was educated at the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in New Delhi and graduated with a Master of Arts degree in history from the Miranda House at the University of Delhi.

== Political career ==
Sheila Dikshit was handpicked by Rajiv Gandhi to be part of his council of ministers after he became the prime minister in 1984. During the period between 1984 and 1989, she represented Kannauj parliamentary constituency of Uttar Pradesh. As a member of Parliament, she served on the Estimates Committee of Lok Sabha. Dikshit also chaired the Implementation Committee for Commemoration of Forty Years of India&#x27;s Independence and Jawaharlal Nehru centenary. She represented India at United Nations Commission on Status of Women for five years (1984–1989). She also served as a Union Minister during 1986–1989, first as the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and later as a minister of state in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. In Uttar Pradesh, she and her 82 colleagues were jailed in August 1990 for 23 days by the state government when she led a movement against the atrocities being committed against women.

Earlier, in the early 1970s, she was chairperson of the Young Women&#x27;s Association and was instrumental in the setting up of two of the most successful hostels for working women in Delhi. She was also the secretary of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust.

In the 1998 parliamentary elections, Dikshit was defeated by Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s Lal Bihari Tiwari in East Delhi constituency. Later in the year, Dikshit became Chief Minister of Delhi, a position she held until 2013. Dikshit represented the Gole Market assembly constituency in the 1998 and 2003 Assembly elections and New Delhi constituency from 2008.

In 2009 and 2013, Dikshit was investigated for alleged misuse of government funds, but no charges were brought.

Her party was wiped out in the 2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election and Arvind Kejriwal, founder of the Aam Aadmi party, won the election in the New Delhi Assembly constituency by a margin of 25,864 votes. She resigned on 8 December 2013, but remained the caretaker chief minister of Delhi until the new government was sworn in on 28 December 2013. She was appointed the governor of Kerala in March 2014, but was forced to resign five months later. She contested the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections as the candidate for Indian National Congress in the North East Delhi Constituency but came second after Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s Manoj Tiwari.

== Personal life ==
Dikshit was married to Vinod Dikshit, son of independence activist and former West Bengal governor Uma Shankar Dikshit from Unnao. He was an officer in the Indian Administrative Service.

Dikshit was the mother of two children: a son, Sandeep Dikshit, who is a former member of Parliament of the 15th Lok Sabha from East Delhi, and a daughter, Latika Dikshit, who was married to Syed Mohammad Imran, an architect.

Dikshit underwent angioplasty in November 2012. In 2018, she had heart surgery in University Hospital in Lille, France.

== Death ==
Dikshit was admitted to Fortis Escorts Heart Institute on 19 July 2019 for cardiac arrhythmia and was put on a ventilator within a few moments of her admission. Her condition stabilised temporarily, however she did not recover from multiple cardiac arrests and her condition worsened during the following period. She later died at 3:55 pm on 20 July 2019, at the age of 81.

The Delhi government announced a two-day mourning period on her death, and accorded her a state funeral.

<text>The Wasserkuppe () is a mountain within the German state of Hesse. It is a large plateau formation at an elevation of and is the highest peak in the Rhön Mountains. Great advances in sailplane development took place on the mountain during the interwar period, driven by annual contests. Near the summit there is still an airfield used by gliding clubs and pilots of light aircraft.

== Aeronautical development==
Students from the Darmstadt University of Technology, then known as &quot;Technische Hochschule Darmstadt&quot;, began flying gliders from the Wasserkuppe as early as 1911, but interest in gliding in Germany increased greatly after 1918 when the Treaty of Versailles restricted the production or use of powered aircraft in the nation. From 1920 onwards, annual gliding competitions were held, leading to records being set and broken for height, distance and duration of unpowered flight. In 1922 became the first glider pilot to use an updraft rising along a mountain slope to stay aloft for a lengthy period. He then founded the world&#x27;s first glider pilot school at the Wasserkuppe.

The first competition was organised by Oskar Ursinus, who also built the first clubhouse on the Wasserkuppe in 1924 to replace the shipping containers that enthusiasts were using as accommodation up to that point. By 1930, the competition had become an international event, drawing pilots from all over Europe and even the United States.

Also in 1924 &#x27;Rhönvater&#x27; (Rhön father) Oskar Ursinus convinced the then secretary of air transport for the ministry of transportation to turn the new gliding club into a state funded research organization. This started the Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft and as a result, the Wasserkuppe now had a gliding school, workshops for building gliders and a funded research facility. Alexander Lippisch was appointed as the managing director of the new society.

Virtually every German aeronautical engineer and test pilot of note during the 1920s and 1930s spent time building, testing, and flying aircraft at the Wasserkuppe, including the Günter brothers, Wolf Hirth, the Horten brothers, Robert Kronfeld, Hans Jacobs, Heini Dittmar, Alexander Lippisch, Willy Messerschmitt, Hanna Reitsch, Peter Riedel, and Alexander Schleicher. Beverley Shenstone, who was later a key part of the design team for the Spitfire, flew gliders at Wasserkuppe in 1930. This period saw great advances in new technologies such as flying wings and rocket-powered flights.

In the 1930s the &quot;Ehrenhalle&quot; (Hall of Honor) was constructed in the Lilienthal Haus, with heavy bronze doors opening into a large hall with a stained glass window. The centerpiece is a larger-than-life bronze figure of Otto Lilienthal lying on an (empty) tomb. It is a memorial to all pilots who have died in aviation accidents. The inscription on the memorial is Lilienthal&#x27;s famous last words: &quot;Opfer müssen gebracht werden&quot; roughly meaning: &quot;Sacrifices must be made.&quot;

In Nazi Germany, gliding activities became largely controlled by the state, and for Hitler Youth pilots and their instructors, proficiency in gliding was viewed as the first step towards the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Sailplane research was also nationalised under the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFSGerman Research Institute for Sailplane Flight).

Following World War II, a US Air Force base, radar station, and surveillance station were established there but when restrictions on German aviation were lifted in 1951, gliding soon returned to the Wasserkuppe where it has remained popular since. Beginning in the 1970s, the newer sport of hang gliding has also found a home there. Following the reunification of Germany and demise of the Soviet Union, the surveillance and radar installations were removed in the 1990s.


In 1970, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first competition, the &quot;Deutsches Segelflugmuseum&quot; (German Sailplane Museum) was opened on the plateau, with Neil Armstrong a guest of honour at the ceremony. The museum gained a new building in 1987. The Wasserkuppe is also the home of the &quot;Oldtimer Segelflugclub&quot; (OSC – Oldtimer Gliding Club), dedicated (as its name suggests) to flying vintage sailplanes.

Next to the long tradition of sailplanes the Wasserkuppe has become a sports and weekend centre offering a wide selection of activities. Paragliding as well as Snowkiting is offered. In winter the area is used by skiers and snowboarders.

<text>Acer Inc. (; ) is a Taiwanese multinational company that produces computer hardware and electronics, headquartered in Xizhi District, New Taipei City, Taiwan. Its products include desktop PCs, laptop PCs (clamshells, 2-in-1s, convertibles and Chromebooks), tablets, servers, storage devices, virtual reality devices, displays, smartphones, televisions and peripherals, as well as gaming PCs and accessories under its Predator brand. Acer is the world&#x27;s sixth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales.

In the early 2000s, Acer implemented a new business model, shifting from a manufacturer to a designer, marketer, and distributor of products, while performing production processes via contract manufacturers. Currently, in addition to its core IT products business, Acer also has a new business entity that focuses on the integration of cloud services and platforms, and the development of smartphones and wearable devices with value-added IoT applications.

==History==


Acer was founded as Multitech in 1976 by Stan Shih (), his wife Carolyn Yeh, and five others in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. The company began with eleven employees and US$25,000 in capital. Initially, it was primarily a distributor of electronic parts and a consultant in the use of microprocessor technologies. It produced the Micro-Professor MPF-I training kit, then two Apple II clones–the Microprofessor II and III–before joining the emerging IBM PC compatible market and becoming a significant PC manufacturer. The company was renamed Acer in 1987.

In 1998, Acer reorganized into five groups: Acer International Service Group, Acer Sertek Service Group, Acer Semiconductor Group, Acer Information Products Group, and Acer Peripherals Group. To dispel complaints from clients that Acer competed with its own products and to alleviate the competitive nature of the branded sales versus contract manufacturing businesses, the company spun off the contract business in 2000, renaming it Wistron Corporation. The restructuring resulted in two primary units: brand name sales and contract manufacturing. In 2001, the company sold its manufacturing units BenQ and Wistron in order to focus resources on design and sales.

Acer increased worldwide sales while simultaneously reducing its labor force by identifying and using marketing strategies that best utilized their existing distribution channels. In January 2005 became the president. By 2005, Acer employed a scant 7,800 people worldwide. Revenues rose from US$4.9 billion in 2003 to US$11.31 billion in 2006.

In the mid-2000s, consumer notebooks were almost the sole growth drivers for the PC industry, and Acer&#x27;s exceptionally low overheads and dedication to the channel made it one of the main beneficiaries of this trend. Acer grew quickly in Europe in part by embracing the use of more traditional distribution channels targeting retail consumers when some rivals were pursuing online sales and business customers. In 2007, Acer bought Gateway in the United States and Packard Bell in Europe, and became the third-largest provider of computers and the second largest for notebooks, achieving significant improvement in profitability. Acer has strived to become the world&#x27;s largest PC vendor in the belief that the goal can help it achieve economy of scale and garner higher margin. However, such a reliance on the high-volume, low-value PC market made Acer exposed when buying habits changed.

In September 2018, Acer spun-off its smart gadget unit GadgeTek Inc., which produces Leap Beads, smart prayer beads that track mantras and footsteps.

In 2019, Acer announced the esports social platform PLANET9, which aims to provide game analytics, community-organized competitions, and social experiences.

In November 2013, chairman and CEO J.T. Wang and president Jim Wong both resigned due to the company&#x27;s poor financial performance. Wang had been reportedly due to leave Acer at the end of the year and was supposed to have been succeeded by Wong. Acer co-founder Stan Shih took over as board chairman and interim president while the company searched for a new president. On December 23, 2013, Acer named Jason Chen, then the vice president of worldwide sales and marketing at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, as its new president and CEO, effective January 1, 2014.

== Corporate social responsibility ==

In 2005, Acer published its first environmental report, for which the company used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. All of Acer&#x27;s tier-one suppliers have acquired ISO 14001 certification.

In November 2012, Acer was ranked 4th place out of 15 in Greenpeace&#x27;s re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics, with a score of 5.1 points out of 10. The Guide ranks electronics makers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable.

Greenpeace criticized the company for not setting out targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as intended in 2010 and for not providing external verification for the GHG emissions it reports for its operations and business travel. It also scored badly on the products criteria receiving no points on product lifecycle while Greenpeace noted that a higher percentage of its products need to meet or exceed Energy Star standards in order for it to score more points.

It received some praise for launching new products which are free from Polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and the company informed Greenpeace that the majority of its products will be PVC/BFR free in the near future. Acer also scored well on chemical management for lobbying for restrictions on organo-halogens and was commended for reporting on GHG emissions from its first-tier suppliers and investigating its second tier.

In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Acer the seventh highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.

Acer has been listed on the DJSI&#x27;s Emerging Markets Index since 2014 and on MSCI&#x27;s Global Sustainability Indexes in 2015–2016.

==Sponsorships==

* Acer sponsored the Ferrari Formula 1 team from 2003 up to 2012 (Official Supplier since 2006) and its Top Sponsor of FC Internazionale – Milano (Inter Milan) Football Club. From 2007 to 2009 Acer has been Official Supplier of FC Barcelona. On 19 March 2007, Acer announced it would sponsor the Factory Fiat Yamaha Team for the 2007 MotoGP World Championship season. Since 2009, Packard Bell (part of Acer Group) has been the sponsor of the Yamaha Factory Racing Team.

*On 18 June 2019, Acer Predator sponsored Ubisoft Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege Pro League Season X, becoming the official PC Monitor of Rainbow Six Pro League and Majors.

==Controversies==
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Acer refused to join the international community and withdraw from the Russian market. Research from Yale University from March 28, 2022, identifying how companies were reacting to Russia&#x27;s aggression identified Acer in the worst category &quot;Digging in&quot; meaning Defying Demands for Exit: companies defying demands for exit/reduction of activities. Acer subsequently reversed its decision and suspended business in Russia. Despite stating that it would suspend business in Russia, a Reuters investigation of customs data found that Acer supplied at least $70.4 million worth of computer hardware to Russia between April 8, 2022 and March 31, 2023, and it was supplied to Russia both through Acer&#x27;s wholly-owned Swiss registered subsidiary. Since the shipments occurred outside Taiwan, they did not violate Taiwanese sanctions against Russia.

<text>Swan upping is an annual ceremony in England in which mute swans on the River Thames are rounded up, caught, ringed, and then released.

==History==
By prerogative right, the British Crown enjoys ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water. Rights over swans may, however, be granted to a British subject by the Crown (accordingly they may also be claimed by prescription). Until the 16th century, the ownership of swans in a given body of water was commonly granted to landowners. The only bodies who still exercise such rights are two livery companies of the City of London, the Worshipful Company of Vintners and the Worshipful Company of Dyers, who thus share equally with the Crown in the number of swans in the Thames that they own. The tradition of swan upping on the Thames began in the 12th century.

==Description==

Swan upping is the traditional means by which the swans on the Thames are apportioned among the three proprietors. Its main practical purposes today are to conduct a census of swans and check their health. It occurs annually in the third week of July. Over five days, the Crown&#x27;s, the Vintners&#x27; and the Dyers&#x27; respective &#x27;swan uppers&#x27; row up the river in skiffs (in recent centuries from Sunbury to Abingdon). 

The Crown&#x27;s swans are recorded by the Marker of the Swans, who is rowed in a skiff by oarsmen from the Company of Watermen and Lightermen. The Crown&#x27;s swan uppers, who wear distinctive red uniforms, catch the swans, weigh and measure the cygnets, and check them for injuries.

Based on their parentage, cygnets are determined to belong to the Crown, the Dyers or the Vintners. Swans belonging to the Crown are left unmarked, except for a lightweight ring linked to the database of the British Trust for Ornithology. Those belonging to the Dyers and Vintners receive a similar ring on the other leg. The rings have replaced nicks on the swans&#x27; bills, which used to be made with a metal implement, one nick for the Dyers and one on each side for the Vintners. The former practice is reflected in &quot;The Swan with Two Necks&quot;, the name of a former pub in the City connected with the Vintners, which was a corruption of &quot;The Swan with Two Nicks&quot;.

== Seigneur of the Swans ==
Seigneur of the Swans is a title of the British Monarch in regards to swan upping in England. The title which has stood for centuries and reflects the monarchs prerogative of ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water.

The present holder is King Charles III.

They have two officers charged with carrying out this responsibility on behalf of them, the Warden of the Swans and the Marker of the Swans both are offices of the royal household, before 1993 both positions were one position of the Keeper of the King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Swans.

The Marker of the Swans and Kings swan uppers, all wear the Royal Cypher of the current Monarch on their uniform.

On 20 July 2009, Queen Elizabeth II, as Seigneur of the Swans, attended the Swan Upping ceremony, the first time a reigning monarch had personally attended.

==Cancellations==
In 2012, exceptional high river flows for summer prompted a partial cancellation: between Sunbury and Windsor, the first time the tradition is known to have been cancelled (albeit partially).

The first known full cancellation took place in 2020 due to COVID-19 social distancing measures.

<doc id="397174" wikidata="Q1348138" url="?curid=397174" title="Stephen Vincent Benét">
<text>Stephen Vincent Benét ( ; July 22, 1898 – March 13, 1943) was an American poet, short story writer, and novelist. He wrote a book-length narrative poem of the American Civil War, &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;, published in 1928, for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, and for the short stories &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;, published in 1936, and &quot;By the Waters of Babylon&quot;, published in 1937. 

In 2009, Library of America selected his story &quot;The King of the Cats&quot;, published in 1929, for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of &quot;American Fantastic Tales&quot;, edited by Peter Straub.

==Early life and education==
Benét was born on July 22, 1898, in Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania to James Walker Benét, a colonel in the U.S. Army. His grandfather and namesake led the Army Ordnance Corps from 1874 to 1891 as a brigadier general and served in the Civil War. His paternal uncle Laurence Vincent Benét was an ensign in the U.S. Navy during the Spanish–American War who later manufactured the French Hotchkiss machine gun.

Around the age of ten, Benét was sent to the Hitchcock Military Academy in San Rafael, California. He graduated at the top of his class from Summerville Academy in Augusta, Georgia, and from Yale University, where he was &quot;the power behind the &quot;Yale Lit&quot;&quot;, according to Thornton Wilder, a fellow member of the Elizabethan Club. As a Yale University student, he also edited and contributed light verse to the campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot;. 

His first book was published when he was aged 17, and he was awarded an M.A. in English upon submission of his third volume of poetry in lieu of a thesis. He was also a part-time contributor to &quot;Time&quot; magazine in the magazine&#x27;s early years.

In 1920 and 1921, Benét was in France on a Yale traveling fellowship, where he met Rosemary Carr; the couple married in Chicago in November 1921. Carr was also a writer and poet, and they collaborated on some works. 

In 1926, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship award and, while living in Paris, wrote &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;.

==Career==
Benét helped solidify the place of the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition and Yale University Press during his decade-long judgeship of the competition. He published the first volumes of James Agee, Muriel Rukeyser, Jeremy Ingalls, and Margaret Walker. 

In 1929, Benét was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. 

Two years later, in 1931, he was awarded a fellowship by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Benét won the O. Henry Award three times: in 1932, for his short stories &quot;An End to Dreams&quot;; in 1937, for &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;; and in 1940, for &quot;Freedom&#x27;s a Hard-Bought Thing&quot;.

His fantasy short story &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; inspired several unauthorized dramatizations by other writers after its publication, which prompted Benét to adapt his own work for the stage. Benét approached composer Douglas Moore to create an opera of the work with Benét serving as librettist in 1937. 

&quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster: An Opera in One Act&quot;, published by Farrar &amp; Rinehart in 1939, premiered on Broadway that same year. The opera version of Benet&#x27;s &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; was created from 1937 through 1939, and its libretto served as the basis for a 1938 play adaptation of the work, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster: A Play in One Act&quot;, published by Dramatists Play Service in 1938. The play, in turn, was used as the source for a screenplay adaptation co-written by Benét, which was released in 1941 as &quot;All That Money Can Buy&quot;.

Benét also wrote a sequel, &quot;Daniel Webster and the Sea Serpent&quot;, in which Daniel Webster encounters Leviathan.

==Death==

Benét died of a heart attack in New York City on March 13, 1943, at age 44. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Stonington, Connecticut, where he owned the historic Amos Palmer House.

==Legacy==
On April 17, 1943, NBC Radio broadcast a special tribute to his life and works, which included a performance by Helen Hayes. He was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1944 for &quot;Western Star&quot;, an unfinished narrative poem on the settling of the United States.

Benét adapted the Roman myth of the rape of the Sabine Women into the story &quot;The Sobbin&#x27; Women&quot;. That story was adapted as the musical film &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954), then as a stage musical (1978) and then TV series (1982). His play &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; was staged on Broadway in 1953 in a three-person dramatic reading featuring Tyrone Power, Judith Anderson, and Raymond Massey, directed by Charles Laughton. The book was included in &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–44.

Dee Brown&#x27;s &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; takes its title from the final phrase of Benét&#x27;s poem &quot;American Names&quot;: &lt;poem&gt;&quot;You may bury my body in Sussex grass,
You may bury my tongue at Champmédy.
I shall not be there. I shall rise and pass.
Bury my heart at Wounded Knee.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
The last two lines are used as an epigram at the beginning of Brown&#x27;s book.

<doc id="397175" wikidata="Q71969" url="?curid=397175" title="Hexamethylenetetramine">
<text>Hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), also known as 1,3,5,7-tetraazaadamantane, is a heterocyclic organic compound with diverse applications. It has the chemical formula (CH2)6N4 and is a white crystalline compound that is highly soluble in water and polar organic solvents. It is useful in the synthesis of other organic compounds, including plastics, pharmaceuticals, and rubber additives. The compound is also used medically for certain conditions. It sublimes in vacuum at 280°C. It has a tetrahedral cage-like structure similar to adamantane. The four vertices are occupied by nitrogen atoms, which are linked by methylene groups. Although the molecular shape defines a cage, no void space is available at the interior.

==Synthesis, structure, reactivity==
Hexamethylenetetramine was discovered by Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859.
It is prepared industrially by combining formaldehyde and ammonia:

The molecule behaves like an amine base, undergoing protonation and as a ligand. &quot;N&quot;-alkylation with chloroallyl chloride gives quaternium-15).

==Applications==
The dominant use of hexamethylenetetramine is in the production of solid (powder) or liquid phenolic resins and phenolic resin moulding compounds, in which it is added as a hardening component. These products are used as binders, e.g., in brake and clutch linings, abrasives, non-woven textiles, formed parts produced by moulding processes, and fireproof materials.

===Medical uses===
The compound is also used medically as a urinary antiseptic and antibacterial medication under the name methenamine or hexamine. It is used as an alternative to antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and is sold under the brand names Hiprex, Urex, and Urotropin, among others.

As the mandelic acid salt (methenamine mandelate) or the hippuric acid salt (methenamine hippurate), it is used for the treatment of urinary tract infections. In an acidic environment, methenamine is believed to act as an antimicrobial by converting to formaldehyde. A systematic review of its use for this purpose in adult women found there was insufficient evidence of benefit and further research was needed. A UK study showed that methenamine is as effective as daily low-dose antibiotics at preventing UTIs among women who experience recurrent UTIs. As methenamine is an antiseptic, it may avoid the issue of antibiotic resistance.

Methenamine acts as an over-the-counter antiperspirant due to the astringent property of formaldehyde. Specifically, methenamine is used to minimize perspiration in the sockets of prosthetic devices.

===Histological stains===
Methenamine silver stains are used for staining in histology, including the following types:

* Grocott&#x27;s methenamine silver stain, used widely as a screen for fungal organisms.
* Jones&#x27; stain, a methenamine silver-Periodic acid-Schiff that stains for basement membrane, availing to view the &quot;spiked&quot; Glomerular basement membrane associated with membranous glomerulonephritis.

===Solid fuel===
Together with 1,3,5-trioxane, hexamethylenetetramine is a component of hexamine fuel tablets used by campers, hobbyists, the military and relief organizations for heating camping food or military rations. It burns smokelessly, has a high energy density of 30.0 megajoules per kilogram (MJ/kg), does not liquify while burning, and leaves no ashes, although its fumes are toxic.

Standardized 0.149 g tablets of methenamine (hexamine) are used by fire-protection laboratories as a clean and reproducible fire source to test the flammability of carpets and rugs.

===Food additive===
Hexamethylenetetramine or hexamine is also used as a food additive as a preservative (INS number 239). It is approved for usage for this purpose in the EU, where it is listed under E number E239, however it is not approved in the USA, Russia, Australia, or New Zealand.

===Reagent in organic chemistry===
Hexamethylenetetramine is a versatile reagent in organic synthesis. It is used in the Duff reaction (formylation of arenes), the Sommelet reaction (converting benzyl halides to aldehydes), and in the Delepine reaction (synthesis of amines from alkyl halides).

===Explosives===
Hexamethylenetetramine is the base component to produce RDX and, consequently, C-4 as well as octogen (a co-product with RDX), hexamine dinitrate, hexamine diperchlorate, HMTD, and R-salt.

From October 2023, sale of hexamethylenetetramine in the UK is restricted to licenced persons (as a &quot;regulated precursor&quot; under the terms of the Poisons Act 1972).

===Pyrotechnics===
Hexamethylenetetramine is also used in pyrotechnics to reduce combustion temperatures and decrease the color intensity of various fireworks. Because of its ash-free combustion, hexamethylenetetramine is also utilized in indoor fireworks alongside magnesium and lithium salts. 

==Historical uses==
Hexamethylenetetramine was first introduced into the medical setting in 1895 as a urinary antiseptic. It was officially approved by the FDA for medical use in the United States in 1967. However, it was only used in cases of acidic urine, whereas boric acid was used to treat urinary tract infections with alkaline urine. Scientist De Eds found that there was a direct correlation between the acidity of hexamethylenetetramine&#x27;s environment and the rate of its decomposition. Therefore, its effectiveness as a drug depended greatly on the acidity of the urine rather than the amount of the drug administered. In an alkaline environment, hexamethylenetetramine was found to be almost completely inactive.

Hexamethylenetetramine was also used as a method of treatment for soldiers exposed to phosgene in World War I. Subsequent studies have shown that large doses of hexamethylenetetramine provide some protection if taken before phosgene exposure but none if taken afterwards.
==Producers==
Since 1990 the number of European producers has been declining. The French SNPE factory closed in 1990; in 1993, the production of hexamethylenetetramine in Leuna, Germany ceased; in 1996, the Italian facility of Agrolinz closed down; in 2001, the UK producer Borden closed; in 2006, production at Chemko, Slovak Republic, was closed. Remaining producers include INEOS in Germany, Caldic in the Netherlands, and Hexion in Italy. In the US, Eli Lilly and Company stopped producing methenamine tablets in 2002. In Australia, Hexamine Tablets for fuel are made by Thales Australia Ltd. In México, Hexamine is produced by Abiya. Many other countries who still produce this include Russia, Saudi Arabia, and China.

== List of Chairpersons of the National Human Rights Commission of India ==
== Controversy ==
A report concerning how the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case was rejected, a case involving high-ranking officials, opened the organisation up to questioning over the usefulness of human rights commissions set up by the government at the national and state levels.
In mid-2011, the chairman of the NHRC, ex-Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan came under a cloud for allegedly owning assets disproportionate to his income. His son-in-law P. V. Srinijan, an Indian National Congress politician, had to resign for suddenly coming into possession of land worth Rs. 25 lakhs. Many prominent jurists, including former CJ J. S. Verma, SC ex-Judge V. R. Krishna Iyer, noted jurist Fali S. Nariman, former NHRC member Sudarshan Agrawal and prominent activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan, have called on Balakrishnan&#x27;s resignation pending from the NHRC pending inquiry. In February 2012, the Supreme Court of India inquired of the government regarding the status of the inquiry.

== Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s recommendations ==
The NHRC held that 16 out of 19 police encounters with suspected Maoists in Guntur and Kurnool districts of Andhra Pradesh, prior to 2002, were fake and recommended the Government payment of compensation of ₹5 lakh each to the kin of the families.

<doc id="397182" wikidata="Q8036350" url="?curid=397182" title="World Trade Centre Hong Kong">
<text>The World Trade Centre is a shopping centre and office tower complex in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. It is connected via passageway to its neighbour, The Excelsior.

The complex was developed by Jardines through its property development arm, Hongkong Land. It was later sold to Sun Hung Kai Properties. It is situated on land owned by Jardine since the early days of Hong Kong as a British Crown Colony at East Point, where Jardine had their original godowns and offices.

==History==
Located at No. 280 Gloucester Road, World Trade Centre was built in 1975. Although it originally housed the nightclub &quot;Palace Theatre&quot; (), it was later remodeled to be Hong Kong&#x27;s most luxurious cinema of the same name. The food and beverage corporation Maxim&#x27;s also established a restaurant branch in the building, and garnered relative fame at the time.

In 1990, World Trade Centre Group Ltd (formerly Bond Corporation International Ltd) purchased the building from Hongkong Land for HK$1.72 billion. The World Trade Centre was later sold to Sun Hung Kai Properties and was remodelled again to its present form, with the lower floors as a mall and the upper floors remaining as office space.

On 15 December 2021, a fire broke out in the World Trade Centre causing more than 300 people to be trapped on the building&#x27;s roof.

==Shopping arcade renovation==
In August 2006, Sun Hung Kai Properties announced that the centre will be expanded for HK$200 million, which included: expansion of number of floors from 6 to 15, additional glass on the floors, walls between shops made of glass, giant LED screen in the entrance, new design of whole centre and other small changes. Also, the working hours were extended, and World Trade Centre renamed as WTC.

The first phase of shopping arcade renovation started in October 2006. The floors built on this phase were shops and also office areas and a big exhibition hall on 13th floor.

Food &amp; Beverage outlets opened in January 2008 include Hea Place (9/F), Ruby Tuesday, Kung Tak Lam Shanghai Vegetarian Cuisine (10/F), Shanghai Lu Yang Cun Restaurant (11/F), Dragon King Restaurant (12/F), Myung Ga Korean Restaurant and Kiriyaki (13/F).

In February 2009, another renovation phase was held, which made multi-floor shops possible, thereafter the agnès b. store is located on 1st and 2nd floor, Muji and Uniqlo on 4th and 5th floor and Seaview Restaurant and mYoga yoga center on other floors. Most of the shops become vacant on 2019 and P1-5 level closed in December 2020 for the large scale renovation again.

==Palace Theatre Cinema==

After being converted from a nightclub, Palace Theatre Cinema was opened on 14 November 1979 by Shaw Brothers Studio. The cinema was regarded as one of the most extravagant in Hong Kong; whereas normal prime seats would cost 10 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), the cheapest seat in Palace Theatre costs 12 HKD. The 1060 larger and wider seats, the luxurious lobby, and the middle to upper class clientele signaled the birth of high-end cinemas for Hong Kong movie-goers.

The films shown were primarily from the West; the first film was &quot;Aliens&quot;. In 1981, Palace Theatre showed &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; starring Christopher Reeve, which remained in cinemas for 223 days, a record length for Hong Kong at the time. Between the period of 12 September 1981 and 22 April 1982, the box office at Palace Jade made 9.38 million HKD, also establishing a new record for foreign movies. Among other films, Palace Jade showed &quot;American Gigolo&quot; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; exclusively.

==Transport==
The World Trade Centre can be reached through exit D1 in MTR&#x27;s Causeway Bay station.

<text>Tri-Lakes is a region of Colorado in northern El Paso County. Taking its name from the three lakes in the region (Monument Lake, Palmer Lake and Lake Woodmoor), Tri-Lakes includes the incorporated towns and unincorporated communities of Monument, Palmer Lake, Woodmoor, Gleneagle, King&#x27;s Deer, and Black Forest. The region lies along the Palmer Divide about south of Denver and north of downtown Colorado Springs. The Air Force Academy is about to the south, and Interstate 25 goes north and south through the region.

==Population==
At the 2020 census, the population of Palmer Lake was 2,636, the population of Monument was 10,399, the population of Woodmoor was 9,536, the population of Gleneagle was 6,649, and the population of Black Forest was 15,097. The Census Bureau does not calculate a discrete population for King&#x27;s Deer, so Tri-Lakes&#x27; total population is around 44,317. Most of the region lies within the Lewis-Palmer School District.

<doc id="397187" wikidata="Q4288715" url="?curid=397187" title="Satyendra Dubey">
<text>Satyendra Dubey (27 November 1973 – 27 November 2003) was an Indian Engineering Service (IES) officer. He was the Project Director in the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) at Koderma, Jharkhand. He was murdered in Gaya, Bihar, allegedly for his anti-corruption related actions in the Golden Quadrilateral highway construction project.

==Early life==
Satyendra Dubey, the son of Bageshwari Dubey and Phulamati Devi, was born in the village of Shahpur, near Pratappur Sugar Factory in the Siwan district of Bihar, India. The family of seven children, five girls and two boys, subsisted on a small piece of land, and Bageshwari also held a low-paying clerical position in a nearby sugar mill. Until the age of 15, he studied at the Ganga Box Kanodiya High School in Shahpur and then joined junior college at Allahabad, about three hundred kilometers away. Satyendra was the topper of the state in 10th and 12th board exams. He gained admission to the Civil Engineering Department of IIT Kanpur in 1990 and graduated in 1994. He would subsequently complete his M. Tech (Civil Engg.) from the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (now Indian Institute of Technology, BHU) in 1996.

==Professional life==
After his masters, Satyendra joined the Indian Engineering Service (IES) and in July 2002, went on deputation to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). Dubey became the Project Director at Koderma, Jharkhand, responsible for managing a part of the Aurangabad-Barachatti section of National Highway 2 (The Grand Trunk Road). This highway was part of the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) Corridor Project, the Prime Minister&#x27;s initiative, which aimed to connect many of the country&#x27;s major cities by four-lane limited-access highways totaling 14,000 km, at an overall cost more than US$10 billion. During this period, Dubey got the contractor of the project to suspend three of his engineers after exposing serious financial irregularities. At one point, he had the contractor rebuild six kilometers of under-quality road, a huge loss for the road contract mafia.

==Murder and aftermath==
On 27 November 2003, his 30th birthday, Dubey was returning from a wedding in Varanasi and called his driver to meet him at the station. He reached Gaya railway station at three in the morning and found that the car was not able to come because of a battery malfunction. It appears that at this point, Dubey decided to take a rickshaw home. When he didn’t reach home, his driver went to look for him and found him dead by the side of the road in the suburb of A.P. Colony. He had been shot. The news ignited tremendous public hue and cry. The matter was raised in Parliament, and the Prime Minister shifted the onus of investigation from the Bihar Police (who might themselves be implicated) to the CBI.

The CBI registered a case against unknown persons under 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code and various provision under the Arms Act on 14 December 2003.

===The investigation===
In early investigations, the CBI interrogated the rickshaw puller Pradeep Kumar, who was caught using Dubey&#x27;s stolen cell phone. The mobile phone had been switched off for about a fortnight after the murder, but then Kumar called his &#x27;second wife&#x27; in Kolkata, following which the CBI traced the rickshaw puller to his slum in Gaya. Although Kumar had a criminal history in similar cases of robbery, it appears he was released after interrogation, and could not be traced a month later. Two other suspects, Sheonath Sah and Mukendra Paswan, were questioned by the CBI. They were found dead from poisoning on 1 February 2004, within 25 hours of the CBI questioning. Sah&#x27;s father lodged an FIR against the CBI with the Bihar Police, but CBI Director Uma Shanker Mishra called their deaths a suicide in a press meeting a few days later.
The CBI later arrested four persons, Uday Mallah, Mantu Kumar, Tutu Kumar and Babloo, all belonging to Katari village of Gaya on 6 June 2004. On 13 June, the CBI arrested another accused Sarvan Paswan. In conclusion of its investigations, CBI arraigned four persons on 3 September 2004. Based on testimony by Pradeep Kumar, who was his rickshaw puller, the event was presented as an attempted robbery. Because Satyendra put up a fight about giving up his briefcase, he was shot. The person accused of actually shooting Dubey with a country-made pistol was Mantu Kumar, son of Lachhu Singh, of Village Katari, Gaya district. Accomplices with him included Uday Kumar, Pinku Ravidas and Shravan Kumar.

Mantu Kumar was arrested near his home in Panchayatee Khada in Gaya. He had apparently been living in Gaya town and working as a rickshaw puller. On 19 September 2005, while the case was being heard in Patna, Bihar in the court of Addl. Session Judge, J M Sharma, Mantu Kumar escaped from the court premises, leading to widespread allegations of police complicity. While Mantu was being held at the high security Beur Jail, the invigilation can be lax during such court appearances, and it is a common tactic of the mafia to organise a few policemen to make it possible for the criminal to escape. It was felt that the escape was engineered by higher-ups who may have executed the murder through Mantu Kumar. The CBI announced a cash reward of ₹1,00,000 for apprehending Mantu.

===CBI Report and Conviction of accused===
It is possible that Dubey may have been the victim of a simple robbery during which Mantu Kumar shot him, as alleged in the case filed by CBI. However, given the death and disappearance of several witnesses and the startling escape of the prime accused, there is widespread speculation that vested interests may have engaged the criminals who actually pulled the trigger. As for the GQ project, the Supreme Court is currently overlooking investigations into the corruption charges initially raised by the Dubey letter. Several officials have been indicted, and a technical team is overseeing the actual construction. Also, as of September 2005, news reports indicated that the law ministry was about to introduce legislation to protect whistleblowers. Meanwhile, on 10 February 2006, a 600-meter stretch of the GQ highway connecting Kolkata to Chennai subsided into the ground, opening up a ten-meter gorge near Bally, West Bengal. This stretch had been executed as a joint venture between two Malaysian firms RBM and Pati, who had been awarded the contract after global tendering.

More than six years after the murder, on 22 March 2010, a Patna Court convicted three accused Mantu Kumar, Udai Kumar and Pinku Ravidas for murdering Dubey. The court convicted accused Mantu Kumar under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 302 (Murder) and 394 (Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), and section 27 (A) of the Arms Act for possessing an unlicensed weapon. The other two accused were convicted under Section 302/34 (Murder committed in furtherance of common intention) and 394 IPC.

<doc id="397189" wikidata="Q906899" url="?curid=397189" title="Etchū Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area that is today Toyama Prefecture in the Hokuriku region of Japan. Etchū bordered on Noto and Kaga Provinces to the west, Shinano and Hida Provinces to the south, Echigo Province to the east and the Sea of Japan to the north. Its abbreviated form name was .

==History==
 was an ancient province of Japan and is listed as one of the original provinces in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;. The region as a whole was sometimes referred to as . In 701 AD, per the reforms of the Taihō Code, Koshi was divided into three separate provinces: Echizen, Etchū, and Echigo.

However, in 702 AD, the four western districts of Etchū Province (Kubiki, Kosi, Uonuma and Kambara) were transferred to Echigo Province. Etchū annexed Noto Province in 741 AD, but Noto was separated out again in 757 AD. In 746 AD, the noted poet Ōtomo no Yakamochi became &quot;Kokushi&quot;, and left many references to the region in the poetic anthology &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;.

The Nara period provincial capital and provincial temple were located in what is now the city of Takaoka, Toyama; however, there are four shrines which vie for the title of &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; two of which are located in Takaoka, one in the city of Nanto and one in the town of Tateyama. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Etchū was ranked as a &quot;superior country&quot; (上国) in terms of importance and &quot;middle country&quot; (中国) in terms of distance from the capital. Despite this classification, Etchū never developed a powerful local &quot;gōzoku&quot; clan and was usually controlled by its more powerful neighbours.

During the Muromachi period, the Hatakeyama clan emerged as &quot;shugo&quot; of the region, but preferred to remain in Kyoto, and to rule through appointed deputies, such as the Jinbō clan and the Shiina clan. Into the Sengoku period, the Hatakeyama transferred their power base to Nanao Castle in Noto province, and Etchū became an area contested by the Uesugi Kenshin and the Oda clan with the &quot;Ikkō-ikki&quot; helping play one side against the other. The area was eventually conquered by Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s general Shibata Katsuie and his deputy Sassa Narimasa, who were later replaced by Maeda Toshiie under the rule of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Maeda clan retained control of the province under Kaga Domain during the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. During the mid-Edo period, Nei District and much of Niikawa District were separated from Kaga Domain into the 100,000 &quot;koku&quot; Toyama Domain, which was ruled by a branch of the Maeda clan.

Following the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the han system in 1871, Etchū Province was divided into Kanazawa Prefecture, Toyama Prefecture, Nanao Prefecture and Niikawa Prefecture, but these areas were reconsolidated into Ishikawa Prefecture in 1876. In 1883, Ishikawa Prefecture was divided, with the original four districts of Etchū Province becoming the new Toyama Prefecture. However, the name “Etchū Province” continued to appear in official documents afterwards for some administrative purposes. For example, Etchū is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

==Historical districts==
Etchū Province consisted of eight districts:

* Toyama Prefecture
** Imizu District (射水郡) – dissolved
*** Himi District (氷見郡) – split from Imizu District on April 1, 1896; now dissolved
** Nei District (婦負郡) – dissolved
** Niikawa District (新川郡):
*** Kaminiikawa District (上新川郡) – dissolved
**** Nakaniikawa District (中新川郡) – split from Kaminiikawa District on April 1, 1896
***Shimoniikawa District (下新川郡)
**Tonami District (礪波郡):
*** Higashitonami District (東礪波郡) – dissolved
*** Nishitonami District (西礪波郡) – dissolved

<doc id="397192" wikidata="Q666514" url="?curid=397192" title="Echigo Province">
<text>was an old province in north-central Japan, on the shores of the Sea of Japan. It bordered on Uzen, Iwashiro, Kōzuke, Shinano, and Etchū Provinces. It corresponds today to Niigata Prefecture, minus the island of Sado.

Its abbreviated form name was , with Echizen and Etchū Provinces. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Echigo was ranked as one of the 35 &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the 30 &quot;far countries&quot; (遠国) in terms of distance from the capital Kyoto.

Echigo and Kōzuke Province were known as the Jōetsu region.

==History==
In the late 7th century, during the reign of Emperor Monmu, the ancient province of was divided into three separate provinces: Echizen, Etchū, and Echigo. The new Echigo Province consisted of Iwafune and Nutari Districts, and was one of two border provinces of the Yamato state with the Emishi (the other being Mutsu). In 702, Echigo was given the four districts of Kubiki, Koshi, Uonuma and Kanbara from Etchū. When Japan extended its territory northward in 708, Dewa District was established under Echigo. But this district was transformed into Dewa Province in 712. Sado Province was temporarily merged with Echigo between 743 and 752. Since the division of Sado in 752, the territory of Echigo remained constant to the Meiji period.

The provincial capital of Echigo was located in Kubiki District, in what is now the city of Jōetsu, but its exact location is now unknown. The temple of , also in Jōetsu, claims to be the successor of the provincial temple of Echigo Province; however, its records date only to 1562 when it was relocated to its present location by Uesugi Kenshin. Two Shinto shrines vie for the title of &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of Echigo Province: Yahiko Shrine in Yahiko, and Kota Shrine in Jōetsu.

Echigo was ruled directly by the Hōjō clan during the Kamakura period, followed by the Uesugi clan from the start of the Muromachi period to the late Sengoku period. Under the Tokugawa shogunate of the Edo period, Echigo was divided among several feudal domains. The Hokurikudō highway passed through the province, and numerous post stations were established. The port of Niigata was also of major importance in the coastal &quot;kitamaebune&quot; trading system.

The area became a battleground during the Battle of Hokuetsu in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration. Following the establishment of the Meiji government, the various domains and provinces became prefectures with the abolition of the han system in 1871. These various prefectures merged to form Niigata Prefecture in 1876.

==Historical districts==
Echigo Province consisted of fifteen districts:

* Niigata Prefecture
** Dewa District (出羽郡) - split off to become Dewa Province

<text>The Lewis-Palmer School District (LPSD) is a school district in El Paso County, Colorado that serves the Tri-Lakes communities of Monument, Palmer Lake, Woodmoor and select areas of Colorado Springs.

Lewis-Palmer School District is home to Colorado&#x27;s largest public geothermal project, Palmer Ridge High School.

The district was &quot;Accredited with Distinction&quot; by the State of Colorado in 2010, recognizing that it is within the top 7% of Colorado school districts.

Like many American school systems, LPSD enforces zero-tolerance policies.

The Inez Johnson Lewis School in Monument is on the List of Registered Historic Places in Colorado.

== Schools ==

===Charter schools===
Monument Academy is a charter school located in Monument, and is the only charter school in Lewis-Palmer District 38. In 1995, a group of parents came together believing that they could create a school where high academic standards, small class sizes, respect, and responsibility were valued and emphasized. Lewis-Palmer Charter Academy (renamed Monument Academy in 2000) was founded in 1996.

In the first year, enrollment was approximately 180 students. MA has steadily grown since 1996 to the 2005-2006 school year enrollment of over 600 students. It now includes kindergarten through 8th grade. It previously had a high school program that closed, however in 2017, MA began planning to open a new high school no sooner than the 2018-19 school year. MA held a ribbon cutting ceremony on Aug. 29 2020 for the new east campus high school.

As a charter school, it is a publicly funded, tuition-free school created by parents, teachers, and community members. MA is required to meet or exceed district and state academic standards, as well as abide by all state and federal non-discrimination, health and safety laws. Recently however MA come under controversy allegedly violating SB08-200 with its new dress code implemented into the high school.

Monument Academy is called a Public School of Choice.

<text>The Goseibai Shikimoku (御成敗式目) or the Formulary of Adjudications was the legal code of the Kamakura shogunate in Japan, promulgated by third shikken Hōjō Yasutoki on 27 August 1232. It is also called Jōei Shikimoku (貞永式目) after the era name.

Before enacting the Goseibai Shikimoku, the Kamakura shogunate conducted trials without formal laws. After the Jōkyū War, an increasing number of land disputes between its vassals, aristocrats and peasants made fair trials indispensable. Thereafter Hōjō Yasutoki compiled the outline with 51 article headings and 13 Hyojoshu (councilors) completed it.

Supplementary articles to the Goseibai Shikimoku, called Tsuika (追加), were issued afterward. The Muromachi shogunate also adopted the Goseibai Shikimoku as the basic law. The Goseibai Shikimoku was largely repealed during the Edo period, though parts of it stayed in used until 1868, but was widely used as a textbook for writing in temple schools.

<text>This article provides a summary of results for the general elections to the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s unicameral legislative body, the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. The number of seats has varied over time, from a low of twenty-seven for the first election in 1949, to a high of fifty-two during the 1980s and early 1990s. There are currently 40 seats in the house.

The chart on the right shows the information graphically, with the most recent elections on the right. It shows that politics in Newfoundland and Labrador have been dominated by two parties: the Liberal party (red) and the Conservative party (blue). The Liberal party have won ten out of the seventeen elections held.

This article only covers elections since the province became part of the Canadian Confederation in 1949. It was then named &quot;Newfoundland&quot;, and its official name changed to &quot;Newfoundland and Labrador&quot; in 2001. Prior to becoming part of Canada, Newfoundland was a British dominion, and the Newfoundland House of Assembly (as it was known before 2001) was first formed in 1832. For elections prior to 1949, see General elections in Newfoundland (pre-Confederation).

<doc id="397211" wikidata="Q917376" url="?curid=397211" title="Battle of Agrigentum">
<text>The Battle of Agrigentum (Sicily, 262 BC) was the first pitched battle of the First Punic War and the first large-scale military confrontation between Carthage and the Roman Republic. The battle was fought after a long siege which started in 262 BC and resulted both in a Roman victory and the beginning of Roman control of Sicily.

==City==
Agrigentum is a city on the island of Sicily, from the southern coast. It is on a plateau, surrounded by steep slopes on all sides except the west. The city was protected by the Hypsas River (Drago) to the west and the Akragas River to the east. The natural barriers meant the only way to attack the city was from the west, making the city easily defensible. The city commanded a main route along the southern coast and also routes leading northwards and eastwards to other cities. The major status of Agrigentum meant that it was a target for invading forces, and in 262 BC the Romans attacked the city to prevent the Carthaginians from holding it and using it as a staging ground for an attack on Rome.

==Prelude to the Siege of Agrigentum==
In 288 BC, the Mamertines, Italian mercenaries that were hired to attack the Carthaginians, went to the city of Messana to protect it but instead massacred its men, took the land, and forced the women to become their wives. They then used the city as a base of operations for raiding neighboring cities. Hiero II, then leader of Syracuse, campaigned against the Mamertines. At some time between 268 and 265, Hiero II decisively defeated the Mamertines at the Longanus River, which caused the Mamertines to appeal to Carthage and Rome, the other major powers in the region besides Syracuse, for military aid. A Carthaginian commander in Sicily responded and sent a small force to garrison Messana’s citadel. Hiero II did not want openly to attack the Carthaginians and invite a war, so he retreated back to Syracuse.

Carthage had already been trying to control Sicily for centuries, and their main opposition had been the Greek colonies spread around the island. Syracuse, the wealthiest and most powerful of the Greek colonies in Sicily, had always been Carthage&#x27;s main opposition. Taking control of Messana allowed Carthage to decrease Syracuse&#x27;s power, and since Carthage already controlled North Africa, parts of Spain, Sardinia, and some small islands in the Mediterranean, control of Messana could lead to the conquest of Sicily. Additionally, Messana was an excellent staging area if the Carthaginians wanted to invade Italy and attack Rome.

While the Romans had been steadily expanding their territory for over a century, their army had never fought a battle outside of the Italian Peninsula. Carthage&#x27;s control of an invasion route into Italy threatened Rome&#x27;s newly conquered territory in southern Italy as well as Rome itself. In 264 BC, the Roman Senate voted to send an expedition to Sicily under the command of Appius Claudius Caudex, one of the consuls for that year. Whether the Centuriate Assembly of Rome formally declared war is disputed. Adrian Goldsworthy has maintained that it was highly unlikely, and that, although the Romans knew war with Syracuse was almost a certainty, they believed their military would deter or swiftly defeat any opposition in Sicily.

The Romans intended to send two legions to Sicily in 262 BC, and were probably willing to negotiate peace with Carthage. Since 264 BC, when they had declared war on Carthage, there had not been much serious fighting between the two except for a small battle in the straits of Messana. Eventually, in 264 BC, the Romans took Messana and defeated the Syracusan and Carthaginian armies around the town. In 263 BC, the Syracusans, who had initially opposed the Roman takeover of Messana, made peace with them and began supplying their troops. Following the defection of Syracuse, several small Carthaginian dependencies switched to the Romans. The Carthaginians made conciliatory gestures at the start of the war, but by 262 BC, they started to increase their forces in Sicily. Once the Carthaginians started increasing their forces on the island, the Romans sent consuls there. The consuls were the generals of the Roman army, and with them came several legions. The Carthaginians hired Ligurian, Celtic, and Spanish mercenaries to encourage their enemies in Sicily to attack the Romans on the half of the island which the Romans controlled. After the loss of Messana and the arrival of numerous Carthaginian reinforcements, Agrigentum became the main base of operations for the Carthaginian military on the island.

The Carthaginians began sending forces to Sardinia using sea power, but most of their army was in Sicily. It seemed that they planned to use the island as a base for attacks on Italy. The Roman consuls, Lucius Postumius Megellus and Quintus Mamilius Vitulus focused their forces on Agrigentum. The consuls commanded a combined force of 40,000 men. Hannibal Gisco, the commander of Agrigentum and the son of Gisgo, gathered many of the people who lived in the area surrounding the city behind the city walls, swelling the population of the city to about 50,000; his garrison was relatively small. Hannibal refused to fight outside the city walls, which the Romans might have seen as a sign of weakness. The Romans then set up their camp about a mile from the city and harvested the crops from the area.

==Siege==
Hannibal finally attacked the Romans while they were harvesting the crops in the fields. The Romans, outnumbered and unarmed, fled the area. The picket guarding their camp was the Romans&#x27; only fortification, and although they lost many men, they were able to defeat another Carthaginian contingent that was attempting to penetrate the camp. This first skirmish made Hannibal realise that he could not afford to lose any more men. He became increasingly reluctant to attack again, and the Romans realised they had underestimated their enemy.

The Roman consuls realised that they had to cut off Agrigentum from the outside world and blockade the city to cause starvation in order to force its inhabitants to surrender. The Romans began digging a system of ditches and small forts surrounding the city to prevent the inhabitants from preparing for the siege. The consuls divided their forces, with one force near the Temple of Asklepios to the south of the city and the other force stationed to the west of the city. There was a stalemate for five months until November 262 BC when supplies began to run out in Agrigentum. Hannibal became increasingly concerned over the limited resources, so he sent urgent messages to Carthage appealing for help. Carthage sent a relief force from Africa commanded by Hanno, whom historians believe to have been the son of Hannibal. There are varying accounts as to the details of Hanno’s army. Polybius, the Greek historian, stated that there were about 50 elephants, Numidian cavalry, and mercenaries. Diodoros, another historian, wrote there were 50,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, and 60 elephants. Yet another historian, Orosius refers to 30,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, and 30 elephants.

Hanno first advanced and concentrated his troops at Heraclea Minoa, about west of Agrigentum. Hanno managed to capture the Roman supply base at Herbesos, causing shortages in supplies in the Roman camp, which led to disease and privation. This seizure of the Roman supplies also cut off the Roman lines of communication. Hanno then marched on, telling his Numidian cavalry to attack the Roman cavalry and then feign retreat. The Romans pursued the Numidians as they retreated and were brought to the main Carthaginian column. The Romans suffered many losses. Hanno then took a position on Toros (Torus), a hill about a mile from the Romans camp, where further skirmishes took place for two months, causing the siege to last from six to seven months.

With Hanno camped outside their own camp, the Roman supply lines from Syracuse were no longer available. With their own army at risk of starvation, the consuls chose to offer battle. This time it was Hanno&#x27;s turn to refuse, probably with the intention of defeating the Romans by hunger. Meanwhile, the situation inside Agrigentum after more than six months of siege was close to desperate. Hannibal, communicating with the outside by smoke signals, sent urgent pleas for relief, and Hanno was forced to accept a pitched battle. While there are several accounts giving details of the actual fighting, they are—as is common with ancient records—inconsistent and difficult to reconcile.

==Battle==
The Greek historian Polybius says that for two months, the two enemies were stationed close together outside the city without any direct conflict. Hannibal, still in the city, was sending a constant flow of messages and fire-signals stressing the city’s food shortages and desertion of the enemy which caused Hanno to fight. The Romans, who were also close to starvation, accepted the fight. After a long struggle, the Romans killed most of the Carthaginians; the Carthaginians lost 3,000 infantry and 200 cavalry killed, as well as 4,000 prisoners and eight elephants killed and 33 disabled. Throughout the whole siege, the Romans lost 30,000 infantry and 540 cavalry or more plausibly, one-third of their 40,000–50,000 troops. The high Roman losses and the escape of the Carthaginian army meant that no triumph was awarded for either consul.

Byzantine writer Zonaras wrote that Hanno deployed his army to battle but the Romans declined to fight because of the previous defeat of their cavalry. As food shortages became more severe, the consuls finally decided to fight, but Hanno was deterred by their confidence. Hanno originally wanted to co-ordinate his attack with Hannibal’s, but the Romans became aware of the plan. The Romans then ambushed the Carthaginian rear, so when Hanno attacked them, he was taken from both front and rear. The Romans also defeated an attack by the Carthaginian garrison.

A more likely version of the battle is that Hanno deployed the Carthaginian infantry in two lines, with the elephants and reinforcements in the second and the cavalry probably placed in the wings. The Romans battle plan is unknown but they typically organized in their triplex acies formation. All the sources agree that the fighting was long and that it was the Romans who managed to break the Carthaginian front. This provoked panic in the rear and the reserves fled the battlefield. It is also possible that the elephants also panicked and in their flight disorganized the Carthaginian formation. The Romans routed the enemy and were victorious. Their cavalry managed to attack the Carthaginian camp and capture several elephants. But this was not a complete success. Most of the enemy army fled and Hannibal Gisco, together with the garrison of Agrigentum, also managed to break the Roman line and escape for security.

No matter which of the three versions is correct, the Romans defeated the Carthaginians and forced Hanno to retreat. The night after the battle, Hannibal managed to escape Agrigentum with his mercenaries by filling the Roman trenches with straw. The next morning, the Romans pursued Hannibal and his garrison, and attacked the rear-guard, but eventually turned back to take control of Agrigentum. While seizing the city without opposition, they plundered the city and sold 25,000 inhabitants into slavery.

==Aftermath==
Following this battle (the first among four pitched land battles fought in the First Punic War), the Romans occupied Agrigentum and sold the whole population into slavery. Though acts of brutality like this were commonplace, it proved counterproductive. It hardened the attitude of many other towns which might otherwise have proven friendly to Rome. The taking of Agrigentum was a significant victory for the Romans, although they came close to disaster on multiple occasions. Because Hannibal and his garrison managed to escape relatively unharmed, there was no Roman triumph for the two consuls, and it detracted from the success of the battle.

After 261 BC, Rome controlled most of Sicily and secured the grain harvest for its own use. This victory in the first large-scale campaign fought outside Italy gave the Romans extra confidence to pursue overseas interests.

<text>John Taliaferro () (anglicized to &quot;Tolliver&quot;) Thompson (December 31, 1860 – June 21, 1940) was a United States Army officer known for being the inventor of the Tommy gun.

==Early life==
Born on December 31, 1860, in Newport, Kentucky, Thompson grew up on a succession of Army posts and had decided on the military as a career by the age of sixteen. His father was Lt. Col. James Thompson, his mother was Maria Taliaferro. He attended Indiana University and was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. After a year of class, in 1877, he gained an appointment to the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, from where he graduated in June 1882. Among his classmates there at the academy were several men who would, like Thompson himself (who graduated 11th in a class of 37), eventually attain the rank of brigadier general or higher during their military careers, such as Edward Burr, Lansing H. Beach, Adelbert Cronkhite, Charles Treat, Edward A. Millar, Richard W. Young, Benjamin Alvord Jr., George W. McIver, Henry T. Allen, William H. Sage, Thomas B. Dugan, and William H. Allaire.

His first duty station was at Newport Barracks (near in his birthplace of Newport, Kentucky), where he was assigned to the 2nd Artillery as a second lieutenant. He then attended engineering and artillery schools and was finally assigned to the Army&#x27;s Ordnance Department in 1890, where he spent the rest of his military career. During this period he began his specialization in small arms.

==Spanish–American War==
With the beginning of the Spanish–American War, Thompson was promoted to lieutenant colonel and sent to Tampa, Florida as Chief Ordnance Officer for the commander of the Cuban campaign, General William R. Shafter. While the rest of the Army was plagued with logistical problems, Thompson managed ordnance supply operations to Cuba efficiently. More than 18,000 tons of munitions were transferred to the battlefield from his Tampa command without any accidents. Thompson was promoted to colonel, the youngest such in the Army at the time.

It was also this war that offered Thompson his first exposure to automatic weapons. At the request of Lt. John H. Parker, Thompson arranged for the informal formation of a Gatling gun unit, with fifteen weapons and a generous supply of ammunition, all shipped to Cuba on Thompson&#x27;s sole authority. This unit later played a significant role in the Battle of San Juan Hill.
After the war, Thompson was appointed the chief of the Small Arms Division for the Ordnance Department. While in this position he supervised the development of the M1903 Springfield rifle and chaired the ordnance board that approved the M1911 pistol. For the latter, he devised unusual tests involving firing the weapon at donated human cadavers and live cattle to assess ammunition effectiveness.

==World War I==
World War I began in Europe in 1914, and Thompson was sympathetic to the Allied cause. Since the U.S. did not immediately enter the war, and because he recognized a significant need for small arms in Europe (as well as an opportunity to make a substantial profit), Thompson retired from the Army in November of that year and took a job as Chief Engineer of the Remington Arms Company. While with the company he supervised the construction of the Eddystone Arsenal in Chester, Pennsylvania, at that time the largest small arms plant in the world. It manufactured Pattern 1914 Enfield rifles for British forces, and Mosin–Nagant rifles for Russia.

The introduction of trench warfare in the war changed tactics substantially, and by 1916 Thompson was experimenting again with automatic small arms, this time attempting to design a weapon that troops could use to clear an enemy trench—what he called a &quot;trench broom.&quot; Thompson studied several designs and was impressed with a delayed-blowback breech system designed by John Blish, a commander in the United States Navy. With Blish as a partner, Thompson obtained the necessary venture capital to form the Auto-Ordnance Company, and began working on the design of what eventually became the Thompson submachine gun.

When the United States finally entered the war in April 1917, Thompson returned to the Army and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. He served as Director of Arsenals throughout the remainder of the war, in which capacity he supervised all small-arms production for the Army. For this service he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the citation for which reads:

He retired again after the war, in December 1918, and resumed work perfecting the &quot;Tommy Gun.&quot;

Thompson originally pursued the Autorifle concept: a rifle utilizing the Blish principle delayed-blowback action to avoid the complexity of recoil-operated and gas-operated actions. Testing found that the military issue .30-06 cartridge was too powerful to work satisfactorily using the Blish system.

Thompson eventually decided to use the same .45 caliber ammunition in the Thompson submachine gun that he had vetted for use in the M1911 while in the Army. The weapon was patented in 1920, but the major source for contracts had ended with the armistice. Thompson, therefore, marketed the weapon to civilian law enforcement agencies, who bought it in respectable quantities. However, by 1928, low sales had led the company to the financial crisis, and Thompson was replaced as head of the Auto-Ordnance Company.

==Personal life==
Thompson married Juliet Estelle Hagans. Their son Marcellus Hagans Thompson was a 1906 West Point graduate who retired from the Army in 1919 as a captain to join his father&#x27;s automatic weapons business.

== Death ==
Thompson died at the age of 79 on June 21, 1940, and is buried on the grounds of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Shortly after his death, the looming entry of the U.S. into World War II prompted the Army to order the Thompson submachine gun in large quantities, and it was used extensively during that conflict in both original and modified versions.

<text>The M1903 Springfield, officially the U.S. Rifle, Caliber .30, M1903, is an American five-round magazine-fed, bolt-action service repeating rifle, used primarily during the first half of the 20th century.

The M1903 was first used in combat during the Philippine–American War, and it was officially adopted by the United States as the standard infantry rifle on 19 June 1903, where it saw service in World War I, and was replaced by the faster-firing semi-automatic eight-round M1 Garand starting in 1936. However, the M1903 remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II, since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a sniper rifle during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector&#x27;s piece, a competitive shooting rifle, and as a military drill rifle.

==History==
===Background===
During the 1898 war with Spain, the Mauser M1893 used by the Spanish Army gained a deadly reputation, particularly from the Battle of San Juan Hill, where 750 Spanish regulars significantly delayed the advance of 15,000 US troops armed with outclassed Springfield Krag–Jørgensen bolt-action rifles and older single-shot Springfield model 1873 trapdoor rifles. The Spanish soldiers inflicted 1,400 casualties on the US in a matter of minutes. Likewise, earlier in the day, a Spanish force of 540 regulars armed with the same Mauser rifles, under Spanish general Vara Del Rey, held off General Henry Ware Lawton&#x27;s Second Division of 6,653 American soldiers and an independent brigade of 1,800 men for ten hours in the nearby town of El Caney, keeping that division from assisting in the attack on the San Juan Heights. A US Army board of investigation was commissioned as a direct result of both battles. They recommended replacement of the Krag.

The 1903 adoption of the M1903 was preceded by nearly 30 years of struggle and politics, using lessons learned from the recently adopted Krag–Jørgensen and contemporary German Mauser Gewehr 98 bolt-action rifles. The design itself is largely based on the Mauser M1893 and its successive models up to the Gewehr 98 rifle. The M1903&#x27;s forward receiver ring diameter is , slightly over the ring diameter of the older &quot;small ring&quot; Mauser models and less than the &quot;large ring&quot; Gewehr 98s. The US military licensed many of the Mauser Company&#x27;s and other German patents, including the spitzer bullet, later modified into the .30-06 Springfield. The M1903 not only replaced the various versions of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Krag, but also the Lee M1895 and M1885 Remington–Lee used by the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as all remaining single-shot trapdoor rifles. While the Krag had been issued with barrel lengths of both 30-inch rifle and 22-inch carbine models, the Springfield was issued only as a short 24-inch-barrel rifle in keeping with current trends in Switzerland and Great Britain to eliminate the need for both long rifles and carbines.

The two main problems usually cited with the Krag were its slow-to-load magazine and its inability to handle higher chamber pressures for high-velocity rounds. The United States Army attempted to introduce a higher-velocity cartridge in 1899 for the existing Krags, but its single locking lug on the bolt could not withstand the extra chamber pressure. Though a stripper-clip or charger loading modification to the Krag was designed, it was clear to Army authorities that a new rifle was required. After the U.S. military&#x27;s experience with the Mauser rifle in the 1898 Spanish–American War, authorities decided to adopt a stronger Mauser-derived bolt-action design equipped with a charger- or stripper clip-loaded box magazine.
===Advances in small arms technology===
In 1882, the bolt action Remington Lee rifle design of 1879, with its newly invented detachable box magazine, was purchased in limited numbers by the U.S. Navy. Several hundred M1882 Lee Navy models (M1882 Remington-Lee) were also subjected to trials by the U.S. Army during the 1880s, though the rifle was not formally adopted. The Navy adopted the M1885, and later different style Lee M1895 (a 6 mm straight pull bolt), which saw service in the Boxer Rebellion. In Army service, both the M1885 and M1895 6 mm Lee were used in the Spanish–American War, along with the .30-40 Krag and the .45-70. The Lee rifle&#x27;s detachable box magazine was invented by James Paris Lee, and was very influential on later rifle designs. Other advancements had made it clear that the Army needed a replacement. In 1892, the U.S. military held a series of rifle trials, resulting in the adoption of the .30-40 Krag–Jørgensen rifle. The Krag officially entered U.S. service in 1894, only to be replaced nine years later by the M1903.

===Development===
Thousands of Spanish Mauser M1893 rifles, surrendered by Spanish troops in Cuba, were returned to the US and extensively studied at Springfield Armory, where it was decided that the Mauser was the superior design.

====U.S. rifle Model 1900 .30 prototype====
A prototype rifle was produced in 1900; it was very similar to rifle No. 5, the final Mauser M92 prototype in the U.S. Army rifle trials of 1892. This design was rejected, and a new design combining features of the M1898 Krag rifle and the Spanish Mauser M1893 was developed.

====U.S. rifle Model 1901 .30 prototype====
Springfield began work on creating a rifle that could handle higher loads around the turn of the 20th century. The Springfield Model 1901 prototype combined the Krag–Jørgensen&#x27;s cock-on-opening bolt, 30-inch barrel, magazine cutoff, stock and sights with the Mauser M1893&#x27;s dual locking lugs, external claw extractor, and staggered-column magazine. Taking a cue from the Mauser Gewehr 98, a large safety lug was added to the side of the bolt behind the extractor, which engaged the receiver bridge and prevented the bolt from moving rearwards. The bolt handle was also bent downwards, to make it faster to operate. The Model 1901 almost entered production. Springfield was sure enough that the Model 1901 prototype would be accepted that they began making some of the parts for it, but it was not accepted; further changes were asked for.

===Adoption===
Following then-current trends in service rifles, the barrel was shortened to 24 inches after it was discovered that a longer barrel offered no appreciable ballistic advantage, and the shorter barrel was lighter and easier to handle. This &quot;short rifle&quot; also eliminated the need of a shorter carbine for mounted troops or cavalry. A spike-type bayonet with storage in the forend of the stock was added to the design. This new design was accepted, type classified and officially adopted as the &quot;United States Rifle, Caliber .30, Model 1903&quot; and entered production in 1903. The M1903 became commonly known among its users as the &quot;aught-three&quot; in reference to the year, 1903, of first production.

Despite Springfield Armory&#x27;s use of a two-piece firing pin and other slight design alterations, the M1903 was, in fact, a Mauser design, and after that company brought suit, the U.S. government was judged to pay $250,000 in royalties to Mauser Werke.

By January 1905, over 80,000 of these rifles had been produced at the federally-owned Springfield Armory. However, President Theodore Roosevelt objected to the design of the sliding rod-type bayonet used as being too flimsy for combat. In a letter to the secretary of war, he said:

I must say that I think that ramrod bayonet is about as poor an invention as I ever saw. As you observed, it broke short off as soon as hit with even moderate violence. It would have no moral effect and mighty little physical effect.

All the rifles to that point consequently had to be re-tooled for a blade-type bayonet, called the &quot;M1905&quot;. The sights were also an area of concern, so the new improved Model 1904 sight was also added.

The retooling was almost complete when it was decided another change would be made. It was to incorporate improvements discovered during experimentation in the interim, most notably the use of pointed ammunition, first adopted by the French in the 1890s and later other countries. The round itself was based on the .30-03, but rather than a 220-grain (14 g) round-tip bullet fired at , it had a 150-grain (9.7 g) pointed bullet fired at ; the case neck was a fraction of an inch shorter as well. The new American cartridge was designated &quot;Cartridge, Ball, Caliber .30, Model of 1906&quot;. The M1906 cartridge is better known as the .30-06 Springfield round, used in many rifles and machine guns, and is still a popular civilian cartridge to the present day. The rifle&#x27;s sights were again re-tooled to compensate for the speed and trajectory of the new cartridge.

By the time of the 1916 Pancho Villa Expedition, the M1903 was the standard issue service rifle of US forces. Some rifles were fitted with both the Warner &amp; Swasey Model 1913 and 1908 &quot;musket sights&quot; during the campaign, &quot;musket sights&quot; being the vernacular at the time for telescopic sights. The Warner &amp; Swasey Model 1913 musket sight continued to see service after the Pancho Villa Expedition and during World War I but was eventually deemed inadequate and was removed from the US Army&#x27;s inventory by the 1920s.

The military tested several M1903 rifles with Maxim suppressors starting in 1909, and requisitioned 500 in 1910 to be used for recruit training. Anecdotal evidence indicates that some of the M1903 rifles during the Pancho Villa Expedition were fitted with Maxim suppressors, possibly making them the first suppressed rifles used in the field by the US military; however, during World War I American M1903s were not fitted with suppressors due to opposition from officers and the fact that suppressors would preclude the use of bayonets.

===World War I and interwar use===
By the time of US entry into World War I, 843,239 M1903 rifles had been produced at Springfield Armory and Rock Island Arsenal. Pre-war production utilized questionable metallurgy. Some receivers constructed of single-heat-treated case-hardened steel were improperly subjected to excessive temperatures during the forging process. The carbon could be &quot;burnt&quot; out of the steel, producing a brittle receiver. Despite documented evidence indicating some early rifles were improperly forged, actual cases of failure were very rare. Although several cases of serious injury from receiver failure were documented, the U.S. Army never reported any fatalities. Many failures were attributed to use of incorrect cartridges, such as the 7.92×57mm Mauser. Evidence also seems to suggest that improperly forged brass cartridge cases could have further exacerbated receiver failure.

Pyrometers were installed in December 1917 to accurately measure temperatures during the forging process. The change was made at approximately serial number 800,000 for rifles made at Springfield Armory and at serial number 285,507 at Rock Island Arsenal. Lower serial numbers are known as &quot;low-number&quot; M1903 rifles. Higher serial numbers are said to be &quot;double-heat-treated&quot;.

Toward the end of the war, Springfield turned out the Model 1903 Mark I. The Mark I has a cut on the left hand side of the receiver meant to act as an ejection port for the Pedersen device, a modified sear and cutoff to operate the Pedersen device; a specialized insert that replaced the bolt and allowed the user to fire .30 caliber pistol cartridges semi-automatically from a 40-round detachable magazine. The stock was also slightly cut down on the left side to clear the ejection port. In all other respects, the Mark I is identical to the M1903. Temperature control during forging was improved prior to Mark I production. The receiver alloy was toughened by addition of nickel after Mark I production.

In 1926, after experiencing the effect of long-range German 7.92×57mm rifle and machine gun fire during the war, the U.S. Army adopted the heavy, 174-grain, boat-tail bullet for its .30-06 cartridge, standardized as &quot;Cartridge, Ball, caliber 30, M1&quot;. M1 ammunition, intended primarily for long-range machine gun use, soon became known by Army rifle competition teams and expert riflemen for its considerably greater accuracy over that of the M1906-round; the new M1 ammunition was issued to infantrymen with the Springfield rifle as well as to machine gun teams. However, during the late 1930s, it became apparent that, with the development of mortars, high-angle artillery, and the .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun, the need for extreme long-range, rifle-caliber machine-gun fire was decreasing. In 1938, the US Army reverted to a .30-06 cartridge with a 152-grain flat-base bullet, now termed &quot;M2 ball&quot;, for all rifles and machine guns.

In the 1920s and the 1930s, M1903s were delivered to US allies in Central America, such as Cuba, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. Costa Rica troops were equipped with Springfields during the Coto War and some rifles were captured by the opposing Panamanians. The Cuban Springfields were used by Batista forces after WW2 and later by the Revolutionary Armed Forces, for instance during the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation acquired some M1903 rifles configured like National Rifle Association sporter models in response to the 1933 Kansas City Massacre.

In service, the Springfield was generally prized for its reliability and accuracy, though some problems remained. The precision rear aperture sight was located too far from the eye for efficient use, and the narrow, unprotected front sight was both difficult to see in poor light and easily damaged. The Marine Corps issued the Springfield with a sight hood to protect the front sight, along with a thicker front blade. The two-piece firing pin-striker also proved to be no improvement over the original one-piece Mauser design, and was a cause of numerous ordnance repairs, along with occasional reports of jammed magazine followers.
===World War II===
World War II saw new production of the Springfield at private manufacturers such as the Remington Arms and Smith-Corona Typewriter companies. Remington began production of the M1903 in September 1941, at serial number 3,000,000, using old tooling from the Rock Island Arsenal which had been in storage since 1919. The very early Remington-made rifles are almost indistinguishable from 1919-made Rock Island rifles. As the already worn tooling began to wear beyond use Remington began seeking Army approval for a continuously increasing number of changes and simplifications to both speed up manufacture and improve performance. The milled parts on the Remington M1903 were gradually replaced with stamped parts until, at about serial number 3,330,000, the Army and Remington recognized that a new model name was appropriate. Other features of the M1903, such as high-grade walnut stocks with finger grooves, were replaced with less expensive but serviceable substitutes. Most milled parts made by Remington were marked with an &quot;R&quot;.

Production of the M1903 was discontinued in favor of the M1903A3. The most noticeable visual difference in the M1903A3 was the replacement of the barrel-mounted rear sight with a smaller, simpler aperture rear sight mounted on the rear of the receiver which was designed by Remington; it was primarily adopted in order to speed familiarization by soldiers already trained on the M1 Garand, which had a similar sighting system. However, the leaf spring providing tension to the elevation adjustment on the new aperture sight tended to weaken with continued use over time, causing the rifle to lose its preset range elevation setting. Other modifications included a new stamped cartridge follower; the rounded edges of the new design largely alleviated the &quot;fourth-round jam&quot; complaints of the earlier machined part. All stock furniture was also redesigned in stamped metal.

In late 1942, Smith-Corona Typewriter Company began production of the M1903A3 at its plant in Syracuse, New York. Smith-Corona parts are mostly identified by the absence of markings, except for occasions when time permitting during manufacture, on early to mid-production rifles, and also only on certain parts.

To speed up production output, two-groove rifled barrels were adopted, and steel alloy specifications were relaxed under &quot;war emergency steel&quot; criteria for both rifle actions and barrels. All M1903A3 rifles with two-groove &quot;war emergency&quot; barrels were shipped with a printed notation stating that the reduction in rifling grooves did not affect accuracy. As the war progressed, various machining and finishing operations were eliminated on the M1903A3 in order to increase production levels.

Original production rifles at Remington and Smith-Corona had a dark gray-black finish similar to the bluing of late World War I. Beginning in late 1943 a lighter gray-green parkerizing finish was used. This later finish was also used on arsenal repaired weapons.

It is somewhat unusual to find a World War I or early World War II M1903 with its original dated barrel. Most, if not all, World War II .30-06 ammunition used a corrosive primer which left corrosive salts in the barrel. If not removed by frequent and proper barrel cleaning, these residues could cause pitting and excessive wear. Cleaning was sometimes lax when fighting in the jungle on various Pacific islands, and the higher moisture levels compounded the corrosive action of the residue.

The M1903 and the M1903A3 rifles were used in combat alongside the M1 Garand by the US military during World War II and saw extensive use and action in the hands of US troops in Europe, North Africa, and the Pacific. The US Marines were initially armed with M1903 rifles in early battles in the Pacific, such as the Battle of Guadalcanal, but the jungle battle environment generally favored self-loading rifles; later Army units arriving to the island were armed with M1 Garands. The U.S. Army Rangers were also a major user of the M1903 and the M1903A3 during World War II with the Springfield being preferred over the M1 Garand for certain commando missions. 

According to Bruce Canfield&#x27;s &quot;U.S. Infantry Weapons of WW II&quot;, final variants of the M1903 (the A3 and A4) were delivered in February 1944. By then, most American combat troops had been re-equipped with the M1 Garand. However, some front-line infantry units in both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps retained M1903s as infantry rifles beyond that date and continued to use them alongside the M1 Garand until the end of the war in 1945. The Springfield remained in service for snipers (using the &quot;M1903A4&quot;), grenadiers (using a spigot type rifle 22 mm with the M1 grenade launcher until the M7 grenade launcher was available for the M1 rifle in late 1943), and Marine scout sniper units.

==== Sniper rifle====

The M1903A4 was the U.S. Army&#x27;s sniper rifle of choice during the Second World War. The M1903A4 was a variation of the M1903A3. The only difference between receivers was that the model and serial number on the receiver were split on M1903A4 to make room for the Redfield scope mount. The Redfield scope mount removed the rear peep sight that was standard on the M1903A3. The scope used on the M1903A4 was a Weaver Model 330 or 330C, which was a 2.75x telescopic sight. The receivers were tested by Remington Arms and those that were deemed best, meaning those closest to design specifications were selected to become M1903A4s. The barrels were also selected specifically to be added to the M1903A4 rifle only if they were within almost exact specifications for the design. The front sight on the barrel was never installed on the A4 barrels, however, the notch for it was still in place. Barrel specifications were, in general, unchanged between the M1903A3 and M1903A4, however, the War Department did start installing barrels with 2 groove rifling instead of 4 groove, despite the lack of clear changes from the 4 groove rifling that was the standard up until 1942.

By some accounts, the M1903A4 was inadequate as a sniper rifle. The M1903A4 was a relatively accurate rifle with an effective range of about . These limitations on long-range targeting were due to the limited field of view present in both the Weaver scopes. From its adoption in 1943 until the end of the war it was used extensively in every theater of operation by both the US Army and the USMC. The Weaver scopes (later standardized as the M73 and M73B1) were not only low-powered in magnification, they were not waterproofed, and frequently fogged over or became waterlogged during humidity changes. In addition, the M81/82 optional scopes also had significant flaws. They most notably had less power (2.2x vs. 2.75x) and, like the other scopes on the M1903A4, had serious issues with the field of view. The USMC and the US Army would eventually switch to a large 8x scope that spanned the length of the rifle designed by John Unertl.

==== Foreign users====
The US Army Military Police (MP) and the US Navy Shore Patrol also used M1903s and M1903A3s throughout the war. Various US allies and friendly irregular forces were also equipped with the weapon. The Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB), operating in the 5th Army in Italy, was equipped with M1903 rifles. In August 1943, the Free French Forces of General Charles de Gaulle were re-equipped by the United States, primarily with M1903 Springfield and M1917 Enfield rifles. The M1903 became one of the primary rifles used by French forces until the end of the war, and was afterwards used in Indochina and by local militia and security forces in French Algeria. Large numbers of M1903 rifles were sent to China.
During the Korean War, South Korean Marines used the M1903A3. 
The M1903 rifles captured by the Germans were designated &quot;Gewehr 249(a)&quot;.

===Korean War===
The M1903A4 was slowly phased out during the Korean war by the Army, but saw extensive use in the Marine Corps in the form of the M1941 Sniper rifle. This new rifle was simply equipped with a very long and powerful Unertl 7.8x (as compared to the M73B1 2.5X telescopic sights issued with the army&#x27;s M1903A4) variant type scope. It was used in situations when the range to the target simply exceeded that of the Marines&#x27; M1C and M1D sniper rifles, which were effective to about . In some rare cases, kills from up to were reported by Marines using the M1941 sniper rifles. Marine Corps armorers continued to rebuild some M1903 sniper rifles as late as the early stages of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.

===Post–Korean War service===
After the Korean War, active service (as opposed to drill) use of the M1903 was rare. Still, some M1903A4s remained in sniper use as late as the Vietnam War; and technical manuals for them were printed as late as 1970. The U.S. Navy also continued to carry some stocks of M1903A3s on board ships for use as anti-mine rifles.

===Today===
Due to its balance, the M1903 is still popular with various military drill teams and color guards, most notably the U.S. Army Drill Team. M1903 rifles (along with the M1 Garand, M1917 Enfield and M14 rifles) are also common at high school Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) units to teach weapons handling and military drill procedures to the cadets. JROTC units use M1903s for regular and inter-school competition drills, including elaborate exhibition spinning routines. Exhibition teams often use fiberglass stocks in place of wooden stocks, which are heavier and more prone to breakage when dropped. JROTC Color Guards still favor wooden stocks over fiberglass because of their weight characteristics and appearance. The M1903 is the standard parade rifle of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, which has over six hundred M1903s, a very small percentage of which are still fireable. The Summerall Guards of The Citadel also use the M1903 Springfield for their silent drill performances.

U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps color guard rifles bear many similarities to the Springfield.

In 1977, the U.S. Army located a rather large cache of unissued M1903A3 rifles which were demilitarized and then issued to JROTC units as a replacement for their previously issued M1 Garand and M14 rifles, which were then returned to Army custody due to concerns about potential break-ins at high school JROTC armories.

For safety reasons, the JROTC M1903s are made permanently unable to fire by plugging the barrel with a steel rod, or having it filled with lead, soldering the bolt and welding the magazine cutoff switch in the &quot;on&quot; position. To plug the barrel, a very cold steel rod was inserted; after it warmed up it was too tight to remove.

==Specifications==
The US rifle, Model of 1903 is long and weighs . A bayonet can be attached; the M1905 bayonet blade is long and weighs . From 1906, the rifle was chambered to fire the .30 caliber M1906 cartridge (.30-06 cartridge), later the M1 (1926) and M2 ball (1938) rounds. There were four standard types of cartridge:

* &quot;Ball&quot;: consists of a brass case or shell, primer, a charge of smokeless powder, and the bullet. The bullet has a sharp point called a spitzer, and is composed of a lead core and a jacket of cupro-nickel (later gilding metal), and in the M1906 design, weighs 150 grains (9.7 g). The bullet of the M1906 cartridge, when fired from the rifle, has an initial velocity of .
* &quot;Blank&quot;: contains a paper cup instead of a bullet. It is dangerous up to .
* &quot;Guard&quot;: has a smaller charge of powder than the ball cartridge, and five cannelures encircle the body of the shell at about the middle to distinguish it from ball cartridges. It was intended for use on guard or in riot duty, and it gives good results up to . The range of requires a sight elevation of , and the range of requires an elevation of .
* &quot;Dummy&quot;: this is tin-plated and the shell is provided with six longitudinal corrugations and three circular holes. The primer contains no percussion composition. It was intended for drill purposes to accustom the soldier to the operation of loading the rifle.

The rifle is a magazine-fed clip-loader and can fire at a rate of 20 shots per minute. Each stripper clip contains five cartridges, and standard issue consisted of 12 clips carried in a cloth bandoleer. When full the bandoleer weighs about . Bandoleers were packed 20 in a box, for a total of 1,200 rounds. The full box weighs .

The bore of the rifle is 0.30 inches (7.62 mm) in diameter. It was then rifled 0.004 in (0.1 mm) deep, making the diameter from the bottom of one groove to the bottom of the opposite groove 0.30787 in (7.82 mm) of the barrel.

The M1903 rifle included a rear sight leaf that can be used to adjust for elevation and windage. This type of rear sight was previously designed by Adelbert R. Buffington of the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. The M1905 rear sight was calibrated to match the trajectory of M1906 service ammunition and offers several sighting options. When the leaf and slider are down, the battle sight notch appears on top. This was set for for the down position of the slide, and is not adjustable. When the leaf is raised its range slider can be adjusted to a maximum range of . The .30-06 Springfield M1906 service ammunition long-range performance was originally overstated. When the M1906 cartridge was developed, the range tests had been done to only ; distances beyond that were estimated, but the estimate for extreme range was wrong by almost 40 percent. The external ballistic discrepancy at long-ranges became evident during World War I. The M1905 rear sight can also be adjusted for windage.

The M1903A3 introduced a ramp-type rear aperture sight adjustable both for elevation and windage. It can be adjusted from . This new sightline also lengthened the sight radius.

A feature inherent to the M1903 and not found on the Mauser M98 is the cocking piece, a conspicuous knob at the rear of the bolt, allowing the rifle&#x27;s striker to be released without dry firing, or to cock the rifle if necessary, for example to attempt a second strike on a round that failed to fire. This was implemented from the U.S. model of the Krag–Jørgensen rifle.

==Variants==

There were four main variants given official nomenclature, though there are a number of important sub-variants:

*&quot;M1903 (1903)&quot;: developed for the .30-03 (also known as the .30-45) cartridge. Used original Type S stock.
**&quot;M1903 bullpup (1903)&quot;: experimental bullpup conversion for the USMC. 
**&quot;M1903 (1905)&quot;: changed from a rod type bayonet to the knife type Model 1905 bayonet and to the improved Model 1905 sight.
**&quot;M1903 (1906)&quot;: modified again to specifically fire the new M1906 .30-06 cartridge (&quot;ball cartridge, caliber 30, Model of 1906&quot;).
**&quot;M1903 NRA (1915–1917)&quot;: sold to National Rifle Association members and stamped &quot;NRA&quot; on the forward tang of the trigger guard.
**&quot;M1903 air service (1918)&quot;: issued to aircrew with permanent 25-round magazine and modified Type S stock forend designed as backup if a plane&#x27;s machine gun jammed in combat.
**&quot;M1903 Mark I (1918–1920)&quot;: modified with an ejection port on the left side of the receiver for specific use with the Pedersen device.
**&quot;M1903 NM (1921–1940)&quot;: selected rifles produced at Springfield Armory for National Match shooting competition. Production barrels were measured with star-gauges, and those meeting specified tolerances were stamped with an asterisk shaped star on the muzzle crown. These barrels were fitted to selected receivers with hand-fitted and polished parts. The bolt was left unblued while the receiver and barrel were finished with a black Parkerizing process. Some bolts have the safety direction reversed to prevent it from striking the nose of a right-handed shooter and those made from 1924 to 1929 have the knurled cocking piece removed to decrease lock time. Early rifles used the type S stock until the type C stock became standard in 1929. Rifles made for sale to NRA members (priced at $40.44) were drilled and tapped for a Lyman 48 receiver sight and had either a type B (or NB) stock with no grasping grooves and a noticeable drop at the heel for a long pistol grip, or a special National Match stock with a high comb and pistol grip. Total production was 28,907. Most were issued to service teams and 25,377 were reconditioned at Springfield Armory after one year of match use. Reconditioned rifles have a large gas-escape port drilled into the left side of the receiver.
**&quot;M1903 Bushmaster carbine (1940s)&quot;: the barrel and stock were cut down to for easier use in Panama; 4,725 such rifles were made. It was a training rifle and saw no action. After World War II most were dumped into the ocean and surviving pieces are rare.
**&quot;M1903 with &quot;scant&quot; stock (1942)&quot;: in late 1941, before the M1903A3 was standardized, Army ordnance wanted to standardize on a pistol-grip stock for all M1903 rifles. There were thousands of stock blanks that had been sized for the old straight stock. They were not deep enough for the full pistol grip of the Type C stock, so they were modified to allow a &quot;scant&quot; grip that was the largest grip they could form. These &quot;scant&quot; stocks would only fit on a M1903, and would not fit an 03A3. Springfield only rebuilt existing M1903 rifles using this stock in 1942 and marked the cut-off seat with a small &quot;s&quot;.

*&quot;M1903A1 (1929–1939)&quot;: changed from a straight stock to a pistol grip type stock (Type C stock). The pistol grip stock was conducive to improved marksmanship and was fitted to National Match rifles until World War II. Pistol grip stocks became standard for later M1903 production and were subsequently fitted to older rifles. The Army considered any rifle with a pistol grip stock an M1903A1, but M1903 receiver markings were unchanged.
*&quot;M1903A2 (1930s–1940s)&quot;: basically a stripped A1 or A3 used as a subcaliber rifle with artillery pieces.
*&quot;M1903A3 (1942–1944)&quot;: sights were changed to an aperture (peep) system mounted on the receiver, and the rifle was modified for easier production with stamped metal parts and somewhat different grip and stock (late model Type S stock; no finger grooves).
**&quot;M1903 (modified) (1941–1942)&quot;: transition production of M1903 rifles by Remington Arms until the M1903A3 design was implemented involved modification of various parts creating a hybrid between the M1903 and M1903A3.
*&quot;M1903A4 (1942)&quot;: an M1903A3 modified to be a sniper rifle using an M73 or M73B1 2.5× Weaver telescopic sight and different stock, and omitting the iron sights. USMC versions instead used the 8x Unertl scope.

There are two main other types, various training types, and competition versions such as the National Match types. Aside from these there are some other civilian versions, experimental versions, and other miscellaneous types. Due to the duration of its service, there is also a range of smaller differences among ones from different periods and manufacturers.

In military use it was outnumbered by the M1917 Enfield for much of the war. Also, during World War II many remained in use early on, especially in the Pacific (generally replaced as M1s became available), in addition to service (along with other weapons) as a sniper rifle and to launch rifle grenades.

*&quot;Bannerman Springfield&quot;: After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Scottish-born military surplus magnate Francis Bannerman VI assembled 1,000 M1903 rifles from surplus parts which were rebored to accept .303 British ammunition. He presented these to the British Army together with bayonets, pouches and webbing as a patriotic gesture. However, the conversion was not a success and it was found that rimmed .303 cartridges would not feed properly from the magazine. The rifles were stamped &quot;DP,&quot; i.e., fit for &quot;drill purposes&quot; only, and presented to the City of London&#x27;s Volunteer Training Corps, who were otherwise without any weapons.

==In popular culture==
Ernest Hemingway used an M1903 to shoot big game, including lions, on his first African safari in 1933. His experiences during the safari is the subject of &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;, published in 1935.

An M1903A4 is used by Private Daniel Jackson in the film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.

<doc id="397237" wikidata="Q19742991" url="?curid=397237" title="International Air Transport Association code">
<text>IATA codes are abbreviations that the International Air Transport Association (IATA) publishes to facilitate air travel. They are typically 1, 2, 3, or 4 character combinations (referred to as unigrams, digrams, trigrams, or s, respectively) that uniquely identify locations, equipment, companies, and times to standardize international flight operations. All codes within each group follow a pattern (same number of characters, and using either all letters or letter/digit combinations) to reduce the potential for error.

== Airport codes ==
IATA airport codes are trigram letter designations for airports, like &quot;ORY&quot; (Paris-Orly Airport), &quot;CPT&quot; (Cape Town International Airport), OTP (Otopeni International Airport) and &quot;BCN&quot; (Barcelona-El Prat).

== Airline designators ==
IATA airline designators are digram letter/digit codes for airline companies, like &quot;M6&quot; (Amerijet), &quot;NH&quot; (All Nippon Airways), and &quot;4A&quot; (Air Kiribati).

== Aircraft type designators ==

IATA aircraft type designators are trigram letter/digit codes used for aircraft models, like &quot;J41&quot; (British Aerospace Jetstream 41) and &quot;744&quot; (Boeing 747-400).

== Country codes ==
Digram letter codes are used for countries as specified in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. One additional code is used:
* code XU is used to specify part of Russia east of (but not including) the Ural Mountains.

== Currency codes ==
Trigram letter codes are used for currencies as specified in ISO 4217.

== IATA time zone codes ==
IATA time zone is a country or a part of a country, where local time is the same. IATA time zone code is constructed of 2–4 characters (letters and digits) as follows:
* ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code is always used as first and second characters of time zone code.
* If country is not divided into separate time zones – no more characters added. Just 2 characters used.
* If country is divided into time zones – 3rd character of time zone code is a digit – number of time zone in country. &quot;Note:&quot; Russia is divided into 11 time zones, so number of time zone in country is specified by 2 digits – RU01, RU02, ... RU11.
* If some territories have the same local time, but different rules on daylight saving time – a letter can be added as 4th character to make unique codes for all such territories. 

&quot;Example&quot;: Time zone code AU2 is used for Australian states New South Wales and Victoria (local time is UTC + 10 hours, DST begins at end of October). Time zone code AU2A is used for Tasmania (local time is UTC + 10 hours, DST begins at end of September). Time zone code AU2B is used for Queensland (local time is UTC + 10 hours, no DST).

== IATA region codes ==
IATA region codes trigram letters codes used to specify large territories, consisting of several countries.

Following codes are used:

* AFR - Africa
* CAR - Caribbean Sea countries
* CEM - Central America
* EUR - Europe
* TC1 - IATA American Traffic Conference (includes NOA, CEM, SOA and CAR)
* TC3 - IATA Asian Traffic Conference (includes JAK, SAS, SEA, SWP)
* TC2 - IATA European and African Traffic Conference (includes AFR, EUR, MDE)
* JAK - Japan and Korea
* MDE - Middle East
* NOA - North America
* SCH - Schengen agreement countries
* SOA - South America
* SAS - South Asia
* SEA - South-Eastern Asia
* SWP - South-West Pacific

Speaking on region codes and countries, country code RU is used to specify part of Russia west from (and including of) Ural Mountains and country code XU is used to specify part of Russia east from (and not including of) Ural Mountains. Country RU is in EUR region, country XU is in SEA region. For all other purposes only country code RU is used to specify all the territory of Russia.

Country code AQ is used to specify Antarctica. Country AQ is not in any of regions listed here.

<doc id="397245" wikidata="Q140637" url="?curid=397245" title="Numeracy">
<text>Numeracy is the ability to understand, reason with, and apply simple numerical concepts; it is the numerical counterpart of literacy. The charity National Numeracy states: &quot;Numeracy means understanding how mathematics is used in the real world and being able to apply it to make the best possible decisions...It&#x27;s as much about thinking and reasoning as about &#x27;doing sums&#x27;&quot;. Basic numeracy skills consist of comprehending fundamental arithmetical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, if one can understand simple mathematical equations such as 2 + 2 = 4, then one would be considered to possess at least basic numeric knowledge. Substantial aspects of numeracy also include number sense, operation sense, computation, measurement, geometry, probability and statistics. A numerically literate person can manage and respond to the mathematical demands of life.

By contrast, innumeracy (the lack of numeracy) can have a negative impact. Numeracy has an influence on healthy behaviors, financial literacy, and career decisions. Therefore, innumeracy may negatively affect economic choices, financial outcomes, health outcomes, and life satisfaction. It also may distort risk perception in health decisions. Greater numeracy has been associated with reduced susceptibility to framing effects, less influence of nonnumerical information such as mood states, and greater sensitivity to different levels of numerical risk. Ellen Peters and her colleagues argue that achieving the benefits of numeric literacy, however, may depend on one&#x27;s numeric self-efficacy or confidence in one&#x27;s skills.

==Representation of numbers==
Humans have evolved to mentally represent numbers in two major ways from observation (not formal math). These representations are often thought to be innate (see Numerical cognition), to be shared across human cultures, to be common to multiple species, and not to be the result of individual learning or cultural transmission. They are:
# Approximate representation of numerical magnitude, and
# Precise representation of the quantity of individual items.

Approximate representations of numerical magnitude imply that one can relatively estimate and comprehend an amount if the number is large (see Approximate number system). For example, one experiment showed children and adults arrays of many dots. After briefly observing them, both groups could accurately estimate the approximate number of dots. However, distinguishing differences between large numbers of dots proved to be more challenging.

Precise representations of distinct items demonstrate that people are more accurate in estimating amounts and distinguishing differences when the numbers are relatively small (see Subitizing). For example, in one experiment, an experimenter presented an infant with two piles of crackers, one with two crackers the other with three. The experimenter then covered each pile with a cup. When allowed to choose a cup, the infant always chose the cup with more crackers because the infant could distinguish the difference.

Both systems—approximate representation of magnitude and precise representation quantity of individual items—have limited power. For example, neither allows representations of fractions or negative numbers. More complex representations require education. However, achievement in school mathematics correlates with an individual&#x27;s unlearned approximate number sense.

==Definitions and assessment==
Fundamental (or rudimentary) numeracy skills include understanding of the real number line, time, measurement, and estimation. Fundamental skills include basic skills (the ability to identify and understand numbers) and computational skills (the ability to perform simple arithmetical operations and compare numerical magnitudes).

More sophisticated numeracy skills include understanding of ratio concepts (notably fractions, proportions, percentages, and probabilities), and knowing when and how to perform multistep operations. Two categories of skills are included at the higher levels: the analytical skills (the ability to understand numerical information, such as required to interpret graphs and charts) and the statistical skills (the ability to apply higher probabilistic and statistical computation, such as conditional probabilities).

A variety of tests have been developed for assessing numeracy and health numeracy. Different tests have been developed to evaluate health numeracy. Two of these tests that have been found to be &quot;reliable and valid&quot; are the GHNT-21 and GHNT-6.

==Childhood influences==
The first couple of years of childhood are considered to be a vital part of life for the development of numeracy and literacy. There are many components that play key roles in the development of numeracy at a young age, such as Socioeconomic Status (SES), parenting, Home Learning Environment (HLE), and age.

==Socioeconomic status==
Children who are brought up in families with high SES tend to be more engaged in developmentally enhancing activities. These children are more likely to develop the necessary abilities to learn and to become more motivated to learn. More specifically, a mother&#x27;s education level is considered to have an effect on the child&#x27;s ability to achieve in numeracy. That is, mothers with a high level of education will tend to have children who succeed more in numeracy.

A number of studies have, moreover, proved that the education level of the mother is strongly correlated with the average age of getting married. More precisely, females who entered the marriage later, tend to have greater autonomy, chances for skills premium and level of education (i.e. numeracy). Hence, they were more likely to share this experience with children.

==Parenting==
Parents are advised to collaborate with their child in simple learning exercises, such as reading a book, painting, drawing, and playing with numbers. On a more expressive note, the act of using complex language, being more responsive towards the child, and establishing warm interactions are recommended to parents with the confirmation of positive numeracy outcomes. When discussing beneficial parenting behaviors, a feedback loop is formed because pleased parents are more willing to interact with their child, which in essence promotes better development in the child.

==Home-learning environment==
Along with parenting and SES, a strong home-learning environment increases the likelihood of the child being prepared for comprehending complex mathematical schooling. For example, if a child is influenced by many learning activities in the household, such as puzzles, coloring books, mazes, or books with picture riddles, then they will be more prepared to face school activities.

==Age==
Age is accounted for when discussing the development of numeracy in children. Children under the age of 5 have the best opportunity to absorb basic numeracy skills. After the age of seven, achievement of basic numeracy skills become less influential. For example, a study was conducted to compare the reading and mathematical abilities between children of ages five and seven, each in three different mental capacity groups (underachieving, average, and overachieving). The differences in the amount of knowledge retained were greater between the three different groups aged five than between the groups aged seven. This reveals that those of younger ages have an opportunity to retain more information, like numeracy. According to Gelman and Gallistel in The Child&#x27;s Understanding of Number, &#x27;children as young as 2 years can accurately judge numerosity provided that the numerosity is not larger than two or three&#x27;. Children as young as three have been found to understand elementary mathematical concepts. Kilpatrick and his colleagues state &#x27;most preschoolers show that they can understand and perform simple addition and subtraction by at least 3 years of age&#x27;. Lastly, it has been observed that pre-school children benefit from their basic understanding of &#x27;counting, reading and writing of numbers, understanding of simple addition and subtraction, numerical reasoning, classifying of objects and shapes, estimating, measuring, [and the] reproduction of number patterns&#x27;.

==Literacy==
There seems to be a relationship between literacy and numeracy, which can be seen in young children. Depending on the level of literacy or numeracy at a young age, one can predict the growth of literacy and/ or numeracy skills in future development. There is some evidence that humans may have an inborn sense of number. In one study for example, five-month-old infants were shown two dolls, which were then hidden with a screen. The babies saw the experimenter pull one doll from behind the screen. Without the child&#x27;s knowledge, a second experimenter could remove, or add dolls, unseen behind the screen. When the screen was removed, the infants showed more surprise at an unexpected number (for example, if there were still two dolls). Some researchers have concluded that the babies were able to count, although others doubt this and claim the infants noticed surface area rather than number.

==Employment==
Numeracy has a huge impact on employment. In a work environment, numeracy can be a controlling factor affecting career achievements and failures. Many professions require individuals to have well-developed numerical skills: for example, mathematician, physicist, accountant, actuary, financial analyst, engineer, and architect. This is why a major target of the UN&#x27;s Sustainable Development Goal 4 is to substantially increase the number of youths who have relevant skills for decent work and employment because, even outside these specialized areas, the lack of numeracy skills can reduce employment opportunities and promotions, resulting in unskilled manual careers, low-paying jobs, and even unemployment. For example, carpenters and interior designers need to be able to measure, use fractions, and handle budgets. Another example of numeracy influencing employment was demonstrated at the Poynter Institute. The Poynter Institute has recently included numeracy as one of the skills required by competent journalists. Max Frankel, former executive editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, argues that &quot;deploying numbers skillfully is as important to communication as deploying verbs&quot;. Unfortunately, it is evident that journalists often show poor numeracy skills. In a study by the Society of Professional Journalists, 58% of job applicants interviewed by broadcast news directors lacked an adequate understanding of statistical materials.

To assess job applicants, psychometric numerical reasoning tests have been created by occupational psychologists, who are involved in the study of numeracy. These tests are used to assess ability to comprehend and apply numbers. They are sometimes administered with a time limit, so that the test-taker must think quickly and concisely. Research has shown that these tests are very useful in evaluating potential applicants because they do not allow the applicants to prepare for the test, unlike interview questions. This suggests that an applicant&#x27;s results are reliable and accurate

These tests first became prevalent during the 1980s, following the pioneering work of psychologists, such as P. Kline, who published a book in 1986 entitled &quot;A handbook of test construction: Introduction to psychometric design&quot;, which explained that psychometric testing could provide reliable and objective results, which could be used to assess a candidate&#x27;s numerical abilities.

==Innumeracy and dyscalculia==
The term &quot;innumeracy&quot; is a neologism, coined by analogy with illiteracy. &quot;Innumeracy&quot; refers to a lack of ability to reason with numbers. The term was coined by cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter; however, it was popularized in 1989 by mathematician John Allen Paulos in his book &quot;Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences&quot;.

Developmental dyscalculia refers to a persistent and specific impairment of basic numerical-arithmetical skills learning in the context of normal intelligence.

==Patterns and differences==
The root causes of innumeracy vary. Innumeracy has been seen in those suffering from poor education and childhood deprivation of numeracy. Innumeracy is apparent in children during the transition between numerical skills obtained before schooling and the new skills taught in the education departments because of their memory capacity to comprehend the material. Patterns of innumeracy have also been observed depending on age, gender, and race. Older adults have been associated with lower numeracy skills than younger adults. Men have been identified to have higher numeracy skills than women. Some studies seem to indicate young people of African heritage tend to have lower numeracy skills. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in which children at fourth-grade (average 10 to 11 years) and eighth-grade (average 14 to 15 years) from 49 countries were tested on mathematical comprehension. The assessment included tests for number, algebra (also called patterns and relationships at fourth grade), measurement, geometry, and data. The latest study, in 2003, found that children from Singapore at both grade levels had the highest performance. Countries like Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and Taiwan also shared high levels of numeracy. The lowest scores were found in countries like South Africa, Ghana, and Saudi Arabia. Another finding showed a noticeable difference between boys and girls, with some exceptions. For example, girls performed significantly better in Singapore, and boys performed significantly better in the United States.

==Theory==
There is a theory that innumeracy is more common than illiteracy when dividing cognitive abilities into two separate categories. David C. Geary, a notable cognitive developmental and evolutionary psychologist from the University of Missouri, created the terms &quot;biological primary abilities&quot; and &quot;biological secondary abilities&quot;. Biological primary abilities evolve over time and are necessary for survival. Such abilities include speaking a common language or knowledge of simple mathematics. Biological secondary abilities are attained through personal experiences and cultural customs, such as reading or high level mathematics learned through schooling. Literacy and numeracy are similar in the sense that they are both important skills used in life. However, they differ in the sorts of mental demands each makes. Literacy consists of acquiring vocabulary and grammatical sophistication, which seem to be more closely related to memorization, whereas numeracy involves manipulating concepts, such as in calculus or geometry, and builds from basic numeracy skills. This could be a potential explanation of the challenge of being numerate.

==Innumeracy and risk perception in health decision-making==
Health numeracy has been defined as &quot;the degree to which individuals have the capacity to access, process, interpret, communicate, and act on numerical, quantitative, graphical, biostatistical, and probabilistic health information needed to make effective health decisions&quot;. The concept of health numeracy is a component of the concept of health literacy. Health numeracy and health literacy can be thought of as the combination of skills needed for understanding risk and making good choices in health-related behavior.

Health numeracy requires basic numeracy but also more advanced analytical and statistical skills. For instance, health numeracy also requires the ability to understand probabilities or relative frequencies in various numerical and graphical formats, and to engage in Bayesian inference, while avoiding errors sometimes associated with Bayesian reasoning (see Base rate fallacy, Conservatism (Bayesian)). Health numeracy also requires understanding terms with definitions that are specific to the medical context. For instance, although &#x27;survival&#x27; and &#x27;mortality&#x27; are complementary in common usage, these terms are not complementary in medicine (see five-year survival rate). Innumeracy is also a very common problem when dealing with risk perception in health-related behavior; it is associated with patients, physicians, journalists and policymakers. Those who lack or have limited health numeracy skills run the risk of making poor health-related decisions because of an inaccurate perception of information. For example, if a patient has been diagnosed with breast cancer, being innumerate may hinder her ability to comprehend her physician&#x27;s recommendations, or even the severity of the health concern or even the likelihood of treatment benefits. One study found that people tended to overestimate their chances of survival or even to choose lower-quality hospitals. Innumeracy also makes it difficult or impossible for some patients to read medical graphs correctly. Some authors have distinguished graph literacy from numeracy. Indeed, many doctors exhibit innumeracy when attempting to explain a graph or statistics to a patient. A misunderstanding between a doctor and patient, due to either the doctor, patient, or both being unable to comprehend numbers effectively, could result in serious harm to health.

Different presentation formats of numerical information, for instance natural frequency icon arrays, have been evaluated to assist both low-numeracy and high-numeracy individuals. Other data formats provide more assistance to low-numeracy people.

==Evolution of numeracy==
In the field of economic history, numeracy is often used to assess human capital at times when there was no data on schooling or other educational measures. Using a method called age-heaping, researchers like Professor Jörg Baten study the development and inequalities of numeracy over time and throughout regions. For example, Baten and Hippe find a numeracy gap between regions in western and central Europe and the rest of Europe for the period 1790–1880. At the same time, their data analysis reveals that these differences as well as within country inequality decreased over time. Taking a similar approach, Baten and Fourie find overall high levels of numeracy for people in the Cape Colony (late 17th to early 19th century).

In contrast to these studies comparing numeracy over countries or regions, it is also possible to analyze numeracy within countries. For example, Baten, Crayen and Voth look at the effects of war on numeracy in England, and Baten and Priwitzer find a &quot;military bias&quot; in what is today western Hungary: people opting for a military career had - on average - better numeracy indicators (1 BCE to 3CE).

<text>The Sri Lanka men&#x27;s national cricket team, (; ) nicknamed The Lions, represents Sri Lanka in men&#x27;s international cricket. It is a full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One-Day International (ODI) and T20 International (T20I) status. The team first played first class cricket (as Ceylon) in 1926–27 and became an associate member of the ICC in 1965. They made their international debut in the 1975 Cricket World Cup and were later awarded the Test status in 1981, which made Sri Lanka the eighth Test cricket-playing nation. The team is administered by Sri Lanka Cricket.

Sri Lanka&#x27;s national cricket team achieved considerable success beginning in the 1990s, rising from underdog status to winning the Cricket World Cup in 1996, under the captaincy of Arjuna Ranatunga. Since then, the team has continued to be a force in international cricket. The Sri Lankan cricket team reached the finals of the 2007 and 2011 Cricket World Cups consecutively. They ended up being runners-up on both occasions.

Sri Lanka won the Cricket World Cup in 1996 (vs Australia), the ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 (co-champions with India), and the ICC T20 World Cup in 2014 (vs India). They have been consecutive runners-up in the 2007 and 2011 Cricket World Cups, and have been runners-up in the ICC T20 World Cup in 2009 and 2012. The Sri Lankan cricket team currently holds several world records, including the world record for the highest team total in Test cricket.

== History ==
===Early Years===
Cricket was introduced to the island by the British as a result of the colonization and the first recorded match dates back to 1832 as reported in &quot;The Colombo Journal&quot;. By the 1880s a national team, the Ceylon national cricket team, was formed which began playing first-class cricket by the 1920s. The Ceylon national cricket team achieved Associate Member status of the International Cricket Council in 1965. Renamed Sri Lanka in 1972, the national team first competed in top-level international cricket in 1975, when they were defeated by nine wickets by the West Indies during the 1975 Cricket World Cup at Old Trafford, England.

===Underdog Era===
Sri Lanka was awarded Test cricket status in 1981 by the International Cricket Conference. They played their first Test match against England at P. Saravanamuttu Stadium, Colombo, on 17 February 1982. Bandula Warnapura was the captain for Sri Lanka in that match, which England won by 7 wickets. After Sri Lanka was awarded Test status on 21 July 1981 as eighth Test playing nation, they had to wait until 6 September 1985, where Sri Lanka recorded their first Test win by beating India, in the second match of the series by 149 runs at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium, Colombo. They have also won the 2001-02 Asian Test Championship, defeating Pakistan in the final by an innings and 175 runs.

Sri Lanka won their first Test match under the leadership of Duleep Mendis on 11 September 1985 against India, winning by 149 runs at P. Saravanamuttu Stadium. Eventually they won the three-match Test series, 1–0. Sri Lanka had to wait more than seven years for their next series victory, which came against New Zealand in December 1992, when they won the two-match series 1–0. This was immediately followed by a one-wicket victory against England in a one-Test series.

Two years later, on 15 March 1995, Sri Lanka won their first overseas Test match under the leadership of Arjuna Ranatunga against New Zealand, when they beat them by 241 runs at Napier. This win also resulted in their first overseas Test series victory, 1–0. Their next series too was an overseas series, against Pakistan, and that one too resulted in Sri Lankan victory.

Sri Lanka registered their first ODI win against India at Old Trafford, England on 16 June 1979.

=== Modern era ===

After many years of underdog status, Sri Lanka finally entered the limelight of the cricketing world after winning the 1996 Cricket World Cup under the captaincy of Arjuna Ranatunga. Meanwhile, they revolutionized modern day batting strategies by rapid scoring during the first 15 overs. Sri Lanka later became the co-champions in 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and also became six times Asian champions in 1986, 1997, 2004, 2008, 2014 and 2022.

On 11 September 1999, under the leadership of Sanath Jayasuriya, Sri Lanka won their first Test match against Australia, when they beat them by six wickets at Asgiriya Stadium, Kandy. Eventually they won the three-match Test series, 1–0.

On 14 June 2000, Sri Lanka played their 100th Test match. It was against Pakistan, at SSC, Colombo, under the leadership of Sanath Jayasuriya. Pakistan won by 5 wickets.
On 4 August 2016, they played their 250th Test match when they played Australia in Galle. They won the match by 229 runs, and also won the Warne-Muralidharan trophy for the first time since its inception. On 17 August 2016, under the leadership of Angelo Mathews, Sri Lanka whitewashed Australia 3-0 for the first time in Test cricket.
Until 2017, Sri Lanka had whitewashed Zimbabwe three times, Bangladesh once and Australia once in Test cricket.

Sri Lanka played their first day-night Test match on 6 October 2017 against Pakistan at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Under the captaincy of Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka convincingly won the match by 68 runs and sweep the series 2–0. In the match, Dimuth Karunaratne became the first Sri Lankan to score a fifty, a century and a 150 in a day-night Test. Lahiru Gamage, who debut in the match became the first Sri Lankan to take a wicket in a day-night Test, whereas Dilruwan Perera became the first Sri Lankan to take a five-wicket haul in a day-night Test.

Sri Lanka played their first Twenty20 International (T20I) match at the Rose Bowl, on 15 June 2006, against England, winning the match by 2 runs. In 2014, they won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, defeating India by 6 wickets.
As of July 2018, Sri Lanka have faced nine teams in Test cricket, only recent Test nations Afghanistan and Ireland are missing from their list of opponents, with their most frequent opponent being Pakistan, playing 55 matches against them. Sri Lanka has registered more wins against Pakistan and Bangladesh than any other team, with 14. In ODI matches, Sri Lanka have played against 17 teams; they have played against India most frequently, with a winning percentage of 39.49 in 149 matches. Within usual major ODI nations, Sri Lanka have defeated England on 34 occasions, which is their best record in ODIs. The team have competed against 13 countries in T20Is, and have played 15 matches against New Zealand. Sri Lanka have defeated Australia and West Indies 6 occasions each. Sri Lanka was the best T20I team in the world, where they ranked number one in more than 32 months, and reached World Twenty20 final in three times.

As of 29 January 2024, Sri Lanka have played 313 Test matches; they have won 100 matches, lost 121 matches, and 92 matches were drawn. As of 10 July 2018, Sri Lanka have played 816 ODI matches, winning 376 matches and losing 399; they also tied 5 matches, whilst 36 had no result. As of 10 July 2018, Sri Lanka have played 108 T20I matches and won 54 of them; 52 were lost and 1 tied and 1 no result match as well.

From 8 July 2017 to 23 October 2017, Sri Lanka lost twelve consecutive ODI matches, which is their second-longest losing run in ODIs. In the meantime, Sri Lanka involved 5-0 whitewash in three times against South Africa, India and Pakistan in 2017. And a 3-0 whitewash against the West Indies 3 years later (2020).

On 9 September 2019, Sri Lanka won the T20I series 3–0 against Pakistan in their home under Dasun Shanaka&#x27;s captaincy. It was the first time that Sri Lanka whitewashed Pakistan in a T20I series. In July 2021, Sri Lanka won T20I series against India 2–1, recording their first ever bilateral T20I series win against India.

On 4 March 2022, Sri Lanka played their 300th Test match in Mohali against India. Sri Lanka lost the match by an innings and 222 runs. Amid political turmoil back home, Sri Lanka won the 2022 Asia Cup, defeating Pakistan in the final on 11 September 2022.
On 28 April 2023, Sri Lanka won their 100th Test match against Ireland at Galle. They won the test series 2–0. They became the 8th test nation to reach this milestone.

Sri Lanka cricket was suspended, by the ICC on 10 November 2023 due to the alleged political interference with the cricket administration. The suspension was fully lifted on 28 January 2024.

==Governing body==

Sri Lanka Cricket (formerly the Board for Cricket Control or BCCSL), is the governing body for cricket in Sri Lanka. It operates the Sri Lankan cricket team and first-class cricket within Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka Cricket oversees the progress and handling of the major domestic competitions: the First-class tournament Premier Trophy, the List A tournament Premier Limited Overs Tournament and the Twenty20 Tournament. Sri Lanka Cricket also organises and hosts the Inter-Provincial Cricket Tournament, a competition where five teams take part and represent four different provinces of Sri Lanka.

Most of the regions of Sri Lanka that are rural areas apart from the Capital could not produce successful cricketers to the national and international side yet due to the lack of resources and opportunities while only a few major areas such as Galle, Matara, Kandy, Kurunegala usually produce successful cricketers to the national and international side instead of the capital. So the government is trying to distribute the game within the whole country by organizing some programs such as 2017–18 Super Four Provincial Tournament.

==Team colours==
Similar to other Sri Lankan sports teams, the Sri Lankan national cricket team bears blue and yellow as their colours. The bright blue represents the surrounding ocean, while the golden yellow represents the united island as a whole (depicting the sand).

In Test matches, the team wears cricket whites, with an optional sweater or sweater-vest with a dark blue and blue V-neck for use in cold weather, such as on Australia, England, and New Zealand tours. The Sri Lankan flag is found on the left side of the jersey&#x27;s chest with the Test cap number usually below the flag; helmets are a deep blue and the fielder&#x27;s hat (usually a baseball cap or a wide-brimmed sunhat) is coloured similarly. The sponsor&#x27;s logo is displayed on the right side of the chest and the sleeve with the Sri Lankan Cricket logo is deployed on the left in test cricket.

Sri Lanka&#x27;s One Day and Twenty 20 kits vary from year to year with the team wearing its bright blue colour in various shades from kit to kit with yellow stripes on shoulders and waist. Historically, Sri Lanka&#x27;s kits have had shades of bright blue and golden yellow. In the World Series Cup in 1984–85, Sri Lanka wore yellow uniforms with blue stripes.

For official ICC tournaments such as ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC World Twenty20 and Asia Cup, &quot;SRI LANKA&quot; is written on the front of the jersey in place of the sponsor logo, with the sponsor logo being placed on the sleeve. A remarkable change in the colour of the kit of Sri Lanka can be found during the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 edition in South Africa. The team-coloured with pale silver and the kit has never been seen since then in the team. Since then, the Sri Lankan kit has never changed from the usual brilliant blue colour and very fine yellow stripes. For 2016 ICC World Twenty20, orange and green colours in the flag are also included in the jersey. In 2017 ICC Champions Trophy pool game against India, the kit changed to the mostly yellow coloured shirt with stripes of blue and usual blue trousers.

At the top-right side of the jersey, instead of the logo, there can be seen Sri Lanka&#x27;s flag.

In 2019 for the 2019 Cricket World Cup, the Sri Lankan jersey was made from recycled plastic sea waste from the Sri Lankan coast. On the side of the blue background, there is a drawing of a turtle on the shirt.
However, for non-ICC tournaments and bilateral and tri-nation matches, the sponsor logo features prominently on the front of the shirt.

=== Logo ===
Sri Lanka&#x27;s cricket team&#x27;s logo is a golden lion with a sword bearing on the right arm and the background is bright blue. The name &quot;Sri Lanka Cricket&quot; is written below the lion. It&#x27;s seen on the practice jersey at the top-right side.

In Test cricket, the logo in the cap is slightly changed, where the lion with a sword is surrounded by petals of lotus and then a blue circle surrounds the crest and a yellow circle surrounds the blue circle, present in the coat of arms. This logo is seen on the front of the caps and helmets in ODIs and T20Is.

<text>In computability theory, the theory of real computation deals with hypothetical computing machines using infinite-precision real numbers. They are given this name because they operate on the set of real numbers. Within this theory, it is possible to prove interesting statements such as &quot;The complement of the Mandelbrot set is only partially decidable.&quot;

These hypothetical computing machines can be viewed as idealised analog computers which operate on real numbers, whereas digital computers are limited to computable numbers. They may be further subdivided into differential and algebraic models (digital computers, in this context, should be thought of as topological, at least insofar as their operation on computable reals is concerned). Depending on the model chosen, this may enable real computers to solve problems that are inextricable on digital computers (For example, Hava Siegelmann&#x27;s neural nets can have noncomputable real weights, making them able to compute nonrecursive languages.) or vice versa. (Claude Shannon&#x27;s idealized analog computer can only solve algebraic differential equations, while a digital computer can solve some transcendental equations as well. However this comparison is not entirely fair since in Claude Shannon&#x27;s idealized analog computer computations are immediately done; i.e. computation is done in real time. Shannon&#x27;s model can be adapted to cope with this problem.)

A canonical model of computation over the reals is Blum–Shub–Smale machine (BSS).

If real computation were physically realizable, one could use it to solve NP-complete problems, and even #P-complete problems, in polynomial time. Unlimited precision real numbers in the physical universe are prohibited by the holographic principle and the Bekenstein bound.

<text>Veszprém (; , , , ) is one of the oldest urban areas in Hungary, and a city with county rights. It lies approximately north of the Lake Balaton. It is the administrative center of the county of the same name.

==Etymology==
The city&#x27;s name derives from the West Slavic-language personal name &quot;Bezprem&quot; or &quot;Bezprym&quot; (Proto-Slavic &quot;Bezprěmъ&quot;) which translates literally to &quot;stubborn&quot;, &quot;self-confident, not willing to retreat&quot;. &quot;Besprem&quot; (before 1002), &quot;Vezprem&quot; (1086), &quot;Bezpremensis&quot; (1109). The form &quot;Vezprem&quot; originates in early medieval scribal habits and frequent exchange of &quot;B&quot; and &quot;V&quot; under the influence of the Greek language.

== Location and legend ==
The city can be reached via the M7 highway and Road 8. It can also be reached from Győr via Road 82 and from Székesfehérvár via Road 8. According to a local legend, Veszprém was founded on seven hills. The seven hills are Várhegy (Castle Hill), Benedek-hegy (St. Benedict Hill), Jeruzsálem-hegy (Jerusalem Hill), Temetőhegy (Cemetery Hill), Gulyadomb (Herd Hill), Kálvária-domb (Calvary Hill), and Cserhát.

==History==

&quot;Anonymus Belæ Regis Notarius&quot; (the anonymous notary of King Béla III) wrote that a castle already stood here when the Hungarians first occupied the area. The castle was probably a 9th-century Frankish fortress. The castles of Veszprém, Esztergom and Székesfehérvár, were the earliest Hungarian stone castles, which had already been built during the reign of High Prince Géza, a time when motte castles were much more common.

Veszprém had an important religious role during the struggle to make Christianity the official religion of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary—Stephen I, Grand Prince of the Hungarians, was crowned King in 1000 or 1001, and defeated the armies of his chief opponent, Koppány, near Veszprém. The city became the first episcopal seat of Hungary in 1009 and an archiepiscopal seat in 1993. &quot;Comitatus Veszprém&quot; was one of the earliest historical counties of Hungary.

Veszprém was the favorite city of Queen Gisela, the wife of Stephen I. For centuries, the queens of Hungary were crowned by the bishop of Veszprém. The city is still often called &quot;the city of queens&quot;. In the year 1294 Queen Fenenna confirmed that, at that time, the former Queen Elizabeth had the privilege to collect the donations of the church in the Veszprém County.

Veszprém was among the first Hungarian cities to have a university—students studied law and arts here for several centuries. The university was destroyed by fire in 1276, when Peter I Csák invaded and devastated the Diocese of Veszprém. Veszprém became a university town again in the 20th century.

The town was taken over by the Ottoman Turks during the Hungarian–Ottoman Wars in 1552, but was lost to the Habsburgs in 1566. The Ottomans once again successfully besieged the town in 1593 during the Long Turkish War. The castle was demolished in 1706. Until 1918, &quot;VESZPRIM&quot; (also named &quot;WESZPRIM&quot; and &quot;WESPRIM&quot; near 1850, and &quot;WEISSBRUNN&quot; in German) was part of the Austrian monarchy/Austria-Hungary, Kingdom of Hungary; in Transleithania after the compromise of 1867 in the Kingdom of Hungary. Between 16 August and 4 October 1919, Romanian troops occupied the city under colonel Constantin Neagu and major Alexander Totescu.

During World War II, Veszprém was captured by Soviet troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front on 23 March 1945, in the course of the Vienna Offensive.

The religious affiliation of the citizens has a Catholic majority with 38.9% Roman Catholic and 0.3% Greek Catholic. The Calvinists (7.0%) have the second, the Lutherans (2.1%) the third largest denomination in the city. 20.6% are not religious.

== Politics ==
The current mayor of Veszprém is Gyula Porga (&quot;Fidesz-KDNP&quot;).

The local Municipal Assembly, elected at the 2019 local government elections, is made up of 18 members (1 Mayor, 12 Individual constituencies MEPs and 5 Compensation List MEPs) divided into this political parties and alliances:

== Public transport ==

The city&#x27;s public transportation consists exclusively of buses, which are run by the city-funded company V-Busz. 30 bus lines run throughout the city, including lines 44 and 45 which are night buses. All buses are easily recognizable even from a distance due to their purple livery. Tickets can be purchased on the buses, from ticket machines across the city and at bus stations from the ticket desks. V-Busz took over the city&#x27;s public transportation in 2018 from the regional, state-funded bus company (ÉNYKK) due to a lack of funding and an old rolling stock of buses, some of which were from the mid 80s.

<doc id="397253" wikidata="Q1417708" url="?curid=397253" title="Finncomm Airlines">
<text>Finnish Commuter Airlines Oy, trading as Finncomm Airlines, was a regional airline with its head office on the grounds of Seinäjoki Airport in Ilmajoki, Finland, near Seinäjoki. The carrier operated flights to Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, Romania, Sweden and 16 destinations within Finland from its base at Helsinki Airport. The airline was a member of the European Regions Airline Association. Finncomm Airlines was the largest domestic air carrier in Finland in terms of number of flights.

The company was replaced by Flybe Nordic in 2011 and was rebranded as Nordic Regional Airlines in May 2015.

== History ==
In 1993, Juhani Pakari and his father started Finncomm Airlines as an Air Taxi business flying light aircraft to remote airstrips which other carriers did not serve. Seeking to acquire an Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate (AOC) to begin scheduled flights, Finncomm partnered with Swedish carrier Golden Air in 1999 until Finncomm could receive their own AOC. The original Golden Air fleet consisted of seven Saab 340s and one Saab 2000.

In September 2003, Finncomm received their own AOC and operations began with one Embraer ERJ-145s leased from Swiss International Air Lines. Inaugural services between Helsinki and Stuttgart were followed by flights to Düsseldorf and Oslo with the arrival of a second ERJ-145 from Swiss International Air Lines in April 2005.

At the 2005 Paris Air Show, Finncomm announced a $250 million contract for eight ATR-42-500 aircraft with options for a further eight. With the arrival of the ATR-42 in late November 2005, the airline could begin to retire the Saab fleet inherited from Golden Air.

In 2006, at the Farnborough Air Show, Finncomm signed a contract which converted four of their ATR-42 orders to the larger ATR-72-500. This was further supplemented by the purchase of an additional three ATR-72 aircraft at a list price of $54 million.

In January 2008 the carrier announced another order for a further five ATR-72-500 aircraft with deliveries between 2009 and 2011. Once all the orders have been fulfilled by ATR, Finncomm will become the largest operator of the ATR-500 series in Europe.

On 9 September 2010, Finnair Group announced that they had signed a preliminary agreement to acquire all the aircraft from Finnish Commuter Airlines Oy and 20% of Finncomm Airlines Oy for the total sum of €48 million. On 1 July 2011, Finnair and Flybe announced they were to jointly buy Finncomm for €25 million. The company was renamed Flybe Nordic. 60% of shares were owned by Flybe while Finnair owned 40%.

==Operations==

Finncomm employed over 250 staff and in 2008 the carrier flew 870,000 passengers, an increase of 45% over the previous year despite a tough economic climate. The growth allowed an operating profit of over €9.4 million which was a 9.8% increase over 2007. The airline expected to carry over 1,000,000 passengers in 2009.

Finncomm co-operated with Finnair to provide feeder traffic for Finnair&#x27;s international route network.

The Finnish Civil Aviation Authority (FCAA) ordered some changes to Finncomm&#x27;s operating procedures and temporarily increased their weather minimums in ATR operations following an incident in late 2006. The incident was investigated and some re-training was ordered by FCAA for pilots regarding new operating procedures. Weather restrictions were lifted and normal operations resumed.

Finncomm announced plans to possess 16 ATR-500 series aircraft by the end of 2011, suggesting they planned to convert at least 3 of their options into firm orders.

== Environment ==
Finncomm Airlines mitigated its environmental impact. The carrier utilised a very modern and fuel efficient fleet of ATRs and Embraers which reduced fuel burn and noise. Finncomm commented that the ATR fleet saved 70,000 tonnes of fuel and 200,000 tonnes of in a five-year period over a jet fleet. Furthermore, when aircraft were at an airport overnight, they were placed in heated hangars to reduce the amount of de-icing agent used on the aircraft. Finncomm stated that saved 300,000 litres of anti-ice solvents annually.

<text>Milly-la-Forêt () is a commune in the Essonne department in the Île-de-France region in northern France.

==Geology==
The Forest of Fontainebleau, in the western end of which Milly-la-Forêt lies, is composed of the Oligocene Fontainebleau sands, which are a marine deposit, laid down in an intertidal zone.

==History==
Milly-la-Forêt is the probable birthplace of Wulfram of Sens, Saint Wulfram; in about 640.

==Origin of the place name==
The first name of this domaine was called Maurillac in Gaul, Mauriliaco on a Merovingien coin, became Maureliacum, Melliacum in 667, Milliacum in Latin. The place name Milly is relatively current; it refers to an antic presence of a villa rustica owned during the Gallo-Romaine era by a certain Milius or Emilius. Hereby, the name was imported in 1080 by the knight Adam de Milly, originally from Milly-en-Beauvaisis and first lord of the place. But a charter dated from 651 mentioned already the name Melliacus. In the 13th century more accuracy was added to the place, Miliacum in Gastineto in 1267, which gave the name Milly-en-Gâtinais without being official. Upon a request from the municipal council and by a statutory order from 6 February 1948, the name was replaced by Milly-la-Forêt, considered at that time as the most touristic place and to differentiate it from its homonym Milly in Normandy.

==Population==
==The village==

Milly contains several facilities: such as the Collège Jean Rostand, the Conservatoire des Deux Vallées, a gymnasium and sports ground complex, a multimedia library, a swimming pool, a bus station, dealers in craft products and so on. There is a market every Thursday in the very impressive late medieval market hall, built in 1479.

The yearly calendar includes attic-clearing sales; at the opening of the summer holiday period, the town celebrates &quot;la Saint-Pierre&quot;, a fair is organised and there are several fairground rides and other attractions, as well as cultural stands for the sale of specialist food and craft products.

==Economy==
* Milly produces many culinary and medicinal herbs. The firm of Daregal is a world leader and began in 1887 under the leadership of the Darbonne family who still run the enterprise.
* The Conservatoire National des Plantes à Parfum, Médicinales, Aromatiques et Industrielles is a botanical garden situated in a former farm.

==Culture==

* Christian Dior and Jean Cocteau have made their homes here. Cocteau died in 1963. Towards the end of the 1950s Jean Cocteau decorated the chapelle Saint-Blaise, which dates from the twelfth century. His theme was those medicinal and culinary herbs on which the renown of Milly rests. He is now buried in the chapel.
* &quot;Le Cyclop&quot;, a monumental sculpture in the forest of Milly-la-Forêt, constructed by Jean Tinguely in collaboration with Niki de Saint Phalle
* the 15th century covered market

==Twin towns==
