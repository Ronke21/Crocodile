<text>The &quot;Lafayette&quot; class of submarine was an evolutionary development from the of fleet ballistic missile submarine, slightly larger and generally improved. This class, together with the , , , and classes, composed the &quot;41 for Freedom,&quot; the Navy&#x27;s primary contribution to the nuclear deterrent force through the late 1980s. The &quot;James Madison&quot; and &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; classes are combined with the &quot;Lafayette&quot;s in some references.

==Design==
The first eight submarines initially deployed with the Polaris A-2 missile, later being refitted with the longer ranged Polaris A-3, with having the A-3 missile from the start. In the mid-1970s all were upgraded to carry the Poseidon C3 missile; their missile tubes were slightly larger than the &quot;Ethan Allen&quot; and &quot;George Washington&quot; classes and Poseidon was designed to take advantage of this. Unlike twelve of the similar &quot;James Madison&quot; and &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; classes, none of the &quot;Lafayette&quot;-class submarines were refitted with Trident I (C4) missiles.

The &quot;Lafayette&quot;s and their successors were equipped with a hovering system to manage trim more effectively when firing missiles; this increased the missile rate of fire from one per minute to four per minute.

&quot;Daniel Webster&quot; was originally built with diving planes mounted on a &quot;mini-sail&quot; near the bow, leading to her nickname &quot;Old Funny Fins&quot;. This configuration, unique to US submarines, was an attempt to reduce the effect of porpoising. While successful, the &quot;mini-sail&quot; required to contain the operating mechanism reduced hydrodynamic efficiency and lowered her overall speed. During a mid-1970s overhaul these unusual planes were removed and standard fairwater planes were installed. Here is a rare 1964 16mm Silent Film of USS Daniel Webster testing the unique &quot;Funny Fins&quot; diving planes off Cape Canaveral.

==Fate==
The &quot;Lafayette&quot;s were decommissioned between 1986 and 1992, due to a combination of SALT II treaty limitations as the SSBNs entered service, age, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. One (&quot;Daniel Webster&quot;) remains out of commission but converted to a Moored Training Ship (MTS-626) with the missile compartment removed. She is stationed at Nuclear Power Training Unit Charleston, South Carolina, along with and .

<text>Bârlad () is a city in Vaslui County, Romania. It lies on the banks of the river Bârlad, which waters the high plains of Western Moldavia.

At Bârlad the railway from Iași diverges, one branch skirting the river Siret, the other skirting the Prut; both reunite at Galați. Along with a maze of narrow and winding streets, Bârlad features several notable modern buildings, including the hospital administered by the Saint Spiridion Foundation of Iași. In the vicinity of the city are the ruins of a Roman camp.

The city is the birthplace of Romanian &quot;Domnitor&quot; (Ruler) and diplomat Alexandru Ioan Cuza.

==Etymology==
Scholars continue to debate the origin of the city&#x27;s name. The Hypatian Codex mentions a market town called &quot;Berlad&quot;, and some historians, influenced by a document Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu published in the 19th century, have tried to link this town and its inhabitants (variously considered Romanians, East Slavs or an amalgam) with the Moldavian Bârlad. Ioan Bogdan demonstrated that the Hasdeu document was false, thus invalidating the hypothesis. Like Siret and Suceava, the medieval town took its name from the adjacent river, but nothing more can be said for certain. Constantin Cihodaru linked the name, of possible Hungarian origin, to a Slavic word (&quot;berlo&quot; — &quot;rod&quot;, &quot;cottage&quot; or &quot;birlo&quot; — &quot;swamp&quot;), to which was added the Hungarian suffix &quot;-d&quot;, also found, for example, in the names Cenad, Arad, Tușnad, and Tășnad. Supporting this notion is the historic presence of a significant Hungarian community, with traditions recalling the fight against the Tatars in the mid-14th century.

==History==
During World War II, Bârlad was captured on 24 August 1944 by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front during the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive.

<text>The Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club is a Hong Kong watersports club for sailing and rowing including paddling.

== History ==
In 1849 the &quot;Victoria Regatta Club&quot; was formed and later absorbed into the &quot;Hong Kong Boating Clu&quot;b which, in 1889, was in turn merged into the &quot;Hong Kong Corinthian Sailing Club&quot;. At the General Meeting of the Hong Kong Corinthian Sailing Club held in October 1893 a resolution was passed that application should be made to the Admiralty for permission to call the Club &quot;The Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club&quot; and to fly the blue ensign with a distinctive mark on the flag. A warrant was granted by the Lords of the Admiralty on 15 May 1894.

Early members were British only with military personnel on the board. Until the 1950s membership was exclusively reserved for Europeans. Women were not allowed to be full members until 1977 when Patricia Loseby became the first female member. Today, membership is open to all.

Unlike other organisations in Hong Kong that had been granted a royal charter, the club retained the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix in its title after the handover to China in 1997, although a majority of its members supported a motion to remove it, this fell two votes short of the 75 percent majority required. Subsequently, the commodore at the time suggested that the club should adopt a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle as to the name, this being the principle by which Deng Xiao Ping, described the basis underlying the reunification of Hong Kong with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. At a Special General Meeting of members the proposal was enthusiastically adopted. The club&#x27;s English name remained &quot;The Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club&quot;, and the club&#x27;s Chinese title is simply &quot;Hong Kong Yacht Club&quot;, without the use of the term 皇家 &quot;Wong Ka&quot;, meaning &quot;Royal&quot;.

==Facilities==
The club operates from three sites:
===Kellett Island (Main Clubhouse)===

The main buildings of the club are located by Victoria Harbour on the former Kellett Island, now part of Causeway Bay following land reclamation, and forming the western boundary of the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter. The club moved there in 1938, and the clubhouse was built in International Modern style in 1939 on the foundations of the old Naval Powder Magazine. It was designed by architects G.G. Wood and J.E. Potter of Leigh &amp; Orange. The new premises were formally opened on 26 October 1940 by the Acting Governor, Lieutenant General E. F. Norton. The building has been listed as a Grade III historic building since 22 January 2010.

===Middle Island===

On Middle Island, accessible only via a club-owned sampan from a footpath from Repulse Bay or Deep Water Bay, or by swimming across the channel.

===Shelter Cove===

The Shelter Cove, in Hebe Haven, Sai Kung District, accessible by car.

===Former headquarters in North Point===
For 30 years prior to moving to Kellett Island, the main buildings of the club were located at No. 12 Oil Street, in North Point, then a waterfront location, before reclamation. The former headquarters and clubhouse in Oil Street, built in the Arts and Crafts style, was officially opened on 21 March 1908 by the then Governor, Sir Frederick Lugard. The building was subsequently used as a garage, government staff quarters until 1998, as a storehouse of the Antiquities and Monuments Office until late 2007. The buildings now house the Oi! arts center that aims to promote visual arts in Hong Kong by providing a platform for art exhibitions, forums and other art-related activities. The Former Clubhouse of Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club has been listed as a Grade II historic building since 1995.

<doc id="410270" wikidata="Q182762" url="?curid=410270" title="Prime Minister of Algeria">
<text>The First minister of Algeria is the head of government of Algeria. 

Nadir Larbaoui has been the prime minister since 11 November 2023.

The prime minister is appointed by the president of Algeria, along with other ministers and members of the government that the new prime minister recommends. The People&#x27;s National Assembly must approve the legislative program of the new government or the Assembly is dissolved and the prime minister must resign.

There are no constitutional limits on a prime minister&#x27;s term. The longest-serving prime minister was Mohamed Ben Ahmed Abdelghani, who served under President Chadli Bendjedid from 8 March 1979 until 22 January 1984. He served as the first prime minister since 1963, when the position was abolished.

==Role and Constitution==
The title of the prime minister has evolved as follows since the independence of 1962:

* &quot;Head of Government:&quot; September 27, 1962 - September 15, 1963 
* &quot;Prime Minister:&quot; March 8, 1979 - November 5, 1988
* &quot;Head of Government:&quot; November 5, 1988 - November 12, 2008
* &quot;Prime Minister:&quot; November 12, 2008 - December 30, 2020 
* &quot;Prime Minister or Head of Government:&quot; since December 30, 2020

The Constituent Assembly of 1962 decided to designate a Head of Government, President of the Council until the adoption of the Constitution. The Constitution of 1963 does not include the position of prime minister. 

In the 1976 Constitution, the position is optional and was not assigned under the presidency of Houari Boumédiène. Starting from the constitutional revision of 1988, the position was simply referred to as Head of Government. 

During the constitutional revision of 2008, there was again mention of a prime minister appointed by the president of the Republic. 

Finally, the constitutional revision of 2020 provides for the designation of a Head of Government in case of a parliamentary majority opposed to the president of the Republic, or a prime minister in case of a presidential majority.

==Tenure==
The Prime Minister or Head of Government is appointed by the President of the Republic like any other member of the government. They are first appointed to the cabinet and then propose individuals for vacant government positions.

If the outgoing government has not resigned, the new prime minister is not tasked with forming a new government.

The National People&#x27;s Assembly must approve the Prime Minister&#x27;s general policy statement, or they may be dismissed from their position.

There is no constitutional limit to the duration of a Prime Minister&#x27;s term. Mohamed Abdelghani served nearly five consecutive years from 1979 to 1984. 

However, since 2005, Ahmed Ouyahia holds the record for the longest tenure, serving ten years as prime minister from 1995 to 1998, 2003 to 2006, 2008 to 2012, and from 2017 to 2019. He is also the only individual to have held the position more than once.

<text>The Czech Republic is a parliamentary representative democracy in which the president is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government.

The first president of the Czech Republic was Václav Havel. The current president, Petr Pavel, was sworn into office on 9 March 2023. 

Until 2012, presidents were elected by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate for a term of five years. Since 2013, presidents have been elected by popular vote.

;&quot;Political parties&quot;

;&quot;Other factions&quot;


==Timeline==
==Languages spoken by the presidents of the Czech Republic==
All four presidents of the Czech Republic have shown proficiency in languages other than Czech. All presidents are so far fluent in English and Russian language. Václav Klaus is the president who is proficient in the most languages.

===Václav Havel===
Václav Havel spoke some English and used it repeatedly during his tenure as president as he was reading several speeches in English. Havel most notably used his English when he gave a speech to a Joint session of the United States Congress on 21 February 1990, which he started in English but continued in Czech after a few sentences, and the speech was translated by Michael Žantovský, then spokesman of Občanské fórum. Žantovský later jokingly claimed that Havel made his famous speech only to him and it was him, Žantovský, who actually spoke to US Congress. Havel also knew Russian, which he learned at school.

===Václav Klaus===
Václav Klaus is fluent in English, Russian, German, and Italian. He published a number of publications in English and German languages. Klaus stated that his proficiency with foreign languages was helped by studies of international trade at the Prague University of Economics and Business, where he was required to learn at least three foreign languages.

===Miloš Zeman===
Miloš Zeman is fluent in English, Russian, and German. He used English and Russian during his tenure while talking to foreign politicians.

===Petr Pavel===
Petr Pavel is fluent in English, Russian, and French. Pavel reportedly has known English well since his youth, which helps his career in the army as only few people there knew the language. Pavel learned French during an intelligence course in 1988–89.

<text>Ali Benflis (; born 8 September 1944) is an Algerian politician who was Head of Government of Algeria from 2000 to 2004. In 2003, he became the general secretary of the National Liberation Front party. Benflis was a candidate in the 2004 presidential election, but the poll resulted in the re-election of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Benflis ran yet again as an independent candidate in the 2014 Algerian presidential elections held on 17 April 2014. The result was that Abdelaziz Bouteflika was reelected as president with 81.53% of the votes, with Benflis ending as runner-up with 12.18%.

== Early life ==
Benflis was born on 8 September 1944 in Batna, which is the fifth largest city in Algeria. When he was 13 years old, Benflis lost his father and older brother during the Algerian War.

After that, he was appointed Head of the Government and Secretary-General of the FLN Party, and it was during this post when he ran for president in the 8 April 2004 election. The results of that election were largely seen as distorted by fraud.

Ali Benflis is a veteran human rights activist. He is a founding member of the Algerian Human Rights League, which was set up on 11 November 1987 by the Minister of the Interior and Major-General Larbi Belkheir, with the aim of counteracting the .

Benflis was a member of the executive committee of the Algerian Human Rights League, as well as a delegate for the country&#x27;s eastern area. His mandate ended on 9 November 1998.

He obtained his law degree in 1968 from The Faculty of Law and Economic Sciences University in Algeria. He became a magistrate and was appointed judge at the Court of Blida in October 1968. It was shortly after this appointment, that he was posted in the central administration of the Ministry of Justice, where he became a sub-director of juvenile delinquency until the end of 1969. After that, he was appointed prosecutor at the Court of Batna until 1971. From 1971 – 1974 Benflis was acting General-Attorney at the Court of Constantine. It was during this time that he decided to cement his place in legal work, and join the bar.

In 1974, he quickly proved to be one of the most influential lawyers of his generation. So much so, that his peers elected him President of the Lawyers for the Batna area from 1983 – 1985. He was also elected as a member of the executive committee of the National Council of Lawyers during the same period. In 1987, Benflis’ stature catapulted him to the position of President of the Bar for Batna. These influential posts were what led Ali Benflis to be appointed Minister of Justice in Algeria, in November 1988.

As minister of Justice (1988 – 1991), the justice system witnessed its deepest and most daring reforms. One such measure was known as the Status of the Judicial Authorities, which established, for the first time, the independence of the judiciary. Several other laws were passed under Benflis: The law governing the lawyers’ profession which reinforced the rights of the defence, the laws related to the professions of notaries and bailiffs as well as texts relating to the clerk&#x27;s office. He initiated the adoption of texts consolidating freedom and human rights such as the abolition of the banishment sentence and the elimination of the State Security Court. He improved the prison conditions.

Minister of Justice in three different governments, he will be remembered as the one who required from the authorities that certain judiciary guarantees be respected, such as the right of recourse and the right to a defending counsel for the people subjected to a measure of internment without trial taken in application of the 1991 decree instituting the Emergency State. He will also be remembered because he resigned from the government when his request was not taken into account.

===Prime Minister (2000-2004)===
Ali Benflis was appointed Prime Minister of Algeria in August 2000. His mandate was renewed in June 2002. During this time, he implemented a new style of governance based on dialogue and consultation. His judicial expertise and open-mindedness allowed him to be able to defuse many social conflicts. He obtained support from his social and economic partners for his legislative initiatives on economic and social reforms. Ali Benflis left the post of prime minister on 13 August 2004.

&quot;Al Monitor&quot; claimed that the Benflis prime ministership was &quot;marked by high-profile scandals&quot;.

Benflis&#x27; political career was prompted by his election to the Central Committee and the Political Bureau of the FLN in December 1989. He was successively re-elected in 1991, 1996, 1998 and 2000. His political career was further catapulted in September 2001, when he was elected the General-Secretary of the party, and then re-elected on 14 October 2003 during the party&#x27;s 8th Congress.

;Black Spring
According to &quot;Al Monitor&quot;, &quot;many voters&quot; were &quot;turned off&quot; Benflis because of the killing by authorities of 126 (or 127) protesters during the Black Spring that took place in 2001 during his prime ministership. The Black Spring consisted of protests in Kabylie in favour of Berber cultural rights.

===2004 presidential election===
Benflis was a main candidate in opposition to Abdelaziz Bouteflika during the 2004 Algerian presidential election, but came a distant second as Bouteflika won with 85.0% of the vote against just 6.4% for Benflis. The turnout was 58.1%.

Four months after the results of the 8 April 2004 presidential election were announced, Benflis retired his mandate as Secretary-General of the FLN Party on 19 August 2004. He denounced the election results, which were seen by many as marred by fraud. But Ali Benflis made it very clear that just because he was giving up his post, did not mean he was leaving the political scene. He insists he remains loyal to his ideas.

Benflis did not present his candidacy during the 2009 presidential election again won by Bouteflika by 90.24% of the vote.

=== 2014 presidential election ===
On 19 January 2014, Benflis announced his intention to stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election. Candidate website.

Algerian Interior Minister Taieb Belaiz announced on 18 April that Bouteflika had won 81.53% of the vote, while Benflis was second placed with 12.18%. The turnout was 51.7%, down from the 75% turnout in 2009.

After the polls closed, Benflis criticised the election as having been marked by &quot;fraud on a massive scale.&quot; The turnout figures were also criticised for allegedly being inflated.

=== 2019 presidential election ===
Ali Benflis is a candidate in the third attempted date for organising the 2019 Algerian presidential election, on 12 December 2019. &quot;Al Jazeera English&quot; described Benflis and the other four candidates as &quot;all part of the political establishment&quot;.

== Marriage, family, and personal life ==
Ali Benflis is married, and is the father of four children.

<text>Sir Christian John Storey Bonington, CVO, CBE, DL (born 6 August 1934) is a British mountaineer.

His career has included nineteen expeditions to the Himalayas, including four to Mount Everest.

==Early life and expeditions==
Bonington&#x27;s father, who left the family when Christian was nine months old, was a founding member of L Detachment, Special Air Service. Bonington first began climbing in 1951 at age 16. Educated at University College School in Hampstead, Bonington joined the Royal Fusiliers before attending Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and on graduation was commissioned in the Royal Tank Regiment in 1956. After serving three years in North Germany, he spent two years at the Army Outward Bound School as a mountaineering instructor.

Bonington was part of the party that made the first British ascent of the South West Pillar (aka Bonatti Pillar) of the Aiguille du Dru in 1958, and the first ascent of the Central Pillar of Freney on the south side of Mont Blanc in 1961 with Don Whillans, Ian Clough and Jan Dlugosz (Poland). In 1960 he was part of the successful joint British-Indian-Nepalese forces expedition to Annapurna II.

On leaving the British Army in 1961, he joined Van den Berghs, a division of Unilever, but he left after nine months, and became a professional mountaineer and explorer. In 1966 he was given his first assignment by &quot;The Daily Telegraph Magazine&quot; to cover other expeditions, including climbing Sangay in Ecuador and hunting caribou with Inuit on Baffin Island. In 1968 he accompanied Captain John Blashford-Snell and his British Army team in the attempt to make the first-ever descent of the Blue Nile.

In 1972 he was unsuccessful on the south-west face of Mount Everest, but reached 27,300 feet. He had another shot at that route in 1975, and the 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition that he led was successful--it put four climbers on the summit, but Mick Burke died during his summit attempt.

==Writing==
Bonington has written or edited numerous books, made many television appearances, and received many honours, including the chancellorship of Lancaster University from 2005 to 2014. He is honorary president of the Hiking Club and Lancaster University Mountaineering Club and has a boat named after him among Lancaster University Boat Club&#x27;s fleet. Furthermore, he is the Honorary President of the British Orienteering Federation. He has lived in Cumbria since 1974. He is a patron, and former president (1988–91), of the British Mountaineering Council (BMC). He succeeded Edmund Hillary as the Honorary President of Mountain Wilderness, an international NGO dedicated to the preservation of mountain areas, in their natural and cultural aspects.

==Personal life==
Bonington&#x27;s first wife, Wendy, a freelance illustrator of children&#x27;s books, died on 24 July 2014 from motor neuron disease (MND), inspiring Bonington to support MND charities. The couple had three children: Conrad (died 1966), Daniel, and Rupert. The family lived at Caldbeck, Cumbria.

Bonington married Loreto McNaught-Davis on Saturday 23 April 2016. McNaught-Davis is the widow of mountaineer and television presenter Ian McNaught-Davis who died in February 2014. The ceremony took place in London in the presence of about 60 friends and family members.

==Tributes==
In 1974 Bonington received the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1985 he received the Lawrence of Arabia Memorial Medal of the Royal Society for Asian Affairs. St. Helen&#x27;s School, Northwood, England has named one of its four houses after him. Bonington was presented with the Golden Eagle Award for services to the outdoors in 2008 by the Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2003 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at a hotel in Heathrow.

==Honours==
Bonington was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1976 New Year Honours &quot;for services to Mountaineering&quot;, in recognition of the previous year&#x27;s successful ascent of Everest and was knighted in the 1996 New Year Honours, again for his services to the sport. He was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 2010 Birthday Honours for his services to the Outward Bound Trust. He was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of Cumbria in 2004. In 2015, Bonington was awarded the 7th Piolet d&#x27;Or Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>Caracal () is a city in Olt County, Romania, situated in the historic region of Oltenia, on the plains between the lower reaches of the Jiu and Olt rivers. The region&#x27;s plains are well known for their agricultural specialty in cultivating grains and over the centuries, Caracal has been the trading center for the region&#x27;s agricultural output. Caracal has a population of 27,403 and is the second largest city in the region.

==Etymology==
While 19th century historians thought that the name of Caracal is linked to Roman emperor Caracalla, the current accepted etymology is that city&#x27;s name is derived from the Cuman language &quot;kara kale&quot; meaning &quot;Black fortress&quot; (&quot;kara&quot;, meaning &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;kal&quot;, either from the Turkish &quot;kale&quot;, or the Arabic &quot;qal&#x27;at&quot;, both meaning fortress).

==History==
The end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw Caracal experience significant growth and the region become one of the most important agricultural regions in Romania. Caracal was this region&#x27;s capital and seat of Romanați County. World War II and the communist regime brought changes to this region and to the city of Caracal. During World War II a Nazi concentration camp was located near the city. The communist government, which disestablished Romanați County, instituted industrialization plans and Caracal experienced continued economic growth through the establishment of industrial plants in the textile industry sector.

The town underwent major changes after the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime was overthrown by the December 1989 Revolution, with many factories collapsing under the pressure of privatisation.

<text>Axbridge is a town in Somerset, England, on the River Axe, near the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. Its population according to the 2011 census was 2,057.

==History==

&quot;Axanbrycg&quot; is suggested as the source of the name, meaning a bridge over the River Axe, in the early 9th century.

Early inhabitants of the area almost certainly include the Romans (who are known to have mined lead on the top of the Mendips) and earlier still, prehistoric man, who lived in the local caves, and whose flint tools have been found on the slopes of the local hills. The history of Axbridge can be traced back to the reign of King Alfred when it was part of the Saxons&#x27; defence system for Wessex against the Vikings. In the Burghal Hidage, a list of &quot;burhs&quot; compiled in 910, it was listed as &quot;Axanbrycg&quot;. A listing of Axbridge appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &#x27;, meaning &#x27;axe bridge&#x27; from the Old English &#x27; and &quot;&quot;.

It was part of the royal manor of Cheddar and part of the Winterstoke Hundred.
It was granted a royal charter in 1202, when King John sold most of the royal manor of Cheddar to the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Axbridge grew in the Tudor period as a centre for cloth manufacture, This was reflected in its early royal charters allowing it to hold markets and fairs, and become a royal borough. It even had its own mint, with coins showing the town&#x27;s symbol: the Lamb and Flag. Trade was possible as the River Axe was navigable to wharves at Axbridge.

Later the town&#x27;s importance declined, which led to stagnation and the preservation of many historic buildings in the town centre. These include King John&#x27;s Hunting Lodge (actually a Tudor building) which is now used as a museum.

Axbridge is a very old borough and sent members to parliament in the reigns of Edward I and Edward III.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries iron ore was extracted from the hill above and east of Axbridge.

Axbridge railway station, on the Cheddar Valley line, opened on 3 August 1869. It closed to goods traffic on 10 June 1963 and to passengers on 9 September 1963. The route of the railway is now the A371 Axbridge bypass, but the station buildings and goods shed still survive.

The Square was used as the setting for a NatWest Bank television advert in the early 1990s, and in particular Axbridge Town Hall doubled as a NatWest branch. Ironically a real branch of NatWest, in the High Street, was closed not long afterwards and the premises are now private residential accommodation. In 2017 several locations in the town were used for a Thatchers Cider television commercial, which featured a hot air balloon.

==Governance==

The town council (which is a parish council) has responsibility for local issues. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. The town council also initiates projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, and consults with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. Each year members of the town council elect a mayor for the town. Axbridge Town Council is based at Axbridge Town Hall.

For local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, the town comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Axbridge Rural District.

The town is in Axevale electoral ward. Axbridge is the most populous area but the ward stretches south to Chapel Allerton. The total ward population as taken at the 2011 census is 4,261.

It is also part of the Wells and Mendip Hills county constituency represented in the House of Commons. It elects one MP by the first-past-the-post system of election.

==Facilities==

In 2012, The Roxy community cinema was reopened after a five-year renovation programme. This was aided by the Big Lottery Fund, and re-used old seats from the Colston Hall in Bristol. It has 32 seats and an art deco box office. The premises used to be the Axbridge Lion pub, a Georgian Grade II listed building.

The Axbridge Film Society is based at the cinema. In 2016 volunteers raised £5,000 for repairs to the cinema and plans have been drawn up for further refurbishment and the installation of new sound and projection equipment.

==Church of St John==
The 13th-century parish Church of St John is a grade I listed building.

Work on the current building began in the early 15th century, and grew from an earlier building dating back to about 1230. The church is built of limestone and decorated with Doulting stone, while the steps are an interesting example of dolomitic conglomerate, which is known as &quot;puddingstone&quot;. The crossing tower is over high, and holds six bells, one of which dating from 1723 was made by Edward Bilbie of the Bilbie family. The statue on the east side is that of St John the Baptist. On the west side is a king — perhaps Henry VII, which would place it after 1485. The north-aisle ceiling retains some mediaeval painted panels, and amongst the carved bosses is the head of a Green Man, with leaves sprouting around his face. The nave roof is Jacobean and dates from 1636. Restoration was undertaken in 1888 by J.D. Sedding, who contributed the fine parclose screens.

==Status of settlement==

In contrast to the much larger settlement of Cheddar immediately to the south east that remains a village, Axbridge is a town. This apparently illogical situation is explained by the relative importance of the two places in historic times. While Axbridge grew in importance as a centre for cloth manufacture in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed dairy-farming village until the advent of tourism and the arrival of the railway in the Victorian era.

==Workhouse==
The Axbridge Union workhouse was erected in 1837 on the south side of West Street in Axbridge. The Poor Law Commissioners authorised expenditure of £4,496 17s 6d on construction of the building, which was intended to accommodate 250 inmates. It was designed by Samuel T Welch, who was also the architect of workhouses at Wells and Clifton. By 1929 the workhouse had become officially known as Axbridge Poor Law Institution.

==Events==
On the Saturday of the first Bank Holiday weekend in May, the annual Somerset Showcase took place. This includes craft displays and market, farmers&#x27; market, entertainment, exhibitions and live music in the evening. September sees the annual Blackberry Carnival, Fair in the Square and Harvest Home, which was introduced in 2007. Other events throughout the year include the Progressive Supper and Santa in the Square. Since 2009, a Concert by Candlelight has been held in the Church of St John the Baptist to coincide with Earth Hour, when people try to reduce their electricity usage.

Axbridge hosts one of the few remaining historical pageants in the UK every 10 years. This started in 1967 in celebration of the opening of the bypass. The next pageant was in 1970 and there has been one every decade since then except the 2020 pageant which was delayed until 2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pageant features a cast of 300 and charts the town&#x27;s history in 15 scenes featuring battles, riots and fights with live music, horses and livestock, plus a train and vintage cars. The 2022 pageant programme was expanded to be a small festival with live music in the evenings.

Axbridge Cricket Club was established in 2004, and plays around 35 friendly matches per season. The club also enjoys an annual club tour and plays other friendly sides around the Somerset county.

The town holds a farmers&#x27; market each month in The Square on the first Saturday of each month.

<text>The prime minister of the Czech Republic (Czech: &quot;Předseda vlády České republiky&quot;) is the head of the government of the Czech Republic and the &quot;de facto&quot; leader and most powerful member of the executive branch.

The Constitution provides that certain presidential actions require the prime minister&#x27;s countersignature, including in appointing judges and ambassadors, commanding the military, ratifying treaties and issuing amnesties.

The current prime minister, Petr Fiala, leader of the ODS, was sworn-in by President Miloš Zeman on 17 December 2021, following the 2021 election and serves as 13th person in the office.

==Role==
The prime minister is also authorised to release a member of the government or from confidence, relating to classified information. By virtue of their position, they represent the Czech Republic in the European Council and are entitled to a diplomatic passport.

The prime minister also serves as direct superior of the General Inspection of Security Forces, when they appoint and dismiss its director, who is responsible to them of the performance of their function.

According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister bears responsibility for signing the decisions together with the entire government of Czech Republic. They can authorise another member of the government to countersign and refuse to co-sign.

==Powers==
One important power of the prime minister is the possibility of replacing the entire government by their decision and declare a state of emergency. The government must approve or cancel its decision within 24 hours of its announcement. In case a decision-making crisis would pass to the government, the prime minister would decide with Ministry of Defense.

==Residence==
The building was built from 1911 to 1914. It was designed by the Viennese architect Friedrich Ohmann.

<doc id="410288" wikidata="Q1819381" url="?curid=410288" title="President of the Czech Republic">
<text>The president of the Czech Republic, constitutionally defined as the President of the Republic (), is the head of state of the Czech Republic and the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic.

The presidency has largely been shaped by its inaugural holder, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, who assumed the office after the Czechoslovak declaration of independence was proclaimed in 1918. The 1920 Constitution granted the president substantial powers and Masaryk&#x27;s political strength and popularity enabled the presidency to exert considerable influence over the Czech public life. In modern times, the president is largely a ceremonial figure with limited powers as the day-to-day business of the executive government is entrusted to the prime minister, and many of the president&#x27;s actions require prime ministerial approval. Nevertheless, as the bearer of the nation&#x27;s &quot;Truth prevails&quot; motto, the presidency is widely viewed to be a significant source of prestige, power and moral authority in both domestic and foreign affairs. The president, seated at the Prague Castle, has oftentimes been perceived through the prism of the nation&#x27;s monarchical past. The office has retained the power to grant full pardons, commute criminal penalties and issue amnesties. The president possesses with a suspensory veto power which can be overridden by an absolute majority of the Chamber of Deputies.

The Constitution provides that the president cannot be held responsible for his own conduct, except in cases of treason or high violation against the Constitution. The Parliament maintains the sole power of impeachment and the president may only be removed from office by a trial before the Constitutional Court. The president is solely responsible for appointing the prime minister, the Cabinet ministers, as well as the members of the board of the Czech National Bank, and nominating justices to the Constitutional Court, who are subject to Senate approval, among others.

The president is elected directly using the two-round system to a five-year term. Prior to 2013, the president was selected by a joint session of the Parliament. Under Article 57 of the Constitution, no individual may be elected to more than two consecutive terms. The current president, Petr Pavel, was elected in the 2023 election, and assumed office on 9 March 2023.

==Powers==
The framers of the Constitution of the Czech Republic intended to set up a parliamentary system, with the prime minister as the country&#x27;s leading political figure and the de facto chief executive and the president as a ceremonial head of state. However, the stature of the first president, Václav Havel, was such that the office acquired greater influence than the framers intended, although not nearly as powerful as the Czechoslovak presidency.

===Absolute authority===
The president of the Czech Republic has the authority to act independently in a number of substantive areas. One of the office&#x27;s strongest powers is that of veto, which returns a bill to parliament. Although the veto may be overridden by parliament with an absolute majority vote (over 50%) of all deputies, the ability to refuse to sign legislation acts as a check on the power of the legislature. The only kind of bills a president can neither veto nor approve are acts that would change the constitution.

The president also has the leading role in the appointment of persons to key high offices, including appointment of judges to the Supreme and Constitutional Courts (with the permission of the Senate), and members of the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank.

===Limited sole authority===
There are some powers reserved to the president, but can be exercised only under limited circumstances. Chief among these is the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies. While the president can dissolve the Chamber on his own authority, forcing a new election of that body within 60 days, this can be done only under conditions prescribed by the constitution.

===Duties shared===
Many of the president&#x27;s powers can only be exercised with the assent of the government, as expressed by the signature of the prime minister. These include all matters having to do with foreign relations and the use of the military, the appointment of judges to lower courts, and the granting of amnesty. Except when the Chamber of Deputies has been dissolved because of its failure to form or maintain a government, the president may call for elections to the Chamber and the Senate only with the prime minister&#x27;s approval.

The president also shares responsibility with the Chamber of Deputies for appointing the president and vice president of the Supreme Control Officethe body in charge of implementing the national budgetalthough this appointment does not technically require the signature of the prime minister.

===Immunity from prosecution===
Art 65 (1) prevents trial or detention for any criminal or administrative offense while in office. The only sort of prosecution allowed for a sitting president is that of high treason, which can only be carried out by the Senate, and can only result in removal from office and a ban on regaining the office at a later date.

===Ceremonial powers===
Many of the duties of the Czech president can be said to be ceremonial to one degree or another, especially since the president has relatively few powers independent of the will of the prime minister. A good example of this is the status as commander in chief of the military. No part of these duties can take place but through the assent of the prime minister. In matters of war, he is in every sense merely a figurehead, since the constitution gives all substantive constitutional authority over the use of the armed forces to the parliament. In fact, the only specific thing the constitution allows the president to do with respect to the military is to appoint its generalsbut even this must be done with the signature of the prime minister.

Many of the president&#x27;s ceremonial duties fall under provisions of the constitution that allow the exercise of powers &quot;not explicitly defined&quot; in the constitution, but allowed by a lesser law. In other words, Parliament has the power to allow the president whatever responsibilities they deem proper, without necessarily having to amend the constitution. Such a law was passed in 1994 with respect to the awarding of state decorations. While the constitution explicitly allows the conferring of honors and awarding of medals by the president only with the signature of the prime minister, parliament acted in 1994 to grant the president power to do so on his own authority. Hence, this particular duty is effectively shared between the parliament and the president. The act even allows the president to choose someone to perform the actual presentation ceremony.

==Election==
Until 2012, the office of president was filled following an indirect election by the Parliament of the Czech Republic. In February 2012, a change to a direct election was passed by the Senate, and after the related implementation law also was passed by both chambers of the parliament, it was enacted by presidential assent on 1 August 2012; meaning that it legally entered into force on 1 October 2012.

===Electoral procedure===
The term of office of the president is 5 years. A newly elected president will begin the five-year term on the day of taking the official oath. Candidates standing for office must be at least 40 years of age, and must not have already been elected twice consecutively. Since the only term limit is that no person can be elected more than twice &quot;consecutively&quot;, a person may theoretically achieve the presidency &quot;more&quot; than twice. Prospective candidates must either submit petitions with the signatures of 50,000 citizens, or be nominated by 20 deputies or 10 senators.

The constitution does not prescribe a specific date for presidential elections, but stipulates that elections shall occur in the window between 30 and 60 days before the end of the sitting president&#x27;s term, provided that it was called at least 90 days prior to the selected election day. In the event of a president&#x27;s death, resignation or removal, the election can be held at the earliest 10 days after being called and at the latest 80 days after vacancy of the presidential seat. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff is held between the top two candidates.

The constitution makes specific allowances for the failure of a new president to be elected. If a new president has not been elected by the end of a president&#x27;s term, or if 30 days elapse following a vacancy, some powers are conferred upon the prime minister, some are moved to the chairman of the Chamber of Deputies or to the chairman of the Senate, if parliament is in a state of dissolution at the time of the vacancy.

The first direct presidential election in the Czech Republic was held 11–12 January 2013, with a runoff on 25–26 January.

===Previous electoral procedure (until 1 October 2012)===
Under Article 58 of the current Czech Constitution, nominees to the office must be put forward by no fewer than 10 Deputies or 10 Senators. Once nominees are in place, a ballot can begin. Each ballot can have at most three rounds. In the first round, a victorious candidate requires an absolute majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Given a 200-seat Chamber and an 81-seat Senate, a successful first-round candidate requires 101 deputies and 41 senators.

If no single candidate gets a majority of both the Chamber and the Senate, a second round is then called for. At this stage, a candidate requires an absolute majority of merely those present at the time of voting in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The number of votes required in the second round might be the same as in the first round but, as in 2008, can be a little less due to the absence of a few parliamentarians. In this second round, a single candidate would still need to win a majority in both the Chamber and the Senate.

Should no single candidate achieve a majority of both houses then present, a third round is necessitated. In this final round, which can happen within 14 days of the first round, an absolute majority of deputies and senators present suffices. At this stage, the individual houses of parliament are not considered separately. Assuming that all members of parliament are present, all that is required to win is 141 votes, regardless of the house of origin. If no candidate wins in the third round, another ballot has to be considered in a subsequent joint session of parliament. The process continues under the same rules until a candidate prevails.

In 1993, the Republic&#x27;s first president, Václav Havel, had little difficulty achieving victory on the first round of the first ballot, but his re-election bid proved bumpier. In 1998, he was elected with a cumulative seven-vote margin on the second round of the first ballot. By contrast, his successor, Václav Klaus, has required the full measure of the process. He narrowly won election on the third ballot at the 2003 election and on the sixth (second attempt, third ballot) in 2008. Both his elections were won in the third round. His biggest margin of victory was two votes.

===Dissatisfaction with previous procedure===
Following the 2003 and 2008 elections, which both required multiple ballots, some in the Czech political community expressed dissatisfaction with this method of election. In 2008, Martin Bursík, leader of the Czech Green Party, said of the 2008 vote, &quot;We are sitting here in front of the public somewhat muddied by backstage horse-trading, poorly concealed meetings with lobbyists and intrigue.&quot; There were calls to adopt a system with a direct election, in which the public would be involved in the voting. However, opponents of this plan pointed out that the presidency had always been determined by indirect vote, going back through several predecessor states to the presidency of Tomáš Masaryk. Charles University political scientist Zdeněk Zbořil suggested that direct voting could result in a president and prime minister who were hostile to each other&#x27;s goals, leading to deadlock. A system of direct elections was supported by figures including Jiří Čunek (Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party) and Jiří Paroubek (Czech Social Democratic Party), whereas the ruling Civic Democratic Party, under both President Václav Klaus and Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, was more skeptical. Topolánek commented that it was an advantage that &quot;our presidential elections are not preceded by some campaign, that is unavoidable in a direct election and causes rifts among citizens&quot;. Using Poland as an unfavourable example, he said that &quot;when someone talks about how our method of selecting the head of state is undignified, he should first weigh the consequences of a direct vote&quot;.

==Removal from office==
Aside from death, there are only three things that can effect a president&#x27;s removal from office:
#A president can resign by notifying the President of the Senate.
#The president may be deemed unable to execute his duties for &quot;serious reasons&quot; by a joint resolution of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputiesalthough the president may appeal to the Constitutional Court to have this resolution overturned.
#The president may be impeached by the Senate for high treason and convicted by the Constitutional Court.

==Succession==
In the case when the president is unable to perform his/her duties or if the presidency becomes vacant for any reason, the duties are divided between the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the Prime Minister. Should the Chamber of Deputies be dissolved at the time, the duties which normally fall to the Chamber&#x27;s President fall to the President of the Senate, who also assumes the President&#x27;s responsibility for calling elections for the Chamber even when the Chamber is not dissolved.

==Trappings of office==

===Presidential fanfare===

Since the first Czechoslovak president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the presidential fanfare has been the introduction to Bedřich Smetana&#x27;s opera &quot;Libuše&quot;, which is symbol of the patriotism of the Czech people during the Czech National Revival under the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.

===Heraldry===
The office of president carries with it an iconography, established through laws passed by the parliament. Perhaps the most visible of these is the flag of the president, as seen at top right. His official motto is the same as that of the Republic: &quot;Pravda vítězí&quot; (&quot;Truth prevails&quot;).

Inasmuch as the president is the titular sole administrator of Prague Castle, the presidency may also be said to control the heraldry of that institution as well, including but not limited to the special designs worn by the Castle Guard, which is a special unit of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, organized under the Military Office of the President of the Czech Republic, directly subordinate to the president.

Furthermore, the president, while in office, is entitled to wear the effects of the highest class of the Republic&#x27;s two ceremonial orders, the Order of the White Lion and the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. By the power of being inaugurated, the president becomes the holder of the highest class of both orders for the duration of his term in office as well as their supreme administrator. By convention, the Parliament allows a retiring president to remain a life-long member of both institutions, with the order decorations returning to the State upon the former president&#x27;s death.

===Residences===

The official residence of the president of the Czech Republic is Prague Castle. However, the living quarters are small and not particularly comfortable, so recent presidents (Václav Havel, Václav Klaus and Miloš Zeman) have chosen to live elsewhere. The president also maintains a summer residence at the castle in the village of Lány, 35 km west of Prague.

<doc id="410291" wikidata="Q5512197" url="?curid=410291" title="G. David Schine">
<text>Gerard David Schine, better known as G. David Schine or David Schine (September 11, 1927 – June 19, 1996), was the wealthy heir to a hotel chain fortune who became a central figure in the Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954 in his role as the chief consultant to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Later in life, he became a part of the film/television industry. He was the executive producer for the 1971 film &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

==Early life==
Schine was born in Gloversville, New York, to Jewish parents, hotel magnate Junius Myer Schine and Hildegarde Feldman. He attended Phillips Academy and graduated from Harvard University in 1949. He had entered Harvard in the summer of 1945, taken a leave of absence in the spring of 1946, and returned in the fall of 1947 after a year working as an assistant purser for the Army Transport Service. Though this was a civilian position, he wrote on his application for re-admission to Harvard that he was a &quot;lieutenant in the Army,&quot; and other students resented his calling himself a veteran. Said one, &quot;We were all veterans and his pretending to be one went over like a lead balloon.&quot; 

At Harvard, he lived, according to a later &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; portrait, &quot;in a style which went out here with the era of the Gold Coast,&quot; the years before World War I when wealthy Harvard students lived apart from their classmates in private accommodations. College administrators denied his requests to use his dormitory room as an office and to allow a female secretary to visit outside of regular visiting hours. He did, however, conduct the university band and also served as its drum major.

==Anti-communism and Army–McCarthy hearings==
In 1952 Schine published a six-page anti-communist pamphlet called &quot;Definition of Communism&quot; and had a copy placed in every room of his family&#x27;s chain of hotels. Although the pamphlet contained many errors, &quot;Time&quot; called it &quot;remarkably succinct.&quot; The pamphlet introduced Schine to Roy Cohn through newspaper columnist George Sokolsky, and the two became friends. Cohn at that time was Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s chief counsel, and he brought Schine onto McCarthy&#x27;s staff as an unpaid &quot;chief consultant&quot;.

McCarthy-era opponents of Communism sought to stamp out material they viewed as pro-Communist. Schine and Cohn conducted a much-criticized tour of Europe in 1953, examining libraries of the United States Information Agency for books written by authors they deemed to be Communists or fellow travelers. &quot;Die Welt&quot; of Hamburg called them &quot;Schnüffler&quot; or snoops. Theodore Kaghan, Deputy Director of the Public Affairs Division in the Office of the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany and a target of the subcommittee, called them &quot;junketeering gumshoes.&quot;

In November 1953, Schine was drafted into the United States Army as a private. Cohn immediately began a campaign to obtain special privileges for Schine. Cohn met with and made repeated telephone calls to military officials from the Secretary of the Army down to Schine&#x27;s company commander. He asked that Schine be given a commission (which the Army refused due to Schine&#x27;s lack of qualifications) as well as light duties, extra leave, and no overseas assignments. At one point, Cohn was reported to have threatened to &quot;wreck the Army&quot; if his demands were not met. During the Army-McCarthy Hearings of 1954, the Army charged Cohn and McCarthy with using improper pressure to influence the Army, while McCarthy and Cohn counter-charged that the Army was holding Schine &quot;hostage&quot; in an attempt to squelch McCarthy&#x27;s investigations into Communists in the Army.

The hearings were broadcast live using the relatively new medium of television and were viewed by an estimated 20 million people. Just prior to the hearings, Schine and Cohn appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on March 22, 1954, under the banner &quot;McCarthy and His Men&quot;.

The Army–McCarthy hearings absolved McCarthy of any direct wrongdoing, blaming Cohn alone. The exposure of McCarthy and his methods before a television audience, however, is widely considered to have heralded the beginning of the end of his career. Cohn resigned from McCarthy&#x27;s staff shortly after the hearings.

==Later years==
After the hearings, Schine left politics and refused to comment on the episode for the rest of his life, so his view of his relationship with Cohn remains unknown. He remained active in the private sector as a businessman and an entrepreneur, working in the hotel, music, and film industries. He was for a time a member of the Young Presidents&#x27; Organization. On October 22, 1957, he married Miss Universe of 1955, Hillevi Rombin of Sweden. They had six children and were married for nearly 40 years. Also in 1957, Schine&#x27;s father named him head of Schine Enterprises, though in 1963 Schine&#x27;s father resumed his position as head of the company. In 1977, Schine described himself as &quot;retired.&quot;

== Television/film/music industry work ==
Schine made a cameo appearance as himself on a 1968 episode of &quot;Batman.&quot; Schine was executive producer of the 1971 film &quot;The French Connection,&quot; which was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won five, including Best Picture. In 1977, he produced the documentary &quot;That&#x27;s Action!&quot; Shortly afterwards, Schine was involved with music by The DeFranco Family that achieved &quot;Billboard&quot; gold and platinum and &quot;Cash Box&quot; No. 1. Schine&#x27;s company, Schine Music, also provided songs to Lou Rawls and Bobby Sherman, among others. A musician himself, Schine had music he composed published. He once conducted the Boston Pops Orchestra in place of Arthur Fiedler at a concert celebrating his Harvard University 25th reunion in a performance of Sibelius&#x27; &quot;Karelia Suite.&quot; Some of the musicians refused to play for him and one commented later: &quot;That man ruined my father&#x27;s life. No way I was going to play for him.&quot; Schine&#x27;s post-production video house in Hollywood, Studio Television Services, handled clients such as HBO, Disney, Orion, and MGM/UA. His publicly traded research and development company, High Resolution Sciences, endeavored for years to bring high definition to broadcast television.

== Filmography ==
==Death==
Schine and Hillevi&#x27;s marriage lasted almost 40 years until their deaths together in 1996 in a private plane accident. Schine, 68, and Hillevi, 62, died on June 19, 1996, along with their 34-year-old son Berndt, who was piloting the plane that crashed in Burbank, California. They were buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
* A documentary film, &quot;Point of Order!&quot; (1964), was edited by Emile de Antonio from the kinescope recordings of the Army-McCarthy hearings.
* In the 1992 HBO film &quot;Citizen Cohn&quot;, Schine is portrayed by Jeffrey Nordling.
* Following Schine&#x27;s death, playwright Tony Kushner, who previously wrote the Pulitzer-prize winning &quot;Angels in America&quot;, wrote a one-act play titled &quot;G. David Schine in Hell&quot;. The play takes place on the day Schine died and portrays Schine as he arrives in hell and is reunited with Roy Cohn, Richard Nixon, Whittaker Chambers, and J. Edgar Hoover.
*&quot;Where&#x27;s My Roy Cohn?&quot; (2019)
* Schine appears in the first five episodes of the 2023 Showtime miniseries &quot;Fellow Travelers&quot;, portrayed by Matt Visser.

<text>Liamine Zéroual ( ALA-LC: &quot;al-Yamīn Zarwāl&quot;; Berber: Lyamin Ẓerwal; born 3 July 1941) is an Algerian politician who was the sixth President of Algeria from 30 January 1994 to 27 April 1999.

==Biography==
He was born in Batna and joined the National Liberation Army in 1957, at the age of 16, to fight French rule of Algeria. After independence, he received training in Cairo, Egypt, then Moscow, Soviet Union (1965-1966) and finally Paris. In 1975, he took command of a military school in Batna, then in 1981 of the Cherchell Military Academy. He was then made commander of the Tamanrasset military region in 1982, then the 3rd Military Region on the Moroccan border in 1984, then that of Constantine in 1987. He became a general in 1988, then head of ground forces in 1989.

After disagreeing with President Chadli Bendjedid about proposals for army reorganisation, he left the ANP in 1989, and briefly became ambassador to Romania. However, after Bendjedid&#x27;s forced resignation in January 1992, his career prospects became more promising. In July 1993, he became Minister of Defense; in January 1994 he was promoted to head of the High Council of State. In November 1995, he was elected President, a post which he retained until the next elections. He was reputed to be politically dialoguist, supporting a partly negotiated solution to the Algerian Civil War. On 25 December 1994 Zéroual reluctantly allowed hijacked Air France Flight 8969 to leave Algerian territory after 3 civilians, including a French embassy chef, were murdered by the four hijackers.

Although some urged Zéroual to run in the 2009 presidential election, he said in a published statement on 14 January 2009 that he would not run, while also suggesting that it was not in the best interests of democracy for President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a third term.

<doc id="410295" wikidata="Q1011521" url="?curid=410295" title="Burntisland">
<text>Burntisland ( , ) is a former Royal burgh and parish in Fife, Scotland, on the northern shore of the Firth of Forth. It was previously known as Wester Kinghorn or Little Kinghorn. The town has a population of 6,269 (2011).

Burntisland is known locally for its award-winning sandy beach, the 15th-century Rossend Castle, as well as the traditional summer fair and Highland games day. To the north of the town a hill called The Binn is a landmark of the Fife coastline; a volcanic plug, it rises above sea level.

==History==

Early evidence of human activity in this area has been found in rock carvings on the Binn, thought to be about 4,000 years old. The Roman commander Agricola may have used the natural harbour and set up camp at the nearby Dunearn Hill in AD 83.

The earliest historical record of the town was in the 12th century, when the monks of Dunfermline Abbey owned the harbour and neighbouring lands. The settlement was known as &quot;Wester Kinghorn&quot; or &quot;Little Kinghorn&quot; and developed as a fishing hamlet to provide food for the inhabitants of Rossend Castle. The harbour was then sold to James V by the abbots of Dunfermline Abbey in exchange for a parcel of land. The land was granted royal burgh status by James V in 1541. When the status was confirmed in 1586, the settlement gained independence from the barony of Kinghorn and was renamed Burntisland, possibly a nickname from the burning of fishermens&#x27; huts on an islet now incorporated into the docks. However, Ross (2007) considers this explanation of the town&#x27;s name &quot;implausible&quot; and proposes the origin &quot;Burnet&#x27;s Land&quot; after a local personal name.

Substantial remains of the original parish church, built in the late 12th century, survive in a churchyard to the north of the old town on Church Street. The building of a town wall to both north and east in the post-Flodden world of late 16th century Scotland, which placed the old church outwith the protective wall, was one of the several reasons that a new church was built in 1592: Burntisland Parish Church, also known as St Columba&#x27;s. This was the first new parish church built in Scotland after the Reformation. It is a unique shape, square with a central tower upheld on pillars, and lined all round with galleries, to allow the greatest number of people to be reached by the minister&#x27;s words during the service. The church contains some carved wooden panels.

In 1601, King James VI chose the town as an alternative site for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. This was when a new translation of the Bible was first discussed, a project which James brought to fruition a decade later in the King James Bible.

The town was part of the lands of Dunfermline belonging to Anne of Denmark. In April 1615 there was a riot in broad daylight against one of her legal officers by a crowd of over a hundred women who took his letters and threw stones at him. The rioters were &quot;of the bangster Amasone kind&quot; led by the wife of the Baillie of Burntisland according to the Chancellor Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline, who supposed the women were acting at the instigation of the townsmen including the minister Mr William Watson.

Burntisland developed as a seaport, being second only to Leith in the Firth of Forth, and shipbuilding became an important industry in the town. James V improved the harbour in 1540 and named it &quot;Our Lady Port&quot;. In 1544 it was defended by three artillery blockhouses. An English report mentions a dock at Burntisland called the Newhaven and says a pier and the three blockhouses were to the west, at &quot;Mill Dame&quot;. During the war of the Rough Wooing in 1548 the English commander Edward Clinton planned to reconstruct the harbour and pier and their defences, employing a military engineer. In 1559, the town came under French occupation when Scottish Protestant leaders opposed the Catholic Mary of Guise. The occupation ended with the arrival of an English fleet in 1560, prompting the occupiers to retreat by land, back to Leith. The harbour at this time was dry at low-tide and ships lay in the &quot;ooze&quot; or mud.

In 1622 a leaking Spanish ship entered the harbour and promptly sank. The crew said they were whalers, and they had whaling equipment, but the town baillies were suspicious and imprisoned the officers in the tolbooth and put the rest under house arrest under suspicion of piracy. The lawyer Thomas Hamilton arranged their release, arguing they had committed no crime and there was peace with Spain at the time. The town also became a major embarkation point for Scottish soldiers on their way to fight in the Thirty Years War, in October 1627 the Burgh Council complained to the Scottish Privy Council about the conduct of these troops. In 1633 a barge, the &quot;Blessing of Burntisland&quot;, carrying Charles I and his entourage&#x27;s baggage from Burntisland to Leith sank with the loss of Charles&#x27; treasure.

In 1638, the town like much of the country rallied behind the cause of the National Covenant in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The town with its good harbour became a magazine and supply depot for the Army of the Covenant.

Burntisland was held by the Jacobite army for over two months during the rising known as the Fifteen. The Jacobites first of all raided the port on 2 October 1715, capturing several hundred weapons, then occupied it on 9 October.

In September 1844 a new pier was completed to form a ferry link to the new harbour at Granton, Edinburgh. It was built by local builder Peter Penny (1803-1866). Burntisland Burgh Chambers was designed by John Henderson and completed in 1846.

Burntisland became an important port for the local herring and coal industries, and in 1847 the Edinburgh and Northern Railway opened from Burntisland north to Lindores and Cupar. By 1850 the world&#x27;s first roll-on/roll-off rail ferry service was crossing the Firth of Forth between Burntisland and Granton, enabling goods wagons to travel between Edinburgh and Dundee without the need for unloading and re-loading at the ferries. (Passengers however had to disembark and use separate passenger ferries). This operated until 1890 when the Forth Bridge opened.

The Burntisland Shipbuilding Company at Burntisland West Dock was founded in 1918 as an emergency shipyard for the First World War, specialising in cargo ships.

In 1929 the yard introduced the &quot;Burntisland Economy&quot; steamship, which was designed to maximise fuel economy. The popularity of this design helped the yard to survive the Great Depression. In the Second World War the yard continued to concentrate on merchant ships but also built three Loch class frigates: , and . By 1961 the shipyard had 1,000 workers but in 1968 the company got into financial difficulties. The shipyard closed in 1969 and was sold to Robb Caledon of Leith.
Robb Caledon eventually secured orders to for the yard to build modules for the North Sea oil and natural gas industry, and formed its Burntisland Engineering Fabricators (BEF) subsidiary to manage this work. Towards the end of the 1970s orders declined, in 1978 Robb Caledon was nationalised as part of British Shipbuilders and in 1979 Burntisland yard was closed. In 1990 under new owners Burntisland West Dock resumed the production of major offshore oil and gas fabrications. Industry related to North Sea oil remains important for the town. In 2001 a management buyout took over the yard as Burntisland Fabrications or BiFab. BiFab describes itself as the only major fabricator continuing in production in Scotland since 2005.

A plant for the refining of alumina was opened by Alcan early in the 20th century and closed in 2002, the land now used for housing.

==Church==

The pre-Reformation church (known as Kirkton church) lies on Church Street and served until 1592, at which point it was abandoned. It was ruinous by 1700 but was used for burials until the mid-20th century. The main body of the church serves as a burial vault to the local family Aytoun (Ayton) of Grange.

A new church, Burntisland Parish Church, was built in 1592 by a Dutch architect dedicated to St Columba on a small hill overlooking the sea. In 1601 it was the meeting place of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland due to an outbreak of plague in the usual venue in Edinburgh. Many attendees would have come by sea. The Assembly was attended by King James VI. It is said that it was at this Assembly that the King requested that a new version of the Bible be created: leading to the creation of the 1611 authorised King James Bible, which (after the Union of Crowns in 1606 represented both England and Scotland but was requested whilst the King was solely King of Scotland.

Ministers of the church in sequence were: John Brown (1567–1589); Andrew Lamb (1593–1596); William Symson (1597–1601); William Watson (1601–1616); John Michaelson (1616–1640, refused to sign the National Covenant); Andrew Lesly (1640–1643); John Smith (1643–1648); George Nairne (1649–1662, imprisoned); Harry Malcolm (1663); William Livingston (1663–1672, imprisoned); George Clerk of Crowley (1672–1688, suicide); George Johnston (1688–1691); James Pitcairn (); James Inglis (1692–1699); John Cleghorn (1701–1711); Henry Robin (1714–1718, left due to adultery); James Thomson (1719–1740, moved to Antiburgher Church); Robert Spears (1743–1773); James Wemyss (1779–1820); Charles Watson (1820–1837), father of Robert Boog Watson and Patrick Heron Watson; John Aikman Wallace (1827–1833); David Couper (1834–1843, moved to Free Church); Robert William Fraser (1843–1844); James MacKintosh (1844–1848); John Robin (1849–1873); James Edgar Hill (1873–1877); Robert James Cameron (1877–1879); John MacAlister Thomson (1879–1880, died in pulpit); Joseph Sage Finlayson (1880–1909); John Rogan (1910–?).

==Highland games==
Burntisland is home to the second oldest highland games in the world starting in 1652. The Games take place on the first saturday of July, the start of the Fife/Glasgow fair fortnight, and a local market and summer fairground takes place on the same day.

==Sport and recreation==
Burntisland Shipyard is the town&#x27;s senior football club, currently competing in the – the seventh tier of Scottish football.

The town is home to the eleventh-oldest golf club in the world – Burntisland Golf Club (the &#x27;Old Club&#x27;, as it is known among its members). Although it is not a course-owning club, its competitions are held over on the local course now run by Burntisland Golf House Club at Dodhead.

The Beacon Leisure Centre features a 25-metre swimming pool with a wave machine and flumes, as well as gym facilities. Opened in 1997, this replaced an open-air bathing pool which closed in 1979.

One of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails, the 187 km Fife Coastal Path, passes through the town. From Aberdour the route follows the railway line, goes along the High Street, and then heads towards Kinghorn via the beach promenade and A921 road. At low tide it is possible to walk from the beach across the sands to Pettycur before rejoining the route in Kinghorn.

==Education==
The town currently has one school, Burntisland Primary School, housed in a modern building which opened in August 2014 on the Toll Park. The school roll is around 690, which includes 160 nursery pupils. The adjacent nursery building across the road continues to be used. At its previous site on Ferguson Place the school first opened in 1876, and by 2000 was spread across five separate buildings.

The majority of secondary school pupils attend Balwearie High School in nearby Kirkcaldy. Catholic pupils travel to St Marie&#x27;s Primary School or St Andrews High School, also in Kirkcaldy.

==Burntisland Viaduct==
Immediately to the west of Burntisland railway station lies the 9-span viaduct forming a significant feature in the harbour area of the town. Built in 1888 to carry the main railway line from Edinburgh to Dundee, it is now a Category C Listed structure, being a rare example of a surviving Town truss.
==Attractions==
From May to August the annual summer funfair, known as the Shows, comes to town and there is also the second oldest highland games in the world, held on the third Monday every July.

The Burntisland and District Pipe Band compete in Grade 3B after being promoted from Grade 4B after a successful 2014 season. The band are 2014 British, U.K and European and World Champions. The band is known throughout for its development with children in the local area, creating players that now compete in Grade 1.

A free live music festival, Live on the Links, also takes place annually during the summer. First held in 1983 at the bandstand on the Links, it now runs for the whole weekend at different venues in the town on the second weekend in August.

==Transport==
The A921 coast road runs through the town and connects to the M90 motorway at Inverkeithing in the west and the A92 at Kirkcaldy in the east. The A909 travels inland towards the A92 at Cowdenbeath and the M90 at Kelty.

Burntisland railway station is on the Fife Circle Line and provides direct links with Kirkcaldy to the north and Edinburgh to the south. However, only the southbound platform provides step-free access.

The town is also served by Stagecoach bus service 7, which runs between Dunfermline in the west and Leven (via Kirkcaldy) in the east. The circular B1 service covers most areas of the town.

== Town twinning ==
Burntisland has been twinned with Flekkefjord, Norway since 1946.

<doc id="410300" wikidata="Q45848" url="?curid=410300" title="Brechin">
<text>Brechin (; ) is a town and former royal burgh in Angus, Scotland. Traditionally Brechin was described as a city because of its cathedral and its status as the seat of a pre-Reformation Roman Catholic diocese (which continues today as an episcopal seat of the Scottish Episcopal Church), but that status has not been officially recognised in the modern era. 

Nevertheless, the designation is often used, with examples being the City of Brechin and District Community Council, City of Brechin and Area Partnership, City of Brechin Civic Trust and Brechin City Football Club. Kinnaird Castle is nearby. Brechin is located slightly closer to Dundee than Aberdeen on the A90 between the cities. It is the fourth largest settlement of Angus.

==History==

In the centre of Brechin is a small museum in the Brechin Town House, and an award-winning tourist attraction, the Caledonian Railway. Along with the cathedral and round tower, part of the chapel of Brechin&#x27;s &quot;Maison Dieu&quot; or hospital survives from the Middle Ages; the Maison Dieu was founded before 1267 by William de Brechin. The Maison Dieu chapel is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. The Bank Street drill hall was completed in 1879.

The Guildry Incorporation of Brechin was formed in 1629 by merchants and traders in the Burgh and in 1666 obtained recognition of its rights under Decree of the Convention of Burghs. The Guildry&#x27;s historic purposes have been assumed by local government and its current functions are social and civic. On 19 October 2023, residents of the town were evacuated due to Storm Babet.

==Religion==
===Brechin Cathedral===

The town is well known for its cathedral, with eleventh century round tower (Historic Environment Scotland), one of only two of these Irish-style monuments surviving in Scotland (the other is at Abernethy, Perthshire). The tower was originally free-standing, but is now incorporated in the framework of the cathedral.

The cathedral has been much altered, but still contains medieval work of the 13th and 14th centuries, notably a handsome western tower and processional door.

===Scottish Episcopal Church===
In 1695, following the Glorious Revolution, the town&#x27;s Episcopalians were driven out of Brechin Cathedral which remained under the control of the Church of Scotland. A meeting house was set up in the High Street with a chapel being built in 1743. Following the Jacobite rising of 1745, the chapel&#x27;s seats and books were destroyed by government forces and the chapel was taken over by a qualified congregation. 

A new Episcopalian Church, St Andrews Church was built in 1809 and consecrated in June 1811. This was replaced by a new building in 1888. St Andrews Church is part of the Diocese of Brechin and its archives are held by the University of Dundee.

==Governance==
Brechin is represented within Angus Council by three councillors who represent the Brechin &amp; Edzell ward. In the Scottish Parliament, it is part of the Angus North and Mearns constituency and the North East Scotland electoral region. In the UK Parliament, it is part of the Angus and Perthshire Glens constituency.

==Education==
Education in Brechin is managed by the Education Department of Angus Council. There is one secondary school in the area; Brechin High School and four feeder primary schools; Andover Primary school, Edzell Primary School, Maisondieu Primary School and Stracathro Primary School.

== Public services ==
Brechin Infirmary was designed by local architect William Fettis (or Fettes) and opened in 1869 by Fox Maule-Ramsay, 11th Earl of Dalhousie. On opening, the hospital had beds for up to 30 patients. Four new wards were added in a major extension built circa 1929 and further expansion took place in 1960 when new out-patients and physiotherapy departments were included within a separate new single-storey building. The infirmary closed in 2015 and looks set to be demolished. A parochial lodging house for paupers (a poor house) was opened in grounds next to the infirmary in 1880. It had accommodation for eighty persons in eleven wards. Renamed St Drostan&#x27;s House, it was later used by Angus Council as a care home for the elderly.
==Sport==
Brechin City F.C. contest in the Highland Football League at its stadium Glebe Park. Glebe Park is the only senior football ground in Europe which has a hedge along one of its perimeters. Brechin is also home to the junior football club Brechin Victoria who play at Victoria Park.

Brechin Golf Club was formed in 1893, at Trinity Muir with a 9 hole course. Records show that by 1924 an agreement had been made to purchase Limefield Farm. In 1926, the famous James Braid was invited to play the course. Braid was so impressed he suggested suitable sites for sand bunkers in the Limefield section of the course. The course was expanded to the current layout to mark its centenary year in June 1993.

== Transport ==
The nearest National Rail station is at , which is a stop on the Dundee–Aberdeen line. The town was previously served by Brechin railway station, a terminus of several lines. It was closed to passengers in 1952, but has since reopened as part of the Caledonian Railway heritage line. 

Local bus services are operated predominantly by Stagecoach East Scotland. Key routes connect the town with Arbroath, Dundee and Montrose.

The single-carriageway bypass of Brechin was dualled and reopened in March 1994, completing the upgrade of the newly numbered A90 between Perth and Aberdeen.

<doc id="410306" wikidata="Q1013606" url="?curid=410306" title="Burghead">
<text>Burghead ( or &quot;The Broch&quot;, ) is a small town in Moray, Scotland, about north-west of Elgin. The town is mainly built on a peninsula that projects north-westward into the Moray Firth, surrounding it by water on three sides. People from Burghead are called Brochers.

The present town was built between 1805 and 1809, destroying in the process more than half of the site of an important Pictish fort. General Roy&#x27;s map shows the defences as they existed in the 18th century although he wrongly attributed them to the Romans. The fort was probably a major Pictish centre and was where carved slabs depicting bulls, known as the Burghead Bulls, were found. A chambered well of some considerable antiquity was discovered in 1809 and walls and a roof were later added to help preserve it. Each year on 11 January a fire festival known as the Burning of the Clavie takes place; it is thought that the festival dates back to the 17th century, although it could easily predate this by several centuries. Burghead is often known by locals as The Broch, a nickname also applied to Fraserburgh in nearby Aberdeenshire.

A recent dig just beyond the boundary of Burghead at Clarkly Hill has uncovered Iron Age circular stone houses and Pictish building foundations, as well as silver and bronze Roman coins and a gold finger ring possibly from the Baltic region. Significant evidence of large scale Iron smelting has also been found, providing evidence that iron was probably being traded from this site. The National Museum of Scotland has carried out significant exploration which leads it to believe this is a significant site of interest. 

==History==

===Pictish fort===

This vitrified fort lies on top of a headland which commands extensive views of the Moray Firth. Originally believed to be Ptolemy&#x27;s Castra Alata, later &#x27;Ptoroton&#x27; and the &#x27;Torffness&#x27; of the Orkneyinga Saga, it is now known to be of Pictish origin and is thought to be the oldest Pictish fort. It encloses 3 hectares and is three times as large as any other fort of the same period in Scotland. It was defended on the landward side by three banks and ditches which were destroyed during the creation of the harbour and modern village; their age is therefore uncertain. Six striking carved slabs known as the Burghead Bulls were discovered during excavations. Dating to 7th Century AD, four of the originals are held locally in Burghead Visitor Centre and Elgin Museum and one each in the Royal Museum, Edinburgh, and the British Museum, London. Much of the fort was destroyed during the building of the village from 1805 to 1809. The Doorie Hill (see below), which marked the junction of the citadel and the bailey, is the only remaining piece of the southern ramparts. Lengths of the eastern and northern ramparts are also still visible.

===Chambered well===
The Burghead Well, which lies within the perimeter of the promontory fort, was discovered in 1809. It consists of a flight of stone steps leading down to a chamber containing a tank fed by springs. There is a frieze in the upper walls, a pedestal in the southeast corner and a sunken basin in the northwest corner. The chamber is high, and across with a wide ledge around the edge, and the tank is deep. The discovery was made during excavations for a possible municipal water supply after an elderly fisherman recalled a tradition of a well in the vicinity. Various additions such as re-cutting the steps and deepening the tank were undertaken, but the flow of water proved to be insufficient for the proposed new function. At the time of discovery it was assumed that both the fort and well were of Roman antiquity and it was described as a &#x27;Roman bath&#x27;. Later in the 19th century it was suggested that it was an early Christian baptistery possibly associated with the cult of St Aethan, but its origins remain obscure to this day. It is almost certainly of Dark Age provenance and clearly had some ceremonial significance. It is possible that its main purpose was as a water supply for the fort and may suggest a Pictish interest in water spirits. The well is a scheduled monument.

===Burning of the Clavie===
A fire festival called the Burning of the Clavie is held on 11 January each year, except when the 11th is a Sunday, in which case it takes place on the 10th. The event starts when the Clavie is lit on Granary Street at 18:00 and normally ends by 19:30.

In 1599, the Privy Council of Scotland made an order which provided that the first day of the year would be 1 January with effect from 1 January 1600, while retaining the Julian calendar. With the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, Great Britain, including Scotland, adopted the Gregorian calendar and elided 11 days from the 1752 calendar. Thus the day that would have been New Year&#x27;s Day in the old calendar now fell on 12 January of the new calendar. The Burning of the Clavie continues to be celebrated on &quot;old&quot; New Year&#x27;s Evethat is, in the new calendar, on 11 January.

The practice has survived clerical condemnation. On 20 January 1689, the young men of the village were rebuked by the church courts for &quot;having made a burning clavie, paying it superstitious worship, and blessing the boats after the old heathen custom&quot;.

The Clavie is a barrel cut down to , which is filled with tar and bits of wood. It is nailed onto a pole which is long with a specially forged nail. It has to be specially made to leave a space for the carrier&#x27;s head to fit between the staves (6 in all) and allowing him to rest it partly on his shoulders while he carries it. A group of about 15 men known as the Clavie crew, traditionally fishermen and headed by the Clavie king, take turns to carry the burning Clavie on a set route clockwise round the streets of the old part of the town. The Clavie crew stop to present bits of smouldering embers to certain households and the three public houses in the village to bring them good luck for the following year. There are also two set points where they stop to refuel. At the end of the route the Clavie is put onto a stone altar (which was not constructed until the 19th century) upon Doorie Hill, and more fuel is added, often setting the whole side of the hill alight in the process. The barrel eventually collapses and the blazing embers are scattered all over the hilltop before they are collected and given out for good luck, although it is said that in the past the embers were kept as charms against witchcraft, and to kindle the New Year&#x27;s fire on their cottage hearth. It used to be customary to carry the Clavie round every boat and vessel in the harbour, but this part of the ceremony was later discontinued, presumably because it became impossible as the harbour became busier.

===Ship building===
Alexander Stephen founded his company Alexander Stephen and Sons and began shipbuilding at Burghead on the Moray Firth in 1750. For Reference A Shipbuilding History 1750-1932 Alexander Stephen &amp; Sons Ltd. A Record of the Business founded about 1750, by Alexander Stephen at Burghead, and subsequently carried on at Aberdeen, Arbroath, Dundee, and Glasgow.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
* For primary education, there is just Burghead Primary School, a non-denominational primary state school in Grant Street in the centre of the town. The school educates in a nursery school and years 1–7. There is a school roll of 128. Students are grouped into three houses; Clavie, St Aethans and Torfness.
* For secondary education, free transport is provided to two schools in nearby towns. Students may choose to attend either Lossiemouth High School or Elgin Academy.

===Further education===
Moray College is located approximately away in Elgin.

==Notable people==

*Rev Prof William John Cameron minister of Burghead Free Church from 1932 to 1950

==Politics==

===UK and Scottish parliaments===
* Burghead is part of the Moray constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which returns a Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons, at Westminster.
* Burghead is part of the Moray constituency of the Scottish Parliament which has slightly different boundaries to the Westminster constituency. The constituency returns a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) to Holyrood. The Moray constituency is also part of the Highlands and Islands electoral region which returns seven regional MSPs to Holyrood.

===Local government===
Burghead is represented at The Moray Council by the Heldon &amp; Laich ward, from which four councillors are elected. The members elected from this ward as of 3 May 2007 are: Allan Grant Wright (Scottish Conservative and unionist), John Christopher Hogg (Independent), Eric Morrison Mcgillivary (Independent) and David Christie Stewart (Scottish National Party). Moray Council is currently controlled by an Independent/Conservative Coalition.

Burghead was previously represented at Moray Council by the Burghsea ward from which one councillor was elected under the first past the post electoral system. Since 3 May 2007 the STV electoral system has been used in local elections throughout Scotland, which means that Burghead is represented by several councillors in the significantly larger Heldon &amp; Laich ward.

==Population (demography)==
The population of Burghead in 1991 according to the 1991 Census was 1,495. Data from the 2001 Census showed Burghead&#x27;s population had risen to 1,640; however, mid-2004 estimates showed the population had risen again slightly to 1,680. The 2001 data makes Burghead the eighth-largest town in Moray behind Keith, Kinloss and Lhanbryde but ahead of Hopeman, Dufftown and Fochabers.

Males in Burghead make up 53.6% of the population; this is higher than the figure of 49.97% for Moray which itself is slightly higher than the 48.05% for Scotland. Males in Burghead do not outnumber females nearly as much over the age of 25 as they do under 25, as the number of males per female is significantly lower over age 25 (1.05) than it is under 25 (1.45).



===Other facts===
* Median age of a male: 36
* Median age of a female: 39
* Number of males per female (under age 25): 1.45
* Number of males per female (over age 25): 1.05
* Percentage of households where not all persons are in the same:
** Place of birth category: 25.42
** Religious category: 30.9
** Ethnic category: 1.07

==Economy==
Burghead and the Moray area in general are heavily dependent on RAF Lossiemouth, a Royal Air Force station, and Kinloss Barracks, a barracks for the Royal Engineers, which are located at roughly equal distances on either side of Burghead. Until 2011 Kinloss Barracks was also an RAF station, RAF Kinloss, and in 2005 the stations contributed £156.5 million to the Moray economy, of which £76.6 million was retained and spent locally. The stations have at one time been responsible for providing, directly or indirectly, 21 per cent of all employment in the Moray area.

Other sectors offering significant employment are local authority, construction and real estate, food and drink, transport, tourism, business services and wholesale/retail.

In the past fishing, particularly herring fishing, was a large part of the economy of Burghead. Langoustine fishing, mainly for the European market, now contributes little to the overall economy; in 2001, fishing accounted for just 2.12% of employment in Burghead.

There is a large malting plant located in the town and in 2009, a large modern distillery was completed at the junction of the Burghead/Kinloss B9089.

Just outside Burghead there is a large radio transmitter owned by Arqiva, the Burghead transmitting station.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Three roads converge on Burghead, the B9013, the B9012 and the B9089. The B9013 connects to the A96 (Aberdeen to Inverness) and would generally be used to get to Elgin, the B9012 connects to Elgin via Hopeman and Duffus, and the B9089 connects to Kinloss and to the A96 via the B9011 (Findhorn to Forres).

===Bus and train===
* There is a regular bus service (32) which connects Elgin via Duffus. The service is operated by Stagecoach under the name Stagecoach Bluebird.

* The nearest railway station is approximately away in Elgin. The station is on the Aberdeen to Inverness Line and generally only offers services to Aberdeen (90 minutes travel) and Inverness (50 minutes travel), though more direct services are available. Inverness station and Aberdeen station then provide services to the rest of Britain. All train services within Scotland are operated by ScotRail, who operate the franchise.

===Air and sea===
* The two nearest passenger airports to the town are Inverness Airport (INV) at approximately and Aberdeen Airport (ABZ) at approximately . Inverness generally provides services to the UK and Ireland whereas Aberdeen provides services to both domestic and international destinations. Aberdeen Airport is the second-largest helicopter terminal in the world and serves the many North Sea oil installations.
* Burghead harbour is mainly used by fishing boats and is regarded by Moray Council as primarily a commercial harbour but it is also used for recreational purposes. During 2007 the harbour&#x27;s North Quay received a substantial upgrade, financed jointly by Moray Council and the European Union.

==Sport==

===Football===
The town is currently home to two football teams: Burghead Thistle and Burghead United. It was previously home to another football team, the Burghead Anchors.

Burghead Thistle compete in Division Two of the SJFA North Region and play their home games at Forrest Park, just outside Burghead. In 2008 Thistle were awarded the Elginshire Cup without playing in a final after New Elgin and Lossiemouth United were both thrown out of the competition.

Burghead United compete in the Moray District Welfare Premier Division. United share a close rivalry with fellow Premier Division team Hopeman FC, based in the town of Hopeman about from Burghead.

Golf

Burghead &amp; Duffus Golf Club was founded in 1896, permanently closing with the onset of World War II.

<text>Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu (; 26 February 1838 – ) was a Romanian writer and philologist who pioneered many branches of Romanian philology and history.

==Life==
He was born Tadeu Hâjdeu in Cristineștii Hotinului (now Kerstentsi in Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukraine), northern Bessarabia, at the time part of Imperial Russia. His father was the writer Alexandru Hâjdeu, a descendant of the Hâjdău family of Moldovan boyars, with noted Polish connections.

After studying law at the University of Kharkiv, he fought as a Russian hussar in the Crimean War. In 1858, he settled in Iași as a high school teacher and librarian. In 1865, Hasdeu published a monograph on Ioan Vodă the Terrible, renaming him for the first time &quot;cel Viteaz&quot;—&quot;the Brave&quot;. The portrayal of this violent, short rule as a glorious moment (and of Ioan himself as a reformer) drew criticism from the &quot;Junimea&quot; society, a conflict which was to follow Hasdeu for the rest of his life. Still, Hasdeu&#x27;s version of Ioan&#x27;s character and his anti-boyar actions were to be reclaimed as a founding myth by Communist Romania.

In 1863, Hasdeu again moved his residence, from Iași to Bucharest; he began editing the satirical magazine &quot;Aghiuță&quot;, which ceased publication the following year.

===Scientific works===

In Romania, Hasdeu started work on the &quot;Arhiva historică a României&quot; (1865–1867), the first history work to use sources in Slavonic and Romanian. He also published the 1870 philological review &quot;Columna lui Traian&quot;, the best at the time in Romania. With the work &quot;Cuvente dân Batrâni&quot; (2 volumes, 1878–1881), he was the first to contribute to the history of apocryphal literature in Romania.

His &quot;Istoria critică a Românilor&quot; (1875), though incomplete, marks the beginning of critical investigation into the history of Romania. Hasdeu edited the ancient &quot;Psalter of Coresi&quot; of 1577 (&quot;Psaltirea lui Coresi&quot;, 1881).

His &quot;Etymologicum magnum Romaniae&quot; (1886) was the beginning of an encyclopaedic dictionary of the Romanian language, though he never covered letters after &quot;B&quot;. While the completed parts of the work do aim to be exhaustive, and are remarkably detailed, many of its entries reflect more of Hasdeu&#x27;s own vision than historical facts (in one famous entry, he claims to be able to trace Basarab I&#x27;s ancestry in a direct line to the Dacian rulers, with Dacia as a developed state that would have had, at times, dominated the Roman Empire—to the point where the single ruling family would have given Rome a large number of emperors).

Hasdeu got involved in the dispute over the Latin origin of the Romanian language. Being challenged by numerous arguments which pointed to the central position occupied by words of Slavic origin in the Romanian language, Hasdeu developed an influential verdict, deemed &quot;the theory of words&#x27; circulation&quot;. The conclusion he reached was that Slavic words were never as widely used as Latin ones, with usage giving the language its character.

In 1876, he was appointed head of the State Archives in Bucharest, and in 1878 professor of philology at the University of Bucharest. In 1877, Hasdeu was elected as a titular member of the Romanian Academy, and in 1883 he became a foreign member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 

===Other activities===

Hasdeu was a politician often at odds with the Romanian establishment. For example, he was placed under arrest for a nine-day interval after Captain Alexandru Candiano-Popescu&#x27;s &quot;Republic of Ploiești&quot; conspiracy (1870). Although he had been a staunch defender of the deposed Alexandru Ioan Cuza, he eventually backed the movement against him (led by Mihail Kogălniceanu), and was not opposed to the new &quot;Domnitor&quot; (future King of Romania) Carol I. 

However, Hasdeu was a Liberal Party activist (he was elected to Parliament on its list for two non-consecutive terms), and close to its most radical, republican wing—the one led by C. A. Rosetti. As the republican experiment coincided with worsened relations between Prime Minister Ion Brătianu and Carol, all Liberal Party members became suspect of involvement. Together with several Party leaders, Hasdeu was tried and acquitted.

==Last years and death==
After the death of his only child, his daughter Iulia, in 1888, he became a spiritualist and a firm adept of the spiritism. He retreated to a Câmpina mansion, and arranged it as a temple to his newly found beliefs and to his daughter. He died there and was buried in Bellu Cemetery, Bucharest.

His works include two dramas, &quot;Răsvan și Vidra&quot; (romanticizing the actions of an obscure 1590s Moldavian-Romani Voivode, Ștefan Răzvan), and &quot;Domnița Ruxandra&quot;. Between 1891 and 1892, he wrote &quot;Sic Cogito&quot;, a theoretical work of spiritism as a philosophy. In addition to his interest in science, Hasdeu was the author of many poems, usually short ones. The Romanian critic Mircea Eliade described him as a &quot;genius of an amazing vastness&quot;.

==Name==
&quot;Hasdeu&quot; is pronounced as if spelled with the Romanian version of &quot;ș&quot; (&quot;Hașdeu&quot;); Hasdeu never spelled it with any diacritic (most likely because the Romanian alphabet appeared and went through several major changes during his lifetime).

Although many times taken for a first surname, &quot;Petriceicu&quot; is in fact his second name. The confusion can be ascribed to the name&#x27;s uniqueness, and to the misguided assumption that &quot;cu&quot; is the same as the extremely common suffix for Romanian family names. The name was chosen by the writer himself, and it reflected the Hasdeu family claim to have descended from 17th century Moldavian ruler Ștefan Petriceicu.

<text>Banchory (, , ) is a burgh or town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is about west of Aberdeen, near where the Feugh River meets the River Dee.

== Prehistory and archaeology ==
In 2009, a farmer discovered a short cist burial to the east of the town. Archaeologists were called into excavate it and they found that it was a burial from the Beaker culture. Radiocarbon dating put the burial at sometime between 2330 and 2040 BC. Stable isotope analysis of the human remains indicated that he or she grew up on basalt geology, like that of the region, or on chalk, meaning they were either local or could have come from another place, like Yorkshire. Residue analysis of the Beaker pot found in the burial established that it had held either butter or milk.

== History ==
The name is thought to be derived from an early Christian settlement founded by St Ternan. It is claimed that Ternan was a follower of St Ninian. Tradition has it that he established his settlement on the banks of the River Dee on what was later to become the kirkyard of the medieval parish of Banchory-Ternan. The village and parish retained the name until the 1970s. The original Gaelic form is almost identical to that of Bangor, of similar meaning, and also the site of a monastery, in Northern Ireland. Relics associated with St. Ternan were preserved by hereditary keepers at Banchory until the Scottish Reformation. Two early Christian cross-slabs survive in or near the old churchyard on the site of the early church. One is built into a corner of the &#x27;mort house&#x27; in the churchyard, and shows two crosses incised in a worn pink granite slab. The other is a ringed cross in relief built into the wall facing the main road outside the churchyard.

Glen o&#x27; Dee Hospital was the first sanitorium to be built in Scotland. It was designed by George Coutts of Aberdeen and opened in 1900. It was constructed mainly of timber with a central tower of Hill of Fare granite. All rooms had balconies and verandas and faced south across the river. Access corridors ran along the north side. A recreation pavilion was later added to the south‑east, below the dining‑hall. On 13 October 2016 the former hospital was destroyed by fire. Two 13-year-old boys were later charged by the police in connection with the blaze.

From 1946 to 1986, lavender fields were in production in Banchory and the industry made the town world famous.

== Overview ==

Banchory is the largest town in the area and has a High Street. There are a number of hotels and restaurants including the Stag Hotel, Scott Skinners Bar and Restaurant, the Burnett Arms, and the Douglas Arms. The shops include newsagents, hairdressers and chemists. Since the 1970s, the town has grown steadily. Since 2001 there has been rapid expansion. A large forested area &#x27;the Hill of Banchory&#x27;, owned by the Burnett family (owners of Crathes Castle), to the north east of the town has been replaced by a large housing estate and an influx of new residents. The Hill of Banchory primary school was opened in 2006 to cater for the increased population.

Banchory Town Hall was completed in 1873 and the Kinneskie Road drill hall was completed in around 1908.

== Land use ==
Banchory Academy is a state secondary school, with a school roll capacity of 900.

The Banchory Sports Village opened in 2019 within the Hill of Banchory development area, with a 25 m 6-lane swimming pool, gym and sports hall.

== Tourism and culture ==

Banchory is known as the Gateway to Royal Deeside. Banchory River Festival used to be held every June: the main event is held on the Saturday in the Bellfield Park, Banchory.The Banchory show is held every July: there is an Agricultural Show, Dog Show, Craft Fair, Highland Dancing Competition and the Scolty Hill Race, as well as traditional fairground stalls and games.

Scotland&#x27;s only Rum distillery, Dark Matter Distillers, is located on the outskirts of Banchory.

== Transports ==
In 1853 Banchory railway station was opened on the Deeside Railway. The station was closed by British Rail in 1966. The town is on the Deeside Way, a shared pedestrian and cycle path which runs along the trackbed of the former Deeside Railway.

In 2017, the Banchory town service 205 was withdrawn. An internal bus was re-introduced in 2020.

<text>The Poggendorff illusion is a geometrical-optical illusion that involves the misperception of the position of one segment of a transverse line that has been interrupted by the contour of an intervening structure. It is named after Johann Christian Poggendorff, the editor of the journal, who discovered it in the figures Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner submitted when first reporting on what is now known as the Zöllner illusion, in 1860. The magnitude of the illusion depends on the properties of the obscuring pattern and the nature of its borders.

Many detailed studies of the illusion, including &quot;amputating&quot; various components point to its principal cause: acute angles in the figure are seen by viewers as expanded though the illusion diminishes or disappears when the transverse line is horizontal or vertical. Other factors are involved.

<text>The &quot;James Madison&quot; class of submarine was an evolutionary development from the of fleet ballistic missile submarine. They were identical to the &quot;Lafayette&quot;s except for being initially designed to carry the Polaris A-3 missile instead of the earlier A-2. This class, together with the , , &quot;Lafayette&quot;, and classes, composed the &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; that was the Navy&#x27;s primary contribution to the nuclear deterrent force through the late 1980s. This class and the &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; class are combined with the &quot;Lafayette&quot;s in some references.

==Design==

In the early 1970s all were modified for the Poseidon C-3 missile. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, six boats were further modified to carry the Trident I C-4 missile, along with six &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;-class boats. These were &quot;James Madison&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;John C. Calhoun&quot;, &quot;Von Steuben&quot;, &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot;, and &quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot;.

==Fate==
The &quot;James Madison&quot;s were decommissioned between 1986 and 1995 due to a combination of SALT II treaty limitations as the SSBNs entered service, age, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. One (&quot;Sam Rayburn&quot;) remains out of commission but converted to a Moored Training Ship (MTS-635) with the missile compartment removed. She is stationed at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia for inactivation.

<text>Ballater (, ) is a village in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on the River Dee, immediately east of the Cairngorm Mountains. Situated at an elevation of , Ballater is a centre for hikers and known for its spring water, once said to cure scrofula. It is home to more than 1400 inhabitants and has had a long connection with the British royal family.

==History==
The medieval pattern of development along this reach of the River Dee was influenced by the ancient trackways across the Grampian Mounth, which determined strategic locations of castles and other Deeside settlements of the Middle Ages.

In the early 14th century, the area was part of the estates of the Knights of St John, but the settlement did not develop until around 1770; first as a spa resort to accommodate visitors to the Pannanich Mineral Well, then later upon the arrival of the railway in 1866 it was visited by many tourists taking advantage of the easier access thus afforded. The Victoria and Albert Halls, opposite the railway station, were completed in 1895.

Ballater railway station, the former terminus of the Deeside Railway, was closed in 1966, but remains in use as a visitor centre with an exhibition recording the village&#x27;s royal connection. Many buildings date from the Victorian era and the centre of the village is a conservation area. The old visitor centre was substantially damaged by fire in May 2015 but has subsequently been restored and reopened.

==Glenmuick Church==
After the bridge over the River Dee had been built the village developed with a &quot;Centrical Church&quot; replacing the churches at Tullich, Glengairn and Foot o&#x27; Gairn which had become ruins.

A foundation stone was laid in 1798 and the first service was held on 14 December 1800. The church was designed by Mr Massey of Aberdeen and cost £670. It measured long by wide. Doors, at the east and west ends, each had a stair leading to a gallery. The building had four windows at the front and two gable windows, all glazed with plain glass. In the interior was a pulpit, a sound board, a latron and stair and rail. In 1879 a clock was manufactured by Messrs Gillett &amp; Brand of Croydon; the winding mechanism was electrified in 1982. A vestry was added in the early 1850s.

==Royal connection==
Balmoral Castle, the British royal family&#x27;s holiday home, lies west, and the family has visited the town frequently since the time of Queen Victoria. Birkhall lies southwest of Ballater. Victoria Barracks is used by the Royal Guard for the castle.

For decades, local stores had royal warrants bestowed upon them. Five years after the death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who had granted them, the warrants lapsed and, to the chagrin of many townsfolk and especially shop owners, they were not renewed. Shops which still display the arms marking the royal warrant include the butchers H. M. Sheridan.

In September 2022, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the cortège bearing her coffin passed through the village, on its way to Edinburgh.

==Climate==

A Met Office weather station collects weather data at Balmoral, just over west of Ballater. Like most of Scotland and the British Isles, Ballater experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. Its upland position means temperatures throughout the year are cooler than lower-lying areas, and snowfall more plentiful during winter months.


==Attractions==
Ballater is a centre for tourism in Royal Deeside, with the Cairngorms and Balmoral Castle nearby. There are two bike hire shops in the village.

The old Ballater station, containing Queen Victoria&#x27;s waiting room, was for many years a visitor centre with a replica royal carriage. However, the building was almost completely destroyed by fire in 2015. The rebuilding of the station, bistro and adjoining visitor centre was undertaken and subsequently completed in Autumn 2018. Balmoral Castle is a 10-minute drive from the village.

There are many walks from the village. For the easy going walker, there is Craigendarroch, a small, peculiarly shaped hill near the village. About 12 km (7 miles) south-west of Ballater is Loch Muick. From there experienced walkers can head up the prominent mountain, Lochnagar. Ballater is the home of many challenging walks due to the abundance of Munroes in the area.

There are many well-mapped cycle routes from Ballater into the surrounding areas, including the Deeside Way and a number of popular mountain biking trails. The forests at Cambus o&#x27;May have trails for experienced riders.

The River Dee flows through Ballater, and is famous for salmon fishing. 
Events in the town include:
*The Ballater Walking Festival each May attracts many hillwalkers of all levels. Participants are guided through the hills and valleys of the eastern Cairngorms.
*The Ballater Boules Challenge, on alternate Sundays from November to March each year, provides an alternative sport when the weather is not cold enough for the traditional game of curling.
*Victoria Week, held annually in August, is a celebration of Ballater&#x27;s connection with Queen Victoria and Balmoral Castle.

The village has its own &#x27;tongue in cheek&#x27;, on-line newspaper, the &quot;Ballater Bugle&quot;.

Recently five Ballater residents refurbished the Automobile Association&#x27;s Patrol Box at Cambus o&#x27;May, one of only an estimated 8 to 10 such historical call boxes remaining &quot;in situ&quot; in Great Britain.

==Transport==
There is a bus garage located near the village centre which provides an hourly public service to Aberdeen&#x27;s Union Square bus station. The bus company was granted permission to build a new site at Pannanich Road in December 2014. In April 2015 the former bus station was re-opened as a Co-op supermarket.

==Notable residents==
* Sir Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), biologist and botanist

==Government==
* In local government Ballater and Crathie share a combined Community council of 13 members.
* In the UK House of Commons it is represented by the County constituency of West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. 
* In the Scottish Parliament it is represented by the County constituency of Aberdeenshire West.

<doc id="410321" wikidata="Q1432452" url="?curid=410321" title="Overachievement">
<text>Overachievers are individuals who &quot;perform better or achieve more success than expected.&quot; The implicit presumption is that the &quot;overachiever&quot; is achieving superior results through excessive effort. In a teaching context, an &quot;overachiever&quot; is an educational label applied to students, who perform better than their peers when normalized for the instructor&#x27;s perceptions of background, intelligence or talent. In the workplace context, individuals who are deemed to be overachievers are those with the drive to complete tasks above and beyond expectations and who set very high career goals for themselves. The opposite term is underachiever.

==In educational settings==

===Primary and secondary school===
In an educational context, &quot;overachiever&quot; is defined as &quot;a student who attains higher standards than the IQ indicated.&quot; Overachievers are generally contrasted with underachievers, who perform less well than the instructor thinks they should given their intelligence. An Encyclopedia of Psychology notes that “[g]enerally, these terms are not used by either educators or psychologists.” While the concept of over- and underachievers has wide acceptance among practicing teachers, it remains a controversial topic on several points:
* Both are labels which implicitly affect teacher behavior. This frequently leads the labels to become self-fulfilling prophecies.
* The labels are based on a static and incomplete understanding of the nature of intelligence. The ability to concentrate and to work in a dedicated manner cannot be separated from a person&#x27;s &quot;native&quot; or &quot;raw&quot; intelligence in any meaningfully testable way.

A 2007 book about overachievement describes the &quot;cult of overachieving that is prevalent in many middle- and upper-class schools&quot;, in which &quot;students are obsessed with success, contending with illness, physical deterioration.&quot; &quot;When teenagers inevitably look at themselves through the prism of our overachiever culture,&quot; the author writes, &quot;they often come to the conclusion that no matter how much they achieve, it will never be enough.&quot;&quot;

This may also lead to a perfectionist mentality. Perfectionism is a personality trait that means a person who is constantly striving for perfection and approval of others and themselves. while it can be a healthy way of motivating oneself, it typically turns into an intense desire to not only succeed, but to specifically not fail. Perfectionists tend to tie their self-worth to their success, which leads to them overachieving in different aspects of their lives so that they are not rejected.

===Colleges and universities===
For college and university students, &quot;there is a fine line between being a high achiever and an overachiever.&quot; In the US, &quot;an increasing number of college students are literally making themselves sick in the pursuit of perfection&quot;, by setting &quot;self-imposed but unrealistically high standards.&quot; According to Dr. Modupe Akin-Deko, senior psychologist at Buffalo State College&#x27;s counseling center, &quot;… maladaptive perfectionists set themselves up for failure by setting impossible standards for themselves, thus lowering their self esteem when they never reach their goals.&quot; Clinical psychologist Marilyn Sorenson, in her book &quot;Breaking the Chain of Low Self-Esteem&quot;, maintains that people with low self-esteem often find themselves driven to overachieve to build self-worth.

==In the workplace==

In the workplace, &quot;overachievers have the drive, determination, passion, and energy needed to move huge projects forward.&quot; &quot;Overachievers increasingly take on new projects and drive themselves to perfection, often becoming known as &#x27;workaholics&#x27;.&quot; For workplace overachievers, &quot;completing tasks above and beyond expectations provides the same physical and mental high as a drug.&quot; However, managers need to deal with the negative side of the overachiever personality: the overachiever employee may &quot;set unrealistic expectations, work insane hours, and take risks to succeed at any cost&quot;, which can lead the employee to &quot;become obsessed, dysfunctional, and ultimately unable to perform.&quot; Other issues with overachievers are that they &quot;… typically forget to communicate vital information, often take shortcuts, and leave the details to someone else.&quot; As well, overachievers often &quot;have difficulties interacting socially&quot; and they are &quot;at high risk for burnout&quot;.

While there are several negative consequences, there can be an upside. When managed properly, those who are overachievers can be a great asset to their company. This is only a possibility if the company recognizes and understands that overachievement can be physically and mentally taxing to the overachiever and guidelines are assessed to properly take care of the wellbeing of the employees. 

According to &quot;Dr. Richard Rawson, associate director of UCLA&#x27;s Integrated Substance Abuse Programs, [methamphetamine] … is popular with workers in overachieving, highly productive economies such as those in Japan and South Korea.&quot; Methamphetamines &quot;have graduated into a formidable problem in the workplace&quot;; in the US, the California Bar Association &quot;says one in four lawyers who voluntarily enters drug rehabilitation programs is addicted to methamphetamines.&quot;

According to psychologist Arthur P. Ciaramicoli, there is a &quot;curse of the capable,&quot; which is &quot;a complex web of emotions that drives people to hide their genuine needs behind a mask of over-achievement.&quot; He claims people often seek &quot;the &quot;quick fix&quot; of over-achievement to compensate for wounded self-esteem.&quot; As well, he states that &quot;chronically-overachieving people often don&#x27;t realize unrecognized needs are driving them from the healing conditions necessary for fulfilled lives.&quot; He says that &quot;compulsive overachieving can stimulate production of dopamine&quot;; however these &quot;temporary &quot;lifts&quot; will pass, triggering a spiraling non-fulfilling cycle of achievement and disappointment.&quot; He claims that &quot;the drive for status to overcome psychological wounds generally leads to other problems such as poor nutrition, weight gain, excessive reliance on caffeine, alcohol or other harmful substances and sleep deprivation.&quot;

==Figurative usages of term==
The term &quot;overachievement&quot; is occasionally applied in other contexts; for example, a country with an unsustainably high per capita income might be described as &quot;overachieving&quot;. In sports, players or teams that significantly exceed the general preseason expectations for them are called &quot;overachievers.&quot; Promotional materials and reviews for consumer products sometimes refer to products as &quot;overachievers.&quot;

<text>Biggar ( ) is a town, parish and former burgh in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, in the Southern Uplands near the River Clyde on the A702. The closest neighbouring towns are Lanark, Peebles and Carluke.

==History==
Biggar occupies a key location close to two of Scotland&#x27;s great rivers, the Clyde flowing to the west, and the Tweed flowing to the east. Stone and Bronze-age artefacts have been found in the area but the strongest evidence of settlement occurs on the hills surrounding the town. One of these is Bizzyberry Hill where Iron Age remains dating back almost 2,000 years have been found. The present day A702 follows the route of a Roman road, which linked the Clyde Valley with Musselburgh.

In the 12th century, in return for the promise of support, King David I gave the lands of Biggar to Baldwin, a Fleming leader. He built a motte and bailey castle, which can still be seen north-west of the High Street. The first permanent crossing of the Biggar Burn was also built. It is thought that there has been a church at Biggar since the 6th or 7th century, although the first stone kirk was built in 1164, on the site of the existing kirk.

In the 14th century, the Fleming family were given lands in the area by Robert the Bruce, whose cause they had supported. The Flemings built Boghall Castle, visible as a ruin until the early 20th century, but now only represented by a few mounds. The town continued to grow as an important market town, and in 1451 it became a burgh. The market place remains the central focus of the town. The kirk was rebuilt as a Collegiate church in 1546 for Malcolm, 3rd Lord Fleming, the last to be established before the Reformation of 1560. The Flemings found themselves on the wrong side in the 16th century, when they supported Mary, Queen of Scots. Their lands remained in the Fleming family until the 18th century when the male line of succession ended. The lands passed into the Elphinstone family in 1735 on the marriage of the heiress Lady Clementina Fleming to Charles, Lord Elphinstone.

Biggar Gas Works opened in 1836, producing gas from coal. In 1973, with the introduction of natural gas, the works closed. Biggar had its own railway station on the Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway between 1860 and 1953.

In 1899 farmers, Thomas Blackwood Murray and Norman Fulton, located in Biggar founded Albion Motors as a small business which eventually grew into the largest truck company in the British Empire. The company still exists as part of the Leyland DAF group. The archives of Albion motors can still be found in Biggar.

In the summer of 1940 several thousands of Polish soldiers were stationed here, having been evacuated after the collapse of France. The singer Richard Tauber, whose wife Diana Napier was working with the Polish Red Cross, put on a special performance of the operetta The Land of Smiles during a two-week run in Glasgow. Later the Polish soldiers moved to the east coast of Scotland to defend the coast and to train for their deployment as the 1st Polish Armoured Division in Normandy, Belgium and the Netherlands.

The fictional Midculter, which features in Dorothy Dunnett&#x27;s &quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot; novels, is set here.

== Features ==

The town was once served by the Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway, which ran from the Caledonian Railway (now the West Coast Main Line) at Symington to join the Peebles Railway at Peebles. The station and signal box are still standing but housing has been built on the line running west from the station and the railway running east from the station is a public footpath to Broughton, part of the Biggar Country Path network.
This town has two schools, one primary, and one secondary. The secondary school, Biggar High School, also admits pupils from surrounding small towns and villages. Biggar Primary is a small school, located on South Back Road, with a current roll of 238 pupils. The High School, located on John&#x27;s Loan and adjacent to the primary, shares its sports facilities with the primary school when the occasion demands it. The annual primary Sports Day is held on the High School playing field.

In 2007 local estate agent John Riley, encouraged a group of Biggar residents to launch the Carbon Neutral Biggar project, with the stated aim of becoming the first carbon neutral town in Scotland. The launch of the project, covered in both local and national media, took place at the town&#x27;s annual eco forum in May 2007. The group has formed links with the town of Ashton Hayes in Cheshire, which has a similar group working toward carbon neutral status for the town.

==Attractions==
The new Biggar &amp; Upper Clydesdale Museum run by the Biggar Museum Trust opened in 2015 and the Biggar Gasworks Museum is the only preserved gas works in Scotland. Additionally, Biggar has Scotland&#x27;s only permanent puppet theatre, Biggar Puppet Theatre, which is run by the Purves Puppets family. Biggar Corn Exchange, now also used as a theatre, was completed in 1861.

Ian Hamilton Finlay&#x27;s home and garden at Little Sparta is nearby in the Pentland Hills. The town hosts an annual arts festival, the Biggar Little Festival. The town has traditionally held a huge bonfire at Hogmanay.

<text>Constantin Brâncoveanu (; 1654 – August 15, 1714) was Prince of Wallachia between 1688 and 1714.

==Biography==

===Ascension===
A descendant of the Craiovești boyar family and heir through his grandfather Preda of a considerable part of Matei Basarab′s fortune, Brâncoveanu was born on the estate of Brâncoveni and raised in the house of his uncle, &quot;stolnic&quot; Constantin Cantacuzino. He rose to the throne after the death of his uncle, prince Şerban Cantacuzino. He was initially supported by his maternal uncles Constantin and Mihai Cantacuzino, but grew increasingly independent from them in the course of his reign. Constantin Cantacuzino retreated to one of his estates and began advocating his son Ștefan&#x27;s candidacy to the throne.

===Policies===
The prince took steps in negotiating anti-Ottoman alliances first with the Habsburg monarchy, and then with Peter the Great&#x27;s Russia (&quot;see Russo-Turkish War, 1710-1711&quot;): upon the 1710 Russian intervention in Moldavia, the prince contacted Tsar Peter and accepted gifts from the latter, while his rivalry with the Moldavian Prince Dimitrie Cantemir (the main regional ally of the Russians) prevented a more decisive political move. Instead, Brâncoveanu gathered Wallachian troops in Urlați, near the Moldavian border, awaiting for Russian troops to storm into his country and offer his services to the tsar, while also readying to join the Ottoman counter-offensive in the event of a change in fortunes. When several of his boyars fled to the Russian camp, the prince saw himself forced to decide in favor of the Ottomans or risk becoming an enemy of his Ottoman suzerain, and swiftly returned the gifts he had received from the Russians.

===Arrest and execution===
Such policies were eventually denounced to the Porte. Brâncoveanu was deposed from his throne by Sultan Ahmed III, and brought under arrest to Istanbul, where he was imprisoned in 1714 at the fortress of Yedikule (&quot;the Seven Towers&quot;).
There he was tortured by the Ottomans, who hoped to locate the immense fortune he had supposedly amassed. He and his four sons were beheaded on the same day in August, together with Prince Constantin&#x27;s faithful friend, grand treasurer Ianache Văcărescu. Most importantly, Constantin and his sons were asked to renounce Christianity and join the Islamic religion, which would pardon them from beheading. They chose to keep their Christian faith.

According to his secretary, Anton Maria Del Chiaro, their heads were then carried on poles through the streets of Istanbul, an episode which caused a great unrest in the city. Fearing a rebellion, including from that of the Muslim population which was outraged by the injustice done to the Prince, his sons and his close friend, he ordered for the bodies to be thrown into the Bosporus. Christian fishermen took the bodies from the water, and buried them at the Halchi Monastery, in the city&#x27;s vicinity.

===Death and sanctification in Eastern Orthodoxy===
The circumstances and facts of Constantin&#x27;s death are recorded in history, and his sanctification is recognized by all Eastern Orthodox Churches.

On 15 August 1714, the Feast of the Dormition, when Constantin Brâncoveanu was also celebrating his 60th birthday, he and his four sons and boyar Ianache Văcărescu were brought before Sultan Ahmed III of Turkey. Diplomatic representatives of Austria, Russia, France and England were also present. After all of his fortune had been seized, in exchange for the life of his family he was asked to renounce the Orthodox Christian faith. He reportedly said: &quot;Behold, all my fortunes and all I had, I have lost! Let us not lose our souls. Be brave and manly, my beloved! Ignore death. Look at how much Christ, our Savior, has endured for us and with what shameful death he died. Firmly believe in this and do not move, nor leave your faith for this life and this world.&quot; After this, his four sons, Constantin, Ștefan, Radu and Matei and advisor Ianache were beheaded in front of their father.

It is also said that the smallest child, Matei (12 years old) was so frightened after seeing the bloodbath and the heads of his three brothers that he started crying and asking his father to let him renounce Christianity and convert to Islam. At that moment, Constantin Brâncoveanu said: &quot;Of our kind none have lost their faith. It is better to die a thousand times than to leave your ancient faith just to live few more years on earth.&quot; Matei listened and offered his head. After Brâncoveanu himself was decapitated, their heads were impaled on javelins and displayed in a procession. Their bodies were left before the gate and later on thrown into the waters of the Bosphorus.

==Cultural contribution==
Brâncoveanu was a great patron of culture, his achievements being part of the Romanian and world cultural heritage. Under his reign, many Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Arabic, Turkish, and Georgian texts were printed after a printing press was established in Bucharest - an institution overseen by Anthim the Iberian. In 1694, he founded the Royal Academy of Bucharest.

In his religious and laic constructions, Brâncoveanu harmoniously combined in architecture the mural and sculptural painting, the local tradition, the Neo-Byzantine style and the innovative ideas of the Italian Renaissance, giving rise to Brâncovenesc style. The most accomplished and the best preserved example of Brâncovenesc style architecture is Hurezi monastery, inscribed by UNESCO on its list of World Heritage Sites, where Brâncoveanu intended to have his tomb. Other buildings built by him are Mogoșoaia Palace complex, Potlogi Palace, Brâncoveanu monastery. Such cultural ventures relied on increased taxation, which was also determined by the mounting fiscal pressure of the Ottomans (adding in turn to Brâncoveanu&#x27;s determination to strip Wallachia of Turkish rule).

==Legacy==

Brâncoveanu left to the secular Romanian spirituality a few fundamental books, printed for the first time in Wallachia; among them, Aristotle&#x27;s Ethics, the Flower of the Gifts and the Philosophical Examples, the last two being translated and printed by Antim Ivireanul. 
The neo-Romanian style was born from the style of the monasteries, of the houses and of the palaces of Brâncoveanu and it became, through Ion Mincu and his school, the national style at the time of the affirmation of the cultural identities of the nations of Europe in the beginning of the 20th century.

The architectural Brâncovenesc style is found in the churches of the Monasteries of Hurezi, Râmnicu Sarat, Doicesti and New St. George Church in Bucharest. Among secular buildings, the style can be found in Mogosoaia palace and the reworked Old Court. The Brâncovenesc style was revived in the 20th century in form of the Romanian Revival style, also called &quot;Neo-Brâncovenesc&quot;.

The Constantin Brâncoveanu University is located in Pitești, but it also has subsidiaries in Brăila and Râmnicu Vâlcea.

In June 1992, the Sinode of the Romanian Orthodox Church decreed the sanctification of Constantin Brâncoveanu, his sons Constantin, Radu, Ștefan and Matei, and vornic Ianache Văcărescu. On March 7, 2018, the decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church added these saints to the calendar of the Russian Orthodox Church. On 16 August 2020, Romania celebrated for the first time the day of remembrance of the persecution of Christians in the world. Although Brâncoveanu died on 15 August, his death was also remembered for having refused to convert to Islam.

==Historiography==

The intrigue marking Constantin&#x27;s ascension and reign is reflected in chronicles of the time, which are ideologically divided: &quot;Letopisețul Cantacuzinesc&quot; gives a bleak account of Șerban&#x27;s rule, as does &quot;Cronica Bălenilor&quot;; Radu Greceanu&#x27;s is an official account of Brâncoveanu&#x27;s rule, and Radu Popescu is adverse to Cantacuzino rulers.

Dimitrie Cantemir&#x27;s &quot;Historia Hieroglyphica&quot; is centered on the clash, and reflects Cantemir&#x27;s preference for Constantin Cantacuzino, who was also related to Dimitrie through marriage (despite the fact that Cantemir and Brâncoveanu have taken the same side in the conflict with the Porte).

Ștefan Cantacuzino&#x27;s brief rule saw in turn the downfall of the Cantacuzinos; he and his father were executed by the Ottomans, who saw the solution to the risk of Wallacho-Russian alliances in imposing the rigid system of Phanariote rule (inaugurated in Wallachia by Nicholas Mavrocordato, who, through his previous rule in Moldavia, is also considered the first Phanariote in that country).

Through his death, Constantin Brâncoveanu became the hero of a series Romanian folk ballads, as well as being depicted on some of Romania&#x27;s official coinage. According to the Romanian Orthodox Church, the reason for his and his sons&#x27; execution was their refusal to give up their Christian faith and convert to Islam. In 1992 the Church declared him, his sons, and Enache saints and martyrs (&quot;Sfinții Martiri Binecredinciosul Voievod Constantin Brâncoveanu, împreună cu fiii săi Constantin, Ștefan, Radu, Matei și sfetnicul Ianache&quot; - &quot;The Martyr Saints the Right-Believing Voivode Constantin Brâncoveanu, together with his sons Constantin, Ștefan, Radu, Matei, and the counselor [Enache]&quot;). Their feast day is August 16.

==Quotes==
*&quot;Letopisețul Cantacuzinesc&quot; on Constantin Brâncoveanu&#x27;s relations with the Habsburgs and Ottomans early in his reign (1690, during the latter stages of the Great Turkish War):


== Issue ==

Brâncoveanu and his wife Marica had seven daughters and four sons. Although all of his sons were murdered, many of his daughters had issue. Brâncoveanu&#x27;s first born, Constantin II, also had a son who survived exile and rose to be a &quot;mare ban&quot; (foremost state function in Wallachian political hierarchy, except for the ruler). The male line of the Brâncoveanu family became extinguished in 1832, when Grigore Brâncoveanu died without having any children of his own. Yet he adopted a relative (who was also a descendant of Constantin Brâncoveanu) and thus passed the family name on.

According to a genealogical study, roughly 250 of his bloodline were alive at the middle of the 19th century. Amongst them Gheorghe Bibescu and Barbu Știrbei (rulers of Wallachia and Moldova), famous revolutionary Alexandru Ipsilanti, Romanian Prime ministers Barbu Catargiu, Nicolae Kretzulescu, George Manu and Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino &quot;Nababul&quot; and historians Dan and Mihnea Berindei.

<doc id="410327" wikidata="Q258981" url="?curid=410327" title="Lugoj">
<text>Lugoj (; ; ; ; ; ) is a city in Timiș County, Romania. The Timiș River divides the city into two halves, the so-called &quot;Romanian Lugoj&quot; that spreads on the right bank and the &quot;German Lugoj&quot; on the left bank. The city administers two villages, Măguri and Tapia.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the toponym &quot;Lugoj&quot; has generated a series of controversies over time. claims that it derives from the Latin word &quot;lucus&quot; (grove, small forest). Iorgu Iordan, in his &quot;Romanian toponymy&quot;, accepts the origin of the name from the Slavic prefix &quot;lug-&quot; or &quot;luh-&quot; (swamp forest) and the Hungarian suffix &quot;-os&quot;. However, linguist Simion Dănilă claims that the name of the city has its origin in the word &quot;logos&quot;, a Banat doublet for &quot;rogoz&quot; (sedge, a hydrophilous plant). All these hypotheses refer to the swampy areas that once surrounded the city.

== Geography ==
Lugoj is located in southwestern Romania, in Timiș County, in the historical region of Banat and consists of the town of Lugoj and the villages of Măguri and Tapia. Within Timiș County, Lugoj is located in its central-eastern part. According to the National Territorial Planning Scheme, Lugoj is a second-tier locality – municipality of county and zonal importance at county level, secondary pole at county level, with a balancing role in the network of localities. It is the second largest and most important city in Timiș County, being part of the Western Development Region and the Danube–Criș–Mureș–Tisa Euroregion. Lugoj covers an area of 98.03 km2, of which 20.35 km2 in the build-up area and 77.68 km2 outside the build-up area. It borders Boldur to the west, Darova to the southwest, Victor Vlad Delamarina to the south, Gavojdia to the southeast, Criciova and Bârna to the east and Coșteiu to the north-northwest.

=== Relief ===
The territory of Lugoj belongs to the high plain of Lugoj and the hills of Lugoj. Located in the contact area of these units, the city developed on the lower terrace of the Timiș River, on both its banks. The relief unit in which Lugoj is located is the Lugoj Plain, which penetrates deep into the piedmont hills. The average altitude of the area is .

Most of the land on which the city is located has a flat relief, with a few elevations that do not exceed 2–3 m above the surface of the terrace. In the northwest of the plain there are the Lugoj Hills, which make the transition to the Poiana Ruscă Mountains. South of the Timiș riverbed, the territory of Lugoj extends to the floodplain of Cernabora, the nearest local tributary of Timiș.

=== Hydrography ===

The hills of Lugoj have a radial hydrographic network that comes from the mountainous area and goes to the main collectors: Bega (in the north) and Timiș (in the southwest). Overall, the valleys have a consistent character and have naturally detached long peaks with the same radial orientation. The configuration of the relief north of Fârdea, in the confluence area of Miniș and Gladna, allowed the location here of the Surduc accumulation lake, which, with an area of over 320 ha, represents the largest lake area of Timiș County.

=== Climate ===
From a climatic point of view, the Lugoj area is part of the moderate temperate continental climate, with influences from the west and south of the continent, characterized by mild winters and cool summers. Sub-Mediterranean influences are felt by relatively small thermal amplitudes and the appearance of a second maximum in the precipitation regime (autumn).

Cyclonic air masses are very common here, which, coming from the Mediterranean and Adriatic regions, cause thawing and early melting of winter snow. The average annual temperature is .

=== Flora and fauna ===
Regarding the fauna and flora, among the protected fauna species that can be found in the area are European bee-eater (&quot;Merops apiaster&quot;) and sand martin (&quot;Riparia riparia&quot;), found mainly on the valley and meadow of the Timiș River. Among the protected trees can be found the 70-year-old specimen of Banat black pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot; ssp. &quot;banatica&quot;) in the Catholic cemetery.

== History ==
The beginnings of the settlement can be established since the Neolithic period, the archeological excavations made on the right bank of Timiș and in the Dealul Viilor area highlighting levels of living of a population of shepherds and farmers dating back to the 4th–3rd millennia BC. The later epochs are represented archeologically by the bronze deposit discovered in the &quot;Mondial&quot; area and vestiges from the Iron Age and the Daco-Roman period signaled both in the city center and in various localities in the vicinity.

Lugoj first appears in written history in 1334, when a papal tithe record mentions a certain priest Martin of &quot;Lucas&quot;. As an administrative formation, the district of Lugoj, which also included the surrounding villages, dates from 1369, when it is mentioned as &quot;posesio Lugas&quot;. Later, in 1376, a document issued by King Sigismund of Luxembourg mentions the attribution of the fortress of Lugoj (&quot;castrum Lugas&quot;) to the count of Temes, and soon, in 1379, it appears in documents as a castle town, with Nicholas II Garai as chatelaine. Gradually, Lugoj becomes an important strategic and communication point in the medieval Banat area, due to its geographical position, in the contact area of the Tisa Plain with the Poiana Ruscă Mountains, at the intersection of the roads between Banat, Transylvania and the southwest of Wallachia, ensuring access to the Danube.

The 15th century found Lugoj under the authority of the count of Temes, but the settlement enjoyed a wide autonomy. The management of the town was entrusted to a knyaz, assisted by 12 jurors, the inhabitants having in addition to feudal obligations also military duties. Visiting Lugoj when he was count of Temes, John Hunyadi ordered the restoration and strengthening of the fortress on the right bank of Timiș, by building ramparts and palisades.

The merits of the Lugoj District in the battles with the Turks are recognized on 29 August 1457, by a diploma of privileges granted by King Ladislaus the Posthumous. A special moment during this period is the participation of the people of Lugoj, under the captainship of Count Pál Kinizsi, in the battle of Breadfield in 1479.

After the establishment of the Temeşvar Eyalet, the eastern part of Banat was organized in a separate administrative unit, Banate of Lugos and Karánsebes, dependent on the prince of Transylvania. The distinctive role of the town is confirmed on 7 May 1551, by Queen Isabella Jagiellon, who strengthens the old privileges by granting Lugoj the status of &quot;civitas regionalis&quot;, as well as heraldic signs – a wolf standing above the crown. The Banat of Lugos and Karánsebes resisted the Turkish pressures until 1658 when Ákos Barcsay, prince of Transylvania, asked the people of Lugoj and Caransebeș to accept the decision of the Diet of Sighișoara, subduing to the Turks. They soon occupied the town, bringing in a military garrison led by an agha.

The end of the 17th century finds Lugoj involved in the battles for supremacy between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans, the inhabitants supporting on 25 September 1695 the resistance of General , fortified in the swampy area southeast of the town. The battle ended with the defeat of Austrian troops by the Ottoman army led by the sultan himself, General Veterani being killed on the battlefield. The Treaty of Karlowitz, concluded in 1699 between the imperialists and the Ottomans, saw the fortress of Lugoj demolished; today, only a street called &quot;Cetatea Veche&quot; (Old Fortress) reminds of the former fortress. The plan of the fortress, made at the end of the 17th century by architect Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli, was also preserved, and the works for the construction of the University of Lugoj building revealed traces of fortifications, initially located between two arms of the Timiș. In 1661, Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi described the fortress as a &quot;square-shaped building, built of stone, fortified with palisades and surrounded by the Zeppel stream, with a gate to the east and a bridge that can be raised&quot;. The Turkish domination, for over 150 years in Banat, has left few traces on Lugoj, as well as on other towns on the edge of the Empire, which being subjected to a more tolerant regime, feel strongly the influences and temptations of the West, as a result of policies promoted by Habsburgs.

By the Treaty of Passarowitz of 1718, Banat came under Austrian rule, being declared a crown land, under the name of Banat of Temeswar, administered by the imperial court through General Claude Florimond de Mercy. In 1778, Austria ceded Banat to Hungary, and Lugoj became the seat of Krassó County. After the revolution of 1848, for a short time, it was returned to the possession of Austria, so that through the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 it was returned to Hungary, integrating into the dualist empire thus created. Starting with 1881, Lugoj became the capital of the new Krassó-Szörény County, created by merging the Krassó and Szörény counties, and in 1889 it was declared a municipality. The new statute brought a series of defining changes in the ethnic and religious structure and in the economic and cultural evolution of the whole area. Hungarian reformism made possible access to modernity in the fields of institutions, legislation and education system, imposing emancipation from the servitudes of the medieval mentality, the penetration of new European ideas and thus the shaping of social categories capable of receiving them.

=== German colonization ===
In 1725 the first settlers from Austria, Bohemia, Bavaria and Silesia were brought to Lugoj, dealing mainly with blacksmithing, carpentry and masonry. They were settled to the left of Timiș, in a strictly delimited area, where they built their houses, laying the foundations of &quot;German Lugoj&quot; (). The two localities on the banks of Timiș were the property of the Chamber, but each had its own administration. According to the 1786 conscription, &quot;Romanian Lugoj&quot; had 1,039 houses and 5,130 inhabitants, while &quot;German Lugoj&quot; had 203 houses and 1,446 inhabitants. In 1795, as a result of a decision of the Chamber, the two localities were unified, the leaders being elected alternately between Romanians and Germans.

=== Jewish history ===
Jews first settled in the town in the early 18th century, working in manufacturing and in running the transport system. They eventually adhered to the Neolog movement; a Jewish school was founded in 1883. Many Jews left at the end of World War I and the beginning of Romanian rule. Zionist activity began in 1919. In 1930, there were 1,418 Jews, accounting for 6% of the population.

During World War II, the Ion Antonescu regime economically sanctioned the Jews, sending male members of the community to forced labor camps near the Olt River and to the Brașov area. Four youths aged 14–15, charged with illegal communist activity, were sent to the Transnistria Governorate, where they died. Many Jews left after the war, mainly to Palestine.

== Demographics ==


At the 2021 census, Lugoj had a population of 35,450. It had a population of 40,361 inhabitants at the 2011 census, down 10% from the 2002 census. As of 2011, most inhabitants were Romanians (79%), larger minorities being represented by Hungarians (6.82%), Roma (2.3%), Germans (1.85%), and Ukrainians (1.29%). For 8.33% of the population, ethnicity is unknown. By religion, most inhabitants are Orthodox (71.66%), but there are also minorities of Roman Catholics (7.62%), Pentecostals (3.64%), Reformed (3.03%), Baptists (2.5%), and Greek Catholics (1.83%). For 8.63% of the population, religious affiliation is unknown.
== Economy ==
At the end of the 18th century, Lugoj was recorded as an important viticultural center, with 90% of the population owning vineyards. During this period, the population was engaged in agriculture, viticulture, animal husbandry and crafts. An important moment in the history of Lugoj is the formation of guilds towards the end of the 18th century, marking the transition to the future industrial system. The first industrial activities present in Lugoj were: milling (Elisabeth Imperial Mill, 1722), cloth manufacturing, blanket manufacturing, silk processing and brewing.

At present, the main economic areas in Lugoj are represented by: manufacturing (57%), trade (23%), transport and storage (6%) and construction (5%). In the local economy, the largest contribution to turnover is made by the manufacturing industry, which generates more than 50% of turnover at municipal level and concentrates more than half of the local labor force. The best represented fields of activity locally are those of the manufacture of ceramic sanitary ware, the automotive industry and the manufacture of electrical equipment. Over the years, two industrial platforms have been individualized, Tapiei and Timișorii. Among the most important companies present here are: Honeywell (protection, alarm and control systems), Autoliv (car safety products), Schieffer (plastics, supplier to the automotive industry), Hella (electrical systems and electronic equipment for the automotive industry), Villeroy &amp; Boch (sanitary items), Inter-Spitzen (fancywork), Schöller and Riva Intima (underwear), Rieker, Primos and Calzaturificio Torre (footwear), Agache (furniture), Werzalit (wood products), Gammet 2000 (metal fabrications for furniture), Lugomet and Silcom (metalworks).

== Culture ==
=== Music ===
Lugoj has always been one of the musical centers of Banat. Lugoj is also called &quot;City of Music&quot;. Mozart, Haydn and Schubert&#x27;s masses and other sacred music works were performed here while they were still alive. The Minorite Church was the culture bearer of the city. The oldest piano school in Banat also comes from Lugoj, founded in 1760 by a monk from the Minorite Church. The monks themselves dealt with church music, piano lessons and organ building. The Ion Vidu Municipal Choir has existed since 1810; in 1852 another choral society was founded under the direction of composer – &quot;Lugoscher Gesang und Musikverein&quot;/&quot;Lugosi Dal- és Zeneegylet&quot;. The cultural life of Lugoj has been enriched over the years with the activity carried out by the Chamber Music Society (1869) and the Philharmonic Orchestra (1926).

=== Performing arts ===

The first theater performance in Lugoj took place on 10 May 1841 and was a school theater performance staged by students from the local gymnasium. In January and February 1847, the Romanian Society of Theatrical Singers, under the direction of Iosif Farcaș, made up of several professional actors, presented the first performances in Romanian on the stage of the Lugoj Theater.

The current theater in Lugoj, named after tenor Traian Grozăvescu, was built between 1899 and 1900. The initiative to build the current Traian Grozăvescu Theater was made by Imre Jakabffy, count of Krassó-Szörény, who, after managing to get the land for the new theater, mobilized the local population who donated 24,000 kroner to build the theater.

During the interwar period, in Lugoj, several amateur theater societies were active: Thalia Romanian Theater Association, Banat Academic Circle, Musical Theater Society, which carried out a fruitful activity to promote the Romanian classical repertoire. It is worth mentioning that the Thalia Romanian Theater Association also took care of editing some collections of plays in one act, printing and disseminating, within ten years, almost 300 works.

Since 1992, the municipality and the theater of Lugoj have been organizing the only non-professional theater festival-competition with international participation in Romania.

=== Written press ===
Lugoj imposed a distinct coloratura in the landscape of Banat press in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with numerous German (&quot;Lugoser Anzeiger&quot; – 1852, &quot;Lugoscher Zeitung&quot; – 1905) and Hungarian newspapers and magazines (&quot;Krassó-Szörényi Lapok&quot; – 1879) published here, as well as valuable Romanian publications (newspapers &quot;Deșteptarea&quot; and &quot;Drapelul&quot; under the editorship of ). Currently, two local weekly newspapers appear in Lugoj, &quot;Actualitatea&quot; and &quot;Redeșteptarea&quot;.

== Education ==

The first schools in Lugoj are mentioned in the 16th–17th centuries. In the 19th century, a rich didactic activity is already recorded, in the gymnasium and high school, where the teaching was done in Romanian. The first Romanian school in western Romania was built in Lugoj in 1770.

There are currently 17 kindergartens, 10 primary schools and four high schools in Lugoj: two national colleges – Coriolan Brediceanu National College (former Roman Catholic lyceum) and Iulia Hasdeu National College, Valeriu Braniște Technical College and Aurel Vlaicu Technological High School, as well as Filaret Barbu School of Fine Arts. In Lugoj there are a School Sports Club, a Children&#x27;s Club and a Popular Arts School.

In terms of higher education, Drăgan European University, a private university with economic and juridic profiles, has been functioning in Lugoj since 1992.

== Architecture ==

Most of the buildings of historical interest are concentrated in Iosif Constantin Drăgan Square. The square is flanked by &quot;palaces for rent&quot; built towards the end of the 19th century. These large buildings consisted of ground floor spaces and owner&#x27;s home and apartments for rent upstairs. The prevailing architectural style of this period was Wiener Secession used throughout the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, combining the functional aspects with a rich decoration, but which did not aim to mask the constructive structure. One of the important public buildings of the city was the People&#x27;s Palace built in 1904 according to the plans of royal architect Armin Villanyi. Occupying one side of Iosif Constantin Drăgan Square, the building hosted the headquarters of the bank of the Greek Catholic community in the city and the editorial office of &quot;Banat&quot; newspaper. The Palace of the Reformed Community (1906) was also designed by Villanyi.

Along with the Secession style, you can often find buildings with an eclectic style combined with neoclassical and Art Nouveau elements. Thus, between 1895 and 1896, the building of the current Coriolan Brediceanu National College was built, which has obvious Austrian Baroque influences, between 1898 and 1899, the building of the current History Museum was built, the facade of which is decorated in Baroque style, and between 1899 and 1900, the theater was built in neoclassical style.

The Bejan Palace of the Athanasievici-Bejan noble family was built between 1900 and 1901 based on the project of architect Karl Hart in an eclectic and Late Baroque style, with elements of Art Nouveau architecture, being one of the representative constructions of Lugoj. The Parvy-Haberehrn Palace was built in 1897 in eclectic style and is several years older than the Bejan Palace.

The court building was built between 1901 and 1906 in an eclectic style, combining classical elements, pilasters with Doric and Corinthian capitals in the upper register. The former headquarters of the financial administration, the current City Hall, was built between 1903 and 1905 and is of neoclassical design, as it is the Muschong Palace. Muschong Palace was built in the period immediately following the union, around 1926–1927, by architect Aladar Ferenczik for industrialist Jacob Muschong&#x27;s family. The building was used as the Muschong family home, and on the ground floor were the brick factory offices and several shops.

The Palace of the Prefecture (located on the former Komitatsgasse), was built between 1843 and 1859 in the current urban ensemble Iosif Constantin Drăgan Square (historical monument ensemble) and functioned as the administrative headquarters of Krassó County (1860–1880), Krassó-Szörény County (1881–1919), Caraș-Severin County (1919–1926), as well as Severin County (1926–1950). It is a massive building in area, being one of the largest administrative buildings in Lugoj. The facade is imposing, with aspects of neoclassical architecture. Bought in 2016 by an Italian company, the building was transformed into a shopping gallery.

=== Religious buildings ===

Lugoj has 16 churches, chapels and conventicles, of which six Orthodox, three Roman Catholic, one Reformed and one Lutheran. A symbol of the city that also appears on the seal from 1793 is the church with two bell towers dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God. The construction made between 1759 and 1766, from the donations of the Romanian parishioners led by obor-knez Gavril Gureanu, follows a plan similar to that of the Timișoara Dome, designed by Viennese architect Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach. The bell tower in its immediate vicinity belongs to the old church dedicated to St. Nicholas, whose beginnings are uncertain, most researchers attributing it to the ban of Severin&#x27;s wife, Ecaterina Perian (1402). With the restoration of 1726 made by the obor-knez Ioan Raț of Mehadia, the tower on the west side is added to the church, with a bas-relief representing the face of St. Nicholas.

The Roman Catholic church was built between 1733 and 1735 by German settlers at the initiative of the &quot;Convent of the Minorities&quot; established between 1719 and 1722. Its interior ornaments and paintings are in the Baroque style, appreciated at the time throughout the Habsburg Empire.

The Greek Catholic cathedral dedicated to the Descent of the Holy Spirit is linked to the establishment of the Greek Catholic diocese based in Lugoj. Construction began in 1843 and was completed, due to frequent work stoppages, only in 1868 when it was consecrated by Bishop Alexandru Dobra. Made in neoclassical style, the church preserves the valuable interior fresco of neo-Byzantine influence made by .

The city&#x27;s current synagogue dates back to 1843, after the first Jewish place of worship was destroyed by the great fire of 1842.

From the contribution of the Roman Catholic parishioners of Hungarian origin, the St. Stephen&#x27;s Chapel was built starting with 1780. Later, at the beginning of the 20th century, the building of the Reformed (Calvinist) church was erected with obvious influences of the Gothic style.

== Transport ==
Lugoj benefits from primary connectivity to the TEN-T Core network via A1 motorway (Bucharest–Nădlac), passing through the north of the city. Also to the north, in connection with the A1 motorway, a section of about 11 km of the A6 motorway was inaugurated in 2013, which will connect Lugoj and Calafat. Lugoj is also served by a 9.6 km ring road, inaugurated in 2010. The network of streets in Lugoj totals about 99 km, of which 75 km are modernized streets. At the municipal level, 95% of Lugoj streets are paved.

Regarding the railway transport, Lugoj station is located on the CFR Line 900. With the commissioning of the Lugoj–Ilia railway, on 17 September 1898, Lugoj became a railway junction.

Public passenger transport services are provided by Meridian 22, established in 2007, on four urban lines: 1C (train station–Agricultural High School), 7 (Tirol–Banatului Street–I.C. Drăgan neighborhood), 15 (I.C. Drăgan neighborhood–Old Post–Tirol) and 17 (Tapia–Măguri–Agricultural High School).

<text>The Isle of Mull or simply Mull ( ) is the second-largest island of the Inner Hebrides (after Skye) and lies off the west coast of Scotland in the council area of Argyll and Bute. 

Covering , Mull is the fourth-largest island in Scotland. From 2001 to 2020, the population has gradually increased: during 2020 it was estimated to be 3,000, in the 2011 census it was about 2,800, and in 2001, it was measured at 2,667 people. It has the eighth largest island population in Scotland. In the summer, these numbers are augmented by an influx of many tourists. Much of the year-round population lives in the colourful main settlement of Tobermory. 

There are two distilleries on the island: the Tobermory distillery, formerly named Ledaig, produces single malt Scotch whisky and another, opened in 2019 and located in the vicinity of Tiroran, which produces Whitetail Gin. Mull is host to numerous sports competitions, notably the Highland Games competition, held annually in July. The isle is home to four castles, including the towering castle of Duart and the keep of Moy Castle. On the south coast, a stone circle is located in the settlement of Lochbuie.

==Geography==

Mull has a coastline of , and its climate is moderated by the Gulf Stream. The island has a mountainous core; the highest peak on the island is Ben More, which reaches . Various peninsulas, which are predominantly moorland, radiate from the centre.

The Aros peninsula to the north includes the main town of Tobermory, which was a burgh until 1973 (when burghs were abolished). Other settlements include Salen, Dervaig and Calgary. The Ross of Mull lies to the southwest and includes the villages of Bunessan, Pennyghael, Uisken, and Fionnphort. To the east lie Lochbuie, Lochdon, and Craignure.
Numerous islands lie off the west coast of Mull, including Erraid, Inch Kenneth, Iona, Gometra, and Ulva. Smaller uninhabited islands include Eorsa, Little Colonsay, the Treshnish Isles, and Staffa (of Fingal&#x27;s Cave fame). Calve Island is an uninhabited island in Tobermory Bay. Two outlying rock lighthouses are also visible from the southwest of Mull: Dubh Artach and Skerryvore. 

The Torran Rocks are a large shoal of reefs, islets, and skerries, approximately in extent, to the southwest, between the Ross of Mull peninsula and Dubh Artach. Frank Lockwood&#x27;s Island near Lochbuie is named after Frank Lockwood, the brother-in-law of the 21st MacLean of Lochbuie and Solicitor General from 1894 to 1895.

Part of the indented west coast of Mull, and some of the offshore islands there, are part of the Loch Na Keal National Scenic Area.

==History==
===Early history===

The Isle of Mull has probably been inhabited since shortly after the end of the last Ice Age, around 11,000 years ago. This is evidenced by radiocarbon dating done in a mesolithic hut at Crieth Dubh on the northwest coast of the island. Later, Bronze Age and Iron Age inhabitants built brochs at Dun Nan Gall and An Sean Chaisteal, and a stone circle at Lochbuie along with numerous burial cairns. Two crannogs there have been dated to the Iron Age.

In the 6th century AD, Irish migrants invaded Mull and the surrounding coast and established the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata. The kingdom was divided into a number of regions, each controlled by a different kinship group. One of these, the Cenél Loairn, controlled Mull and the adjacent mainland to the east. 

Dál Riata was a springboard for the Christianisation of the mainland; the pivotal point was in AD 563, when Columba, an Irish missionary, arrived on the island of Iona – just off the southwest point of Mull – and founded a monastery there from which to start evangelising the local population.
===Norse period===

In the 9th century, Viking invasions led to the destruction of Dál Riata and its replacement by the Norse Kingdom of the Isles, which became part of the kingdom of Norway following Norwegian unification around 872. The Kingdom of the Isles was much more extensive than Dál Riata, encompassing also the Outer Hebrides and Skye. The island kingdom became known as the &quot;Suðreyjar&quot;, meaning &quot;southern isles&quot; in Old Norse. The former lands of Dál Riata acquired the geographic description &quot;Argyle&quot; (now &quot;Argyll&quot;): the &quot;Gaelic coast&quot;.

In the late 11th century, Magnus Barefoot, the Norwegian king, launched a military campaign which in 1098 led the king of Scotland to quitclaim to Magnus all claim of sovereign authority over the territory of the Kingdom of the Isles. However, a coup some 60 years later, led by a Norse-Gael named Somerled, detached the whole of the Suðreyjar from Norway and transformed it into an independent kingdom. After Somerled&#x27;s death in 1164, nominal Norwegian authority was established, but practical control of the realm was divided between Somerled&#x27;s sons and the heirs of Somerled&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Crovan Dynasty. His son Dougall received the former territory of the Cenél Loairn, now known as Lorn, of which Mull formed part.
Meanwhile, the Crovan dynasty had retained the title &quot;king of the Isles&quot; and control of Lewis, Harris, and the Isle of Man. After a few decades, they acknowledged the English kings as their overlords, so Dougall&#x27;s heirs (the MacDougalls) complained to Haakon, the Norwegian king, and in 1237 were rewarded by the kingship being split; rule of the Hebrides was transferred to the MacDougall line, and they were made the &quot;kings of the Hebrides&quot;. They established the twin castles of Aros (in Mull) and Ardtornish (on the mainland, opposite), which together controlled the Sound of Mull.

Throughout the early 13th century, the king of Scots, Alexander II, had aggressively tried to expand his realm into the Suðreyjar, despite Edgar&#x27;s earlier quitclaim. This led to hostility between Norway and Scotland, which continued under Alexander III. King Haakon IV of Norway died shortly after the indecisive Battle of Largs. In 1266, his more peaceable successor ceded his nominal authority over the Suðreyjar to Alexander III by the Treaty of Perth in return for a very large sum of money. Alexander generally acknowledged the semi-independent authority of Somerled&#x27;s heirs; the former Suðreyjar had become Scottish crown dependencies rather than parts of Scotland.

===Lords of the Isles===

At the end of the 13th century, a violent dispute arose over the Scottish kingship between King John Balliol and Robert de Bruys. By then, Somerled&#x27;s descendants had formed into three families: as well as Dougall&#x27;s heirs (the MacDougalls), there were also the heirs of his nephew Donald (the MacDonalds) and those of Donald&#x27;s brother (the MacRory or MacRuairi); the MacDougalls backed Balliol, while the MacDonalds and MacRory backed de Bruys. When Robert I defeated his Scots enemies, including the Comyns and MacDougalls, he declared their lands forfeit, dividing them between his friend, Angus Og Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, and Christina MacRory, King Robert&#x27;s kinswoman. The latter acquired Lorn and some of the smaller Isles, but Angus Og, who fought beside King Robert at Bannockburn, was given the lion&#x27;s share: The Isles of Islay, Jura, Gigha, Colonsay and Mull, and the mainland territories of Duror, Glencoe, Ardnamurchan, Lochaber, Morvern and Kintyre. After Bannockburn, Alexander Macdonald, Angus Og’s eldest son, then still alive, was granted Mull and Tiree. Angus Og&#x27;s younger son John of Islay, became Lord of the Isles after his father&#x27;s and his elder brother&#x27;s deaths. He first married Amy MacRuairi of Garmoran, the heiress of the MacRory family, thereby consolidating the remains of Somerled&#x27;s realm.

In 1354, though in exile and without control of his ancestral lands, John, the MacDougall heir, quitclaimed any rights he had over Mull to the Lord of the Isles. When Robert&#x27;s son David II became king, he spent some time in English captivity; after his release, in 1357, he restored MacDougall authority over Lorn, effectively cancelling Robert&#x27;s grant to the MacRory. The 1354 quitclaim, which seems to have been an attempt to ensure peace in just such an eventuality, took automatic effect, splitting Mull from Lorn and making it subject to the Lordship of the Isles.
In 1437, the Lordship was substantially expanded when Alexander, the Lord of the Isles, inherited the rule of Ross maternally. The expansion led the MacDonalds to move their centre of power from Islay to the twin castles of Aros and Ardtornish.

In 1462, the most ambitious of the Lords of the Isles, John MacDonald, struck an alliance with Edward IV of England to conquer Scotland. Civil war in England prevented this from taking effect and from being discovered until 1475, when the English court voluntarily revealed its existence. Calls for forfeiture of the Lordship naturally followed, but they were calmed when John quitclaimed most of his mainland territories. However, John&#x27;s nephew launched a severe raid on Ross, but it ultimately failed. Within two years of the raid, in 1493, James IV of Scotland declared the Lordship of the Isles forfeit, transforming the realm into an intrinsic part of Scotland rather than a dependency.

Throughout this time, the descendants of the Cenél Loairn retained their identity; they were now the MacLeans. Now that John MacDonald was exiled, James IV restored the authority of the MacLeans over Mull. An earlier chief of the MacLeans had married the daughter of the first Lord of the Isles and received Duart Castle as the dowry; this now became the stronghold of MacLean control of Mull. The cadet branch of the family constructed a tower house at Moy on the southern side of Mull, while the senior branch retained Duart Castle.

Legend has it that the wreck of a Spanish galleon, laden with gold, lies somewhere in the mud at the bottom of Tobermory Bay. By some accounts, the &quot;Florencia&quot; (or &quot;Florida&quot; or &quot;San Francisco&quot;), a ship of the defeated Spanish Armada fleeing the English fleet in 1588, anchored in Tobermory to take on provisions. After a dispute over payment, the ship caught fire and the gunpowder magazine exploded, sinking the vessel. In her hold, reputedly, was £300,000 in gold bullion. Other sources claim the vessel was the &quot;San Juan de Sicilia&quot; (or &quot;San Juan de Baptista&quot;), which carried troops, not treasure. According to that account, the island&#x27;s chief, Lachlan Mor Maclean, struck a deal with the Spanish commander to re-provision and refit the ship in return for military intervention on the side of the MacLeans in their feud with enemies on nearby islands. There have been numerous searches for the wreck and its rumoured treasure from the mid-17th century to the end of the 20th century. No significant treasure has been recovered in Tobermory Bay.
Following the Scottish Reformation, the MacLeans became supporters of Protestantism. By the mid-17th century, they had become promoters of conventicles, opposed to king Charles II&#x27;s repudiation of the Solemn League and Covenant and supporting acts of civil disobedience. Though personally opposed to persecution of such people, Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll, was specifically ordered by the Scottish privy council to suppress conventicles within his lands, which included Lorn. The atmosphere of hostility soon spread to Mull, where opponents of the conventicles felt emboldened, leading to outbreaks of violence between the two religious factions.

In 1678, Campbell was specifically instructed to seize Mull and suppress both the violence and conventicles. It took Clan Campbell until 1681 to gain possession of the whole island. Campbell took charge of Duart Castle and ejected the MacLean leadership from Mull; they moved to Cairnburgh Castle in the Treshnish Islands off the north-west of Mull. Campbell&#x27;s own position was somewhat undermined when he instigated Argyll&#x27;s Rising against the reign of James VII. The loyalty of subsequent Campbell leaders ensured the Campbells retained possession of Duart (it was only after the Campbells sold it, and it had spent a century under other owners, that the MacLeans were able to recover it by purchase). Under Campbell pressure, shrieval authority was established under the sheriff of Argyll, which they controlled.
===Later history===

Following Jacobite insurrections, the Heritable Jurisdictions Act abolished comital authority in Mull and Campbell control of the Argyll sheriffdom; the Campbells could now only assert influence as landlords. Many castles that had been in the hands of the MacLeans (such as Moy) had been slighted by the Campbells or fallen into disrepair, but more comfortable homes were built nearby.

During the 18th century, the island was home to a Gaelic Bard, whom Father Charles MacDonald describes only as &quot;The Mull Satirist.&quot; The Satirist is said to have been a vocal enemy of the Jacobite Bard Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair and to have attacked the latter in many poems that have survived. When the Jacobite poet converted from the Calvinist Church of Scotland to the Roman Catholic Church, the Mull Satirist accused him of doing so, not out of serious conviction, but to curry favour with the exiled House of Stuart.
In 1773 the island was visited by Samuel Johnson and James Boswell during their tour of the Western Islands. Farming, fishing, and burning seaweed for kelp ash (used in the manufacture of soap and glass) were the main economic activities on the island until the 19th century. Tobermory was built by the British Fisheries Society in 1788 as a planned settlement to support the fishing industry. 

The Highland Clearances in the 18th and 19th centuries resulted in people being evicted to make space for sheep; and the Highland Potato Famine (1846–1847) encouraged mass emigration. These factors caused the population to decline from 10,000 to less than 4,000 and then to 3,000 by the 20th century; this had a serious impact on the economy. Despite this, several grand houses were built on Mull in the period, including Torosay Castle. 

In 1889, counties were formally created in Scotland on shrieval boundaries by a dedicated Local Government Act; Mull became part of the newly created County of Argyll.

The whole island became a Restricted Area during World War II. The bay at Tobermory became a naval base commanded from HMS &quot;Western Isles&quot;. The base and the Restricted Area were under Commodore (later Vice Admiral) Sir Gilbert Stephenson, whose strict discipline and ferocious temper earned him the nickname &quot;The Terror of Tobermory&quot;. The base was used to train Escort Groups in anti-submarine warfare. 911 ships passed through the base between 1940 and 1945.

Following late 20th century reforms, Mull is now part of the wider area of Argyll and Bute.

According to a July 2020 article in &quot;Country Life&quot;, &quot;The Benmore Estate occupies 32,000 acres of the Isle of Mull&quot; and includes Knock House, a Victorian hunting lodge where tourists can stay. Guests can book rides on the estate boat, the Benmore Lady. Much of the lodge was built by the ninth Duke of Argyll for his wife, one of the daughters of Queen Victoria; they married in 1871. Reports indicate that the Queen stayed there, as did others including Wordsworth, Keats, JM Barrie and Sir Walter Scott.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 Scottish census, the Isle of Mull had a usual residents population of 2,800 with 1,271 households. 
Including the offshore islands, the population of Mull was 2,996. 

 In the same census, it was found that 33% of the residents of the island were born in England, the most of all Scottish islands with a population over 1,000.


==Gaelic language==

In Mull and the adjacent islands Gaelic had been the traditional language since the early Middle Ages. However, the 20th century in particular saw a reduction in the number of speakers, with a significant fall (20%) in Mull after the Second World War. This was associated with strong emigration and abandonment of the language by the younger generation. In the 1951 census only 10 people said they could not speak English.

The following decades saw the beginnings of a revival. Gaelic medium education was introduced in 1996 after a long dispute with the authorities. A Gaelic-medium unit was introduced in Salen Primary School, followed by a second unit at Bunessan Primary School; the language began to be taught in the first two years of secondary school; and Gaelic playgroups were introduced. By 2006 it was found that, though only 10% of the working-age cohort spoke or understood Gaelic, language ability at school age was much higher. There was great local variation in the number of speakers, from around 25% in Craignure (&quot;Creag an Iubhair&quot;) to 4% in Aros. It has been argued, however, that in terms of language survival, there is reason for optimism in Mull.

==Tourism==

There is a small amount of farming, aquaculture, and fishing, and Forestry and Land Scotland has several plantations on the island. Tobermory also has one whisky distillery (Tobermory distillery) and from 2005 to 2009 had a brewery (Isle of Mull Brewing Company). Tiroran is home to the island&#x27;s other distillery (Whitetail Gin) which was established as the isle&#x27;s first new distillery in over 220 years in 2019. 

Tourism is now the mainstay of the island&#x27;s economy. The economy began to revive when construction of Craignure Pier in 1964 started to bring tourists. Ecotourism became popular from the 1990s, and the reintroduction of white-tailed eagles in 2005 became a particular ecotourist attraction. The island is one of the few places to see sea eagles; there were at least 22 pairs as of April 2020.

Isle of Mull cheese is Scottish cheddar cheese made from raw cow milk produced on the Isle of Mull.

Apart from traversing the Ross of Mull on the way to Iona, visitors typically spend time in Tobermory, visit Glengorm Castle and then enjoy one of the beaches. One report states that &quot;the south-west holds more white beaches, famous for their pink granite skerries and stunning sunsets, that are also perfect for kayaking&quot;. Accommodations for tourists include self-catering holiday cottages, a few hotels, and some campsites.

Tourism was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and into 2021. A September 2020 report stated that &quot;The Highlands and Islands region has been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to date, when compared to Scotland and the UK as a whole&quot;. The industry required short-term support for &quot;business survival and recovery&quot; and that was expected to continue as the sector was &quot;severely impacted for as long as physical distancing and travel restrictions&quot;. A scheme called Island Equivalent was introduced by the Scottish government in early 2021 to financially assist hospitality and retail businesses &quot;affected by Level 3 coronavirus restrictions&quot;. Previous schemes in 2020 included the Strategic Framework Business Fund and the Coronavirus Business Support Fund.

==Transport==

===Ferries===
Ferry links to Mull from the mainland include:
* The most-used ferry, from Oban to Craignure (approx. 45 minutes),
* Kilchoan to Tobermory (approx. 35 minutes)
* Lochaline to Fishnish (approx. 15 minutes).

Advance bookings are not required for the Kilchoan or Fishnish ferries; access to those two ferry terminals on the mainland side is via single-track roads.

There are also ferry links from Fionnphort on Mull to the neighbouring island of Iona and from Oskamull to Ulva. In past years there were direct sailings to Oban (calling at Drimnin, Salen, Lochaline, and Craignure), and to Barra, Coll, and Tiree from Tobermory. During the summer there was also a sailing to Staffa and Iona from Oban that called at Tobermory.

===Buses===
Buses are operated by West Coast Motors Ltd. There are routes from Tobermory to Calgary via Dervaig (Service 494), Tobermory to Craignure via Salen (Service 495), and Craignure to Fionnphort via Bunessan (Service 496). Limited services operate to Lochbuie and Gruline. West Coast Motors also provide guided tours around Mull, Iona, and Staffa, including boat transfers from Oban.

A minibus service also operates seasonally from Craignure to Duart Castle.

There is also a community-run service from Calgary to Salen via Ulva Ferry.

===Airstrip===
There is a landing strip for private light aircraft near Salen. There was a seaplane that linked Tobermory with Glasgow and Oban. The regular scheduled service terminated in 2009. Loganair operated a scheduled service to Glasgow in the 1960s from Glenforsa airfield, a grass airstrip constructed by the Royal Engineers in 1965 near Salen. The airstrip has been operated since 2014 by Brendan and Allison Walsh, owners of the adjacent Glenforsa Hotel.

===Tourist railway===
The Isle of Mull Railway ran from Craignure to Torosay Castle but closed in 2011.

==Schooling==
There is one secondary school on the island (Tobermory High School) and six primary schools. Salen Primary School has a Gaelic medium education unit. Secondary pupils (age 11–18) from Iona, Bunessan and Fionnphort in the south-west attend Oban High School, staying in an Oban hostel from Monday to Thursday.

==Communications==
Mull was connected to the mainland by a submarine telegraph cable between Oban and Grass Point in 1871. There were telegraph offices at Tobermory, Dervaig, Calgary, Craignure, Pennyghael, Tiroran, Fionnphort, Bunessan, and Iona.

The Post Office built an experimental wireless telegraph station on Meall an Inbhire near Tobermory in 1892.

In 2014, fibre optic cables for support of high speed internet were laid between Kilchoan (in Ardnamurchan) and Tobermory and between Dunstaffnage (near Oban) and Torosay. In February 2015 additional cables were laid underground between Tobermory and Torosay to complete the link.

==Media and the arts==

AM radio, broadcast from Oban, came to the island in 1930 and television in 1954. New AM radio and UHF television transmitters were constructed on Druim Mòr, west of Torosay Castle, in 1978. Digital transmissions commenced on 15 November 1998 and analogue transmissions ceased on 27 October 2010. The digital transmitters have 22 relays on Mull, surrounding islands, and parts of the mainland, collectively the Torosay Transmitter Group.

Mull Theatre is a professional theatre company based in a 2008 theatre production centre on the outskirts of Tobermory. The company commissions plays, tours throughout Scotland and beyond, and runs an education and outreach programme. It started at the &quot;Mull Little Theatre&quot; at Dervaig in 1966 and was the &quot;Smallest Professional Theatre in the World&quot; according to the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. The National Theatre of Scotland were in residence at the Mull Theatre in April 2009.

An Tobar (&quot;The Well&quot;), based in Tobermory, is the only publicly funded multidisciplinary arts centre in Argyll. Established in 1997, it is a centre for visual arts, crafts and music. With effect from 1 April 2013, An Tobar and the Mull Theatre were brought together as Comar.

==Natural history==

The Isle of Mull is a popular destination for naturalists and photographers for seeing some of Britain&#x27;s more elusive species.

Mull has over 800 species of vascular plant (684 native and 171 naturalised) including 33 species of fern, at least 18 species of orchid and 22 native species of tree. There are about 700 species of lichen, 571 liverworts and mosses, and 247 marine algae (seaweeds), making a total of 2,388 species of plant recorded from the island. In addition, more than 2,000 species of fungi have been recorded on Mull: Dennis and Watling write, &quot;When one speaks of the Inner Hebridean fungi one is referring to the floras of Mull and Rhum&quot;.

The island has 261 different bird species, including the white-tailed eagle, which was reintroduced to the nearby island of Rùm and migrated to Mull, where it now has a stronghold. Basking sharks, minke whales, porpoises, and dolphins are among the sea life nearby.

The island is home to a population of otters that live in coastal habitat, hunting during the day. The Mull Otter Group was established for the conservation needs of otters on the Isle of Mull.
The island also has several birds of prey, such as hen harriers, golden eagles, and short eared owls, all difficult species to see throughout the rest of the UK. Pine martens have also recently become established on Mull; based on sighting records and from resulting modelling exercises, it is believed the species arrived in 2004 through accidental transportation on timber boats from the mainland. It is unlikely that pine martens have ever been native to the Isle of Mull.

The Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust was established in 1994 and is a marine conservation charity that takes action through community based research and education. The Trust carries out long-term monitoring programmes on cetaceans in the Hebrides, by collating sightings reported by the public and running live-aboard research expeditions on their sailing yacht, Silurian. The Trust covers the west coast of Scotland, and is based in Tobermory, where it has its main office, Discovery Centre and the mooring of their research vessel. 

There are also a number of invasive species on the island, including plant species such as Japanese knotweed and animals such as feral cats and American mink that are believed to be causing damage to the indigenous species populations through competition and predation.
==Religion==
*Lochdon Free Church, built in 1852
*Mull Monastery of All Celtic Saints, a Romanian Orthodox Christian women&#x27;s monastery founded in 2010 in Kilninian.

==Sport==

The Tour of Mull is a road-closing rally around the island every October. It has been sponsored since 2005 by Tunnock&#x27;s, the Lanarkshire teacake and biscuit manufacturer. A five-year sponsorship deal with Beatson&#x27;s Building Supplies started in 2015.

There are several shipwrecks around the shores that offer scuba diving.

There is an Isle of Mull Cycling Club.

The Cross at the Castle cyclocross event is held annually at Glengorm Castle near Tobermory and features the World Santacross Championships and the Scottish Singlespeed Cylocross Championships.

Mull Runners organise a half marathon and 10K run each August between Craignure and Salen.

Rugby is played at Garmony (beside the Craignure to Salen road north of Craignure). The Mull Rugby 7s Competition takes place annually in May at The Isle of Mull R.F.C&#x27;s rugby club.

There are golf courses at Tobermory (Erray Park), Craignure (beside the Craignure to Salen road north of Craignure) and on Iona.

Mull Highland Games are held each July in the grounds of Tobermory Golf Club (Erray Park). Events include Heavy Weights, Light Field, and Highland Dance.

The swimming pool at the Isle of Mull Hotel, Craignure is open to the paying public.

Tobermory has some free tennis courts.

Football is played, mainly in the south end. Bunessan F.C. play a number of games during the summer, most notably against arch rivals Iona FC, the island just off the south west end. Bunessan F.C. also hold an annual 5-a-side tournament in July.

==Community initiatives==
Following research and community consultation in 1996/97, a development trust was created to identify key goals for the communities of Mull and Iona. Mull &amp; Iona Community Trust was formed in 1997 and published a &quot;Community Regeneration Strategy&quot; for the islands. They purchased the only butcher&#x27;s shop on the island (closed February 2010), created a community-run Countryside Ranger service, instigated various recycling initiatives, and provide a fundraising and training consultancy.

<doc id="410338" wikidata="Q299211" url="?curid=410338" title="Pierre Cardin">
<text>Pierre Cardin (, , ), born Pietro Costante Cardin (2 July 1922 – 29 December 2020), was an Italian-born naturalised-French fashion designer. He is known for what were his avant-garde style and Space Age designs. He preferred geometric shapes and motifs, often ignoring the female form. He advanced into unisex fashions, sometimes experimental, and not always practical. He founded his fashion house in 1950 and introduced the &quot;bubble dress&quot; in 1954.

Cardin was designated a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador in 1991, and a United Nations FAO Goodwill Ambassador in 2009.

==Career==
Cardin was born near Treviso in northern Italy, the son of Maria Montagner and Alessandro Cardin. His parents were wealthy wine merchants, but lost their fortune in World War I. To escape the blackshirts they left Italy and settled in Saint-Étienne, France in 1924 along with his ten siblings. His father wanted him to study architecture, but from childhood he was interested in dressmaking.

Cardin moved to Paris in 1945. There, he studied architecture and worked with the fashion house of Paquin after World War II. He worked with Elsa Schiaparelli until he became head of Christian Dior&#x27;s tailleure atelier in 1947, but was denied work at Balenciaga. While at Dior, he contributed the popular Bar suit for Dior&#x27;s inaugural 1947 &quot;Corolle&quot; collection, already displaying the deft tailoring that he would be known for in later years.

Cardin founded his own fashion house in 1950. His career was launched when he designed about 30 of the costumes for a masquerade ball in Venice, hosted by Carlos de Beistegui in 1951. Cardin inaugurated his haute couture output in 1953 with his first collection of women&#x27;s clothing and became a member of the Chambre Syndicale, a French association of haute couture designers. The following year he opened his first boutique &quot;Eve&quot;, and introduced the &quot;bubble dress&quot;, which is a short-skirted, bubble-shaped dress made by bias-cutting over a stiffened base. He was the first couturier to turn to Japan as a high fashion market when he travelled there in 1957. When Christian Dior died in 1957, Cardin was one of a number of young designers mentioned by the fashion press as possible successors to Dior&#x27;s enormous position in the fashion world.

As haute couture began to decline, ready-to-wear (&#x27;prêt-à-porter&#x27;) soared as well as Cardin&#x27;s designs. He was the first to combine the &quot;mini&quot; and the &quot;maxi&quot; skirts of the 1970s by introducing a new hemline that had long pom-pom panels or fringes.

Beginning in the 1970s, Cardin set another new trend: &quot;mod chic&quot;. This trend holds true for the form or for a combination of forms, which did not exist at the time. He was the first to combine extremely short and ankle-length pieces. He made dresses with slits and batwing sleeves with novel dimensions and mixed circular movement and gypsy skirts with structured tops. These creations allowed for the geometric shapes that captivated him to be contrasted, with both circular and straight lines. Cardin became an icon for starting this popular fashion movement of the early 1970s.

Inspired by space travel and exploration, Cardin visited NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) in 1970, where he tried on the original spacesuit worn by the first human to set foot on the Moon, Neil Armstrong. Cardin designed spacesuits for NASA in 1970.
Cardin resigned from the Chambre Syndicale in 1966 and began showing his collections in his own venue. He also designed uniforms for Pakistan International Airlines, which were introduced from 1966 to 1971 and became an instant hit.

In 1971, Cardin redesigned the barong tagalog, a national costume of the Philippines, by opening the front, removing the cuffs that needed cufflinks, flaring the sleeves, and minimizing the embroidery. It was also tapered to the body, in contrast with the traditional loose-fitting design, and it also had a thicker collar with sharp and pointed cuffs. A straight-cut design was favored by President Ferdinand Marcos.

In 1975, Cardin opened his first furniture boutique on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. In 1977, 1979, and 1983, he was awarded the Cartier Golden Thimble by French haute couture for the most creative collection of the season. He was a member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture et du Prêt-à-Porter from 1953 to 1993.

Cardin&#x27;s first American-made, mass produced home furnishing collection came in 1977 when Cardin partnered with Dillingham Manufacturing Company, Scandinavian Folklore Carpets of Denmark for Ege Rya Inc., and the Laurel Lamp Company.

In 1979, Cardin was appointed a consultant to China&#x27;s agency for trade in textiles, and in March of that year, he became the first Western designer to present a fashion show in China in many decades.

In 1981, Cardin acquired Maxim&#x27;s. He introduced Maxim&#x27;s to Beijing in 1983, where it was among the first international brands to operate in mainland China and became an enduring cultural landmark.

Like many other designers today, Cardin decided in 1994 to show his collection only to a small circle of selected clients and journalists. After a break of 15 years, he showed a new collection to a group of 150 journalists at his bubble home in Cannes.

A biography titled &quot;Pierre Cardin, his fabulous destiny&quot; was written by Sylvana Lorenz.

A documentary on Cardin&#x27;s life and career, &quot;House of Cardin&quot; directed by P. David Ebersole and Todd Hughes premiered to a standing ovation on 6 September 2019 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival in the Giornate degli Autori section, with Mr. Cardin in attendance.

== Eponymous brand ==
Pierre Cardin used his name as a brand, initially a prestigious fashion brand, then in the 1960s extended successfully into perfumes and cosmetics. From about 1988 the brand was licensed extensively, and appeared on &quot;wildly nonadjacent products such as baseball caps and cigarettes&quot;.
A 2005 article in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; commented that the extension into perfumes and cosmetics was successful as the premium nature of the Pierre Cardin brand transferred well into these new, adjacent categories, but that the owners of the brand mistakenly attributed this to the brand&#x27;s strength rather than to its fit with the new product categories. The extensive licensing eroded the high-end perception of the brand, but was lucrative; in 1986 &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; (WWD) estimated Cardin&#x27;s annual income at over US$10 million.

In 1995, quotes from WWD included &quot;Pierre Cardin—he has sold his name for toilet paper. At what point do you lose your identity?&quot; and &quot;Cardin&#x27;s cachet crashed when his name appeared on everything from key chains to pencil holders&quot;. However, the Cardin name was still very profitable, although the indiscriminate licensing approach was considered a failure.

In 2011, Cardin tried to sell his business, valuing it at €1 billion, although the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; considered it to be worth about a fifth of that amount. Ultimately he did not sell the brand.

== Automobiles ==

Cardin entered industrial design by developing thirteen basic design &quot;themes&quot; that would be applied to various products, each consistently recognizable and carrying his name and logo. He expanded into new markets that &quot;to most Paris fashion designers ... is rank heresy.&quot;

The business initiatives included a contract with American Motors Corporation (AMC). Following the success of the Aldo Gucci designed Hornet Sportabout station wagon interiors, the automaker incorporated Cardin&#x27;s theme on the AMC Javelin starting in mid-1972. This was one of the first American cars to offer a special trim package created by a famous French fashion designer. It was daring and outlandish design &quot;with some of the wildest fabrics and patterns ever seen in any American car&quot;.

The original sales estimate by AMC was for 2,500 haute couture &quot;pony&quot; and muscle cars. The special interior option was continued on the 1973 model year Javelins. During the two model years, a total of 4,152 AMC Javelins received this bold mirrored, multi-colored pleated stripe pattern in tones of Chinese red, plum, white, and silver that were set against a black background. The Cardin Javelins also came with the designer&#x27;s emblems on the front fenders and had a limited selection of exterior colors (Trans Am Red, Snow White, Stardust Silver, Diamond Blue, and Wild Plum) to coordinate with the special interiors. However, 12 Cardin optioned cars were special ordered in Midnight Black paint.

== Other interests ==
Cardin owned a palazzo in Venice named Ca&#x27; Bragadin. Although he claimed that this house was once owned by Giacomo Casanova, some scholars have argued that it was owned by another branch of the Bragadin family, and that its usage by Casanova was &quot;somewhat unlikely&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cardin self-identified as being mostly gay, but in the 1960s he had a four-year relationship with actress Jeanne Moreau. His long-term business partner and life partner was fellow French fashion designer André Oliver, who died in 1993.

==Death==
Cardin died on 29 December 2020, at the American Hospital of Paris, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, at the age of 98. No cause of death was given.

<doc id="410339" wikidata="Q314688" url="?curid=410339" title="Chadli Bendjedid">
<text>Chadli Bendjedid (; ALA-LC: &quot;ash-Shādhilī bin Jadīd&quot;; 14 April 1929 – 6 October 2012) was an Algerian military officer and politician who served as the third President of Algeria. His presidential term of office ran from 9 February 1979 to 11 January 1992.

A combatant during the Algerian War, he was a member of the Revolutionary Council from 1965 to 1976 and was appointed Colonel in 1969.

He was appointed Secretary General of the National Liberation Front (FLN) in January 1979 and was elected president the following month. Bendjedid would win re-elections without competition in 1984 and 1989. He resigned from the presidency in January 1992 following a disputed election and military coup, leading to the Algerian Civil War.

He remained under house arrest until 1999 and died of cancer in 2012 at the age of 83.

==Career==
===Early life and career===

Bendjedid was born in Bouteldja on 14 April 1929. He served in the French Army as a non-commissioned officer and fought in Indochina. He defected to the National Liberation Front (FLN) at the beginning of the Algerian War of Independence in 1954. A protégé of Houari Boumediene, Bendjedid was rewarded with the command of the Constantine Military Region Oran, Algeria in 1964. After independence he rose through the ranks, becoming head of the 2nd Military Region in 1964 and Colonel in 1969. He commanded the 2nd Military Region from 1964 to 1978, and there supervised the evacuation of French military forces stationed at Mers el-Kebir in conformity with the Évian Accords, and the monitoring of the frontier between Algeria and Morocco which was the site of significant tension.

===Ascent to presidency===

Bendjedid was minister of defense from November 1978 to February 1979 and became president following the death of Boumédiènne. Bendjedid was a compromise candidate who came to power after the party leadership and presidency was contested at the fourth FLN congress held on 27 &quot;-&quot; 31 January 1979. The most likely to succeed Boumediene were Mohammad Salah Yahiaoui and Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The latter had served as a foreign secretary at the United Nations for sixteen years. He was a prominent member of the Oujda group and regarded as a pro-Western liberal. Yahiaoui was closely affiliated with the communists, permitting the Parti de l&#x27;Avant-Garde Socialiste (PAGS) to acquire jurisdiction over the mass trade union and youth organizations.
In office, Bendjedid reduced the state&#x27;s role in the economy and eased government surveillance of citizens. In the late 1980s, with the economy failing due to rapidly falling oil prices, tension rose between elements of the regime who supported Bendjedid&#x27;s economic liberalization policies, and those who wanted a return to the statist model. In October 1988, youth marches protesting the regime&#x27;s austerity policies and shouting slogans against Bendjedid, evolved into massive rioting now known as the 1988 October Riots which spread to Oran, Annaba and other cities; the military&#x27;s brutal suppression of the rioters left several hundred dead. Perhaps as a political survival strategy, Bendjedid then called for and began to implement a transition towards multi-party democracy. However, in 1992 the military intervened to stop elections from bringing the Islamist Front Islamique du Salut (FIS) to power, forcing Bendjedid out of office and sparking a long and bloody Algerian Civil War.

==Post-presidency life==
Bendjedid was put under house arrest in Oran but freed in 1999 after the rise to the presidency of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. In a 2002 interview, he revealed his willingness to accept the results of the 1991 poll and work with the FIS while avoiding their takeover of all government institutions. He believed the constitution gave him the power to do so, but he failed to win over the support of the military establishment.

He returned to the public eye in late 2008 when he gave a controversial speech at a conference in Al-Tarif, his hometown. The publication of his memoirs was announced on 1 November 2012, coinciding with the 58th anniversary of the outbreak of the War of National Liberation.

==Illness and death==
Bendjedid was hospitalized in Paris in January 2012 for cancer treatment and returned to hospital again in May and October 2012. On 3 October 2012, Bendjedid was admitted to the intensive care unit of a military hospital in Ain-Naadja in Algiers. State-run media announced that he died of cancer on 6 October 2012. He was buried at the El Alia Cemetery.

== Honours ==
===National honours===
* Grand Master of the National Order of Merit

===Foreign honours===
* Order of the Yugoslav Great Star (1982)
* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion (1984)

<doc id="410340" wikidata="Q6138562" url="?curid=410340" title="USS Alexander Hamilton (SSBN-617)">
<text>USS &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; (SSBN-617) was a United States ballistic missile submarine. It was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, the first US Secretary of the Treasury, who was instrumental in the formation of both the United States Coast Guard and the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;″s keel was laid down on 26 June 1961 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation. She was launched on 18 August 1962 sponsored by Carolie Frances (Woods) Hollingsworth, the great-great-great granddaughter of Alexander Hamilton, and the wife of Valentine Hollingsworth, Jr., and commissioned on 27 June 1963 with Commander Norman B. Bessac commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Benjamin F. Sherman, Jr., commanding the Gold Crew.

==Operational history==
Between 28 June and 18 October 1963, &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; carried out two shakedown cruises, one for each of her crews. Following those operations, she conducted post-shakedown availability. After trials early in 1964, she departed the United States East Coast on 16 March 1964 to deploy to Rota, Spain, her base of operations. She conducted deterrent patrols out of that port for the remainder of 1964 as a unit of Submarine Squadron 16. In January 1965, she transferred to Submarine Squadron 14 and was rebased at Holy Loch, Scotland. Her cycle of patrols from there lasted until 2 June 1967, at which time she returned to the United States at Charleston, South Carolina. Later that month, she moved north to New London, Connecticut, and from there into the Electric Boat shipyard on 18 June 1967 to begin her first overhaul and nuclear refueling.

&quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; completed the overhaul on 28 June 1968 and conducted post-overhaul trials, inspections, and shakedown training until early October 1968. In November, she began a deterrent patrol en route to Rota, her new base, where she arrived on 30 December 1968. For the next four years, she operated from Rota as a unit of Submarine Squadron 16.

At the conclusion of her 31st deterrent patrol, &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; returned to Charleston in November 1972 and in January 1973 began her second refueling overhaul, combined with a conversion to carry Poseidon missiles, at the shipyard of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. The work on those two modifications lasted for over two years. Upon its completion, she carried out shakedown in April 1975 and devoted the remainder of the year to training and various post-overhaul trials. She conducted her 32nd and 33rd deterrent patrols in the early part of 1976. &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; concluded the 33rd patrol at Holy Loch in May 1976 and conducted her next three deterrent patrols from that base. While on her 35th patrol, she visited Port Canaveral, Florida, and New London, Connecticut, before concluding that patrol at Charleston in March 1977. During March and April 1977, she completed refit and conducted refresher training. In July 1977, she departed Charleston for another deterrent patrol which ended with her arrival at Holy Loch in September 1977.

From Holy Loch, &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; conducted her 39th and 40th deterrent patrols. She departed Holy Loch in May 1978 for her 41st deterrent patrol and concluded it at Charleston in July 1978. She remained there until August 1978 when she got underway for New London. She arrived at New London early in September 1978 and, after exchanging crews, embarked upon her 42nd deterrent patrol later that month. She ended that patrol at Holy Loch in October 1978. Over the next year, she made four patrols from Holy Loch. On 31 October 1979, she departed Holy Loch on her 46th deterrent patrol, ending it at Charleston on 7 December 1979. Early in January 1980, she departed Charleston on her 47th deterrent patrol. She concluded that patrol at Holy Loch on 17 March 1980 and operated from that base for the remainder of 1980.

On March 3, 1981, The USS Alexander Hamilton (SSBN 617) snagged the nets of the Aquila, a 73-foot fishing vessel from Campbeltown, Scotland, and towed it astern for two miles in the Sound of Jura. The crew had to cut $3,200 of gear and the U.S. government reimbursed the cost. This event was featured in a Navy Times February 19, 1990 article.

In May 1982, she left for patrol #56 with the Blue Crew under the command of Captain Marcus V. Friedman and Executive Officer Shaffer. In July 1982, the crew was treated to an initiation ceremony into the Realm of the Arctic Circle where first time participants were subsequently issued a &quot;Blue Nose&quot; certificate. The Hamilton returned to Holy Loch in late August 1982 and the ship was turned over to the Gold Crew. On 19 November 1982 a Change of Command Ceremony was held in Groton, CT for the USS Alexander Hamilton (SSBN 617) (Blue) between Commander Marcus V. Friedman (detaching) and Commander Corwin Guy Mendenhall III (relieving). Blue Crew patrol #58 started in December 1982 under the command of Captain Mendenhall and concluded in March 1983. This patrol included a brief stop in Plymouth, England in March 1983 where the crew was given a chance to visit the city. Patrol #60, again staffed by the Blue Crew, departed Holy Loch in June 1983 and returned the following October. In January, 1984 the Blue Crew once again departed Holy Loch for patrol #62 and returned in April 1984.

===Planned deactivation and reprieve===
&quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;″s deterrent patrols out of Holy Loch continued until 1986. At that time, she was to have been decommissioned in order to remove her from the fleet as a gesture of goodwill in accordance with the terms of the unratified SALT II strategic arms limitation treaty. Upon her arrival in Groton early in 1986, she began preparations for deactivation. The grounding of the ballistic missile submarine , however, forced the Navy to change its plans. What had been a deactivation overhaul quickly became a four-week maintenance availability for repairs to get &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; ready for active service. In April 1986, she departed for Charleston, South Carolina, for further work conducted in the floating drydock . While at Charleston, she also served at sea occasionally as a training platform.

In mid-June 1986, &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; returned to Groton. During the summer of 1986, she participated in training cruises for United States Naval Academy and Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps midshipmen.

In August 1986, &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;″s crew learned that her refueling overhaul would be conducted by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Bremerton, Washington. She departed Groton on 1 October 1986 to begin the voyage to Bremerton. Steaming by way of the Panama Canal, she arrived at Bremerton late in November 1986. She formally began her refueling overhaul on 30 November 1987.

On 28 April 1992, The USS &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; SSBN 617 conducted dive number 1000, the most recorded dives ever done by a SSBN submarine.

<text>Ahmed Ben Bella ( &quot;&quot;; 25 December 1916 – 11 April 2012) was an Algerian politician, soldier and socialist revolutionary who served as the head of government of Algeria from 27 September 1962 to 15 September 1963 and then the first president of Algeria from 15 September 1963 to 19 June 1965.

Ben Bella played an important role during the Algerian war of independence against France, leading the FLN, organizing the shipment of foreign weapons and coordinating political strategy from Cairo. Despite not being present in Algeria, French authorities tried to assassinate him multiple times. Once Algeria gained independence in 1962, Ben Bella&#x27;s Oujda Group seized power from Benyoucef Benkhedda&#x27;s provisional government after a short crisis, and Ben Bella became prime minister of Algeria with Ferhat Abbas as acting president. Ben Bella succeeded Ferhat Abbas on 15 September 1963 after rapidly sidelining him, and was elected president after winning an election with 99.6 per cent of the votes.

Ben Bella pursued Arab socialist and Pan-Arabist policies and came to describe himself as a Nasserist. He nationalized several industries and established good relations with other anti-Zionist Arab states and left-wing states such as Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s Egypt and Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba. He encountered political conflict during his presidency, and was faced with border clashes in the Sand War with Morocco in 1963 and a failed rebellion by the Socialist Forces Front against his regime in 1963–1964. He was ousted from power and put under house arrest after a coup d&#x27;état by his Minister of Defense Houari Boumédiéne in 1965. He was freed from house arrest in 1980 and died in 2012.

==Early life==
Ahmed Ben Bella was born on 25 December 1916 in the commune of Maghnia. His father was a farmer and small-time trader. He had four brothers and two sisters. His oldest brother died from wounds received in the First World War, during which he fought for France. Another brother died from illness and a third disappeared in France in 1940, during the mayhem of the Nazi victory.

Ben Bella began his studies in Maghnia, where he went to the French school, and continued them in the city of Tlemcen, where he first became aware of racial discrimination. Disturbed by the animus against Muslims expressed by his European teacher, he began chafing against imperialism and colonialism and criticized the domination of French cultural influence over Algeria. During this period, he joined the nationalist movement.

==Service with French Army==
Ben Bella first volunteered for service in the French Army in 1936. The Army was one of the few avenues of advancement for Algerians under colonial rule and voluntary enlistment was common. Posted to Marseille, he played center midfield for Olympique de Marseille in 1939–1940. His only appearance for the club was in a game against FC Antibes in the Coupe de France on 29 April 1940 in Cannes, during which he scored a goal. Club officials offered him a professional spot on the team, but he rejected the offer. He also played for IRB Maghnia.

Ben Bella enlisted again in 1940, believing that the French Army offered the best opportunity for non-discriminatory treatment of Algerians. Fighting for France during the Second World War, he was decorated twice, receiving the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; after manning an anti-aircraft post during the Nazi invasion in 1940. He was demobilised after the fall of France, but joined a Free French regiment of Moroccan &quot;tirailleurs&quot; (infantry) with whom he saw service throughout the Italian campaign. In Italy, he was decorated for bravery demonstrated at the Battle of Monte Cassino, during which he dragged a wounded commissioned officer to safety, assuming control of his battalion. For this, he was promoted to the rank of warrant officer and received the Médaille militaire, the highest decoration of the Free French forces, directly from Charles de Gaulle.

On 8 May 1945, while France was celebrating Germany&#x27;s surrender, widespread protests erupted in the Algerian town of Sétif. The war had intensified colonial repression of the Algerians, prompting a backlash that led to the deaths of more than 100 Europeans and around 1,500 Algerians, according to official reports. Anti-colonial insurgents, however, put the number of Algerian deaths at around 10,000. The fallout from the Sétif uprising shocked Ben Bella and his Algerian companions, as they realized that France would not recognize their claim to equal treatment despite their wartime service.

==Before independence==
===First organization for uprising against French regime in Algeria===
After the Sétif and Guelma massacre in 1945, Ben Bella returned to Algeria, becoming politically active in the opposition movement against the French regime. French authorities sent assailants with the intention of assassinating him on his farm.

The attempt against his life failed, but the farm was confiscated and he went into hiding. After the nationalist parties had achieved great success in local elections in 1947, by this was followed by the fixing of the Algerian Assembly elections in 1948 by French officials, agreed to and justified by the Socialist Governor-General Marcel-Edmond Naegelen, Ben Bella became convinced that achieving democratic independence through peaceful means was illusory. Together with Messali Hadj and his party, he helped to found the &quot;Organisation Spéciale&quot; (OS), a paramilitary organization whose strategic aim was to take up arms against the French colonial regime as quickly as possible. This group became the immediate predecessor of the National Liberation Front. He was in charge of organizing the wilayas (regional military sections of the FLN) and supplying weapons to insurgents and getting financial support from friendly Arab countries.

On 4 April 1949, Ben Bella led a robbery of the central post office in Oran to gain funds for the organization, obtaining 3 million francs which he used to buy weapons. He was eventually caught in 1950 and sentenced to eight years&#x27; imprisonment in Blida jail. In captivity, he was exposed to the writings of Sultan-Galiev, which greatly influenced him in the future. He escaped soon afterwards in 1952 by cutting through his prison window bars with a knife that had been smuggled into jail in a loaf of bread, making his way to Tunisia and then to Egypt, reaching Cairo by 1952 where he was granted sanctuary by the president Gamal Abdel Nasser.

At the outbreak of the Algerian War in 1954, Ben Bella was based in Cairo, where he had become one of the nine members of the Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action that headed the &quot;Front de Liberation Nationale&quot; (FLN), founded in November that year during a secret meeting of Algerian leaders in Switzerland. The FLN soon began armed insurrection against the French colonists, which became a guerilla war in Algeria.

===Algerian War===

Ben Bella played an important role during the war, leading the FLN, organizing the shipment of foreign weapons and coordinating political strategy. Although he was not present in Algeria, assassination attempts against him by French authorities persisted. After national independence, he was named vice president of Algeria in Benyoucef Benkhedda&#x27;s cabinet.

Ben Bella and his associates were responsible for developing a system of bases and routes for providing the National Liberation Army (ALN) in Algeria with weapons, ammunition and other supplies. The ALN logistical system was focused in Egypt and Libya in the early years of the war. Once the French occupation of Tunisia and Morocco ended in 1956, Ben Bella and his associates established a system of camps in both countries for training men and sending them into Algeria.

Ben Bella felt excluded from the Soummam conference on 20 August 1956, and thus rejected it for its &quot;secularism&quot;, the decision to integrate the European minority in independent Algeria, and the misrepresentation of delegates. According to Abane Ramdane, Ben Bella&#x27;s rejection of the charter was due to the fact that it was drafted by Kabyles. Ben Bella was also accused of not providing enough money and weapons for the cause.

In 1956, he refused to receive a package delivered by taxi to his hotel in Cairo. A bomb exploded inside the taxi as it drove away, killing the driver. That same year, while in his hotel in Tripoli, a pied noir gunman with links to French intelligence called Jean David entered his room and fired, wounding but not killing him. The shooter was later killed by guards while fleeing, at the Libyan border. 

In October 1956, he was arrested in Algiers by French military authorities, who hijacked the plane on which he was flying. He was kept prisoner until the Evian accords in 1962, and released on 5 July. His arrest earlier had led to the resignation of Alain Savary, who was opposed to Guy Mollet&#x27;s policies; as a prisoner during the height of the FLN terror campaign, he remained relatively untarnished by his association with the organization.

At the FLN conference in Tripoli in May–June 1962, Ben Bella repealed the Soummam conference and gave priority to the implementation of a national Arab-Islamic culture and identity of Algeria.

Like many Arab revolutionaries of the time, he came to describe himself as a &quot;Nasserist&quot; and developed close ties to Egypt even before national independence was achieved. Nasser&#x27;s material, moral and political support of the Algerian movement became a source of geopolitical trouble for Egypt, as it played a major role in France&#x27;s decision to wage war against him during the 1956 Suez Crisis.

Due to Pakistan&#x27;s support for the FLN, Ben Bella had been given a Pakistani diplomatic passport to make his foreign travels possible in the face of an international manhunt co-ordinated by the French and their allies. Ben Bella also traveled on a Pakistani diplomatic passport during the years of his exile from Algeria in the 1980s.

==Algerian independence==

===Ben Bella&#x27;s government===
After Algeria&#x27;s independence, Ben Bella quickly became a popular leader. In June 1962, he challenged the leadership of the premier, Benyoucef Benkhedda. This led to several disputes among his rivals in the FLN, which were quickly suppressed by Ben Bella&#x27;s rapidly growing number of supporters, most notably within the armed forces, whose chief was Houari Boumédiènne. Boumédiènne marched his supporter troops to Algiers and Ben Bella seized power on 4 August in a coup d&#x27;état. By September 1962, Bella was in control of Algeria in all but name. He was elected premier in a one-sided election on 20 September, which was recognized by the United States on 29 September. Algeria was admitted as the 109th member of the United Nations on 8 October 1962.

As prime minister, Ben Bella arranged to legalize the seizures of autogestion spontaneously undertaken by Algerian workers. In March 1963, he drew up (with his circle of advisers) a set of decrees to nationalize all previously European-owned land. In his words, the &quot;Tripoli program remained a dead letter, and independence and revolution made no sense, as long as Algerian soil was in hands of the big landowners&quot;.

He used his position to push for the approval of the constitution drawn up by the FLN, and alienated allies. Mohammed Khider and Ferhat Abbas resigned their political offices in 1963, dismayed by the dictatorial tendencies on display in Ben Bella&#x27;s proposed constitution, which enshrined a one-party state and rejected political pluralism. Nevertheless, this action presented no problem to the Algerian people: the constitution was approved and, on 15 September 1963, Ben Bella was elected president of the country, unopposed and with an immense majority.

During his presidency, Ben Bella was confronted with the challenge of building a postcolonial state infrastructure from the ground up; the country had no independent state traditions and its senior civil servants had always been staffed by the French. Despite a predisposition toward an egalitarian way of governing and a lifestyle lacking in extravagance (he did not live in the governor&#x27;s palace, and maintained an open-door policy with Algerian citizens), Ben Bella&#x27;s actions in government did not always match his intentions. After stabilizing the country, he embarked on a series of initially popular but chaotically handled land reforms for the benefit of landless farmers, and increasingly turned to socialist rhetoric.

His policy of autogestion, or self-management, was adopted after Algerian peasants seized former French lands and was inspired by Marxist Yugoslavian leader Josip Broz Tito. He also worked on the development of his country, instituting reforms, undertaking campaigns for national literacy, and nationalizing several industries and calling for socialization of the economy and Arabization.

On many occasions, however, he improvised government policy as he went, as with his National Solidarity Fund, for which he asked the Algerian people to &quot;voluntarily&quot; hand over jewellery and banknotes.

In international relations, he had to maintain connections with the former colonial master France, and also accepted economic aid from both the US and the Soviet Union, as each sought to move his regime into its orbit and into opposition to the other. At the same time, Ben Bella wished Algeria to become a leader of Third World liberation movements and of the Third World itself. To strengthen relations with other colonies and former colonies, Algeria joined the Non-Aligned Movement under Ben Bella&#x27;s regime, and he forged links with such African leaders as Gamal Abdel Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Keita and Sekou Toure to aid rebel movements throughout Africa.

He also established good relations with Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and Cuba. After his 1962 visit, Cuba sent a health mission to Algeria, with doctors and medical help, and later sent weapons and soldiers as aid during the Sand War against Morocco. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 30 April 1964.

During his tenure, Ben Bella encountered political struggles with former leaders of the FLN, including Mohammed Khider, Ferhat Abbas, Mohammed Boudiaf and Hocine Aït Ahmed. Ahmed founded the Front des Forces Socialistes (Socialist Forces Front) (FFS) to confront Ben Bella, and the others joined after being alienated by Ben Bella&#x27;s dictatorial leadership. In 1963, the FFS called for an armed revolt against the regime. However, it had force only in the Kabylia region, and by the summer of 1964 the revolt was controlled and FFS leaders were arrested.

In addition to political resistance, Ben Bella faced religious opposition. The Association of the Algerian Ulema claimed that the &quot;state Islam&quot; that Ben Bella wanted to achieve was not an application of true Muslim values, but rather an attempt to please the population.

His government was overthrown in June 1965 while he was planning to host an Afro-Asian international meeting, in a bloodless coup led by his defense minister Houari Boumédiène. He was held for eight months in an underground prison, then for the next 14 years lived under house arrest.

===House arrest and later freedom===
After being deposed in 1965, Ben Bella was detained for eight months in prison. He was then transferred to an isolated villa in Birouta, where he was placed under house arrest for 14 years. He was, however, permitted a private life there, and in 1971 he married Zohra Sellami, an Algerian journalist; their meeting was arranged by Ben Bella&#x27;s mother. They became religiously observant Muslims, and adopted two girls, Mehdia and Nouria. After Boumedienne&#x27;s death in 1978, restrictions on him were eased in July 1979, and he was freed on 30 October 1980. Ben Bella briefly resided in France but was then expelled in 1983. He moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, and launched the Mouvement pour la Démocratie en Algérie (MDA), a moderate Islamic opposition party, in 1984. In September 1990, he returned to Algeria, and, in 1991, led the MDA in the first round of the country&#x27;s abortive parliamentary elections. The MDA was banned in 1997.

==Later life==
In 2003, Ben Bella was elected president of the International Campaign Against Aggression on Iraq at its Cairo Conference. He described himself numerous times in interviews as an Islamist of a &quot;mild and peace-loving flavour&quot;. Despite his former establishment of a one-party state after Algeria gained its independence, he became a vocal advocate for democracy in Algeria. He described the militant tendency arising in the Islamic world as having developed from an incorrect and faulty interpretation of Islam. Despite controversies, he was respected for his role in the anti-colonial struggle and was seen by many Arab intellectuals as one of the last original Arab nationalists.

He was also the chairperson of the African Union Panel of the Wise, which is mandated to advise the AU Commission on issues relevant to conflict prevention, management and resolution. The other members of the panel at the time were President Miguel Trovoada (former president of São Tomé and Príncipe), Dr. Salim A. Salim (former Secretary-General of the OAU), Dr. Brigalia Bam (Chair of South Africa&#x27;s Electoral Commission) and Elisabeth Pognon (former President of the Constitutional Court of Benin).

==Illness, death and state funeral==
In February 2012, Ben Bella was admitted to a hospital for medical checks. At the same time, a report circulated that he had died, but this was denied by his family.

Ben Bella died on 11 April 2012 at his family home in Algiers. Though the reasons of his death were unknown, he had been treated for respiratory illnesses twice at Ain Naadja. His body lay in state on 12 April before the funeral at El Alia Cemetery on 13 April. Algeria declared eight days of national mourning.

<text>The 5 Lexington Avenue Express is a rapid transit service in the A Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored forest green since it uses the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in Manhattan.

The 5 train operates 24 hours, although service patterns vary based on the time of day. Weekday rush hour and midday service operates between Dyre Avenue in Eastchester, Bronx, and Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College in Flatbush, Brooklyn, making all stops in the Bronx and express stops in Manhattan, and in Brooklyn (between Borough Hall and Franklin Avenue); during rush hours in the peak direction, 5 trains operate express in the Bronx between East 180th Street and Third Avenue–149th Street. Limited rush hour service originates and terminates either at Nereid Avenue or Gun Hill Road/White Plains Road in the Bronx instead of Dyre Avenue, as well as either at Utica or New Lots Avenues in Brooklyn instead of Flatbush Avenue. The 5 short turns at Bowling Green in the Financial District of Manhattan during weekday evenings and weekends during the day and does not operate to or from Flatbush Avenue. Overnight, the 5 operates as a shuttle between Dyre Avenue and East 180th Street in the Bronx.

Historically, the 5 has run south to Crown Heights–Utica Avenue or New Lots Avenue. Its northern terminal was originally Wakefield–241st Street or East 180th Street. The section between Dyre Avenue and East 180th Street, which was acquired from the defunct New York, Westchester and Boston Railway and started operating as a shuttle in 1941, was connected to the rest of the subway in 1957 and became part of the 5 in 1965. Since 1983, most trains run only to Bowling Green or Flatbush Avenue, although some rush-hour trains still run to/from Utica or New Lots Avenues. Peak service on White Plains Road was cut from 241st Street to 238th Street. During many weekends from 2017 to 2019, service ran between 241st Street and Flatbush Avenue, replacing 2 service.

==Service history==

=== Early history ===
The section from East 180th Street to Dyre Avenue was once part of the mainline of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, a standard gauge electric commuter railroad built by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. Upon its closure in 1937, the entire property was put up for sale.

On December 21, 1925, the number of Manhattan-bound through trains in the morning rush hour from the White Plains Road Line was doubled with the addition of two more through trips, and service was considerably increased in the evening rush hour toward the Bronx, with through trains running every 11 minutes. In 1926, during the morning rush hour several northbound trains terminated at 86th Street.

Saturday 5 service to Crown Heights–Utica Avenue began on April 28, 1930.

As of 1934, trains normally ran from Wakefield–241st Street or East 180th Street to Atlantic Avenue. During weekday rush hours and weekend afternoons they were extended to Utica Avenue. Late-night service was not operated.

From July 24, 1938, to September 18, 1938, there was Sunday daytime 5 service to New Lots Avenue. Sunday afternoon 5 service to New Lots began on July 10, 1939.

=== 1940s through 1960s ===

==== Main service ====
On December 22, 1946, alternate Sunday morning 5 service to New Lots began. However, on March 5, 1950, 5 service was cut back to Utica Avenue all day on Sundays.

Express service on the IRT White Plains Road Line began on April 23, 1953, with alternate 5 trains using the middle track between East 180th Street and 149th Street during the weekday rush in the peak direction. Starting on October 2, 1953, the express 5 trains began running express between East 180th Street and Gun Hill Road – also using the middle track – and were branded as &quot;Thru-Express&quot; trains in order to encourage passengers who changed at Gun Hill Road for Third Avenue Elevated service to stay on subway trains. On June 7, 1954, to speed up service, thru-expresses began skipping 138th Street, allowing for one more train per hour. On June 16, 1958, these 5 trains resumed stopping at 138th Street, with 4 trains skipping the station during rush hours.

Beginning on May 3, 1957, limited rush hour 5 service ran to Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College replacing the 4 service. Evening, Saturday afternoon, and Sunday trains were cut back to South Ferry.

Beginning on March 1, 1960, evening trains began making all stops in Manhattan. Beginning on April 8, 1960, weekday evening service was discontinued, as was weekday rush service to Flatbush Avenue.

Starting on April 18, 1965, most daytime service was rerouted to Eastchester–Dyre Avenue (see ), replacing 2 daytime service to Dyre Avenue except evenings and late nights when shuttle service served Dyre Avenue. Some weekday rush peak-direction service to 241st Street was retained, while Saturday and Sunday evening trains were cut back from 241st Street to East 180th Street. Also, Saturday morning trains were cut back from Atlantic Avenue to South Ferry. Starting on May 3, 1965, trains to or from 241st Street began making all stops between Gun Hill Road and East 180th Street.

====Dyre Avenue Shuttle====
In 1940, the City of New York purchased the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, and began integrating the line into the system. Plans were made for restoring the old line north into Westchester County, but ultimately failed, and the superfluous track and overhead catenary on the old NYW&amp;B were scrapped by 1943. The section below East 180th Street to Greens Farm Junction was once used to interchange with the New Haven (and later Penn Central and Conrail) to bring subway cars and other equipment on and off the system. That section was removed in the 1970s, isolating this part of the subway from the interchange.

On May 15, 1941, the East 180th Street–Dyre Avenue Shuttle or Dyre Avenue Shuttle was established as a new subway service and full-time shuttle between the former East 180th Street station of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway and Eastchester–Dyre Avenue, the northernmost station on the NYW&amp;B within New York City. There was a paper transfer to the IRT White Plains Road Line at East 180th Street, since there were no track connections between the lines. The shuttle was run with trains consisting of two cars, and there was no late night service when the line opened in 1941. The fares were collected in the stations during rush hours, and by conductors on the trains when ridership was light.

In 1957, a flyover connection opened between the East 180th Street station of the White Plains Road Line and the Dyre Avenue Line, enabling through service by trains from the 2 route from Manhattan to Dyre Avenue. At the same time, the former NYW&amp;B station was closed and the off-hours Dyre Avenue Shuttle rerouted to the White Plains Road Line station. These shuttles were initially labeled 2 like the full-time service but were later signed as . Effective April 18, 1965, the Dyre Avenue Line was instead served by 5 trains at all times. The line is still operated as a shuttle late nights, labeled as part of the 5 route.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
Beginning on May 23, 1976, 5 service began starting late on Sunday mornings. As of May 24, 1976, weekday midday 5 service from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. was cut back to Bowling Green from Atlantic Avenue.

On October 26, 1978, the NYCTA presented a plan to Bronx Community Board 12 to have all rush hour peak-direction thru-expresses from the White Plains Road Line run express between Gun Hill Road and East 180th Street, and to have all trains from Dyre Avenue run express in the Bronx. The changes were expected to be implemented in 12 to 19 months.

In 1979, with the color coding of subway routes based on their trunk line in Manhattan, the 5 service&#x27;s color was changed to forest green, as it goes via the Lexington Avenue Line in Manhattan. On January 13, 1980, all 5 service to/from Dyre Avenue and Wakefield–241st Street during rush hours in the peak direction began running express in the Bronx. 5 service was re-extended to Atlantic Avenue on May 15, 1980.

On July 10, 1983, rush hour 5 trains were rerouted from Utica Avenue to Flatbush Avenue with limited service to/from Utica Avenue or New Lots Avenue. Beginning on January 18, 1988, all midday 5 service was cut back to Bowling Green, to allow 4 service to operate to Utica.

=== 1990s ===
In Spring 1995, rush hour service to 241st Street was cut back to Nereid Avenue. 241st Street had insufficient capacity to terminate all 2 and 5 trains during rush hours, requiring some 2 and 5 trips to terminate at Nereid Avenue. To ease passenger confusion regarding which trips terminate where and to provide more reliable service, it was decided to have all 2 trips terminate at 241st Street and have all 5 trains terminate at 238th Street. In addition, the span of 5 peak period Bronx express service to Dyre Avenue was expanded by 45 minutes in each rush hour. These two recommendations were made in response to comments made as part of the Northeast Bronx Comprehensive Study. New York City Transit decided against operating all 5 trains via the Dyre Avenue Line because it would reduce the attractiveness of the White Plains Road Line as it would force passengers using the Lexington Avenue Line to transfer. However, this would have simplified operations.

On December 9, 1999, New York City Transit released a proposal revising 2 and 5 service in the Bronx to eliminate a merge north of the East 180th Street station, increasing capacity and reducing delays, to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Board. Dyre Avenue-bound 5 trains would start running local along the White Plains Road Line, while 2 trains would run express. Nereid Avenue-bound 5 trains would continue to run express in the Bronx. As part of the change, the frequency of service at White Plains Road Line local station would decrease from 12 trains per hour to 7 trains per hour. Market research showed that riders at these stations preferred Lexington Avenue Line service. In addition, riders on the line north of East 180th Street would gain express service. This change would have been revenue neutral.

Shortly after the proposal was more widely announced in April 2000, Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein collected 2,000 signatures for a petition opposing the change. The MTA delayed the change&#x27;s planned implementation by a month after receiving the petition. Opponents of the change argued that the loss of express service would’ve made commute times on the Dyre Avenue line longer with an increase by up to 15 minutes also argued that it would have increased subway crowding on the 2 train, especially at the 72nd Street station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. The change was also opposed by State Senator Eric Schneiderman, Assemblyman Scott Stringer, and Public Advocate Mark Green. New York City Transit expected the passenger volume of downtown 2 trains in the morning rush hour to increase from 92% of capacity to 108% at 72nd Street. After Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver put pressure on the MTA, the change was pushed back for an additional three months in May 2000. On September 24, 2000, a spokesperson for New York City Transit said that MTA Chairman E. Virgil Conway told planners to drop the change until service on the 5 was increased with the arrival of new R142 subway cars by early 2002; the swap proposal was canceled the next day.

On May 28, 2000, the headway of Dyre Avenue shuttles between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. was decreased from 40 minutes to 20 minutes.

=== Recent history ===
On May 27, 2005, use of the 5 diamond to indicate peak direction service to Nereid Avenue was discontinued.

On June 29, 2009, 5 trains were extended from Bowling Green to Flatbush Avenue during midday hours, from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., following a successful pilot run in fall 2008.

From March 29 to September 3, 2010, rush hour peak direction 5 express service was suspended due to rehabilitation of East 180th Street and signal replacements along the IRT White Plains Road Line. PM northbound express service was suspended again on March 28, 2011, to allow for the second phase of the signal replacement project. This time, service was restored on August 8.

Due to repairs to Hurricane Sandy-related damage in the Clark Street Tunnel, which carries the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line into Brooklyn, the 5 was extended to Flatbush Avenue on weekends between June 17, 2017, and June 23, 2018, running local in Brooklyn. In the Bronx, the 5 ran to 241st Street instead of Dyre Avenue in place of the 2.

On November 17, 2019, New York City Transit made adjustments to weekday evening 3, 4, and 5 service in order to accommodate planned subway work. 5 service between Dyre Avenue and Bowling Green was reduced by one hour, from 11 p.m. to 10 p.m., with Dyre Avenue Shuttle service beginning an hour earlier. This change, which was approved by the MTA Board on June 27, 2019, was expected to save the agency $900,000 annually. In addition, on this date, morning rush hour reverse-peak 5 trains that terminated at 241st Street began terminating at Gun Hill Road/White Plains Road, making express stops north of East 180th Street.

<doc id="410348" wikidata="Q32494" url="?curid=410348" title="FC Schalke 04">
<text>Fußballclub Gelsenkirchen-Schalke 04 e. V., commonly known as Schalke 04 (), and abbreviated as S04 (), is a professional sports club from the Schalke district of Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia. It is best known for its football team, which plays in the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier of the German football league system, following relegation from the Bundesliga in 2022–23. Other activities offered by the club include athletics, basketball, handball, table tennis, winter sports and eSports.

The &quot;04&quot; in the club&#x27;s name derives from its formation in 1904. Schalke have been one of the most popular professional football teams in Germany, even though the club&#x27;s heyday was in the 1930s and 1940s. As of 2023, the club has 178,000 members, making it the second-largest football club in Germany and the fourth-largest club in the world in terms of membership. 

Schalke have won seven German championships, five DFB-Pokals, one DFB Ligapokal, one DFL-Supercup, one UEFA Cup and two UEFA Intertoto Cups. In 1937, Schalke became the first German club to win the double. Since 2001, Schalke&#x27;s stadium has been the Veltins-Arena. Schalke hold a long-standing rivalry with Ruhr neighbors Borussia Dortmund, known as the Revierderby.

==History==
===1904–1927: Schalke&#x27;s early years===

The club was founded on 4 May 1904 as Westfalia Schalke by a group of high school students and first wore the colours red and yellow. The team was unable to gain admittance to the &quot;Westdeutscher Spielverband (Western German Football Association)&quot; and played in one of the &quot;wild associations&quot; of early German football. In 1912, after years of failed attempts to join the official league, they merged with the gymnastic club Schalker Turnverein 1877 in order to facilitate their entry. This arrangement held up until 1915, when SV Westfalia Schalke was re-established as an independent club. The separation proved short-lived and the two came together again in 1919 as Turn- und Sportverein Schalke 1877. The new club won its first honours in 1923 as champions of the &quot;Schalke Kreisliga&quot;. It was around this time that Schalke picked up the nickname &quot;Die Knappen&quot;, from an old German word for &quot;miners&quot; because the team drew so many of its players and supporters from the coal miners of Gelsenkirchen.

In 1924, the football team parted ways with the gymnasts again, this time taking the club chairman along with them. They took the name FC Schalke 04 and adopted the now familiar blue and white kit from which their second nickname would derive, &quot;Die Königsblauen&quot; (). The following year, the club became the dominant local side, based on a style of play that used short, sharp, man-to-man passing to move the ball. This system would later become famous as the &quot;Schalker Kreisel&quot; (). In 1927, it carried them into the top-flight &quot;Gauliga Ruhr&quot;, onto the league championship, and then into the opening rounds of the national finals. 

===1928–1933: Rise to dominance===
Following the club&#x27;s initial success, it quickly gained in popularity, especially among the working class. In 1928, the club built a new stadium, the Glückauf-Kampfbahn, and acknowledged the city&#x27;s support by renaming themselves FC Gelsenkirchen-Schalke 04. They won their first West German championship in 1929, but the following year were sanctioned for exceeding salary levels set by the league and, in an era that considered professionalism in sport to be anathema, found themselves banned from play for nearly half a year.

However, the ban had little impact on the team&#x27;s popularity: in their first match after the ban against Fortuna Düsseldorf, in June 1931, the team drew 70,000 spectators to its home ground. The club&#x27;s fortunes begun to rise from 1931 and they made a semi-final appearance in the 1932 German championship, losing 1–2 to Eintracht Frankfurt. The year after, the club reached the final, where Fortuna Düsseldorf proved the better side, winning 3–0.

===1933–1945: The championship years===
With the re-organisation of German football in 1933 under Nazi Germany, Schalke were placed in the Gauliga Westfalen, 1 of 16 top-flight divisions established to replace the innumerable regional and local leagues, all claiming top status. This league saw Schalke&#x27;s most successful decade in their history: from 1933 to 1942, the club would appear in 14 of 18 national finals (ten in the German championship and eight in the Tschammerpokal, the predecessor of today&#x27;s DFB-Pokal) and win their league in every one of its eleven seasons.

The club never lost a home match in the Gauliga Westfalen in all these 11 seasons and only lost six away matches, while remaining unbeaten in the 1935–36, 1936–37, 1937–38, 1938–39, 1940–41 and 1942–43 seasons, a sign of the club&#x27;s dominance.
Schalke&#x27;s first national title came in 1934 with a 2–1 victory over favourites 1. FC Nürnberg. The next year, they successfully defended their title against VfB Stuttgart with a 6–4 win. The club missed the 1936 final, but would make appearances in the championship match in each of the next six years, coming away victorious in 1937, 1939, 1940 and 1942. Three of those national finals were against Austrian teams – Admira Wien, Rapid Wien and First Vienna – which played in Germany&#x27;s Gauliga Ostmark after Austria&#x27;s incorporation into the Reich through the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot;.

&quot;Die Königsblauen&quot; also made frequent appearances in the final of the Tschammerpokal, but had less success there. They lost the inaugural Tschammerpokal 0–2 to 1. FC Nürnberg in 1935. They also made failed appearances in the 1936, 1941, and 1942 finals with their only victory coming in 1937 against Fortuna Düsseldorf.

Over a dozen seasons, from 1933 to 1945, Schalke won 162 of 189 Gauliga matches, drawing 21 and losing only 6. Within this period, they scored 924 goals and conceded just 145. From 1935 to 1939, they did not lose a single league match. The club&#x27;s dominance throughout this period led them to be held up for propaganda purposes by the Nazi regime as an example of &quot;new Germany&quot;.

===1945–1959: Football after World War II===

With Germany in chaos towards the end of World War II, Schalke played just two matches in 1945. They resumed regular play following the war and, for a few years, continued to compete as a strong side. They set a record in a national championship round match with a 20–0 win against SpVgg Herten, but that spoke more to the weakened condition of German football than to the ability of the team. Schalke&#x27;s play fell off, and they only finished sixth in the new Oberliga West in 1947. Within two years, they slipped to 12th place.

It would take Schalke until the mid-1950s to recover their form. They finished third in a tight three-way race for the 1954 Oberliga West title, decided on the last day of the season. The following year, they appeared in the DFB-Pokal final, where they lost 2–3 to Karlsruher SC. The club&#x27;s next, and to date last, German championship came in 1958 with a 3–0 victory over Hamburger SV. The strong fanbase of the club is as well documented in a local church, St. Joseph, in Gelsenkirchen. It was renovated shortly after the 1958 victory, where one of the glass windows shows Aloysius Gonzaga with a football and the dress and colours of Schalke.

===1960–2000: Entry to the Bundesliga and the &quot;Euro Fighters&quot;===
Schalke continued to play well, having several top four finishes in the years leading up to the 1963 formation of the Bundesliga, West Germany&#x27;s new federal, professional league. Those results earned them selection as 1 of 16 clubs admitted to the top-flight league.

Their first years in the Bundesliga were difficult. In 1964–65, they escaped relegation only through the expansion of the league to 18 teams. A number of finishes at the lower end of the league table followed, before a marked improvement in 1971–72, culminating in a second-place finish to Bayern Munich and after having led the league for much of the season. In the same season, Schalke won the DFB-Pokal for the second time in its history.

Despite their improved results, the seeds of a major reversal had already been sown. A number of the team&#x27;s players and officials were accused of accepting bribes as part of the widespread Bundesliga scandal of 1971. Investigation showed that Schalke had deliberately played to lose their 17 May, 28th-round match against Arminia Bielefeld, 0–1. As a result, several Schalke players were banned for life, including three – Klaus Fischer, &quot;Stan&quot; Libuda and Klaus Fichtel – who regularly played for the West Germany national team at the time.

Even though the penalties were later commuted to bans ranging from six months to two years, the scandal had a profound effect on what might have possibly become one of the dominant German teams of the 1970s. In 1973, the club moved to the Parkstadion, newly built for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and having a capacity of 70,000 spectators. In the wake of the scandal, the club&#x27;s performance was uneven. They managed another second-place result in 1976–77, finishing just one point behind champions Borussia Mönchengladbach.

In the early 1980s, &quot;Die Knappen&quot; ran into trouble and were relegated to the second division of the Bundesliga for the 1981–82 season and, after promotion, again in 1983–84. They returned to the top flight in 1984 but were relegated once more to the second tier in 1988. They returned to the Bundesliga in the 1991–92 season and stayed in the top flight until 2021.

The club earned their first honours since the DFB-Pokal win of 1972 with a victory in the final of the 1996–97 UEFA Cup over Inter Milan on penalties. Coached by the Dutch coach Huub Stevens, the 1997 Schalke squad earned the nickname &quot;Euro Fighters&quot;, which is still in use among fans. Stevens, who was widely unknown in Germany at the time, quickly earned himself a cult following among the Schalke supporters.

Stevens successfully implemented a system of rigid discipline, especially in the defence. His motto &quot;Die Null muß stehen&quot; (in English, &quot;It has to read nil&quot;), which emphasized his importance on his side not conceding any goals, has found its way into everyday language in Germany.

===2000–2019: Top-table mainstay, European semi-final===

During the 1990s and early 2000, the club underwent a transformation into a modern, commercial sports organization and established itself as one of the dominant teams of the Bundesliga. Schalke won consecutive DFB-Pokals in 2000–01 and 2001–02, and earned second-place finishes in the Bundesliga in 2000–01, 2004–05 and 2006–07. The 2000–01 season finish was heartbreaking for Schalke&#x27;s supporters as it took a goal in the fourth minute of injury time by Bayern Munich away to Hamburger SV to snatch the title from &quot;Die Königsblauen&quot;.

Schalke finished in second place in 2005, a result that led to Schalke making its second appearance in the UEFA Champions League. There, Schalke finished in third place during the group stage and continuing into the UEFA Cup, where they were eliminated by the eventual winners Sevilla in the semi-finals. In 2005–06, Schalke finished in fourth place in the Bundesliga and a year later they again finished as runners-up for the third time in seven seasons.

In the 2007–08 season, Schalke progressed past the Champions League group stage for the first time and advanced to the quarter-finals after defeating Porto on penalties in the round of 16. They were eliminated by Barcelona in the quarter-finals, losing both home and away matches 0–1.

On 9 October 2006, Russian oil company Gazprom became the club&#x27;s new sponsor. The company stated it expected to invest as much as €125 million in the club over a five-and-a-half-year period. Gazprom&#x27;s sponsorship has been seen by some analysts as a politically motivated attempt to buy friendship in Germany. Within this sponsorship, Schalke 04 and Zenit Saint Petersburg signed a &quot;partnership agreement&quot;; both clubs intended to work closely on improving football-related issues.

On 13 April 2008, the club announced the dismissal of manager Mirko Slomka after a heavy defeat at the hands of Werder Bremen and elimination from the Champions League. Former players Mike Büskens and Youri Mulder were put in charge of the first team on an interim basis. For the 2008–09 Bundesliga season, Schalke signed a new head coach, Fred Rutten, previously of Twente. Rutten signed a contract running until June 2010. In March 2009, Rutten was sacked, and, once more, Mike Büskens, Youri Mulder and Oliver Reck took over the helm.
On 1 July 2009, Felix Magath, who had led VfL Wolfsburg to the top of the table in the Bundesliga, became head coach and general manager of the &quot;Königsblauen&quot;. The appointment of Magath as manager coincided with a multimillion-euro spending spree, allowing Schalke to acquire internationally known forwards Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Raúl. Magath&#x27;s tenure at the club was initially successful, seeing the side score a lot of goals in the first few months of the season, though defensive frailties and Magath&#x27;s questionable squad selection had made him unpopular with Schalke supporters by December 2010.

On 16 March 2011, Magath was sacked, and replaced with Ralf Rangnick, who previously, between 2004 and 2005, had a brief spell being in charge of the team. Within just weeks of his appointment, Rangnick masterminded a 5–2 victory over Inter Milan at the San Siro during the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Schalke advanced to the semi-final where they lost 2–0 to Manchester United in the first leg and 4–1 in the second leg. However, Schalke 04 managed to win the 2010–11 DFB-Pokal after thrashing MSV Duisburg 5–0. On 1 June 2011, Schalke&#x27;s captain, Manuel Neuer, made his move to Bayern Munich.

On 22 September 2011, Ralf Rangnick announced his immediate resignation as head coach of Schalke 04 due to long-term exhaustion. Assistant coach Seppo Eichkorn coached the team as interim manager until the appointment of Huub Stevens on 27 September 2011. Stevens&#x27; contract was to run until 30 June 2013.
Despite having legendary status among Schalke supporters, Stevens&#x27;s return to Schalke was met with some scepticism, as fans feared that Stevens, who coached Schalke to the 1997 UEFA Cup win with a rigidly defensive system, could abandon Rangnick&#x27;s system of attacking play in favour of returning to his 1997 defensive antics. The doubts of the supporters proved unfounded. Although Schalke played a somewhat inconsistent season, they reached third place in the Bundesliga and therefore direct qualification for the UEFA Champions League.

Schalke had an excellent start to the 2012–13 Bundesliga season, and worked their way to second place in the league by November, just behind Bayern Munich. On 20 October, Schalke traveled to Borussia Dortmund for matchday 8, and defeated the home side 2–1 to secure their first league &quot;Revierderby&quot; win since February 2010 while securing a Champions League place by finishing in fourth place. In the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, Schalke&#x27;s opponents were FCSB, FC Basel and Chelsea. Schalke ultimately finished the group stage in second place, behind Chelsea, and was eliminated in the round of 16 by Real Madrid CF.

The most prominent Schalke addition was the arrival of Kevin-Prince Boateng from Milan. After a disappointing first round of the 2013–14 Bundesliga that saw Schalke in seventh place in the Bundesliga table, as well as an early exit from the 2013–14 DFB-Pokal in the first knockout round, the club played their most successful second half of the season in club history. The season was marked by numerous injuries to key squad players, including Jefferson Farfán and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, for almost the entire season. It also led to performance related discussions about head coach Jens Keller. Partially, Schalke fielded up to ten young players with potential who played in the Schalke youth system throughout the season. Among the most promising young player discoveries of the 2013–14 season were Max Meyer and Leon Goretzka. The young Schalke squad won 11 out of 17 matches, totaling 36 points. At the end of the 2013–14 season, the club finished in third place in the Bundesliga table to qualify for their third-straight UEFA Champions League appearance, a feat Schalke had never before achieved.

On 7 October 2014, after a 1–2 defeat to 1899 Hoffenheim and after amassing just eight points from seven matches, Keller was sacked and succeeded by Roberto Di Matteo.
In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League, Schalke 04 finished second in a group with Chelsea, Sporting CP and Maribor. Later on, they played against the reigning champion Real Madrid again in the round of 16, where they lost the first leg at home 0–2, but they won 4–3 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. After finishing sixth in the 2014–15 season, the club announced the resignation of head coach Roberto Di Matteo on 26 May 2015. Schalke 04 then played in the Europa League, in the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons, and were eliminated by Shakhtar Donetsk and Ajax respectively.

Starting with the 2017–18 season, Domenico Tedesco took over the managerial spot for Schalke 04. At the end of the season, he led the team to finish as runners-up to Bayern Munich. On 29 July 2018, the team&#x27;s captain, Benedikt Höwedes, decided to leave after more than ten years at the club.

===2019–2020: Financial crisis===
In the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, Schalke 04 lost 2–10 on aggregate to Manchester City in the round of 16. Two days later, on 14 March 2019, Tedesco was sacked. Huub Stevens and Mike Büskens took over as caretaker managers. On 9 May 2019, David Wagner was appointed as head coach of Schalke 04 on a three-year contract until 30 June 2022.

Schalke was hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in April 2020 the club said that it was threatened by bankruptcy. Against the backdrop of a worsened financial situation caused by a high level of debt and a decrease in revenue related to restrictions put in place to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the club decided to introduce a player salary cap of €2.5 million per year.

In the second half of the 2019–20 season, Schalke set a new club record of 16 league games without a win between 25 January and 27 June 2020. Despite this losing streak, Wagner remained as manager, with Clemens Tönnies stepping down from his role as the chairman of Schalke&#x27;s supervisory board after 19 years in service instead.

===2020–present: Relegations and growing financial troubles===
Schalke started with significant difficulties into the 2020–21 season. After 8–0 and 4–0 losses away at the hands of Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig and a 1–3 loss at home against Werder Bremen, Schalke was last in the league table after three games, with one goal scored and fifteen conceded. After only two match days, Schalke dismissed David Wagner as head coach on 27 September in the aftermath of the loss against Bremen. At 1.08 average points per game, Wagner was then the lowest-scoring head coach in Schalke&#x27;s recent history.

Three days later, Manuel Baum was nominated as Wagner&#x27;s successor, with Naldo, a former Schalke player, as assistant coach. Baum, who had taken over from Wagner at a winless streak of 18 games, was unable to win a single Bundesliga game between the 3rd and 12th match days, and was dismissed ahead of the 13th match day against Arminia Bielefeld. Huub Stevens once again returned as head coach, beginning his fourth tenure. Baum&#x27;s tenure had brought the winless streak up from 18 to 28 Bundesliga games, bringing Schalke to the brink of breaking the all-time record of 31 winless games, set by SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin in the 1965–66 season. Stevens did not change Schalke&#x27;s fortunes in his first game, losing the home game against Arminia Bielefeld, themselves in 16th place and thus threatened by relegation, with a 0–1 scoreline.

On 27 December 2020, Schalke 04 announced that they signed a contract with Swiss manager Christian Gross to be the head coach of the club until the end of the season, making him the fourth head coach for Schalke 04 during the 2020–21 season. Under Gross, Schalke&#x27;s negative streak continued with a 3–0 loss to Hertha BSC, marking the 30th consecutive winless game, a losing streak of 358 days. On 9 January 2021 Schalke finally recorded a victory over 1899 Hoffenheim, which meant they avoided matching Tasmania Berlin&#x27;s record. It remained Schalke&#x27;s only victory under Gross, who was sacked as head coach after just eleven matches on 28 February 2021, following losses against rival Borussia Dortmund (0–4) and VFB Stuttgart (1–5). Alongside Gross, sporting director Jochen Schneider, team coordinator Sascha Riether, assistant coach Rainer Widmayer and fitness coach Werner Leuthard were also relieved of their duties. At 0.45 average points per game, Gross was the least successful head coach at Schalke since Karl-Heinz Marotzke in 1967.

On 2 March 2021, Dimitrios Grammozis was announced as new head coach for Schalke 04. Grammozis started with a scoreless draw against Mainz 05, but his team was unable to collect any points in the two following matches, which were lost 5–0 against VfL Wolfsburg and 3–0 against Borussia Mönchengladbach. Schalke did not score a goal in the first three matches under Grammozis, a joined negative record for the club (Helmut Schulte in 1992–93 and Markus Weinzierl in 2016–17 also waited for the first goal until their fourth match as head coach for Schalke). Against Borussia Mönchengladbach, Schalke conceded its fifth own goal of the season, yet another negative record.

Relegation to the 2. Bundesliga was confirmed on 20 April 2021, as Schalke 04 lost 1–0 to Arminia Bielefeld, which led to riots by Schalke supporters.
On 28 February 2022, following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Schalke cancelled their contract with main sponsor Gazprom, further straining the club&#x27;s financial situation. Grammozis was sacked as head coach on 6 March 2022, as promotion back to the Bundesliga appeared uncertain. He was replaced by Mike Büskens as caretaker manager until the end of the season. Schalke recovered under Büskens, winning eight of the remaining nine matches. The club secured promotion on 7 May 2022, following a 3–2 victory over FC St. Pauli that guaranteed a top-two finish in the 2. Bundesliga. Fans invaded the pitch in celebration. One week later Schalke won the 2. Bundesliga in dramatic fashion after a 88th-minute winner by Simon Terodde defeating 1. FC Nürnberg 2–1.

At the end of the 2021–22 season, Büskens moved back to the position of assistant coach. On 7 June 2022, Schalke appointed Frank Kramer as head coach. As a result of the club&#x27;s financial problems, most of the players who were essential for the success in the previous season, like Ko Itakura, could not be kept, and Schalke struggled to be competitive at the beginning of the 2022–23 season. Following a series of losses, including a 1–5 against Hoffenheim, Kramer was relieved of his duties on 19 October 2022. At the time, Schalke was 17th in the Bundesliga after ten matchdays. Matthias Kreutzer took over as caretaker manager. A week after Kramer&#x27;s dismissal, on 26 October 2022, sporting director Rouven Schröder also announced his instant resignation.

On 27 October 2022, Thomas Reis was named as Schalke&#x27;s new head coach. The first match under Reis, against SC Freiburg, was lost 0–2, marking Schalke&#x27;s seventh consecutive loss. After the game, commentators like Huub Stevens praised the team for its better organization, compared to previous matches. Schalke finished the first half of the 2022–23 Bundesliga season in 18th and last position in the table, with just nine points to their name. Following a 1–6 loss against RB Leipzig on match day 17, the club noticeably improved, especially in the defense. Between match days 18 and 21, Schalke played 0–0 four times in a row, a new Bundesliga record. The following two matches were won, and on 4 March 2023, Schalke left the last place in the table for the first time since October 2022.

On 19 February 2023, four people were seriously injured when a group of about 100 people, assumed to be supporters of Schalke&#x27;s rivals Rot-Weiss Essen and Borussia Dortmund, attacked a group of Schalke supporters with baseball bats and screwdrivers. The incident sparked fears over the upcoming derby against Dortmund. This came less than three weeks after the police had uncovered a possible plot by radical Dortmund supporters, who had tried to hide razor blades behind stickers in the stadium ahead of Dortmund&#x27;s match against Mainz. In 2014, the police had warned of a similar danger ahead of the derby, after razor blades were found in the stadium hidden behind anti-Schalke stickers. On 11 March 2023, in the 100th derby between the two clubs, Schalke played 2–2 against Borussia Dortmund, who were in second place at the time. This ended Dortmund&#x27;s streak of eight wins in a row. The police called the match &quot;extremely peaceful&quot;, which they attributed to the successful police operation. Media reports noted that several people had been injured by illegal pyrotechnics, with one woman suffering an eye injury. At least one man was taken to the hospital after an intoxicated supporter of the opposing team had bitten off his earlobe. On the final match-day of the 2022–23 season, Schalke lost 4–2 against RB Leipzig. They finished 17th in the league table, and were relegated again to the 2. Bundesliga.

After four defeats in the first seven games of the 2023–24 2. Bundesliga season, head coach Thomas Reis was sacked on 27 September 2023. On 8 October 2023, Karel Geraerts was appointed as his successor, with a contract until June 2025. Schalke finished the first half of the season in 14th position, three points ahead of the relegation spots.

On 3 January 2024, Schalke appointed Marc Wilmots as sporting director, after sacking Peter Knäbel. For Wilmots, who was one of the most prominent former Schalke players, it was his first job as a director. On 31 January, Sky reported that Schalke&#x27;s financial situation may result in the end of the club in its current form by the end of the season. If relegated from the 2. Bundesliga, Schalke would not get a license for the 3. Liga, and would have to play in the Regionalliga West, the fourth division of German football. In that scenario, the current squad and staff would have to leave the club on a free transfer. The club formally requested a license for the 3. Liga on 15 March 2024.

The second half of the 2023–24 season started with a series of defeats. The difficult sportive situation was exacerbated by growing unrest within the club, attributed to the relationship between Wilmots, Geraerts, and the team. After losing 3–0 against Magdeburg, Wilmots openly criticized both the squad and head coach Geraerts. On match-day 24, Schalke achieved a 3–1 surprise victory against league leader St. Pauli, which was St. Pauli&#x27;s first defeat of the season. Schalke followed up with a strong 3–3 against SC Paderborn. This, together with good individual performances from Yusuf Kabadayı and Ron Schallenberg, sparked new hope that the club would be able to avoid relegation. The following week, after a 5–2 loss against Hertha BSC, Geraerts was criticized heavily again for his lineup, and his lack of tactical direction, while Wilmots reaffirmed that Geraerts&#x27;s position as head coach was not in question.

==Sponsors and finances==


As of 2022, the headline sponsor of Schalke 04 is the China-based electronics manufacturer Hisense. The Russia-based hydrocarbon giant Gazprom was dropped in February 2022 as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Additional sponsors include Düsseldorf-based insurance group ERGO Insurance Group; Munich-based automotive manufacturer BMW; and its motorcycle division BMW Motorrad; Spanish-based security insurance company Reale Seguros; China-based telecommunications company Huawei; cyber gambling and sports betting company bet-at-home.com; beverage giant Coca-Cola; North Rhine Westphalia-based brewery Veltins; and the current manufacturer of Schalke&#x27;s squad kits, Germany-based Adidas.

In terms of operating income, Schalke possessed an operating income of €13 million as of 2014, and 12 per cent debt as of May 2019. As of 2019, Schalke generated the 14th-highest revenue of any football club in the world at €291 million.

In May 2019, Schalke 04 were still ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as the 14th-richest football club in the world, at €683 million, a decrease of 3 per cent from the previous year. As of 2022, the club is no longer listed among the top 20 for either revenue or value.

Schalke 04 were among the Bundesliga teams that were hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in April 2020 the club said it was threatened by bankruptcy.

October 2024 saw Schalke undertake a two-year sponsorship deal with Rootz Ltd. brand Wildz.

In January 2024, Sky reported that Schalke&#x27;s financial situation may result in the end of the club in its current form by the end of the season: If relegated from the 2. Bundesliga, Schalke would not get a license for the 3. Liga, and would have to play in the Regionalliga West, the fourth division of German football. The current squad and staff would have to leave the club on a free transfer.

==Stadium==
Schalke&#x27;s stadium, known as the Veltins-Arena under a sponsorship agreement with Veltins brewery, was built in the summer of 2001 and has a capacity of 62,271 spectators. Schalke regularly draws sell-out crowds to what is widely regarded as one of the most modern and best multi-use facilities in Europe. The facility was previously known as the Arena AufSchalke and replaced the Parkstadion (capacity of 62,000) built in 1973. Prior to this, the club played its matches in the Glückauf-Kampfbahn, constructed in 1928 with a capacity of 35,000. The Glückauf-Kampfbahn was used for amateur matches during its later years with a reduced capacity of 11,000. It is still used by the club for ceremonial purposes, like for the introduction of new players and head coaches.
==Fan culture==
The number of members of Schalke 04 grew from 10,000 in 1991 to 160,000 in 2022. This figure makes Schalke 04 the second-biggest sports club in Germany and fourth-biggest sports club in the world, behind Bayern Munich, Benfica, and CA Boca Juniors. As of 2022, Schalke is ranked as the 94th-best football club in Europe and in Continental Europe by UEFA&#x27;s UEFA club rankings. A representation of the Schalke 04 membership structure in 2014 showed, among other things, a female share of 20 per cent and a share of the age group up to ten years of 14 per cent. Around 30 per cent of the members were not from North Rhine-Westphalia. Apart from Gelsenkirchen (10,197 members) and its immediate neighbouring towns, the members of Schalke 04 also come from more distant cities such as Cologne (1,117) and Berlin (932). This high growth in Schalke 04 membership is also promoted by promotions of Schalke 04, as from 2013 to further &quot;advertise Schalke 04 brand&quot;.

On 21 August 2013, Schalke 04 played their first home match of the 2013–14 season, a UEFA Champions League qualifier at the Veltins-Arena against the Greek runners-up PAOK (led by former head coach Huub Stevens), drawing 1–1. The match and result was more than overshadowed by a controversial police operation in the &quot;S04 Ultras Gelsenkirchen&quot; block of the Veltins-Arena against the fans of the home team with nearly 80 of the home team&#x27;s fans injured. The return match was won 3–2 by Schalke without any of their supporters allowed to attend the match.

===Fan Club Association===
Schalke 04 Fan Club Association (SFCV) is an umbrella organization which, according to their own statement, has an estimated 1,500 fan clubs. Of those listed by the SFCV, 860 Schalke 04 fan clubs in October 2012 were divided geographically as follows: an estimated 200 were in Ruhr, 360 in the rest of North Rhine-Westphalia and 300 in the other federal states. A member of the board of SFCV has a permanent seat on the board of FC Schalke 04 and in 2013 SFCV merged with the &quot;Ultras Gelsenkirchen&quot; and later the supporters&#x27; club, Schalke Fan-Initiative eV with several members of strong fan groups from the SFCV, as is clear from the merger of the SFCV with the fan section of S04 has not adequately represented the fan interests.

===Friendships===

The fan-base of Schalke is connected, in a friendly way, with the supporters of 1. FC Nürnberg, Dutch club Twente, Vardar Skopie from North Macedonia, Spanish Club Sevilla F.C., Scottish club Heart of Midlothian and Polish club Górnik Zabrze. The friendship with Nürnberg is the oldest connection between two fan-bases in Germany. Before a match between both clubs, the official club songs are played.

===Club songs===
*&quot;Blau und weiß, wie lieb ich Dich&quot; (&quot;Blue and White, How I Love You&quot;) is the official club song.
*&quot;Das Steigerlied&quot;, traditional German mining song, played before every match.
*&quot;Blau und Weiß ein Leben lang&quot; (&quot;Blue and white a life-long&quot;) is the goal tune.
*&quot;Königsblauer S04&quot; (&quot;Royal Blue S04&quot;) played after every match

Popular unofficial chants are
*&quot;Der Mythos vom Schalker Markt&quot; (&quot;The Myth of the Schalke Market&quot;),
*&quot;Opa Pritschikowski&quot; (&quot;Grandpa Pritschikowski&quot;),
*&quot;Von der Emscher bis zum Bosporus&quot; (&quot;From the Emscher to the Bosphorus&quot;),
*&quot;Wir schlugen Roda...&quot; (&quot;We beat Roda...&quot;),
*&quot;Die Eurofighter sind wieder da&quot; (&quot;The Eurofighter are back again&quot;),
*&quot;Für deine Farben leben und sterben wir&quot; (&quot;For your colours we live and die&quot;),
*&quot;Wir lieben alle nur den FC Schalke&quot; (&quot;We all love only FC Schalke&quot;),
*&quot;Wir sind die Fans&quot; (&quot;We are the fans&quot;),
*&quot;Hurra wir sind die Schalker Knappen&quot; (&quot;Hurray we are the Schalke Knappen&quot;),
*&quot;Kohle unter unser&#x27;n Füßen&quot; (&quot;Coal under our feet&quot;), and
*&quot;Steht auf, wenn ihr Schalker seid&quot; (&quot;Stand up if you&#x27;re Schalke&quot;), sung to the melody of &quot;Go West&quot; by the Pet Shop Boys (itself a cover of a Village People song).

===Revierderby===

The Revierderby is the rivalry between local clubs Schalke 04 and Borussia Dortmund, both situated in the densely populated Ruhr region, about 30 kilometers from each other. The term may be used for any match between two football clubs of the Ruhr region (such as VfL Bochum, Rot-Weiss Essen or MSV Duisburg), but it is most commonly associated with the rivalry between Schalke and Dortmund due to the derby&#x27;s popularity and prestige. To some fans, the win of the derby itself is more important than the actual performance in the Bundesliga.

==In popular culture==

Schalke has been subject of a feature-length film called &quot;Fußball ist unser Leben&quot; (&quot;Football is our life&quot;). Actors Uwe Ochsenknecht and Ralf Richter, both of whom were in the award-winning film &quot;Das Boot&quot;, played the main roles, while many persons associated with Schalke had cameo roles, such as manager Rudi Assauer, coaches Huub Stevens and Helmut Schulte, and player Yves Eigenrauch. Also featured were prominent fans like Manfred Breuckmann, Ulrich Potofski or DJ Hooligan. The film is a comedy about &quot;Hans&quot;, a Schalke fanatic, and his three pals who somehow get involved in kidnapping and trying to bring back to form the team&#x27;s new star player &quot;Di Ospeo&quot; and in the process bet Hans&#x27; house that their idol will score in the final match.

&quot;Schalke&quot; is mentioned in the film &quot;Das Boot&quot; when the bosun tells the crew in their ward room, &quot;I got bad news for you men. Schalke lost 5–0, looks like we won&#x27;t be in the final this year.&quot; This is historically inaccurate, as Schalke never lost 5–0 in an important match during the time-frame of the movie (1941).

==Coaches and management==


==Notable coaches==



==Other departments==
The basketball department played in the 1988–89 season in the National Basketball League Basketball Bundesliga and from 2004 for several seasons in the ProA, the second highest basketball league in Germany. 2009 saw Schalke 04 voluntarily withdrawal from the ProA. Currently, the team competes in ProB. The club founded a blind football department in 2015, which plays in the Blindenfußball-Bundesliga.

The women&#x27;s football club was initially dissolved in the mid-1980s, but achieved some notable successes, including five-time Westphalia championships, and competed in the German championship and DFB Cup. Schalke 04 later cooperated with , a women&#x27;s football club, from 2007 to 2010, and the current women&#x27;s team was established in July 2020, to compete in Kreisliga B, the eighth tier of women&#x27;s football, in 2021.

Other longstanding departments include the handball department, which was founded in 1926 and competed in the Gaumeister, Gauliga during Nazi Germany, and the current top division. The athletic department was founded in 1922, with the club&#x27;s former players including Olympic silver medallist decathlete Frank Busemann, and 2003 European Athletics Junior Championships gold 200-metre runner, Sebastian Ernst. The table tennis department was founded in 1947, and competes in the Westphalia district league. The women&#x27;s team was one of the early participants in the national league until it withdrew in 1956.

In 2016, Schalke acquired &quot;League of Legends&quot; e-sports team Elements, becoming the second professional sports team with a &quot;League of Legends&quot; division, after Beşiktaş. In early June, they debuted in the European &quot;League of Legends&quot; Championship Series, the top level of professional &quot;League of Legends&quot; competition in Europe. The club also announced former Rot-Weiss Oberhausen and Sportfreunde Siegen midfielder and SK Gaming co-founder Tim Reichert as Head of ESport.

<text>Houari Boumédiène (; born Mohammed ben Brahim Boukherouba; 23 August 1932 – 27 December 1978) was an Algerian military officer and politician who was the second head of state of independent Algeria from 1965 until his death in 1978. He served as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council of Algeria from 19 June 1965 until 12 December 1976 and thereafter as president of Algeria until his death.

Born in Guelma, he was educated at the Islamic Institute in Constantine. He joined the National Liberation Front in 1955 and adopted the nom de guerre Houari Boumediene. He received the rank of colonel and in 1960 became the commander of the military wing of the FLN.

President Ahmed Ben Bella appointed him Minister of Defense in 1961. He did not agree with Ben Bella&#x27;s reforms, and later overthrew him in a bloodless coup in June 1965 and put him under house arrest. He abolished the constitution and the parliament, and he himself was the chairman of the 27-member Revolutionary Council, the new institution that governed the state. The members of the council were mostly from the army. Initially he did not have much influence, but after a group of military officers attempted a coup and tried to overthrow him in 1967, he consolidated his power. The oil industry was nationalized in 1971. From the 1970s, a gradual restoration of parliamentarism and civil institutions in Algeria was initiated. This process ended with the adoption of the new constitution in 1976. The presidency was reinstated, and Boumediene was the sole candidate in an election later that year, winning with 99.46 per cent of the votes. He pursued Arab socialist and Pan-Arabist policies. He was strongly opposed to Israel and offered logistic assistance to anti-colonial movements and freedom fighters across the Arab world and Africa.

From the beginning of 1978, Boumediene appeared less and less in public. He died on December 27, 1978, after unsuccessful treatment for a rare form of blood cancer, Waldenström&#x27;s macroglobulinemia. His funeral was attended by two million mourners. He was succeeded as president by Chadli Bendjedid.

== Early life and War of Independence ==

Not much is known about Boumédiène&#x27;s early life. His place of birth variously appear as Guelma, the village of Clauzel near Guelma, or Héliopolis, and his date of birth as 16 August 1925, 23 August 1927, or in most sources as 1932. His father said in a 1965 interview that his date of birth was 23 August 1932. His birth name was Mohammed ben Brahim Boukherouba, and his father was a penniless wheat-farmer and was an Arab and strict Muslim who did not speak French. According to the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;, his family is Arabic-speaking and of Berber origins. He was educated at a Quranic school in Guelma until he was 14, then an Arabic secondary school in Constantine.

In 1952, when France was recruiting Algerians to fight in the Indochina War, Boumédiène went to Cairo, where he studied at the Al-Azhar University. It was there he first met Ahmed Ben Bella. He joined the National Liberation Front (FLN) in the Algerian War of Independence in 1955, adopting &quot;Houari Boumédiène&quot; as his nom-de-guerre (from Sidi Boumediène, the name of the patron saint of the city of Tlemcen in western Algeria, where he served as an officer during the war, and Sidi El Houari, the patron saint of nearby Oran). He reached the rank of colonel, then the highest rank in the FLN forces, and from 1960 he was chief of staff of the ALN, the FLN&#x27;s military wing.

He was married to Anissa al-Mansali.

== After independence ==

In 1962, after a referendum, Algeria declared its independence, a move affirmed by the French government. Boumédiène and Ahmed Ben Bella overthrew the provisional government of Benyoucef Benkhedda with support from the ALN in 1962. Boumédiène headed a powerful military faction within the government and was made defence minister by the Algerian president Ahmed Ben Bella, whose ascent to power he had assisted as chief of staff. Boumédiène was also appointed as Vice President of Algeria in September 1963. He grew increasingly distrustful of Ben Bella&#x27;s erratic style of government and ideological puritanism, and in June 1965, Boumédiène seized power in a bloodless coup.

The country&#x27;s constitution and political institutions were abolished, and he ruled through a Revolutionary Council of his own mostly military supporters. Many of them had been his companions during the war years, when he was based around the Moroccan border town of Oujda, which caused analysts to speak of the &quot;Oujda Group&quot;. One prominent member of this circle was Boumédiène&#x27;s long-time foreign minister, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who served as Algeria&#x27;s president from 1999 until 2019.

Initially, he was seen as potentially a weak leader, with no significant power base except inside the army, and it was not known to what extent he commanded the officer corps. He remained Algeria&#x27;s undisputed leader until his death in 1978. No significant internal challenges emerged from inside the government after the 1967 coup attempt. After the coup, he insisted on collective rule.
== Domestic policy ==
Economically, Boumédiène turned away from Ben Bella&#x27;s focus on rural Algeria and experiments in socialist cooperative businesses (&quot;l&#x27;autogestion&quot;). Instead, he opted for a more systematic and planned programme of state-driven industrialization. Algeria had virtually no advanced production at the time, but in 1971 Boumédiène nationalized the Algerian oil industry, increasing government revenue tremendously (and sparking intense protest from the French government). He then put the soaring oil and gas resources—enhanced by the oil price shock of 1973—into building heavy industry, hoping to make Algeria the Maghreb&#x27;s industrial centre. His years in power were in fact marked by a reliable and consistent economic growth, but after his death, in the 1980s, the drop in oil prices and increasingly evident inefficiency of the country&#x27;s state-run industries, prompted a change in policy towards gradual economical liberalization. Boumédiène imposed Arab socialism as the state ideology and declared Islam the state religion. He was a strong supporter of Arabization and was more assertive than Ben Bella in Arabizing Algeria, especially between 1970 and 1977, and declared 1971 the year of Arabization.

In the 1970s, along with the expansion of state industry and oil nationalization, Boumédiène declared a series of socialist revolutions, and strengthened the leftist aspect of his administration. A side-effect of this was the rapprochement with the hitherto suppressed remnants of the Algerian Communist Party (the PAGS), whose members were now co-opted into the government, where it gained some limited intellectual influence, although without formal legalization of their party. Algeria formally remained a single-party state under the FLN.

Political stability reigned, however, as attempts at challenging the state were generally nipped in the bud. As chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, Boumédiène and his associates ruled by decree. During the 1970s, constitutional rule was gradually reinstated and civilian political institutions were restored and reorganized. Efforts were made to revive activity within the FLN, and state institutions were reestablished systematically, starting with local assemblies and moving up through regional assemblies to the national level, with the election of a parliament. The process culminated with the adoption of a constitution (1976) that laid down Algeria&#x27;s political structure. This was preceded by a period of relatively open debate on the merits of the government-backed proposal, although the constitution itself was then adopted in a state-controlled referendum with no major changes. The constitution reintroduced the office of president. As the leader of the FLN, Boumédiène was the sole candidate for president, and was confirmed in office in a December referendum.

At the time of his death, later that year, the political and constitutional order in Algeria was virtually entirely of FLN design. This structure remained largely unchanged until the late 1980s, when political pluralism was introduced and the FLN lost its role as dominant single party. (Many basic aspects of this system and the Boumédiène-era constitution are still in place.) However, throughout Boumédiène&#x27;s era, the military remained the dominant force in the country&#x27;s politics, and military influence permeated civilian institutions such as the FLN, parliament and government, undercutting the constitutionalization of the country&#x27;s politics. Intense financial or political rivalries between military and political factions persisted, and was kept in check and prevented from destabilizing the government mainly by Boumédiène&#x27;s overwhelming personal dominance of both the civilian and military sphere.

Algeria experienced significant economic and social development under his government. Between 1962 and 1982, the Algerian population increased from 10 to 20 million people and, massively rural before independence, 45% of the population was urbanized. Annual per capita income, which did not exceed 2,000 francs in 1962, exceeds 11,000 francs twenty years later, while the enrolment rate varies from 75 to 95% depending on the region, far from the 10% of French Algeria. However, Boumédiène’s regime prioritized industrial development, which led it neglecting agriculture.

== Foreign policy ==
Boumédiène pursued a policy of non-alignment, maintaining good relations with both the communist bloc and the capitalist nations, and promoting third-world cooperation. In the United Nations, he called for a unity built on equal status for western and ex-colonial nations, and brought about by a socialist-style change in political and trade relations. He sought to build a powerful third world bloc through the Non-Aligned Movement, in which he became a prominent figure. He unconditionally supported freedom fighters, justice and equality seekers. He offered logistic assistance to anti-colonial movements and other militant groups across Africa and the Arab world, including the PLO, ANC, SWAPO and other nations.

Algeria remained strongly opposed to Israel and a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause. In the early 1970s, Boumédiène famously said: &quot;We are with Palestinians, whether they are the oppressed or the oppressor”. Algeria reinforced the Arab coalition with air forces against Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and sent an armored brigade of 150 tanks in the Yom Kippur War in 1973, where Algerian fighter jets participated in attacks together with Egyptians and Iraqis. It also deposited $200 million with the Soviet Union to finance arms purchases for Egypt and Syria. In response to the US support for Israel in the Six-Day War, Algeria severed diplomatic ties with USA. It participated in the 1973 oil embargo after the US supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. In response to Egypt&#x27;s normalization of ties with Israel, Algeria along with other Arab countries condemned Anwar Sadat and severed ties with Egypt in 1977.

Algeria bought the majority of arms from the Soviet Union.

A significant regional event was his 1975 pledge of support for Western Saharan self-determination, admitting Sahrawi refugees and the Polisario Front national liberation movement to Algerian territory, after Morocco and Mauritania claimed control over the territory. This ended the possibility of mending relations with Morocco, already sour after the 1963 Sand War, although there had been a modest thaw in relations during his first time in power. The heightened Moroccan-Algerian rivalry and the still unsolved Western Sahara question became a defining feature of Algerian foreign policy ever since and remains so today.

== Death and funeral ==
In 1978, his appearances became increasingly rare. After lingering in a coma for 39 days, he died in Algiers of a rare blood disease, Waldenström&#x27;s macroglobulinemia, following unsuccessful treatment in Moscow. Rumors about his being assassinated or poisoned have surfaced occasionally in Algerian politics, especially after two other participants of the 1975 Algiers Agreement events — the Shah (d. 1980) and his Minister of Court Asadollah Alam (d. 1978) — also died of cancers around the same time. The death of Boumédiène left a power vacuum in Algeria which could not easily be filled; a series of military conclaves eventually agreed to sidestep the competing left- and right-wing contenders, and designate the highest-ranking military officer, Colonel Chadli Bendjedid, as a compromise selection.

Boumédiène&#x27;s state funeral took place in Algiers on 29 December 1978. A crowd of two million mourners attended, breaking through police cordons and blocking the routes. The Algerian government promised to continue his socialist revolution and declared 90 days of official mourning. Despite their differences over the Camp David Accords, Egyptian president Anwar Sadat paid tribute to Boumédiène and said he received the news of his death &quot;with sorrow and sadness&quot; and sent a delegation to attend the funeral. PLO leader Yasser Arafat attended the funeral with the second in command of his Fatah guerrilla organization, Abu Iyad, who had built close relations with Boumédiène. US President Jimmy Carter expressed deep regret and said that Boumédiène &quot;played an outstanding role in Algeria&#x27;s long struggle for independence. His devotion to duty and his contributions as an international statesman are well known. But it is for his efforts to help create and strengthen an independent, self-sufficient Algerian nation that he will be most remembered&quot;. A large United States delegation attended, which included Muhammad Ali. The Soviet press praised Boumédiène as &quot;a great friend of the Soviet Union&quot; and that he had &quot;made a great contribution to Algeria&#x27;s social and economic progress.&quot;

<doc id="410351" wikidata="Q22421392" url="?curid=410351" title="Victoria Park, London, Ontario">
<text>Victoria Park is an 7.3 hectare (18-acre) park located in downtown London, Ontario, in Canada. It is one of the major centres of community events in London.

==History==
The park was originally the site of the British garrison, as well as the cricket grounds. The garrison was expanded with new buildings during and after the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837. The British troops withdrew to Europe in 1853 to train for the Crimean War, but their barracks were used to house escaped slaves from the United States, as one of the end stations of the Underground Railway. The troops returned in 1861, fearing that the American Civil War might spread to Canada. In 1874, the park was transferred to the city and renamed Victoria Park, after Queen Victoria.

The park&#x27;s original plan was the work of the landscape architect Charles H. Miller, chief gardener of Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and designer of the American Centennial Exposition grounds. It is believed that the decision to hire Miller was strongly influenced by William Saunders&#x27; visit to the exposition grounds in 1876.

Although designated for recreational activities, the park was still used as a military garrison when necessary. As London was the centre of the Western Ontario military district (District No. 1), troops were stationed in the park during the Second Boer War, World War I, and World War II; there was some minor rioting in the park during the Conscription Crisis of 1944, when conscripts demanded to be sent to Europe.

In 1907, three cannons from the Crimean War were placed in the park, originally from Sevastopol. In 1912 a statue was built as a memorial to the Boer War, and an exact replica of the cenotaph in Whitehall, London, England was built in 1934. A Sherman tank (known as the &quot;Holy Roller&quot;) used in World War II was placed there in 1950. While the park once housed elaborate fountains and a lilypond, there are no water features remaining today.

==Activities==
Many annual events are held in Victoria Park. These include Sunfest, the Home County Folk Festival, The London Rib-Fest, The International Food Festival, LOLA and Fiesta del Sol. Since 2008 all events in Victoria Park are part of the Greening of the Festivals and required to have a waste management plan to eliminate unnecessary waste to landfill. This includes a suitable number of Eco-Stations (the place where attendees dispose of waste) and all food and beverage containers are required to be either recyclable or compostable. In the first year, these efforts led to an improvement from 5% waste diversion to a 50% waste diversion from landfill. The festivals were recognized Nationally with a Home Town Heroes Award, Provincially with a Gold Award from the Recycling Council of Ontario for Minimization of Waste and Municipally with the Pillar non profit Community Impact Award. Home County Folk Festival had the added initiative of offering reusable metal dishes, available on deposit which is repaid at the Eco-Stations, to eliminate one time use disposables altogether. With the EcoStations readily available for waste disposal, Victoria Park has been a cleaner park throughout the festival season. In addition, the festivals have educated hundreds of thousands of festival attendees on wasteful practices and inspired them to take these practices to their community events, birthday parties and church suppers.

Every winter, there is an annual vigil for the École Polytechnique Massacre, the trees in the park are decorated with Christmas lights, the &quot;Lighting of the Lights&quot; and Snowfest is held in February. The number and frequency of events has been a concern for the park with the resulting damage to the foliage, prompting some partial rescheduling to minimize the wear.

The park also has an ice skating rink in the winter, which has been built every winter since 1913. The bandshell was built in 1950 (rebuilt in 1990). The area in front of the bandshell now serves as a free, public skatepark, consisting of many metal benches and a stage drop (security persists on no one to sit or utilize the bandshell except for festivals or major events). Near the bandshell is the Women&#x27;s Memorial for the victims of the École Polytechnique massacre in Montreal, built in 1994.

The park is notable for the presence of a large number of melanistic (black) Eastern Gray Squirrels (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;), and because of this, the recreational sport of squirrel fishing has developed in the area. However the squirrel population is not indigenous; they were first introduced to the park in 1914, when four pairs of squirrels were purchased. In February 1961 a group of squirrels were taken to Kent State University, in Ohio, United States, where they have become firmly established.

<text>The 7 Flushing Local and &lt;7&gt; Flushing Express are two rapid transit services in the A Division of the New York City Subway, providing local and express services along the full length of the IRT Flushing Line. Their route emblems, or &quot;bullets&quot;, are colored , since they serve the Flushing Line.

The 7 operates 24 hours a day between Main Street in Flushing, Queens and 34th Street–Hudson Yards in Chelsea, Manhattan, making all stops along the full route. Additional service operates along the full route and makes express stops in Queens between Mets–Willets Point and Queensboro Plaza during rush hours in the peak direction instead of making all stops; these trains labeled as &lt;7&gt; Express trains. Super express service operates after special events at Citi Field or the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in the southbound direction only.

The 7 route started running in 1915 when the Flushing Line opened. Since 1927, the 7 has held largely the same route, except for a one-stop western extension from Times Square to Hudson Yards on September 13, 2015.
==Service history==
=== Early history ===
On June 13, 1915, the first test train on the IRT Flushing Line ran between Grand Central and Vernon Boulevard–Jackson Avenue, followed by the start of revenue service on June 22. The Flushing Line was extended one stop from Vernon–Jackson Avenue to Hunters Point Avenue on February 15, 1916. On November 5, 1916, the Flushing Line was extended two more stops east to the Queensboro Plaza station. The line was opened from Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza) on April 21, 1917. Service to 111th Street was inaugurated on October 13, 1925, with shuttle service running between 111th Street, and the previous terminal at Alburtis Avenue on the Manhattan-bound track.

On March 22, 1926, Flushing Line service was extended one stop westward from Grand Central to Fifth Avenue, when that portion of the Flushing Line was opened. The line was extended to Times Square almost exactly a year later, on March 14, 1927. Though an eastward extension to Willets Point Boulevard opened on May 7 of the same year, service was provided by shuttle trains for the first week, until through service was inaugurated. The eastern extension to Flushing–Main Street opened on January 21, 1928.

The service on the Flushing Line east of Queensboro Plaza was shared by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) from 1912 to 1949; BMT trains were designated 9, while IRT services were designated 7 on maps only. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The Times Square to Flushing route became known as the 7.

=== Introduction of express service ===
Express trains began running on April 24, 1939, to serve the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The first train left Main Street at 6:30 a.m. local time. IRT expresses ran every nine minutes between Main Street and Times Square, with BMT expresses having a similar frequency, running just between Main Street and Queensboro Plaza. The running time between Main Street and Queensboro Plaza was 15 minutes and the running time between Main Street and Times Square was 27 minutes. Express service to Manhattan operated in the morning rush between 6:30 and 10:43 a.m. Express service to Main Street began from Times Square for the IRT at 10:50 a.m. and the BMT from Queensboro Plaza at 11:09 a.m., continuing until 8 p.m.

On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the Flushing Line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths, and the BMT Astoria Line platforms extended to 10 BMT car lengths. The project, to start in 1950, would cost . The platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars, or seven 60-foot-long BMT cars beforehand.

On March 12, 1953, two 9-car super express trains began operating from Flushing–Main Street to Times Square in the morning rush hour. The super expresses stopped at Willets Point before skipping all stops to Queensboro Plaza, bypassing the Woodside and Junction Boulevard express stops. The running time was cut down to 23 minutes from 25 minutes. Beginning August 12, 1955, four super expresses operated during the morning rush hour. On September 10, 1953, two express trains from Times Square were converted to super express trains in the evening rush hour. Super express service was discontinued in the morning rush and evening rush, on January 13, 1956, and December 14, 1956, respectively. Holiday and Saturday express service was discontinued on March 20, 1954.

On November 1, 1962, fifty R17s (numbers 6500–6549) were transferred from the Mainline IRT to the 7, allowing for ten-car operation. This was the first time that the IRT ran ten-car trains without a second conductor. With the 1964–1965 World&#x27;s Fair in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in April 1964, trains were lengthened to eleven cars. The Flushing Line received 430 new R33 and R36 &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars for this enhanced service.

=== Rehabilitation service patterns ===

==== First renovation ====

From May 13, 1985, to August 21, 1989, the IRT Flushing Line was overhauled for improvements, including the installation of new track, repair of station structures and to improve line infrastructure. The project cost $70 million. Temporary platforms were built at local stations along the line when track work was being performed on local track in station areas to provide access to trains.

The major element was the replacement of rails on the Queens Boulevard viaduct. This was necessitated because the subway was allowed to deteriorate during the 1970s and 1980s to the point that there were widespread &quot;Code Red&quot; defects on the Flushing Line, and there were some pillars holding elevated structures that were so shaky that trains would not run if the wind exceeded . &lt;7&gt; express service was suspended for the duration of the project; however, extra 7 service was provided for Mets games and Flushing Meadows Park events. During the project, delays of up to 10 minutes on weekdays, and 20 minutes on weekends were expected. The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) had considered running express bus service to replace &lt;7&gt; express service, but decided against it as it would require hundreds of buses, which the NYCTA did not have. During the construction project, the NYCTA operated 25 trains per hour on the local track, three fewer than the 28 trains per hour split between the local and express beforehand. Running times on the 7 were lengthened by ten minutes during the project.

==== Resumption of express service ====
The project was completed in June 1989, six months ahead of its scheduled completion of December 1989. The NYCTA held a public hearing on June 29, 1989, concerning its proposed reinstatement of express service. The NYCTA proposed implementing express service in July 1989 to coincide with changes in regular A Division schedules. It began to plan options to reinstate express service in 1988. Options were presented to local community boards, including the service pattern in place before May 1985, the continuation of all-local service, Super Express service running nonstop between Willets Point and Queensboro Plaza and Skip-Stop Express service.

Before May 1985, express service operated to Manhattan from 6:30 to 9:45 a.m. and to Main Street from 3:15 to 7:30 p.m. Expresses ran every three minutes on average and locals ran every six minutes; due to the uneven split in service, in practice one express train would be followed two minutes later by another express train, and then an additional four minutes would elapse until the next express train arrived. This split between expresses and locals was in place due to high demand for express trains. Express trains that arrived four minutes after the previous trip had carried twice as many passengers than the expresses that arrived two minutes afterward. With the elimination of express service and the unreliable merge at 33rd Street, service reliability had increased, with on-time performance often exceeding 95%. Keeping local-only service was dismissed as it would not have saved times for the large number of riders boarding east of Junction Boulevard heading to Manhattan, because it did not provide for the most efficient use of subway cars, and because it did not provide an attractive alternative to the overcrowded Queens Boulevard Line. Super express service was dismissed as the demand for local service would require two or three locals for every express, replicating the problem of the pre-1985 service pattern. Skip-stop service was dismissed for limiting the capacity of the line to 24 trains per hour, from the line&#x27;s capacity of 30 trains per hour under other service patterns for express service.

The NYCTA created a service plan with the goals of maintaining existing levels of reliability, having local service run at existing levels or higher than the pre-1985 level, and providing faster running times. The NYCTA proposed the reintroduction of express service, running to Manhattan between 6:30 and 10 a.m. (changed to 6:30 to 9:45 a.m. at the time of implementation) and to Flushing between 3:15 and 8:15 p.m.. Express service would bypass 61st Street–Woodside, allowing one express train to run for every local, with expresses and locals both running every four minutes. The operation of expresses and locals at even frequencies was expected to aid in the even spacing of trains arriving at 33rd Street. The fast express service was expected to discourage riders boarding north of Junction Boulevard to transfer to the crowded Queens Boulevard Line. The elimination of Woodside as an express stop was done in part because trains at the station would be held up by passengers transferring between the local and the express, which led to delays at the 33rd Street merge, negating the time savings. On July 28, 1989, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Board approved the change by a vote of 5–3. &lt;7&gt; express service was restored on August 21, 1989, pushed back from July. Express service saved six minutes from Main Street to Manhattan and four minutes from Junction Boulevard. In September 1989, 200 riders and Republican Mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani rallied at the 61st Street station to protest the elimination of express service. Express service resumed stopping at Woodside on a six-week test basis on February 10, 1992, after pressure from community opposition.

==== Second renovation ====
In the mid-1990s, the MTA discovered that the Queens Boulevard viaduct structure was unstable, as rocks that were used to support the tracks as ballast became loose due to poor drainage, which, in turn, affected the integrity of the concrete structure overall. &lt;7&gt; express service was suspended again between 61st Street–Woodside and Queensboro Plaza; temporary platforms were installed to access the express track in the four intermediate stations. The work began on April 5, 1993. When the viaduct reconstruction finished on March 31, 1997, ahead of schedule, full &lt;7&gt; express service was reinstated. Throughout this entire period, ridership grew steadily.

=== Extension and CBTC ===

The 7 Subway Extension, which travels west and south to 34th Street and 11th Avenue, near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Hudson Yards, was delayed five times. The 34th Street–Hudson Yards station, originally scheduled to open in December 2013, then pushed to May 2014. And then pushed again to September 13, 2015, and has been serving passengers ever since. However, the overall station construction project was not completed until early September 2018.

In 2010, New York City officials announced they were considering a further extension of the service across the Hudson River to the Secaucus Junction train station in New Jersey. Though the project was supported by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and New Jersey governor Chris Christie, MTA chairman Joseph Lhota announced in 2013 that the New Jersey extension would not be pursued, in favor of the Gateway Tunnel project, which entails a new tunnel to Manhattan for Amtrak and NJ Transit trains. As part of a joint effort between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the MTA, and NJ Transit, this extension was considered again in February 2018.

In 2008, the MTA started converting the 7 service to accommodate communications-based train control (CBTC). Originally expected to cost $585.9 million, the installation of CBTC was intended to allow two additional trains per hour as well as two additional trains for the 7 Subway Extension, providing a 7% increase in capacity. At the former southern terminal, Times Square, service on the 7 was limited to 27 trains per hour as a result of the bumper blocks there. The new southern terminal at 34th Street–Hudson Yards has tail tracks to store rush-hour trains and can increase the service frequency to 29 trains per hour. New CBTC-compatible cars for the A Division (the R188 contract) were delivered from 2013 to 2016. In October 2017, the CBTC system was activated from Main Street to 74th Street. On November 26, 2018, following numerous delays, CBTC was activated on the remainder of the 7 route.

From June 26, 2023, through January 2025, &lt;7&gt; express trains are making all stops between Queensboro Plaza and 74th Street–Broadway due to renovations along the Flushing Line.

== Rolling stock ==
The 7 operates with 11-car sets; the number of cars in a single 7 train set is more than in any other New York City Subway service. These trains, however, are not the longest in the system, since a train of 11 &quot;A&quot; Division cars is only long, while a standard B Division train, which consists of ten cars or eight cars, is long.

===Fleet history===

The 7, throughout almost all its history, has maintained a separate fleet from the rest of the IRT, starting with the Steinway Low-Vs. The Steinways were built between 1915 and 1925 specifically for use in the Steinway Tunnel. They had special gear ratios to climb the steep grades (4.5%) in the Steinway Tunnel, something standard Interborough equipment could not do.

In 1938, an order of World&#x27;s Fair Lo-V cars was placed with the St. Louis Car Company. These cars broke from IRT &quot;tradition&quot; in that they did not have vestibules at each car end. In addition, because the IRT was bankrupt at the time, the cars were built as single ended cars, with train controls for the motorman on one side and door controls for the conductor on the other.

Starting in 1948, R12s, R14s, and R15s were delivered to the 7. On November 1, 1962, fifty R17s (6500–6549) were transferred from the Mainline IRT to the 7, allowing for ten-car operation. This was the first time that the IRT ran ten-car trains without a second conductor.

In 1964, picture window R33S and R36 cars replaced the older R12s, R14s, R15s, and R17s in time for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Early in 1965, the NYCTA placed a strip map indicating all the stations and transfer points for the line in each of the line&#x27;s 430 cars, helping World&#x27;s Fair visitors. This innovation was not used for other services and as they shared rolling stock with each other; it was possible for cars to have the wrong strip maps.

The 7 was the last service to run using &quot;Redbird&quot; cars, and the 7″s fleet consisted entirely of R33S/R36 Redbird trains until February 2002. In 2001, with the arrival of the R142/R142A cars, the Transit Authority announced the retirement of all Redbird cars. From January 2002 to November 2003, Bombardier-built R62A cars from other routes gradually replaced all of the Redbird cars on the 7. The first R62As entered service on the 7 route on February 19, 2002. On November 3, 2003, the last Redbird train made its final trip on this route, making all stops between Times Square and the then-named Willets Point–Shea Stadium. Several Redbird cars running on this service were decorated with Mets logos and colors during the 2000 World Series against the New York Yankees, as the Flushing Line runs adjacent to Citi Field and the former location of Shea Stadium.

By 2008, all R62As on the 7 were upgraded with LED lighted signs to distinguish between express and local trains. These signs are located on the rollsigns that are found on the side of each car. The local is a green circle around the 7 bullet while the express is a red diamond. Previously, the rollsigns showed either a (7) (within a circle) or a &lt;7&gt; (within a diamond) with the word &quot;Express&quot; underneath it.

The R62As were displaced by the R188s from January 2014 to March 30, 2018, in preparation for the automation equipment for the Flushing Line. The displaced R62As were returned to the train, from which many R142As were taken and converted to R188s. The first train of R188 cars began operating in passenger service on November 9, 2013. By 2016, most of the CBTC-equipped R188 train sets were on the 7, and by March 30, 2018, the last R62A trains were displaced by the R188 cars.

==Nickname==
The 7 is unofficially nicknamed the &quot;International Express&quot; and the &quot;Orient Express&quot;, in part because it travels through several different ethnic neighborhoods populated by immigrants, especially along Roosevelt Avenue, and also because it was the principal subway route to the 1964–65 New York World&#x27;s Fair. On June 26, 1999, First Lady Hillary Clinton and U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater designated the 7 route as a National Millennium Trail (under the name &quot;International Express&quot;), along with 15 other routes including the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and the Underground Railroad.

==Route==

===Service pattern===
The following table shows the line used by the 7 and &lt;7&gt;, with shaded boxes indicating the route at the specified times:
&lt;7&gt; trains typically run express east of Queensboro Plaza. , due to structural renovations on the IRT Flushing Line, &lt;7&gt; trains only run express east of 74th Street–Broadway.

In addition to regular local and rush-hour express services, &quot;Super Express&quot; service to Manhattan is also provided after New York Mets games weeknights and weekends at Citi Field, as well as after US Open tennis matches: starting at Mets–Willets Point and operating express to Manhattan, also bypassing Junction Boulevard, Hunters Point Avenue and Vernon Boulevard–Jackson Avenue. As of 2023, Super Express trains only bypass Hunters Point Avenue and Vernon Boulevard–Jackson Avenue due to work on the IRT Flushing Line.

===Stations===
The 7 and &lt;7&gt; run on the IRT Flushing Line in their entirety. Stations in blue denote stops served by Super Express game specials.


==In popular culture==
* The 2000 documentary film &quot;The #7 Train: An Immigrant Journey&quot; is based on the ethnic diversity of the people that ride the 7 train every day.
* The 7 Line Army is a group of New York Mets fans whose name is derived from the 7 route.
* In a 1999 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; interview, then-Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker controversially stated that riding the 7 train is &quot;like you&#x27;re [riding through] Beirut next to some kid with purple hair next to some queer with AIDS right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It&#x27;s depressing. The biggest thing I don&#x27;t like about New York are the foreigners. You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking English. Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and Russians and Spanish people and everything up there. How the hell did they get in this country?&quot;
* The PC simulator game &quot;World of Subways 4&quot; released in March 2015 by Aerosoft is a recreation of the 7 during the time the redbirds operated the line. It features a driving simulation in different conditions, as well as missions with storylines loosely related to the 7&#x27;s operation.
* In January 2020, as part of an agreement between the MTA and Comedy Central to promote actor Awkwafina&#x27;s TV show &quot;Nora From Queens&quot;, the default pre-recorded announcements for the 7 train on the R188s were replaced with those from Awkwafina for one week. The announcements from Awkwafina featured jokes in addition to the standard station announcements. The agreement was the first time that the MTA has replaced train announcements as a form of advertising.
* In September 2022, New York Mets television broadcast announcers Ron Darling, Keith Hernandez, and Gary Cohen pre-recorded announcements along the 7 line.
* In April 2024, the Mets unveiled their City Connect uniforms, which allude to the 7-line through their use of the color purple.
* On October 8, 2024, the McDonald&#x27;s mascot Grimace rode a 7 train branded with imagery featuring the character before Game 3 of the 2024 National League Division Series between the Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies.

<doc id="410355" wikidata="Q69103" url="?curid=410355" title="Hassan II of Morocco">
<text>Hassan II (; 9 July 1929 – 23 July 1999) was King of Morocco from 1961 until his death in 1999. A member of the Alawi dynasty, he was the eldest son of King Mohammed V, and his second wife Princess Abla bint Tahar.

He was named crown prince in 1957 and was the first commander-in-chief of the Royal Armed Forces. He was enthroned as king in 1961 following his father&#x27;s death. His reign was marked by the start of the Western Sahara conflict and the Sand War, as well as two failed coup attempts against him in 1971 and in 1972. Hassan&#x27;s conservative approach reportedly strengthened his rule over Morocco and the Western Sahara. He was accused of authoritarian practices, as well as human rights and civil rights abuses, particularly during the Years of Lead. A truth commission was set up after his death to investigate allegations of human rights violations during his reign.

== Early life and education ==
&quot;Mawlay&quot; al-Hassan bin Mohammed bin Yusef al-Alawi was born on 9 July 1929 at the Dar al-Makhzen in Rabat, during the French protectorate in Morocco, as the eldest son to Sultan Mohammed V and his second wife, Lalla Abla bint Tahar, as a member of the &#x27;Alawi dynasty.

He first studied Islamic sciences at the Dar al-Makhzen in Fez. He then became a student at the Royal College in Rabat, where instruction was conducted in Arabic and French and a class was created for him. Mehdi Ben Barka was notably his mathematics teacher for four years at the Royal College. In June 1948, he obtained his baccalaureate from the Royal College.

Hassan pursued his higher education at the Rabat Institute of Higher Studies, a department of the University of Bordeaux, from where he received a law degree in 1951. In 1952, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in public law from the University of Bordeaux before serving in the French Navy on board the Jeanne d&#x27;Arc cruiser. He was a doctoral student at the Faculty of Law of Bordeaux in 1953, when his family&#x27;s exile occurred. After having ascended the throne, on 25 June 1963, Dean Lajugie presented him with the insignia of Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Bordeaux.

== Heir apparent ==

In 1943, a twelve-year-old Hassan attended the Casablanca Conference at the Anfa Hotel along with his father, where he met United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and General Charles de Gaulle. In 1947, he attended his father&#x27;s speech in what was then the Tangier International Zone. In the speech, Sultan Mohammed wished for the French and Spanish protectorates and the Tangier International Zone to be unified into one nation. The speech became a reference for Moroccan nationalists and anti-colonial movements and later led to Morocco&#x27;s independence.

Hassan later claimed that he had &quot;profound resentment&quot; towards the protectorate and that he felt &quot;deep humiliation&quot; from French colonialism. Despite paying hommage to Hubert Lyautey, the first resident-general of the French protectorate, he was highly critical of Lyautey&#x27;s successors, noting their &quot;stubborn stupidity&quot; and &quot;total insensitivity&quot;.

Hassan and his family were forced into exile by French authorities on 20 August 1953, being deported to Zonza in Corsica. Their deportation led to protests and further fueled the anti-colonial movement. They moved to the city of L&#x27;Île-Rousse and lived at the Napoléon Bonaparte hotel for five months before being transferred to Antsirabe, Madagascar in January 1954. During this time, Mohammed Ben Aarafa was named sultan in Morocco by the French government.

Prince Hassan acted as his father&#x27;s political advisor during their exile. They returned to Morocco on 16 November 1955. He participated with his father in the February 1956 negotiations for Moroccan independence. Following Morocco&#x27;s independence from France, his father named him commander-in-chief of the newly founded Royal Moroccan Armed Forces in April 1956. The same year, he led army contingents to victory after defeating rebel militias during the Rif revolt. It was during his tenure as commander-in-chief that he met General Mohamed Oufkir, who became Minister of Defense during his reign. Oufkir would later suspected of orchestrating a failed coup d&#x27;état to kill Hassan in 1972.

After Mohammed V changed the title of the Moroccan sovereign from Sultan to King in 1957, Hassan was proclaimed Crown Prince on 9 July 1957. In this position, he was the president of the organising committee of the International Meeting at the monastery of Toumliline in 1957 and gave a welcome speech.

== Reign ==
Hassan ascended the throne on 26 February 1961 on his father&#x27;s death. His enthronement took place at the Royal Palace of Rabat on 3 March 1961, and he also inherited the position of prime minister.

=== Domestic policy ===

In 1962, Hassan and his aides wrote Morocco&#x27;s first constitution, defining the kingdom as a social and democratic constitutional monarchy, making Islam the state religion, and creating the title of &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot; and &quot;supreme representative of the nation&quot; for the king, whose person was defined as &quot;inviolable and sacred&quot;. The constitution also reaffirmed a multi-party political system, the only one which existed in the Maghreb at that time. The constitution provoked strong political protest from the UNFP and the Istiqlal and other leftist parties that formed the opposition at the time.

Hassan&#x27;s reign was infamous for a poor human rights record labeled as &quot;appalling&quot; by the BBC. It was, however, at its worst during the period from the 1960s to the late 1980s, which was labelled as the &quot;years of lead&quot; and saw thousands of dissidents jailed, killed, exiled or forcibly disappeared. The country would only become relatively freer by the early 1990s under strong international pressure and condemnation over its human rights record. Since then, Morocco&#x27;s human rights record has improved modestly and improved significantly during the reign of Hassan&#x27;s successor Mohammed VI. In 2004, the Equity and Reconciliation Commission was created by Mohammed to investigate human rights abuses during his father&#x27;s reign.

Hassan imprisoned many members of the National Union of Popular Forces and sentenced some party leaders, including Mehdi Ben Barka, to death. A series of student protests began on 21 March 1965 in Casablanca, and devolved into general riots the following day; the resulting violent repression led to hundreds of deaths. In the aftermath, on 26 March, Hassan gave a speech that he concluded with: &quot;There is no greater danger to a country than a so-called intellectual; it would have been better if you had all been illiterate.&quot;

In June, he dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution of 1962, declaring a state of exception that would last more than five years, in which he ruled Morocco directly; however, he did not completely abolish the mechanisms of parliamentary democracy. An alleged report from the U.S. Secretary of State claimed that, during this period, &quot;Hassan [appeared] obsessed with the preservation of his power rather than with its application toward the resolution of Morocco&#x27;s multiplying domestic problems.&quot;

In October 1965, Mehdi Ben Barka, a key political opponent and fierce critic of Hassan, was kidnapped and disappeared in Paris. In &quot;Rise and Kill First&quot;, Ronen Bergman points to cooperation between the Moroccan authorities and Israel&#x27;s Mossad in locating Ben Barka.

In 1990, following riots in Fez, Hassan set up the Consultative Human Rights Council to look into allegations of abuse by the State. In 1991, he pardoned two thousand prisoners, including political prisoners and people held in secret prisons including in Tazmamart. In 1998, the first opposition-led government was elected.

During his reign, Morocco was labeled as &quot;partly free&quot; by Freedom House, except for a &quot;not free&quot; ranking in 1992.

=== Attempted coups d&#x27;état ===
In the early 1970s, Hassan survived two assassination attempts. The first occurred on 10 July 1971 during his forty-second birthday party at his palace in Skhirat, near Rabat. The attempted coup was carried out by up to 1,400 army cadets from the Ahermoumou military training academy led by General Mohamed Medbouh and Colonel M&#x27;hamed Ababou. Hassan was reported to have hidden in a bathroom whilst grenades were thrown and rapid shots were fired. The rebels also raided and took over the offices of the RTM, Morocco&#x27;s state-owned broadcasting company, broadcasting propaganda claiming that the king had been murdered and that a republic had been founded. Ababou gave orders to rebels through Radio-Maroc, ordering the execution of everyone in the palace by asking that &quot;dinner be served to everyone by 7 pm&quot; on air. The coup ended the same day when royalist troops took over the palace in combat against the rebels. After firing died down, Hassan ended up face-to-face with one of the rebel commanders; he reportedly intimidated the leader of the rebel troops by reciting a verse of the Quran, and the commander knelt and kissed his right hand.

An estimated 400 people were killed by rebels during the attempted coup; loyal troops within the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces under the command of Hassan killed more than 150 and detained 900 people in connection with the coup. It was subsequently claimed by Moroccan authorities that the young cadets had been misled by senior officers into thinking that they were acting to protect the king. Hassan himself had claimed that the coup was supported by Libya, raising tensions between the two countries. The next day, Hassan attended the funerals of royalist soldiers killed during the attempted coup.On 16 August 1972, during a second coup attempt, six F-5 military jets from the Royal Moroccan Air Force opened fire on the king&#x27;s Boeing 727 while flying at a altitude over Tétouan on the way to Rabat from Barcelona, killing eight people on board and injuring fifty. A bullet hit the fuselage but they failed to take the plane down despite it being badly damaged. The military jets were loaded with practice ammunition rather than missiles, severely impacting the coup&#x27;s effectiveness. Hassan hurried to the cockpit, took control of the radio, and reportedly shouted: &quot;Stop firing, the tyrant is dead!&quot;; however, conflicting reports state that he posed as a mechanic and stated that both pilots died and the king was badly injured, convincing the pilots to stop.

220 members of the Air Force were arrested for partaking in the coup plot, 177 of whom were acquitted, 32 were found guilty, and 11 people were sentenced to death by a military tribunal. After making an emergency landing at Rabat–Salé International Airport, Hassan escaped to his palace in Shkirat in an unmarked car. Mohamed Amekrane, a colonel suspected to be a main part of the coup, attempted to flee to Gibraltar; however, his asylum application was declined and he was sent back to Morocco. He was later sentenced to death by firing squad. General Mohamed Oufkir, Morocco&#x27;s defense minister at the time, was suspected to have led the coup; he was later found dead from multiple gunshot wounds, with his death officially determined to be a suicide. Hassan declared that he &quot;must not place [his] trust in anyone&quot; after what he perceived as treason from Oufkir. The attempted coups reportedly reinforced his rule over Morocco.

=== Foreign policy ===

Hassan&#x27;s first official foreign visit as King was to attend the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, which took place in September 1961 in Belgrade.

In the Cold War era, Hassan allied Morocco with the West generally, and with the United States and France in particular. His obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;a monarch oriented to the west&quot;. There were close and continuing ties between the royal government and the CIA, who helped to reorganize Morocco&#x27;s security forces in 1960. During Hassan&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, Morocco controversially accepted Soviet military aid and made overtures towards Moscow. During an interview, he stated that &quot;as an Islamic people, [Morocco has] the right to practice bigamy. We can wed East and West and be faithful to both&quot;.

In 1975, he created the Al-Quds Committee, a non-governmental organization aimed to &quot;preserve the Arab-Muslim character&quot; of Jerusalem. It works on the restoration of mosques and the creation of hospitals and schools in the city. The committee also gives out scholarship to students living in the city, as well as donating equipment to schools and kindergartens. Hassan also admitted , a French member of the Holy See and one of his personal friends, to the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco. Calmels was responsible for bringing about a rapprochement between Islam and Christianity.

Hassan was alleged to have covertly cooperated with the State of Israel and Israeli intelligence. In what was termed Operation Yachin, he negotiated for the migration of over 97,000 Moroccan Jews to Israel from 1961 to 1964 in exchange for weapons and training for Morocco&#x27;s security forces and intelligence agencies. The Moroccan Jewish community was historically among the largest in the Muslim world. In an arrangement financed by the American Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), Hassan was paid a sum of $500,000 along with $100 for each of the first 50,000 Moroccan Jews to be migrated to Israel, and $250 for each Jewish emigrant thereafter.

Hassan served as a mediator between Arab countries and Israel. In 1977, he served as a key backchannel in peace talks between Egypt and Israel, hosting secret meetings between Israeli and Egyptian officials; these meetings led to the Egypt–Israel peace treaty.

According to Shlomo Gazit, during an interview with Yedioth Ahronoth, then-leader of the Military Intelligence Directorate, Hassan invited Mossad and Shin Bet agents to bug the Casablanca hotel hosting the 1965 Arab League summit to record conversations of participating Arab leaders. This information was instrumental in Israel&#x27;s victory in the Six-Day War. Ronen Bergman claimed in his book, &quot;Rise And Kill First&quot;, that Israeli intelligence then supplied information leading to Mehdi Ben Barka&#x27;s capture and assassination. Bergman also alleged that the Moroccan DST and Mossad collaborated in a 1996 plot to assassinate Osama bin Laden. The plot involved a woman close to bin Laden who was an informant for the DST; however, the mission was aborted due to rising tensions between Morocco and Israel.

Relations with Mauritania remained strained due to Moroccan claims to the entirety of Mauritanian territory, with Morocco only recognizing Mauritania as a sovereign state in 1969, nearly a decade after the latter&#x27;s declaration of independence. In 1984, as a result of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) joining the Organisation of African Unity two years prior, Hassan declared the suspension of Morocco&#x27;s membership of the organisation. Morocco entered into a diplomatic crisis with Burkinabé President Thomas Sankara following his decision to recognize the SADR.

Hassan was close to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran, even hosting him in 1979 when he was exiled.

=== Armed conflicts ===
On 14 October 1963, the Sand War was declared as a result of failed negotiations over borders inherited from French colonialism between Hassan and Algeria&#x27;s newly elected president Ahmed Ben Bella. The war heavily damaged both countries&#x27; economies, and the king ordered his citizens to call off Eid al-Adha festivities in part due to the economic recession caused by the war. A peace treaty and armistice ended the war on 15 January 1969. Hassan later claimed that the war was &quot;stupid and a real setback&quot;.

Hassan sent 11,000 troops, one infantry brigade to Egypt and one armored regiment to Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which six Moroccan troops were captured. During Hassan&#x27;s reign, Morocco recovered the Spanish-controlled area of Ifni in 1969, and gained control of two-thirds of what was formerly Spanish Sahara through the Green March in 1975. The nationalist Polisario Front subsequently engaged in a war for control of the territory, with support from Algeria, and relations between the two countries deteriorated further as a result.

=== Economy ===
Hassan adopted a market-based economy, where agriculture, tourism, and phosphates mining industries played a major role. In 1967, he launched an irrigation project consisting of over a million hectares of land.

The king eventually came to develop very good relations with parts of the French media and financial elite. In 1988, the contract for the construction of the Great Mosque of Casablanca, a considerable project in scale, financed through compulsory contributions, was awarded to a civil engineering firm owned by Francis Bouygues, one of the most powerful businessmen in France and a personal friend of Hassan&#x27;s. His image in France was tarnished, however, following the publication in 1990 of Gilles Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Our Friend the King&quot;, describing detention conditions in Tazmamart, the repression of left-wing opponents and Sahrawis, political assassinations, and the poor socioeconomic conditions in which the majority of Moroccans lived.

On 3 March 1973, Hassan announced a policy of &quot;Moroccanization&quot;, in which state-held assets, agricultural lands, and businesses that were more than fifty percent foreign-owned were taken over and transferred to local companies and businessmen. This economic policy affected thousands of businesses, and the proportion of locally-owned industrial businesses in Morocco immediately increased from 18% to 55%. Two-thirds of the wealth of the &quot;Moroccanized&quot; economy were concentrated in 36 Moroccan families.

In 1988, he also adopted a privatization policy. Beginning in 1993, more than a hundred public companies were privatized. It was primarily carried out by the king and his advisor, André Azoulay. Subsequently, the French group Accor was able to acquire six hotels from the Moroccan chain Moussafir and the management of the Jamaï Palace in Fez. This privatization operation enabled notables close to the Moroccan government to control the most prominent public companies, and French companies to make a strong comeback in the country&#x27;s economy. The royal family also acquired the mining group Monagem.

== Death and funeral ==

On 23 July 1999, Hassan was admitted to the CHU Ibn Sina Hospital in Rabat for acute interstitial pneumonitis; at 16:30 (GMT), he was pronounced dead from a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.

The Moroccan government ordered forty days of mourning, while entertainment and cultural events were cancelled, and public institutions and many businesses were closed upon news of the king&#x27;s death. Several world leaders expressed their condolences, and days of mourning were also declared in several other countries, the majority being Arab states. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Mohammed VI, whose enthronement ceremony was held a week later.

Hassan was buried on 25 July at the Mausoleum of Mohammed V in Rabat, following an Islamic funeral ceremony. His coffin, which was covered in a cloth depicting Islamic calligraphy, was carried by his two sons, King Mohammed VI and Prince Moulay Rachid.

==Personal life==

Hassan was described in an official royal palace biography after his death as &quot;well versed in the fields of architecture, medicine and technology&quot; and that he gave his children a &quot;strong commitment to the search for learning and a dedication to uphold the values of their country and their people&quot;. Hassan was fluent in Arabic and French and spoke &quot;capable English&quot;. He often quoted verse 29:46 (Al-Ankabut) of the Quran.

In 1956, then-prince Hassan began a relationship with French actress Etchika Choureau, whom he met in Cannes in 1956. The relationship ended in 1961 after Hassan&#x27;s ascension to the throne. Later that year, on 9 November, he married Lalla Latifa Amahzoune, an ethnic Zayane and a granddaughter of Berber chief Mouha ou Hammou Zayani, during a double nuptial ceremony with his brother Prince Moulay Abdallah. Hassan and Amahzoune had five children:

* Princess Lalla Meryem (born 26 August 1962);
* King Mohammed VI (born 21 August 1963);
* Princess Lalla Asma (born 29 September 1965);
* Princess Lalla Hasna (born 19 November 1967);
* Prince Moulay Rachid (born 20 June 1970).

<text>Timely Comics was the common name for the group of corporations that was the earliest comic book arm of American publisher Martin Goodman, and the entity that would evolve by the 1960s to become Marvel Comics.

Founded in 1939, during the era called the Golden Age of Comic Books, &quot;Timely&quot; was the umbrella name for the comics division of pulp magazine publisher Goodman, whose business strategy involved having a multitude of corporate entities all producing the same product. The company&#x27;s first publication in 1939 used Timely Publications, based at his existing company in the McGraw-Hill Building at 330 West 42nd Street in New York City. In 1942, it moved to the 14th floor of the Empire State Building, where it remained until 1951. In 2016, Marvel announced that Timely Comics would be the name of a new imprint of low-priced reprint comics.

==Creation==

In 1939, with the emerging medium of comic books proving hugely popular, and the first superheroes setting the trend, pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman founded Timely Publications, basing it at his existing company in the McGraw-Hill Building at 330 West 42nd Street in New York City. Goodman – whose official titles were editor, managing editor, and business manager, with Abraham Goodman officially listed as publisher – contracted with the newly formed comic book packager Funnies, Inc. to supply material.

His first effort, &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1 (Oct. 1939), featured the first appearances of writer-artist Carl Burgos&#x27; android superhero, the Human Torch, and Paul Gustavson&#x27;s costumed detective the Angel. It also contained the first published appearance of Bill Everett&#x27;s anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner, created for the unpublished movie-theater giveaway comic &quot;Motion Picture Funnies Weekly&quot; earlier that year, with the eight-page original story now expanded by four pages.

Also included were Al Anders&#x27; Western hero the Masked Raider; the jungle lord Ka-Zar the Great, with Ben Thompson beginning a five-issue adaptation of the story &quot;King of Fang and Claw&quot; by Bob Byrd in Goodman&#x27;s pulp magazine &quot;Ka-Zar&quot; #1 (Oct. 1936); the non-continuing-character story &quot;Jungle Terror&quot;, featuring adventurer Ken Masters, drawn and possibly written by Art Pinajian under the quirky pseudonym &quot;Tohm Dixon&quot; or &quot;Tomm Dixon&quot; (with the published signature smudged); &quot;Now I&#x27;ll Tell One&quot;, five single-panel, black-and-white gag cartoons by Fred Schwab, on the inside front cover; and a two-page prose story by Ray Gill, &quot;Burning Rubber&quot;, about auto racing. A painted cover by veteran science-fiction pulp artist Frank R. Paul featured the Human Torch, looking much different from the interior story.
That initial comic, cover-dated October 1939, quickly sold out 80,000 copies, prompting Goodman to produce a second printing, cover-dated November 1939. The latter is identical except for a black bar over the October date in the inside-front-cover indicia, and the November date added at the end. That sold approximately 800,000 copies. With a hit on his hands, Goodman began assembling an in-house staff, hiring Funnies, Inc. writer-artist Joe Simon as editor. Simon brought along his collaborator, artist Jack Kirby, followed by artist Syd Shores. Goodman then formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941.

There is evidence that &quot;Red Circle Comics&quot;, a name that would be used for an unrelated imprint of Archie Comics in the 1970s and 1980s – may have been a term in use as Goodman prepared to publish his first comic book. Historian Les Daniels, referring to Goodman&#x27;s pulp-magazine line, describes the name Red Circle as &quot;a halfhearted attempt to establish an identity for what was usually described loosely as &#x27;the Goodman group&#x27; [made] when a new logo was adopted: a red disk surrounded by a black ring that bore the phrase &#x27;A Red Circle Magazine.&#x27; But it appeared only intermittently, when someone remembered to put it on [a pulp magazine&#x27;s] cover. Historian Jess Nevins, conversely, writes that, &quot;Timely Publications [was how] Goodman&#x27;s group [of companies] had become known; before this, it was known as &#x27;Red Circle&#x27; because of the logo that Goodman had put on his pulp magazines...&quot; The Grand Comics Database identifies 23 issues of Goodman comic books from 1944 to 1959 with Red Circle, Inc. branding, and a single 1948 issue under Red Circle Magazines Corp.

==Golden Age of Comic Books==
&quot;Marvel Comics&quot; was rechristened &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; with issue #2 (Dec. 1939); the magazine would continue under that title through #92 (June 1949) before becoming &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; through #159 (Aug. 1957). Timely began publishing additional series, beginning with &quot;Daring Mystery Comics&quot; #1 (Jan. 1940), &quot;Mystic Comics&quot; #1 (March 1940), &quot;Red Raven Comics&quot; #1 (Aug. 1940), &quot;The Human Torch&quot; #2 (premiering Fall 1940 with no cover date and having taken over the numbering from the unsuccessful &quot;Red Raven&quot;), and &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #1 (March 1941). Going on sale in December 1940, a year before the bombing of Pearl Harbor and already showing the hero punching Hitler, that first issue sold nearly one million copies.

With the hit characters Human Torch and Sub-Mariner now joined by Simon and Kirby&#x27;s seminal patriotic hero Captain America, Timely had its &quot;big three&quot; stars of the era fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Rival publishers National Comics Publications / All-American Comics, the sister companies that would evolve into DC Comics, likewise had their own &quot;big three&quot;: Superman and Batman plus the soon-to-debut Wonder Woman. Timely&#x27;s other major competitors were Fawcett Publications (with Captain Marvel, introduced in 1940); Quality Comics (with Plastic Man and Blackhawk, both in 1941); and Lev Gleason Publications (with Daredevil, introduced in 1940 and unrelated to the 1960s Marvel hero).

Other Timely characters, many seen both in modern-day retroactive-continuity appearances and in flashbacks, include the Angel, the next-most-popular character in terms of number of appearances; the Destroyer, an early creation of future Marvel chief Stan Lee; super-speedster the Whizzer; the flying and super-strong Miss America; the original Vision, who inspired Marvel writer Roy Thomas in the 1960s to create a Silver Age version of the character; and the Blazing Skull and the Thin Man, two members of the present-day New Invaders.

Just as Captain America had his teenage sidekick Bucky and DC Comics&#x27; Batman had Robin, the Human Torch acquired a young partner, Toro, in the first issue of the Torch&#x27;s own magazine. The Young Allies—one of several &quot;kid gangs&quot; popular in comics at the time—debuted under the rubric the Sentinels of Liberty in a text story in &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #4 (June 1941) before making it to the comics pages themselves the following issue, and then eventually into their own title.

Seeing a natural &quot;fire and water&quot; theme, Timely was responsible for comic books&#x27; first major crossover, with a two-issue battle between the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner that spanned &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #8–9 (telling the story from the two characters&#x27; different perspectives).

After the Simon and Kirby team moved to DC late 1941, having produced &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; through issue #10 (Jan. 1942), Al Avison and Syd Shores became regular pencilers on the title, with one generally inking over the other. Stan Lee (né Stanley Lieber), a cousin of Goodman&#x27;s by marriage who had been serving as an assistant since 1939, at age 16, was promoted to interim editor just shy of his 19th birthday. Showing a knack for the business, Lee stayed on for decades, eventually becoming Marvel Comics&#x27; publisher in 1972. Fellow Timely staffer Vincent Fago would substitute during Lee&#x27;s World War II military service.

The staff at that time, Fago recalled, was, &quot;Mike Sekowsky. Ed Winiarski. Gary Keller was a production assistant and letterer. Ernest Hart and Kin Platt were writers, but they worked freelance; Hart also drew. George Klein, Syd Shores, Vince Alascia, Dave Gantz, and Chris Rule were there, too&quot;.

In 1942, Goodman moved his publisher operations to the 14th floor of the Empire State Building, where it remained until 1951.

==Funny animals, and people==
The superheroes were the products of what Timely referred to as the &quot;adventure&quot; bullpen. The company also developed an &quot;animator&quot; bullpen creating such movie tie-in and original talking animal comics as &quot;Terrytoons Comics&quot;, &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot;, &quot;All Surprise Comics&quot;, &quot;Super Rabbit Comics&quot;, &quot;Funny Frolics&quot;, and &quot;Funny Tunes,&quot; renamed &quot;Animated Funny Comic-Tunes&quot;. Former Fleischer Studios animator Fago, who joined Timely in 1942, headed this group, which consisted through the years of such writer/artists as Hart, Gantz, Klein, Platt, Rule, Sekowsky, Frank Carin (né Carino), Bob Deschamps, Chad Grothkopf, Pauline Loth, Jim Mooney, Moss Worthman a.k.a. Moe Worth, and future &quot;Mad&quot; magazine cartoonists Dave Berg and Al Jaffee.

Features from this department include &quot;Dinky&quot; and &quot;Frenchy Rabbit&quot; in &quot;Terrytoons Comics&quot;; &quot;Floop and Skilly Boo&quot; in &quot;Comedy Comics&quot;; &quot;Posty the Pelican Postman&quot; in &quot;Krazy Komics&quot; and other titles; &quot;Krazy Krow&quot; in that character&#x27;s eponymous comic; &quot;Tubby an&#x27; Tack&quot;, in various comics; and the most popular of these features, Jaffee&#x27;s &quot;Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal&quot; and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Super Rabbit&quot;, the cover stars of many different titles. Timely also published one of humor cartoonist Basil Wolverton&#x27;s best-known features, &quot;Powerhouse Pepper&quot;. The first issue, cover-dated January 1943, bore no number, and protagonist Pepper looked different from his more familiar visualization (when the series returned for four issues, May–Nov. 1948) as the bullet-headed naif in the striped turtleneck sweater.

Additionally, Timely in 1944 and 1945 initiated a sitcom selection of titles aimed at female readers: &quot;Millie the Model&quot;, &quot;Tessie the Typist&quot; and &quot;Nellie the Nurse&quot;. The company continued to pursue female readers later in the decade with such superheroines as Sun Girl; the Sub-Mariner spin-off Namora; and Venus, the Roman goddess of love, posing as a human reporter. &quot;Patsy Walker&quot;, &quot;Millie the Model&quot;, &quot;Tessie the Typist&quot; and other Timely humor titles also included Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Hey Look!&quot; one-pagers in several issues.

Future Comic Book Hall of Fame artist Gene Colan, a Marvel mainstay from 1946 on, recalled that, &quot;The atmosphere at Timely was very good, very funny. ... [I worked in] a big art room and there were about 20 artists in there, all stacked up. Syd [Shores] was in the last row on my side, and there was another row on the other side. Dan DeCarlo was there, several other people – Vince Alascia was an inker; Rudy LaPick sat right behind me,&quot; with Mike Sekowsky &quot;in another room&quot;.

Yet after the wartime boom years – when superheroes had been new and inspirational, and comics provided cheap entertainment for millions of children, soldiers and others – the post-war era found superheroes falling out of fashion. Television and mass market paperback books now also competed for readers and leisure time. Goodman began turning to a wider variety of genres than ever, emphasizing horror, Westerns, teen humor, crime and war comics, and introducing female heroes to try to attract girls and young women to read comics. In 1946, for instance, the superhero title &quot;All Select Comics&quot; was changed to &quot;Blonde Phantom Comics&quot;, and now starred a masked secretary who fought crime in an evening gown. That same year, &quot;Kid Komics&quot; eliminated its stars and became &quot;Kid Movie Comics&quot;. &quot;All Winners Comics&quot; became &quot;All Teen Comics&quot; in January 1947. Timely eliminated virtually all its staff positions in 1948.

==Time after Timely==
The precise end-point of the Golden Age of comics is vague, but for Timely, at least, it appears to have ended with the cancellation of &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; at issue #75 (Feb. 1950) – by which time the series had already been &quot;Captain America&#x27;s Weird Tales&quot; for two issues, with the finale featuring merely anthological horror/suspense tales and no superheroes. &quot;Sub-Mariner Comics&quot; and &quot;Human Torch Comics&quot; had already ended with #32 (June 1949) and #35 (March 1949) respectively, and the company&#x27;s flagship title, &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot;, starring the Angel, ended that same month with #92, becoming the horror anthology &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; beginning with issue #93 (Aug. 1949). Goodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company, the newsstand-distribution company he owned, on comics cover-dated Nov. 1951.

In 2015, Marvel registered the trademark &quot;Timely Comics&quot;. The following year, Marvel announced that Timely Comics would be the name of a new imprint of low-priced reprint comics.

==Marvel branding==
Publisher Martin Goodman&#x27;s business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of companies all operating out of the same office and with the same staff. One of these shell companies under which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #55 (May 1944). As well, some comics&#x27; covers, such as &quot;All Surprise Comics&quot; #12 (Winter 1946–47), were labeled &quot;A Marvel Magazine&quot; many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961. This brand extended to the company&#x27;s short-lived editorial advisory board in 1948 in an effort to compete with other publishers like DC Comics and Fawcett Comics, and used the moniker Marvel Comic Group in its editorials.

<doc id="410362" wikidata="Q310883" url="?curid=410362" title="André Kolingba">
<text>André-Dieudonné Kolingba (12 August 1936 – 7 February 2010) was a Central African politician, who was the fourth President of the Central African Republic (CAR), from 1 September 1981 until 1 October 1993. He took power from President David Dacko in a bloodless coup d&#x27;état in 1981 and lost power to Ange-Félix Patassé in a democratic election held in 1993. Kolingba retained the strong support of France until the end of the Cold War in 1992, after which both internal and external pressure forced him to hold presidential elections which he lost.

His twelve-year term in office saw the growing influence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in decisions by donor-nations regarding financial support and management of the Central African state. Many members of Kolingba&#x27;s ethnic group, the Yakoma people, obtained lucrative posts in the public, private and parastatal sectors of the CAR&#x27;s economy during his era. This gave rise to growing tension between so-called &quot;southerners&quot; (including the riverine Yakoma) and &quot;northerners&quot; (including the savanna Gbaya) in the CAR which led to violent confrontations between these groups during the Patassé era (1993–2003).

In 2001, Kolingba took part in a failed coup attempt against Patassé, after which he temporarily fled to Uganda to evade trial.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
André-Dieudonné Kolingba was born on 12 August 1936 in Bangui, the capital of the French colony of Oubangui-Chari in French Equatorial Africa. A member of the riverine Yakoma ethnic group, Kolingba (meaning &quot;male Buffalo&quot;) joined the French military in 1954 and received military training at the &quot;École de formation des officiers ressortissants des territoires d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; (EFORTOM) at Fréjus. He was transferred to the Central African army at independence in 1960. As a military officer, he also worked at Radio Bangui, where he became a host at the magazine of the Central African Armed Forces and a classical music program and later was promoted to co-director. While working at the radio, he met his future wife, Mireille Kotalimbora.

He became a sub-lieutenant on 1 October 1964, a colonel, and then a brigadier general on 3 April 1973. As a battalion commander, he was named technical adviser to the minister of national defense, veterans and war victims on 1 March 1977, as well as aide-de-camp of Bokassa. He then served briefly as the CAR&#x27;s ambassador to Canada — replacing Sylvestre Bangui — and the Federal Republic of Germany before being named minister in March 1979. When Bokassa was overthrown in 1979 and David Dacko was restored to power by the French, general Kolingba gained Dacko&#x27;s favor and was made army chief of staff in July 1981.

===Overthrow of David Dacko===
In September 1981, general Kolingba overthrew Dacko in a coup d&#x27;état. There has been considerable speculation about who supported Kolingba&#x27;s seizure of power. It has been suggested that local French military advisers helped him carry out the coup without the authorization or knowledge of Socialist President François Mitterrand and his entourage (Delayan 1985; Kalck 2004). Central African Republic specialists Richard Bradshaw and Carlos Fandos-Rius also state that Kolingba &quot;seized power with French support&quot;. According to historian Brian Titley, the 800 French soldiers in the country had orders not to interfere. In 1991, DGSE head Pierre Marion admitted that the French military advisor had played a role in the coup.

The French went on to support Kolingba until the fall of the Berlin Wall and the democratization movement in Africa during the late 1980s and early 1990s led to local, French and international pressure to hold presidential elections.

===Ruling years===
After overthrowing Dacko in 1981, Kolingba established a military committee for national reconstruction to rule the country, but in fact he ruled as a military dictator, more corrupt than brutal, until 1986, when he submitted a Constitution to a national referendum. The document was approved with an implausible total of 92 percent. Under its terms, Kolingba was automatically elected president for a six-year term. It also established the Central African Democratic Rally &quot;(Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain&quot;, RDC) as the country&#x27;s only legal party. Parliamentary elections were held in 1987, in which voters were presented with a single list of RDC candidates. With all candidates effectively handpicked by Kolingba, he effectively held complete political control over the country. His regime kept political opponents, for example Abel Goumba, under close surveillance and excluded them from formal politics.

Kolingba&#x27;s government favored fellow Yakoma to hold important administrative, financial and military posts. This led to the majority of key positions being taken up by Yakoma people. Although disproportionate Yakoma influence already dated back to the colonial era when they worked for Europeans and had access to French education, Amnesty International has stated that &quot;nepotism became institutionalized&quot; under Kolingba. His years in office further saw the return of Jean-Bédel Bokassa to the Central African Republic. After the latter was tried and sentenced to death in 1987, Kolingba decided to commute this to a life sentence in 1988.

With regards to international politics, the country&#x27;s existing ties with France were maintained or even strengthened. Jean-Claude Mantion, the SDECE and DGSE officer who was implied in the 1981 coup by Marion, had been installed at the head of the Presidential Guard under Dacko shortly before the coup took place. Mantion maintained this position throughout the entirety of the Kolingba era. This led him to be described as a &quot;proconsul&quot; and as &quot;the president of President Kolingba&quot;, implying he was even more powerful than Kolingba himself.

The repression of opposition under the Kolingba regime backfired: by 1990, the opposition had united in an alliance, the &quot;Comité de coordination pour la convocation d’une conférence nationale&quot; (CCCCN). Internal and external pressures gradually forced Kolingba to open up the regime. In March 1991 he agreed to share power with Edouard Frank, who he named prime minister. He also established a commission to make the constitution more democratic and pluralistic. In late 1991, the donor community (most notably a very vocal US ambassador and elements in the French government) finally pressured Kolingba to hold free elections. These took place in 1992, assisted by the UN Electoral Assistance Unit and monitored by international observers. Kolingba finished last, with only 10 percent of the vote. In response, he had the constitutional council declare the election invalid.

Kolingba&#x27;s presidential mandate was due to expire on 28 November 1992, but he carried out a &quot;constitutional coup d&#x27;état&quot; which extended his presidential term for another 90 days. At multiple occasions throughout 1992, the government took violent action against protesters and carried out extrajudicial executions. These included the beating to death of ADP politician Jean-Claude Conjugo and the killing of a pregnant woman (Hermine Yakite) on her way to hospital to give birth after she resisted attempts to commandeer her car.

===Election of Patassé===

On 3 February 1993, Kolingba established an interim organ, the National Provisional Political Council of the Republic (Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République). On 28 February 1993, Goumba, by now leader of the opposition Democratic Forces for Dialogue (Concertation des Forces Démocratiques), announced President Kolingba was no longer president. Unwilling to give in, Kolingba remained in his post but the group of local donor representatives (GIBAFOR), notably from the USA and France, forced him to hold proper elections. The same team which the UN Electoral Assistance unit had provided for the earlier election, and which Kolingba&#x27;s government caused to fail, was brought in to give its support. Kolingba came in fourth, with only 12 percent of the vote - well short of a spot in the runoff. Ange Patassé won the presidency in the second round on 19 September 1993. When Kolingba turned over the presidency to Patassé a month later, it marked the first (and to date only) time since independence when an incumbent president peacefully surrendered power to the opposition.

===Involvement in 2001 coup attempt===
On the night of 27-28 May 2001, a coup attempt against President Patassé took place, but failed. Two days later, Kolingba claimed responsibility for the attempted coup through Radio France Internationale and demanded that Patassé &quot;resign and hand over power to him&quot;. Patassé reacted by demoting Kolingba and four other officers to the rank of private. On June 1, Kolingba called on the other coup plotters to lay down arms and attempted to negotiate with Patassé, which the latter refused. Shortly afterwards, weapons were found in Kolingba&#x27;s residence.

Kolingba fled to Kampala, Uganda, to evade trial. He was found guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Central African criminal court and sentenced to death. 21 of Kolingba&#x27;s associates, including 3 of his sons, also received a death sentence.

===Final years and death===
Patassé was overthrown in a March 2003 coup by François Bozizé, who declared an amnesty for all those involved in the 2001 coup attempt. Kolingba finally returned to Bangui on 5 October 2003 during the last days of a National Conference (&quot;Dialogue National&quot;) which Bozizé sponsored to promote reconciliation and reconstruction of the country. On 7 October 2003, Kolingba attended the conference and spoke to the delegates, publicly apologizing for the excesses committed during his rule as well as his role in the 2001 coup attempt. He then left for Paris on 2 November 2003 for a prostate operation. Kolingba died in Paris on 7 February 2010.

==Awards and family==
Kolingba married Mireille Kotalimbora-Kolingba in 1969, and the couple had twelve children.

Kolingba was named officier de l&#x27;Ordre de l&#x27;Opération Bokassa (Officer of the Order of the Operation Bokassa) on 1 December 1971, officier de l&#x27;Ordre de la Médaille de la Reconnaissance Centrafricaine (Officer of the Order of the Medal of Central African Gratitude) on 1 January 1972, chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre du Merite Postal (Knight of the Order of Postal Merit) on 1 December 1972, commandeur (Commander) (1 January 1975) and dignité de Grand-Croix (Grand Cross) (1 December 1981) de l&#x27;Ordre du Mérite Centrafricain (Central African Order of Merit).

<doc id="410365" wikidata="Q1264581" url="?curid=410365" title="Duke of Queensberry">
<text>The title Duke of Queensberry was created in the Peerage of Scotland on 3 February 1684 along with the subsidiary title Marquess of Dumfriesshire for the 1st Marquess of Queensberry. The Dukedom was held along with the Marquessate of Queensberry until the death of the 4th Duke (and 5th Marquess) in 1810, when the Marquessate was inherited by Sir Charles Douglas of Kelhead, 5th Baronet, while the Dukedom was inherited by the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. Since then the title of Duke of Queensberry has been held by the Dukes of Buccleuch.

In 1708, the 2nd Duke was created Duke of Dover (along with the subsidiary titles Marquess of Beverley and Baron Ripon) in the Peerage of Great Britain, but these titles became extinct upon the death of the 2nd Duke of Dover in 1778. In 1945, King George VI offered Winston Churchill the title of &quot;Duke of Dover&quot;, which he declined.

Several subsidiary titles are associated with the Dukedom of Queensberry, namely Marquess of Dumfriesshire (1683), Earl of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar (1682), Viscount of Nith, Tortholwald and Ross (1682) and Lord Douglas of Kilmount, Middlebie and Dornock (1682) (all in the Peerage of Scotland).

The seat of the Dukes is at Drumlanrig Castle, built by the 1st Duke of Queensberry.

<text>MAX Comics is an imprint of Marvel Comics specializing in comic book media aimed at adult-only readers. It was launched in 2001 after Marvel broke with the Comics Code Authority and established its own rating system.

==History==
The MAX Comics imprint is not Marvel&#x27;s first effort to feature explicit content in their titles. The company&#x27;s Epic Comics imprint in the 1980s and early 1990s often featured stronger content than their mainstream imprint. However, the MAX Comics imprint is the first time Marvel has specifically produced comics with uncensored content. 

The first series to be published under the Max imprint was &quot;Alias&quot;, written by Brian Michael Bendis. Several limited series were then created specially for the Max imprint, such as &quot;Apache Skies&quot; and &quot;Haunt of Horror&quot;, but the majority of its publications were based around existing Marvel characters, such as Howard the Duck and Devil-Slayer.

One Marvel character who was revived by Max was &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot; who in 2002 became the first openly homosexual Marvel comic book character to star in his own magazine. The first edition of the Rawhide Kid&#x27;s saga was called &quot;Slap Leather&quot;. According to a CNN.com article, &quot;The new series pairs the original artist, John Severin, now 86, with Ron Zimmerman, a television writer. Making the Rawhide Kid gay was Zimmerman&#x27;s idea.&quot; The character&#x27;s homosexuality is conveyed indirectly, through euphemisms and puns, and the comic&#x27;s style is campy. Conservative groups protested the homosexual take on the character, which they claimed would corrupt children, though the covers carried an &quot;Adults only&quot; label.

Since 2012, the new works under the MAX imprint have been limited to the Punisher series. Marvel now portrays MAX as a rating indicating mature content, rather than a separate brand. The latest MAX issue (&quot;Get Fury&quot; #6) was published in October 2024 (cover date).

==Criticism==
While some works such as &quot;Alias&quot; have received acclaim, the imprint has attracted controversy, with some critics considering some of the titles to be gratuitous in its use of mature or vulgar content. Former Marvel president and chairman Stan Lee openly criticized the Max imprint. Referring to an incident of strangulation with intestines in the 2001 &quot;Fury&quot; miniseries, based on the character Nick Fury, whom he co-created, Lee said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re doing that. I don&#x27;t think that I would do those kinds of stories&quot;.

<text>Charles Bernard Rangel ( ; born June 11, 1930) is an American politician who was a U.S. representative for districts in New York City for 46 years. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the second-longest serving incumbent member of the House of Representatives at the time of his retirement in 2017, having served continuously since 1971. As its most senior member, he was also the Dean of New York&#x27;s congressional delegation. Rangel was the first African American chair of the influential House Ways and Means Committee. He was also a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Rangel was born in Harlem in Upper Manhattan. He earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for his service in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, where he led a group of soldiers out of a deadly Chinese Army encirclement during the Battle of Kunu-ri in 1950. Rangel graduated from New York University in 1957 and St. John&#x27;s University School of Law in 1960. He worked as a private lawyer, assistant U.S. attorney, and legal counsel during the early-mid-1960s. He served two terms in the New York State Assembly from 1967 to 1971 and defeated long-time incumbent Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. in a primary challenge on his way to being elected to the House of Representatives.

Rangel rose rapidly in the Democratic ranks in the House, combining solidly liberal views with a pragmatic style that allowed him to find political and legislative compromises. His long-time concern with the importation and effects of illegal drugs led to his becoming chair of the House Select Committee on Narcotics, where he helped define national policy on the issue during the 1980s. As one of Harlem&#x27;s &quot;Gang of Four&quot;, he also became a leader in New York City and State politics. Rangel played a significant role in the creation of the 1995 Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation and the national Empowerment Zone Act. Rangel is known both for his genial manner and for his blunt speaking; he has long been outspoken about his views and has been arrested several times as part of political demonstrations. He was a strong opponent of the George W. Bush administration and the Iraq War, and he put forth proposals to reinstate the draft during the 2000s. As his district became more Hispanic, Rangel faced two strong primary challengers during the 2012 and 2014 elections, but he nonetheless prevailed. He did not run for re-election in 2016 and left office in January 2017.

Beginning in 2008, Rangel faced allegations that he had violated House ethics rules and failed to abide by tax laws. The House Ethics Committee considered whether Rangel improperly rented multiple rent-stabilized New York apartments, improperly used his office in raising money for the Rangel Center at the City College of New York, and failed to disclose rental income from his villa in the Dominican Republic. In March 2010, Rangel stepped aside as the Ways and Means chair. In November 2010, the Ethics Committee found Rangel guilty of 11 counts of violating House ethics rules, and on December 2, 2010, the full House approved a sanction of censure against him. 
==Early life, military service, and education==
Rangel was born in Harlem in New York City on June 11, 1930. His father, Ralph Rangel, was from Puerto Rico and came to New York in 1914, while his African American mother, Blanche Mary Wharton Rangel, was from New York City and had family roots in Virginia. Charles was the second of three children, with an older brother Ralph Jr. and a younger sister Frances. Ralph Rangel sometimes worked as a laborer in a garage, but he was mostly a frequently absent, unemployed man who was abusive to his wife and who left the family when Charles was six years old. Charles was raised by his mother, who worked as a maid and as a seamstress in a factory in New York&#x27;s Garment District, and by his maternal grandfather. Many summers were spent in Accomac, Virginia where his maternal family had roots. Charles was brought up as a Catholic.

Rangel did well in elementary and middle school, and he began working at a neighborhood drug store at the age of eight. Rangel attended DeWitt Clinton High School, but he was often truant and was sometimes driven home by the police. His maternal grandfather, an early role model who worked in a courthouse and knew many judges and lawyers, kept him from getting into more serious trouble. Rangel dropped out at age 16 during his junior year and worked in various low-paying jobs including selling shoes.

Rangel then enlisted in the United States Army and served from 1948 to 1952. During the Korean War he was an artillery operations specialist in the all-black 503rd Field Artillery Battalion in the 2nd Infantry Division, and equipped with the 155 mm Howitzer M1. (While President Harry S. Truman had signed the order to desegregate the military in 1948, little progress in doing so had been made during peacetime, and the large majority of units initially sent to Korea were still segregated.) Rangel&#x27;s unit arrived in Pusan, South Korea in August 1950 and began moving north as U.N. forces advanced deep into North Korea.
In late November 1950, after the Chinese intervention into the war his unit was caught in heavy fighting in North Korea as part of the U.N. forces retreat from the Yalu River. In the Battle of Kunu-ri, the 2nd Infantry was assigned to hold a road position near Kunu-ri while the rest of the Eighth Army retreated to Sunchon, 21 miles further south. On the night of November 29, the 2nd Infantry was attacked by gradually encircling forces of the Chinese Army, who set up a fireblock to cut off any U.S. retreat. The eerie blare of Chinese night-fighting bugle calls and communication flares piercing the freezing air led to what Rangel later described as a &quot;waking nightmare, scene by scene, and we couldn&#x27;t see any possible way out of the situation&quot;. During the day on November 30, the order came to withdraw the 2nd Infantry in phases, but the 503rd Artillery Battalion was sixth of eight in the order and could not get out in daylight when air cover was possible.

On the night of November 30, Rangel was part of a retreating vehicle column that was trapped and attacked by Chinese forces. In the subzero cold Rangel was hit in the back by shrapnel from a Chinese shell. He later wrote that the blast threw him into a ditch, causing him to pray fervently to Jesus. Up and down the line of the retreat, unit cohesion disappeared under attack and officers lost contact with their men. There was screaming and moaning around him and some U.S. soldiers were being taken prisoner, but despite feeling overwhelming fear Rangel resolved to try to escape over an imposing mountain: &quot;From the rim of that gully it just looked like everything had to be better on the other side of that damn mountain.&quot;

Others nearby looked to Rangel, who though only a private first class had a reputation for leadership in the unit and had gained the nickname &quot;Sarge&quot;. Rangel led some 40 men from his unit over the mountain during the night and out of the Chinese encirclement. Other groups were trying to do the same, but some men dropped from the severe conditions or got lost and were never heard from again. By midday on December 1, U.S. aircraft were dropping supplies and directions to Rangel&#x27;s group and others, and had a raft ready to take them across the Taedong River; groups from the 503rd Artillery reached Sunchon that afternoon. Overall, no part of the 2nd Infantry suffered as many casualties as the artillery; it tried to save, but eventually lost, all its guns, and nearly half of the battalion was killed in the overall battle.

Rangel was treated first at a field hospital, then moved to a general hospital well behind the lines in South Korea where he recuperated. He eventually returned to regular duty, then was rotated back to the U.S. in July 1951.

Rangel was awarded a Purple Heart for his wounds, the Bronze Star with Valor for his actions in the face of death, and three battle stars. His Army unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. In 2000, Rangel reflected on the experience in a CBS News interview:

After an honorable discharge from the Army in 1952 with the rank of staff sergeant, he returned home to headlines in &quot;The New York Amsterdam News&quot;.
Rangel later viewed his time in the Army, away from the poverty of his youth, as a major turning point in his life: &quot;When I was exposed to a different life, even if that life was just the Army, I knew damn well I couldn&#x27;t get back to the same life I had left.&quot;

Rangel finished high school, completing two years of studies in one year. Benefiting from the G.I. Bill Rangel received a Bachelor of Science degree from the New York University School of Commerce in 1957, where he made the dean&#x27;s list. On full scholarship, he obtained his law degree from the St. John&#x27;s University School of Law in 1960.

Rangel is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He is also a member of the fraternity&#x27;s World Policy Council, a think tank whose purpose is to expand Alpha Phi Alpha&#x27;s involvement in politics and social and current policy to encompass international concerns.

==Early career==

===Legal===
After finishing law school Rangel passed the state bar exam and was hired by Weaver, Evans &amp; Wingate, a prominent black law firm. Rangel made little money in private practice, but did build a positive reputation for providing legal assistance to black civil rights activists. In 1961, Rangel was appointed Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York by U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and worked under U.S. Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau. He stayed in the position for a year.

Next Rangel was legal counsel to the New York Housing and Redevelopment Board, associate counsel to the Speaker of the New York State Assembly, a law clerk to pioneering Judge James L. Watson, and general counsel to the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service (1966), a presidential commission created to revise draft laws. His interest in politics grew.

Rangel met Alma Carter, a social worker, in the mid-late-1950s while on the dance floor of the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. They married on July 26, 1964. They have two children, Steven and Alicia, and three grandsons.

===Political===
He ran for party district leader and lost during an intense Democratic factional dispute in Harlem in 1963. In 1964, Rangel and the man who would become his political mentor, Assemblyman Percy Sutton, merged clubs as part of forming the John F. Kennedy Democratic Club in Harlem (which later became part of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Democratic Club).

Rangel participated in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches, marching for four days even though he had planned only a brief appearance. He developed what &quot;The New York Times&quot; would label his irrepressible energy and joking style of self-mockery during this time.

Rangel was selected in September 1966 by Harlem Democrats to run in the 72nd District for the New York State Assembly, after the incumbent Percy Sutton had been elected by the New York City Council members from Manhattan as Manhattan Borough President to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Constance Baker Motley as a federal judge. Rangel was victorious, serving in the 177th and 178th New York State Legislatures until 1970. He emerged as a leader among the black legislators in the state and became politically friendly with Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller, who arranged for Rangel to run on the Republican as well as Democratic ballot line during his 1968 re-election.

Rangel supported legalization of the numbers game, saying &quot;For the average Harlemite, playing numbers... is moral and a way of life.&quot; He also opposed harsher penalties on prostitutes, on grounds of ineffectiveness. He was strongly concerned by the effects of drugs on Harlem, advocated that drug pushers be held accountable for the crimes committed by their users, and in general believed the problem was at the level of a threat to national security.

In 1969, Rangel ran for the Democratic nomination for New York City Council President. In a tumultuous race that featured sportswriter Jimmy Breslin as mayoral candidate Norman Mailer&#x27;s running mate, Rangel came in last in a field of six candidates.

In 1970, Rangel ran for election to the U.S. House of Representatives, challenging long-time incumbent Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr., in the Democratic primary in New York&#x27;s 18th congressional district. Powell had been an iconic, charismatic, and flamboyant figure who had become embroiled in an ethics controversy in 1967, lost his seat, and then regained it in 1969 due to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Powell v. McCormack&quot;. In a field with five candidates Rangel focused on criticizing Powell&#x27;s frequent absences from Congress. In the June primary Rangel defeated Powell by 150 votes out of around 25,000 cast. Powell tried to take legal action to overturn the result claiming over 1,000 ballots were improper votes but was unsuccessful. Powell also failed to get on the ballot as an independent. With both Democratic and Republican backing, Rangel won the November 1970 general election–against a Liberal Party candidate and several others–with 88 percent of the vote.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Districts, terms, and committees===

Initially the strongest electoral challenge to Rangel came during his first re-election bid, in 1972, when he faced a Democratic primary challenge from HARYOU-ACT director Livingston Wingate, who had the backing of the old Powell organization and the Congress of Racial Equality, a black nationalist group that Rangel publicly denounced. Rangel had the backing of the other Democratic power bases, however, and won the primary by a 3–to–1 margin and the general election easily.

Rangel won re-election every two years until his retirement, usually with over 90 percent of the vote and often with more than 95 percent. In a number of elections Rangel received the backing of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the Liberal Party of New York. Rangel&#x27;s consistent appeal to his constituents has been due to the perception of him as a champion for justice not just in Harlem but elsewhere in the world. He did face a mid-career primary challenge in 1994 when two-term New York City Councilman Adam Clayton Powell IV was his opponent and held Rangel to 58 percent of the vote. Rangel then faced strong primary challenges from 2010 on during and after his ethics troubles.
His district was numbered the Eighteenth District from 1971 to 1973; the Nineteenth District from 1973 to 1983; the Sixteenth District from 1983 to 1993; and the Fifteenth from 1993 to 2013. Early 1970s&#x27; reapportionment led to the area that Rangel represented being only 65 percent black, and by 1979 it was 50 percent non-Hispanic black, 30 percent white, and 20 percent Puerto Rican. By 2000, only 3 in 10 district residents were non-Hispanic blacks, while nearly half were Hispanic, with many of the newcomers being Dominican. Subsequently, numbered the Thirteenth, Rangel&#x27;s area of representation showed a 2-to-1 preponderance of Hispanics over non-Hispanic African Americans.

Rangel was an original member when the Congressional Black Caucus was formed in 1971. In 1974, he was elected its chairman and he served in that role until 1976. He remained a member of the caucus for the duration of his time in office.

===1970s: Rapid rise===

As a freshman representative Rangel focused on the issue of drugs and was a member of the House Select Committee on Crime. In February 1971, he criticized the Nixon administration for not taking stronger action against Turkey and France, the source and manufacture points for most of the heroin coming into the U.S. His proposal to halt foreign aid to countries not cooperating in the effort against international drug trafficking was unsuccessful, but led to a bill authorizing the president to reduce aid to those countries. Rangel created controversy in New York City by accusing some members of the New York Police Department of cooperating with drug pushers.

On April 14, 1972, Rangel and Louis Farrakhan interfered in the investigation of the murder of New York Police Department patrolman Philip Cardillo, who was fatally shot in a Harlem Nation of Islam mosque where Malcolm X used to preach. Before a suspect could be taken into custody, Farrakhan and Rangel arrived at the scene, saying a riot would likely occur if the suspect and others were not released. Some police department officials also limited the investigation, including deputy commissioner for public affairs Benjamin Ward, who had ordered all white officers away from the scene in acquiescing to the demands of Farrakhan and Rangel.

Despite an initial impression that Rangel was mostly concerned with the &quot;ghetto problems&quot; of drugs and welfare, Rangel focused on many other issues. He consistently backed Israel, including objecting to an anti-Israeli resolution adopted at the National Black Political Convention in 1972 and urging black Americans to support the civil rights of Soviet Jews in 1975. In other respects Rangel opposed foreign interventions and military spending, voting against bombing in Cambodia, and against funding for the B-1 bomber and supercarriers.

In Congress one of Rangel&#x27;s first committee assignments was on the House Judiciary Committee; during the Watergate scandal he participated in the 1974 impeachment process against Richard Nixon. Rangel received both national attention and respect for his well-informed questioning style during the hearings. Rangel was also prominent in questioning Governor Rockefeller on his role in handling the Attica Prison riot during Rockefeller&#x27;s vice presidential confirmation hearing.

Rangel rose rapidly in the House, due to his political skills, hard work, knowledge of legislative matters, and genial manner. In 1974, he became the first African American ever named to the House Committee on Ways and Means, a position he assumed in 1975 (and left the Judiciary Committee) and by 1979 had become the chairman of its important Subcommittee on Health. In 1976, he was named to the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. By 1979, he was a member of the influential House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. He combined his solidly liberal views–interest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegation–with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican Guy Vander Jagt on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the Carter administration. In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on natural gas deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem. Rangel said of himself, &quot;I guess I&#x27;m practical, but you have to live with yourself and make sure you are not so practical that you sell out a part of yourself.&quot;

Besides his increasing influence in Washington, by the late 1970s Rangel was New York City&#x27;s leading black political figure. After initially endorsing Percy Sutton in the 1977 mayoral election, he endorsed Ed Koch over Mario Cuomo in the Democratic primary run-off. He attempted to mediate between Mayor Koch and some minority groups who thought the Koch administration racially insensitive. As Koch related, &quot;He has told some blacks angry with me: &#x27;You say Ed Koch is nasty to you? I want you to know he&#x27;s nasty to everybody.&#x27; I thought that was rather nice.&quot;

===1980s: Influential figure===

In 1981, Rangel became chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight giving him power in attempting to oppose the Reagan administration&#x27;s cuts in social spending. By 1983 he was the third-ranking member on Ways and Means, and worked well with its powerful chairman, Dan Rostenkowski. Rangel became a protégé of Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill who made him Deputy Majority Whip later that year. In the 1984 United States presidential election, Rangel supported former Vice President Walter Mondale rather than the primary campaign of Jesse Jackson.

By that time Rangel was known as one of the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;, who along with his old mentor Percy Sutton, city and state figure Basil A. Paterson, and future mayor David Dinkins were the most prominent politicians in Harlem. They broke racial barriers, attained offices once viewed as not possible for black Americans to achieve, and paved the way for many others around the nation. As power brokers they would dominate public life in Harlem for a generation.

Rangel endorsed Koch for re-election in 1981; by 1983 his relationship with the mayor had fallen apart: &quot;I don&#x27;t know anybody in politics that I dislike enough that I would recommend that he sit down with the mayor.&quot; By 1984 Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless. Rangel was one of the city&#x27;s most recognizable politicians and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best case even House Speaker. Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.

In 1983, Rangel became chair of the Select Committee on Narcotics solidifying his position as a leading strategist on an issue perennially important to him. Rangel kept the committee going in the face of usual pressure to disband special committees. He battled against proposed cutbacks in the federal anti-drug budget, advocating for increased grants to states and cities for better shelters for the homeless. Rangel&#x27;s amendments providing increased funding for state and local law enforcement and were included in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. He traveled to countries in Central and South America and other places to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine termed Rangel &quot;a front-line general in the war against drugs.&quot; Rangel said &quot;We need outrage!&quot;, making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics of crack cocaine, heroin, PCP, and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s. He believed that legalizing drugs would represent &quot;moral and political suicide&quot;. He did not refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers had no sense of self-preservation, and that drug dealers were so stupid they had to eat in fast-food places because they could not read a menu. By 1988, Rangel was saying that President Ronald Reagan had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady Nancy Reagan&#x27;s &quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign had been quite valuable. The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said Rangel was &quot;in a powerful position to shape policy on an issue at the top of the nation&#x27;s agenda&quot;. He would remain as chair of the committee through 1993, when it was abolished along with other House select committees.
Rangel was part of the House–Senate joint conference that worked on the Tax Reform Act of 1986, a simplifying overhaul that constituted the most sweeping reform of the U.S. tax code in 50 years. In the negotiations Rangel successfully argued for dropping more lower-income people from the tax rolls; the elimination of six million households from federal income taxation was hailed as a wise policy by both liberal and conservative groups. Rangel authored the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit portion of the bill, which increased affordable housing in the U.S. He also played a key role in preserving the deductibility of state and local income taxes. He asserted that while beneficiaries of tax reform were not well organized, business interests opposed to it were. When the conference threatened to break down, he stressed it was vital to reach an agreement.

By late 1985 Rangel was in a six-person race to become the next House Majority Whip, the third-highest ranked position in the House and for the first time up for election by the members rather than appointment by the Speaker. In October 1986 the race was heating up, with Rangel as the underdog coming close to Representative Tony Coelho from California through use of his personal skills and Rangel arguing that the Democratic leadership needed better regional balance. However, in December 1986, Coelho defeated Rangel in the vote for whip, 167–78. Rangel attributed his loss to Coelho having funded the campaigns of many House members via his role as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, later saying, &quot;I had never been so goddamn naive. I came to Washington as an experienced politician. How did I miss Coelho&#x27;s contribution to members?&quot;

In December 1984, Rangel was arrested for participating in an anti-apartheid rally in front of the South African Consulate in New York. Rangel successfully pushed to have foreign tax credits removed for corporations doing business in that country, a 1987 act that became known as the &quot;Rangel Amendment&quot;. A number of companies left South Africa as a result, and the amendment proved to be one of the more effective anti-apartheid sanctions. The bill won praise from Nelson Mandela and Rangel later said was one of his actions that he was most proud of.

===1990s: Support and opposition===
During the 1991 Gulf War, Rangel demanded that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell investigate allegations of discrimination from black members of the New York Army National Guard regarding combat training and treatment. During the Clinton administration, Rangel battled with executive branch officials over budget items almost as much as he had during Republican administrations, and always resented when Clinton negotiated directly with Republicans while bypassing congressional Democrats. In 1993, however, Rangel was a key sponsor of increases to the Earned Income Tax Credit that passed.

Rangel&#x27;s dream of becoming chairman of Ways and Means took a tumble with the Republican Revolution of 1994, which took control of the House away from the Democrats for the first time in decades. He did become the ranking Democrat of the committee in 1996. Rangel was bitterly opposed to the Republican Contract With America, considering it an assault on America&#x27;s poor, and strongly criticized Democrats such as President Bill Clinton and religious leaders such as John Cardinal O&#x27;Connor for perpetuating &quot;the silence of good people&quot; that he likened to what happened in Nazi Germany. When Rangel made a similar allusion directed at new Ways and Means chair Bill Archer in 1995, Archer refused to speak to him for several years except at public meetings. Rangel also strongly opposed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, accusing Clinton of supporting it for political reasons and predicting its consequences would cast a million children into poverty.

Opening up economic opportunities for minorities and the poor was a focus of Rangel&#x27;s during the 1990s. His 1993 legislation created &quot;empowerment zones&quot;, which provided tax incentives for investment and job creation in inner urban areas; it would eventually account for $5 billion in federal spending across the nation&#x27;s cities. Rangel played a specific role in the creation of the 1995 Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation, which led to a $500 million spending of public and private monies towards changing the face of Harlem, including gentrification effects. Rangel served on the corporation&#x27;s board, and the effort was credited with helping the resurgence of Harlem that took place during the 1990s.

During the late 1990s, Rangel led an outreach effort on behalf of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that sought to gain African American votes for white candidates in key swing districts. The project may have helped gain or keep several seats during the 1998 mid-term House elections.
In late 1998, when long-time Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York announced his retirement, Rangel was one of the first to advocate that First Lady Hillary Clinton move to New York and run for the seat. She did so successfully.

On March 15, 1999, the congressman was arrested along with two other prominent African American leaders (civil rights activist Al Sharpton and former Mayor David Dinkins) for protesting the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant to the United States from Guinea, by four white and Hispanic New York City police officers. The officers involved were later acquitted by a mixed-race jury.

In October 1998, New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco filed a lawsuit charging the directors of the foundation behind New York&#x27;s Apollo Theater, including foundation chair Rangel, with failing to collect more than $4 million owed it by a company controlled by Percy Sutton that produced the television program &quot;It&#x27;s Showtime at the Apollo&quot;. The suit sought the removal of Rangel; after months of indecision, Rangel stepped down as chair but remained on the board. In October 1999, new Attorney General Eliot Spitzer dismissed the lawsuit and cleared Rangel and Sutton of any wrongdoing, saying that all monies properly owed had changed hands. Rangel expressed bitterness over the year-long episode, saying &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t have had to go through this.&quot;

===2000–2007: Protest and power===

During the early 2000s Rangel advocated continued funding of anti-poverty efforts, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Child care and development block grant. Rangel also had an unproductive relationship with Ways and Means chairman Bill Thomas, leading to an incident in which Thomas called the United States Capitol Police on Rangel for having his members read a bill in the library, an action for which Thomas apologized.

Rangel sponsored the African Growth and Opportunity Act, passed in 2000, despite the opposition of labor unions, the textile industry, and the Congressional Black Caucus. For the first time incentives were provided for U.S. trade with sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, Rangel became known for support of free trade agreements, in contrast to many House Democrats.

Following the September 11 attacks, Rangel helped secure an extension to unemployment benefits. His intent was to help those in New York industries affected by the events.

Motivated by seeing few African American diplomats on his trips abroad, he founded the Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Fellowship Program in 2002. The program is a collaboration between Howard University and the U.S. State Department that has significantly increased the number of minorities working in the U.S. Foreign Service.

In July 2004, Rangel was the first of three sitting U.S. House members to be arrested on trespassing charges, for protesting human rights abuses in Sudan in front of the Sudanese Embassy in Washington (Bobby Rush and Joe Hoeffel would follow). Rangel said, &quot;When human lives are in jeopardy, there should be outrage.&quot;

Rangel was an adamant opponent of the George W. Bush administration and of the Iraq War. Feeling powerless to stop the latter in the Republican-controlled Congress, he said in 2007 that he had suffered from nightmares: &quot;It was my lowest point ever in my 37 years in Congress ... It was a sad period where you saw lives being lost [in the war] and you couldn&#x27;t do anything about it.&quot;
In April 2006, Rangel and nine other representatives joined John Conyers&#x27; action against George W. Bush and others, alleging violations of the U.S. Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. &quot;Conyers v. Bush&quot; was dismissed later that year for lack of standing.

Rangel has been long been opposed to the all-volunteer army and repeatedly called for the government to bring back the draft (military conscription). In 2003, Rangel said that &quot;A disproportionate number of the poor and members of minority groups make up the enlisted ranks of the military, while the most privileged Americans are underrepresented or absent&quot;, and that a draft would make the military more representative of the American public at large. While some observers saw the logic in what Rangel was saying, his proposals attracted little organized support from either party or from antiwar organizations. During 2006 Rangel said that no soldier would be fighting in Iraq if they had decent career possibilities and stating:

Rangel introduced versions of his Universal National Service Act in the House in 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2010. Polls showed 70 percent of Americans opposed a reinstatement of the draft. Rangel emphasized that people could fulfill their draft obligations through non-military services, such as port and airline security. The one time the act came up for a vote in the full House, in 2004, it was defeated 2–402, with Rangel voting against his own bill in protest at the procedural handling of it.

In June 2006, the House Appropriations Committee passed a $3 million earmark to establish the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at City College of New York. By 2007 the amount had been reduced to $2 million, but the funding for the center, whose purpose was to bring more poor and minority students into politics, was the target of criticism from Representative John B. T. Campbell III of California and other Republicans as an abuse of the earmark process and as Rangel&#x27;s &quot;Monument to Me&quot;. City College said it was proud to house the center and Rangel said &quot;I cannot think of anything I am more proud of.&quot;

In August 2006, Rangel said he would resign his seat if the Democrats did not take the House that November, a statement that had real intent behind it, as at age 76 Rangel was feeling &quot;the claustrophobia&quot; of time. 

The Democrats did take control and in January 2007, Rangel&#x27;s long wait to head the Ways and Means Committee was over. Not only was he the first African American to do so, but he was also the first New Yorker to chair the committee since Fernando Wood in the 1870s. As holder of one of the most powerful posts in Congress, he said the chairmanship &quot;couldn&#x27;t have come any later for me&quot;. Age was not otherwise a factor with Rangel, who worked a scheduled 16 hours a day and looked a good deal younger than he was. &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine termed Rangel&#x27;s ascent to the chairmanship &quot;a watershed moment for African-Americans, who historically have been shut out when it comes to deciding how to divvy up the trillions of dollars in the federal government&#x27;s budget&quot;. Rangel was able to establish an effective working relationship with ranking member Jim McCrery.

In April 2007, Rangel published his autobiography, &quot;... And I Haven&#x27;t Had a Bad Day Since: From the Streets of Harlem to the Halls of Congress&quot;, whose title reflected his experience in Korea. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it a favorable reviewing, saying it was &quot;mercifully short on laundry lists [that some other political memoirs have], but long on sass and spirit&quot;.

Rangel was an early and strong supporter of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking a shot at the marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. As events in 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton&#x27;s support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying &quot;There&#x27;s just no question in my mind that Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain&#x27;t no time for a beginner.&quot; (Rangel&#x27;s wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.

===2008–2010: Ethics issues and censure===
====Letterhead use and Rangel Center fundraising====
In July 2008, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Rangel was soliciting donations to the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at City College of New York from corporations with business interests before his Ways and Means Committee, and was doing so using Congressional letterhead. The companies and individuals included AIG, Donald Trump, and Nabors Industries, and by this time Rangel&#x27;s efforts had helped raise $12 million of the $30 million goal for the center. Government watchdog groups and ethics experts criticized Rangel&#x27;s actions, with the dean of the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management saying Rangel &quot;has crossed the line&quot;.

Rangel denied any wrongdoing and asked the U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, commonly known as the House Ethics Committee, to determine if his use of Congressional letterhead while arranging meetings to solicit contributions for the center had violated any House rules. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to Rangel&#x27;s request.

====Renting Harlem apartments at below-market rates====
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in July 2008 that Rangel rents four apartments at below-market rates in the Lenox Terrace complex in Harlem. It reported that Rangel paid $3,894 monthly for all four apartments in 2007. In contrast, the landlord&#x27;s going rate for similar apartments in the building was as high as $8,125 monthly. Three adjacent apartments were combined to create his home. A fourth unit is used as a campaign office, which violates city and state regulations that require rent-stabilized apartments to be used as a primary residence. Rangel received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from one of the landlords, according to the paper. Rangel said his rent does not affect his representation of his constituents.

Congressional ethics experts said the difference in rent between what Rangel was paying and market rates, an estimated $30,000 per year, could be construed as a gift, exceeding the $100 House of Representatives gift limit. In late July, the House voted 254–138 to table a resolution by Republican Minority Leader John Boehner that would have censured Rangel for having &quot;dishonored himself and brought discredit to the House&quot;, by occupying the four apartments.

====House parking garage====
A September 2008 &quot;New York Post&quot; article reported that Rangel had been using a House parking garage as free storage space for his Mercedes-Benz for years, in apparent violation of Congressional rules. Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, free parking (here, worth $290 a month) is considered imputed income, and must be declared on tax returns. In July 2010 the House Ethics Committee ruled that Rangel had committed no violation, since in practice the parking policy was only applied to Congressional staff and not to members themselves.

====Taxes on Dominican villa rental income====
Rangel was accused of failing to report income from his rental of a beachside villa he owns in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. A three-bedroom, three-bath unit, it has rented out for as much as $1,100 per night in the busiest tourist season.

Labor lawyer Theodore Kheel, a principal investor in the resort development company and frequent campaign contributor to Rangel, had encouraged him to purchase the villa. Rangel purchased it in 1988 for $82,750. He financed $53,737.50 of the purchase price for seven years at an interest rate of 10.5%, but was one of several early investors whose interest payments were waived in 1990.

In September 2008, Rangel&#x27;s attorney, Lanny Davis, disclosed that Rangel had failed to report on his tax returns or in congressional disclosure forms $75,000 in income he had received for renting his Dominican villa. That month, Rangel paid $10,800 to cover his liability for the related back taxes. He had owed back taxes for at least three years. The Ways and Means Committee writes the U.S. tax code, and as such his failure to pay taxes himself led to heavy criticism.

A September 14, 2008, &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial called for Rangel to step down temporarily from his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee while his ethical problems were investigated.

On September 24, 2008, the House Ethics Committee announced that it would investigate whether Rangel had violated its code of conduct or any law or other regulation related to his performance of his duties. On November 23, 2008, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Rangel took a &quot;homestead&quot; tax break on his Washington, D.C., house for years, while simultaneously occupying multiple New York City rent-stabilized apartments, &quot;possibly violating laws and regulations in both cases&quot;. In January 2009, Republican Representative John R. Carter introduced the Rangel Rule Act of 2009 (H.R. 735), a tongue-in-cheek proposal that would have allowed all taxpayers to not pay penalties and interest on back taxes, in reference to Rangel not yet having paid his.

====Defense of tax shelter====

In November 2008, following reports by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Republican Congressmen asked the House Ethics Committee to look into Rangel&#x27;s defense of a tax shelter approved by his Ways and Means Committee. One of the four companies that benefited from the loophole was Nabors Industries, which opened headquarters in Bermuda as a foreign corporation. Under the loophole Nabors received tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks. In 2004, Rangel had led opposition to the tax breaks. Nabors donated $1 million in 2006, and $100,000 later, to the City College of New York school named after Rangel.

Its CEO said the donations were unrelated to Rangel&#x27;s February 2007 promise to oppose closing the loophole. He denied there was any &quot;quid pro quo&quot;, and called the article about it &quot;malarkey&quot;. Rangel said &quot;The New York Times&quot; had ignored facts and explanations, and denied the charges. The House Ethics Committee voted in December 2008, to expand its investigation of Rangel to the matter. Eventually the Ethics Committee would not make a specific charge over this matter but did include it in the supporting documentation for the overall charge that Rangel had solicited Rangel Center donations from those with business before his committee.

====Unreported assets and income====
On September 15, 2008, it was disclosed that: (a) Rangel had omitted from his financial reports details regarding his sale of a Washington, D.C. home; (b) discrepancies existed in the values he listed for a property he owns in Sunny Isles, Florida (varying from $50,000 to $500,000); and (c) inconsistencies appeared in his investment fund reporting. He apologized, saying &quot;I owed my colleagues and the public adherence to a higher standard of care, not only as a member of Congress, but even more as the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.&quot; Republicans called for his removal as chair. Rangel said there was no justification for that, as the mistakes were errors of omission, that would not justify loss of his position.

In August 2009, Rangel amended his 2007 financial disclosure form to report more than $500,000 in previously unreported assets and income. That doubled his reported net worth. Unreported assets included a federal credit union checking account of between $250,000 and $500,000, several investment accounts, stock in Yum! Brands and PepsiCo, and property in Glassboro, New Jersey. Rangel also had not paid property taxes on two of his New Jersey properties which he was required by law to do.

The ethics issues led by December 2008 to some loss of standing for Rangel, to Republicans trying to tie him to all Democrats, and to some Democrats privately saying it would be best if Rangel stepped down from his Ways and Means post. 
In late 2008 and again in September 2009, the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Rangel one of the 15 most corrupt members of Congress. Media pieces compared Rangel&#x27;s woes with those unethical former Ways and Means chairs Wilbur Mills and Dan Rostenkowski. Pelosi, a long-time friend of Rangel&#x27;s, withheld any possible action against Rangel pending the House Ethics Committee report. Rangel evinced impatience with that body, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t have a complaint now, except that it&#x27;s taking too goddamn long to review this thing and report back.&quot;
On September 3, 2009, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called on Rangel to resign his chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee, given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth to force him out of his chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the Obama health care reform plan (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him.

====Caribbean trips====
In May 2009, the non-profit National Legal and Policy Center filed an ethics complaint against Rangel and other members of Congress for trips, taken in 2007 and 2008 to Caribbean islands. The trips had been sponsored by Carib News Foundation, a New York non-profit funded by corporations with interests before Congress and the Ways and Means Committee. This combined with the duration of the trips seemed to violate House rules. The Ethics Committee agreed the following month to investigate the matter.

On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee issued its report. It determined that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his travel to the conferences. The committee found that he had not known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost. Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. Rangel disagreed with the committee&#x27;s finding, saying:

Pelosi said she would not take any action against Rangel pending further committee findings, as his staff had been more at fault and he had not broken any law. The Ethics Committee continued to investigate the charges against Rangel relating to obtaining rent-stabilized apartments, fundraising, and failure to disclose rental income from his Dominican villa.

====Stepping aside as House Ways and Means Chair====
After a February 2010 House Ethics Committee report criticizing him for taking sponsored Caribbean trips, the White House backed off its prior support of Rangel somewhat, and within days 14 Democratic members of Congress publicly called on Rangel to step aside as Ways and Means chair. Other Democrats were concerned that Rangel would impede Democrats&#x27; efforts to maintain their majority in the 2010 House elections, but did not say anything publicly out of respect and personal affection for Rangel. 
Momentum quickly built against Rangel, with 30 or more Democrats planning to oppose his continued chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee, in a full House vote being pushed by Republicans. Democrat Paul Hodes of New Hampshire noted:

On March 3, 2010, Rangel said he would take a leave of absence as chair, pending issuance of the Ethics Committee&#x27;s report. Pelosi granted his request, but whether such a leave was possible was unclear and the House Speaker pro Tempore said that a resignation had taken place and that Rangel was no longer chair. Observers opined that it was unlikely that Rangel would ever be able to regain the position. Several Democrats said they would return or donate to charity campaign contributions given to them by Rangel. Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan took over as acting chair.

====House ethics committee charges====
On July 22, 2010, a bipartisan, four-member investigative subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee indicated it had &quot;substantial reason to believe&quot; that Rangel had violated a range of ethics rules relating to the other charges. The matter was referred to another, newly created, special subcommittee to rule on the findings. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the action indicated the &quot;process is working as it should, while Minority Leader John Boehner called the announcement &quot;a sad reminder&quot; of Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s &quot;most glaring broken promise: to &#x27;drain the swamp&#x27; in Washington&quot;.

Rangel negotiated with the Ethics Committee. But participants in the talks characterized him as unwilling to admit wrongdoing in connection with several of the charges, and anxious about preserving his legacy. No settlement was reached.

On July 29, 2010, Rangel was charged by the committee with 13 counts of violating House rules and federal laws. Rangel&#x27;s lawyers continued to insist that he had not intentionally violated any law or regulation, had not handed out political favors, and had not misused his office for personal financial gain. Rangel somberly only said this on the day the charges were announced:

Sixty years ago, I survived a Chinese attack in North Korea. And as a result I wrote a book that, having survived that, that I haven&#x27;t had a bad day since. Today I have to reassess that.

====Re-election campaign of 2010====
Rangel suggested that Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s primary run in the 2010 gubernatorial election against incumbent David Paterson, who was the first African American governor of New York, would undo years of work that Cuomo spent rebuilding his standing in the state Democratic Party after his bruising 2002 gubernatorial primary contest against Carl McCall. At the time McCall was the highest-ranking African American and first major party candidate for governor in the state. Rangel had been a staunch supporter of McCall against Cuomo in 2002. For the upcoming 2010 gubernatorial race, Rangel suggested that for the white Cuomo to challenge the African American incumbent would not be &quot;the moral decision&quot;. Rangel said, &quot;There might be an inclination for racial polarization in a primary in the state of New York. Since we have most African Americans registered as Democrats, and since you would be making an appeal for Democrats, it would be devastating in my opinion.&quot; Paterson fared poorly in polls due to several scandals and later abandoned his campaign re-election. By this point Rangel&#x27;s continuing difficulties, along with the death a few months prior of Percy Sutton and the failure of Paterson (Basil A. Paterson&#x27;s son), marked the end of the era of Harlem&#x27;s &quot;Gang of Four&quot;.

Rangel faced several Democratic primary challengers for his seat in 2010: Vincent Morgan, whose grassroots campaign bore many resemblances to Rangel&#x27;s own against the scandal-plagued Adam Clayton Powell Jr., in 1970; Adam Clayton Powell IV, who had previously challenged Rangel in 1994; labor activist and past primary candidate for statewide office Jonathan Tasini; and former Obama campaign official Joyce Johnson. While Rangel&#x27;s fund-raising was down from previous years, and he had paid nearly $2 million in legal fees, he still had far more cash available for the campaign than any of his challengers.

On September 14, 2010, Rangel prevailed in the primary election, gaining 51 percent of the vote against Powell&#x27;s 23 percent and lesser amounts for the other contenders. He then won the November 2, 2010, general election easily, garnering 80 percent of the vote against Republican Michel Faulkner&#x27;s 10 percent and smaller amounts for third-party candidates.

====House ethics trial and censure====
On November 15, 2010, Rangel&#x27;s formal ethics trial began. He walked out of the hearing at the start, saying that he was unable to afford representation after having paid his previous lawyers over $2 million, and arguing unsuccessfully that the proceeding should be delayed until he could arrange for a legal defense fund.

On November 16, 2010, Rangel was found guilty on 11 of the 12 standing charges against him by the adjudicatory subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee. Two of the charges were focused on his actions with regards to soliciting funds and donations for the Rangel Center from those with business before the Ways and Means Committee; four were for improper use of Congressional letterhead and other House resources in those solicitations; one was for submitting incomplete and inaccurate financial disclosure statements; one was for using one of his Harlem apartments as an office when he had Congressional dealings with the landlord; one was for failing to pay taxes on his Dominican villa; and two reiterated these charges in describing general violations of House rules.

Two days later, a near-tears Rangel pleaded for &quot;fairness and mercy&quot; and he had support from fellow Representative John Lewis. But it was to no avail; the full Committee voted 9–1 to recommend that the full House approve a sanction of censure upon Rangel. The committee stated: &quot;Public office is a public trust [and Rangel] violated that trust.&quot; Censure is the strongest penalty the House can impose short of outright expulsion from Congress. The committee also said that Rangel should make restitution for any unpaid taxes.

Supporters of Rangel argued that by comparison with previous cases, a reprimand would be a more fitting punishment for Rangel&#x27;s trangressions than censure. Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had all along, that nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself. It was to no avail. On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel. Ethics committee chair Zoe Lofgren emphasized that it was Rangel&#x27;s &quot;accumulation of actions&quot; that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones. A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146; most of Speaker Pelosi&#x27;s allies rejected it and over 105 Democrats voted the resolution down. The House of Representatives then voted 333–79 to censure Rangel. Only two Republicans voted against censure, Peter T. King of Long Island and Don Young of Alaska. Per custom Rangel went to the well of the House to hear Speaker Pelosi solemnly read the formal measure of censure. It had been 27 years since the last such measure and Rangel was only the 23rd House member to be censured. Rangel asked to speak and said, &quot;I know in my heart I am not going to be judged by this Congress. I&#x27;ll be judged by my life in its entirety.&quot;

===2011–2017: Final years in Congress===

Republicans took over control of the House as the 112th Congress began in January 2011, meaning Rangel would have lost his Ways and Means chair even without his ethics issues. He was not considered for the ranking member slot either, which after a contested election among the Democratic caucus had gone to former acting chair Sander Levin. His difficulties were not completely over; the National Legal and Policy Center filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that he had improperly paid legal bills from a political action committee. To cover both ongoing and past legal expenses he established a legal defense fund (whose creation was approved by the House Ethics Committee).

He was the first elected politician to use the now-defunct Visible Vote mobile app to interact directly with his constituents.

During 2011 Rangel became the first member of Congress to declare support for the Occupy Wall Street movement and made several visits to their nearby demonstration site in Zuccotti Park. However the protesters themselves picketed Rangel&#x27;s office, objecting to his free trade stance (in particular to agreements he supported with Panama and with South Korea that they said resulted in jobs being exported).

In early 2012, Rangel was beset by a back injury and a serious viral infection; he was away from Congress for three months. Moreover, his district had been renumbered as the 13th District following the 2010 census, and its demographics had been changed significantly. He found himself in a district that stretched from Harlem to the Bronx and was now majority-Hispanic; it was 55 percent Hispanic and 27 percent African American. As a result, Rangel faced a serious primary challenge from State Senator Adriano Espaillat. Rangel struggled with fundraising, and he began receiving contributions from fellow members of Congress whom he had helped over the years. In the June 26 primary – the real contest in what was still an overwhelmingly Democratic district – Rangel defeated Espaillat by less than a thousand votes, with a result that took two weeks to fully resolve. He won the subsequent November general election easily.

In April 2013, Rangel filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against several members and staff of the House Ethics Committee, saying that they had engaged in &quot;numerous, flagrant, knowing and intentional violations&quot; in their investigation against him. The suit sought to overturn the measure of censure that had been taken against him. In December 2013, Judge John D. Bates dismissed the suit, saying that there were &quot;insurmountable separation-of-powers barriers&quot; against the courts becoming involved in House of Representatives internal actions. Rangel appealed the dismissal, but the judge&#x27;s action was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in May 2015, saying the matter fell outside the jurisdiction of the courts. In October 2015, the United States Supreme Court declined to consider the case ending Rangel&#x27;s legal bid.

Rangel ran again in 2014, facing Espaillat once more in the Democratic primary as well as Reverend Michael Walrond from the First Corinthian Baptist Church. Rangel said that if he was re-elected, it would be his final term in the House. He lost some of his traditional endorsements, but retained others and campaigned hard even while turning 84 years of age. In the June 24 primary the voting was again close but Rangel prevailed over Espaillat. Rangel faced no Republican opposition in the November general election and won easily against a minor party candidate, saying as he voted on November 4, &quot;Today was a historic day and a very emotional day [as] I cast my final vote as a candidate on the ballot...&quot;

After being strongly opposed to Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s March 3, 2015, speech to Congress (in which, at the invitation of House Republicans, the Israeli Prime Minister spoke in opposition to the Obama administration&#x27;s efforts to secure a comprehensive agreement on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program) and saying he would be one of those Democrats not attending, Rangel changed his mind and did attend, attributing his reversal to the advice of friends and constituents and saying, &quot;Enough damage has already been done... I don&#x27;t want my absence to add to what is already a shattered type of relationship.&quot;

Due to a large personal loan he made and his continuing struggles with fundraising, Rangel&#x27;s 2014 re-election campaign debt stood at $140,000 as of June 2015. He engaged in various fundraising efforts during 2015 in an effort to reduce this debt, which brought about some criticism from The Center for Public Integrity that these efforts were not fully transparent. He had planned to raise money towards paying off that debt at his 85th birthday celebration to be held at the Plaza Hotel that month. Guests included Lady Gaga, Tony Bennett, and Hillary Clinton, however Clinton took over Rangel&#x27;s party as a &quot;Hillary for America&quot; event to raise money for her 2016 presidential campaign.

As he had vowed two years earlier, Rangel did not run for re-election in the 2016 election. In the June 2016 Democratic primary election to effectively pick his successor, Rangel supported State Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright expressing the hope that an African American would continue to represent the district. However Espaillat won a close victory over Wright in a large field of candidates. Underlining the demographic changes that had been taking place, after winning the general election in November Espaillat became the first non-African American to represent Harlem in the House since a series of Harlem-focused congressional districts were formed beginning in the 1940s. Rangel left office at the expiration of his term on January 3, 2017.

==Later years==
After his retirement, Rangel has been occasionally active in public life. He gave reflective interviews that also commented on the future course of Harlem. He endorsed Robert Jackson in his successful bid to unseat Marisol Alcantara in New York&#x27;s 31st State Senate district in a 2018 race, and he endorsed Joe Biden during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.

When asked in 2019 whether he had ever witnessed any racist comments made by Donald Trump prior to his presidency, Rangel said he had not, but added: &quot;I don&#x27;t remember any remarks he ever made that was not sharing with me how much he thought about himself. It was always the same story.&quot;

Rangel served as grand marshal of Harlem&#x27;s African American Day Parade in 2019. He rode in the parade again in 2022, at age 92, when it resumed following COVID-19 cancellations.

==Political positions==
Various advocacy groups have given Rangel scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group. Overall as of 2003, Rangel had an average lifetime 91 percent &quot;liberal quotient&quot; from Americans for Democratic Action. In contrast, the American Conservative Union assessed to Rangel a lifetime rating of less than 4 percent through 2009. &quot;National Journal&quot; rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the political spectrum, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Rangel&#x27;s averages were as follows: economic rating 91 percent liberal and 6 percent conservative, social rating 94 percent liberal and 5 percent conservative, and foreign rating 84 percent liberal and 14 percent conservative.

Project Vote Smart provides the ratings of many, many lesser known interest groups with respect to Rangel. Rangel typically had 100 ratings from NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood
and, inversely, 0 ratings or close to that from the National Right to Life Committee. 
He has typically gotten very high ratings in the 90s or 100 from the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The League of Conservation Voters has usually given Rangel around a 90 rating.
Taxpayers for Common Sense has given Rangel ratings in the middling 40–50 range, while
the National Taxpayers Union has typically given Rangel very low ratings or an &#x27;F&#x27; grade.

==Political image==

Rangel is known as an energetic, genial, and sociable politician, one who is able to gain friendship and influence by means of charm, humor, and candor. He was called &quot;Charlie&quot; by everyone in Congress from the highest-ranking members to the custodial employees. Of his political skills, 1980s Ways and Means chair Dan Rostenkowski said, &quot;Charlie has the gifted knack of getting you to change your position, and you actually enjoy doing it. Compromising isn&#x27;t so unusual in Congress. Enjoying it is.&quot; The New York congressman&#x27;s ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called &quot;Rangeling&quot; by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill. Many of his closest friends and allies in Congress have not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts. O&#x27;Neill aide Chris Matthews said these members were &quot;tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent&quot;.

Rangel has been described as having a meticulous appearance. Long-time mentor Percy Sutton recalled, &quot;In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because he was one of those handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.&quot; Later &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him thusly: &quot;After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally.&quot; In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of. The congressman&#x27;s life has been dominated by politics with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested when he was being investigated for possible ethics violations and a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York&#x27;s Plaza Hotel.

Rangel has been known for his blunt speaking and candor. When asked how he would like to be remembered, he paraphrased Rhett Butler in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;: &quot;Well, ... if I&#x27;m gone, quite frankly, I don&#x27;t give a damn.&quot; In any case he has often made controversial remarks.

Some have been linked to his caustic criticism of George W. Bush&#x27;s administration. Speaking at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare Bush to the Southern Democrat Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, saying: &quot;George Bush is our Bull Connor.&quot; A few days later he said both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney who said, &quot;I&#x27;m frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that... Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess.&quot; Rangel responded by saying, &quot;The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself... He should look so good at seventy-five.&quot;
Rangel again expressed his displeasure with the vice president in October 2006 – after Cheney had said that &quot;Charlie doesn&#x27;t understand how the economy works&quot; – by opining that Cheney is &quot;a real son of a bitch&quot; who &quot;enjoys a confrontation&quot; and suggesting that Cheney required professional treatment for mental defects. The White House said that the vice president did not take Rangel&#x27;s comments personally and had a &quot;big hearty laugh&quot; over them.
Rangel sometimes seems to find the other side; following the 2006 Hugo Chávez speech at the United Nations in which the Venezuelan leader implied that Bush was the devil, Rangel said, &quot;I want President Chávez to please understand that even though many people in the United States are critical of our president that we resent the fact that he would come to the United States and criticize President Bush... you don&#x27;t come into my country, you don&#x27;t come into my congressional district and you don&#x27;t condemn my president.&quot;

Other remarks of Rangel&#x27;s have revolved around Rangel&#x27;s feelings about his home state and city, such as disparaging the state of Mississippi 
or suggesting that President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama might be unsafe if they visited New York.
In both cases apologies from the congressman followed. In certain instances, his remarks only exacerbated his existing problems. When his ethics issues were made public, Rangel remarked that Governor of Alaska and Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was &quot;disabled&quot;. In 2013, he compared the Tea Party movement to segregationists who opposed the Civil Rights Movement and said they could be defeated the same way: &quot;It is the same group we faced in the South with those white crackers and the dogs and the police. They didn&#x27;t care about how they looked. It was just fierce indifference to human life that caused America to say enough is enough.&quot;

==Electoral history==

After defeating Adam Clayton Powell Jr. in the Democratic primary in 1970, Rangel won re-election to represent New York&#x27;s 18th, 19th, 16th, 15th, 13th districts at different times.

==Awards and honors==
In 1986, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation awarded Rangel with the William L. Dawson Award.

Rangel was given the Jackie Robinson Foundation&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. In 2006, he received the Distinguished Service Award from the Washington International Trade Association.

Rangel has received a number of honorary degrees, including ones from Hofstra University (1989), Syracuse University (2001), Suffolk University Law School (2002), and Bard College (2008). In 2006 he received a Presidential Medal from Baruch College.

<text>Marvel Knights is an imprint of Marvel Comics that contained standalone material taking place inside the Marvel Universe (Earth-616). The imprint originated in 1998 when Marvel outsourced four titles (&quot;Black Panther&quot;, &quot;Punisher&quot;, &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;Inhumans&quot;) to Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti&#x27;s company Event Comics; Event hired the creative teams for the Knights line while Marvel published them.

==History==
In 1998, Marvel Comics, which had just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, asked Quesada and Palmiotti to work for Marvel in a more exclusive capacity, and contracted them and their Event Comics partners to produce a line of Marvel books dubbed &quot;Marvel Knights&quot;. As editors of Marvel Knights, Quesada and Palmiotti worked on a number of low-profile characters such as &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;Punisher&quot;, &quot;The Inhumans&quot; and &quot;Black Panther&quot;, encouraging experimentation and using their contacts in the independent comics world to bring in creators such as David W. Mack, Mike Oeming, Brian Michael Bendis, Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon. Quesada himself also illustrated a &quot;Daredevil&quot; story written by film director Kevin Smith with Palmiotti inking the title book.

Marvel Knights stepped away from the long-running story arcs and heavy focus on continuity that was a prime feature of Marvel Comics during this period; instead, the imprint focused on strong stand-alone stories and high production qualities.

In addition to the headlining Daredevil title with Smith/Quesada/Palmiotti, the line also featured initial release titles of Punisher (from Christopher Golden, Bernie Wrightson and Jimmy Palmiotti); the Inhumans (Paul Jenkins, Jae Lee and Jose Villarrubia) and Black Panther (Christopher Priest and Mark Texeria). Several of these titles laid the ground work for several Marvel TV and movie story ideas and concepts. The title went on to feature Black Widow, new Punisher titles, the Sentry and several more events.

In 2000, two-and-a-half years after starting Marvel Knights — and in large part due to the imprint&#x27;s success — Quesada was named editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics. Palmiotti remained involved in some of the titles for a limited period either inking or editing before leaving.

In early 2006 Quesada announced that all ongoing titles under the &quot;Marvel Knights&quot; banner would move to the Marvel Universe imprint and that &quot;Marvel Knights&quot; would afterward contain high-profile limited series. Quesada explained that Marvel Knights...

The change began with &quot;Daredevil&quot; #82, &quot;Black Panther&quot; #14, &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1, &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot; #1, and &quot;Wolverine&quot; #42. &quot;Marvel Knights Spider-Man&quot; became &quot;The Sensational Spider-Man&quot; with issue #23, and &quot;Marvel Knights 4&quot; (featuring the Fantastic Four) became simply &quot;4&quot; with issue #28.

&quot;&quot;, by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, was the first limited series to launch under the redefined imprint in February 2006. This was followed by &quot;Silver Surfer: Requiem&quot; by J. Michael Straczynski and Esad Ribić (2007), &quot;Spider-Man: Reign&quot; by Kaare Andrews (late 2006), &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; by Garth Ennis and Clayton Crain (2007), and &quot;Captain America: The Chosen&quot; (September 2007).

Marvel Knights editor Axel Alonso wrote in a press release:

Marvel Knights became dormant after 2013. However, a six issue limited anniversary run entitled Marvel Knights 20th was started in 2018 and ran into 2019.

==Team==
The Marvel Knights team was a name given to Daredevil&#x27;s unnamed superhero team. Besides Daredevil, the line-up consisted of Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger, Morbius, Elektra, Blade, Ghost Rider, The Punisher, Moon Knight, Shang-Chi, Black Knight and Luke Cage.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Knights 2099===

In 2004, Marvel Comics held a fifth-week event called &quot;Marvel Knights 2099&quot;, which took place in the future on an alternate world (Earth-2992) that was not identical to the alternate Marvel Universe on Earth-928 featured in the 1990s Marvel 2099 books.
* &quot;Daredevil 2099&quot; #1
* &quot;Black Panther 2099&quot; #1
* &quot;Inhumans 2099&quot; #1
* &quot;Punisher 2099&quot; #1
* &quot;Mutant 2099&quot; #1

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of the Marvel Knights team made its debut in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #106 in the arc called &quot;Warriors&quot;. The members of the Ultimate Marvel version of the Marvel Knight include Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Shang-Chi, Iron Fist, Moon Knight, and Spider-Man.

After Shang-Chi made an unsuccessful attack on the Kingpin, he was recruited by Daredevil to help bring down the Kingpin for good. Later, Daredevil, as Matt Murdock, met Spider-Man and asked him to join the group, with the plan of killing the Kingpin. Spider-Man objected to killing, and the group agreed to let Moon Knight, under the persona of Ronin join the Kingpin&#x27;s employ. Ronin forcibly brought Spider-Man to the Kingpin as a captive. The Kingpin ties him up, unmasks him and tortures him and mocks him for being a teenager. After revealing that he knew that Ronin was Moon Knight, Kingpin had him beaten nearly to death, and let Spider-Man leave with the knowledge that one of the Knights was a traitor.

After a bomb destroyed the law offices of Matt Murdock, Iron Fist was revealed as the traitor, though only because Kingpin threatened his daughter. Iron Fist was sent back to Kingpin to distract him while Daredevil tried to kill his comatose wife. After a standoff between Daredevil, Kingpin, and Spider-Man, Kingpin agreed to leave the country in exchange for his wife&#x27;s safety, but he secretly and furiously plotted to have Daredevil killed, Dr. Strange&#x27;s hands broken, and Spider-Man&#x27;s school blown up. Meanwhile, Moon Knight went to the police, revealed his secret identity, and said that Kingpin tried to kill him, which gave the police enough to arrest Kingpin on attempted murder charges. At the end of the arc there were brief images of the team going their separate ways: Shang-Chi caught a train out of town, Iron Fist returned to his daughter, Dr. Strange went back to his sanctum, and Daredevil berated himself at a church.

==In other media==
===Film===
Marvel Knights was also the name of a production arm of Marvel Entertainment intended to be used to produce some of Marvel&#x27;s darker and lesser-known titles: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot; were the only films released under the &quot;Marvel Knights&quot; banner.

The Marvel Knights books have had several influences on Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and TV shows. From the Netflix Marvel TV shows to the 2018 &quot;Black Panther&quot; film, the characters they created have been noted as coming directly from the comics. Christopher Priest credited the Dora Milaje to both Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti.

===Video games===
* The team appears in &quot;Marvel: Ultimate Alliance&quot; series, excluding the second game:
** In the &quot;&quot; video game, Marvel Knights is a team bonus granted if you have any combination of the following characters on your team: Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Wolverine, Luke Cage, Spider-Man, Elektra Natchios and Moon Knight.
** In the video game &quot;Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order&quot;, the current members of Marvel Knights consist those who are also the members of either Defenders, Midnight Sons or both. The initial playable characters consist Hulk, Daredevil, Elektra Natchios, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Loki Laufeyson, Doctor Strange, Elsa Bloodstone and Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze); while Defenders Valkyrie (Brunnhilde) and Jessica Jones serves as non-playable allies of the group. The DLC pass adds additional Marvel Knights Punisher, Blade, Moon Knight and Michael Morbius.

<text>Ali Kafi (; ALA-LC: &quot;ʿAlī Kāfī&quot;; 7 October 1928 – 16 April 2013) was an Algerian politician who was Chairman of the High Council of State and acting President from 1992 to 1994.

==Early life==
Ali Kafi was born in El Harrouch in 1928.

==Career==
Ali Kafi was one of the major figures of the Algerian underground forces that fought for independence from France from 1954 to 1962. At that time he was promoted to the rank of colonel. Kafi was the Algerian ambassador to several countries, including Syria, Egypt, Iraq and Italy.

He served as the chairman of the High Council of State (a military-backed collective presidency) of Algeria from 2 July 1992 to 31 January 1994. He was selected as chairman after the assassination of Muhammad Boudiaf.

The Council of State was intended as a transitional government during the civil war. The purpose of the council of state was to redirect the nation towards prosperity. The councils hard work was tarnished by the following president after Liamine Zeroual, Abdel Aziz Bouteflika, amidst corruption charges.

==Death and burial==

Kafi died at the age of 84 on 16 April 2013 in Geneva, Switzerland. His body was buried at El-Alia cemetery.

== Honours ==

===National honour===
* Grand Master of the National Order of Merit

<doc id="410384" wikidata="Q674818" url="?curid=410384" title="Penile plethysmography">
<text>Penile plethysmography (PPG) or phallometry is a measurement of blood flow to the penis, typically used as a proxy for measurement of sexual arousal. The most commonly reported methods of conducting penile plethysmography involves the measurement of the circumference of the penis with a mercury-in-rubber or electromechanical strain gauge, or the volume of the penis with an airtight cylinder and inflatable cuff at the base of the penis. Corpora cavernosa nerve penile plethysmographs measure changes in response to inter-operative electric stimulation during surgery. The volumetric procedure was invented by Kurt Freund and is considered to be particularly sensitive at low arousal levels. The easier to use circumferential measures are more widely used, however, and more common in studies using erotic film stimuli. A corresponding device in women is the vaginal photoplethysmograph.

For sexual offenders it is typically used to determine the level of sexual arousal as the subject is exposed to sexually suggestive content, such as pictures, movies or audio, although some have argued that phallometry is not always appropriate for the evaluation of sexual preferences or treatment effects. A 1998 large-scale meta-analytic review of the scientific reports demonstrated that phallometric response to stimuli depicting children, though only having a .32 correlation with future sex offending (accounting for approximately 10% of the variance), had the highest accuracy among methods of identifying which sexual offenders will go on to commit new sexual crimes. (None of the methods were strong predictors with most accounting for far less than 10% of the variance).

In prostatectomy nerve-sparing surgery, the surgeon applies a mild electrical stimulation near the cavernous nerves of penis to verify their locations and avoid operative trauma. Damage to these difficult-to-see nerves can cause erectile dysfunction outcomes. At the surgery&#x27;s conclusion, the electrical stimulation penile plethysmograph result is a prognosis which helps to manage the erectile function outcomes earlier than the many months required for recovery.

==Types==

There are two types of penile plethysmograph:
* Volumetric air chamber
:When this is placed over the subject&#x27;s penis, as tumescence increases, the air displaced is measured.
* Circumferential transducer
:This uses a mercury-in-rubber or indium/gallium-in-rubber ring or electromechanical strain gauge and is placed around the shaft of the subject&#x27;s penis to measure changes in circumference.

The circumferential type is more common, but the volumetric method is believed to be more accurate at low arousal levels.

Significant suppliers of PPG machines include Behavioral Technology Inc. and Medical Monitoring Systems. The device is known to be used in Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Norway, Slovak Republic, Spain, and the United States.

The surgical machine is supplied as CaverMap by Blue Torch Medical Technology, Inc.

A roughly equivalent procedure for women, vaginal photoplethysmography, measures blood through the walls of the vagina, which researchers claim increases during sexual arousal.

==Methodology==
Exact procedures can vary, but in one study a seventeen-year-old male sex offender was, at the start of each daily session, privately fitted with a Parks Medical Electronics mercury strain gauge attached to his penis and worn under trousers and underwear. The device had previously been calibrated with measurements from his penis in its flaccid state and at full erection as achieved through masturbation. This device was connected to a microprocessor, a battery pack, and a strain gauge amplifier, all of which were kept discreetly in a fanny pack. He was then driven daily to a college campus for multiple sessions to assess his sexual attraction to women and men, who were about 30–100 feet away from him. While remaining in a parked car, he was instructed to focus on either a specific woman or a specific man in the setting, imagine himself having sex with them, and allow himself to become sexually aroused if he was so inclined. The device then measured the percentage of full erection that he achieved. This was repeated over a period of 24 days, with the results showing a significantly greater level of attraction to women, especially when research staff were discreetly absent.

==History==
The original volumetric was developed during the 1950s by Kurt Freund in then-Czechoslovakia. Freund later wrote, &quot;In the early fifties homosexual interaction was still an indictable offense in Czechoslovakia. I was of course opposed to this measure, but I still thought, as did my colleagues at the psychiatric university hospital in Prague where I was working, that homosexuality was an experientially acquired neurosis&quot;. He then developed phallometry to replace psychoanalytic methods of assessment because &quot;[P]sychoanalysis had turned out to be a failure, virtually unusable as an instrument for individual diagnosis or research...When phallometry began to look promising as a test of erotic sex and age preferences, we started using it mainly as a test of pedophilia, that is determining who has an erotic preference for children over adults&quot;.

In post–World War II Czechoslovakia, Freund was assigned by the communist government the task of identifying among military conscripts men who were falsely declaring themselves to be gay to avoid the draft. &quot;Freund (1957) developed the first device, which measured penile volume changes... to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual males for the Czechoslovakian army.&quot; When he escaped Europe for Canada, Freund was able to pursue his research using phallometry for the assessment of sexual offenders. At that time, attempts to develop methods of changing homosexual men into heterosexual men were being made by many sexologists, including John Bancroft, Albert Ellis, and William Masters of the Masters and Johnson Institute. Because phallometry showed that such methods were failures, Freund was among the first sexologists to declare that such attempts were unethical. Based primarily on Freund&#x27;s studies, decriminalization of homosexuality took place in Czechoslovakia in 1961. (See also LGBT rights in the Czech Republic.)

==Reliability and validity==
In 1994, the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (Fourth Edition) of the American Psychiatric Association stated that penile plethysmography has been used in research settings to assess various paraphilias by measuring an individual&#x27;s sexual arousal in response to visual and auditory stimuli. The reliability and validity of this procedure in clinical assessment have not been well established, and clinical experience suggests that subjects can simulate response by manipulating mental images.&quot; In contrast, a 2017 recent meta-analysis provides support for the validity of phallometric testing as a measure of sexual interests in children across 37 samples and 6,785 individuals.

In 1998, Hanson and Bussière published a comprehensive meta-analysis of 61 scientific reports on the prediction of sexual offenses spanning more than 40,000 individual cases. They ascertained that of all the methods attempted and reported, penile phethysmographic responses to imagery depicting children was the single most accurate predictor of sexual re-offense across 7 studies reporting data from phallometric testing. Another meta-analysis in 2005 of 13 studies and 2,180 individual cases repeated the finding that phallometric responses to children was a strong predictor of sexual re-offense.

A 2017 meta-analysis that included 16 samples and 2,709 sexual offenders replicated and extended the previous findings that phallometric responding to children is a predictor of sexual re-offence. This meta-analysis extended previous meta-analytic research by showing phallometric responding to both male and female pedophilic and hebephilic stimuli predict sexual re-offence. Further, this meta-analysis showed that phallometric testing predicts sexual re-offence in distinct subgroups of sexual offenders against children.

===Critique of methodological problems===
There are criticisms of the methodology used to determine the reliability and specificity of penile plethysmography. One such criticism is that while penile plethysmography is said to be important for being more objective than a test subject&#x27;s subjective reports on sexual arousal, the argument for penile plethysmography being a more reliable gauge of sexual arousal than vaginal plethysmography is still that there is a higher correspondence on average between what the test subjects report and what the instruments observe in male subjects than in female subjects. There is a criticism of this discrepancy for lacking consistency in the standards of whether or not subjective reports are useful. There is also criticism regarding the possibility of sampling bias being greater in male subjects of penile plethysmography than in female subjects of vaginal plethysmography, males being generally more aware of their physical sexual responses than females in most cultures may cause the male volunteers to be almost exclusively individuals who have category specific erections due to those with nonspecific erections fearing erection in taboo contexts and therefore not signing up for the studies. This effect may explain apparent male specificity as a result of methodological bias. The difference between tests of volunteers and tests of convicted or suspected sex offenders in penile plethysmography results may be caused by the sex offender group often effectively lacking the choice not to volunteer, without difference in erection patterns from the average population. One criticism of reoffending studies is that cultural attitudes that assume that men are sexually attracted to what they phallometrically respond to may cause men with no actual sexual interest in children to identify as pedophiles due to knowing that they phallometrically respond to them, making them more likely to be convicted again.

==Utility==

=== Erectile dysfunction ===
The penile plethysmograph has value in screening organic versus psychogenic erectile dysfunction in urological polysomnography centres. Lack of sexual response during REM sleep may indicate that further evaluation by a urologist is required.

When applied during nerve-sparing surgery, electrical stimulation penile plethysmograph is an erectile dysfunction prognostic. The patient is provided with objective information on his specific outcome which aids in planning for further erectile function therapies.

===Pedophilia, hebephilia, pedohebephilia, and ephebophilia===
Studies examining the efficiency of using penile plethysmograph to distinguish pedophilic men from non-pedophilic men, including hebephiles, show that a majority can be correctly assigned to the proper category. Sensitivity of a phallometric test is defined as the accuracy of the test to identify pedophilic (or hebephilic) individuals as having these sexual interests. Specificity of these tests is defined as the accuracy of the test to identify non-pedophilic (or non-hebephilic) individuals as such. Meta-analytic research has shown that sexual offenders against children show greater responding on phallometric tests for pedophilia and hebephilia than controls.

==== Volumetric penile plethysmography ====
In one study, 21% of the subjects were excluded for various reasons, including &quot;the subject&#x27;s erotic age-preference was uncertain and his phallometrically diagnosed sex-preference was the same as his verbal claim&quot; and attempts to influence the outcome of the test. This study found the sensitivity for identifying pedohebephilia in sexual offenders against children admitting to this interest to be 100%. In addition, the sensitivity for this phallometric test in partially admitting sexual offenders against children was found to be 77% and for denying sexual offenders against children to be 58%. The specificity of this volumetric phallometric test for pedohebephilia was estimated to be 95%.

Further studies by Freund have estimated the sensitivity of a volumetric test for pedohebephilia to be 35% for sexual offenders against children with a single female victim, 70% for those with two or more female victims, 77% for those offenders with one male victim, and 84% for those with two or more male victims. In this study, the specificity of the test was estimated to be 81% in community males and 97% in sexual offenders against adults. In a similar study, the sensitivity of a volumetric test for pedophilia to be 62% for sexual offenders against children with a single female victim, 90% for those with two or more female victims, 76% for those offenders with one male victim, and 95% for those with two or more male victims.

In a separate study, sensitivity of the method to distinguish between pedohebephilic men from non-pedohebephilic men was estimated between 29% and 61% depending on subgroup. Specifically, sensitivity was estimated to be 61% for sexual offenders against children with three or more victims and 34% in incest offenders. The specificity of the test using a sample of sexual offenders against adults was 96% and the area under the curve for the test was estimated to be .86. Further research by this group found the specificity of this test to be 83% in a sample of non-offenders. More recent research has found volumetric phallometry to have a sensitivity of 72% for pedophilia, 70% for hebephilia, and 75% for pedohebephilia and a specificity of 95%, 91%, and 91% for these paraphilias, respectively.

==== Circumferential penile plethysmography ====
Other studies have examined the sensitivity and specificity of circumferential phallometry to identify different sexual interests in children. Sensitivity for a circumferential phallometric test for pedophilia has been estimated to be 63% in sexual offenders against children, 65% in extrafamilial offenders against children and 68.4% in incest offenders. Additional research has found different circumferential phallometric tests to have a sensitivity of 93%, 96%, 35%, 78%, and 50% in sexual offenders against children. In incest offenders, the sensitivity of circumferential phallometric tests has been estimated as 19% and 60% in extrafamilial offenders against children. In terms of specificity of these tests for pedophilia, research has estimated the specificity as 92%, 82%, 76%, and 92% in samples of community males and 80% and 92% in sexual offenders against adults.

A single study has examined the accuracy of a circumferential phallometric test for hebephilia. This study found the sensitivity of the hebephilia test to be 70% in extrafamilial offenders against children and 52% in incest offenders. In addition, the specificity for this phallometric test was 68% in a sample of community males.

Other studies have found different phallometric tests for pedohebephilia to have a sensitivity of 75% in incest offenders, 67% in extrafamilial offenders against children, and 64%, 64%, 44%, and 53%, in sexual offenders against children.

In addition, Abel and colleagues found ephebophilic stimuli to have a sensitivity of 50%.

Another study examined the possibility that juvenile sex offenders might be able to suppress arousal deemed deviant. Of the juveniles who exhibited sexual arousal, categorization was made into two age appropriate categories—Adult and Peer responders—and three age inappropriate categories—Child, Child/Adult, and Nondiscriminating responders—based on whether they had the greatest sexual arousal in response to adult female, peer female, or younger child female stimuli. Sexual arousal in response to older adult women or peers was deemed age appropriate; sexual arousal in response to significantly younger females was deemed inappropriate. Many of the juveniles who denied responsibility for their offenses showed no sexual arousal at all—however about one-third still showed age inappropriate arousal despite denying responsibility for their offenses.

===Biastophilia===
There is some evidence that phallometry can distinguish groups of men with biastophilia (a paraphilia involving rape) from groups of men without it.

==Legal admissibility==
In general, phallometric test results are employed as part of the sentencing and rehabilitation phase of forensic systems, but &quot;not&quot; for determining whether a specific defendant is guilty of any specific offense against any specific person.

=== United States ===

====Use as trial evidence====
In the United States, a scientific technique could not be used as evidence in court unless the technique was &quot;generally accepted&quot; as reliable in the relevant scientific community. This was known as the Frye standard, adopted in 1923. In 1993, the doctrine was rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States in favor of a more comprehensive &quot;reliable foundation&quot; test in &quot;Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals&quot;. In the Daubert standard, the &quot;generally accepted&quot; test was no longer determinative. Several other factors could now be considered, including whether the technique had been published and peer-reviewed. Myers notes, &quot;Courts that have considered penile plethysmography generally rule that the technique is not sufficiently reliable for use in court.&quot;

In &quot;United States v. Powers&quot; the court excluded the penile plethysmograph test because it failed to qualify under Daubert&#x27;s scientific validity prong for two reasons: the scientific literature does not regard the test as a valid diagnostic tool, and &quot;a vast majority of incest offenders who do not admit their guilt, such as Powers, show a normal reaction to the test. The Government argues that such false negatives render the test unreliable.&quot;

According to Barker and Howell, penile plethysmography (PPG) does not meet the legal threshold for the guilt phase for the following reasons:
* No standardization
* Test results are not sufficiently accurate
* Results are subject to faking and voluntary control by test subjects
* High incidence of false negatives and false positives
* Results are open to interpretation

They concluded, &quot;Until a way can be devised to detect and/or control false negatives and false positives, the validity of the test data will be questionable.&quot; Responding to Barker and Howell, Simon and Schouten noted, &quot;Our own analysis suggests that the standardization and faking issues, as well as other problems not addressed in the Barker and Howell paper, warrant much more guarded conclusions about the use of the plethysmograph in legal and clinical settings.&quot; Prentky noted &quot;the increased likelihood in forensic settings that dissimulation may compromise the validity of the assessment.&quot; Hall and Crowther noted penile plethysmography &quot;may be even more problematic than other [methods] in assessing susceptibility of the test to faking.&quot;

In &quot;State of North Carolina v. Spencer&quot;, the court reviewed the literature and case law and concluded that penile plethysmography was scientifically unreliable: &quot;Despite the sophistication of the current equipment technology, a question remains whether the information emitted is a valid and reliable means of assessing sexual preference.&quot;

More recently, a substantial amount of research data has been gathered and reviewed, and significant steps have been taken toward standardization. According to researcher Gilles Launay, &quot;[T]he validity of the technique for research and clinical assessment is now established;&quot; it is only the use in guilt-determination proceedings that is inappropriate. Fedoroff and Moran called it an &quot;experimental procedure&quot; and noted, &quot;Virtually every expert who has written about phallometry has cautioned that it is insufficiently sensitive or specific to be used to determine the guilt or innocence of a person accused of a sex crime.&quot;

====Post-conviction use====
Phallometry is widely considered appropriate for treatment and supervision of convicted sex offenders: &quot;Courts have permitted plethysmographic testing for monitoring compliance by convicted sex offenders with the conditions of their community placement as part of crime-related treatment for sexual deviancy.&quot; Its use for the treatment and management of sexual offenders is recommended by the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers. Becker notes it &quot;should never be used exclusively in forensic decision making.&quot; The sexual assault trial of basketball player Kobe Bryant in Colorado brought this device and its use to public attention before the case was dropped in 2004, because Colorado law would have required evaluation with this device following conviction. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently addressed the procedures required before a federal supervised release program could include penile plethysmograph testing. The device is routinely used at civil commitment facilities, but &quot;some clinicians and offenders say it is easy, particularly in a laboratory, to stifle arousal and thus cheat on a plethysmograph test.&quot; This has been reported to occur in 16% of cases.

During the Catholic sex abuse cases, the reliability of the test was questioned by some officials in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Later, these officials chose to seek therapy at an institution where the plethysmograph was not used.

=== Canada ===

Courts in Canada came to a similar conclusion as those in the United States. The Supreme Court of Canada adopted the Daubert doctrine in &quot;R. v . J.-L.J.&quot; [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, which upheld a lower court&#x27;s decision to exclude testimony by a psychiatrist who had administered several tests on the accused, including a penile plethysmograph:

As of 2010, all youth in sex offender treatment programs administered by the Youth Forensic Psychiatric Service of British Columbia were offered a voluntary penile plethysmograph test to predict whether they can properly control their deviant arousal, or whether they will require medication or other forms of treatment. According to sceptics, however, the test does not reliably predict recurrent violations.

===Ethics and legality of use===
Robert Todd Carroll writes, &quot;More objectionable than the questionable scientific validity of the device, however, are the moral and legal questions its use raises.&quot; Carroll and others cite the legality of the depictions of minors, as well as the constitutionality of requiring PPG for admission to jobs or the military, or in custody cases. In &quot;Harrington v. Almy&quot; the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit found that a PPG ordered to be administered by William O&#x27;Donohue as a precondition of employment was a violation of plaintiff&#x27;s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In a 2009 report led by Robert Clift on use of the device on adolescent offenders, the authors acknowledge in their conclusions that PPG tests &quot;are problematic ethically and should be used only after therapists have carefully weighed the benefits versus the negatives.&quot; The Minister of Children and Family Development closed the program examined in Clift&#x27;s report in 2010 following complaints by civil rights groups. The principal manufacturer of the device stopped making them in the 1990s.

The EU&#x27;s leading human rights agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency, has criticised the use of phallometric tests by the Czech Republic to determine whether asylum seekers presenting themselves as homosexual were in fact gay. According to the Agency, the Czech Republic was in 2010 the only EU country to employ a sexual arousal test, which the Agency said could violate the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2011 the EU commission issued a statement calling the Czech practice illegal, saying &quot;The practice of phallometric tests constitutes a strong interference with the person&#x27;s private life and human dignity. This kind of degrading treatment should not be accepted in the European Union, nor elsewhere.&quot; The Czech Interior Ministry replied that the testing was conducted only after written consent has been obtained, and when it was not possible to use a different method of verification. According to the Ministry, all those who had passed the test had been granted asylum.
