<text>UCCEL Corp, previously called University Computing Company (&quot;UCC&quot;), was a data processing service bureau on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. It was founded by the Wyly brothers (Sam and Charles, Jr.) in 1963. The name change in the mid-1980s was brought about by Gregory Liemandt, placed as CEO by the majority stockholder, a Swiss citizen named Walter Haefner through Careal Holding AG of Zürich. By 1972, the company operated a middle-sized datacenter in Troy, Michigan, and a huge facility in Arlington, Texas, based on top-of-the-line IBM/360 (and later IBM/370) processors.

Uccel&#x27;s &quot;big-ticket item&quot; claim to fame was software called UCC-1/TMS (Tape Management System), an IBM mainframe product for managing the tape library in an OS/MVS operating system environment. In 1980, they developed their second &quot;big hitter&quot; and most profitable product, UCC-7 (job scheduler). The UCC-1, UCC-7, UCC-11 (batch job rerun/restart add-on) suite led the market for tape management and job scheduling.

In 1986, UCCEL Corporation purchased Cambridge Systems Group, Inc., which marketed for SKK, Inc. and their market-leading ACF2 mainframe security product. In June 1987, Uccel was unexpectedly bought out by its archrival, Computer Associates, which aggressively sold directly competing products CA-Dynam/TLMS (tape management), CA-Scheduler and batch job scheduling products originally from Capex Corporation (flagship products &quot;Optimizer&quot; and &quot;TLMS&quot;) and Value Software, plus CA-Top Secret (security / mainframe discretionary access control).

<text>The Church of God (Huntsville, Alabama) is a Holiness Pentecostal body of Christians, formerly based in Huntsville, Alabama.

The Church of God (Huntsville, Alabama) shares a common history with the Church of God of Prophecy (COGOP) up until their division in 1943. The original Church of God was led by Ambrose Jessup Tomlinson (1865-1943) until his death. The leaders of the church determined to install Milton A. Tomlinson as the General Overseer of the church. Milton&#x27;s brother, Homer Aubrey Tomlinson, withdrew and established church headquarters in Queens Village, Queens. After the death of Homer Tomlinson, Voy M. Bullen was chosen as his successor and headquarters were moved to Huntsville, Alabama, closer to the center of the movement. Bishop Bullen chose Danny R. Patrick as his successor, prior to his death in 1997. Bishop Patrick moved headquarters yet again, to his hometown of Scottville, Kentucky. He is the pastor of the largest church in the organization, East Willow Street Church of God. This group calls itself The Church of God, though &quot;World Headquarters&quot; is sometimes added for clarification. In 2016 Bishop Danny R. Patrick chose Roger L. Centers as the new General Overseer. 

The &quot;Handbook of Denominations&quot; reported 75,890 members for this group in 1978. Piepkorn&#x27;s &quot;Profiles in Belief&quot; reported 1933 congregations in the United States with 75,290 members. By most accounts this figure is highly inflated. 

A recent division brought into existence The Church of God in Divine Order, which was organized October 14, 2000, led by Ted Carr who disagreed with the decision to appoint Patrick as General Overseer. The group is headquartered in Sand Springs, Oklahoma.

<text>was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II who was War Minister during the surrender of Japan.

==Early life and career==
Anami was born in Taketa city in Ōita Prefecture, where his father was a senior bureaucrat in the Home Ministry and grew up in Tokyo and in Tokushima Prefecture. He attended the 18th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Infantry in December 1906.

In November 1918, Anami graduated from the 30th class of the Army Staff College with the rank of captain. He was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from April 1919 and was promoted to major in February 1922. From August 1923 to May 1925, he was assigned to the staff of the Sakhalin Expeditionary Army, which was responsible for the occupation of northern Sakhalin island during the Japanese intervention in Siberia. Anami was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1925.

From August to December 1925, Anami was sent as a military attaché to France. On his return to Japan, he was assigned to the 45th Infantry Regiment, and became unit commander in August 1928.

From August 1929 to August 1930, Anami served as Aide-de-camp to Emperor Hirohito. He was then promoted to colonel.

From August 1933 to August 1934, Anami served as regimental commander of the 2nd Guard Regiment of the Imperial Guards. He was subsequently Commandant of the Tokyo Military Preparatory School, and promoted to major general in March 1935.

==Wartime military career==

From August 1936, Anami served as Chief of the Military Administration Bureau of the War Ministry. He became Chief of the Personnel Bureau in March 1937 and was promoted to lieutenant general in March the following year.

With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Anami was given a combat command, as commanding officer of the 109th Division in China from November 1938. He was recalled to Japan in October 1939 to assume the role of Vice-Minister of War in the cabinet of Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Anami belonged to the clique which supported the rise of Hideki Tojo to power in October 1941.

However, in April 1941, Anami returned to China as Commander in Chief of the 11th Army, covering ongoing operations in central China. He was transferred to the Japanese Second Area Army in Manchukuo in July 1942.

In May 1943, Anami was promoted to full general. As the war conditions in the Pacific deteriorated for the Japanese, the Second Area Army was reassigned to the Southern Theater from November 1943, where Anami directed operations in western New Guinea and Halmahera.

Anami was recalled to Japan December 1944 and became Inspector General of Army Aviation and Chief of the Army Aeronautical Department and concurrently served on the Supreme War Council. In April 1945, he was appointed War Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki.

==Political career==
As War Minister, Anami was outspoken against the idea of surrender, despite his awareness that Japan&#x27;s losses on the battlefield and the destruction of Japan&#x27;s cities and industrial capability by American bombing meant that Japan had lost the war militarily. Even after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Anami opposed acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration and instead called for a large-scale battle to be fought on the Japanese mainland that would cause such massive Allied casualties that Japan would somehow be able to avoid complete surrender and perhaps even keep some of what it had conquered.

Eventually, his arguments against what he perceived to be the dishonor of surrender were overcome when Emperor Hirohito ordered an end to the war. Anami&#x27;s supporters suggested that he should vote against surrender or resign from the Cabinet. Instead, he ordered his officers to concede and later said to his brother-in-law, &quot;As a Japanese soldier, I must obey my Emperor.&quot;

He informed the officers of the War Ministry of the decision and that as it was an imperial command, they must obey. His refusal to support any action against the imperial decision was a key point in the failure of the Kyūjō incident, an attempted military coup d&#x27;état by junior officers to prevent the surrender announcement from being broadcast.

On 14 August, Anami signed the surrender document with the rest of the cabinet and committed &quot;seppuku&quot; early the next morning. His suicide note read, . The cryptic note is open to multiple interpretations.

Anami&#x27;s grave is at Tama Cemetery, in Fuchū, Tokyo. His sword, blood-splattered dress uniform, and suicide note are on display at the Yūshūkan Museum, next to Yasukuni Shrine, in Tokyo.

==Family==
Anami&#x27;s son Anami Koreshige served as Japan&#x27;s ambassador to China from 2001 to 2006.

<text>Dirk Werner Nowitzki (, ; born June 19, 1978) is a German former professional basketball player who is a special advisor for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Listed at , he is widely regarded as one of the greatest power forwards of all time and is considered by many to be the greatest European player of all time. In 2021, he was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. In 2023, Nowitzki was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

An alumnus of the DJK Würzburg basketball club, Nowitzki was chosen as the ninth pick in the 1998 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks and was immediately traded to the Dallas Mavericks, where he played his entire 21-year NBA career. Nowitzki led the Mavericks to 15 NBA playoff appearances (2001–2012; 2014–2016), including the franchise&#x27;s first NBA Finals appearance in 2006 and its only NBA championship in 2011. Known for his scoring ability, versatility, accurate outside shooting, and trademark one-legged fadeaway jump shot, Nowitzki won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2007 and the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in 2011.

Nowitzki is the only player ever to play for a single NBA franchise for 21 seasons. He is a 14-time All-Star, a 12-time All-NBA Team member, the first European player to start in an All-Star Game, and the first European player to receive the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. Nowitzki is the highest-scoring foreign-born player in NBA history. He is the first Maverick voted onto an All-NBA Team and holds several all-time Mavericks franchise records. On December 10, 2012, he became the first non-American player to receive the Naismith Legacy Award. Following his retirement, Nowitzki stood sixth on the NBA all-time scoring list.

In international play, Nowitzki led the Germany national team to a bronze medal in the 2002 FIBA World Championship and silver in EuroBasket 2005, and was the leading scorer and MVP in both tournaments. He is also the first German men&#x27;s player to have his number retired, receiving this honor in September 2022.

==Early life==
Born in Würzburg, Germany, Dirk Werner Nowitzki comes from an athletic family: his mother Helga Nowitzki (née Bredenbröcker) was a professional basketball player and his father Jörg-Werner was a handball player who represented Germany at the highest international level. Helga was a member of the West Germany national team that participated at the 1966 EuroBasket Women. His older sister Silke Nowitzki, a local champion in track and field, also became a basketball player and now works for the NBA in International TV.

Nowitzki was a very tall child; most of the time he stood above his peers by a foot or more. He initially played handball and tennis. He managed to become a ranked junior tennis player in the German youth circuit, but soon grew tired of being called a &quot;freak&quot; for his height and eventually turned to basketball. Watching the 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball &quot;Dream Team&quot; also caused Nowitzki to gravitate towards basketball. After joining the local DJK Würzburg, the 15-year-old attracted the attention of former German international basketball player Holger Geschwindner, who spotted his talent immediately and offered to coach him individually two to three times per week. After getting both the approval of Nowitzki and his parents, Geschwindner put his student through an unorthodox training scheme: he emphasized shooting and passing exercises, and shunned weight training and tactical drills, because he felt it was &quot;unnecessary friction&quot;. Furthermore, Geschwindner encouraged Nowitzki to play a musical instrument and read literature to make him a more complete personality.

After a year, the coach was so impressed with Nowitzki&#x27;s progress that he advised him, &quot;You must now decide whether you want to play against the best in the world or just stay a local hero in Germany. If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent that anymore. But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis.&quot; After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.

==Professional career==
===DJK Würzburg (1994–1998)===
When Nowitzki joined the team, DJK played in Germany&#x27;s second-tier level league, the Second Bundesliga, South Division. His first trainer was Pit Stahl, who played the tall teenager as an outside-scoring forward rather than an inside-scoring center to utilise his shooting skills. In the 1994–95 Second Bundesliga season, ambitious DJK finished as a disappointing sixth of 12 teams; the rookie Nowitzki was often benched and struggled with bad school grades, which forced him to study rather than work on his game. In the next 1995–96 Second Bundesliga season, Nowitzki established himself as a starter next to Finnish star forward Martti Kuisma and soon became a regular double-digit scorer: after German national basketball coach Dirk Bauermann saw him score 24 points in a DJK game, he stated that &quot;Dirk Nowitzki is the greatest German basketball talent of the last 10, maybe 15 years.&quot;

In the 1996–97 Second Bundesliga season, Nowitzki averaged 19.4 points per game and led DJK again to second place after the regular season, but could not help his team gain promotion. In the following 1997–98 Second Bundesliga season, Nowitzki finished his &quot;Abitur&quot; (German A-levels), but had to do compulsory military service in the Bundeswehr which lasted from September 1, 1997, to June 30, 1998. The 18-year-old, who had grown to tall, made progress, leading DJK to a 36:4-point total (in Germany, a victory gives 2:0 points and a loss 0:2) and ending as leading scorer with 28.2 points per game. In the promotion playoffs, DJK finally broke its hex, finishing at first place with 14:2 points and earning promotion to the next higher league; Nowitzki was voted &quot;German Basketballer of the Year&quot; by the German BASKET magazine.

Abroad, Nowitzki&#x27;s progress was noticed. A year later, the teenager participated in the Nike &quot;Hoop Heroes Tour&quot;, where he played against NBA stars like Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen. In a 30-minute show match, Nowitzki outplayed Barkley and even dunked on him, causing the latter to exclaim: &quot;The boy is a genius. If he wants to enter the NBA, he can call me.&quot; On March 29, 1998, Nowitzki was chosen to play in the Nike Hoop Summit, one of the premier talent watches in U.S. men&#x27;s basketball. In a match between the U.S. talents and the international talents, Nowitzki scored 33 points on 6-of-12 shooting, 14 rebounds and 3 steals for the internationals and outplayed future US NBA players Rashard Lewis and Al Harrington. He impressed with a combination of quickness, ball handling, and shooting range, and from that moment a multitude of European and NBA clubs wanted to recruit him.

===Dallas Mavericks (1998–2019)===
====Difficult start (1998–1999)====
Projected to be the seventh pick in the 1998 NBA draft, Nowitzki passed up many college offers and went directly into the NBA as a prep-to-pro player. The Milwaukee Bucks selected Nowitzki with the ninth pick in the draft and traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in a multi-team deal; future star point guard Steve Nash came to Dallas in the same trade. Nowitzki and Nash quickly became close friends. Nowitzki became only the fourth German player in NBA history, following pivots Uwe Blab and Christian Welp and All-Star swingman Detlef Schrempf, who was a 35-year-old veteran of the Seattle SuperSonics when his young compatriot arrived. Nowitzki finished his DJK career as the only Würzburg player to have ever made the NBA.

In Dallas, Nowitzki joined a franchise which had last made the playoffs in 1990. Shooting guard Michael Finley captained the squad, supported by center Shawn Bradley (once a number two draft pick) and team scoring leader Cedric Ceballos, an ex-Laker forward. The start of the season was delayed by the 1998–99 NBA lockout, which put the entire season in jeopardy. In limbo, Nowitzki returned to DJK Würzburg and played thirteen games before both sides worked out a late compromise deal that resulted in a shortened NBA schedule of only 50 games. When the season finally started, Nowitzki struggled. Played as a power forward by coach Don Nelson, the 20-year-old felt overpowered by the more athletic NBA forwards, was intimidated by the expectations as a number nine pick, and played bad defense; hecklers taunted him as &quot;Irk Nowitzki&quot;, omitting the &quot;D&quot; which stands for &quot;defense&quot; in basketball slang. He only averaged 8.2 points and 3.4 rebounds in 20.4 minutes of playing time. Looking back, Nowitzki said: &quot;I was so frustrated I even contemplated going back to Germany... [the jump from Second Bundesliga to the NBA] was like jumping out of an airplane hoping the parachute would somehow open.&quot; The Mavericks only won 19 of their 50 games and missed the playoffs.

====&quot;Big Three&quot; era (1999–2004)====
=====1999–00 season: Improving as a sophomore=====
On January 4, 2000, team owner Ross Perot Jr. sold the Mavericks to Internet billionaire Mark Cuban for $280 million. Cuban quickly invested into the Mavericks and restructured the franchise, attending every game at the sidelines, buying the team a $46 million Boeing 757 to travel in, and increasing franchise revenues to over $100 million. Nowitzki lauded Cuban, stating that he &quot;created the perfect environment... we only have to go out and win.&quot; As a result of Nelson&#x27;s tutelage, Cuban&#x27;s improvements and his own progress, Nowitzki significantly improved in his second season. Nowitzki averaged 17.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game in 35.8 minutes. He was voted runner-up in the NBA Most Improved Player Award behind Jalen Rose, and made it into the NBA All-Star Sophomore squad. The Nowitzki also was chosen for the Three-Point Contest, becoming the tallest player ever to participate. While he improved on an individual level, the Mavericks missed the playoffs after a mediocre 40–42 season.

=====2000–01 season: First All-NBA and playoff appearances=====
In the 2000–01 NBA season, Nowitzki further improved his averages, recording 21.8 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game. As a sign of his growing importance, he joined team captain Finley as only one of two Mavericks to play and start in all 82 games, and had 10 games in which he scored at least 30 points. Nowitzki became the first Maverick ever to be voted into the All-NBA squads, making the Third Team. In addition, his best friend Nash became a valuable point guard, and with Finley scoring more than ever, pundits took to calling this trio the &quot;Big Three&quot; of the Mavericks.

Posting a 53–29 record in the regular season, the Mavericks reached the playoffs for the first time since 1990. As the fifth seed, they were paired against the Utah Jazz, who were led by point guard John Stockton and power forward Karl Malone. The Mavericks won the series in five games, setting up a meeting with their Texas rivals, the San Antonio Spurs. The Mavericks lost the first three games of the series, and Nowitzki fell ill with the flu and later lost a tooth after a collision with Spurs guard Terry Porter. After a Game 4 win, Nowitzki scored 42 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in Game 5, but could not prevent a deciding 105–87 loss.

=====2001–02 season: First All-Star selection=====
Prior to the 2001–02 NBA season, Nowitzki signed a six-year, $90 million contract extension, which made him the second-highest-paid German athlete after Formula One champion Michael Schumacher. He continued to improve, averaging 23.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. Nowitzki was voted into the All-NBA Second Team and into his first All-Star Game. After making the playoffs with a 57–25 record, the Mavericks swept Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round; Nowitzki averaged 33.3 points per game. In the second round, the Mavericks met the Sacramento Kings and rival power forward Chris Webber. After splitting the first two games, Kings coach Rick Adelman changed his defensive scheme, assigning Hedo Türkoğlu to cover Nowitzki. Türkoğlu would use his agility to play Nowitzki tightly, and if the taller Maverick tried to post up Türkoğlu, Webber would double team Nowitzki. In Game 3 in Dallas, the Mavericks lost, 125–119; Nowitzki scored only 19 points and said: &quot;I simply could not pass Türkoğlu, and if I did, I ran into a double team and committed too many turnovers.&quot; In Game 4, Nowitzki missed two potentially game-deciding jump shots, and the Mavericks lost, 115–113, at home. In Game 5, the Mavericks were eliminated, 114–101. However, Nowitzki received a consolation award: the &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; voted him as &quot;European Basketballer of the Year&quot;, his 104 votes lifting him over second-placed Dejan Bodiroga (54) and Stojakovic (50).

=====2002–03 season: First Western Conference Finals appearance=====
Before the 2002–03 NBA season, Don Nelson and Mark Cuban put more emphasis on defense, specializing in a zone anchored by prolific shotblockers Raef LaFrentz and Shawn Bradley. The Mavericks won their first fourteen games, and Finley, Nash and Nowitzki were voted &quot;Western Conference Players of the Month&quot; in November 2002. In that season, Nowitzki lifted his averages again, now scoring 25.1 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game. He led the Mavericks to a franchise-high 60–22 record, which earned them the third seed: as a result, the Mavericks had to play sixth seed Portland Trail Blazers in the 2003 NBA Playoffs. Now playing in a best-of-seven series instead of the former best-of-five, the Mavericks quickly won the first three games, but then completely lost their rhythm and the next three. In Game 7, Nowitzki hit a clutch three to make it 100–94 with 1:21 left and the Mavericks won 107–95. &quot;This was the most important basket of my career&quot;, he later said, &quot;I was not prepared to go on vacation that early.&quot; In the next round, the Mavericks met the Kings again, and the series went seven games. Nowitzki delivered a clutch performance in Game 7; he scored 30 points, grabbed 19 rebounds, and played strong defense, leading the Mavericks to a series-deciding 112–99 win. In the Western Conference Finals, the Mavericks met the Spurs again. In Game 3, Nowitzki went up for a rebound and Spurs guard Manu Ginóbili collided with his knee, forcing him out of the series. Without their top scorer, the Mavericks ultimately lost in six games.

=====2003–04 season: Playoff disappointment=====
After Dallas traded starting center Raef LaFrentz to Boston for forward Antoine Walker, Nelson decided to start Nowitzki at center. To cope with his more physical role, Nowitzki put on of muscle mass over summer, sacrificed part of his agility, and put more emphasis on defense rather than scoring. Nowitzki&#x27;s averages fell for the first time in his career, dropping to 21.8 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game, but he still led the Mavericks in scoring, rebounding, steals (1.2 spg) and blocks (1.35 bpg). These figures earned him nominations for the All-Star Game and the All-NBA Third Team. Compiling a 52–30 record, the Mavericks met their familiar rivals the Sacramento Kings in the playoffs once again, but were eliminated in five games.

====Franchise player (2004–2010)====
=====2004–05 season: First All-NBA First Team selection=====
Before the 2004–05 NBA season, the Mavericks were re-tooled again. Center Erick Dampier was acquired from the Golden State Warriors in an eight-player trade. Also, Nowitzki&#x27;s close friend and fellow international teammate Steve Nash left Dallas and returned to the Phoenix Suns as a free agent, going on to win two Most Valuable Player awards with the Suns. During the season, long-time head coach Don Nelson resigned, and his assistant Avery Johnson took on head coaching duties. In the midst of these changes, Nowitzki stepped up his game and averaged 26.1 points a game (a career high) and 9.7 rebounds; and his 1.5 blocks and 3.1 assists were also career-high numbers. On December 2, 2004, Nowitzki scored 53 points in an overtime win against the Houston Rockets, a career best. Nowitzki was voted to the All-NBA First Team for the first time. He also placed third in the league&#x27;s MVP voting, behind Nash and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

However, the Mavericks had a subpar 2005 NBA Playoffs campaign. In the first round, Dallas met Houston Rockets scoring champion Tracy McGrady and center Yao Ming. The Rockets took a 2–0 series lead before the Mavericks won three games in a row. After losing Game 6, Dallas won Game 7 convincingly and won the series even though Nowitzki struggled with his shooting. In the Western Conference Semi-finals, the Mavericks met the Phoenix Suns, the new club of Nash. They split the first four games before the Suns won the last two games. In Game 6, which the Mavericks lost in overtime, Nowitzki was not at his best: he scored 28 points, but also sank only 9 of his 25 field goal attempts and missed all five of his shots in overtime.

=====2005–06 season: First NBA Finals appearance=====
Prior to the 2005–06 NBA season, veteran Mavericks captain Michael Finley was waived, leaving Nowitzki as the last player remaining from the Mavericks&#x27; &quot;Big Three&quot; of Nash, Finley, and himself. Nowitzki averaged 26.6 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 2.8 assists during the season. Not only was this his third 2,000-point season, but his scoring average of 26.6 points was highest ever by a European. He improved his shooting percentage, setting personal season records in field goals (48.0%), three-point shots (40.6%) and free throws (90.1%). During the 2006 All-Star Weekend in Houston, Nowitzki scored 18 points to defeat Seattle SuperSonics guard Ray Allen and Washington Wizards guard Gilbert Arenas in the Three-Point Contest.

Nowitzki paced Dallas to a 60-win season. The team finished with the third-best record in the league behind the defending champion San Antonio Spurs and the defending Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons. As in the 2004–05 season, he finished third in the league&#x27;s MVP voting, this time behind Nash and LeBron James. He was again elected to the first team All-NBA squad. Nowitzki averaged 27.0 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 2.9 assists in the playoffs. In the opening round, the Mavericks swept the Memphis Grizzlies, 4–0, with Nowitzki making a clutch three-pointer in the closing seconds of Game 3 which tied the game and forced overtime. In the Western Conference Semi-finals, the Mavericks played against the San Antonio Spurs again. After splitting the first six games, the Mavericks took a 20-point lead in Game 7 before Spur Manu Ginóbili broke a tie at 101 by hitting a 3 with 30 seconds left. On the next play, Nowitzki completed a three-point play, which tied the game at 104. In the end, the Mavericks won, 119–111, and Nowitzki ended the game with 37 points and 15 rebounds. Nowitzki commented: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how the ball went in. Manu hit my hand. It was a lucky bounce.&quot; The Mavericks advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they again met the Suns. Nowitzki scored a playoff career high 50 points to lead the Mavericks to a victory in the crucial Game 5 with the series tied at 2; the Mavericks won the series in six games and faced the Miami Heat in the 2006 NBA Finals. A content Nowitzki commented: &quot;We&#x27;ve been a good road team all season long, we believed in each other. We went through some ups and downs this season, but the playoffs are all about showing heart and playing together.&quot; Of Nowitzki&#x27;s performance, ESPN columnist Bill Simmons wrote, &quot;Dirk is playing at a higher level than any forward since [Larry] Bird.&quot;

The Mavericks took an early 2–0 Finals lead, but then gave away a late 15-point lead in a Game 3 loss. Nowitzki only made 20 of his last 55 shots in the final three games as the Mavericks lost the Finals series, 4–2, to the Heat. The German was criticized by ESPN as &quot;clearly... not as his best this series&quot; and remarked: &quot;That was a tough loss (in Game 3) and that really changed the whole momentum of the series.&quot;

=====2006–07 season: NBA MVP and franchise record in wins=====
In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki shot a career-best 50.2% from the field, recorded averages of 24.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 3.4 assists, and led the Mavericks to a franchise-high 67 wins and the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference in the 2007 NBA Playoffs. He averaged 50% from the field, 40% for three-pointers, and 90% from the free-throw line, becoming (at the time) only the fifth player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club. Nowitzki was touted as the overwhelming favorite for the Most Valuable Player award and was expected to lead the Mavericks to an easy win against the eighth-seed Golden State Warriors, despite the Warriors having won all three regular-season meetings against Dallas. However, the Mavericks ended up losing to the Warriors in six games, marking the first time a No. 8 seed had beaten the No. 1 seed in a best-of-seven series in NBA history. In the clinching Game 6, Nowitzki shot just 2–13 from the field for only eight points. Defended by Stephen Jackson, Nowitzki averaged nearly five points less than his regular-season average in that series and shot 38.3% from the field as compared to 50.2% during the regular season. He described that loss as a low point in his career: &quot;This series, I couldn&#x27;t put my stamp on it the way I wanted to. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m very disappointed.&quot; In spite of this historic playoffs loss, Nowitzki was named the NBA&#x27;s regular-season Most Valuable Player and beat his friend and back-to-back NBA MVP Nash with more than 100 votes. He also became the first European player in NBA history to receive the honor.

=====2007–08 season: First triple-double=====

The 2007–08 campaign saw another first-round playoff exit for Nowitzki and the Mavericks. Despite a mid-season trade that brought veteran NBA All-Star Jason Kidd to Dallas, the Mavericks finished seventh in a highly competitive Western Conference. Nowitzki averaged 23.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a career-high 3.5 assists for the season. In the playoffs, they faced rising star Chris Paul&#x27;s New Orleans Hornets, and were eliminated in five games. The playoff loss led to the firing of Avery Johnson as head coach and the eventual hiring of Rick Carlisle. The few positive highlights that season for Nowitzki were his first career triple-double against the Milwaukee Bucks on February 6, 2008, with 29 points, 10 rebounds, and a career-high 12 assists, and on March 8, 2008 (34 points against the New Jersey Nets), when he surpassed Rolando Blackman with his 16,644th point to become the Mavericks&#x27; all-time career points leader.

=====2008–09 season: Playoff upset=====
The 2008–09 NBA season saw Nowitzki finish with averages of 25.9 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 2.4 assists. He was fourth in the league in scoring, and garnered his fourth All-NBA First Team selection. He also made the 2009 All-Star game, his eighth appearance. Nowitzki led Dallas to a tight finish towards the playoffs, finishing 50–32 for the season (6th in the West), after a slow 2–7 start. In the playoffs, the German led Dallas to an upset win over long-time rival San Antonio (the third seed), winning the first-round series, 4–1. The Mavericks, however, fell short against the Denver Nuggets, 4–1, in the second round, with Nowitzki averaging 34.4 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 4 assists in the series.

=====2009–10 season: 20,000 points=====
The Mavericks finished the 2009–10 NBA season as the second seed for the 2010 NBA Playoffs. Notable additions to the squad were multiple All-Stars Shawn Marion and Caron Butler, with the latter coming in the second half of the season. On January 13, 2010, Nowitzki became the 34th player in NBA history—and the first European—to hit the 20,000-point milestone, while ending the regular season with averages of 25 points, 7.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1 block. He was selected to the 2010 All-Star Game, his ninth appearance. The Mavericks faced off against San Antonio once more in the first round of the playoffs, but for the third time in four seasons, they failed to progress to the next round. Nowitzki became a free agent after the season, but signed a four-year, $80 million deal to remain in Dallas.

====Championship season (2010–2011)====

Prior to the 2010–11 season, the Mavericks traded for center Tyson Chandler. Nowitzki was injured in the middle of the season, but finished the regular season with averages of 23 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists. Despite missing nine games, Nowitzki was selected to the All-Star Game for the tenth time. The Mavericks defeated Portland in the first round of the playoffs and swept the two-time defending champion Lakers in the Conference Semifinals. In the Conference Finals, they faced the Oklahoma City Thunder and their All-NBA duo of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. In Game 1, Nowitzki scored 48 points and set an NBA record of 24 consecutive free throws made in a game as well as a record for most free throws in a game without a miss. In Game 4, with Dallas leading the series 2–1, Nowitzki scored 40 points to rally his team from a 99–84 fourth-quarter deficit to a 112–105 overtime victory. Dallas won the Western Conference title in Game Five.

In the 2011 NBA Finals, Dallas once again faced the Miami Heat, which had acquired All-Stars LeBron James and Chris Bosh before the season began. During a Game 1 loss in Miami, Nowitzki tore a tendon in his left middle finger; however, MRIs were negative, and Nowitzki vowed that the injury would not be a factor. In Game 2, he led a Dallas rally from an 88–73 fourth-quarter deficit, making a driving left-handed layup over Bosh to tie the series at 1. Miami took a 2–1 series lead after Nowitzki missed a potential game-tying shot at the end of Game 3. Despite carrying a fever in Game 4, he hit the winning basket to tie the series yet again at 2, evoking comparisons to Michael Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Flu Game&quot; against Utah in the 1997 NBA Finals. Dallas went on to win the next two games, with Nowitzki scoring 10 fourth-quarter points in the series-clinching game in Miami. The championship was the first in the history of the franchise. Nowitzki was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player.

===Post-championship and final years (2011–2019)===
====2011–12 season: Naismith Legacy Award====
As Dallas celebrated their title, the NBA was in a lockout that ended on December 8, 2011. The defending champions lost core players, such as DeShawn Stevenson, J. J. Barea, Peja Stojaković, and Tyson Chandler, while adding Lamar Odom, Delonte West, and veteran all-star Vince Carter in free agency. The Mavericks played only two preseason games, which led to a slow start for Nowitzki. Nowitzki made his 11th straight All-Star game appearance in Orlando. Nowitzki led his team in scoring 45 times during the season. Nowitzki&#x27;s streak of 11 seasons with 1,500 points came to an end after scoring 1,342 in the shortened NBA season. Dallas clinched the seventh spot in the West, and were matched against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2012 NBA Playoffs. The Thunder swept the Mavericks in four games.

====2012–13 season: Surgery and missing playoffs====

Before the season, Jason Kidd and Jason Terry left the Mavericks in free agency. Nowitzki underwent knee surgery in October 2012 and missed the first 27 games of the season. He returned on December 23, 2012, in a game against San Antonio. In January 2013, Nowitzki and some of his teammates made a pact not to shave their beards until the team reached .500. They were often called &quot;The Beard Bros.&quot; On April 14, 2013, after a fadeaway jumper in a game against the New Orleans Hornets, Nowitzki became the 17th player in NBA history to score 25,000 points. The Mavs went on to win the game and climbed back to .500 with a 40–40 record, and Nowitzki shaved his beard. However the Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since Nowitzki&#x27;s second season, ending their 12-year playoff streak.

====2013–14 season: Magic Johnson Award====
On January 29, 2014, Nowitzki scored his 26,000th point in a 115–117 loss to the Houston Rockets. In 35 minutes of play, he recorded 38 points, 17 rebounds, and 3 assists. On March 12, 2014, in a 108–101 victory over the Utah Jazz, Nowitzki finished the game with 31 points and passed John Havlicek on the NBA scoring list with 26,426 points. On April 8, 2014, Nowitzki scored his 26,712th point, passing Oscar Robertson to move to the 10th position on the all-time scoring list. Nowitzki led the Mavericks back to the playoffs where they faced their in-state rival San Antonio Spurs in the first round. Dallas lost the series in seven games, and the Spurs went on to win the NBA championship.

====2014–15 season: 10,000 rebounds====
On July 15, 2014, Nowitzki re-signed with the Mavericks to a reported three-year, $25 million contract. He was also reunited with former championship teammate Tyson Chandler, who was traded to Dallas after a three-year stint with New York. However, longtime teammate Shawn Marion signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers before the season.

On November 11, 2014, Nowitzki scored 23 points to surpass Hakeem Olajuwon as the highest-scoring player born outside the United States, as the Mavericks came from 24 points down to defeat Sacramento, 106–98. Nowitzki hit a jumper from just inside the three-point line early in the fourth quarter to pass Olajuwon at No. 9, and he finished the night at 26,953 career points. Six days later, Nowitzki became the fourth player in NBA history to eclipse 27,000 career points with the same franchise, joining Michael Jordan, Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant. On December 26 against the Los Angeles Lakers, Nowitzki passed Elvin Hayes for eighth place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list. He went on to pass Moses Malone for seventh place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list on January 5, 2015, in a 96–88 overtime win over the Brooklyn Nets. He recorded his 10,000th career rebound on March 24 against the San Antonio Spurs, and scored his 28,000th career point on April 1 against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

The Mavericks finished the regular season as the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference with a record of 50–32. They faced the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs and lost the series in five games.

====2015–16 season: Final playoff appearance====
On November 11, 2015, Nowitzki scored a season-high 31 points in a 118–108 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. He also grabbed a team-high 11 rebounds and passed former teammate Shawn Marion for 15th on the all-time career rebounding list. On December 23, Nowitzki moved past Shaquille O&#x27;Neal into sixth place on the NBA&#x27;s career scoring list, then made the go-ahead basket with 19.2 seconds left in overtime to help the Mavericks defeat the Brooklyn Nets, 119–118. On February 21, he scored 18 points against the Philadelphia 76ers, becoming the sixth player in NBA history to reach 29,000 career points. On March 20, he set a new season high with 40 points in a 132–120 overtime win over the Portland Trail Blazers. His 20th career 40-point game was his first since January 2014, and the first by a 37-year-old since Karl Malone in 2000–01.

In Game 4 of the Mavericks&#x27; first-round playoff series against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Nowitzki passed Elgin Baylor (3,623 points) for 15th on the NBA&#x27;s career playoff scoring list. The Mavericks lost the series four games to one.

====2016–17 season: NBA Teammate of the Year and 30,000 points====
On July 27, 2016, Nowitzki re-signed with the Mavericks. Nowitzki missed several games early in the season with Achilles tendon problems. On March 7, 2017, in a 122–111 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Nowitzki became the sixth player in NBA history to score 30,000 regular-season points. He also became the first international player to reach the milestone and one of only three to score all 30,000-plus with one team—the others being Karl Malone (Utah Jazz) and Kobe Bryant (L.A. Lakers). The Mavericks finished the season with a 33–49 record and missed the NBA Playoffs.

Following the 2016–17 season, Nowitzki exercised his player option to become a free agent; this move allowed the Mavericks to re-sign him with less money and be able to pursue other free agents.

====2017–18 season: Season-ending surgery====
On July 6, 2017, Nowitzki re-signed with the Mavericks on a two-year, $10 million contract (with a team option on the second year). On February 5, 2018, in a 104–101 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, Nowitzki became the sixth player in NBA history to reach 50,000 career minutes. On February 28, 2018, in a 111–110 overtime loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, Nowitzki reached 31,000 career points. On March 17, 2018, in a 114–106 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, Nowitzki played in his 1,463rd game, moving past Kevin Garnett into fifth place in the NBA career list. He had season-ending ankle surgery on April 5 after appearing in 77 of the first 78 games. The Mavericks finished the season with a 24–58 record and missed the NBA Playoffs.

====2018–19 season: Final season====
On July 23, 2018, Nowitzki re-signed with the Mavericks for the 2018–19 season. With his season debut on December 13, 2018, he set the NBA record for the most seasons played with the same team (21), breaking a tie with Kobe Bryant, who spent 20 seasons with the Lakers. He also became the fifth player in NBA history to play 21 seasons, tying an NBA record. Nowitzki was named to his 14th All-Star game as a special team roster addition. On March 18, 2019, Nowitzki became the sixth-highest scoring player of all time, surpassing Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s 31,419 points in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. In his team&#x27;s final home game of the season, a 120–109 victory over the Phoenix Suns on April 9, Nowitzki scored 30 points, and announced his retirement in an emotional ceremony during which Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Shawn Kemp, Scottie Pippen, and Detlef Schrempf appeared on the court to give laudatory speeches for Nowitzki. One day later, he played his final NBA game, recording a double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds in a 105–94 loss to the Spurs.

==National team career==

Nowitzki began playing for the German national basketball team in 1997. In his debut tournament, the EuroBasket 1999, the 21-year-old rookie emerged as the main German scorer, but Germany finished seventh and failed to qualify for the 2000 Olympic Games. In the EuroBasket 2001, Nowitzki was top scorer with 28.7 points per game, and narrowly lost the MVP vote to Serbian player Peja Stojaković. Germany reached the semi-finals and were close to beating host nation Turkey, but Hedo Türkoğlu hit a three-point buzzer beater to tie it, and the Turks eventually won in overtime. Germany then lost, 99–90, against Spain, and did not win a medal. However, with averages of 28.7 points and 9.1 rebounds, Nowitzki led the tournament in both statistics, and was voted to the All-Star team. Back home, the German basketball team attracted up to 3.7 million television viewers, a German basketball record at the time.

Nowitzki earned his first medal when he led Germany to a bronze medal in the 2002 FIBA World Championship. In the quarter-finals against the Pau Gasol-led Spain, Spain was up 52–46 after three-quarters, but then Nowitzki scored 10 points in the last quarter and led Germany to a 70–62 win. In the semi-finals, his team played against the Argentinian team led by Manu Ginóbili, but despite leading, 74–69, four minutes from the end and despite Argentina losing Ginobili to a foot injury, the South Americans won, 86–80. However, the Germans won 117–94 against New Zealand in the consolation finals and won bronze, and Nowitzki, as the tournament&#x27;s top scorer, (24.0 points per game), was elected the tournament MVP. Back in Germany, over four million television viewers followed the games, an all-time record in German basketball history.

In a preparation game for EuroBasket 2003, Nowitzki suffered a foot injury after a collision with French player Florent Piétrus; as a result, Nowitzki played inconsistently and was also often target of hard fouls. In the decisive second-round match against Italy (only the winner was allowed to play the medal round), Germany lost, 86–84, finished ninth and did not qualify for the 2004 Olympic Games. Nowitzki scored 22.5 points per game (third overall), but in general seemed to lack focus and dominance due to his injury.

In the EuroBasket 2005, Nowitzki led a depleted German squad into the Finals, beating title favorites Slovenia in the quarter-finals and Spain in the semi-finals on the way. EuroBasket pundits praised Nowitzki in both matches: against Slovenia (76–62), the forward scored a game-high 22 points and commented: &quot;The Slovenians underestimated us. They said we were the team they wanted and that was wrong, you shouldn&#x27;t do that in the quarter-finals.&quot; Against Spain (74–73), Nowitzki scored a game-high 27 points and scored the decisive basket: down by one and with only a few seconds to go, he drove on Spanish forward Jorge Garbajosa, and hit a baseline jump shot over Garbajosa&#x27;s outstretched arms with 3.9 seconds to go. The German later commented: &quot;It was indescribable. Garbajosa kind of pushed me towards the baseline so I just went with it.&quot; Despite losing the Finals, 78–62, to the Greeks, Nowitzki was the tournament&#x27;s leading scorer (26.1 per game), and second-leading rebounder (10.6 per game), and shot blocker (1.9 per game), and he was also voted the Most Valuable Player of the tournament. When he was subbed out towards the end of the final, Nowitzki received a standing ovation from the crowd, which he later recalled as &quot;one of the best moments of [his] career&quot;. The German team was awarded a silver medal.

In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, Nowitzki led the German team to an eighth place and commented: &quot;It&#x27;s tough luck. But overall, finishing eighth in the world is not bad.&quot;
In the EuroBasket 2007, in which the top three teams automatically qualified for the 2008 Olympics, Nowitzki led Germany to a fifth place. He was the leading scorer with 24.0 points per game. The fifth place meant that Germany fell short of direct qualification, but was allowed to participate in the 2008 Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Nowitzki led Germany into a decisive match against Puerto Rico for the last remaining slot. In that crucial match, he scored a game-high 32 points and was vital for the 96–82 win which sent the German basketball team to their first Olympics since the 1992 Summer Olympics. Nowitzki was chosen to be the flag bearer for the German Olympic Team at the Opening Ceremony for the 2008 Olympics. Nowitzki led the German team to a tenth-place finish, and averaged 17.0 points and 8.4 rebounds for the tournament.

In 2009, Nowitzki skipped the EuroBasket 2009. In July 2010, he said that he would skip the 2010 FIBA World Championship. In summer 2011, Nowitzki played with Germany in the EuroBasket 2011, where the team reached ninth place. In 2015, Nowitzki captained Germany at the EuroBasket. They won only one game, and were eliminated in the group stage, on home soil. In January 2016, Nowitzki officially announced his retirement from Germany&#x27;s national team. In his career with Germany&#x27;s senior men&#x27;s national team, he averaged 19.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game.

Nowitzki was named the Euroscar European Basketball Player of the Year by the Italian sports newspaper &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; for five years running from 2002 to 2006 and again in 2011. He was also named the Mister Europa European Player of the Year by the Italian sports magazine &quot;Superbasket&quot; in 2005, and the FIBA Europe Men&#x27;s Player of the Year twice in 2005 and 2011. He was named to the FIBA EuroBasket 2000–2020 Dream Team in 2020.

The German Basketball Federation (DBB) honored Nowitzki with a jersey (number 14) retirement in September 2022, ahead of EuroBasket 2022. The ceremony was held on September 2, immediately before Germany&#x27;s EuroBasket opening game against France in Cologne. DBB also announced that a replica of Nowitzki&#x27;s national team jersey would hang from the arena rafters at all future Germany men&#x27;s home games.

==Player profile==

Nowitzki was a versatile frontcourt player who mostly played the power forward, but also played center and small forward in his career. An exceptional shooter for his size, Nowitzki made 88% of his free throws, nearly 50% of his field goal attempts and nearly 40% of his 3-point shots, and won the 2006 NBA All-Star Three-Point Contest. In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA&#x27;s 50–40–90 Club for players who shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better on three-pointers, and 90% or better on free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category.

Nowitzki&#x27;s shooting accuracy, combined with his long seven-foot frame and unique shooting mechanics (such as having a release point above his head), made his jump shots difficult to contest. Before the start of the 2011 NBA Finals, LeBron James called Nowitzki&#x27;s one-legged fadeaway the second most unstoppable move ever, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s skyhook.
Additionally, Nowitzki could drive to the basket from the perimeter like few men his size were able to do. NBA.com lauded his versatility by stating: &quot;The 7–0 forward who at times mans the pivot can strike fear in an opponent when he corrals a rebound and leads the break or prepares to launch a three-point bomb.&quot; Charles Barkley said the best way to guard Nowitzki was to &quot;get a cigarette and a blindfold&quot;. Later on in his career, Nowitzki also developed an unorthodox post-up game, often backing down his opponents from the free-throw line or near the middle of the key, opening up the floor for multiple passing angles should a double team come his way. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Nowitzki as the 21st greatest player in NBA history.

Nowitzki was the sixth player in NBA history, and the first European, to hit the 30,000-point milestone. Apart from being the Mavericks&#x27; all-time leader in points, rebounds, field goals, field goal attempts, 3-pointers, 3-point attempts, blocks, free throws, and free-throw attempts, Nowitzki made the NBA All-Star games fourteen times and the All-NBA Teams twelve times. He was voted NBA MVP of the 2006–07 NBA season, becoming the first European player to receive the honor, as well as the MVP of the 2011 NBA Finals. Other achievements include winning the 2006 Three-Point Contest and the 2017 NBA Teammate of the Year award, being voted European Basketballer of the Year five times in a row by &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;. He was the leading scorer and MVP of the 2002 FIBA World Championship, and EuroBasket 2005 tournaments.

Nowitzki is the only player to record at least 30,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 3,000 assists, 1,200 steals, 1,250 blocks and 1,500 three-point field goals.

==Personal life==
Nowitzki&#x27;s older sister, Silke Nowitzki, described Nowitzki as a confident but low-key character, unspoiled by money and fame. He enjoys reading and playing the saxophone. Nowitzki passed his Abitur examination at Röntgen Gymnasium Grammar School of Würzburg. He founded the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation, a charity which aims at fighting poverty in Africa.

Nowitzki dated Sybille Gerer, a female basketball player from his local club DJK Würzburg. The relationship started in 1992 and lasted for 10 years before it ended in 2002; Nowitzki said, &quot;At the end, we found out we developed in separate ways... It did not work anymore, but we are still good friends.&quot; He added: &quot;I surely want to start a family and have kids, but I cannot imagine it happening before I become 30.&quot;

In 2010, Nowitzki met and began dating Jessica Olsson, sister of twin footballers Martin Olsson and Marcus Olsson. The couple got married on July 20, 2012, at Nowitzki&#x27;s home in Dallas. They have a daughter, born in July 2013 and two sons, born in March 2015 and November 2016. Though Nowitzki has considered acquiring U.S. citizenship, he remains a German national. In 2021 he received the green card.

Nowitzki acknowledged close ties to his mentor Holger Geschwindner, whom he called his best friend. He is also good friends with his ex-teammate Steve Nash. Nash said of playing with Nowitzki, &quot;We were both joining a new club, living in a new city, we were both single and outsiders: this creates a bond... He made life easier for me and I for him... Our friendship was something solid in a very volatile world.&quot; Nowitzki added, &quot;He would have also become a good friend if we had met at the supermarket.&quot;

Nowitzki is a keen association football fan and an avid supporter of Arsenal F.C.

==Books==
Nowitzki&#x27;s career has been chronicled in books. &quot;Dirk Nowitzki: German Wunderkind&quot;, written by German sports journalists Dino Reisner and Holger Sauer, was published in 2004 by CoPress Munich. The 160-page hardcover book follows Nowitzki&#x27;s beginnings in his native Würzburg, documents his entry into and ascent within the NBA, and ends at the beginning of the 2004–05 NBA season.

In November 2011, the Würzburg local newspaper &quot;Main-Post&quot; published a 216-page book written by its sports journalists Jürgen Höpfl and Fabian Frühwirth: &quot;Einfach Er – Dirk Nowitzki – Aus Würzburg an die Weltspitze&quot;, (&quot;Just Him – Dirk Nowitzki – From Würzburg to the Top of the World&quot;). Both Höpfl and Frühwirth accompanied Nowitzki throughout his career, collecting interviews and photos used in the book. It looks back on the 2011 NBA Finals but also has a strong focus on Nowitzki&#x27;s relation to his hometown Würzburg and his career progression which began there. The book features insights from former coaches, family members, and friends.

In 2019, Thomas Pletzinger published the 502-page biography &quot;The Great Nowitzki&quot;, which was regarded as one of the best sports biographies to have ever been published in German.

==In popular culture==
In 2014, the film documentary &quot;Nowitzki. The Perfect Shot&quot; was released, which retells Nowitzki&#x27;s career and life.

==Honors==
On October 30, 2019, by a unanimous resolution of the Dallas City Council, part of Olive Street was renamed Nowitzki Way, which runs past the American Airlines Center. In December 2019, Nowitzki received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany from Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in recognition of his social commitment.

On January 5, 2022, Nowitzki&#x27;s number 41 was retired by the Mavericks. The same night, Mark Cuban unveiled the design for a statue of Nowitzki that was planned to be installed outside the American Airlines Center in Dallas. The statue was unveiled on Christmas Day later that year.

A different was unveiled on October 12, 2023, in recognition of Nowitzki&#x27;s long-term advertising activities by the CEO of the ING Germany in the presence of Nowitzki in Frankfurt. The statue made by the sculptor Andreas Artur Hoferick of bronze, slightly over life size, shows Nowitzki sitting on a wooden bench on one side. The position on the bench is said to invite passersby to take space next to the athlete.

<text>Bute County, North Carolina is a former county in eastern North Carolina. In 1779, it was divided into Franklin County and Warren County and ceased to exist.

==History==
Bute County was established on June 10, 1764, from the eastern part of Granville County by the North Carolina General Assembly and named for John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1762 to 1763. It was formed in order to bring the residents of the eastern half of Granville County with improved access to local government, particularly those residing in St. John&#x27;s Parish. It was expanded in 1766 to include the northwest part of Northampton County.

The residents of Bute County were very much opposed to British rule. When governor William Tryon called for troops to counter the Regulator Movement in 1768, his orders were ignored by the Bute County militia. In the 1770s, it was claimed that &quot;There were no Tories in Bute&quot;. After the Provincial Congress of 1775 and 1776, an act was proposed to divide Bute County. After more than two years of discussion, Bute County was divided on January 20, 1779, generally along the Shocco Creek, with Warren County in the north and Franklin County to the south.

The Bute County courthouse was located along Buffalo Rice Path, on land owned by Jethro Sumner. This location is about six miles southeast of Warrenton, North Carolina. There was one other town in Bute County, a town without a post office called Littleton. Most of the records of Bute county are located in Warren County.

<doc id="396812" wikidata="Q745286" url="?curid=396812" title="Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet">
<text>Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy, 1st Baronet, GCB (5 April 1769 – 20 September 1839) was a British Royal Navy officer. He took part in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in February 1797, the Battle of the Nile in August 1798 and the Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. He served as flag captain to Admiral Lord Nelson, and commanded HMS &quot;Victory&quot; at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars. Nelson was shot as he paced the decks with Hardy, and as he lay dying, Nelson&#x27;s famous remark of &quot;Kiss me, Hardy&quot; was directed at him. Hardy went on to become First Naval Lord in November 1830 and in that capacity refused to become a Member of Parliament and encouraged the introduction of steam warships.

==Early life==
Born the second son of Joseph Hardy and Nanny Hardy (née Masterman) at Kingston Russell House in Long Bredy (or according to some sources in Winterborne St Martin), Hardy joined the navy with his entry aboard the brig on 30 November 1781 as a captain&#x27;s servant, but left her in April 1782 to attend Crewkerne Grammar School. During his time at school his name was carried on the books of the sixth-rate and the third-rate .

==Mediterranean and Nelson==
Hardy joined the fifth-rate on 5 February 1790 as a midshipman; he later transferred to the sixth-rate under Captain Anthony Hunt, and then followed Hunt to the sixth-rate in May 1793, going out to the Mediterranean in her. Hardy served off Marseilles and Toulon and was commissioned second lieutenant of the fifth-rate under Captain Charles Tyler on 10 November 1793.

Command of &quot;Meleager&quot; passed to Captain George Cockburn in June 1794; Cockburn took command of the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Minerve&quot; in August 1796 and Hardy went with him, subsequently becoming his first lieutenant. Horatio Nelson, then a commodore, moved his broad pennant to &quot;Minerve&quot; in December 1796. While en route to Gibraltar, in the action of 19 December 1796, &quot;Minerve&quot; and her consort, the fifth-rate , engaged two Spanish frigates and forced &quot;Santa Sabina&quot; to surrender. Lieutenants Hardy and Culverhouse were sent aboard &quot;Santa Sabina&quot; with a prize crew, and the three ships continued on towards Gibraltar. Before the night was out, Nelson ran into the Spanish fleet and only managed to get away when Hardy drew the Spanish away from &quot;Minerve&quot; and fought until being dismasted and captured. Hardy and Culverhouse were almost immediately exchanged for the captain of &quot;Santa Sabina&quot;, Don Jacobo Stuart, and were able to rejoin &quot;Minerve&quot; at Gibraltar on 9 February 1797.

Three days later &quot;Minerve&quot; left Gibraltar to join the main fleet off the south-east coast of Spain under Sir John Jervis. With two enemy ships pursuing him, Cockburn ordered more sail. During this operation, a topman fell overboard. The ship hove to and a boat with Hardy in it was lowered to search for the missing mariner. As the enemy ships were closing fast, Cockburn thought it prudent to withdraw, but Nelson overruled him crying &quot;By God, I&#x27;ll not lose Hardy, back that mizzen topsail!&quot; This confused the Spaniards who checked their own progress, allowing Hardy to return to his ship and make good his escape.

==Command and the Nile==
Hardy remained with &quot;Minerve&quot; until May 1797 when, following a successful cutting out expedition of which he was in charge, he was promoted to master and commander of the newly captured corvette . Under Hardy&#x27;s command, &quot;Mutine&quot; joined a squadron under Captain Thomas Troubridge which met up with Nelson off Toulon in June 1798, located Napoleon Bonaparte in Egypt and destroyed the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. Afterwards, Nelson&#x27;s flag captain, Edward Berry was sent home with dispatches and Hardy was promoted to captain of Nelson&#x27;s flagship, , in his place on 2 October 1798.

HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; carried King Ferdinand IV and the British ambassador Sir William Hamilton and his wife Emma from Naples to safety in Sicily in December 1798: Hardy did not altogether approve of Lady Hamilton who had once tried to intervene on behalf of a boat&#x27;s crew – Hardy had the crew flogged twice, once for the original offence and again for petitioning the lady. Nelson transferred his flag to the third-rate on 8 June 1799, taking Hardy with him. In June 1799, the main fleet, led by &quot;Foudroyant&quot;, landed marines at Naples to assist with the overthrow of the Parthenopean Republic so allowing Ferdinand&#x27;s kingdom to be re-established. Hardy handed over command of &quot;Foudroyant&quot; to Sir Edward Berry on 13 October 1799, transferred to the fifth-rate and returned to England.

==Baltic and Copenhagen==
After a year ashore, Hardy went to Plymouth Dock in December 1800 to take command of the first-rate , which had just been refitted. He transferred to the second-rate and became Nelson&#x27;s flag captain once more in February 1801. Nelson was appointed second in command of the Baltic fleet, which had been sent to force the Danes to withdraw from the League of Armed Neutrality. On the night of 1 April 1801, Hardy was sent in a boat to take soundings around the anchored Danish fleet. Hardy&#x27;s ship drew too much water and so took no part in the Battle of Copenhagen the following day, though his work proved to be of great value. The only two ships that went aground, the third-rates and , were taken in by local pilots and did not follow Hardy&#x27;s recommended route. Hardy stayed on as flag captain to the new fleet commander, Vice-Admiral Charles Pole, until August 1801 when he took command of the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Isis&quot;.

==Mediterranean and West Indies Campaign==
In July 1802, Hardy was appointed to the fifth-rate which after taking the new British ambassador to Lisbon, returned to Portsmouth. Nelson was in Portsmouth, as he was due to hoist his flag in the first-rate in May 1803, but on finding the ship not ready for him, transferred his flag to the &quot;Amphion&quot; and set sail for the Mediterranean. Nelson and Hardy finally transferred to &quot;Victory&quot; off Toulon on 31 July 1803. Nelson&#x27;s fleet continued to blockade Toulon until April 1805, when the French escaped and were pursued to the West Indies and back. After a brief stop at Spithead between 20 August and 14 September 1805, they set sail for Cádiz arriving on 29 September 1805. George Murray, Nelson&#x27;s captain of the fleet, was obliged to remain in England and Hardy unofficially replaced him in addition to serving as flag captain.

==Trafalgar==
As &quot;Victory&quot; approached the enemy line on the morning of 21 October 1805, Hardy urged Nelson to transfer to another ship to avoid the inevitable melee, but Nelson refused. &quot;Victory&quot;, leading the weather column, came under heavy fire in the opening stages of the Battle of Trafalgar. At one point, a splinter took the buckle from Hardy&#x27;s shoe, to which Nelson remarked, &quot;This is too warm work Hardy, to last for long&quot;. Hardy was with Nelson when he was shot and, towards the end of the battle, as Nelson lay below dying, the two had a number of conversations together. Hardy was able to tell Nelson that 14 or 15 enemy ships had struck their flags: Nelson replied that he had &quot;bargained for 20&quot;. In their last conversation, Nelson reminded Hardy to anchor the fleet. Nelson went on to say &quot;take care of my dear Lady Hamilton, Hardy, take care of poor Lady Hamilton&quot; and then when the moment came for the two men to part for the last time, Nelson then very close to death, asked Hardy to kiss him. Hardy kissed him on the cheek; &quot;Now I am satisfied,&quot; said Nelson, &quot;Thank God I have done my duty&quot;. Hardy stood up and then having spent a few moments looking down silently at his friend, knelt and kissed him again on the forehead. &quot;Who is that?&quot; asked Nelson, now barely able to see. &quot;It is Hardy&quot; Hardy replied. &quot;God bless you Hardy&quot; was Nelson&#x27;s last response. &quot;Victory&quot; was towed to Gibraltar, arriving on 28 October 1805, where she underwent major repairs, before setting set sail for England on 4 November 1805 and arriving at Portsmouth on 5 December 1805. There Nelson&#x27;s body was transferred to the Sheerness Commissioner, Sir George Grey, 1st Baronet&#x27;s yacht &quot;Chatham&quot; to proceed to Greenwich. Hardy carried one of the banners at Nelson&#x27;s funeral procession on 9 January 1806.

==Later commands==
Hardy was created a baronet on 29 January 1806 and was given command of the third-rate on the North American Station in May 1806. While in Nova Scotia, he married Anna Louisa Berkeley, the daughter of his commander-in-chief, Sir George Cranfield Berkeley. When Admiral Berkeley was sent to Lisbon, Hardy went with him as his flag captain in the second-rate . Hardy was made a commodore in the Portuguese Navy in 1811.

In August 1812, Hardy was given command of the third-rate and was sent back to North America at the outbreak of the War of 1812. On 11 July 1814, Hardy in his flagship, assisted by Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Pilkington, led four other warships and several transports carrying 2,000 men of the 102nd Regiment of Foot and a company of Royal Artillery against Fort Sullivan in Eastport, Maine. The American defending force of 70 regulars and 250 militiamen gave up without a fight. Hardy and Pilkington issued a proclamation making it clear Great Britain considered Eastport and the several nearby islands to be British territory. Townspeople were required to take an oath of allegiance to the crown or leave. Two-thirds of the inhabitants took the oath, while 500 departed. For the few weeks he remained at the place, Hardy became a favourite of the locals, gaining great respect and popularity. However, Hardy&#x27;s next venture, the 9–11 August bombardment of Stonington, Connecticut was a defeat; Royal Navy cannonading set 20 buildings on fire while killing a horse and a goose, while reports indicate the sizeable American defending force killed 21 and wounded 50 British attackers. Hardy was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1815.

Hardy was given command of the royal yacht HMS &quot;Princess Augusta&quot; in July 1816 and, then having been promoted to commodore, became Commander-in-Chief on the South America Station, hoisting his broad pennant in third-rate in August 1819, with a mission to prevent the Spanish from interfering in the newly emerging republics of Mexico, Colombia and Argentina.

==Flag rank==
Promoted to rear admiral on 27 May 1825, Hardy hoisted his flag aboard the third-rate and escorted 4,000 British troops to Lisbon, where they helped to quell a revolution by the eight-year-old queen&#x27;s uncle in December 1826. He was subsequently given command of an experimental squadron in the Channel, moving his flag from the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Sybille&quot; to the sixth-rate before going ashore for the last time on 21 October 1827.


Hardy became First Naval Lord in the Grey ministry in November 1830 and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 13 September 1831. As first Naval Lord he refused to become a Member of Parliament and encouraged the introduction of steam warships. He resigned in August 1834 to become Governor of Greenwich Hospital. Hardy was promoted to vice admiral on 10 January 1837.

He died at Greenwich on 20 September 1839. He is buried in the officers vault in Greenwich Hospital Cemetery, just west of National Maritime Museum. The grave lies in the enclosed railed area of the now mainly cleared graveyard, which now serves as a pocket park. The baronetcy became extinct on his death.

==Family==
On 17 November 1807 Hardy married Louisa Emily Anna Berkeley, daughter of Admiral Sir George Cranfield Berkeley; they had three daughters:

* Louisa Georgina Hardy (7 December 1808 – 1875).
* Emily Georgina Hardy (30 December 1809 – 8 April 1887); married in 1850 William Pollett Brown Chatteris (1810–1889), of Sandleford Priory, Berkshire.
* Mary Charlotte Hardy (20 March 1813 – 1896); married in 1833 Sir John Murray-Macgregor, 3rd Baronet.

Lady Hardy had &quot;a kind of love affair on paper&quot; with the poet Lord Byron, a distant relative of hers, in around 1822.

==Hardy Monument==
The Hardy Monument is a high monument erected on Dorset&#x27;s Black Down hill in 1844 by public subscription in memory of Hardy. Admiral Hardy had lived in nearby Portesham, and his family owned the Portesham estate which stretched from the middle of Portesham to Black Down. The monument&#x27;s site was chosen because the Hardy family wanted a monument which could be used as a landmark for shipping. The monument has been shown on navigational charts since 1846 and is visible from a distance of .
==Literary tribute==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration to Richard Evans&#x27; portrait, describes aspects of Hardy&#x27;s career. This was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836

==Honours==
His honours included:
* Knight Grand Cross of the Bath (GCB) – 13 September 1831
* Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) – 2 January 1815
* Baronet – 29 January 1806

<doc id="396828" wikidata="Q1701039" url="?curid=396828" title="John McLaughlin (host)">
<text>John Joseph McLaughlin (; March 29, 1927 – August 16, 2016) was an American television personality and political commentator. He created, produced, and hosted the political commentary series &quot;The McLaughlin Group.&quot; He also hosted and produced &quot;John McLaughlin&#x27;s One on One&quot;, which ran from 1984 to 2013.

==Education and early career==
John Joseph McLaughlin was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of Augustus Hugh McLaughlin and his wife Eva Philomena, née Turcotte. He grew up in a Catholic family who were second-generation Irish Americans and attended La Salle Academy (Rhode Island), Providence. At age 18, he entered Weston College in Weston, Massachusetts, which later became the theological seminary of Boston College, to become a Catholic priest.

He entered the Jesuit order in 1947, aged 20, was ordained as a priest in 1959, and went on to earn two master&#x27;s degrees (philosophy and English literature) from Boston College. After his ordination, McLaughlin spent some years as a high school teacher at Fairfield College Preparatory School, a Jesuit prep school in Connecticut. He took time off from teaching to earn a Ph.D. (philosophy) from Columbia University. He wrote his thesis on the Catholic poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. He then became a writer and later assistant editor for the Jesuit current affairs publication, &quot;America&quot;, in New York City. Disagreements with the editor of the magazine led to his departure in 1970 after which he moved back to Providence.

==Political career==

McLaughlin was originally a supporter of the Democratic Party and opposed the Vietnam War, but then became a war supporter and changed his party affiliation to Republican. In 1970, he sought permission from the Jesuit order to run for a seat in the United States Senate, representing Rhode Island. They had given permission to fellow Jesuit Father Robert Drinan who ran successfully for the United States House of Representatives in Massachusetts. When they refused, McLaughlin ran anyway but lost to the incumbent four-term Senator John O. Pastore. Through a friendship with Pat Buchanan, McLaughlin then became a speechwriter for U.S. President Richard Nixon. In 1974, after the resignation of President Nixon, he spent two months under President Gerald Ford&#x27;s administration. In 1975, he left the priesthood.

==Media career==
After leaving the White House, McLaughlin worked with his wife Ann in public relations and in 1980 became a weekend radio host on WRC-AM in Washington, D.C. Eventually he was fired from that job.

He then went on to write for &quot;National Review&quot; and to host &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;, which premiered in 1982. The television show brought together four political commentators, usually two conservatives and two liberals, with McLaughlin seated in the middle. McLaughlin was known for his loud and forceful style of presentation, usually stating his opinion in an apodictic manner and often cutting off other panelists by declaring their opinion &quot;Wrong!&quot; or putting a question to the panel, listening to other opinions, before finally giving his opinion as &quot;the correct answer&quot;. Discussions in the McLaughlin Group tended to run until the very last few seconds of airtime, when McLaughlin would rather abruptly end each episode by saying &quot;Bye-bye!&quot;. McLaughlin&#x27;s style and mannerisms were parodied by comedians and other commentators, most notably Dana Carvey of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. McLaughlin enjoyed &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s recurring &quot;McLaughlin Group&quot; sketches, even making a 1991 cameo appearance as the Grim Reaper in one of them.

McLaughlin also hosted the interview show &quot;John McLaughlin&#x27;s One on One&quot;, first telecast in 1984, and ended in 2013. Also from 1989 through 1994, he produced and hosted &quot;McLaughlin&quot;, a one-hour nightly talk show on CNBC. For a short while in 1999, he hosted an MSNBC show, &quot;McLaughlin Special Report&quot;. The show was announced on January 22, and its cancellation was announced on February 25. A revival of &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; ran briefly in 2018, and retained McLaughlin&#x27;s name in the show&#x27;s title despite his death.

==Personal life and death==
On August 23, 1975, McLaughlin married Ann Dore (née Lauenstein), his former campaign manager. She served as Secretary of Labor under President Ronald Reagan from 1987 until 1989. During this period, McLaughlin was sued for sexual harassment and discrimination by a former employee. He settled the suit in December 1989.

McLaughlin and Dore divorced in 1992. McLaughlin married his second wife Cristina Clara Vidal on June 22, 1997. The marriage ended in divorce in 2010.

During the December 26, 2014, year-end awards episode, McLaughlin ended the show saying: &quot;Person of the year: Pope Francis, especially now that he&#x27;s told that animals can go to heaven. And Oliver is up there waiting for me.&quot; Oliver Productions, Inc., is named after McLaughlin&#x27;s pet dog  — a Basset Hound — and is seen in an animation as part of the brand logo shown at the close of each show. Oliver shared their Watergate apartment during McLaughlin&#x27;s tenure as speechwriter for President Nixon.

After missing his first broadcast in 34 years, McLaughlin died on August 16, 2016, at his home in Washington, D.C. of prostate cancer at the age of 89. McLaughlin&#x27;s last message to fans was August 13, when he explained he had missed recent tapings due to his poor health.

==In popular culture==
The McLaughlin Group was parodied a number of times on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the early 1990s, where McLaughlin was played by Dana Carvey. McLaughlin also appeared in several films, including &quot;Dave&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and &quot;War, Inc.&quot;, generally portraying himself discussing a political character in the movie. In the 2009 movie &quot;Watchmen&quot;, he is portrayed by Gary Houston in an early scene interviewing Pat Buchanan (played by James M. Connor) and Eleanor Clift (played by Mary Ann Burger) about the possibility of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. McLaughlin also hosted a special celebration for the 200th episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;.

<doc id="396829" wikidata="Q6317275" url="?curid=396829" title="Justifiable homicide">
<text>The concept of justifiable homicide in criminal law is a defense to culpable homicide (criminal or negligent homicide). Generally, there is a burden to produce exculpatory evidence in the legal defense of justification. 

In most countries, a homicide is justified when there is sufficient evidence to disprove the alleged criminal act or wrongdoing (under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard for criminal charges, and preponderance of evidence standard for claims of wrongdoing, i.e. civil liability). The key to this legal defense is that it was reasonable for the subject to believe that there was an imminent and otherwise unavoidable danger of death or grave bodily harm to the innocent by the deceased, when they committed the homicide.

==Definition==
Justifiable homicide applies to the blameless killing of a person, such as in self-defense.

The term &quot;legal intervention&quot; is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement.
For example, in 2020, legal intervention deaths i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force acting in the line of duty, excluding legal executions, amounted to 1.3% of all 71,000 violence-related deaths in the United States.

== Common excusing conditions ==

Potentially excusing conditions common to multiple jurisdictions include the following.
# Capital punishment in places that it is legal.
# Where a state is engaged in a war with a legitimate &quot;casus belli&quot;, a combatant may lawfully kill an enemy combatant so long as that combatant is not &quot;hors de combat&quot;. This principle is embedded in public international law and has been respected by most states around the world.
# In most countries, it is lawful for a citizen to repel violence with violence to protect someone&#x27;s life or destruction of property.
#* The scope of self-defense varies; some jurisdictions have a duty to retreat rule that disallows this defense if it was safe to flee from potential violence. In some jurisdictions, the castle doctrine allows the use of deadly force in self-defense against an intruder in one&#x27;s home. Other jurisdictions have stand-your-ground laws that allow use of deadly force in self-defense in a vehicle or in public, without a duty to retreat.
# Where the person&#x27;s death as inflicted by the effecting of lawful arrest or prevention of lawfully detained person&#x27;s escape, quelling riot or insurrection when the use of force is &quot;no more than absolutely necessary&quot;.
# The doctrine of necessity allows, for example, a surgeon to separate conjoined twins, killing the weaker twin to allow the stronger twin to survive. This is not recognized, for example, in England and Wales.
# Several countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, and the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington allow both active and passive euthanasia by law, if justified.
# The &quot;heat of the moment&quot; defense for crimes of passion: death results from a situation where the defendant is deemed to have lost control. This may be considered a part of the defense of provocation against charges of murder. Based on the idea that all individuals may suddenly and unexpectedly lose control when words are spoken or events occur, jurisdictions differ on whether this should be allowed to excuse liability or merely mitigate to a lesser offense such as manslaughter, and under which circumstances this defense can be used. In many common law jurisdictions, provocation is a partial defense that converts what would have been murder into manslaughter.
#A few jurisdictions do not prosecute (Iran, Iraq) or have a lesser penalty (Kuwait, Egypt) for honor killings.

== European Convention on Human Rights ==

Article 2 Paragraph 2 of the European Convention On Human Rights provides that death resulted from defending oneself or others, arresting a suspect or fugitive, or suppressing riots or insurrections, will not contravene the Article when the use of force involved is &quot;no more than absolutely necessary&quot;:
::: 2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:
::: (a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;
::: (b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;
::: (c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.

==Criminal Procedure Act in South Africa ==

In South Africa, §49 Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 provided the following before its amendment in 1998: 
:::(2) Where the person concerned is to be arrested for an offense referred to in Schedule 1 or is to be arrested on the ground of having committed such an offense, and the person authorized under this Act to arrest or to assist in arresting him cannot arrest him or prevent him from fleeing by other means than killing him, the killing shall be deemed to be justifiable homicide.
::This has now been amended by §7 Judicial Matters Second Amendment Act 122 of 1998:
:::(2) If any arrestor attempts to arrest a suspect and the suspect resists the attempt, or flees, or resists the attempt and flees, when it is clear that an attempt to arrest him or her is being made, and the suspect cannot be arrested without the use of force, the arrestor may, in order to effect the arrest, use such force as may be reasonably necessary and proportional in the circumstances to overcome resistance or to prevent the suspect from fleeing: Provided that the arrester is justified in terms of this section in using deadly force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to a suspect, only if he believes on reasonable grounds-
:::(a) that the force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting the arrestor, any person lawfully assisting the arrestor or any other person from imminent or future death or grievous bodily harm;
:::(b) that there is a substantial risk that the suspect will cause imminent or future death or grievous bodily harm if the arrest is delayed; or
:::(c) that the offence for which the arrest is sought is in progress and is of a forcible and serious nature and involves the use of life threatening violence or a strong likelihood that it will cause grievous bodily harm.

==In the United States ==

A non-criminal homicide ruling, usually committed in self-defense or in defense of another, exists under United States law. A homicide may be considered justified if it is done to prevent a very serious crime, such as rape, armed robbery, manslaughter or murder. The victim must reasonably believe, under the totality of the circumstances, that the assailant intended to commit a criminal act that would likely result in the death or life-threatening injury of an innocent person. A homicide performed out of vengeance, or retribution for action in the past, or in pursuit of a &quot;fleeing felon&quot; (except under specific circumstances) would not be considered justifiable.

In many states, given a case of self-defense, the defendant is expected to obey a duty to retreat if it is possible to do so. In the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Washington, Wyoming and other Castle Doctrine states, there is no duty to retreat in certain situations (depending on the state, this may apply to one&#x27;s home, business, or vehicle, or to any public place where a person is lawfully present). Preemptive self-defense, in which one kills another on suspicion that the victim might eventually become dangerous, is not justifiable.

In the U.S. Supreme Court ruling of &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, the majority held that the Constitution protected the right to the possession of firearms for the purpose of self-defense &quot;and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home&quot;.

Two other forms of justifiable homicide are unique to the prison system: the death penalty and preventing prisoners from escaping. To quote the California Penal Code (state law) that covers justifiable homicide:

Although the above text is from California law, many other jurisdictions, like Florida, have similar laws to prevent escapes from custody. Examples include self defense, prevention of criminal act, trespassers, and defense of another person.

== Notable cases==

* Killing of Ma&#x27;Khia Bryant. Her shooting, which prevented her from stabbing another girl, was later deemed a justifiable homicide with prosecutors noting, &quot;Under Ohio law the use of deadly force by a police officer is justified when there exists an immediate or imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or another.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_3/12/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sam Cooke. After an inquest and investigation, the courts ruled Cooke&#x27;s death to be a justifiable homicide.
* John Dillinger. When BOI agents moved to arrest Dillinger as he exited the theater, he tried to flee. He was shot in the back; the deadly shot was ruled justifiable homicide.
* Fred Hampton. In January 1970, the Cook County Coroner held an inquest; the jury concluded that Hampton&#x27;s and Clark&#x27;s deaths were justifiable homicides.
* George Jackson (activist). Miller had not been charged with any crime, as a grand jury ruled his actions during the prison fight justifiable homicide.
* Don King. In 1954, King shot a man after spotting him trying to rob one of his gambling houses; this incident was ruled a justifiable homicide.
* Killing of Sara-Nicole Morales. In 2021 Morales confronted several motorists who had followed her to her Florida home following a road rage incident. After she brandished a pistol at them from her front lawn, a motorcyclist she had deliberately struck with her vehicle during the road-rage incident drew his own legally carried weapon and shot her several times; she died shortly after arrival at a local hospital. Police declined to file charges several months later.
* Eadweard Muybridge. In 1874, Muybridge shot and killed Major Harry Larkyns, his wife&#x27;s lover, but was acquitted in a controversial jury trial, on the grounds of justifiable homicide.
* Johnny Stompanato homicide. After four hours of testimony and approximately 25 minutes of deliberation, the jury deemed Stompanato&#x27;s killing a justifiable homicide.

<text>Alfred Howe Terry (November 10, 1827 – December 16, 1890) was a Union general in the American Civil War and the military commander of the Dakota Territory from 1866 to 1869, and again from 1872 to 1886. In 1865, Terry led Union troops to victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in North Carolina.

==Early life and career==
Although born in Hartford, Connecticut, Alfred Terry&#x27;s family quickly moved to New Haven, where he spent most of his childhood. Terry graduated from the Hopkins School in New Haven in 1838. After attending Yale Law School in 1848, Terry became a lawyer and was appointed clerk of the Superior Court of New Haven County.

==Civil War==

===South Carolina===
When the Civil War started, Terry raised the 2nd Connecticut Infantry Regiment, and was appointed colonel. The regiment fought at First Bull Run, after which Terry and his regiment were transferred to South Carolina. On September 13, 1861, at New Haven, Connecticut, Col. Terry organized an elite and special regiment, 7th Regiment Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, a three-year regiment, naming Joseph Roswell Hawley, who assisted in raising the regiment, as lieutenant colonel. He was appointed brigadier general of volunteers in April 1862 and placed in command of the Morris Island Division of the X Corps. Terry was heavily involved in the siege operations against Charleston during 1863 and Morris Island, South Carolina. Troops under Terry&#x27;s direct command were engaged at a skirmish at Grimball&#x27;s Landing and later succeeded in capturing Fort Wagner in September 1863, but the following year the entire X Corps was sent north to Benjamin Butler&#x27;s Army of the James in Virginia.

===Virginia===
Terry&#x27;s Morris Island Division was redesignated the 1st Division, X Corps, and fought at the Battle of Proctor&#x27;s Creek and in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign around Richmond. Once the Siege of Petersburg began, Terry continued to fight in the battles north of the James River, notably at the Battle of New Market Heights. Upon the death of X Corps commander David B. Birney in October, Terry briefly assumed command of the corps before it was dissolved. His leadership was never in question, but he had not achieved the same battlefield glory that many of his counterparts had won by this time in the war.

===Fort Fisher and North Carolina===
Terry&#x27;s greatest achievement of the war came when he was placed in command of the Fort Fisher Expeditionary Corps. Benjamin Butler had previously failed in an expedition against Fort Fisher at the end of 1864. Terry had gained the confidence of General Ulysses S. Grant and was now in command of the ground forces in a second expedition against the fort. Unlike Butler, Terry worked well with the Navy under the command of David D. Porter. On January 13, 1865, Terry sent a division of United States Colored Troops to hold off Confederate forces under Braxton Bragg to the north of Fort Fisher. He sent his other division under Adelbert Ames against the northern part of the fort. After hand-to-hand fighting, the Union troops took control of the fort. For his part in the Battle of Fort Fisher, Terry was promoted to major general of volunteers and brigadier general in the regular army. Reinforcements arrived in February and John M. Schofield arrived to take overall command of the campaign against Wilmington, North Carolina. After the fall of Wilmington, the Fort Fisher Expeditionary Corps was renamed the X Corps, with Terry remaining in command, and participated in the final stages of the Carolinas Campaign. He is generally considered one of the most capable generals with no previous military training to emerge from the war.

==Postbellum activities==

After the war, Terry remained in the military. He helped to negotiate the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), which ended Red Cloud&#x27;s campaign against American troops in the region. Terry became a strong opponent of the Ku Klux Klan after being assigned as the last military governor of the Third Military District, based in Atlanta, where he served beginning on December 22, 1869.

Terry was the commander of the U.S. Army column marching westward into the Montana Territory during what is now popularly known as the Centennial Campaign of 1876–77. Two other columns marched toward the same objective area (George Crook&#x27;s from the south and John Gibbon&#x27;s from the west). A column of troops under his command arrived shortly after the Battle of Little Bighorn and discovered the bodies of Custer&#x27;s men. His aide-de-camp, Robert Patterson Hughes, who was also his brother-in-law, investigated Custer&#x27;s activities before and during the battle and authored a critical report. In October 1877, he went to Canada to negotiate with Sitting Bull. He was still in command in Montana during the Nez Perce War and sent reinforcements to intercept Chief Joseph.

In 1878, Terry joined Maj. Gen. John Schofield on a presidential board asked to reexamine the conviction by court-martial of Fitz John Porter. The board found that Porter had been unfairly convicted of cowardice and disobedience.

In 1881, as the Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s transcontinental rail line was building across Montana, the new town of Terry, Montana was named in his honor.

In 1886, Terry was promoted to major general and was given command of the Military Division of the Missouri, headquartered in Chicago. He retired from the Army on 5 April 1888. He died two years later in New Haven, Connecticut, where he is buried in Grove Street Cemetery.

General Terry was a First Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society for officers of the Union Armed Forces and their descendants.

In 1897, construction commenced on Fort Terry, part of the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound.

==Media portrayals==

In 1967, Terry was portrayed by Robert F. Simon (1908–1992) on the ABC television series &quot;Custer&quot;.

Terry is interpreted by Philippe Noiret in the 1974 Franco-Italian satirical Marco Ferreri movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch the White Woman!&quot;, a farcical, counter-cultural, highly politicized and surreal re-enactment of the run up to the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn.

In 1991, Terry was portrayed by Terry O&#x27;Quinn in the television film &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot;.

<doc id="396839" wikidata="Q594906" url="?curid=396839" title="Stephen Mallory">
<text>Stephen Russell Mallory (1812 – November 9, 1873) was a Democratic senator from Florida from 1851 to the secession of his home state and the outbreak of the American Civil War. For much of that period, he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. It was a time of rapid naval reform, and he insisted that the ships of the U.S. Navy should be as capable as those of Britain and France, the foremost navies in the world at that time. He also wrote a bill and guided it through Congress to provide for compulsory retirement of officers who did not meet the standards of the profession.

Although he was not a leader in the secession movement, Mallory followed his state out of the Union. When the Confederate States of America was formed, he was named Secretary of the Navy in the administration of President Jefferson Davis. He held the position throughout the existence of the Confederacy. Because of indifference to naval matters by most others in the Confederacy, Mallory was able to shape the Confederate Navy according to the principles he had learned while serving in the U.S. Senate. Some of his ideas, such as the incorporation of armor into warship construction, were quite successful and became standard in navies around the world. On the other hand, the navy was often handicapped by administrative ineptitude in the Navy Department. During the war, he was weakened politically by a Congressional investigation into the Navy Department for its failure in defense of New Orleans. After months of taking testimony, the investigating committee concluded that it had no evidence of wrongdoing on his part.

Mallory resigned after the Confederate government had fled from Richmond at the end of the war, and he and several of his colleagues in the cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate although he was not incapacitated until the very end.

He was the father of Stephen Russell Mallory, a U.S. Representative and Senator from Florida.

==Early life==
Mallory was born in Trinidad, British West Indies, in 1812. His parents were Charles and Ellen Mallory. His father was a construction engineer originally from Redding, Connecticut. He met and married the Irish-born Ellen Russell in Trinidad, and there the couple had two sons.

The family moved to the United States and settled in Key West, Florida, in 1820. Young Stephen was sent to school near Mobile, Alabama, but his education was interrupted by his father&#x27;s death. His elder brother John also died about this time. To support herself and her surviving son, Ellen opened a boarding house for seamen. Then she sent her son away for further schooling at a Moravian academy in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Although he was for all of his life a practicing Catholic, he had only praise for the education he received at the academy. After about three years, his mother could no longer afford to pay his tuition, so in 1829 his schooling ended and he returned home.

==Adulthood in Florida==
Young Mallory prepared for a profession by reading law in the office of Judge William Marvin. Because of its geographical position, Key West was often sought as a port of refuge for ships caught in storms and was for the same reason near frequent shipwrecks. Marvin was recognized as an authority on maritime law, particularly applied to laws of wreck and salvage, and Mallory argued many admiralty cases before him. He was reputed to be one of the best young trial lawyers in the state.

His career prospering, in 1838 Mallory courted and wed Angela Moreno, a member of a wealthy Spanish-speaking family living in Pensacola. Their marriage produced nine children, five of whom died young; surviving into adulthood were daughters Margaret (&quot;Maggie&quot;) and Ruby, and sons Stephen R. Jr. (&quot;Buddy&quot;), and Attila (&quot;Attie&quot;). Buddy followed his father into politics, and he would eventually also serve as U.S. Senator from Florida. Angela Moreno was the cousin of Felix Senac, future Confederate Paymaster and agent in Europe, born like her in 1815 in Pensacola.

Mallory held a few minor public offices, beginning in 1832 with his selection as town marshal. One of his first paid positions was as Inspector of Customs, for which he earned three dollars per day. Later, President Polk appointed him Collector of Customs. Before his marriage, he joined the Army and took part in the Seminole War, 1835–1837. He also was elected judge for Monroe County for the years 1837–1845.

In 1850, the sectional differences that eventually culminated in the Civil War led to a convention to be held in Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of defining a common course of action for all Southern (slave-holding) states. Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention. Personal considerations kept him from attending, but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.

==In the Senate, 1851–1861==
The term in office of senator from Florida David Levy Yulee expired in 1850. He sought reappointment, but he had aligned himself too strongly with the Fire-eaters, and also had antagonized some commercial interests in the state. The moderates who favored working within the Union still dominated Florida politics, and they successfully sought to put Mallory in place of the radical Yulee. The selection process in the Florida state legislature was somewhat irregular, and Yulee protested, carrying his protest all the way to the Senate itself. That body determined that the Florida legislature had acted within its authority in certifying Mallory, and so he was seated.

===Senator from Florida===
Much of what he did in the Senate can be described as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.

===Committee on Naval Affairs===
Mallory was placed on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His assignment became significant when President Millard Fillmore, in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem of what to do with ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.

Mallory&#x27;s first major speech in Congress was in favor of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His position was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore&#x27;s proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement in the history of the U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory&#x27;s views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War when both men sided with the South.

Mallory&#x27;s tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs came during a time of great innovation in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he made sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, were in the process of converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the Navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.

Another innovation that was being considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned while he was in the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.

===Secession crisis===
Representing as he did a state in the Deep South, Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance on the issues that were tearing the nation apart. The occasion arose when the Senate considered the admission of Kansas to the Union. Its Lecompton Constitution would allow slavery in Kansas, and citizens who were against extending the practice into new territories seized upon the widespread irregularities in the adoption procedure to oppose it. Senator Preston King of New York mounted a two-hour attack on the constitution and Southern policy in general, following which Mallory replied in what his biographers describe as &quot;probably his most effective speech in the Senate.&quot; One segment of his talk presented the rationale of the slave-holders in their unwillingness to accept majority rule. Addressing the question whether the constitution had been ratified by &quot;the people,&quot; he said: &quot;States have conferred, and may at any time confer, their whole political power on a minority. They may make disqualifications dependent upon the tenure of freehold estate, upon the payment of tax, upon militia duty, or upon the color of skin; but whoever the State chooses to confer her political authority upon, are the people.&quot; He foresaw the decline in relative power of the slave-holding states, although at this time he did not believe it would necessarily lead to secession. He concluded his remarks by a pledge to follow the South whatever happened: &quot;It is not for me to indicate the path she [the South] may, in her wisdom, pursue; but, sir, ... my whole heart is with her, and she will find me treading it with undivided affections.&quot;

Despite his willing adherence to the Southern position on the issues that were dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement. He advocated reconciliation almost up to the moment that Florida passed its ordinance of secession. That occurred on January 10, 1861, making Florida the third state (behind South Carolina and Mississippi) to leave the Union. On January 21, Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate.

In the days before Abraham Lincoln took office, parties in the seceding states disagreed over the proper course of action concerning the forts within their domains. In Florida, three forts remained in the possession of the United States Army: Fort Zachary Taylor at Key West, Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, and Fort Pickens near Pensacola. Some of the most strident secessionists proposed that they be taken over immediately, by force if needed, beginning with Fort Pickens. Cooler heads hoped to avoid bloodshed and gain possession by negotiation; they made much of the conciliatory words of William H. Seward, already selected to be Secretary of State in the incoming administration. Mallory and Florida&#x27;s other senator, David L. Yulee, and the two senators from Alabama sent telegrams to their respective governors urging caution. Other Southern senators lent their support, and President-elect Jefferson Davis seemed to agree. In the end, the moderates won out, and no attack was made on Fort Pickens. Although Mallory was hardly alone, his political opponents later used his perceived pro-Union stance as an excuse to attack him.

==Confederate Secretary of the Navy: nomination and confirmation==

The governmental structure of the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much like that of the parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow to the principle of states&#x27; rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory&#x27;s case.

Mallory&#x27;s nomination as Secretary of the Navy was submitted to the Provisional Congress as soon as the act establishing a navy was passed. Despite his evident qualifications, it drew significant opposition; his detractors cited the Fort Pickens incident as evidence that he was not strongly pro-secession. Ultimately, however, he was confirmed.

===Naval organization and operations===
As few other persons in the Confederate government were interested in naval matters, Mallory had almost free rein to shape the department, as well as the navy it controlled, according to his own views. The result was very much the product of his prior experience. The Department of the Navy was organized into separate offices, equivalent to the bureau system of the United States Navy; whereas the U.S. Navy had five bureaus, the Confederate Navy had only four: Orders and Detail (dealing with personnel), Provisions and Clothing, Medicine and Surgery, and Ordnance and Hydrography. Although there was no Office of Construction and Repair, its function was met by John L. Porter. Porter served as Chief Naval Constructor, without title from the start until the position was officially established in 1863, and thereafter with title until the end of the war. A few other functions lay outside the bureau system: a small Marine Corps, a few men who were sent to Europe to acquire vessels there and who reported directly to Mallory, and a Torpedo Bureau.

At the start, the Confederate Navy faced one of the problems that Mallory had encountered when he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Naval Affairs: an overabundance of high-ranking officers who were too old to go to sea. This came about because the Confederacy had created its navy by promising that men resigning from the U.S. Navy would enter the CS Navy at their old rank. Hoping to avoid the stagnation that was the result of the former promotion process, Mallory proposed that promotion should depend solely on &quot;gallant or meritorious conduct during the war.&quot; His proposal was quickly made into law by the Confederate Congress. Still not completely satisfied, in 1863 Mallory initiated the creation of a Provisional Navy, which in effect established two officer corps. The officers whom Mallory or his advisers deemed incapable of combat were retained in the Regular Navy, while young and presumably more aggressive officers would transfer to the Provisional Navy. Officers for fighting ships would be drawn from the Provisional Navy, and they could be promoted without regard for seniority if they served with distinction.

Mallory also was able to shape naval policy and doctrine. After viewing the disparity between the shipbuilding and other manufacturing facilities of the Confederacy and those of the Union, he set forth a fourfold plan for the navy:
:1. Send out commerce raiders to destroy the enemy&#x27;s mercantile marine.
:2. Build ironclad vessels in Southern shipyards for defensive purposes.
:3. Obtain by purchase or construction abroad armored ships capable of fighting on the open seas.
:4. Employ new weapons and techniques of warfare.

===Attacks on Union commerce===
From the start, one of the main efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the blockade of its ports by the Union Navy. Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, to divert his own small fleet to defend against the raiders. In the early days of the war, the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private shipowners in the service by offering letters of marque and reprisal. Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department, but Mallory was aware of them and saw them as part of his plan. For several reasons, the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for. Although they ventured out throughout the war, they had only fleeting success, and that had ceased by the end of the first year.

He was more directly involved in the activities of the commissioned raiders, ships of the Confederate States Navy that were sent out to destroy rather than capture enemy commerce. He first proposed their use as early as April 18, 1861. The first raider, , avoided the Union blockade at New Orleans on June 30, 1861. From then until after the war was over, the small group of raiders plundered Union shipping, inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day. They failed of their primary purpose, however, because Welles maintained the Union blockade, and international trade continued as before, carried in ships flying foreign flags.

===Naval reform: ironclads===
No other aspect of Mallory&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of the Navy is better known than his advocacy of armored vessels. He argued that the Confederacy could never produce enough ships to compete with the industrial Union on a ship-by-ship basis. As he saw it, the South should build a few ships that were individually so far superior to their opponents as to dominate. In his words, &quot;The perfection of a warship would doubtless be a combination of the greatest known ocean speed with the greatest known floating battery and power of resistance.&quot; He hoped that armored warships would prove to be the &quot;ultimate weapon.&quot; He did not anticipate that his opponents would also produce armored vessels, which rapidly became important parts of both navies. Furthermore, other navies, notably Great Britain and France, stepped up the conversions of their own fleets from wood to iron. Certainly, the change was under way even before the Civil War broke out; his legacy consists in forcing the change to be made sooner than would otherwise have been done.

The first ironclad to be created at Mallory&#x27;s urging was . The burned and scuttled had been raised at Gosport (Norfolk) Navy Yard, and an armored casemate built on her hull. For armament, she carried 12 guns. She was also fitted with an iron ram. On March 8, 1862, she attacked the Union fleet enforcing the blockade at Hampton Roads, on the James River near Norfolk. She sank two major Union warships ( and ), and menaced a third (), which had grounded in the attempt to get into action. The damages she suffered were negligible. In that first day of the battle, she had demonstrated the basic validity of Mallory&#x27;s belief that armored warships could destroy the best wooden ships and were almost impervious to damage in return. As is well known, when &quot;Virginia&quot; returned to battle the next day intending to finish off &quot;Minnesota&quot;, she encountered the Union&#x27;s . The two armored vessels fought inconclusively, demonstrating the flaw in Mallory&#x27;s argument: an ultimate weapon is truly decisive only if one side does not have it.

After &quot;Virginia&quot;, most other Confederate ironclads had at best-limited success, and many were complete failures. Particularly embarrassing were four that were contracted to be built for service on the Mississippi River. Of the four, only one, , entered into combat in the way that was intended, with full crew and under steam. Of the others, was destroyed on the stocks; was hastily launched and then burned to avoid capture; and was used merely as an ineffectual floating battery at the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, when the fate of New Orleans was decided, and she was then blown up rather than be surrendered. No parties in the Confederacy acquitted themselves well in the three losses, but Mallory must bear a large part of the blame. Poor administration is among the foremost reasons for the delays that hindered completion of the vessels. By failing to prioritize their construction, he allowed &quot;Louisiana&quot; and &quot;Mississippi&quot; to compete for scarce resources. Because he did not delegate responsibility, he was swamped with details of the construction of &quot;Virginia&quot; while letting problems concerning the other ships go unresolved. And because he accepted the role implicitly assigned to his service as secondary to the Army, the Navy had to work with only the materials and funds that were left over after the Army had satisfied its needs.

===Mission to Europe===
The backward condition of shipyards in the seceding states convinced Mallory that he would have to look abroad to obtain the vessels that he thought would be able to challenge the U.S. Navy. He selected two men as his primary representatives: James D. Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy. North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved to be one of the most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe. He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes of his government while working within or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation.

Four of the Confederate Navy raiders were purchased in Britain: , , , and above all, . Probably Mallory would have liked to have more, but the record shows that the few that were commissioned were more than adequate.

Efforts to purchase or have built ironclad warships were unsuccessful despite Bulloch&#x27;s best efforts. Buying them was never seriously considered, as the Royal Navy would not care to give any of its best ships to a foreign power, no matter how favorably disposed. Contracts were made with private shipyards in both Britain and France to build rams to Confederate naval specifications, but their ultimate purpose could not be disguised. They therefore directly violated the neutrality laws, and American (that is, Union) officials immediately informed the governments of their existence. For a while, Her Majesty&#x27;s Government chose to turn a blind eye on developments, but the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg caused them to reconsider. On September 5, 1863, Ambassador Charles Francis Adams sent a message to Foreign Minister Lord John Russell informing him that the first of the ironclads was about to leave, and that &quot;it would be superfluous in me to point out to your Lordship that this means war.&quot; The ship was not permitted to leave and was later seized for the Royal Navy. As the French government had implicitly agreed to follow Britain&#x27;s lead concerning North America, all the contracts were voided.

===New weapons===
The Civil War provided a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was in position to provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, as opposed to the smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed by the head of his Office of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted to the end of the war.

The torpedo office, officially named the Submarine Battery Service, developed underwater explosive devices, known as &quot;torpedoes&quot; at that time but as &quot;mines&quot; today. The office was initially led by Mallory&#x27;s enemy Matthew Fontaine Maury, and later by Lieutenant Hunter Davidson. The first ship to be lost to mines was , on December 12, 1862. Subsequently, more vessels of all types were lost in combat to mines and torpedoes than from all other causes combined.

In Charleston Harbor, Army Captain Francis D. Lee, supported by General P. G. T. Beauregard, developed a small boat that would carry a spar torpedo. His craft, known as , successfully exploded a torpedo against the side of , severely damaging her. Later, the more famous used one of Lee&#x27;s spar torpedoes to sink , the first ship to be sunk by a submarine. The Navy Department had not provided active support for Lee&#x27;s experiments, but their successful result led to the use of spar torpedoes on ships throughout the fleet. (Less favorably for the Rebel cause, spar torpedoes were also immediately adopted by the Union Navy, and one was used in October 1864 to sink the ironclad .)

==Investigation of the Navy Department==
The loss of New Orleans came as a tremendous shock to the Confederacy, and a spate of recriminations followed. Members of Congress, noting the failure of the ironclads, blamed the navy in particular, and suggested that there was no need for a separate Navy Department. Hoping to forestall such a proposal, Mallory was able to persuade the Congress instead to investigate the conduct of the department. Each house put five of its members on the investigating committee. The chairman, Senator Clement C. Clay, was known as one of Mallory&#x27;s friends, as was Representative Ethelbert Barksdale. They were at least partially balanced by Representative Henry S. Foote, a persistent critic of secession and everything that the entire Davis administration had done. Also weighing in against Mallory was Senator Charles M. Conrad, chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, who was not a member of the investigating committee but who did appear as a prosecution witness. The committee continued to meet for more than six months, and ended with no finding of neglect or malfeasance.

The investigation may have weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties, but it was not enough to drive him from office. Perhaps because there was no one to replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee&#x27;s army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.

==After the war==

===Capture and imprisonment===
A large part of the population of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.

For several months, the demand of the public for vengeance increased, so that Mallory feared that he would face the death penalty if convicted. However, no bill of particulars to specify precisely which of his acts constituted treason was ever presented, and it became increasingly clear that no one in the Confederate government was guilty of assassinating the former president. The period for extracting vengeance passed with no one put on trial, and hope was revived. From his prison cell, Mallory began to write letters in a personal campaign to gain release. He petitioned President Andrew Johnson directly, and enlisted the support of some of his former colleagues in the Senate. His wife Angela visited Washington and importuned President Johnson and other persons who had influence. Johnson was already quite lenient in granting pardons, and the popular clamor for harsh punishment began to recede by the end of the year. On March 10, 1866, Johnson granted Mallory a &quot;partial parole.&quot; Although he was no longer in jail, he was required to stay with his daughter in Bridgeport, Connecticut until he could take the oath of allegiance.

===Release and return to Florida===
In June 1866, Mallory visited Washington, where he called on many of his old friends and political adversaries, including President Johnson and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who received him cordially. He got permission to return to Florida; his return was somewhat delayed by problems with his health, but on July 19 he arrived at his home in Pensacola.

By the terms of his parole, Mallory was not permitted to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice. Nominally excluded from politics, he managed to make his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers. At first he urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction, but he soon came out in opposition, particularly against black suffrage.

He had long suffered occasional attacks of gout, and these continued to plague him in the postwar years. In the winter of 1871–1872 he began to complain of his heart, and his health began to deteriorate. Still, he remained active, and the end came rather quickly. He is said to have been &quot;listless&quot; on November 8, 1873, and that night he began to fail. On the morning of November 9 he died. He was buried in St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery, Pensacola, Florida.

<text>Loras College is a private Catholic college in Dubuque, Iowa, United States. It has an enrollment of approximately 1,600 students and is the oldest post-secondary institution in the state of Iowa. The school offers both undergraduate and graduate degree programs. It is one of four four-year post-secondary institutions in the City of Dubuque, one of four Catholic colleges in the Archdiocese of Dubuque, and one of six Catholic colleges in the state of Iowa. The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Loras College Historic District in 2020.

==History==
Loras College, a liberal arts college, was founded in 1839 by Mathias Loras, first bishop of Dubuque, who established Saint Raphael&#x27;s Seminary to educate young men for the priesthood with the expressed intention of also providing an opportunity for higher education to the citizens of the area. Loras later became president of the college. His statue on campus was removed on September 8, 2020 after it was discovered he was a slave owner from 1836 to 1852. The college has functioned under several different names: Saint Raphael&#x27;s Seminary and later Saint Raphael&#x27;s Academy (1839–1850), Mount St. Bernard&#x27;s College and Seminary (1850–1873), St. Joseph&#x27;s College (1873–1914), Dubuque College (1914–1920), and Columbia College (1920–1939). The present name was adopted during the school&#x27;s centennial in 1939. That same year, the national Catholic honor society, Delta Epsilon Sigma was founded at the college, by Father Fitzgerald. From the time of its founding, the college has devoted its faculty and facilities to an undergraduate program; it conferred the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees.

In 1963, when The Catholic University of America decided to discontinue its branch program of graduate study on the Loras campus, Loras College, realizing the growing need in the locale for study beyond the baccalaureate degree, initiated its Graduate Division offering the Master of Arts degree in some fields.

The College became coeducational in the fall of 1971. In 1973, the Associate of Arts and the Associate of Science degrees were introduced. The Division of Community Education was initiated in 1975.

Both the Undergraduate College and the Graduate Division of Loras College are accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The teacher education program, both at the graduate and undergraduate level, is accredited by the Iowa Department of Education. The undergraduate teacher education program is also accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. The American Chemical Society has approved the undergraduate chemistry program. The Council of Social Work Education has accredited the social work major at the baccalaureate level.

==Academics==
Loras offers 49 majors, 11 stand-alone minors, and nine pre-professional programs for undergraduates. Undergraduates can also participate in summer classes, internships, field experience, study abroad, and other programs.

For graduate programs, Loras offers a Master of Arts in clinical or general psychology, school counseling, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Education, and a master&#x27;s degree Business Administration with a focus on business analytics.

==Athletics==
Loras&#x27; athletic teams are known as the Duhawks, a name bestowed upon the football team by a &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; scribe in 1924 converging Dubuque and Hawks. The school fields 23 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s varsity teams in the NCAA Division III. They are a member of the American Rivers Conference (ARC). Loras’ colors are Purple, Rah Rah Gold, and Metallic Gold. The men&#x27;s soccer team has advanced to the NCAA Division III Final Four five times since 2007, and once to the NCAA Division III Championship game in 2015. Denise Udelhofen (&#x27;90) serves as the director of athletics for the Duhawks and is assisted by head men&#x27;s soccer coach and director of soccer operations, Dan Rothert (&#x27;96). Jim Naprstek (&#x27;13) serves as the director of athletic communications for the Duhawks after his hiring in March 2014.

==Campus==

Loras sits on a campus located atop several hills in Dubuque. The grounds are bounded by Loras Boulevard on the south, Kirkwood Street on the north, Henion Street on the east, and Alta Vista Street on the west. The campus is surrounded by residential neighborhoods on all sides, some of which are among the most historic in the city. The college consists of 23 buildings, two athletic fields, a stadium, and five tennis courts. Because of its high location, several of the buildings provide excellent views of Downtown Dubuque and the Mississippi River.

Some of the more notable buildings include:
* Athletic Wellness Center: Built in 2007–2008, the athletic wellness center provides a home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams as well as the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball team, as well as men&#x27;s wrestling. In addition, a cardio-vascular center, upgraded weight room and training room, as well as state-of-the-art locker rooms makes the &#x27;AWC&#x27; a great improvement from &quot;The Fieldhouse.&quot;

* Academic Resource Center: The ARC is home to the campus&#x27; main library, including some 355,000 items. The building also includes the bookstore, and other academic uses.
* Alumni Campus Center: At the center of campus, the Alumni Campus Center is a multi-function building, and includes the student union, dining hall, and meeting rooms.
* Christ the King Chapel: The main chapel on campus, built in 1946, is decorated in a pre-Vatican II Streamline Moderne architectural style. The chapel holds daily Mass, Thursday night Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament and Reconciliation, and Mass Sunday night with student lectors, cantors, musicians, extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, greeters, acolytes, and sacristans. The building connects to Keane Hall via a skywalk between the two buildings. The chapel is also the final resting place of Father Aloysius Schmitt, the first chaplain killed during World War II.
* Hoffmann Hall: Hoffmann Hall is Loras&#x27; oldest standing building, with parts of the building built in 1902. It includes a tall clock tower, and houses various academic uses, a beautiful pre-Vatican II architectural-themed adoration chapel named St. Joseph&#x27;s, along with St. Joseph&#x27;s Auditorium. The auditorium is the home of the Loras Players, the oldest continually running theater group west of the Mississippi River. The stage in the auditorium features a turntable.
* Keane Hall: Keane Hall is the most visible building on campus, sitting at the peak of the highest hill in the city. Designed by celebrated architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, the building is multi-use, and includes administrative offices, academics, and faculty offices.
* The Visitation Complex: The Visitation is the former convent of the Visitation Sisters that now houses the school&#x27;s classes in art and music. Gallagher Hall is where most recitals take place, and the building houses an art museum and practice space for musicians.

==Expansion==
The college has been expanded over the years. The Alumni Campus Center was built in 1992, and added a new library in 2001. The Academic Resource Center contains a collection of approximately 355,000 items and 11,000 magazine subscriptions. In addition to its broad general collection, the library contains a rich heritage in its special collections of rare books, as well as the photographs and manuscripts in the Center for Dubuque History located in the lower level of the library. The library is also an official document depository for both the United States government and the state of Iowa. The previous library, Wahlert Memorial Library, was remodeled into classroom space.

The college has purchased Cox Street which runs through campus from the city of Dubuque for $50,000. The school has since shut the street down and replaced it with a pedestrian friendly walk way to improve pedestrian safety and help upgrade the area aesthetically. In 2015, a school spirit shop, The Duhawk Shop, and Einstein Bros. Bagels opened at the corner of Loras Boulevard and the new Loras Parkway.

==St. Pius X Seminary==
St. Pius X Seminary is run under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. The seminary prepares Minor (College) Seminarians for the priesthood, specifically preparing candidates for entrance into Major Seminary &amp; Theological studies. Through Loras, the seminary provides full training in Philosophical studies, while giving students the necessary religious studies courses required for entrance into Major Seminary. The seminary has operated under various names and conditions at Loras College since 1839 until adopting its present name in 1954. St. Pius X has prepared countless Seminarians across Iowa &amp; surrounding states for the priesthood, counting over 30 Bishops as alumni. Currently, the seminary is housed at the Vianney House and serves Seminarians of the Archdiocese of Dubuque and the Diocese of Des Moines. The current rector of St. Pius X Seminary is Fr. David Schatz and the spiritual director is Fr. Tom McDermott.

==Transportation==
The college is located west of downtown Dubuque and served by The Jule transit system. The &quot;Blue Route&quot;, &quot;Orange Route&quot; and &quot;AM Commuter East Route&quot; stop on Loras Boulevard at the south edge of campus.

<doc id="396857" wikidata="Q7345257" url="?curid=396857" title="Robert Harley (1579–1656)">
<text>Sir Robert Harley (baptised 1 March 1579 – 6 November 1656) was an English statesman who served as Master of the Mint for Charles I. A devout Puritan, he supported Parliament in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.

==Life==
He was the son of Thomas Harley of Brampton Bryan Castle in Herefordshire and his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Andrew Corbet. He entered Oriel College, Oxford in 1595, earning a BA in 1599. He entered Middle Temple in 1599. He was invested as a Knight of the Bath on 25 July 1603.

After his first marriage in 1603, he served in various local offices in Herefordshire and Radnorshire, including representing Radnor in Parliament in 1604, Herefordshire in 1624 and 1626 and Evesham in 1628. In 1623 he had married Brilliana, daughter of Sir Edward Conway, one of the Secretaries of State, and acted as his aide in Parliament. He was rewarded for this by being appointed Master of the Mint. He was deprived of this office in 1635 but reinstated in 1643. During this period, his attitude was more that of a country gentleman than of a courtier.

In religion (like Brilliana), Harley was a puritan, taking an anti-Catholic and later also anti-Arminian line. He was successively elected to both Parliaments in 1640 (Short Parliament and Long Parliament), where he opposed ship money, Laudian ecclesiastical innovations and the Scottish War. This led him to join the Parliamentary party. Harley was in charge of the Committee for the Demolition of Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry, and presided over the destruction of a great deal of religious art and architecture.

He was an active member of that party both in Parliament and in Herefordshire, Brampton Bryan Castle undergoing siege in 1643 and 1644. On 30 September 1642, Parliamentarians led by Harley and Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford occupied Hereford without opposition. In December, they withdrew to Gloucester because of the presence in the area of a Royalist army under Lord Herbert.

His support for reconciliation with the king led to his being excluded from the House of Commons in Pride&#x27;s Purge. He and his son Edward, a colonel in the Parliamentarian army, were imprisoned until after the king&#x27;s execution. He resigned as Master of the Mint in May 1649 and took no further part in politics.

He left several sons, his heir Edward being the father of Queen Anne&#x27;s Lord Treasurer, Robert Harley, who was raised to the peerage as the Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer.

<text>Charles Crocker (September 16, 1822 – August 14, 1888) was an American railroad executive who was one of the founders of the Central Pacific Railroad, which constructed the westernmost portion of the first transcontinental railroad, and took control with partners of the Southern Pacific Railroad.

==Early years==
Crocker was born in Troy, New York on September 16, 1822. He was the son of Eliza (née Wright) and Isaac Crocker, a modest family. They joined the nineteenth-century migration west and moved to Indiana when he was 14, where they had a farm. Crocker soon became independent, working on several farms, a sawmill, and at an iron forge.

At the age of 23, in 1845, he founded a small, independent iron forge of his own. He used money saved from his earnings to invest later in the new railroad business after moving to California, which had become a boom state since the Gold Rush. His older brother Edwin B. Crocker had become an attorney by the time Crocker was investing in railroads.

==Founding a railroad==

In 1861, after hearing an intriguing presentation by Theodore Judah, he was one of the four principal investors, along with Mark Hopkins, Collis Huntington and Leland Stanford (also known as The Big Four), who formed the Central Pacific Railroad, which constructed the western portion of the First transcontinental railroad in North America. His position with the company was that of construction supervisor and president of Charles Crocker &amp; Co., a Central Pacific subsidiary founded expressly for the purpose of building the railroad.

Crocker bought train plows to plow the tracks of snow through the mountains, but they derailed due to ice on the tracks. He had more than of snow sheds built to cover the tracks in the Sierra Nevada mountains, to prevent the tracks from getting covered with snow in the winter. This project cost over $2 million.

In 1864, Charles asked his older brother Edwin to serve as legal counsel for the Central Pacific Railroad.

While the Central Pacific was still under construction in 1868, Crocker and his three associates acquired control of the Southern Pacific Railroad. It built the westernmost portion of the second transcontinental railroad. Deming, New Mexico, is named after his wife, Mary Ann Deming Crocker. A silver spike was driven here in 1881 to commemorate the meeting of the Southern Pacific with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads, completing the construction of the second transcontinental railroad in the United States.
On September 5, 1876, at the Lang Southern Pacific Station, a California Historic Landmark, Crocker hammered a golden spike into a railroad tie, the ceremonial spike was driven to celebrate the completion of San Joaquin Valley rail line. The completion of the line connected the City of Los Angeles with San Francisco and First transcontinental railroad line.

===Banking===
Crocker was briefly the controlling shareholder of Wells Fargo in 1869 and served as president. After he sold down, he was replaced by John J. Valentine, Sr. Crocker also acquired controlling interest for his son William in Woolworth National Bank, which was renamed Crocker-Anglo Bank.

In 1963, Crocker-Anglo Bank merged with Los Angeles&#x27; Citizens National Bank, to become Crocker-Citizens Bank and later, Crocker National Bank. The San Francisco-based bank no longer exists, as it was acquired by Wells Fargo in 1986.
==Nob Hill and the 40 foot tall spite fence==
Crocker built a mansion on Nob Hill, San Francisco. When his attempts to buy Nicholas Yung&#x27;s adjacent property were rebuffed, he built a 40-foot spite fence around three sides of the neighbor&#x27;s property. Legal challenges to the fence were unavailing. The feud lasted many years, and the fence was only removed after the death of Mrs. Yung, and the sale of the property by Yung&#x27;s heirs to Crocker&#x27;s family. Spite fences were thereafter made illegal in San Francisco. The mansion was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Though the disaster rendered the infamous dispute and its resolution moot, Crocker&#x27;s family donated the entire block of land to charity, in support of the Episcopal Diocese of California. In 1910, in the same plot where the fence stood, the cornerstone was laid for Grace Cathedral.

==Personal life==
In 1852, Crocker was married to Mary Ann Deming. Mary was the daughter of John Jay Deming and Emily (née Reed) Deming. Together, they had six children, four of whom survived to adulthood:

* Charles Frederick Crocker (1854–1897), who married Jennie Ella Easton (1858–1887).
* George Crocker (1856–1909), who married Emma Hanchett (1855–1904).
* Harriet Valentine Crocker (1859–1935), who married Charles Beatty Alexander (1849–1927).
* William Henry Crocker (1861–1937), who married Ethel Sperry (1861–1934).

Crocker was seriously injured in a New York City carriage accident in 1886, never fully recovered, and died two years later on August 14, 1888. He was buried in a mausoleum located on &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot; at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California. The massive granite structure was designed by the New York architect A. Page Brown, who later designed the San Francisco Ferry Building. Crocker&#x27;s estate has been valued at between $300 million and $400 million at the time of his death in 1888.

During his lifetime Charles Crocker amassed a considerable collection of works of art.

===Honors===
Mount Crocker is named in his honor. It is located in California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada mountains.

<doc id="396895" wikidata="Q1054325" url="?curid=396895" title="St. Clair River">
<text>The St. Clair River is a river in central North America which flows from Lake Huron into Lake St. Clair, forming part of the international boundary between Canada and the United States and between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Michigan. The river is a significant component in the Great Lakes Waterway, whose shipping channels permit cargo vessels to travel between the upper and lower Great Lakes. The St. Clair Delta, also called the St. Clair Flats, is the largest freshwater delta in the world.

==Location==
The river, which some consider a strait, flows in a southerly direction, connecting the southern end of Lake Huron to the northern end of Lake St. Clair. It branches into several channels near its mouth at Lake St. Clair, creating a broad delta region known as the St. Clair Flats. Like a strait, the river serves as a narrow strip of water which connects two larger bodies of water.

==Size==
The river is long and drops in elevation from Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair. The flow rate averages around , and the drainage area is . This takes into account the combined drainage areas of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior.

==History==
Generations of indigenous cultures traveled by canoe on the lakes and rivers in this area, carrying on trade across the region and continent.

In the 18th century, French &quot;voyageurs&quot; and &quot;coureurs des bois&quot; traveled on the river to trade with the Ojibwa and other regional Native Americans and transport furs in canoes to major posts of French and British traders, including Fort Detroit, built in 1701 downriver from Lake St. Clair on the Detroit River. European demand for American furs, especially beaver, was high until the 1830s.

During the mid-19th century and later, Port Huron and Marine City, Michigan, became major shipbuilding centers, especially the latter. Lumber harvested on The Thumb of Michigan was shipped downriver as log rafts to Detroit for processing and export both domestically and internationally. The wooden ships built along the river carried migrants and immigrants up the river and west through the upper Great Lakes on their way to new homes in the American West. Their farms later shipped out grain to eastern markets as part of the developing area.

Beginning in the late 19th century, iron ore mined in the Mesabi Range, copper and grain were carried east through the lakes by lake freighters, increasingly made of steel in the 20th century, traveled throughout the Great Lakes, transporting commodities such as iron ore from the Mesabi Range, copper, and grain, all products of settlers&#x27; labor. Iron was taken to Ashtabula, Ohio and other industrial cities for processing and steel manufacture, and grain was often shipped through to major eastern markets such as Cleveland and New York City.

From the late 19th century, lake steamers carried passengers and traveled among the small towns along the St. Clair and Detroit rivers, and around the Great Lakes. At one time 31 lines operated, but with the rise of automobile use in the 20th century, they gradually declined.

==Watersheds==

The St. Clair River and its Lambton County tributaries in Ontario contribute to the watershed. This figure does not include the Sydenham River watershed. In Michigan, the Black, Pine, and Belle rivers drain in Lapeer, Macomb, Sanilac, and St. Clair counties; the watersheds around Bunce Creek and Marine City are relatively small.

==Islands==

* Stag Island lies between Corunna, Ontario and Marysville, Michigan.
* Fawn Island is near Port Lambton, Ontario and Marine City, Michigan.
* Walpole, Seaway, Bassett, Squirrel, Pottowatamie, St. Anne, Dickinson, Russell and Harsens islands are located in the delta where the St. Clair River flows into Lake St. Clair near Algonac, Michigan. These islands are part of the &quot;St. Clair Flats&quot;, the only major river delta in the Great Lakes. Six of the islands in this delta are unceded territory that are part of the Walpole Island First Nations, whose members include Ojibwe (Anishinaabe), Potowatomi, and Odawa peoples. They call this delta area &quot;Bkejwanong&quot;, meaning &quot;where the waters divide&quot;.

==Land usage==
Most of the watershed away from the river in Ontario and Michigan is used for agriculture. There were numerous sugar beet farms in the flatlands, and an annual beet market was held in Marine City, Michigan, for years at harvest time. Many of the 19th-century English immigrants to this area came from Lincolnshire, England, where sugar beets were a major commodity crop in the 19th and 20th centuries.

A few forest and wetland areas have survived. Their area has declined significantly since European-American settlement, clearing, and development of cultivated fields for various agricultural crops.

Much of the shoreline on both sides of the St. Clair River is urbanized and extensively industrialized. Intensive development has occurred in and near the adjacent cities of Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario, at the northern end of the river. The most dense concentration of industry, including a large petrochemical complex, lies along the Ontario shore south of Sarnia. Historically Sarnia was founded as a fur trading post.

Several communities along the St. Clair rely on the river as their primary source of drinking water. About one-third to one-half of the residents of Michigan receive their water from the St. Clair/Detroit River waterway. Industries including petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturers, paper mills, salt producers, and electric power plants also need high-quality water for their operations. Since the late 20th century and passage of environmental laws to protect air and water quality, there have been occasional incidents when some of these industries have illegally contaminated river waters after discharging pollutants. Major clean-up activities were required.

==Land habitat==

Land areas of the St. Clair River shoreline and flats consist of two biological zones: upland and transitional, both of which are normally above the water table, but which may be flooded periodically.

The upland forests consist of deciduous species, many of which are near their northern climatic limit. Most pre-European settlement trees have been cleared for agriculture, industry, or urbanization. Remaining forest stands, such as oak savannas as well as lakeplain prairies, are found along the southern reaches of the river, particularly on the islands of the St. Clair River Delta and on the Michigan shore in Algonac State Park.

Transitional species are abundant in the low-lying regions, categorized as shrub ecotones, wet meadows, sedge marshes, and island shorelines and beaches. This habitat is home to water and land mammals, including humans, as well as songbirds, waterfowl, insects, pollinators, reptiles, and amphibians.

==Water habitat==

The aquatic habitat of the St. Clair River ranges from deep and fast near the Blue Water Bridge to shallow and slow in the lower river near its discharge point into Lake St. Clair.

Each area provides a unique habitat for aquatic life:
* macrophytes (visible marine plants),
* benthic macroinvertebrates (organisms that live at the bottom of a lake or stream),
* phytoplankton and zooplankton (floating plants and animals),
* emergent vegetation (plants seen above the water surface),
* fish (from minnows to large sport fish).

==Area of concern==
The St. Clair River is a binational Area of Concern (AOC) that borders both the United States and Canada. An AOC is an area within the Great Lakes, that has suffered from environmental destruction. The St. Clair River has been considered an AOC because conventional pollutants such as bacteria, heavy metals, toxic organics, contaminated sediment, fish consumption advisories, impacted animal and plant life, and beach closings.

The United States found that 10 out of 14 of the beneficial use impairments (BUI) were impaired, which would lead to a $21 million investment from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. After several habitat projects, only two impairments exists: the Restrictions on Fish and Wildlife Consumption and the Restrictions on Drinking Water Consumption or Taste and Odor Problems.

=== Beneficial use impairments ===
A beneficial use impairment is a change within the physical, biological, and chemical consistency that causes significant environmental degradation. The St. Clair River has undergone several projects and clean up to remove the BUIs that affected the area. There are currently only 2 BUIs left on the St. Clair River, and once those 2 are removed, the river might go through the delisting process.

==== List of beneficial use impairments that has impacted the St. Clair River ====

* Restrictions on fish and wildlife consumption
* Restrictions on drinking water consumption, or taste and odor
* Tainting of fish and wildlife flavor – REMOVED 2010
* Restriction on dredging activities – REMOVED 2011
* Added costs to agriculture or industry – REMOVED 2012
* Degradation of aesthetics – REMOVED 2012
* Degradation of benthos – REMOVED 2015
* Beach closings – REMOVED 2016
* Bird or animal deformities or reproduction problems – REMOVED 2017
* Loss of fish and wildlife habitat – REMOVED 2017

The St. Clair River AOC includes the entire river, from the Blue Water Bridge at the north end, to the southern tip of Seaway Island, west to St. Johns Marsh and east to include the north shore of Mitchells Bay on Lake St. Clair. Anchor Bay is not included.

Through the Great Lakes Agreement, a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) was created to initiate cleanup measures. Its background report noted the adverse effects of pollution in the river and lakes:

* Restrictions on fish consumption
* Bird and animal deformities
* Degradation of benthos
* Restrictions on dredging activities
* Restrictions on drinking water consumption
* Beach closings
* Degradation of aesthetics
* Added cost to agriculture and industry
* Loss of fish and wildlife habitat

According to the Stage 1 Remedial Action Plan (RAP), the reasons for the Loss of Fish and Wildlife Habitat beneficial use impairment (BUI) in the St. Clair River were general loss of the aquatic plant community due to industrial, agricultural, recreational, and urban developments. A large blob of perchloroethylene was found at the bottom of the St Clair River due to runoff from Dow Chemical Corp in 1985. It remains there, slowly mixing with the water.

The RAP for the St. Clair River AOC was initiated in 1985. A bi-national group called the RAP Team, which included representatives from federal, state, and provincial governments of both Canada and the United States was established in 1987 to develop the plan and to ensure adequate and appropriate public involvement.

==Erosion and Great Lakes drainage==
Federal officials have long acknowledged that dredging and riverbed mining in the St. Clair dropped the long-term average of Great Lakes Huron and Michigan by about 16 inches. A bi-national Great Lakes water-level study concluded in 2013 that unexpected erosion since the last major St. Clair dredging project in the early 1960s has dropped the lakes&#x27; long-term average by an additional 3 to 5 inches. Today, these lakes are nearly 2 feet lower than before human modifications to the riverbed of the St. Clair River. This record low has raised concerns about the long-term health of the lakes. Activists urge remediation to slow the flow of waters through the St. Clair River and out of the lake system, to restore former water levels. However, as of October 2020, the Lake Huron water is averaging 581.5 feet above sea level, which is considerably above the Datum of 577.5 feet, and above the Mean Long-Term Water Level of 578.8 feet.

<doc id="396897" wikidata="Q4905721" url="?curid=396897" title="Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)">
<text>&quot;The Big Four&quot; was the name popularly given to the famous and influential businessmen, and railroad tycoons — also called robber barons — who funded the Central Pacific Railroad (C.P.R.R.), which formed the western portion through the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains of the First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States, built from the mid-continent at the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean during the middle and late 1860s.

Composed of Leland Stanford (1824–1893), Collis Potter Huntington (1821–1900), Mark Hopkins Jr. (1813–1878), and Charles Crocker (1822–1888), the four themselves, however, personally preferred to be known as &quot;The Associates.&quot;

They enriched themselves using tax money and land grants, while heavily influencing the state legislature from within the Republican Party (Stanford was governor of California when the first of the Pacific Railroad Acts was passed.), and through monopolizing tactics. Contemporary critics claimed they were the greatest swindlers in U.S. history.

==Membership==
*Leland Stanford (1824–1893) – C.P.R.R. President, Stanford University founder.
*Collis Potter Huntington (1821–1900) – C.P.R.R. Vice President, for whom the city of Huntington, West Virginia was named. He is also the uncle of Henry E. Huntington (1850–1927), founder of the famous Huntington Library with its art galleries and gardens in San Marino, California.
*Mark Hopkins Jr. (1813–1878) – C.P.R.R. Treasurer
*Charles Crocker (1822–1888) – Construction Supervisor, President of Charles Crocker &amp; Co., a C.P.R.R. subsidiary, later founder of the larger, more extensive Southern Pacific Railroad, another transcontinental link to the east, built later in 1883.

Collectively, the four established the Sacramento Library Association for the state capital in Sacramento, California in 1857, which later established the present Sacramento Public Library.

David Hewes, an enterprising businessman, was called the &quot;maker of San Francisco&quot; for his work in clearing land for development. He was invited to be a part of the &quot;Big Four&quot; but declined due to the financial risks. Over his lifetime he gained and lost several fortunes.

In their time, the four men were sometimes referred to as nabobs or &quot;nobs,&quot; a reference to their wealth and influence. When the four built mansions in the same neighborhood of San Francisco, the area quickly became known as Nob Hill, a name it carries today.

== In popular culture ==

In Henry T. Williams&#x27; &quot;The Pacific tourist – Williams&#x27; illustrated trans-continental guide of travel, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean&quot; published in 1878, the Big Four was replaced by the Five Associates or Representative Men of the Central Pacific Railroad, with Charles Crocker&#x27;s older brother Judge Edwin B. Crocker (1818–1875), who served as the CPRR attorney from 1865 to 1869, added.

Ambrose Bierce lampooned the &quot;Big Four&quot; in his work &quot;Black Beetles in Amber&quot;, a collection of satirical verses attacking various prominent Californians. In &quot;The Birth of the Rail&quot;, &quot;road agents&quot; (bandits) Happy Hunty (Huntington), Cowboy Charley (Crocker), and Leland The Kid (Stanford), joined by minor devil Sootymug (Hopkins), give up robbing stage coaches for the much greater loot of railroad operation.

<doc id="396903" wikidata="Q332499" url="?curid=396903" title="Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer">
<text>Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, KG PC FRS (5 December 1661 – 21 May 1724) was a British statesman of the late Stuart and early Georgian periods. He began his career as a Whig, before defecting to a new Tory ministry. He was raised to the peerage of Great Britain as an earl in 1711. Between 1711 and 1714 he served as Lord High Treasurer, effectively Queen Anne&#x27;s chief minister. He has been called a &quot;prime minister&quot;, although it is generally accepted that the de facto first minister to be a prime minister was Robert Walpole in 1721.

The central achievement of Harley&#x27;s government was the negotiation of the Treaty of Utrecht with France in 1713, which brought an end to twelve years of English and Scottish involvement in the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1714 Harley fell from favour following the accession of the first monarch of the House of Hanover, George I, and was for a time imprisoned in the Tower of London by his political enemies.

He was also a noted literary figure, serving as a patron of both the October Club and the Scriblerus Club. Harley Street is sometimes said to be named after him, although it was his son Edward Harley who actually developed the area.

==Early life: 1661–1688==
Harley was born in Bow Street, London, in 1661, the eldest son of Sir Edward Harley, a prominent landowner in Herefordshire and his wife Abigail Stephens and the grandson of Sir Robert Harley and his third wife, the celebrated letter-writer Brilliana, Lady Harley. He was educated at Shilton, near Burford, in Oxfordshire, in a small school which produced at the same time a Lord High Treasurer (Harley himself), a Lord High Chancellor (Lord Harcourt) and a Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas (Lord Trevor). Harley then spent some time at Foubert&#x27;s Academy, but disliked it. He entered the Middle Temple on 18 March 1682, but was never called to the bar.

The principles of Whiggism and Nonconformism were taught to him at an early age, and he never formally abandoned his family&#x27;s religious opinions, although he departed from them in politics.

His father was wrongly imprisoned for suspected support for the 1685 Monmouth rebellion. Harley wrote afterwards that &quot;we are not a little rejoiced&quot; at Monmouth&#x27;s defeat.

==Glorious Revolution: 1688–1689==
During 1688 Harley acted as his father&#x27;s agent in promoting support for William, Prince of Orange and the Protestant cause against the policies of James II. When William landed in England on 5 November, Sir Edward Harley and his son immediately raised a troop of horse in support of the cause of William III, and took possession of the city of Worcester on his behalf. Harley was sent to report to William, meeting him at Henley. Harley obtained a commission as a major of militia foot in Herefordshire, which he held for several years.

==Backbench member of parliament: 1689–1701==
This recommended Robert Harley to the notice of the Boscawen family, and led to his election, in April 1689, as the parliamentary representative of Tregony, a borough under their control, whilst at the same time acting as High Sheriff of Herefordshire. He sat for Tregony for one parliament, after which, in 1690, he was elected by the constituency of New Radnor, which he represented until his elevation to the peerage in 1711. From an early age, Harley paid particular attention to the conduct of public business, taking special care over the study of the forms and ceremonies of the House of Commons.

Harley supported the Toleration Bill during its passage through the Commons and he hoped for &quot;an equal settlement of religion&quot; to be achieved by the inclusion of Presbyterians in the Church of England. However, this was not adopted. He also helped to defeat a Tory amendment to the Bill of Rights that would have enabled James II&#x27;s son James Francis Edward Stuart to inherit the crown if he converted to Protestantism. On 14 May, Harley delivered his maiden speech in which he reminded the House of recent Tory persecutions (such as the harsh punishment of Monmouth&#x27;s followers) and said that this injustice must be remedied.

After a series of French victories in Flanders during the early years of the Nine Years&#x27; War, Harley believed that the subordination of English soldiers to Dutch officers was the cause of the heavy English casualties. He, therefore, proposed a motion that future appointments of English foot regiments should be manned by Englishmen, which the House passed on 23 November 1692. He also opposed Lord Somers&#x27; proposed Abjuration Bill. If passed, this would have compelled office-holders to take an oath against recognising James II as the lawful king upon penalty of dismissal and imprisonment on the first refusal, with the penalties of high treason upon the second refusal.

During the early 1690s, Harley became a leader, second only to Paul Foley, of the &#x27;Old Whigs&#x27; who were willing to cooperate with Tories in pursuing &#x27;Country Party&#x27; measures against the ministerial or court Whigs in office, the so-called Whig Junto. In December 1690 he was elected to the Commission of Public Accounts to &quot;examine, take and state&quot; the accounts of the realm since William&#x27;s accession, as expenditure had ballooned.

Harley supported a Bill to exclude from the Commons holders of government office and placemen in an effort to weaken court patronage. In taking part in the debates, Harley wrote: &quot;I hope we have shown the parts of honest men and lovers of our country&quot;. He also supported the Triennial Bill to limit the maximum life of a Parliament to three years. In the Commons in early 1693, he claimed that long parliaments were not as representative as short-lived ones and he drew from his pocket a copy of King William&#x27;s Declaration of 1688 in which he had promised frequent parliaments.

In 1696 Harley advocated the founding of a Land Bank that would serve the agricultural interest as the Bank of England served the monied interest.

After the general election of 1698, Harley emerged as the leader of the combined Country Whig-Tory opposition alliance against the Junto, or what Harley called the &#x27;New Country Party&#x27;. Also in this year, he began his association with Sidney Godolphin, and through him ultimate entry into the circle around Princess Anne.

In November 1698 and in January 1700 Harley was approached by the ministry to accept office in the government, on the latter occasion being offered the Secretaryship of State. He refused on both occasions as he did not want to serve with the Whigs. Upon the death of Anne&#x27;s only surviving child, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, in July 1700, King William III became concerned with the succession. William believed it was imperative that the crown should go to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, or her descendants, should Anne die without child. He wrote to Harley and summoned him to an audience, where he asked Harley what demands the Commons would make in order to be persuaded to pass a Bill incorporating the new line of succession. It was agreed that the Bill would include further limitations of the monarch&#x27;s power. Afterwards, William approved his election as Speaker of the House of Commons.

==Speaker of the House of Commons: 1701–1705==
After the general election of February 1701, he held the office of Speaker during three consecutive Parliaments until March 1705. From 18 May 1704, he combined this office with that of the Secretary of State for the Northern Department, displacing The Earl of Nottingham.

As Speaker of the first Parliament, Harley oversaw the passage of the Act of Settlement 1701, as previously agreed with King William. Harley was pleased that both the Whigs and the Tories had agreed on placing further limits on the power of the crown and he was reported to have said that &quot;he hoped in a little time our infamous distinctions and parties, but particularly Jacobitism, should be wholly abolished and extirpated&quot;.

==Northern Secretary: 1704–1708==
Harley was an early practitioner of &#x27;spin&#x27;; he recognised the political importance of careful management of the media. In 1703 Harley first made use of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s talents as a political writer. This proved so successful that he was later to employ both Delarivier Manley and Jonathan Swift to pen pamphlets for him for use against his many opponents in politics.

During the time of his office, the Act of Union 1707 with Scotland was brought about. At the time of his appointment as Secretary of State, Harley had given no outward sign of dissatisfaction with the Whigs, and it was mainly through Marlborough&#x27;s influence that he was admitted to the ministry.

For some time, so long indeed as the victories of the great English general cast a glamour over the policy of his friends, Harley continued to act loyally with his colleagues. But in the summer of 1707, it became evident to Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin that some secret influence behind the throne was shaking the confidence of the Queen in her ministers. The sovereign had resented the intrusion into the administration of the impetuous Lord Sunderland, and had persuaded herself that the safety of the Church of England depended on the fortunes of the Tories. These convictions were strengthened in her mind by the new favourite Abigail Masham (a cousin of the Duchess of Marlborough through her mother, and of Harley on her father&#x27;s side), whose coaxing contrasted favourably in the eyes of the Queen with the haughty manners of her old friend, the Duchess of Marlborough.

Both the Duchess and Godolphin were convinced that this change in the disposition of the queen was due to the influence of Harley and his relatives, but he was permitted to remain in office. Later, an ill-paid and poverty-stricken clerk, William Gregg, in Harley&#x27;s office, was found to have given the French enemy copies of many documents which should have been kept from the knowledge of all but the most trusted advisers of the court, and it was found that through the carelessness of the head of the department the contents of such papers became the common property of all in his service. The celebrated author Daniel Defoe, then an employee of Harley&#x27;s, had warned that his lax security was an invitation to treason. The Queen was informed by Godolphin and Marlborough that they would no longer serve with Harley. They did not attend her next council, on 8 February 1708, and when Harley proposed to proceed with the business of the day the Duke of Somerset drew attention to their absence. The Queen found herself forced (11 February) to accept the resignations of both Harley and Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke.

Thomson criticizes Harley&#x27;s tenure at the Northern Department, calling him &quot;culpably negligent in the conduct of his business&quot;. In addition to citing the lax security already mentioned, Thomson writes that Harley &quot;so arranged matters that the unhappy clerks in his office could not begin work until midnight or a little before and so were unable to leave till dawn. Even where there was nothing to do, they were kept in attendance until about three in the morning&quot;.

==Opposition: 1708–1710==
Harley was forced from office, but his cousin Abigail, who had recently married, continued in the Queen&#x27;s service. Harley employed her influence without scruple, and not in vain. The cost of the protracted war with France, and the danger to the national church, the chief proof of which lay in the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell, were the weapons which he used to influence the masses of the people. Marlborough himself could not be displaced, but his relations were dismissed from their posts in turn. When the greatest of these, Lord Godolphin, was ejected from office on 10 August 1710, five commissioners to the treasury were appointed; among them was Harley as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1710–1711==
It was the aim of the new chancellor to frame an administration from the moderate members of both parties, and to adopt with but slight changes the policy of his predecessors; but his efforts were doomed to disappointment. The Whigs refused to join an alliance with him, and the Tories, who were successful beyond their wildest hopes at the polling booths, could not understand why their leaders did not adopt a policy more favourable to the interests of their party.

The clamours of the wilder spirits, the country members who met at the October Club, began to be re-echoed even by those who were attached to the person of Harley, when, through an unexpected event, his popularity was restored at a bound. A French refugee, the former abbé La Bourlie (better known by the name of the Marquis de Guiscard), was being examined before the Privy Council of Great Britain on a charge of treason, when he stabbed Harley in the breast with a penknife (8 March 1711). Fortunately for Harley, he had a taste for fine clothes, and on that occasion was wearing an ornate gold brocade waistcoat: it seems that the knife stuck in one of the ornaments. Why Guiscard was allowed to enter the room carrying a weapon is still something of a mystery, but, as the Gregg affair demonstrated, Harley was notoriously lax in matters of security, and it is likely that Guiscard had not been properly searched. To a man in good health, the wounds would not have been serious, but the minister had been suffering from ill health and Swift had penned the prayer, &quot;Pray God preserve his health, everything depends upon it&quot;. The joy of the nation on his recovery knew no bounds. Both Houses presented an address to the crown, a suitable response came from the Queen, and on Harley&#x27;s reappearance in the Lower House, the Speaker made an oration which was spread by broadsheet through the country.

One of the most pressing problems at this time was the major crisis in public finance caused by the need to pay for the war against France. The architect of Great Britain&#x27;s finance was Lord Halifax, and he wrote to Harley on the day that the new Treasury board met: &quot;Your great abilities and your knowledge of the Revenue, will soon make you master of all the business, but how you will restore credit, and find money for the demands that will be upon you exceeds my capacity&quot;. Harley in 1711 created the South Sea Company to handle the national debt—it proved highly successful (at first—the notorious &quot;bubble&quot; began in 1720). He succeeded in restoring confidence under his tenure; whereas the Jacobite invasion scare of 1708 and the alarm caused by the Queen&#x27;s illness in early 1714 both caused runs on the bank, Godolphin&#x27;s fall did not precipitate one.

==Lord High Treasurer: 1711–1714==
On 23 May 1711 the minister became Baron Harley, of Wigmore in the County of Hereford, and Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (the latter, despite its form, being a single peerage). Harley claimed the title of Oxford because of his relationship through marriage to the previous holders, the De Veres. The title of Earl Mortimer was added in case a claim was laid to the Oxford earldom. On 29 May he was appointed Lord Treasurer, and on 25 October 1712 became a Knight of the Garter.

A further attempt was made on his life in November with the Bandbox Plot, in which a hat-box, armed with loaded pistols to be triggered by a thread within the package was sent to him; the assassination attempt was forestalled by the prompt intervention of Jonathan Swift.

With the sympathy which these attempted assassinations had evoked, and with the skill which the Lord Treasurer possessed for conciliating the calmer members of either political party, he passed several months in office without any loss of reputation. He rearranged the nation&#x27;s finances, and continued to support her generals in the field with ample resources for carrying on the campaign, though his emissaries were in communication with the French King, and were settling the terms of a peace independently of England&#x27;s allies. After many weeks of vacillation and intrigue, when the negotiations were frequently on the point of being interrupted, the preliminary peace was signed, and in spite of the opposition of the Whig majority in the House of Lords, which was met by the creation of twelve new peers nicknamed Harley&#x27;s Dozen, the much-vexed Treaty of Utrecht was brought to a conclusion on 31 March 1713. The Whig cry of &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot;, was not sufficient to block Parliamentary approval of the Treaty.
While these negotiations were under discussion, the friendship between Harley (Oxford) and St John, the latter who had become Secretary of State in September 1710, was fast changing into hatred. The latter had resented the rise in fortune which the stabs of Guiscard had secured for his colleague Harley, and when he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron St John and Viscount Bolingbroke, instead of with an Earldom, his resentment knew no bounds. The royal favourite, Abigail, whose husband had been called to the Upper House as Baron Masham, deserted her old friend and relation for his more vivacious rival. The Jacobites found that, although the Lord Treasurer was profuse in his expressions of goodwill for their cause, no steps were taken to ensure its triumph, and they no longer placed reliance on promises which were repeatedly made and repeatedly broken. Even Harley&#x27;s (Oxford&#x27;s) friends began to complain of his dilatoriness, and to find some excuse for his apathy in ill health, aggravated by excess in the pleasures of the table and by the loss of his favourite child. The confidence of Queen Anne was gradually transferred from Oxford to Bolingbroke; on 27 July 1714 the former surrendered his staff as lord treasurer, and on 1 August the queen died.

==Imprisonment: 1715–1717==

On the accession of George I of Great Britain, the defeated minister retired to Herefordshire, but a few months later his impeachment was decided upon and he was committed to the Tower of London on 16 July 1715. He was accused of high treason and high crimes and misdemeanours, with the death penalty a distinct possibility. Many of the charges related to his negotiation of the Treaty of Utrecht. Further charges were added regarding his alleged secret plotting with the Jacobite claimant James. His political allies St John and Ormonde both fled to France before they could be arrested on similar grounds and entered the service of James. Initially, he was in ill health, suffering from pneumonia and was cared for by his wife Sarah who remained with him during the first weeks of his imprisonment.

Not long after he was detained a major Jacobite Rising occurred and was defeated. Interrogators of Jacobite prisoners tried to discover if there was a connection with Harley in the plan, but none could be established. This significantly delayed Harley&#x27;s trial, as priority was given to the leading rebels, several of whom were executed. This may have benefited him as the angry mood amongst Whigs against him had calmed by 1717.

Harley also benefited from the Whig Split between rival factions led by James Stanhope and Robert Walpole. Walpole and his supporters went into opposition and joined with the Tories to attack Stanhope&#x27;s government on many issues.

After an imprisonment of nearly two years, Harley was formally acquitted of the charges of high treason and high crimes and misdemeanours for which he had been impeached two years earlier, and allowed to resume his place among the peers.

==Later life: 1717–1724==
Immediately following his release Oxford was informed by George I that he was no longer welcome at court. He joined with the Tory lords to oppose the new Whig Oligarchy in Parliament, in alliance with the Opposition Whigs. In 1719 they joined together in opposition to Stanhope&#x27;s Peerage Bill which was defeated. After this Lord Oxford increasingly took little part in public affairs, and died almost unnoticed in London on 21 May 1724.

==Literary importance==
Harley&#x27;s importance to literature cannot be overstated. As a patron of the arts, he was notable. As a preservationist, he was invaluable. He used his wealth and power to collect an unparalleled library. He commissioned the creation of ballad collections, such as The Bagford Ballads, and he purchased loose poems from all corners. He preserved Renaissance literature (particularly poetry), Anglo-Saxon literature that was then incomprehensible, and a great deal of Middle English literature. His collection, with that of his son Edward, 2nd Lord Oxford and Mortimer, was sold to Parliament in 1753 for the British Museum by the Countess of Oxford and Countess Mortimer and her daughter, the Duchess of Portland; it is known as the Harley Collection.

When he was in office, Harley promoted the careers of Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and John Gay. He also wrote &quot;with them&quot; as a member of the Scriblerus Club. He, along with The 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, contributed to the literary productions of the Club. His particular talent lay in poetry, and some of his work (always unsigned) has been preserved and may be found among editions of Swift&#x27;s poetry. Additionally, he likely had some hand in the writing of &quot;The Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus,&quot; though it is impossible to tell how much.

In the opinion of the historian David C. Douglas, in Harley&#x27;s time &quot;the whole company of scholars looked up to Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, as the great Maecenas of English medieval learning, and they were right to do so, for he was the correspondent and benefactor of very many of them, and he deserved their gratitude as surely as he earned through his book-collecting the thanks of posterity&quot;.

==Family==

In May 1685 Harley married as his first wife Elizabeth, a daughter of Thomas Foley, and they had four children before she died in November 1691:
* Abigail (1685? - 15 July 1750), who married George Hay, later 8th Earl of Kinnoull in 1709.
* Edward (2 June 1689-16 June 1741), who married Henrietta Cavendish Holles and succeeded as 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer.
* Elizabeth (2 June 1689-20 November 1713), who married Peregrine Osborne, later 3rd Duke of Leeds in 1712; and
* Robert, who died in infancy in 1690.

They lived at Brampton Bryan Hall, which he inherited from his father in 1700.

After Elizabeth&#x27;s death, Harley married Sarah (died 17 June 1737), daughter of Simon Middleton of Edmonton, London, on 18 September 1694. They had no children. He died in 1724 at his house in Albemarle Street, Westminster, and was buried in the churchyard of St Barnabas, Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire.

<text>Sir Henry St John (1590-c.1642) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1621 and 1625.

==Biography==
St John was a younger son of Oliver St John, 3rd Baron St John of Bletso and his wife Dorothy Reid, daughter of Sir John Rede or Reid, of Odington, Gloucestershire. He was knighted on 24 July 1619 at Bletsoe together with his brother Beauchamp, MP. Apart from Beauchamp, four other brothers, Oliver, Rowland, Anthony and Alexander were to become MPs. 

In 1621 St John was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon. He was re-elected MP for Huntingdon in 1624 and again in 1625.

St John died without issue. His eldest brother Oliver inherited the Barony and became Earl of Bolingbroke.

<doc id="396922" wikidata="Q435806" url="?curid=396922" title="China Airlines Flight 611">
<text>China Airlines Flight 611 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (now Taoyuan International Airport) in Taiwan to Hong Kong International Airport in Hong Kong. 

On 25 May 2002, the Boeing 747-209B operating the route disintegrated midair and crashed into the Taiwan Strait, northeast of the Penghu Islands, 20 minutes after takeoff, killing all 225 people on board. The in-flight break-up was caused by metal fatigue cracks resulting from improper repairs after a tailstrike to the aircraft 22 years earlier. This accident is similar to Japan Air Lines Flight 123 which killed 520 people. 

The crash remains the deadliest in Taiwan, as well as the most recent accident with fatalities involving China Airlines, and the second-deadliest accident in China Airlines history, behind China Airlines Flight 140 with 264 fatalities.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved, registered as , (originally registered as B-1866), MSN 21843, was the only Boeing 747-200 passenger aircraft left in China Airlines&#x27;s fleet at the time. The plane was delivered to the airline on 2 August 1979. The aircraft had logged more than 64,800 hours of flight time at the time of the accident. The plane was equipped with 4 Pratt and Whitney JT9D-7AW engines and had a 355-seat configuration. Prior to the crash, China Airlines had sold B-18255 to Orient Thai Airlines for US$1.45 million. The accident flight was to be the aircraft&#x27;s penultimate flight for China Airlines, as it was scheduled to be delivered to Orient Thai Airlines after its return flight from Hong Kong to Taipei. After the crash, the contract to sell the aircraft was voided and Orient Thai replaced it with another 747.
Only four passenger 747-200s were delivered to China Airlines, all from 1979 to 1980. The other three had been in full passenger service until 1999 when they were converted to freighters. They were immediately grounded by the ROC&#x27;s Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) after the crash for maintenance checks.

== Accident ==
The flight took off at 15:08 local time (07:08 UTC), and was scheduled to arrive at Hong Kong at 16:28 Hong Kong Time (08:28 UTC). The flight crew consisted of 51-year-old Captain Yi Ching-Fong, 52-year-old First Officer Shieh Yea Shyong, and 54-year-old Flight Engineer Chao Sen Kuo. All three pilots were highly experienced – both pilots had more than 10,100 hours of flying time and the flight engineer had logged more than 19,100 flight hours.

At 15:16 local time, the flight was cleared to climb to flight level 350—about . At 15:33, contact with the plane was lost. Chang Chia-juch, the Taiwanese Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications at that time, said that two Cathay Pacific aircraft in the area received B-18255&#x27;s emergency location-indicator signals. All 206 passengers and 19 crew members on board the aircraft were killed.

== Passengers ==
The passengers included Taiwanese politician You Jih-cheng. and two reporters from the &quot;United Daily News&quot;. Most of the passengers, 114 people, were members of a Taiwanese group tour to China organised by four travel agencies. 
Of the 225 passengers and crew on board, remains of 175 were recovered and identified. The first 82 bodies were found floating on the ocean surface of the Taiwan Strait, and were recovered by fishing boats and military vessels. Contracted recovery vessels were subsequently used for the recovery of the aircraft wreckage and the remaining bodies.

The victims were identified by visual identification, personal effects, fingerprints, dental examinations, and through DNA testing. Only the three recovered flight crew member bodies were autopsied. The victims&#x27; bodies were photographed and their clothing and possessions were catalogued and returned to the victims&#x27; families. The victims&#x27; records, including body diagrams, injury protocols, photographs, and other documents related to the recovery and identification of the individuals were then correlated for each identified victim.

Most of the victims had extensive injuries consistent with head trauma, tibia and fibula fractures, significant back abrasions, and pelvic injuries. Most of the bodies were nearly intact except, in some cases, for fractured bones. Some of the victims had expansion of lung tissue, subcutaneous emphysema, and bleeding of the nose and mouth. No carbon remains were found on any of the recovered bodies or their clothes, and no sign of fire, burning, or blast damage was found.

== Search, recovery and investigation ==
At 17:05 local time, a military Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft spotted a crashed airliner northeast of Makung, Penghu Islands. Oil slicks were also spotted at 17:05; the first body was found at 18:10. 

No distress signal or communication was sent out prior to the crash. Radar data suggest that the aircraft broke into four pieces whilst at FL 350. This theory is supported by the fact that some lighter articles that would have been found inside the aircraft were found up to from the crash site at villages in central Taiwan. The items included magazines, documents, luggage, photographs, New Taiwan dollars, aircraft safety cards and a China Airlines-embossed, blood-stained pillow case.

The plane was supposed to be leveling off then, as it approached its cruising altitude of . Shortly before the breakup, two of the aircraft&#x27;s four engines began providing slightly higher thrust, which was later found to have been within the normal ranges of deviation. All four engines were recovered from the sea and found not to have suffered any malfunction prior to the crash. Pieces of the aircraft were found in the ocean and on Taiwan, including in the city of Changhua.

The governments of Taiwan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China co-operated in the recovery of the aircraft; the Chinese allowed personnel from Taiwan to search for bodies and aircraft fragments in those parts of the Taiwan Strait controlled by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

China Airlines requested relatives to submit blood samples for DNA testing at the Criminal Investigation Bureau of National Police Administration (now National Police Agency) and two other locations.

The &quot;United Daily News&quot; stated that some relatives of passengers described the existence of this flight to Hong Kong as being &quot;unnecessary&quot;. Most of the passengers intended to arrive in mainland China, but because of a lack of direct air links between Taiwan and mainland China, the travellers had to fly via Hong Kong; the relatives advocated the opening of direct air links between Taiwan and mainland China, which was eventually realised.

== Cause ==

The final investigation report found that the accident was the result of fatigue cracking caused by inadequate maintenance after a much earlier tailstrike incident. On 7 February 1980, the aircraft was flying from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to Taoyuan International Airport via King Abdulaziz International Airport and Kai Tak International Airport as China Airlines Flight 009 (Callsign CAL009, pronounced Dynasty 009). While landing in Hong Kong, part of the plane&#x27;s tail had scraped along the runway. The aircraft was depressurised, ferried back to Taiwan on the same day, and a temporary repair done the day after. A more permanent repair was conducted by a team from China Airlines from 23-26 May 1980.

The permanent repair of the tailstrike was not carried out in accordance with the Boeing Structural Repair Manual (SRM). According to the SRM, repairs could be made by replacing the entire affected skin or by cutting out the damaged portion and installing a reinforcing doubler plate to restore the structural strength. Rather than following the SRM, the China Airlines team installed a doubler over the damaged skin.

Though the kind of damage inflicted on the tail was far beyond the damage that a doubler plate is meant to fix, this accident probably would not have occurred had the doubler been installed properly. This would mean that all of the scratches would be completely contained by the innermost row of fasteners, and the fasteners themselves would be strong enough to stop the propagation of any new and existing fatigue cracks. However, the doubler that was installed on the aircraft was too small, so it failed to completely and effectively cover the damaged area, as scratches were found at, and outside, the outermost row of fasteners securing the doubler. Installing the doubler with scratches remaining outside the rivets provided no protection against the propagation of any concealed cracks beneath the doubler, or worse, in the area between its perimeter and the rows of rivets.

Consequently, after repeated cycles of pressurisation and depressurisation during flight, cracks began to form around the exposed scratches until finally, on 25 May 2002, coincidentally 22 years to the day after the faulty repair was made on the damaged tail, the hull broke open in midair. A rapid decompression occurred once the crack opened up, causing the separation of the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage at section 46 (aft of the main wingbox). The remainder of the aircraft forward of section 46 entered an abrupt descent, causing all four engines to separate from the wings near-simultaneously, as the engine fuse pins failed at about . After this point, the wings and fuselage forward of the initial breakpoint remained connected until impact with the sea.

This was not the first time that a 747 had crashed because of a faulty repair following a tailstrike. On 12 August 1985, 17 years before Flight 611&#x27;s crash and 7 years after the accident aircraft&#x27;s repair, Japan Air Lines Flight 123 from Tokyo to Osaka with 524 people on board had crashed when the vertical stabiliser was torn off and the hydraulic systems severed by explosive decompression, leaving only four survivors. That crash had been attributed to a faulty repair to the rear pressure bulkhead, which had been damaged in 1978 in a tail strike incident. In both crashes, a doubler plate was not installed according to Boeing standards at the time.

China Airlines disputed much of the report, stating that investigators did not find the pieces of the aircraft that would prove the contents of the investigation report. One piece of evidence during the investigation that came up was the discolouration on the damaged section of the tail from photographs from maintenance records. The discolouration was determined to be tar stains from the historic use of cigarettes and cigars. Smoking was permitted onboard China Airlines&#x27; flights until 1995. Had the stains been investigated, the cracks in the fuselage would have been determined, and the plane may have avoided the fateful flight.

== Dramatisation==
The accident was featured in a Season 7 episode of the Canadian documentary &quot;Mayday&quot;, entitled &quot;Scratching the Surface&quot;.

<text>The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are is the debut studio album by hip-hop group the 2 Live Crew. It was released in 1986 on Luke Records to a great deal of controversy and promptly was certified gold by the RIAA. It includes the hits &quot;We Want Some Pussy&quot;, &quot;Throw the &#x27;D&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Cuttin&#x27; It Up&quot;. In Florida, it was deemed obscene, and one store clerk was charged with felony &quot;corruption of a minor&quot; for selling it to a 14-year-old girl. The clerk was later acquitted.

The following year, the album reached number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 128 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<doc id="396928" wikidata="Q1073177" url="?curid=396928" title="China Airlines Flight 642">
<text>China Airlines Flight 642 was a flight that crashed at Hong Kong (Chek Lap Kok) International Airport on 22 August 1999. It was operating from Bangkok (Bangkok International Airport, now renamed as Don Mueang International Airport) to Taipei with a stopover in Hong Kong.

The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (registration , touched down hard during landing, flipped over and caught fire. Of the 315 people on board, 312 survived and three were killed. It was the first fatal accident to occur at the new Hong Kong International airport since it opened in July 1998.

Flight 642 was one of only two hull losses of MD-11s with passenger configuration, the other being Swissair Flight 111, which crashed in 1998 with 229 fatalities. All other hull losses of MD-11s have been when the aircraft has been serving as a cargo aircraft.

== Aircraft and crew ==
The aircraft was a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 registered as B-150, which had been delivered to China Airlines in October 1992. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4460 turbofan engines. B-150 had been involved in an earlier unrelated incident as CAL012 on 7 December 1992 when moderate turbulence led to the aircraft departing normal flight, leading to it sustaining damage to its outboard elevator skin assemblies, some of which broke off from the aircraft. B-150 was then delivered to China Airlines&#x27;s subsidiary Mandarin Airlines in July 1993. It was then returned to China Airlines in March 1999.

The captain was 57-year-old Gerardo Lettich, an Italian national who had joined China Airlines in 1997, and had previously flown for a major European airline. He had 17,900 flight hours, including 3,260 hours on the MD-11. The first officer was 36-year-old Liu Cheng-hsi, a Taiwanese national who had been with the Airline since 1989 and had logged 4,630 flight hours, with 2,780 of them on the MD-11.

== Summary ==
At about 6:43 P.M. local time (10:43 UTC) on 22 August 1999, the MD-11 was making its final approach to runway 25L when Tropical Storm Sam was NE of the airport. At an altitude of prior to touchdown a further wind check was reported to the crew: 320 deg/ gusting to . This resulted in a crosswind vector of gusting to , while the tested limit for the aircraft was .

During the final flare to land, the plane rolled to the right, landed hard on its right main gear and the No. 3 engine touched the runway. The right wing separated from the fuselage. The aircraft continued to roll over and skidded off the runway in flames. When it stopped, it was on its back and the rear of the plane was on fire, coming to rest on a grass area next to the runway, from the runway threshold. The right wing was found on a taxiway from the nose of the plane. As shown in photos of the aircraft at rest, the fire caused significant damage to the rear section of the aircraft but was quickly extinguished due to the heavy rain and quick response from rescue teams in the airport.

Rescue vehicles quickly arrived on the scene and suppressed the fire on and in the vicinity of the aeroplane, allowing rescue of the passengers and crew to progress in very difficult conditions. Two passengers rescued from the wreckage were certified dead on arrival at hospital and one passenger died five days later in hospital. A total of 219 people, including crewmembers, were admitted to hospital, of whom 50 were seriously injured and 153 sustained minor injuries. All 15 crew members survived.

== Investigation ==
The flight data stored in the volatile memory of the aircraft&#x27;s Quick Access Recorder (QAR) during the last of the approach could not be recovered due to the interruption of the power supply at impact. Probable wind variations and the loss of headwind component, together with the early retardation of thrust levers, led to a loss in indicated airspeed just prior to touchdown.

During the final approach, the plane descended along the Instrument Landing System (ILS) glideslope until at about , the crew visually acquired the runway. They disengaged the autopilot but left the autothrottle on. During the flare, the rate of descent was not arrested, the plane landed with the right wing slightly lower. The right landing gear touched down first, the right engine impacted the runway and the right wing was detached from the fuselage. Since the left wing was still attached, the lift from that wing rolled the fuselage onto its right side, and the plane came to rest inverted in the grass strip next to the runway. The spilled fuel caught fire.

Several suggestions were given to China Airlines concerning its training. However, China Airlines disputed the report&#x27;s findings on the flight crews&#x27; actions, citing the weather conditions at the time of the accident and claimed that the aircraft flew into a microburst just before landing, causing it to crash.

== Media ==
The landing and crash of Flight 642 was recorded by nearby occupants in a car which also captured their reactions from the witnesses.

A photo showing a Mandarin Airlines MD-11 taxiing past the remains of Flight 642 was circulated.

The crash was mentioned in Episode 7 of the first Season Extreme Engineering, despite many details being incorrect in the episode.

This disaster was also aired on RTHK&#x27;s &quot;Elite Brigade II&quot; Episode 2 in 2012.

<text>Blerick (; ; ) is a city district of the Dutch municipality of Venlo. It lies on the west bank of the Meuse and its origin goes back to the Roman era as a military stronghold and settlement en route from Mosa Trajectum (Maastricht) to Noviomagus (Nijmegen). Blerick can be found on the Peutinger Table as Blariacum. Up to the second world war Blerick formed together with Baarlo and Maasbree one municipality. Under German rule Blerick became part of the municipality of Venlo.

<doc id="396938" wikidata="Q715209" url="?curid=396938" title="Palladius (bishop of Ireland)">
<text>Palladius (fl. AD 408–431; died 457/461) was the first bishop of the Christians of Ireland, preceding Saint Patrick. It is possible that some elements of their life stories were later conflated in Irish tradition. Palladius was a deacon and member of one of the prominent families in Gaul. Pope Celestine I consecrated him a bishop and sent him to Ireland &quot;to the &quot;Scotti&quot; believing in Christ&quot;.

==Background==
The Palladii were reckoned among the noblest families of France and several of them held high rank about this time in the Church of Gaul.
The Gallo-Roman poet Rutilius Claudius Namatianus, in his poem &quot;De reditu suo&quot;, recounting his voyage from Rome to Gaul in 417, mentions a young relative of his called Palladius, who had been sent from Gaul to Rome to study law. He refers to Palladius&#x27;s father, Exuperantius, as bringing peace, law and freedom to Armorica. Exuperantius was apparently &quot;praefectus praetorio Galliarum&quot; (&quot;Praetorian prefect of the Gallic provinces&quot;) when he was killed in an army mutiny at Arles in 424.

Prosper of Aquitaine in his &quot;Chronicon&quot; mentions a deacon called Palladius, who in 429 urged Pope Celestine I to send bishop Germanus of Auxerre to Britain to bring the Britons back to the Catholic faith. Butler and P.F. Moran say that Palladius was a Deacon of Rome, as it is unlikely that a deacon of Auxerre would exercise the influence in Rome that many have assigned to Palladius; and that it is in accordance with St Prosper&#x27;s usage to indicate the Roman deacon by the simple title &quot;diaconus.&quot; Historian Kathleen Hughes regards it as more probable that he was a deacon of Germanus, and that Germanus sent him to Rome, to request a commission to travel to Britain at the request of the British bishops to help combat Pelagianism.

==Ireland==
In 431, Prosper&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot; records: &quot;Palladius, having been ordained by Pope Celestine, is sent as first bishop to the Scotti believing in Christ&quot;, according to the &quot;Chronicon&quot; of Prosper of Aquitaine. This implies there was already a community of Christians in Ireland, who may have requested a bishop be appointed. Prosper later wrote in his &quot;Contra collatorem&quot; (c. 433) that Celestine, &quot;having ordained a bishop for the Irish, while he labours to keep the Roman island Catholic, he has also made the barbarian island Christian.&quot;

Palladius landed at Arklow. Auxilius, Secundinus, and Iserninus are missioners identified with St. Patrick, but more recent research associates them not with Patrick but with Palladius.

Irish writers who chronicled the life of St Patrick state that St Palladius preached in Ireland before St Patrick, although he was soon banished by the king of Leinster, and returned to North Britain. According to Muirchu (who lived two centuries later) in the &quot;Book of Armagh&quot;, &quot;God hindered him...and neither did those fierce and cruel men receive his doctrine readily, nor did he himself wish to spend time in a strange land, but returned to him who sent him.&quot; Palladius was accompanied by four companions: Sylvester and Solinus, who remained after him in Ireland, and Augustinus and Benedictus, who followed him to Britain but returned to their own country after his death. Palladius is most strongly associated with Leinster, particularly with Clonard, County Meath.
==Scotland==
According to Muirchu, Palladius arrived among the Scots in North Britain after he left Ireland. Scottish church tradition holds that he presided over a Christian community there for about 20 years. A cluster of dedications in the Mearns in Scotland, in the village of Auchenblae, are believed to mark his last resting place. As late as the reign of James V, royal funds were disbursed for the fabrication of a new reliquary for the church there, and an annual &quot;Paldy Fair&quot; was held at least until the time of the Reformation.

==Death==
His date of death is unknown; however, the Annals of Ulster contain the following references:
* 457 &quot;Repose of the elder Patrick, as some books state&quot;
* 461 &quot;Here some record the repose of Patrick&quot;
* 492 &quot;The Irish state here that Patrick the Archbishop died.&quot;
* 493 &quot;Patrick... apostle of the Irish, rested on the 16th day before the Kalends of April...&quot;

Thus, it is possible that later writers confused Palladius and Patrick. If the earlier dates of 457/461 indeed refer to him, then it seems that the actual St Patrick died much later about 492/493. Patrick&#x27;s mission was largely confined to Ulster and Connacht, while Palladius seems to have been active in Leinster, particularly in the area around Clonard.

The Vita tripartita states that he died at &quot;Cell Fine&quot; (thought to be modern-day Killeen Cormac, County Kildare), where he left his books, writing tablet and relics of Peter and Paul. Alban Butler, citing Hector Boethius and Camden, says that he died at Fordun, fifteen miles south of Aberdeen, around the year 450.

<doc id="396940" wikidata="Q1798055" url="?curid=396940" title="LFO (British band)">
<text>LFO was a British electronic music act formed in 1988 consisting of Mark Bell and Gez Varley. They released their acclaimed debut LP &quot;Frequencies&quot; in 1991 on Sheffield label Warp. After Varley left the group in 1996, Bell continued solo to release &quot;Advance&quot; (1996) and &quot;Sheath&quot; (2003). Bell died in October 2014, effectively ending the project. 

LFO are considered to be pioneers of the bass-heavy &quot;bleep techno&quot; style. AllMusic called them &quot;one of British techno&#x27;s most important, agenda-setting groups.&quot;

==History==
===Early years===
Varley and Bell met while studying at Leeds and named their group after the initialism for the common synthesizer function low-frequency oscillation. They gave their first track, the eponymous &quot;LFO&quot;, to Nightmares on Wax. The popularity of the demo in clubs led to the track being released by the Sheffield-based Warp label in 1990, and it was a Top 20 hit in the U.K., reaching number 12 in the singles charts in July.

DJ Martin (Martin Williams) is credited as a cowriter and co-producer of the track &quot;LFO&quot; but was not a member of the group. Mark Bell explains:
We gave a tape of our recordings to DJ Martin who helped loads with arranging our tracks so it&#x27;d work on the dancefloor. We&#x27;d just been messing around with drum machines since we were like thirteen, tapping away at them like they were arcade games, making tapes to play our mates at school. Anyway, DJ Martin would play our cassettes in his sets and people would go mental - in a good way - cos they were totally raw.

The duo of Bell and Varley were both 19 years old when they recorded their debut album &quot;Frequencies&quot; (1991). According to Bell, most of the album was made by him alone because Varley felt &quot;trapped by the confines of Warp&quot; and wanted to make more direct dance music; the credits were nonetheless split 50/50.

The duo later signed to Tommy Boy Records in the U.S. and remixed Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, as well as songs from Björk, Radiohead, Depeche Mode, Laurent Garnier, and The Sabres of Paradise.

===Later years===
In 1996, LFO released their second album, &quot;Advance&quot;. Varley left the group the same year and formed Feedback with Simon Hartley (a.k.a. Wild Planet). Bell produced &quot;Homogenic&quot; (1997) with Björk and performed with her on her 1997 &quot;Homogenic&quot; and 2007/08 &quot;Volta&quot; tours. He also produced &quot;Exciter&quot; (2001) with Depeche Mode.

In 2003, LFO released their third album, &quot;Sheath&quot;, produced alone by Bell.

In 2005, LFO and Aphex Twin collaborated with the EP AFX / LFO.

In 2009 the &quot;Warp20 (Recreated)&quot; compilation featured covers of two early LFO songs, &quot;LFO&quot; by Luke Vibert and &quot;What is House? (LFO Remix)&quot; by Autechre. The original version of &quot;LFO&quot;, albeit the Leeds Warehouse Mix, featured on Warp&#x27;s 10th anniversary album &quot;Warp 10+2: Classics 89–92&quot;.

LFO&#x27;s track &quot;Freak&quot; was used in the opening title sequence for Gaspar Noé&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;Enter the Void&quot;.

In 2014, Bell died from health complications at the age of 43, resulting in the disbandment of the band.

<doc id="396952" wikidata="Q1478700" url="?curid=396952" title="The Australian">
<text>The Australian, with its Saturday edition The Weekend Australian, is a daily newspaper in broadsheet format published by News Corp Australia since 14 July 1964. As the only Australian daily newspaper distributed nationally, its readership of both print and online editions was 2,394,000. Its editorial line has been self-described over time as centre-right.

== Parent companies ==
&quot;The Australian&quot; is published by News Corp Australia, an asset of News Corp, which also owns the sole daily newspapers in Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, and Darwin, and the most circulated metropolitan daily newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne. News Corp&#x27;s chairman and founder is Rupert Murdoch.

&quot;The Australian&quot; integrates content from overseas newspapers owned by News Corp Australia&#x27;s international parent News Corp, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; of London.

== History ==
The first edition of &quot;The Australian&quot; was published by Rupert Murdoch on 15 July 1964, becoming the third national newspaper in Australia following shipping newspaper &quot;Daily Commercial News&quot; (1891) and &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; (1951). Unlike other original Murdoch newspapers, it is not a tabloid publication. At the time, a national paper was considered commercially unfeasible, as newspapers mostly relied on local advertising for their revenue. &quot;The Australian&quot; was printed in Canberra, then plates flown to other cities for copying. From its inception, the paper struggled for financial viability, and ran at a loss for several decades.

A Sunday edition, &quot;The Sunday Australian&quot;, was established in 1971. It was discontinued in 1972, though, because press capacity was insufficient to print &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, and it.

&quot;The Australian&#x27;s&quot; first editor was Maxwell Newton, before leaving the newspaper within a year, and was succeeded by Walter Kommer, and then by Adrian Deamer. Under Deamer&#x27;s editorship, &quot;The Australian&quot; encouraged female journalists, and was the first mainstream daily newspaper to hire an Aboriginal reporter, John Newfong.

During the 1975 election, campaigning against the Whitlam government by its owner led to the newspaper&#x27;s journalists striking over editorial direction.

Editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell was appointed in 2002 and retired on 11 December 2015; he was replaced by Paul Whittaker, formerly the editor-in-chief of Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.

In May 2010, the newspaper launched the first Australian newspaper iPad application.

In October 2011, &quot;The Australian&quot; announced that it was planning to become the first general newspaper in Australia to introduce a paywall, with the introduction of a $2.95/week charge for readers to view premium content on its website, mobile phone, and tablet apps. The paywall was officially launched on 24 October, with a free 3-month trial.

In September 2017, &quot;The Australian&quot; launched a Chinese website.

In October 2018, Chris Dore, former editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;, and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (Western Australia) was announced as taking over as editor-in-chief. After Dore resigned in November 2022, the newspaper appointed its first female editor-in-chief, Michelle Gunn, in January 2023.

The editorial board began investigating a senior editor after allegations of misconduct were raised following events of the papers&#x27; Christmas drinks. The senior editor was accused of inappropriate conduct at the event by multiple female employees.

Since 2019, &quot;The Australian&quot; has published an annual study, called &quot;Australia&#x27;s Richest 250&quot;, which ranks the country&#x27;s wealthiest people from one to 250, in order of their net worth.

== Coverage ==

Daily sections include national news (&quot;The Nation&quot;), world news (&quot;Worldwide&quot;), sport news, and business news (&quot;Business&quot;). Contained within each issue is a prominent opinion/editorial (op/ed) section, including regular columnists and occasional contributors. Other regular sections include technology (&quot;Australian IT&quot;), media (edited by Darren Davidson since 2015), features, legal affairs, aviation, defence, horse-racing (&quot;Thoroughbreds&quot;), the arts, health, wealth, and higher education. A traveland indulgence section is included on Saturdays, along with &quot;The Inquirer&quot;, an in-depth analysis of major stories of the week, alongside much political commentary. Saturday lift-outs include &quot;Review&quot;, focusing on books, arts, film, and television, and &quot;The Weekend Australian Magazine&quot;, the only national weekly glossy insert magazine. A glossy magazine, &quot;Wish&quot;, is published on the first Friday of the month.

&quot;&quot;The Australian&quot; has long maintained a focus on issues relating to Aboriginal disadvantage.&quot; It also devotes attention to the information technology, defence and mining industries, as well as the science, economics, and politics of climate change. It has also published numerous special reports into Australia&#x27;s energy policy, legal affairs, and research sector.

The &quot;Australian Literary Review&quot; was a monthly supplement from September 2006 to October 2011.

The tone and nature of &quot;The Australian&#x27;s&quot; coverage has changed over time, but since the late 20th century under the ownership of Rupert Murdoch and with Chris Mitchell as editor-in-chief, it has taken a markedly conservative direction. It was outspoken in supporting the conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard.

== Editorial and opinion pages ==

Former editor Paul Kelly stated in 1991, &quot;&quot;The Australian&quot; has established itself in the marketplace as a newspaper that supports economic libertarianism&quot;. Laurie Clancy asserted in 2004 that the newspaper &quot;is generally conservative in tone and heavily oriented toward business; it has a range of columnists of varying political persuasions, but mostly to the right.&quot; Former editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell has said that the editorial and op-ed pages of the newspaper are centre-right but &quot;claims it is down the middle in its news coverage&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;Crikey&quot; described the newspaper as generally in support of the Liberal Party of Australia and the then-Coalition government, but has pragmatically supported Labor governments in the past as well. In 2007, &quot;The Australian&quot; announced their support for Kevin Rudd of the Australian Labor Party in the Federal election. As of 2021, the last time the paper endorsed the Labor Party at any level, state or federal, was the 2010 Victorian election. Along with other Australian papers owned by News Ltd, &quot;The Australian&quot; has been highly and repeatedly critical of the Labor Party.

&quot;The Australian&quot; presents varying views on climate change, including articles by those who disagree with the scientific consensus, such as Ian Plimer, and those who agree, such as Tim Flannery and Bjørn Lomborg. A 2011 study of the previous seven years of articles claimed that four out of every five articles were opposed to taking action on climate change.

In 2010, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; presenter Paul Barry accused &quot;The Australian&quot; of waging a campaign against the Australian Greens, and the Greens&#x27; federal leader Bob Brown wrote that &quot;The Australian&quot; has &quot;stepped out of the fourth estate by seeing itself as a determinant of democracy in Australia&quot;. In response, &quot;The Australian&quot; opined that &quot;Greens leader Bob Brown has accused &quot;The Australian&quot; of trying to wreck the alliance between the Greens and Labor. We wear Senator Brown&#x27;s criticism with pride. We believe he and his Green colleagues are hypocrites; that they are bad for the nation; and that they should be destroyed at the ballot box.&quot;

&quot;The Australian&quot; has been described by some media commentators and scholars as working to promote a right-wing agenda, and as a result, encouraging political polarisation in Australia. In August 2019, former &quot;The Australian&quot; journalist Rick Morton who left the paper earlier that year, reported in &quot;The Saturday Paper&quot; that an unpublished study by Victoria University, Melbourne, found that &quot;The Australian&quot; &quot;fuels far-right recruitment&quot; through dog whistle coded language. Victoria University issued a statement that &quot;At no point does the research report claim that News Ltd publication fuelled far-right sentiment.&quot;

In late 2022, editor-in-chief Chris Dore resigned from &quot;The Australian&quot; citing health issues. After acting as editor-in-chief following the departure of Dore, Michelle Gunn become the first female editor-in-chief at the newspaper in January 2023. Gunn was replaced as editor by Kelvin Healey.

==Notable stories==

===AWB kickback scandal===
Caroline Overington, a senior journalist writing for &quot;The Australian&quot;, reported in 2005 about the Australian Wheat Board funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to Iraq and the government of Saddam Hussein before the start of the Iraq War. This story became known as the AWB oil-for-wheat scandal, and resulted in a commission of inquiry into the matter. Overington received a Walkley Award for her coverage.

===Stimulus Watch===

In 2009, &quot;The Australian&quot; ran a large number of articles about the Rudd government&#x27;s Building the Education Revolution policy, which uncovered purported evidence of overpricing, financial waste, and mismanagement of the building of improvements to schools such as halls, gymnasia, and libraries. On the newspaper&#x27;s website, a section named &quot;Stimulus Watch&quot;, subtitled &quot;How your Billions Are Being Spent&quot;, contained a large collection of such articles.

The following year, other media outlets also reported these issues and the policy turned into a political embarrassment for the government, which until then had been able to ignore &quot;The Australian″&quot;s reports. Along with the government&#x27;s insulation stimulus policy, it contributed to criticisms, perceptions of incompetence, and general dissatisfaction with the government&#x27;s performance.

On 16 July 2010, Julia Gillard was reported to have admitted that the school-building program was flawed and that errors had been made because the program was designed in haste to protect jobs during the Great Recession. 

===AWU Affair===

In 2011, Glenn Milne reported on the allegations against Prime Minister Julia Gillard concerning the AWU affair, including a claim regarding Gillard&#x27;s living arrangements with Australian Workers&#x27; Union official Bruce Wilson. Gillard contacted the chief executive of &quot;The Australian&quot;, resulting in the story being removed and an apology and retraction posted in its place.

On 18 August 2012, Hedley Thomas reported that Gillard had left her job as a partner with law firm Slater &amp; Gordon as a direct result of a secret internal investigation in 1995 into corrupt conduct on behalf of her then-boyfriend Ralph Blewett. The story was ignored for a long time by other media outlets until after Gillard held a press conference to respond to the allegations against her. In 2013, the Fair Work Commission commenced initial inquiries into allegations of improper union financial conduct, and the government initiated a judicial inquiry into the AWU affair in December of that year as part of a royal commission into trade unions.

===&quot;The Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;===
&quot;The Teachers Pet&quot;, an investigation into the disappearance of Lynette Dawson, is a podcast written by Hedley Thomas and Slade Gibson that ran in 2018. It was credited with generating new leads that led to the subsequent arrest of Chris Dawson for the murder of his wife, and the setting up of police enquiry Strike Force Southwood to explore claims of sexual assaults and student-teacher relationships at several Sydney high schools brought up on the podcast. The series has had 28 million downloads, was the number-one Australian podcast and reached number one in the UK, Canada, and New Zealand. Both Hedley and Gibson received Gold Walkleys for their work on the series.

== Columnists and contributors ==
Former columnists include Mike Steketee, David Burchell, Michael Stutchbury, Emma Jane, George Megalogenis, Glenn Milne, Cordelia Fine, Alan Wood, Michael Costa, P. P. McGuinness, Michael Costello, Frank Devine, Matt Price, Christopher Pearson, Niki Savva. Political cartoonist Bill Leak worked for the paper until his death.

Stuart Rintoul (active from around 1989) was a senior writer with &quot;The Australian&quot;, with some expertise in Indigenous languages and history. His 2020 book &quot;Lowitja: The Authorised Biography of Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue&quot;, a biography of Indigenous Australian trailblazer Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue, was shortlisted for a Walkley Award for Best Non-Fiction Book, and was highly commended in the National Biography Awards in 2021.

Columnists include Janet Albrechtsen, Troy Bramston, Henry Ergas, Ticky Fullerton, Antonella Gambotto-Burke, Adam Creighton, Robert Gottliebsen, Gideon Haigh, Paul Kelly, Chris Kenny, Brendan O&#x27;Neill, Nicolas Rothwell, Angela Shanahan, Dennis Shanahan, Greg Sheridan, Judith Sloan, Cameron Stewart, Peter van Onselen, Graham Richardson, Peta Credlin, and Claire Lehmann. It also features daily cartoons from Johannes Leak and John Spooner.

Occasional contributors include Gregory Melleuish, Kevin Donnelly, Caroline Overington, Tom Switzer, James Allan, Hal G.P. Colebatch, Luke Slattery, Noel Pearson, Bettina Arndt, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott, and Lucian Boz.

Contributors to &quot;The Weekend Australian Magazine&quot; and &quot;Review&quot; in &quot;The Weekend Australian&quot; include Phillip Adams, national art critic Christopher Allen, actor and writer Graeme Blundell, Jeremy Clarkson, Antonella Gambotto-Burke, author Trent Dalton, author Nikki Gemmell, poet Sarah Holland-Batt, and demographer Bernard Salt. Film critic David Stratton retired in December 2023.

== Australian of the Year Award ==

In 1971, &quot;The Australian&quot; instituted its own &quot;Australian of the Year award&quot; separate and often different from the Australian of the Year chosen by the government&#x27;s National Australia Day Council. Starting in 1968, the official award had long had links to the Victorian Australia Day Council, and at the time a public perception arose that it was state-based. As a national newspaper, &quot;The Australian&quot; felt it was better situated to create an award that more truly represented all of Australia. Nominees are suggested by readers, decided upon by an editorial board, and awarded in January of every year.

==Circulation==

The first design concept was called &quot;21st Century Lifestyle&quot;, and the collection was showcased in New York during the Fashion Week Fall Winter 1997 Season, featuring men’s fashion and golf clothing.

To further develop the golf concept, Lindeberg turned to PGA-tour golfer Jesper Parnevik. 

===Critical acclaim===
In 1999, Swedish Elle presented J.Lindeberg with the &quot;Designer of the Year&quot; award. The following year (2000) J.Lindeberg received the &quot;Guldknappen&quot; (golden button) award as &quot;Most Innovative Designer&quot;. Later in 2000, J.Lindeberg opened its first flagship store in central Stockholm. Several more concept stores followed shortly in New York City, Tokyo, Yokohama and Los Angeles.

By 2002, J.Lindeberg&#x27;s annual turnover had reached 219 million Swedish kronor, selling in 500 stores worldwide. Lindeberg decided to feature his collections for the first time as a part of official New York Fashion Week Schedule in Bryant Park. J.Lindeberg has been worn on several official occasions by Bono from U2, Brad Pitt, Justin Timberlake, Ashton Kutcher, The Killers, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction, among others.

In mid-2002, Lindeberg and his wife Marcella, whom he met at Diesel, permanently relocated to London to set up a base for J.Lindeberg&#x27;s international marketing operations and a UK showroom with the purpose of expanding the brand. Shortly thereafter, the first women&#x27;s collection was revealed under the supervision of Marcella. Lindeberg also announced that J.Lindeberg would for the first time present a full denim concept for both men and women.

After appearing at the Milano Moda Uomo Fashion week, work began on reconstructing J.Lindeberg&#x27;s worldwide stores to also carry the women&#x27;s collection.

As work began on the women&#x27;s collection, Lindeberg revealed J.Lindeberg Future Sports. J.Lindeberg Future Sports also carried a completely new store concept and the first store opened in central Stockholm. The season after its initiation, the Future Sports Concept produced the first J.Lindeberg Ski Collection that was showcased together with the Fall/Winter 2005 season in Milan. The face of J.Lindeberg Ski became Swedish free skier Jon Olsson.

The J.Lindeberg Ski collection was exhibited at ISPO-fair in Germany where it won the &quot;Newcomer of the Year&quot; award. More concept collections appeared the following years, including, swimwear, sunglasses and shoes.

===Restructuring===
In 2007, the decreasing profitability of the company had begun to put heavy pressure on the relationship between Lindeberg and J.Lindeberg&#x27;s major shareholders. The issues were resolved when the capital investment firm Proventus became the new principal owner of J.Lindeberg with Stefan Engström, who also became the company’s new CEO. Before committing to J.Lindeberg, Engström had been one of the co-founders of Swedish sports apparel brand Peak Performance.

In the wake of the restructure, Lindeberg returned to the role of Creative Director and relocated with Marcella to New York.

The J.Lindeberg Ski Collection had been reintroduced, headed by Fredrik Dahl, who used to be the design director at &quot;The North Face&quot;. J.Lindeberg&#x27;s retail stores were remade by the French/Swedish architect Albert Francois Lenoard. The first of the new store concepts to open was the Flagship Store on in central Stockholm.

Pierangelo D&#x27;Agostin was reappointed as Design Director, with the responsibility of all concepts. He had been design director at Jil Sander and his own Japanese luxury brand hLam.

===Today===
Since 2012 J.Lindeberg has been owned by Anders Holch Povlsen (founder and owner of Bestseller), Dan Friis, Allan Warburg (also co-owners of Bestseller China) and Stefan Engström. The company has expanded globally and now also has a Chinese business. There are over 215 branded stores and shop in shops worldwide and yearly brand sales of approximately 1.6 BN SEK per year. In 2017, Stefan Engström decided to leave the role as CEO and was replaced by the company’s CFO, Johan Mark. Stefan Engström however, still continues to play an active role within the company.

J.Lindeberg continues to offer Fashion, Golf, Ski and Active Wear collections.

The design head office of all collections is situated in Stockholm, where the international design team sits. In January 2016, Johan Lindeberg came back to the company on a two-year assignment in the role of Creative Consultant.

<text>In United States history, scalawag (sometimes spelled scallawag or scallywag) was a pejorative slur referred to white Southerners who supported Reconstruction policies and efforts after the conclusion of the American Civil War.

As with the term &quot;carpetbagger&quot;, the word has a long history of use as a slur in Southern partisan debates. The post-Civil War opponents of the scalawags claimed they were disloyal to traditional values and white supremacy. Scalawags were particularly hated by 1860s–1870s Southern Democrats, who called Scalawags &quot;traitors to their region&quot;, which was long known for its widespread chattel slavery of Black people. Before the American Civil War, most Scalawags had opposed southern states&#x27; declared secession from the United States to form the Confederate States of America.

The term is commonly used in historical studies as a descriptor of Reconstruction Era, Southern white Republicans, although some historians have discarded the term due to its history of pejorative use.

==Origins of the term==

The term is a derogatory epithet, yet it is used by many historians in works by Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins (1991), James Alex Baggett (2003), Hyman Rubin (2006), and Frank J. Wetta (2012). The word &quot;scalawag&quot; has an uncertain origin. Its earliest attestation is from 1848 to mean a disreputable fellow. It has been speculated that &quot;perhaps the original use of the word&quot; referred to low-grade farm animals, but this meaning of the word was not attested until 1854. The term was later adopted by their opponents to refer to Southern whites who formed a Republican coalition with black freedmen and Northern newcomers (called carpetbaggers) to take control of their state and local governments. Among the earliest uses of this new meaning were references in Alabama and Georgia newspapers in the summer of 1867, first referring to all Southern Republicans, then later restricting it to only white ones.

Historian Ted Tunnel writes:

Reference works such as Joseph Emerson Worcester&#x27;s 1860 Dictionary of the Caribbean Spanish Language defined scalawag as &quot;A low worthless fellow; a scapegrace.&quot; Scalawag was also a word for low-grade farm animals. In early 1868 a Mississippi editor observed that scalawag &quot;has been used from time immemorial to designate inferior milch cows in the cattle markets of Virginia and Kentucky.&quot; That June the Richmond Enquirer concurred; scalawag had heretofore &quot;applied to all of the mean, lean, mangy, hidebound skiny [sic], worthless cattle in every particular drove.&quot; Only in recent months, the Richmond paper remarked, had the term taken on political meaning.
During the 1868–69 session of Judge &quot;Greasy&quot; Sam Watts&#x27; court in Haywood County, North Carolina, William Closs testified that a scalawag was &quot;a Native born Southern white man who says he is no better than a negro and tells the truth when he says it&quot;. Some accounts record his testimony as &quot;a native Southern white man, who says that a negro is as good as he is, and tells the truth when he says so&quot;.

By October 1868, a Mississippi newspaper defined the expression scathingly in terms of Redemption politics. The term continued to be used as a pejorative by conservative pro-segregationist southerners well into the 20th century. But historians commonly use the term to refer to the group of historical actors with no pejorative meaning intended.

==History==

After the American Civil War during the Reconstruction Era 1863 to 1869, Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson undertook policies designed to bring the Southern United States back to normal as soon as possible, while the Radical Republicans used Congress to block President Johnson&#x27;s policies, which favored ex-Confederates. The Radical Republicans imposed harsh terms and asserted new rights for the formerly enslaved, the Freedmen. In the Southern United States, Black Freedmen and White Southerners with Republican sympathies joined forces with Northerners who had moved south – called &quot;Carpetbaggers&quot; by their southern opponents – to implement the policies of the Republican party.

Despite being a minority, scalawags gained power by taking advantage of the Reconstruction laws of 1867, which disenfranchised the majority of Southern white voters as they could not take the Ironclad oath, which required they had never served in Confederate armed forces or held any political office under the state or Confederate governments. Historian Harold Hyman says that in 1866 Congressmen &quot;described the oath as the last bulwark against the return of ex-rebels to power, the barrier behind which Southern Unionists and Negroes protected themselves.&quot;

The coalition controlled every former Confederate state except Virginia, as well as Kentucky and Missouri – which were claimed by both the North and the South – for varying lengths of time between 1866 and 1877. Two of the most prominent scalawags were General James Longstreet, one of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s top generals, and Joseph E. Brown, who had been the wartime governor of Georgia. During the 1870s, many scalawags left the Republican Party and joined the conservative-Democrat coalition. Conservative Democrats had replaced all Republican minority governments in the Southern United States by 1877, after the disputed presidential election of 1876, in which the remaining Reconstruction governments had certified the Republican electors despite the Democratic candidate having carried the states.

Historian John Hope Franklin assesses the motives of Southern Unionists. He noted that as more Southerners were allowed to vote and participate:

A curious assortment of native Southerners thus became eligible to participate in Radical Reconstruction. And the number increased as the President granted individual pardons or issued new proclamations of amnesty ... Their primary interest was in supporting a party that would build the South on a broader base than the plantation aristocracy of Antebellum days. They found it expedient to do business with Negroes and so-called carpetbaggers, but often they returned to the Democratic party as it gained sufficient strength to be a factor in Southern politics.

Eventually, many scalawags joined the Democratic Redeemer coalition. A minority persisted as Republicans and formed the &quot;tan&quot; half of the &quot;Black and Tan&quot; Republican party. It was a minority element in the GOP in every Southern state after 1877.

Most of the 430 Republican newspapers in the Southern United States were edited by scalawags—only 20 percent were edited by carpetbaggers. White business owners generally boycotted Republican papers, which survived through government patronage.

===Alabama===
In Alabama, Wiggins says scalawags dominated the Republican Party. Some 117 Republicans were nominated, elected, or appointed to the most lucrative and powerful state executive positions, judgeships, and federal legislative and judicial offices between 1868 and 1881. They included 76 white Southerners, 35 Northerners, and 6 formerly enslaved people. In state offices during Reconstruction, white southerners were even more predominant: 51 won nominations, compared to 11 carpetbaggers and one black. Twenty-seven scalawags won state executive nominations (75%), 24 won state judicial nominations (89%), and 101 were elected to the Alabama General Assembly (39%). However, fewer scalawags won nominations to federal offices: 15 were nominated or elected to Congress (48%) compared to 11 carpetbaggers and 5 blacks. 48 scalawags were members of the 1867 constitutional convention (49.5% of the Republican membership); seven scalawags were members of the 1875 constitutional convention (58% of the minuscule Republican membership.)

In terms of racial issues, Wiggins says:

White Republicans as well as Democrats solicited black votes but reluctantly rewarded blacks with nominations for office only when necessary, even then reserving the more choice positions for whites. The results were predictable: these half-a-loaf gestures satisfied neither black nor white Republicans. The fatal weakness of the Republican party in Alabama, as elsewhere in the South, was its inability to create a biracial political party. And while in power even briefly, they failed to protect their members from Democratic terror. Alabama Republicans were forever on the defensive, verbally and physically.&quot;

===South Carolina===
In South Carolina, there were about 100,000 scalawags or about 15% of the white population. During its heyday, the Republican coalition attracted some wealthier white southerners, especially moderates favoring cooperation between open-minded Democrats and responsible Republicans. Rubin shows that the collapse of the Republican coalition came from disturbing trends of corruption and factionalism that increasingly characterized the party&#x27;s governance. These failings disappointed Northern allies who abandoned the state Republicans in 1876 as the Democrats under Wade Hampton reasserted control. They used the threat of violence to cause many Republicans to stay quiet or switch to the Democrats.

===Louisiana===
Wetta shows that New Orleans was a major Scalawag center. Their leaders were well-educated lawyers, physicians, teachers, ministers, business owners, and civil servants. Many had Northern ties or were born in the North, moving to the booming city of New Orleans before the 1850s. Few were cotton or sugar planters. Most had been Whigs before the war, but many had been Democrats. Nearly all were Unionists during the War. They had joined a Republican coalition with blacks but gave, at best, weak support to black suffrage, black office holding, or social equality. Wetta says that their &quot;cosmopolitanism broke the mold of southern provincialism&quot; typical of their southern-democratic opponents. That is, scalawags had &quot;a broader worldview.&quot;

===Mississippi===

The most prominent scalawag of all was James L. Alcorn of Mississippi. Alcorn was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865, but like all Southerners, he was not allowed to sit while the Republican Congress pondered Reconstruction. Alcorn supported suffrage for freedmen and endorsed the Fourteenth Amendment, as demanded by the Republicans in Congress. Alcorn became the leader of the scalawags, who composed about a third of the Republicans in the state, in coalition with carpetbaggers and freedmen. Elected governor by the Republicans in 1869, Alcorn served from 1870 to 1871. As a modernized, Alcorn appointed many like-minded former Whigs, even if they were Democrats. Alcorn strongly supported education, including public schools for blacks only, and a new college for them, now known as Alcorn State University. Alcorn maneuvered to make his ally Hiram Revels its president. Radical Republicans opposed Alcorn and were angry at his patronage policy. One complained that Alcorn&#x27;s policy was to see &quot;the old civilization of the South &quot;modernized&quot;&quot; rather than lead a total political, social and economic revolution.

Alcorn resigned the governorship to become a U.S. Senator (1871–1877), replacing his ally Hiram Revels, the first African American senator. Senator Alcorn urged the removal of the political disabilities of white southerners, rejected Radical Republican proposals to enforce social equality by federal legislation, denounced the federal cotton tax as robbery, and defended separate schools for both races in Mississippi. Although a former enslaver, Alcorn characterized slavery as &quot;cancer upon the body of the Nation&quot; and expressed the gratification that he and many other Southerners felt over its destruction.

Alcorn led a furious political battle with Senator Adelbert Ames, the carpetbagger who led the other faction of the Republican Party in Mississippi. The fight ripped apart the party, with most blacks supporting Ames and many—including Revels- supporting Alcorn. In 1873, they both sought a decision by running for governor. The Radicals and most African Americans supported Ames, while Alcorn won the votes of conservative whites and most of the scalawags. Ames won by a vote of 69,870 to 50,490, and Alcorn retired from state politics.

Newton Knight has gained increased attention since the 2016 release of the feature film &quot;Free State of Jones&quot;.

===Mountains===
The mountain districts of Appalachia were often Republican enclaves. People there enslaved few people, and they had poor transportation, deep poverty, and a standing resentment against the Low Country politicians who dominated the Confederacy and conservative Democrats in Reconstruction and after. Their strongholds in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, western Virginia, and North Carolina, and the Ozark region of northern Arkansas became Republican bastions. These rural folk had a long-standing hostility toward the planter class. They harbored pro-Union sentiments during the war. Andrew Johnson was their representative leader. They welcomed Reconstruction and much of what the Radical Republicans in Congress advocated.

===Outside the US===
The term &#x27;scally&#x27; is also used in the United Kingdom to refer to elements of the working class and petty criminality, in a similar vein to the more contemporary chav.
In the Philippines, the term &#x27;scalawag&#x27; is used to mean rogue police or military officers.

==Accusations of corruption==
Scalawags were denounced as corrupt by Redeemers. The Dunning School of historians sympathized with the claims of the Democrats. Agreeing with the Dunning School, Franklin said that the scalawags &quot;must take at least part of the blame&quot; for graft and corruption.

The Democrats alleged the scalawags to be financially and politically corrupt and willing to support bad government because they profited personally. One Alabama historian claimed: &quot;On economic matters scalawags and Democrats eagerly sought aid for economic development of projects in which they had an economic stake, and they exhibited few scruples in the methods used to push beneficial financial legislation through the Alabama legislature. The quality of the book keeping habits of both Republicans and Democrats was equally notorious.&quot; However, historian Eric Foner argues there is not sufficient evidence that scalawags were any more or less corrupt than politicians of any era, including Redeemers.

==Who were the scalawags?==

White Southern Republicans included formerly closeted Southern abolitionists as well as former enslavers who supported equal rights for freedmen. (The most famous of this latter group was Samuel F. Phillips, who later argued against segregation in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;.) Included, too, were people who wanted to be part of the ruling Republican Party simply because it provided more opportunities for successful political careers. Many historians have described scalawags in terms of social class, showing that, on average, they were less wealthy or prestigious than the elite planter class.

As Thomas Alexander (1961) showed, there was persistent Whiggery (support for the principles of the defunct Whig Party) in the Southern United States after 1865. Many ex-Whigs became Republicans who advocated modernization through education and infrastructure—significantly better roads and railroads. Many also joined the Redeemers in their successful attempt to replace the brief period of civil rights promised to African Americans during the Reconstruction era with the Jim Crow era of segregation and second-class citizenship that persisted into the 20th century.
Historian James Alex Baggett&#x27;s &quot;The Scalawags&quot; provides a quantitative study of the population.

<text>In Australian English, a billabong ( ) is a small body of water, usually permanent. It is usually an oxbow lake caused by a change in course of a river or creek, but other types of small lakes, ponds or waterholes are also called billabongs. The term is likely borrowed from Wiradjuri, an Aboriginal Australian language of New South Wales.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;billabong&quot; is most likely derived from the Wiradjuri language of southern New South Wales, which &quot;describes a pond or pool of water that is left behind when a river alters course or after floodwaters recede&quot;. According to the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; (2005), the original term &quot;bilabaŋ&quot; means &quot;a watercourse that runs only after rain&quot;, with &quot;bila&quot; meaning &quot;river&quot;, and possibly combined with &quot;bong&quot; or &quot;bung&quot;, meaning &quot;dead&quot;. The attribution of this last part of the word was contested in 2004 by Frederick Ludowyk of the Australian National Dictionary Centre, whose view was that that &quot;-bong&quot; or &quot;-bang&quot; was a suffix &quot;signifying a continuation in time or space&quot;. Ludowyk writes that &quot;bong&quot; meaning &quot;dead&quot; is not a Wiradjuri word, but may have been picked up or assumed from the word &quot;bung&quot;, which was originally a Yagara word used in the pidgin widely spoken across Australia.

The word is first recorded in Australian English in 1836, referring to the Bell River in south-eastern New South Wales, when explorer Thomas Mitchell records the Aboriginal name of the river as &quot;Billibang&quot;. It is first recorded in its later, more general sense, by J. Allen in 1853: &quot;This station is situated about half-a-mile inland, over a &#x27;billy-bong&#x27; (the native name for a small creek or backwater)&quot;. It is not recorded in the first edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (prepared 1882–1888), published before the later contributions of the Australian academic Edward Ellis Morris. It appears in Morris&#x27;s &quot;Austral English: A Dictionary of Australasian Words&quot; (1898).
A 2004 thesis suggests that the term could be of Scottish Gaelic origin, derived from words for &quot;lip&quot; or &quot;mouth&quot; and &quot;river&quot;.

==Definitions and descriptions==
Definitions vary. A billabong is often defined as an oxbow lake, an isolated crescentic pond left behind after a river loop is cut off when the river channel changes course.

Merriam-Webster defines the word as: &quot;1. (a) a blind channel leading out from a river; (b) a usually dry streambed that is filled seasonally&quot;, or 2. &quot;a backwater forming a stagnant pool&quot; The Cambridge Dictionary describes it as &quot;In Australia, a low area of ground that was part of a river in the past and that only fills up with water from the river during a flood&quot;.

In a 2009 study, billabongs of the Channel Country (a region of outback Australia whose name derives from the numerous intertwined rivulets that cross it) are alternatively termed waterholes, and described as &quot;enlarged channel segments along the main course of the river... typically occur[ring] at the confluence of two smaller channels&quot;.

Queensland&#x27;s Department of Environment, Science and Innovation, in its Queensland Waterhole Classification Scheme, describes waterholes as &quot;referred to by a range of different names (i.e. billabongs, lagoons and waterbodies)&quot;.

Another source describes a billabong as &quot;a large body of water&quot;, which may be formed from a section of cut-off river, but may also be formed from water left behind after a large flood.

Billabongs are usually formed when the path of a creek or river changes due to bank erosion, leaving the former channel deprived of further inflow and becoming a dead-end gully holding only residual water that has not yet drained or evaporated. As a result of the arid climate of many parts of Australia, these &quot;dead rivers&quot; often fill with water seasonally but can be dry for a greater part of the year.

== Significance==
===To people===
Many billabongs are of cultural significance and social importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and used as sources of fresh water as well as other resources. Water is an intrinsic part of Country, and essential resource during drought or dry seasons, and they have many intricate ways of understanding how to find water.

The Ngan&#x27;gi peoples in the Daly River region of the Northern Territory continue to manage the billabongs&#x27; ecology in their Country.

Water-holding frogs living in the billabongs can take up a lot of water before it burrows into the earth in the dry season, and Aboriginal peoples in desert environments can locate the frogs underground by various means.

In the days since the colonisation of Australia, these were important landmarks for European settlers to identify, and many billabongs were given names relating to the local areas.

A billabong retains water longer than the original watercourse and may be the only accessible water in a large area.

===Ecological significance===
Billabongs are significant because they do not have outflow and can hold water longer than sections of rivers especially during drier season, thus serving important ecological functions as waterholes and habitats for freshwater animal and plant species, including the water-holding frog. Many of these species&#x27; life cycles are related to the changes in seasons.

Dangers to the ecological balance of billabongs include saltwater intrusion and introduced species. Feral animals have caused salt water to flow into Arafura Swamp, a large freshwater basin in the Top End in the Northern Territory, in which there are many permanent billabongs.

==Examples==
*Arafura Swamp – many billabongs
* Along Cooper Creek in Queensland, and other parts of the Channel Country
*Corroboree Billabong, in Kakadu National Park
*Kings Billabong, on the Murray River in Victoria
*White Lily Billabong, in Kakadu National Park
*Yellow Water Billabong, in Kakadu National Park

== In the arts==
Banjo Paterson&#x27;s popular song &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; is set beside a billabong.
Mary Grant Bruce wrote a series of books, known as &quot;The Billabong Series&quot;, depicting the adventures of the Linton family, who live at Billabong station from around 1911 until the late 1920s.

Both Aboriginal Australians and European artists use billabongs as subject matter in painting. For example, Aboriginal painter Tjyllyungoo (Lance Chad) has a watercolour entitled &quot;Trees at a billabong&quot;.

American avant-garde filmmaker Will Hindle produced a short film titled &quot;Billabong&quot; in 1969.

They are mentioned in the title of the song &quot;Billabong Valley&quot; by Australian prog-rock band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.

== In commerce ==
Billabong is the name of an Australian brand of sportswear for surf, skateboard, and snowboard.

<text>Ted Healy (born Charles Ernest Lee Nash; October 1, 1896 – December 21, 1937) was an American vaudeville performer, comedian, and actor. Though he is chiefly remembered as the creator of The Three Stooges and the style of slapstick comedy that they later made famous, he had a successful stage and film career of his own and was cited as a formative influence by several later comedy stars.

== Early life ==
Sources conflict on Healy&#x27;s precise birth name (most sources indicate he was born Charles Ernest Lee Nash) but according to baptismal records, he was born Ernest Lea Nash on October 1, 1896, in Kaufman, Texas, to Charles McKinney Nash and Mary Eugenia (McGinty) Nash. He attended Holy Innocents School in Houston before the family, including his elder sister, Elizabeth Marcia Nash (March 7, 1895 – October 31, 1972), who later appeared in two 1930s films in small roles under the stage name Marcia Healy (&quot;The Sitter Downers&quot; and &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;), moved to New York in 1908. While in New York, he attended high school at De La Salle Institute. Nash initially intended to become a businessman but eventually decided on the stage.

==Show business career==

Nash made his first foray into show business in 1912 at the age of 15 when he and childhood friend Moe Howard joined the Annette Kellerman Diving Girls, a vaudeville act that included four boys. The act ended quickly after an accident on stage, and Nash and Howard went their separate ways. Nash then developed a vaudeville act and adopted the stage name Ted Healy. Healy&#x27;s act was a hit, and he soon expanded his role as a comedian and master of ceremonies. In the 1920s, he was the highest-paid performer in vaudeville, making $9,000 a week (equivalent to about $166,000 in 2024). He added performers to his stage show, including his new wife, Betty Brown (Betty Braun), and his German shepherd dog.

The Healys&#x27; revue toured, listed on the marquee as &quot;Syncopated Toes&quot;, and when some of his acrobats quit in late 1923, Moe Howard answered the advertisement for replacements. Since Howard was not an acrobat, Healy cast his old friend as a (a purported member of the audience who is picked, ostensibly at random, to come onstage). In the routine, Howard&#x27;s appearance would end with Healy losing his trousers.

Howard&#x27;s brother Shemp joined the act as a heckler in early 1924, but both Howards temporarily left show business in mid 1925. Ted and Betty were hired in June 1925 to star in the Broadway revue &quot;Earl Carroll Vanities of 1925.&quot; Ted brought some of the routines he developed with the Howard brothers, using three comics under contract to Carroll, (Dave Chasen, Kenneth Lackey, and Lou Warren). After a contract dispute whereby it was determined that Carroll was in the wrong, Ted and Betty left &quot;Vanities&quot; in October 1925 with Lou Warren and relaunched their &quot;Syncopated Toes&quot; revue, now retitled &quot;Fun in the Healy Manner&quot;. By January 1926 Shemp Howard had returned, and they successfully toured the country through the summer of 1926. Ted and Betty received another Broadway opportunity, this time from the Shubert Brothers, who hired them for &quot;The Passing Show of 1926&quot;, with Ted bringing Shemp and Lou along. &quot;Passing&quot; only enjoyed a preview tour and did not open on Broadway, but the Shuberts and Healy retooled the show into the successful &quot;A Night in Spain&quot;, with Phil Baker joining the Healys as its stars. For &quot;Spain&quot;, Ted utilized four stooges in some scenes: Shemp, Lou Warren, brother-in-law Sam &quot;Moody&quot; Braun, and Dick Hakins. Arriving on Broadway in May 1927 after four months of successful previews, Hakins fell ill and was replaced by comedy/specialty dancer Bobby Pinkus. In November 1927, &quot;Spain&quot; began a national tour with four months at Chicago&#x27;s Four Cohans Theatre. Larry Fine, who had been working as the lead performer and house MC at Chicago&#x27;s Rainbo Gardens nightclub and restaurant, was added to Healy&#x27;s group of comics in late March 1928.
The Shuberts hired Ted to star in their new show &quot;A Night in Venice&quot;. Moe Howard returned to show business and joining Ted at his home in Connecticut to develop some comedy bits for the revue, which began rehearsals in January 1929. Shemp Howard also returned, but Larry Fine was in Atlantic City with his wife, waiting for the birth of his daughter. Healy hired comedy xylophonist Fred Sanborn in Fine&#x27;s place. Circa mid February, Fine joined the &quot;Venice&quot; cast.

During the run of &quot;A Night in Spain&quot;, Ted and Betty performed a song-and-dance stage act in nightclubs and other theaters after the evening show; but the Healys split in 1928. Ted came up with the idea to spotlight his stooges in a new act, with the emphasis on comedy and slapstick humor. Concurrent with their performances in &quot;Venice&quot;, Healy booked his troupe in additional shows as &#x27;&quot;Ted Healy &amp; His Southern Gentlemen&quot; and later as &quot;Ted Healy &amp; His Racketeers&quot;. &quot;A Night in Venice&quot; had a brief road tour after Broadway and closed in March 1930.

Fox Films hired Healy to costar in the film &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot; (filmed in July 1930), and Ted brought Moe, Shemp, Larry, and Fred Sanborn with him. In late August 1930, the Stooges and Healy parted ways after a dispute over a movie contract. Sanborn began a solo career, and the remaining trio began performing on their own, using such monikers as &quot;The Three Lost Soles&quot; and &quot;Howard, Fine, and Howard,&quot; and often incorporated material from previous Healy shows. Healy attempted to sue the Stooges for using his material, but the copyright was held by the Shubert Theatre Corporation, for which the routines had been produced, and the Stooges had the Shuberts&#x27; permission to use it.

Healy hired replacement stooges—Eddie Moran (soon replaced by Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Hakins), Jack Wolf (father of sportscaster Warner Wolf), and Paul &quot;Mousie&quot; Garner—in early 1931. This group appeared with Healy in two Broadway plays, &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; and &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Crazy Quilt&quot;.

Moe, Larry, and Shemp rejoined Healy&#x27;s act in late July 1932, but Shemp left on August 19 to pursue a solo career and was replaced by his younger brother, Curly Howard. The switch from Shemp to Curly happened very quickly, and on August 27, 1932, only eight days after Shemp departed, &quot;Ted Healy with Howard, Fine &amp; Howard&quot; premiered Curly at the RKO Palace in Cleveland, Ohio. The new lineup&#x27;s personal appearances headlined many of the prime nightclubs and movie palaces nationally for the next several months. In late spring 1933, Ted was contracted by MGM, and the act once more headed to Hollywood, this time to stay. Over the next year, Ted&#x27;s comedy team appeared in several MGM shorts and even supported stars like Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in theatrical films like &quot;Dancing Lady&quot;, a blockbuster which featured Healy in an important supporting role as well as Fred Astaire. On his own, Healy was given major roles in MGM features such as &quot;Bombshell&quot; with Jean Harlow and &quot;Operator 13&quot; with Marion Davies and Gary Cooper. In March 1934, Fine and the Howards permanently and more or less amicably parted professional ways with Ted Healy and began working at Columbia Studios as &quot;The Three Stooges.&quot;

=== After the Stooges ===
Healy appeared in a succession of films for MGM from 1934 to 1937 and was also loaned to 20th Century-Fox and Warner Bros. for films by those companies, playing both dramatic and comedic roles. One of his films, &quot;Mad Holiday&quot; (1936), featured stooge Dick Hakins as his sidekick. In &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936), a new lineup of &quot;stooges&quot; consisting of Jimmy Brewster, Red Pearson, and Sammy Glasser (Sammy Wolfe) filmed a scene with Healy, but it was omitted from the final release; a few production stills of them survive. Also, in the Technicolor short subject &quot;La Fiesta de Santa Barbara (1935)&quot;, Jimmy Brewster briefly appears to &#x27;stooge&#x27; with Healy. During this period, Healy took to wearing a toupée in public. His last film, &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot; (1937), was released a few days after he died.

==Personal life==

Healy&#x27;s first wife was dancer and singer Betty Brown (born Elizabeth Braun), whom he married in 1922, one week after they met. The couple worked together in vaudeville, then divorced in 1932 after Brown sued socialite Mary Brown Warburton (the granddaughter of business tycoon John Wanamaker) for &quot;alienation of her husband&#x27;s affections&quot;.

Healy&#x27;s second marriage was to UCLA student Betty Hickman. After introducing himself, Healy proposed immediately, and the couple became engaged the following day. They were married in Yuma, Arizona, on May 15, 1936, after a midnight elopement by plane. Hickman was granted a divorce on October 7, 1936, which was nullified after a reconciliation. Their son, John Jacob, was born on December 17, 1937, four days before Healy&#x27;s death.

Healy campaigned for the reelection of President Herbert Hoover in 1932.

== Death ==

Healy died on December 21, 1937, at the age of 41, after an evening of celebration at the Trocadero nightclub on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. He was reportedly celebrating the birth of his son, an event he had eagerly anticipated, according to Moe Howard. &quot;He was nuts about kids&quot;, wrote Howard. &quot;He used to visit our homes and envied the fact that we were all married and had children. Healy always loved kids and often gave Christmas parties for underprivileged youngsters and spent hundreds of dollars on toys.&quot;

The circumstances surrounding his death remain a matter of some controversy. An MGM spokesman initially announced the cause as a heart attack, but the presence of recent wounds—a cut over his right eye and a &quot;discolored&quot; left eye—combined with reports of an altercation at the Trocadero gave rise to speculation that he died as a result of those injuries.

Healy&#x27;s friend, writer Henry Taylor, told Moe Howard that the fight was preceded by an argument between Healy and three men whom he identified as &quot;college fellows&quot;. The younger men allegedly knocked Healy to the ground and kicked him in the head, ribs, and abdomen. The wrestler Man Mountain Dean reported that he was standing in front of the Plaza Hotel in Hollywood at 2:30 a.m. when Healy emerged, bleeding, from a taxi. He related an &quot;incoherent story&quot; of being attacked at the Trocadero but could not identify his assailant. Dean contacted a physician, Sydney Weinberg, who treated Healy at the hotel. Another friend, Joe Frisco, then drove him to his home. Wyantt LaMont, Healy&#x27;s personal physician, was summoned to the home the following morning when Healy began experiencing convulsions. Despite the efforts of LaMont and a cardiologist, John Ruddock, Healy died later that day. Because of the circumstances, LaMont refused to sign Healy&#x27;s death certificate.

A later source alleged that the three assailants were not college boys but rather actor Wallace Beery, Albert R. Broccoli, and Broccoli&#x27;s cousin, agent/producer Pat DiCicco. While there is no documentation in contemporaneous news reports that either Beery or DiCicco was present, Broccoli admitted that he was indeed involved in a fist fight with Healy at the Trocadero. He later modified his story, stating that a heavily intoxicated Healy had picked a fight with him and the two had briefly scuffled and then shook hands and parted ways. In other reports, Broccoli admitted to pushing Healy, but not striking him.

Following an autopsy, the Los Angeles County coroner reported that Healy died of acute toxic nephritis secondary to acute and chronic alcoholism. Police closed their investigation, as there was no indication in the report that his death was caused by physical assault.

Healy was a prodigious spender; despite a weekly salary of $1,700 (), he died in debt. He indulged in numerous personal luxuries and paid his assistant performers&#x27; salaries out of his own pocket. He was also financially generous to friends when they were out of work; for example, while unemployed, Frisco lived at an expensive hotel on Healy&#x27;s tab. Betty was left responsible for a multitude of liabilities, including hospital bills related to the birth of her son and Healy&#x27;s medical care. She remained hospitalized for some time after Healy died, leaving their house unattended; as a result, it was burglarized and looted of everything of value.

A trust fund was organized by friends and colleagues to provide financial support for Betty and her child. A fundraiser was also held, including a $10-per-plate dinner () and an auction of the Hollywood Hotel&#x27;s ledger with hundreds of famous signatures, but Betty later asserted that she never received any proceeds from the fundraiser.

Ted Healy is interred at Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles, California, along with his mother and sister.

==Legacy==
In the decades that followed, many comedy stars, including Milton Berle, Bob Hope, and Red Skelton, cited Healy as a mentor and significant influence on their careers. &quot;Back in 1925, Ted Healy took me aside and gave me some wonderful advice,&quot; Berle told Walter Winchell, in 1955. &quot;&#x27;Milton, always play to the public. Never mind playing to the theatrical crowd. Don&#x27;t try to impress the trumpet player in the pit. Entertain the people and you&#x27;ll get rich and famous.&#x27;&quot; Alex Gard&#x27;s caricature of Healy was the first of several hundred displayed at Sardi&#x27;s restaurant in New York City&#x27;s Theater District.

<doc id="396964" wikidata="Q2014587" url="?curid=396964" title="Purkinje fibers">
<text>The Purkinje fibers, named for Jan Evangelista Purkyně, ( ; ; Purkinje tissue or subendocardial branches) are located in the inner ventricular walls of the heart, just beneath the endocardium in a space called the subendocardium. The Purkinje fibers are specialized conducting fibers composed of electrically excitable cells. They are larger than cardiomyocytes with fewer myofibrils and many mitochondria. They conduct cardiac action potentials more quickly and efficiently than any of the other cells in the heart&#x27;s electrical conduction system. Purkinje fibers allow the heart&#x27;s conduction system to create synchronized contractions of its ventricles, and are essential for maintaining healthy and consistent heart rhythm.

==Histology==
Purkinje fibers are a unique cardiac end-organ. Further histologic examination reveals that these fibers are split in ventricles walls. The electrical origin of atrial Purkinje fibers arrives from the sinoatrial node.

Given no aberrant channels, the Purkinje fibers are distinctly shielded from each other by collagen or the cardiac skeleton.

The Purkinje fibers are further specialized to rapidly conduct impulses (having numerous fast voltage-gated sodium channels and mitochondria, and fewer myofibrils, than the surrounding muscle tissue). Purkinje fibers take up stain differently from the surrounding muscle cells because of having relatively fewer myofibrils than other cardiac cells. The presence of glycogen around the nucleus causes Purkinje fibers to appear, on a slide, lighter and larger than their neighbors, being arranged along the longitudinal direction (parallel to the cardiac vector). They are often binucleated cells.

==Function==
Heart rate is governed by many influences from the autonomic nervous system. The Purkinje fibers do not have any known role in setting heart rate unless the SA node is compromised (when they can act as pacemaker cells). They are influenced by electrical discharge from the sinoatrial node.

=== Impulse carrying ===
During the ventricular contraction portion of the cardiac cycle, the Purkinje fibers carry the contraction impulse from both the left and right bundle branch to the myocardium of the ventricles. This causes the muscle tissue of the ventricles to contract. This generates force to eject blood out of the heart, either to the pulmonary circulation from the right ventricle, or to the systemic circulation from the left ventricle.

=== Replacement pacemaker ===
Purkinje fibers also have the ability of firing at a rate of 20–40 beats per minute if upstream conduction or pacemaking ability is compromised. In contrast, the SA node in normal state can fire at 60-100 beats per minute. In short, they generate action potentials, but at a slower rate than the sinoatrial node. This capability is normally suppressed. Thus, they serve as the last resort when other pacemakers fail. When a Purkinje fiber does fire, it is called a premature ventricular contraction or PVC, or in other situations can be a ventricular escape.

==Etymology==
Purkinje fibers are named after the Czech scientist Jan Evangelista Purkyně, who discovered them in 1839.

<text>Motion capture (sometimes referred as mo-cap or mocap, for short) is the process of recording the movement of objects or people. It is used in military, entertainment, sports, medical applications, and for validation of computer vision and robots. In films, television shows and video games, motion capture refers to recording actions of human actors and using that information to animate digital character models in 2D or 3D computer animation. When it includes face and fingers or captures subtle expressions, it is often referred to as performance capture. In many fields, motion capture is sometimes called motion tracking, but in filmmaking and games, motion tracking usually refers more to match moving.

In motion capture sessions, movements of one or more actors are sampled many times per second. Whereas early techniques used images from multiple cameras to calculate 3D positions, often the purpose of motion capture is to record only the movements of the actor, not their visual appearance. This &quot;animation data&quot; is mapped to a 3D model so that the model performs the same actions as the actor. This process may be contrasted with the older technique of rotoscoping.

Camera movements can also be motion captured so that a virtual camera in the scene will pan, tilt or dolly around the stage driven by a camera operator while the actor is performing. At the same time, the motion capture system can capture the camera and props as well as the actor&#x27;s performance. This allows the computer-generated characters, images and sets to have the same perspective as the video images from the camera. A computer processes the data and displays the movements of the actor, providing the desired camera positions in terms of objects in the set. Retroactively obtaining camera movement data from the captured footage is known as &quot;match moving&quot; or &quot;camera tracking&quot;.

The first virtual actor animated by motion-capture was produced in 1993 by Didier Pourcel and his team at Gribouille. It involved &quot;cloning&quot; the body and face of French comedian Richard Bohringer, and then animating it with still-nascent motion-capture tools.

==Advantages==

Motion capture offers several advantages over traditional computer animation of a 3D model:
* Low latency, close to real-time results can be obtained. In entertainment applications, this can reduce the costs of keyframe-based animation. The Hand Over technique is an example of this.
* The amount of work does not vary with the complexity or length of the performance to the same degree as when using traditional techniques. This allows many tests to be done with different styles or deliveries, giving a distinct personality that is only limited by the talent of the actor.
* Complex movement and realistic physical interactions such as secondary motions, weight, and exchange of forces can be easily recreated in a physically accurate manner.
* The amount of animation data that can be produced within a given time is extremely large when compared to traditional animation techniques. This contributes to both cost-effectiveness and meeting production deadlines.
* Potential for free software and third-party solutions reducing its costs.

==Disadvantages==

* Specific hardware and special software programs are required to obtain and process the data.
* The cost of the software, equipment and personnel required can be prohibitive for small productions.
* The capture system may have specific requirements for the space in which it is operated, depending on camera field of view or magnetic distortion.
* When problems occur, it is easier to shoot the scene again rather than trying to manipulate the data. Only a few systems allow real-time viewing of the data to decide if the take needs to be redone.
* The initial results are limited to what can be performed within the capture volume without extra editing of the data.
* Movement that does not follow the laws of physics cannot be captured.
* Traditional animation techniques, such as added emphasis on anticipation and follow through, secondary motion or manipulating the shape of the character, as with squash and stretch animation techniques, must be added later.
* If the computer model has different proportions from the capture subject, artifacts may occur. For example, if a cartoon character has large, oversized hands, these may intersect the character&#x27;s body if the human performer is not careful with their physical motion.

==Applications==

There are many applications of Motion Capture. The most common are for video games, movies, and movement capture, however there is a research application for this technology being used at Purdue University in robotics development.

=== Video games ===
Video games often use motion capture to animate athletes, martial artists, and other in-game characters. As early as 1988, an early form of motion capture was used to animate the 2D player characters of Martech&#x27;s video game &quot;Vixen&quot; (performed by model Corinne Russell) and Magical Company&#x27;s 2D arcade fighting game &quot;Last Apostle Puppet Show&quot; (to animate digitized sprites). Motion capture was later notably used to animate the 3D character models in the Sega Model arcade games &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; (1993) and &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; (1994). In mid-1995, developer/publisher Acclaim Entertainment had its own in-house motion capture studio built into its headquarters. Namco&#x27;s 1995 arcade game &quot;Soul Edge&quot; used passive optical system markers for motion capture. Motion capture also uses athletes in based-off animated games, such as Naughty Dog&#x27;s Crash Bandicoot, Insomniac Games&#x27; Spyro the Dragon, and Rare&#x27;s Dinosaur Planet.

=== Robotics ===
Indoor positioning is another application for optical motion capture systems. Robotics researchers often use motion capture systems when developing and evaluating control, estimation, and perception algorithms and hardware. In outdoor spaces, it&#x27;s possible to achieve accuracy to the centimeter by using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) together with Real-Time Kinematics (RTK). However, this reduces significantly when there is no line-of-sight to the satellites — such as in indoor environments. The majority of vendors selling commercial optical motion capture systems provide accessible open source drivers that integrate with the popular Robotic Operating System (ROS) framework, allowing researchers and developers to effectively test their robots during development.

In the field of aerial robotics research, motion capture systems are widely used for positioning as well. Regulations on airspace usage limit how feasible outdoor experiments can be conducted with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Indoor tests can circumvent such restrictions. Many labs and institutions around the world have built indoor motion capture volumes for this purpose.

Purdue University houses the world&#x27;s largest indoor motion capture system, inside the Purdue UAS Research and Test (PURT) facility. PURT is dedicated to UAS research, and provides tracking volume of 600,000 cubic feet using 60 motion capture cameras. The optical motion capture system is able to track targets in its volume with millimeter accuracy, effectively providing the true position of targets — the &quot;ground truth&quot; baseline in research and development. Results derived from other sensors and algorithms can then be compared to the ground truth data to evaluate their performance.

=== Movies ===
Movies use motion capture for CGI effects, in some cases replacing traditional cel animation, and for completely CGI creatures, such as Gollum, The Mummy, King Kong, Davy Jones from &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, the Na&#x27;vi from the film &quot;Avatar&quot;, and Clu from &quot;&quot;. The Great Goblin, the three Stone-trolls, many of the orcs and goblins in the 2012 film &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, and Smaug were created using motion capture.

The film &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995) used some motion capture for certain visual effects. Warner Bros. had acquired motion capture technology from arcade video game company Acclaim Entertainment for use in the film&#x27;s production. Acclaim&#x27;s 1995 video game of the same name also used the same motion capture technology to animate the digitized sprite graphics.

&quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) was the first feature-length film to include a main character created using motion capture (that character being Jar Jar Binks, played by Ahmed Best), and Indian-American film &quot;&quot; (2000) was the first feature-length film made primarily with motion capture, although many character animators also worked on the film, which had a very limited release. 2001&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; was the first widely released movie to be made with motion capture technology. Despite its poor box-office intake, supporters of motion capture technology took notice. &quot;Total Recall&quot; had already used the technique, in the scene of the x-ray scanner and the skeletons.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; was the first feature film to utilize a real-time motion capture system. This method streamed the actions of actor Andy Serkis into the computer-generated imagery skin of Gollum / Smeagol as it was being performed.

Storymind Entertainment, which is an independent Ukrainian studio, created a neo-noir third-person / shooter video game called &quot;My Eyes On You,&quot; using motion capture in order to animate its main character, Jordan Adalien, and along with non-playable characters.

Out of the three nominees for the 2006 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, two of the nominees (&quot;Monster House&quot; and the winner &quot;Happy Feet&quot;) used motion capture, and only Disney·Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; was animated without motion capture. In the ending credits of Pixar&#x27;s film &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, a stamp appears labelling the film as &quot;100% Genuine Animation – No Motion Capture!&quot;

Since 2001, motion capture has been used extensively to simulate or approximate the look of live-action theater, with nearly photorealistic digital character models. &quot;The Polar Express&quot; used motion capture to allow Tom Hanks to perform as several distinct digital characters (in which he also provided the voices). The 2007 adaptation of the saga &quot;Beowulf&quot; animated digital characters whose appearances were based in part on the actors who provided their motions and voices. James Cameron&#x27;s highly popular &quot;Avatar&quot; used this technique to create the Na&#x27;vi that inhabit Pandora. The Walt Disney Company has produced Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; using this technique. In 2007, Disney acquired Zemeckis&#x27; ImageMovers Digital (that produces motion capture films), but then closed it in 2011, after a box office failure of &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot;.

Television series produced entirely with motion capture animation include &quot;Laflaque&quot; in Canada, &quot;Sprookjesboom&quot; and &quot;&quot; in The Netherlands, and &quot;Headcases&quot; in the UK.

=== Movement capture ===
Virtual reality and Augmented reality providers, such as uSens and Gestigon, allow users to interact with digital content in real time by capturing hand motions. This can be useful for training simulations, visual perception tests, or performing virtual walk-throughs in a 3D environment. Motion capture technology is frequently used in digital puppetry systems to drive computer-generated characters in real time.

Gait analysis is one application of motion capture in clinical medicine. Techniques allow clinicians to evaluate human motion across several biomechanical factors, often while streaming this information live into analytical software.

One innovative use is pose detection, which can empower patients during post-surgical recovery or rehabilitation after injuries. This approach enables continuous monitoring, real-time guidance, and individually tailored programs to enhance patient outcomes.

Some physical therapy clinics utilize motion capture as an objective way to quantify patient progress.

During the filming of James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; all of the scenes involving motion capture were directed in real-time using Autodesk MotionBuilder software to render a screen image which allowed the director and the actor to see what they would look like in the movie, making it easier to direct the movie as it would be seen by the viewer. This method allowed views and angles not possible from a pre-rendered animation. Cameron was so proud of his results that he invited Steven Spielberg and George Lucas on set to view the system in action.

In Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot;, Mark Ruffalo used motion capture so he could play his character the Hulk, rather than have him be only CGI as in previous films, making Ruffalo the first actor to play both the human and the Hulk versions of Bruce Banner.

FaceRig software uses facial recognition technology from ULSee.Inc to map a player&#x27;s facial expressions and the body tracking technology from Perception Neuron to map the body movement onto a 2D or 3D character&#x27;s motion on-screen.

During &quot;Game Developers Conference&quot; 2016 in San Francisco &quot;Epic Games&quot; demonstrated full-body motion capture live in Unreal Engine. The whole scene, from the upcoming game &quot;&quot; about a woman warrior named Senua, was rendered in real-time. The keynote was a collaboration between &quot;Unreal Engine&quot;, &quot;Ninja Theory&quot;, &quot;3Lateral&quot;, &quot;Cubic Motion&quot;, &quot;IKinema&quot; and &quot;Xsens&quot;.

In 2020, the two-time Olympic figure skating champion Yuzuru Hanyu graduated from Waseda University. In his thesis, using data provided by 31 sensors placed on his body, he analysed his jumps. He evaluated the use of technology both in order to improve the scoring system and to help skaters improve their jumping technique. In March 2021 a summary of the thesis was published in the academic journal.

==Methods and systems==

Motion tracking or motion capture started as a photogrammetric analysis tool in biomechanics research in the 1970s and 1980s, and expanded into education, training, sports and recently computer animation for television, cinema, and video games as the technology matured. Since the 20th century, the performer has to wear markers near each joint to identify the motion by the positions or angles between the markers. Acoustic, inertial, LED, magnetic or reflective markers, or combinations of any of these, are tracked, optimally at least two times the frequency rate of the desired motion. The resolution of the system is important in both the spatial resolution and temporal resolution as motion blur causes almost the same problems as low resolution. Since the beginning of the 21st century - and because of the rapid growth of technology - new methods have been developed. Most modern systems can extract the silhouette of the performer from the background. Afterwards all joint angles are calculated by fitting in a mathematical model into the silhouette. For movements you can not see a change of the silhouette, there are hybrid systems available that can do both (marker and silhouette), but with less marker. In robotics, some motion capture systems are based on simultaneous localization and mapping.
==Optical systems==
&quot;Optical systems&quot; utilize data captured from image sensors to triangulate the 3D position of a subject between two or more cameras calibrated to provide overlapping projections. Data acquisition is traditionally implemented using special markers attached to an actor; however, more recent systems are able to generate accurate data by tracking surface features identified dynamically for each particular subject. Tracking a large number of performers or expanding the capture area is accomplished by the addition of more cameras. These systems produce data with three degrees of freedom for each marker, and rotational information must be inferred from the relative orientation of three or more markers; for instance shoulder, elbow and wrist markers providing the angle of the elbow. Newer hybrid systems are combining inertial sensors with optical sensors to reduce occlusion, increase the number of users and improve the ability to track without having to manually clean up data.

===Passive markers===
&quot;Passive optical&quot; systems use markers coated with a retroreflective material to reflect light that is generated near the camera&#x27;s lens. The camera&#x27;s threshold can be adjusted so only the bright reflective markers will be sampled, ignoring skin and fabric.

The centroid of the marker is estimated as a position within the two-dimensional image that is captured. The grayscale value of each pixel can be used to provide sub-pixel accuracy by finding the centroid of the Gaussian.

An object with markers attached at known positions is used to calibrate the cameras and obtain their positions, and the lens distortion of each camera is measured. If two calibrated cameras see a marker, a three-dimensional fix can be obtained. Typically a system will consist of around 2 to 48 cameras. Systems of over three hundred cameras exist to try to reduce marker swap. Extra cameras are required for full coverage around the capture subject and multiple subjects.

Vendors have constraint software to reduce the problem of marker swapping since all passive markers appear identical. Unlike active marker systems and magnetic systems, passive systems do not require the user to wear wires or electronic equipment. Instead, hundreds of rubber balls are attached with reflective tape, which needs to be replaced periodically. The markers are usually attached directly to the skin (as in biomechanics), or they are velcroed to a performer wearing a full-body spandex/lycra suit designed specifically for motion capture. This type of system can capture large numbers of markers at frame rates usually around 120 to 160 fps although by lowering the resolution and tracking a smaller region of interest they can track as high as 10,000 fps.

===Active marker===

Active optical systems triangulate positions by illuminating one LED at a time very quickly or multiple LEDs with software to identify them by their relative positions, somewhat akin to celestial navigation. Rather than reflecting light back that is generated externally, the markers themselves are powered to emit their own light. Since the inverse square law provides one quarter of the power at two times the distance, this can increase the distances and volume for capture. This also enables a high signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in very low marker jitter and a resulting high measurement resolution (often down to 0.1 mm within the calibrated volume).

The TV series &quot;Stargate SG1&quot; produced episodes using an active optical system for the VFX allowing the actor to walk around props that would make motion capture difficult for other non-active optical systems.

ILM used active markers in &quot;Van Helsing&quot; to allow capture of Dracula&#x27;s flying brides on very large sets similar to Weta&#x27;s use of active markers in &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot;. The power to each marker can be provided sequentially in phase with the capture system providing a unique identification of each marker for a given capture frame at a cost to the resultant frame rate. The ability to identify each marker in this manner is useful in real-time applications. The alternative method of identifying markers is to do it algorithmically requiring extra processing of the data.

There are also possibilities to find the position by using colored LED markers. In these systems, each color is assigned to a specific point of the body.

One of the earliest active marker systems in the 1980s was a hybrid passive-active mocap system with rotating mirrors and colored glass reflective markers and which used masked linear array detectors.

===Time modulated active marker===

Active marker systems can further be refined by strobing one marker on at a time, or tracking multiple markers over time and modulating the amplitude or pulse width to provide marker ID. 12-megapixel spatial resolution modulated systems show more subtle movements than 4-megapixel optical systems by having both higher spatial and temporal resolution. Directors can see the actor&#x27;s performance in real-time, and watch the results on the motion capture-driven CG character. The unique marker IDs reduce the turnaround, by eliminating marker swapping and providing much cleaner data than other technologies. LEDs with onboard processing and radio synchronization allow motion capture outdoors in direct sunlight while capturing at 120 to 960 frames per second due to a high-speed electronic shutter. Computer processing of modulated IDs allows less hand cleanup or filtered results for lower operational costs. This higher accuracy and resolution requires more processing than passive technologies, but the additional processing is done at the camera to improve resolution via subpixel or centroid processing, providing both high resolution and high speed. These motion capture systems typically cost $20,000 for an eight-camera, 12-megapixel spatial resolution 120-hertz system with one actor.

===Semi-passive imperceptible marker===
One can reverse the traditional approach based on high-speed cameras. Systems such as Prakash use inexpensive multi-LED high-speed projectors. The specially built multi-LED IR projectors optically encode the space. Instead of retro-reflective or active light emitting diode (LED) markers, the system uses photosensitive marker tags to decode the optical signals. By attaching tags with photo sensors to scene points, the tags can compute not only their own locations of each point, but also their own orientation, incident illumination, and reflectance.

These tracking tags work in natural lighting conditions and can be imperceptibly embedded in attire or other objects. The system supports an unlimited number of tags in a scene, with each tag uniquely identified to eliminate marker reacquisition issues. Since the system eliminates a high-speed camera and the corresponding high-speed image stream, it requires significantly lower data bandwidth. The tags also provide incident illumination data which can be used to match scene lighting when inserting synthetic elements. The technique appears ideal for on-set motion capture or real-time broadcasting of virtual sets but has yet to be proven.

===Underwater motion capture system===
Motion capture technology has been available for researchers and scientists for a few decades, which has given new insight into many fields.

====Underwater cameras====
The vital part of the system, the underwater camera, has a waterproof housing. The housing has a finish that withstands corrosion and chlorine which makes it perfect for use in basins and swimming pools. There are two types of cameras. Industrial high-speed cameras can also be used as infrared cameras. Infrared underwater cameras come with a cyan light strobe instead of the typical IR light for minimum fall-off underwater and high-speed cameras with an LED light or with the option of using image processing. 
=====Measurement volume=====
An underwater camera is typically able to measure 15–20 meters depending on the water quality, the camera and the type of marker used. Unsurprisingly, the best range is achieved when the water is clear, and like always, the measurement volume is also dependent on the number of cameras. A range of underwater markers are available for different circumstances.

=====Tailored=====
Different pools require different mountings and fixtures. Therefore, all underwater motion capture systems are uniquely tailored to suit each specific pool instalment. For cameras placed in the center of the pool, specially designed tripods, using suction cups, are provided.

===Markerless===
Emerging techniques and research in computer vision are leading to the rapid development of the markerless approach to motion capture. Markerless systems such as those developed at Stanford University, the University of Maryland, MIT, and the Max Planck Institute, do not require subjects to wear special equipment for tracking. Special computer algorithms are designed to allow the system to analyze multiple streams of optical input and identify human forms, breaking them down into constituent parts for tracking. ESC entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers Pictures created especially to enable virtual cinematography, including photorealistic digital look-alikes for filming &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; movies, used a technique called Universal Capture that utilized 7 camera setup and the tracking the optical flow of all pixels over all the 2-D planes of the cameras for motion, gesture and facial expression capture leading to photorealistic results.

====Traditional systems====
Traditionally markerless optical motion tracking is used to keep track of various objects, including airplanes, launch vehicles, missiles and satellites. Many such optical motion tracking applications occur outdoors, requiring differing lens and camera configurations. High-resolution images of the target being tracked can thereby provide more information than just motion data. The image obtained from NASA&#x27;s long-range tracking system on the space shuttle Challenger&#x27;s fatal launch provided crucial evidence about the cause of the accident. Optical tracking systems are also used to identify known spacecraft and space debris despite the fact that it has a disadvantage compared to radar in that the objects must be reflecting or emitting sufficient light.

An optical tracking system typically consists of three subsystems: the optical imaging system, the mechanical tracking platform and the tracking computer.

The optical imaging system is responsible for converting the light from the target area into a digital image that the tracking computer can process. Depending on the design of the optical tracking system, the optical imaging system can vary from as simple as a standard digital camera to as specialized as an astronomical telescope on the top of a mountain. The specification of the optical imaging system determines the upper limit of the effective range of the tracking system.

The mechanical tracking platform holds the optical imaging system and is responsible for manipulating the optical imaging system in such a way that it always points to the target being tracked. The dynamics of the mechanical tracking platform combined with the optical imaging system determines the tracking system&#x27;s ability to keep the lock on a target that changes speed rapidly.

The tracking computer is responsible for capturing the images from the optical imaging system, analyzing the image to extract the target position and controlling the mechanical tracking platform to follow the target. There are several challenges. First, the tracking computer has to be able to capture the image at a relatively high frame rate. This posts a requirement on the bandwidth of the image-capturing hardware. The second challenge is that the image processing software has to be able to extract the target image from its background and calculate its position. Several textbook image-processing algorithms are designed for this task. This problem can be simplified if the tracking system can expect certain characteristics that is common in all the targets it will track. The next problem down the line is controlling the tracking platform to follow the target. This is a typical control system design problem rather than a challenge, which involves modeling the system dynamics and designing controllers to control it. This will however become a challenge if the tracking platform the system has to work with is not designed for real-time.

The software that runs such systems is also customized for the corresponding hardware components. One example of such software is OpticTracker, which controls computerized telescopes to track moving objects at great distances, such as planes and satellites. Another option is the software SimiShape, which can also be used hybrid in combination with markers.

====RGB-D cameras====
RGB-D cameras such as Kinect capture both the color and depth images. By fusing the two images, 3D colored voxels can be captured, allowing motion capture of 3D human motion and human surface in real-time.

Because of the use of a single-view camera, motions captured are usually noisy. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to automatically reconstruct such noisy motions into higher quality ones, using methods such as lazy learning and Gaussian models. Such method generates accurate enough motion for serious applications like ergonomic assessment.

==Non-optical systems==

===Inertial systems===
Inertial motion capture technology is based on miniature inertial sensors, biomechanical models and sensor fusion algorithms. The motion data of the inertial sensors (inertial guidance system) is often transmitted wirelessly to a computer, where the motion is recorded or viewed. Most inertial systems use inertial measurement units (IMUs) containing a combination of gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer, to measure rotational rates. These rotations are translated to a skeleton in the software. Much like optical markers, the more IMU sensors the more natural the data. No external cameras, emitters or markers are needed for relative motions, although they are required to give the absolute position of the user if desired. Inertial motion capture systems capture the full six degrees of freedom body motion of a human in real-time and can give limited direction information if they include a magnetic bearing sensor, although these are much lower resolution and susceptible to electromagnetic noise. Benefits of using Inertial systems include: capturing in a variety of environments including tight spaces, no solving, portability, and large capture areas. Disadvantages include lower positional accuracy and positional drift which can compound over time. These systems are similar to the Wii controllers but are more sensitive and have greater resolution and update rates. They can accurately measure the direction to the ground to within a degree. The popularity of inertial systems is rising amongst game developers, mainly because of the quick and easy setup resulting in a fast pipeline. A range of suits are now available from various manufacturers and base prices range from $1000 to US$80,000.

===Mechanical motion===
Mechanical motion capture systems directly track body joint angles and are often referred to as exoskeleton motion capture systems, due to the way the sensors are attached to the body. A performer attaches the skeletal-like structure to their body and as they move so do the articulated mechanical parts, measuring the performer&#x27;s relative motion. Mechanical motion capture systems are real-time, relatively low-cost, free from occlusion, and wireless (untethered) systems that have unlimited capture volume. Typically, they are rigid structures of jointed, straight metal or plastic rods linked together with potentiometers that articulate at the joints of the body. These suits tend to be in the $25,000 to $75,000 range plus an external absolute positioning system. Some suits provide limited force feedback or haptic input.

===Magnetic systems===
Magnetic systems calculate position and orientation by the relative magnetic flux of three orthogonal coils on both the transmitter and each receiver. The relative intensity of the voltage or current of the three coils allows these systems to calculate both range and orientation by meticulously mapping the tracking volume. The sensor output is 6DOF, which provides useful results obtained with two-thirds the number of markers required in optical systems; one on upper arm and one on lower arm for elbow position and angle. The markers are not occluded by nonmetallic objects but are susceptible to magnetic and electrical interference from metal objects in the environment, like rebar (steel reinforcing bars in concrete) or wiring, which affect the magnetic field, and electrical sources such as monitors, lights, cables and computers. The sensor response is nonlinear, especially toward edges of the capture area. The wiring from the sensors tends to preclude extreme performance movements. With magnetic systems, it is possible to monitor the results of a motion capture session in real time. The capture volumes for magnetic systems are dramatically smaller than they are for optical systems. With the magnetic systems, there is a distinction between alternating-current (AC) and direct-current (DC) systems: DC system uses square pulses, AC systems uses sine wave pulse.

=== Stretch sensors ===
Stretch sensors are flexible parallel plate capacitors that measure either stretch, bend, shear, or pressure and are typically produced from silicone. When the sensor stretches or squeezes its capacitance value changes. This data can be transmitted via Bluetooth or direct input and used to detect minute changes in body motion. Stretch sensors are unaffected by magnetic interference and are free from occlusion. The stretchable nature of the sensors also means they do not suffer from positional drift, which is common with inertial systems. Stretchable sensors, on the other hands, due to the material properties of their substrates and conducting materials, suffer from relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, requiring filtering or machine learning to make them usable for motion capture. These solutions result in higher latency when compared to alternative sensors.

==Related techniques==

===Facial motion capture===
Most traditional motion capture hardware vendors provide for some type of low-resolution facial capture utilizing anywhere from 32 to 300 markers with either an active or passive marker system. All of these solutions are limited by the time it takes to apply the markers, calibrate the positions and process the data. Ultimately the technology also limits their resolution and raw output quality levels.

High-fidelity facial motion capture, also known as performance capture, is the next generation of fidelity and is utilized to record the more complex movements in a human face in order to capture higher degrees of emotion. Facial capture is currently arranging itself in several distinct camps, including traditional motion capture data, blend-shaped based solutions, capturing the actual topology of an actor&#x27;s face, and proprietary systems.

The two main techniques are stationary systems with an array of cameras capturing the facial expressions from multiple angles and using software such as the stereo mesh solver from OpenCV to create a 3D surface mesh, or to use light arrays as well to calculate the surface normals from the variance in brightness as the light source, camera position or both are changed. These techniques tend to be only limited in feature resolution by the camera resolution, apparent object size and number of cameras. If the users face is 50 percent of the working area of the camera and a camera has megapixel resolution, then sub millimeter facial motions can be detected by comparing frames. Recent work is focusing on increasing the frame rates and doing optical flow to allow the motions to be retargeted to other computer generated faces, rather than just making a 3D Mesh of the actor and their expressions.

===Radio frequency positioning===
Radio frequency positioning systems are becoming more viable as higher frequency radio frequency devices allow greater precision than older technologies such as radar. The speed of light is 30 centimeters per nanosecond (billionth of a second), so a 10 gigahertz (billion cycles per second) radio frequency signal enables an accuracy of about 3 centimeters. By measuring amplitude to a quarter wavelength, it is possible to improve the resolution down to about 8 mm. To achieve the resolution of optical systems, frequencies of 50 gigahertz or higher are needed, which are almost as dependent on line of sight and as easy to block as optical systems. Multipath and reradiation of the signal are likely to cause additional problems, but these technologies will be ideal for tracking larger volumes with reasonable accuracy, since the required resolution at 100 meter distances is not likely to be as high. Many scientists believe that radio frequency will never produce the accuracy required for motion capture.

Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers said in 2015 that they had made a system that tracks motion by radio frequency signals.

===Non-traditional systems===
An alternative approach was developed where the actor is given an unlimited walking area through the use of a rotating sphere, similar to a hamster ball, which contains internal sensors recording the angular movements, removing the need for external cameras and other equipment. Even though this technology could potentially lead to much lower costs for motion capture, the basic sphere is only capable of recording a single continuous direction. Additional sensors worn on the person would be needed to record anything more.

Another alternative is using a 6DOF (Degrees of freedom) motion platform with an integrated omni-directional treadmill with high resolution optical motion capture to achieve the same effect. The captured person can walk in an unlimited area, negotiating different uneven terrains. Applications include medical rehabilitation for balance training, bio-mechanical research and virtual reality.

===3D pose estimation===
In 3D pose estimation, an actor&#x27;s pose can be reconstructed from an image or depth map.

<text>Pedro José Domingo de la Calzada Manuel María Lascuráin Paredes (8 May 1856 – 21 July 1952) was a Mexican politician who served as the 38th president of Mexico for 45 minutes on 19 February 1913, the shortest presidency in history. The grandson of Mariano Paredes, the 15th president of Mexico, Lascuráin previously served as Mexico&#x27;s foreign secretary for two terms and was the director of a small law school in Mexico City for 16 years.

==Early life==
Pedro José Domingo de la Calzada Manuel María Lascuráin Paredes was born on 8 May 1856 in the Rancho la Romita (now Colonia Roma) in Mexico City. He was the son of Francisco Lascuráin é Icaza and Ángela (Ana) Paredes Cortés. Francisco Lascuráin was a wealthy merchant originally from Veracruz who had moved to Mexico City and married Paredes, who family was of Basque origin, established in Mexico in the early 19th century. Pedro Lascuráin Paredes was the fourth of his parents&#x27; seven children. His elder siblings were Francisco, María de los Angeles, and José, while his younger siblings were María de los Dolores, María, and Ignacio. Francisco, José, and Ignacio all died in infancy.

Lascuráin&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga, who served as the 15th president of Mexico from 1845 to 1846. His paternal grandparents were Pedro Lascuráin and Dolores de Icaza y Jiménez del Arenal.

Lascuráin was raised in a Catholic family, and was reportedly very religious himself. In 1890, Lascuráin married María Enriqueta Flores y Manzanera (born 1873), the daughter of Juan Manuel Flores, a governor of Durango during the Porfiriato. They had six children: Pedro, Ana, Fernando, Francisco, Enrique, and José de Jesús. Pedro Lascuráin y Flores died as an infant.

==Early career==
In his youth, he attended the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. Lascuráin then studied at the Escuela Nacional de Jurisprudencia (National School of Jurisprudence) in Mexico City. He received a law degree there in 1880. He became a prominent lawyer and legal theorist, while also serving as a prestigious businessman in real estate.

He was mayor of Mexico City in 1910 when Francisco I. Madero began a campaign against the re-election of Porfirio Díaz. Lascuráin was a supporter of Madero, and after Madero was elected president to replace Díaz, Lascuráin served twice as foreign secretary in Madero&#x27;s cabinet, from 10 April 1912 to 4 December 1912, and from 15 January 1913 to 19 February 1913. In between the two terms, he again was the mayor of Mexico City. As foreign secretary, he had to deal with the demands of Henry Lane Wilson, the United States ambassador to Mexico.

==Presidency==
On 9 February 1913, a coup d&#x27;état to overthrow Madero, known as the Ten Tragic Days (), began. By the 18th, the pro-Madero general Victoriano Huerta switched sides and joined the coup, capturing Madero and part of his cabinet. The president and vice president signed their resignations the following day. Lascuráin was one of the people who convinced Madero to resign the presidency while he was being held prisoner in the National Palace and claimed that his life was in danger if he refused.

Under the 1857 Constitution of Mexico, the vice president, the attorney general, the foreign secretary, and the interior secretary stood in line to the presidency. As well as Madero, Huerta had ousted vice president José María Pino Suárez and attorney general Adolfo Valles Baca. To give the coup d&#x27;état some appearance of legality, he had Lascuráin assume the presidency, who would then appoint him as his interior secretary, making Huerta next in line to the presidency, and then resign.

The presidency thus passed to Huerta. As a consequence, Lascuráin was president for less than an hour; sources quote figures ranging from 15 to 56 minutes, making his presidency the shortest in history.

Huerta called a late-night special session of Congress, and under the guns of his troops, the legislators endorsed his assumption of power. A few days later, Huerta had Madero and Pino Suárez killed. The coup and the events surrounding it became known as the Ten Tragic Days.

==Later life==
Huerta offered Lascuráin a post in his cabinet, but Lascuráin declined. He retired from politics and began practicing again as a lawyer. He was the director of the Escuela Libre de Derecho, a conservative law school, for 16 years and published extensively on commercial and civil law. Lascuráin died on 21 July 1952 at his home in Mexico City. His wife had died over a year earlier, on 20 June 1951. The couple are buried in the Panteón Francés in Mexico City.

<text>Carl Ferdinand Howard Henry (January 22, 1913 – December 7, 2003) was an American evangelical Christian theologian who provided intellectual and institutional leadership to the neo-evangelical movement in the mid-to-late 20th century. He was ordained in 1942 after graduating from Northern Baptist Theological Seminary and went on to teach and lecture at various schools and publish and edit many works surrounding the neo-evangelical movement. His early book, &quot;The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism&quot; (1947), was influential in calling evangelicals to differentiate themselves from separatist fundamentalism and claim a role in influencing the wider American culture. He was involved in the creation of numerous major evangelical organizations that contributed to his influence in Neo-evangelicalism and lasting legacy, including the National Association of Evangelicals, Fuller Theological Seminary, Evangelical Theological Society, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; magazine (of which he was the founding editor), and the Institute for Advanced Christian Studies. The Carl F. H. Henry Institute for Evangelical Engagement at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and the Carl F. H. Henry Center for Theological Understanding at Trinity International University seek to carry on his legacy. His ideas about Neo-evangelism are still debated to this day and his legacy continues to inspire change in American social and political culture.

==Early life==
Henry grew up in Long Island, New York as the son of German immigrants, Karl F. Heinrich and Johanna Vaethroeder (Väthröder). After his high school graduation in 1929 he began working in newspaper journalism.

In 1932, at the age of 19, he became editor of &quot;The Smithtown Times&quot; and later a stringer for The New York Times. The next year, after becoming a Christian, he decided to go to college to begin a life of Christian service. 

==Family==
His wife Helga Bender Henry wrote a book in 1955 about the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles. In 1999 she published &quot;Cameroon on a Clear Day&quot; about her parents&#x27; work in that country.

Their son Paul B. Henry was a U.S. Congressman from Michigan from 1985 until his death in 1993.

==Education==
Frank E. Gaebelein, then headmaster of The Stony Brook School, gave him a catalogue to the evangelical liberal arts Wheaton College. He enrolled in 1935, where he was greatly influenced by the philosophical teaching of Gordon Clark. While at Wheaton, Henry also taught typing and journalism. There he met Helga, a missionary kid, whom he married in August 1940. He received both bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from Wheaton. He then earned a Doctor of Theology degree from Northern Baptist Theological Seminary. Henry was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1942. He also earned a PhD from Boston University in 1949.

==Teaching career==
Henry taught at Northern Baptist Theological Seminary from 1942 to 1947. Also in 1942, Henry took part in launching the National Association of Evangelicals, serving on its board for several years and being book editor of their magazine &quot;United Evangelical Action&quot;.

In 1947, Henry joined with Harold Ockenga, Harold Lindsell, Edward John Carnell, and radio evangelist Charles E. Fuller to help establish Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He served as acting dean in the seminary&#x27;s first year and remained there as a professor until he left to establish &quot;Christianity Today&quot; magazine.

In 1949, Henry was part of the meeting of evangelical scholars who discussed the need for an organization &quot;to promote serious academic discussion,&quot; and suggested the name adopted by the resulting organization: the Evangelical Theological Society.

Henry taught as a visiting professor or guest lecturer at colleges, universities, seminaries, and conferences across the United States and around the world, including in Japan, Singapore, India, Liberia, South Korea, Yugoslavia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and Romania. These institutions include the Asian Center for Theological Studies and Mission, Bethel University (Minnesota), Christian Theological Seminary, Columbia Bible College, Denver Conservative Baptist Seminary, Gordon Divinity School (which is now known as Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary), Hillsdale College, Hong Kong Baptist College (which is now called Hong Kong Baptist University), Latin American Theological Seminary, Soongsil University, Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary (now renamed as Palmer Theological Seminary), The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and Winona Lake Summer School of Theology. He also served as the chairman for international conferences and consultations, including the World Congress on Evangelism in Berlin in 1966.

In the early 1980s Henry was a founding board member of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, with which he remained active until the mid-1990s.

==Writing and editing career==
His first book was . His second book, , is a critique that rejects modern liberalism and preserves a doctrinal focus on the Bible, but also rejects the rigidness and disengagement of Fundamentalists. The book firmly established Henry as one of the leading Evangelical scholars.

In 1956, Henry became the first editor-in-chief of the magazine &quot;Christianity Today,&quot; which was founded by evangelist Billy Graham to serve as a scholarly voice for evangelical Christianity and a challenge to the liberal &quot;Christian Century&quot;. He was the magazine&#x27;s editor until 1968.

Henry&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; was a six-volume work entitled &quot;God, Revelation, and Authority,&quot; completed in 1983. He concluded &quot;that if we humans say anything authentic about God, we can do so only on the basis of divine self-revelation; all other God-talk is conjectural.&quot; In his &quot;magnum opus&quot; he presented a version of Christian apologetics called presuppositional apologetics. Henry regarded all truth as propositional, and Christian doctrine as &quot;the theorems derived from the axioms of revelation.&quot;

==Influence on neo-evangelicalism==
Henry was one of the most influential figures in the development of Neo-Evangelicalism, which emerged in the 1940s and 1950s as a response to the fundamentalist-modernist controversies of the early 20th century. Henry sought to create a new movement that would combine orthodox Christian theology with broader cultural engagement rather than just within Christianity. David F. Wells says Henry&#x27;s belief in the authority of scripture and the importance of God as the foundation of Christianity helped to recover a more biblically grounded theology in contrast to the theological liberalism of the early 20th century. Henry&#x27;s influence would likely not have had as far of a reach if not for his founding of the evangelical magazine Christianity Today and his work in establishing Fuller Theological Seminary and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. Neo-evangelism in years after Henry&#x27;s influence has started to become more about conservatism and culture wars, however the legacy of Henry has inspired some neo-evangelists in recent years to promote a shift in emphasis to social justice and a broader assessment of cultural and political issues beyond the concerns of only conservatism.

==Death==
Henry died in 2003 at the age of 90.

==Critical assessments==
As with any theologian, Henry had people who criticized his work and beliefs. One such critic is Stanley Hauerwas, a theologian who believes similarly to Henry that society ought to be formed around Christian ethics but disagreed with the way Henry wants to go about it. Hauerwas writes &quot;Carl Henry, for example, has developed a highly sophisticated model of cultural influence, which assumes that if Christians can only become successful in the worlds of scholarship, journalism, and the arts, then they will be able to reassert the Christian vision in a society that has largely forgotten it. But Henry&#x27;s vision, no matter how sophisticated, is ultimately one of assimilation, and in the end, that is no more than capitulation to the dominant culture.&quot; Hauerwas goes on to argue that the church&#x27;s main goal is not to change the world, but to be a faithful witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ. He argues that the church&#x27;s role is to promote a way of life that is characterized by love, hospitality, and forgiveness, rather than by power and success.

Another critic of Henry is David F. Wells, who did agree with some of Henry&#x27;s theology but also disagreed with Henry&#x27;s idea of cultural engagement, arguing that Henry&#x27;s focus on defending Christian truth has not been effective with our current culture. He says that Henry&#x27;s approach is too narrow and does not address the broader cultural and social issues facing our society.

George M. Marsden critiques Henry&#x27;s book &quot;The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism (1947)&quot;, saying it was a good critique of fundamentalism and helped to create a new focus for evangelicalism that emphasized broader cultural engagement. However, Marsden also argues that Henry&#x27;s critique was limited by his own theological and cultural biases. He says Henry is blinded by his social and cultural context as an outsider to fundamentalism and therefore puts a greater influence on cultural engagement than other evangelicals might.

<text>The Knights of Pythias is a fraternal organization and secret society founded in Washington, D.C., on . The Knights of Pythias is the first fraternal organization to receive a charter under an act of the United States Congress.

== History ==
The Knights of Pythias is a fraternal organization and secret society founded in Washington, D.C., on . The Knights of Pythias is the first fraternal organization to receive a charter under an act of the United States Congress.The order was founded by Justus H. Rathbone, who had been inspired by a play by the Irish poet John Banim about the historic Greek legend of Damon and Pythias that illustrates the Pythagorean ideals of loyalty, honor, and friendship that are the center of the order. 

Membership in the organization was originally restricted to whites only. African Americans formed their own organization, the Knights of Pythias of North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.

In 2003, the order had over 2,000 lodges in the United States and around the world, with a total membership of over 50,000. Some lodges meet in structures referred to as Pythian Castles.

== Symbols ==
The initials F.C.B. are often inscribed on the order&#x27;s swords, lapel pins, and crest. The initials stand for &quot;Friendship, Charity, Benevolence,&quot; which is the motto of the Knights of Pythias. Its logo features the letters FCB, from its motto, with the colors blue, yellow, and red on an inverted triangle.

=== Sword ===
Early in the group&#x27;s history, when a man was inducted into the Knights of Pythias, he received a ceremonial sword. Such a sword might be given to a Pythian by family members, business associates, or others as a token of esteem.

Markings on swords varied widely. Most swords were inscribed with the initials &quot;FCB&quot;, which stand for the Pythian motto. Images on swords were also somewhat common, and included: 

* a man, woman, and child (symbolic of Damon saying good-bye to his family)
* a man looking out of a building, with a group of people below (symbolic of Pythias&#x27; pending execution)
* a man (Samson) between some pillars, pulling them down, or various types of weapons (swords, axes, hammers, etc.).

A full Knight of the Pythian order often inscribed his sword with the image of a knight&#x27;s helmet with a lion on the crest. Many also carried the image of a sprig of myrtle (the Pythian symbol of love) or a falcon (the Pythian symbol of vigilance).

Swords owned by a member of the Uniformed Rank might be inscribed with the initials &quot;UR,&quot; a dove, or a lily.
== Organization ==
The structure of the Knights of Pythias is three-tiered. The local units are called &quot;Subordinate Lodges.&quot; State and provincial organizations are called &quot;Grand Lodges&quot; and the national structure is called the &quot;Supreme Lodge&quot; and meets in convention biennially. The officers of the Supreme Lodge include the sitting Past Supreme Chancellor, Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, Prelate, Secretary, Treasurer, Master at Arms, Inner Guard and Outer Guard.

The order&#x27;s auxiliaries are the Pythian Sisters, the Dramatic Order of the Knights of Khorassan, and the Nomads of Avrudaka.

=== Rank structure ===
The ranks of Pythian Knighthood in a subordinate lodge (or &quot;Castle&quot;) are:
#Page
#Esquire
#Knight

In 1877, the order adopted an optional rank, called the Endowment Rank, which provided fraternal insurance benefits. In 1930, this department split from the Knights of Pythias and became a mutual life insurance company, later known as the &quot;American United Insurance Company&quot;.

Finally, members who obtained the rank of Knight were eligible to join the later-defunct Uniform Rank, which participated in parades and other processions.

== Membership ==
Membership has historically been open to males in good health who believe in a Supreme Being. Maimed individuals were not admitted until 1875. Members are accepted by blackball ballot.

A member must be at least 18 years of age, and must take the following oath:

By the end of the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Fraternalism&quot; in the early 1920s, the order had nearly a million members. By 1979, however, this number had declined to fewer than 200,000.

== Philanthropy ==
The order provides for &quot;worthy Pythians in distress&quot; and has given aid to victims of national or sectional disasters. It runs camps for underprivileged youth and homes for aged members. It has sponsored scholarship funds, blood drives, highway safety programs, and the Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation.

== Other Pythian organizations ==
=== Knights of Pythias of North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa ===
After a black lodge was denied a charter by the Knights of Pythias&#x27; Supreme Lodge meeting in Richmond, Virginia on , a number of black Americans who had been initiated into the order formed their own Pythian group, the Knights of Pythias of North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. By 1897, the KPNSAEAA had 40,000 members, with Grand Lodges in 20 states and other lodges in the West Indies and Central America. It distributed worth of benefits annually and had a woman&#x27;s auxiliary and uniformed rank.

=== Canada ===
The Grand Lodge of Ontario was instituted on . Rowena L. Rooks composed &quot;K of P grand march [for piano],&quot; which was dedicated to Collin H. Rose, Grand Chancellor, and the officers and representatives of the Grand Lodge K of P of Ontario, Canada. The march sheet music, which was published in London, Ontario, by C. F. Colwell, 1876, was illustrated with the Knights of Pythias emblem and Latin motto or, in English, &quot;True friends are a refuge&quot;.

=== Improved Order, Knights of Pythias ===
In 1892, the Supreme Lodge ruled that the work of the order would only be conducted in English. This upset some members who were accustomed to using German. After this ruling was reiterated at the Supreme Lodges of 1894 and 1895, a number of German-speaking Pythians split off and formed the Improved Order, Knights of Pythias at a convention in Indianapolis in June 1895. The new order was reportedly not very popular, and a movement toward reconciliation occurred a few years later.

A self-styled warrior, Lady Deathstrike hired the villain Spiral&#x27;s &quot;body shoppe&quot; to bond adamantium to her skeleton in addition to other cyber-genetic enhancements. She has worked as a mercenary and assassin and feels a need to prove herself by killing Wolverine. Lady Deathstrike is the sister of human crime boss Lord Deathstrike (Kazuo Oyama). She, along with former X-Men members Mystique, Sabretooth, Domino, Warpath, and Old Man Logan formed a team called Weapon X-Men, but later changed to Weapon X-Force after Logan and Warpath left with Omega Red.

A mutant version of Lady Deathstrike, played by Kelly Hu and without any of Deathstrike&#x27;s backstory, appeared as a brainwashed henchman of William Stryker in the 2003 film &quot;X2&quot;. A variant appears as a henchman of Cassandra Nova in the 2024 film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Publication history==
She first appeared as Yuriko Oyama in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #197 (August 1983) and later as Lady Deathstrike in &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; #33 (April 1986).

She was created by writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist William Johnson (&quot;Daredevil&quot; #197). Writer Bill Mantlo and artist Sal Buscema designed her samurai appearance (&quot;Alpha Flight&quot; #33). Writer Chris Claremont added defining characteristics such as her cyborg abilities, while Barry Windsor-Smith designed her cyborg appearance (&quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #205, May 1986).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life in Japan===
Yuriko Oyama (大山 ゆりこ &quot;Oyama Yuriko&quot;) was born in Osaka, Japan. Her father was Lord Dark Wind (Kenji Oyama), a Japanese crime lord and criminal scientist who created the process by which adamantium can be bonded to bone. Kenji was a former Japanese kamikaze pilot during World War II. His face was horribly scarred in a failed suicide attack on an American battleship. Feeling ashamed by his failure decades earlier, he scarred the faces of Yuriko and her two brothers in a ritual design. Her two brothers later died while in their father&#x27;s service.

Yuriko teamed up with Daredevil to free her lover, Kira, from her father&#x27;s servitude, and to take vengeance on her father for her scarring and the death of her two brothers. She guided Daredevil to Lord Dark Wind&#x27;s private island in search of Bullseye. However, when Yuriko slew Lord Dark Wind, the devoted Kira chose suicide to honor his master.

===Wolverine, X-Men, and Alpha Flight===
Distraught, Yuriko belatedly embraced her father&#x27;s ideals and sought to track down whoever dishonored him and restore Japan&#x27;s honor. She adopted a costumed identity, as a samurai warrior. She attempted to find Bullseye with an adamantium tracking device, intending to get revenge on him for betraying her father and retrieve the adamantium in his bones for study. Instead, the device led to Wolverine, whose skeleton had also been bonded with adamantium. Deathstrike sought to kill him to right the wrong of the theft of her father&#x27;s theories and to restore her family&#x27;s honor; however, she and her followers were defeated by Wolverine and Vindicator of Alpha Flight. She went to the Mojoverse and sought Spiral&#x27;s &quot;body shoppe&quot; where she received extensive cybernetic enhancements including adamantium bones and talons. As a cyborg, she became a professional criminal, and joined forces with former Hellfire Club mercenaries-turned-cyborgs Cole, Macon, and Reese. The four cyborgs stalked Wolverine and Katie Power in New York.

Lady Deathstrike – along with Cole, Macon, and Reese – joined the team of criminal cyborgs called the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce. Together, the Reavers captured and crucified Wolverine. Lady Deathstrike was accidentally teleported along with Wolverine and Puck to 1937 in Spain. There, she joined forces with a Luftwaffe unit, and battled Wolverine. Her right arm was destroyed by a tank, and when she returned to the present she was given a new right arm. The Reavers gang was broken up by Trevor Fitzroy&#x27;s Sentinels and most of them were destroyed, though Deathstrike herself survived. She later battled Wolverine and Sabretooth in Times Square.

At times she has resigned her quest to kill Logan and has worked cooperatively with the X-Men toward a common goal, such as the defeat of Stryfe. In an encounter with Logan shortly after Magneto removed the adamantium from his skeleton, Lady Deathstrike again encountered Puck and Vindicator. The fight with Wolverine destroyed much of Vindicator&#x27;s house and ended when Wolverine revealed his bone claws. As Logan no longer possessed the adamantium stolen from her father, she concluded there was no honor to be gained by killing him. She leaves the premises peacefully. However, she still remains a mercenary and an assassin.

When Captain America appears in Japan after a year spent in another dimension, he manages to find Lady Deathstrike working with terrorists. Their goals were to drive American influence out of Japan, by any means possible, including mass murder. Captain America defeats her before any innocent lives are lost.

Lady Deathstrike resurfaced as an ally of William Stryker. She displays a new ability to access the Internet via her cybernetics but this led to her being co-opted and controlled by Mount Haven&#x27;s computer systems.

Lady Deathstrike was responsible for mutilating and nearly killing Sunfire, whose legs she severed in battle.

===Civil War===
Following her confrontation with Rogue and Sunfire, Lady Deathstrike resurfaced as a member of one of the United States government&#x27;s Army of Thunderbolts in the super hero Civil War, temporarily released from prison in order to go after the Secret Avengers, who resisted the Superhuman Registration Act. She fights alongside other criminals such as Venom, Jester, Bullseye, Jack O&#x27;Lantern, Taskmaster, and Songbird. She participates in the final battle of the Civil War in Times Square, New York City, before being sent to the Negative Zone Prison.

===Messiah Complex===
Lady Deathstrike returns during the Messiah Complex story to play an important role in the series, facing off against X-23. This was confirmed by IGN Comics, who, in their editorial analysis &quot;13 Days of Messiah Complex,&quot; revealed that Deathstrike would be leading a new team of Reavers throughout the event. As reported, Lady Deathstrike appears alongside the Reavers, now made up of nameless Purifiers with armor and weapons instead of any former members. Having allied with the Purifiers to destroy mutant-kind, Lady Deathstrike leads the new Reaver team against the New X-Men, gravely wounding Hellion in the process. Her armor was destroyed by X-23 and Rockslide. She appears again in pursuit of Cable and the mutant newborn where she battled X-Force and X-23 again and X-23 nearly kills her.

===Sisterhood of Mutants===
Lady Deathstrike is apparently saved from death due to the actions of Spiral, as she is later seen under repair in Spiral&#x27;s Body Shoppe when Madelyne Pryor approaches Spiral with an invitation of membership in her Sisterhood of Mutants. Despite not originally being approached to join the Sisterhood, Lady Deathstrike accepts Pryor&#x27;s offer nonetheless. It appears that while Spiral repaired Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s body, she gave her a more submissive personality, as during missions with the Sisterhood, she continually does whatever she is told, while referring to Spiral as &quot;Mistress&quot;. After the Sisterhood resurrects Psylocke, they make their move on the X-Men, with Lady Deathstrike being tasked to take down Wolverine, by piercing his lungs. Lady Deathstrike kept Wolverine busy while the Sisterhood raided his room for one of his most treasured possessions: a lock of Jean Grey&#x27;s hair.

===Rejoining with the Reavers===
Lady Deathstrike reappeared with the Reavers. Still driven for revenge against Wolverine, Lady Deathstrike worked with the Reavers to suicide-bomb Utopia. However, when X-Force intervened, Lady Deathstrike escaped her body via Internet.

During the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline, Lady Deathstrike was seen in one of Doctor Octopus&#x27;s facilities in Australia. When Kangaroo II enters this facility, Lady Deathstrike ambushes and kills him in one swift swipe from her claw.

Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers are later seen in the Core, an underground city populated by robots. She battles with Captain Britain after the Secret Avengers arrive in the city in search of Ant-Man.

Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s consciousness was later uploaded in the body of Ana Cortes, establishing a symbiotic relationship with Ana&#x27;s consciousness. Cortes was a teenage Latin female that has returned to Bogota, Colombia from boarding school after the death of her father to inherit her deceased father&#x27;s kingdom. She then traveled to the Jean Grey Academy alongside her friend Reiko to find Karima Shapandar and retrieve the Omega Sentinel technology. Deathstrike and her team see her jogging with Monet, and attempt to ambush them. During the confrontation, Karmina is shot, and Monet manages to protect her temporarily, until Monet gets caught off guard. Before Deathstrike could finish her attack, Karmina shoots, and injures Lady Deathstrike causing her to retreat to regroup and get more intel. She then learns of Arkea, and has hired Typhoid Mary to help her achieve this goal. Deathstrike and Typhoid Mary argue with John Sublime about Arkea and they manage to get information out of him that there was more than one piece of Arkea that was alive, as the one they had was dead and not viable. Mary knocks Sublime unconscious and she and Deathstrike manages to escape before Psylocke comes to check on Sublime. Deathstrike and Mary makes their way to Troms, Norway, where they find Amora, who has been exiled by Thor and stripped of her powers. Deathstrike promises Amora that she will make her powerful once again. Amora brings Deathstrike and Mary to where the Arkea meteorite is located when Mary wants to renegotiate the terms of her hire and want to become partners. Deathstrike says it was not just a partnership, but the formation of a new Sisterhood of Mutants. With the live Arkea taking possession of Reiko, she empowers Deathstrike, Mary and Amora. Deathstrike and her Sisterhood manage to escape the X-Men and Monet with Arkea activating several sentinels under the ocean. The mental conflict between Ana and Yuriko made Lady Deathstrike increasingly unstable. Ana Cortes grew to regret her life as a supervillain and did not like the direction Arkea was leading the Sisterhood. She notified the X-Men of the Sisterhood&#x27;s location, after she became increasingly concerned about Arkea&#x27;s bold moves such as having Amora resurrect Selene Gallio, the Black Queen. Ana flipped out and tried to get Typhoid Mary to kill her, but Mary refused. Upon Arkea asking Ana to come be a part of the procedure to resurrect Madelyne Pryor, Ana killed herself to prevent Arkea from using her further. Ana&#x27;s death didn&#x27;t stop Arkea&#x27;s plans. Arkea simply removed Yuriko&#x27;s consciousness from Ana&#x27;s body and placed it in Reiko&#x27;s body along with Arkea&#x27;s own. Ana&#x27;s body was spliced with Jean Grey&#x27;s DNA in order to enable it to host Madelyne Pryor&#x27;s consciousness. Amora then completed the resurrection of Madelyne Pryor. After the X-Men&#x27;s confrontation with the Sisterhood, Karima leaves the X-Men to team up with Sabra and investigate the Cortes crime family. Though Arkea was destroyed by the X-Men, Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s consciousness remained intact inside Reiko&#x27;s body.

The Reavers later arrive in Killhorn Falls with Lady Deathstrike and attempt to hunt down Logan for good. As the Reavers attacked Killhorn Falls, Old Man Logan single-handedly killed all the Reavers soldiers and confronted Lady Deathstrike before saving Maureen. After being wounded multiple times, Logan manages to defeat Lady Deathstrike, as she started limping away when Logan blacked out. Thinking that he failed to protect Maureen from the chaos, Logan decided to set-off to find Lady Deathstrike.

While in hiding during the &quot;Weapons of Mutant Destruction&quot; storyline, Lady Deathstrike is discovered and captured by the new Weapon X. While held in their captivity, she is experimented on. This experiment led to her nanotechnology being used in their creation of Weapon H.

===Hunt for Wolverine===
During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Lady Deathstrike is seen at Chester&#x27;s Bar where she tells Daken and Sabretooth about what the Reavers discovered when they went after Wolverine and that he has recently been sighted alive. The three of them go on the trail of Wolverine where they arrive in Maybelle, Arizona. Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike continue searching Maybelle for Wolverine when they are attacked by zombies made from those at a birthday party. One of them bites Sabretooth as Lady Deathstrike gets him away from the zombies. Both of them wonder where the zombies came from. As they get to their car, it suddenly explodes. Sabretooth starts running and finds that his zombie bite is not healing. Sabretooth comes across more zombies as he starts killing them with Lady Deathstrike not far behind him. Both of them take refuge in a garage. When Daken catches up to them, Lady Deathstrike and Sabretooth are informed of a glowing green device in the power station that has to do with the zombies and they must fight their way past the zombies to destroy it before Maybelle is burned to the ground. While fighting zombies and Soteira Killteam Nine, Lady Deathstrike discovers that one of the soldiers from Soteira Killteam Nine is a zombified version of her father who stabs Lady Deathstrike. Lady Deathstrike recovers and continues her fight with her father until Lord Dark Wind cuts off her left hand. Using her right hand, Lady Deathstrike stabs her father in the neck. Then she does the same thing to a zombified Graydon Creed. After telling Sabretooth that the adamantium they tracked was her father&#x27;s adamantium and learning that Daken is dead, Lady Deathstrike accompanies Sabretooth to where the glowing device is and destroy the device before Maybelle can be burned to the ground. The next day, Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike carjack someone outside a diner as Sabretooth suggests to Lady Deathstrike to have her Reaver friends get her a new hand. Lady Deathstrike tells Sabretooth to shut up and drive.

===Possessed by Adamantine===
Lady Deathstrike is later attacked by an Adamantine-possessed Cyber where she gets possessed by the Adamantine. Then she assists Cyber in doing the same thing to Constrictor II.

==Personality and themes==
Psychologist Suzana E. Flores argues that Lady Deathstrike evinces traits of obsessive compulsive disorder in her drive to obtain Wolverine&#x27;s adamantium. As Flores characterizes it, Lady Deathstrike &quot;&#x27;needs&#x27; the adamantium to credibly establish or validate her self-worth,&quot; but even if she were to achieve this, her personality would lead her to &quot;find some other victim or idea over which to obsess.&quot;

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Deathstrike was transformed into a cyborg by Spiral and the &quot;Body Shop&quot; using alien technology of Mojo&#x27;s dimension, with later modifications by Donald Pierce. She has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and agility. Deathstrike&#x27;s skeleton has been artificially laced with molecules of adamantium, rendering her skeletal structure physically unbreakable. Later, in the pages of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, it was shown that Spiral used magic to infuse the metal into Deathstrike&#x27;s body. her fingers have been replaced by five long adamantium claws replacing each finger of each hand. Aside from being as indestructible as her skeleton, these nails are capable of slicing through virtually any substance other than adamantium itself and Captain America&#x27;s shield. She is capable of telescoping these claws to twice their usual length. She could also interface with computers, allowing direct data access to her brain&#x27;s memory centers. Although her standard form is visibly that of a cyborg, she uses disguises when necessary. She is a trained assassin and skilled in various Asian martial arts. Lady Deathstrike is incredibly qualified with swords, and while she prefers stealth and subtlety in her killings, she is emotionally disturbed, which interferes with her effectiveness. Deathstrike suffers from mental instability; she is an unbalanced fanatic, a condition worsened by her transformation into a cyborg.

Before she received her cybernetic enhancements, Deathstrike used a special five-foot steel katana that was electromagnetically tempered and sheathed in energy. The energy sheath enabled the sword to cut through most substances and made it as resilient as adamantium. She has also used shuriken, nunchakus, a high-powered, long-range blaster that fires armor-piercing explosive bullets, and wristbands containing adamantium detectors. She also wore modified Japanese battle armor, which could withstand even superhuman blows. Her items were constructed by weapon smiths of Lord Dark Wind&#x27;s organization.

Deathstrike later received an upgrade that provides her with a kind of &quot;cybernetic healing factor&quot; that functions similarly, although not as efficiently, to Wolverine&#x27;s.

Lady Deathstrike is fluent in both English and Japanese, and an accomplished pilot of various air and sea-craft.

The left side of Yuriko Oyama&#x27;s face was scarred in a ritual design by her father; this was apparently surgically repaired when she became a cyborg.

Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s original body was destroyed. She became a digital consciousness. She was downloaded into Ana Cortes, who became her host and the new Lady Deathstrike until Ana killed herself. Yuriko&#x27;s mind was placed into the body of her friend Reiko, who currently hosts her alongside Arkea.

==Other versions==
===Amalgam===
In the &quot;Amalgam Comics&quot; universe, Lady Deathstrike was merged with Talia al Ghul of DC Comics and became Lady Talia. She was the lover of Logan Wayne aka Dark Claw, but swore revenge when Dark Claw murdered her father, Ra&#x27;s Al-Pocalypse, to prevent him from unleashing a deadly chemical on the world. She became cybernetically enhanced and ambushed Dark Claw in his cave after tying up his sidekick, the Sparrow. In a choice between love and revenge, she nearly murders Logan, but his healing factor allows him to recover from the injury.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Lady Deathstrike has also appeared in Ultimate Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; line. There, her connection lies mainly with Storm, instead of Wolverine as in the original storyline. As Yuriko (or &#x27;Yuri&#x27;), she taught Storm how to hotwire vehicles and be a car thief. The two later had a falling out, and Yuri ended up being run over by a truck. Yuri survived, but needed to use a wheelchair. There, Dr. Cornelius of Weapon X offered to have her shattered body rebuilt with adamantium, extendable claws, and an accelerated healing factor based on Wolverine&#x27;s DNA, which would allow her to have her revenge against Storm, though if she wanted to kill Storm she would have to kill Storm&#x27;s friend Wolverine as well. Yuri agreed, and underwent the modifications. She later went after Storm and Wolverine, but was defeated, and later imprisoned by S.H.I.E.L.D.

While imprisoned at the Triskelion, she encountered the X-Men Dazzler and Angel (who were out searching for their friends, elsewhere in the base). After Dazzler taunted Yuri, saying how Storm had mentioned her to them, the power went out, allowing Yuri to escape her cell and stab Dazzler through the stomach. Before she could do anything else, the mutant Longshot (another prisoner at the Triskelion) snapped Yuri&#x27;s neck. Whether or not this attack killed her is unknown. She has previously survived being struck by lightning and smashed by a falling tree. Dazzler survived Yuri&#x27;s attack, remaining in a coma for a few weeks before awakening.

===Wolverine Noir===
A non-powered Yuriko briefly appears in &quot;Wolverine Noir&quot; when Logan investigated the Bowery and faced off against her, who mistakenly thought he works for Creed. The two discusses about Logan finding his brother Dog, but when Yuriko was about to kiss him, he refused and she disappeared. She later showed up deceased having been killed by Rose, Logan&#x27;s ex girlfriend.

<text>Dajti is a mountain located in central Albania, just east of the capital, Tirana. Part of the Skanderbeg Mountains range, it stretches from Shkalla e Tujanit in the northwest to Qafa e Priskës in the southeast, at a length of and a width of . Its highest peak, &quot;Maja e Dajtit&quot;, reaches a height of . Other peaks include Maja e Cem Rrumit and Maja e Tujanit .

== Geology ==
Composed primarily of Cretaceous and Paleogene limestone, with notable karst formations, its upper section is barren of vegetation while the lower section, up to , consists of flysch. The undulating mountain ridge features a steep eastern slope and a western slope that gradually descends onto the plain of Tirana, highlighted by an ancient marine terrace known as Fusha e Dajtit, formed during the Miocene era.

== Climate ==
Dajti experiences a cool mountain climate with temperatures averaging at heights of about . Temperatures are the coldest during the month of January () and the hottest during July (). The average amount of precipitation is , a good amount of which is accumulated snow.

== Biodiversity ==
The western slope of the mountain consists of three distinct vegetation belts. The lower belt, up to , is covered by Mediterranean shrubs like strawberry tree, juniper and heather; the middle belt, ascending from , is dominated by an oak forest; the upper belt, above , is covered by a mixture of beech and conifer trees. The peak of the mountain is devoid of vegetation and serves as the base for RTSH&#x27;s central antenna. 

On the eastern slope, the vegetation changes, with a smaller Mediterranean shrub area and the presence of oaks, chestnuts, and other trees which are absent on the western slope. 

The section of the mountain and its surrounding habitat are designated as a national park.

<doc id="397007" wikidata="Q5749018" url="?curid=397007" title="Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma">
<text>Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (cSCC), also known as squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous-cell skin cancer, is one of the three principal types of skin cancer, alongside basal-cell carcinoma and melanoma. cSCC typically presents as a hard lump with a scaly surface, though it may also present as an ulcer. Onset and development often occurs over several months.

Compared to basal cell carcinoma, cSCC is more likely to spread to distant areas. When confined to the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, the pre-invasive or &quot;in situ&quot; form of cSCC is termed Bowen&#x27;s disease.
The most significant risk factor for cSCC is extensive lifetime exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight. Additional risk factors include prior scars, chronic wounds, actinic keratosis, lighter skin susceptible to sunburn, Bowen&#x27;s disease, exposure to arsenic, radiation therapy, tobacco smoking, poor immune system function, previous basal cell carcinoma, and HPV infection. The risk associated with UV radiation correlates with cumulative exposure rather than early-life exposure. Tanning beds have emerged as a significant source of UV radiation.

Genetic predispositions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum and certain forms of epidermolysis bullosa, also increase susceptibility to cSCC. The condition originates from squamous cells located in the skin&#x27;s upper layers. Diagnosis typically relies on skin examination, and is confirmed through skin biopsy.

Research, both &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot;, indicates a crucial role for the upregulation of FGFR2, part of the fibroblast growth factor receptor immunoglobin family, in cSCC cell progression. Mutations in the TPL2 gene leads to overexpression of FGFR2, which activates the mTORC1 and AKT pathways in primary and metastatic cSCC cell lines. Utilization of a &quot;pan FGFR inhibitor&quot; has shown to reduce cell migration and proliferation in cSCC &quot;in vitro&quot; studies.

Preventive measures against cSCC include minimizing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen. Surgical removal is the typical treatment method, employing simple excision for minor cases or Mohs surgery for more extensive instances. Other options include cryotherapy and radiation therapy. For cases with distant metastasis, chemotherapy or biologic therapy may be employed.

As of 2015, approximately 2.2 million individuals globally were living with cSCC at any given time, constituting about 20% of all skin cancer cases. In the United States, approximately 12% of males and 7% of females are diagnosed with cSCC at some point in their lives. While prognosis remains favorable in the absence of metastasis, upon distant spread the five-year survival rate is markedly reduced to ~34%. In 2015, global deaths attributed to cSCC numbered around 52,000. The average age at diagnosis is approximately 66 years. Following successful treatment of an initial cSCC lesion, there is a substantial risk of developing subsequent lesions.

==Signs and symptoms==
SCC of the skin begins as a small nodule and as it enlarges the center becomes necrotic and sloughs and the nodule turns into an ulcer, and generally are developed from an actinic keratosis. Once keratinocytes begin to grow uncontrollably, they have the potential to become cancerous and produce cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma.
* The lesion caused by cSCC is often asymptomatic
* Ulcer or reddish skin plaque that is slow growing
* Intermittent bleeding from the tumor, especially on the lip
* The clinical appearance is highly variable
* Usually the tumor presents as an ulcerated lesion with hard, raised edges
* The tumor may be in the form of a hard plaque or a papule, often with an opalescent quality, with tiny blood vessels
* The tumor can lie below the level of the surrounding skin, and eventually ulcerates and invades the underlying tissue
* The tumor commonly presents on sun-exposed areas (e.g. back of the hand, scalp, lip, and superior surface of pinna)
* On the lip, the tumor forms a small ulcer, which fails to heal and bleeds intermittently
* Evidence of chronic skin photodamage, as in multiple actinic keratoses (solar keratoses)
* The tumor grows relatively slowly

===Spread===
* Unlike basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) has a higher risk of metastasis.
* Risk of metastasis is higher clinically in SCC arising in scars, on the lower lips, ears, or mucosa, and occurring in immunosuppressed and solid organ transplant patients. Risk of metastasis is also higher in SCC that are &gt; 2 cm in diameter, growth into the fat layer and along nerves, presence of lymphovascular invasion, poorly differentiated cell architecture on histology, or thickness greater than 6 mm.

==Causes==
Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma is the second-most common cancer of the skin (after basal-cell carcinoma, but more common than melanoma). It usually occurs in areas exposed to the sun. Sunlight exposure and immunosuppression are risk factors for SCC of the skin, with chronic sun exposure being the strongest environmental risk factor. There is a risk of metastasis starting more than 10 years after diagnosable appearance of squamous-cell carcinoma, but the risk is low, though much higher than with basal-cell carcinoma. Squamous-cell cancers of the lip and ears have high rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis. In a recent study, it has also been shown that the deletion or severe down-regulation of a gene titled Tpl2 (tumor progression locus 2) may be involved in the progression of normal keratinocytes into becoming squamous-cell carcinoma.

cSCC represents about 20% of the non-melanoma skin cancers; 80-90% of cSCCs with metastatic potential are located on the head and neck.

Tobacco smoking also increases the risk for cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma.

The vast majority of cSCC cases are located on exposed skin, and are often the result of ultraviolet exposure. cSCC usually occurs on portions of the body commonly exposed to the sun; the face, ears, neck, hands, or arms. The primary sign is a growing bump that may have a rough, scaly surface, and flat, reddish patches.
Unlike basal-cell carcinoma, cSCC carries a higher risk of metastasis than does basal-cell carcinoma, and may spread to the regional lymph nodes,

&quot;Erythroplasia of Queyrat&quot; (SCC in situ of the glans or prepuce in males, M or the vulva in females.) may be induced by human papilloma virus. It is reported to occur in the corneoscleral limbus. Erythroplasia of Queyrat may also occur on the anal mucosa or the oral mucosa.

Genetically, cSCC tumors harbor high frequencies of NOTCH and p53 mutations as well as less frequent alterations in histone acetyltransferase EP300, subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex PBRM1, DNA-repair deubiquitinase USP28, and NF-κB signaling regulator CHUK.

A significant proportion of cSCC and its precursor lesions carry UV-induced p53 mutations. In fact, these mutations are present in up to 90% of cSCC cases. The detection of p53 mutations in precursor lesions indicates that this could be an early event in the development of squamous cell carcinoma.

===Immunosuppression===
People who have received solid organ transplants are at a significantly increased risk of developing squamous-cell carcinoma due to the use of chronic immunosuppressive medication. While the risk of developing all skin cancers increases with these medications, this effect is particularly severe for cSCC, with hazard ratios as high as 250 being reported, versus 40 for basal cell carcinoma. The incidence of cSCC development increases with time posttransplant. Heart and lung transplant recipients are at the highest risk of developing cSCC due to more intensive immunosuppressive medications used.

Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma in individuals on immunotherapy or who have lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g. leukemia) tend to be much more aggressive, regardless of their location. The risk of cSCC, and non-melanoma skin cancers generally, varies with the immunosuppressive drug regimen chosen. The risk is greatest with calcineurin inhibitors like cyclosporine and tacrolimus, and least with mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus and everolimus. The antimetabolites azathioprine and mycophenolic acid have an intermediate risk profile.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is confirmed via skin biopsy of the tissue or tissues suspected to be affected by SCC.
The pathological appearance of a squamous-cell cancer varies with the depth of the biopsy. For that reason, a biopsy including the subcutaneous tissue and basilar epithelium, to the surface is necessary for correct diagnosis. The performance of a shave biopsy (see skin biopsy) might not acquire enough information for a diagnosis. An inadequate biopsy might be read as actinic keratosis with follicular involvement. A deeper biopsy down to the dermis or subcutaneous tissue might reveal the true cancer. An excision biopsy is ideal, but not practical in most cases. An incisional or punch biopsy is preferred. A shave biopsy is least ideal, especially if only the superficial portion is acquired.

===Histological characteristics===
Histopathologically, the epidermis in cSCC &quot;in situ&quot; (Bowen&#x27;s disease) will show hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. There will also be marked acanthosis with elongation and thickening of the rete ridges. These changes will overly keratinocytic cells which are often highly atypical and may in fact have a more unusual appearance than invasive cSCC. The atypia spans the full thickness of the epidermis, with the keratinocytes demonstrating intense mitotic activity, pleomorphism, and greatly enlarged nuclei. They will also show a loss of maturity and polarity, giving the epidermis a disordered or &quot;windblown&quot; appearance.

Two types of multinucleated cells may be seen: the first will present as a multinucleated giant cell, and the second will appear as a dyskeratotic cell engulfed in the cytoplasm of a keratinocyte. Occasionally, cells of the upper epidermis will undergo vacuolization, demonstrating an abundant and strongly eosinophilic cytoplasm. There may be a mild to moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltrate detected in the upper dermis.

===In situ disease===
Bowen&#x27;s disease is essentially equivalent to and used interchangeably with cSCC &quot;in situ&quot;, when not having invaded through the basement membrane. Depending on source, it is classified as precancerous or cSCC &quot;in situ&quot; (technically cancerous but non-invasive). In cSCC &quot;in situ&quot; (Bowen&#x27;s disease), atypical squamous cells proliferate through the whole thickness of the epidermis. The entire tumor is confined to the epidermis and does not invade into the dermis. The cells are often highly atypical under the microscope, and may in fact look more unusual than the cells of some invasive squamous-cell carcinomas.

Erythroplasia of Queyrat is a particular type of Bowen&#x27;s disease that can arise on the glans or prepuce in males, and the vulva in females. It mainly occurs in uncircumcised males, over the age of 40.

===Invasive disease===
In invasive cSCC, tumor cells infiltrate through the basement membrane. The infiltrate can be somewhat difficult to detect in the early stages of invasion: however, additional indicators such as full thickness epidermal atypia and the involvement of hair follicles can be used to facilitate the diagnosis. Later stages of invasion are characterized by the formation of nests of atypical tumor cells in the dermis, often with a corresponding inflammatory infiltrate.

===Degree of differentiation===
==Prevention==
Appropriate sun-protective clothing, use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen with at least SPF 50, and avoidance of intense sun exposure may prevent skin cancer. A 2016 review of sunscreen for preventing cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma found insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether it was effective.

==Management==
Most cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas are removed with surgery. A few selected cases are treated with topical medication. Surgical excision with a free margin of healthy tissue is a frequent treatment modality. Radiotherapy, given as external beam radiotherapy or as brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy), can also be used to treat cSCC. There is little evidence comparing the effectiveness of different treatments for non-metastatic cSCC. Cosibelimab (Unloxcyt) was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2024, for the treatment of adults with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.

Mohs surgery is frequently utilized; considered the treatment of choice for squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, physicians have also utilized the method for the treatment of squamous-cell carcinoma of the mouth, throat, and neck. An equivalent method of the CCPDMA standards can be utilized by a pathologist in the absence of a Mohs-trained physician. Radiation therapy is often used afterward in high risk cancer or patient types. Radiation or radiotherapy can also be a standalone option in treating cSCC.

As a non-invasive option brachytherapy serves a painless possibility to treat in particular but not only difficult to operate areas like the earlobes or genitals. An example of this kind of therapy is the high-dose brachytherapy Rhenium-SCT which makes use of the beta rays emitting property of rhenium-188. The radiation source is enclosed in a compound which is applied to a thin protection foile directly over the lesion. This way the radiation source can be applied to complex locations and minimize radiation to healthy tissue.

After removal of the cancer, closure of the skin for patients with a decreased amount of skin laxity involves a split-thickness skin graft. A donor site is chosen and enough skin is removed so that the donor site can heal on its own. Only the epidermis and a partial amount of dermis is taken from the donor site which allows the donor site to heal. Skin can be harvested using either a mechanical dermatome or Humby knife.

Electrodessication and curettage (EDC) can be done on selected squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin. In areas where cSCC is known to be non-aggressive, and where the patient is not immunosuppressed, EDC can be performed with good to adequate cure rate.

Treatment options for cSCC &quot;in situ&quot; (Bowen&#x27;s disease) include photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid, cryotherapy, topical 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod, and excision. A meta-analysis showed evidence that PDT is more effective than cryotherapy and has better cosmetic outcomes. There is generally a lack of evidence comparing the effectiveness of all treatment options.

High-risk squamous-cell carcinoma, as defined by that occurring around the eye, ear, or nose, is of large size, is poorly differentiated, and grows rapidly, requires more aggressive, multidisciplinary management.

Nodal spread:

# Surgical block dissection if palpable nodes or in cases of Marjolin&#x27;s ulcers but the benefit of prophylactic block lymph node dissection with Marjolin&#x27;s ulcers is not proven.
# Radiotherapy
# Adjuvant therapy may be considered in those with high-risk cSCC even in the absence of evidence for local metastasis. Imiquimod (Aldara) has been used with success for squamous-cell carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; of the skin and the penis, but the morbidity and discomfort of the treatment is severe. An advantage is the cosmetic result: after treatment, the skin resembles normal skin without the usual scarring and morbidity associated with standard excision. Imiquimod is not FDA-approved for any squamous-cell carcinoma.

In general, squamous-cell carcinomas have a high risk of local recurrence, and up to 50% do recur. Frequent skin exams with a dermatologist is recommended after treatment.

==Prognosis==
The long-term outcome of squamous-cell carcinoma is dependent upon several factors: the sub-type of the carcinoma, available treatments, location and severity, and various patient health-related variables (accompanying diseases, age, etc.). Generally, the long-term outcome is positive, with a metastasis rate of 1.9-5.2% and a mortality rate of 1.5-3.4%.

When it does metastasize, the most commonly involved organs are the lungs, brain, bone and other skin locations. Squamous-cell carcinoma occurring in immunosuppressed people (such as those with organ transplant, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) the risk of developing cSCC and having metastasis is much higher than the general population.

One study found squamous-cell carcinoma of the penis had a much greater rate of mortality than some other forms of squamous-cell carcinoma, that is, about 23%, although this relatively high mortality rate may be associated with possibly latent diagnosis of the disease due to patients avoiding genital exams until the symptoms are debilitating, or refusal to submit to a possibly scarring operation upon the genitalia.

==Epidemiology==

The incidence of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma continues to rise around the world. This is theorized to be due to several factors; including an aging population, a greater incidence of those who are immunocompromised and the increasing use of tanning beds.

A recent study estimated that there are between 180,000 and 400,000 cases of cSCC in the United States in 2013. Risk factors for cSCC varies with age, gender, race, geography, and genetics. The incidence of cSCC increases with age and with those 75 years or older being at a 5-10 times increased risk of developing cSCC as compared with those who are younger than 55 years old. Males are affected with cSCC at a ratio of 3:1 in comparison to females. Those who have light skin, red or blonde hair and light colored eyes are also at increased risk.

Squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin can be found on all areas of the body but is most common on frequently sun-exposed areas, such as the face, legs and arms. Solid organ transplant recipients (heart, lung, liver, pancreas, among others) are also at a heightened risk of developing aggressive, high-risk cSCC. There are also a few rare congenital diseases predisposed to cutaneous malignancy. In certain geographic locations, exposure to arsenic in well water or from industrial sources may significantly increase the risk of cSCC.

<text>Thomas Edward Walter (born October 30, 1970) is an American musician, best known for his alternative rock band Abandoned Pools and as the former bassist and one of the founding members of Eels.

== Early years and Eels ==
Tommy Walter was raised in Westlake Village. His father was an airplane pilot; his mother a stewardess. His father is from Canada, and was almost 47 when Tommy was born. He grew up in a modest, middle-class household. He began playing bass at a young age, and was formally trained on the French horn in college. He attended the University of Southern California, followed by Pacific University. He began teaching classical music theory, and worked with local Los Angeles area musicians.

He met with singer-songwriter Mark Oliver Everett (known as E), and Butch Norton and formed Eels. Prior to their founding, E had already released two records by himself, under his single-letter pseudonym, and their name was decided upon so that their music would be placed next to E&#x27;s solo works. However, it was in retrospect that they realized that there were bands that would be placed in between, such as Eagles.

Their collaborations led to refining songs that E had previously written, as well as creating new material. They released their debut album, &quot;Beautiful Freak&quot;, in 1996. However, after a year of touring, Walter left the band. In an interview, he stated his dissatisfaction with E&#x27;s personality, and the loss of the amount of creative input that both Butch and himself had prior to the success of Beautiful Freak.

Soon after, he formed a band called Metromax. They shortly changed their name to Tely, and released an album over the Internet. However, the band didn&#x27;t garner much success, and it soon evolved into Walter&#x27;s solo project, Abandoned Pools.

== History ==

===&quot;Humanistic&quot; (2001–2004) ===
Walter, using new material, as well as several songs he had worked on beforehand in both Tely and Metromax, composed, recorded, and released his solo album, &quot;Humanistic&quot;, in 2001 on Extasy Records. While being the creative force behind the project, other musicians contributed to the project, such as Angie Hart of Frente!, who sang backing vocals to &quot;Start Over,&quot; &quot;Ruin Your Life,&quot; &quot;Sunny Day,&quot; and &quot;Seed.&quot;

Although a solo project, he recruited a touring band, featuring Leah Randi and Bryan Head filling out the ranks of bassist and drummer, respectively. They had several successful tours, going across the country and headlining with acts such as Garbage, A Perfect Circle and Lenny Kravitz. They also appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot; and two videos, &quot;Mercy Kiss&quot;, and &quot;The Remedy&quot;, were released. Monster, another video, was composed of shots taken while on touring, but wasn&#x27;t released for years, via MTV&#x27;s website.

In 2002 they performed the theme song for the short-lived Teletoon (also broadcast on MTV) animated series &quot;Clone High&quot;, called the &quot;Clone High&quot; theme song. Many of their songs can be heard in the background during the show. Walter also voiced himself in a brief appearance in the final episode, &quot;&quot;. After &quot;Clone High&quot; was dropped by MTV, however, the band stopped its touring.

===&quot;Armed to the Teeth&quot; (2005–2007)===
While keeping in touch with his fanbase and caring for his sick cat, Iggy, Walter began working on material over the next few years, preparing to release another album. After a relationship of his came to a rough conclusion, he was picked up by Universal, and wrote several new songs for his next album, citing his personal life, as well as politics, as his main inspirations.

Teaming up with Bryan Head once more and bringing in guitarist Sean Woolstenhulme, Walter started work in 2004 to record his next album. In June 2005 they released an EP, consisting of a few songs from the new album along with b-sides and demos, called &quot;The Reverb EP&quot;. This was followed by the full album, &quot;Armed to the Teeth&quot;, in September 2005

In January 2006, Walter wrote in his online journal that Universal Records had stopped promoting the album. He subsequently quit the label, also noting that Abandoned Pools is once again a one-man project. He has since created two side projects—Glacier Hiking, an alternative rock band, and Oliver the Penguin, an electronica project.

===&quot;Sublime Currency&quot; (2011–2012)===
On May 3, 2011, Abandoned Pools released the song &quot;In Silence&quot;, available in all digital stores, as the first single from the upcoming album &quot;Sublime Currency&quot;. On June 7, 2011, the second single, &quot;Marigolds&quot; was released in all digital stores.

On January 30, 2012, Abandoned Pools revealed that they had signed onto a new record label, Tooth &amp; Nail Records, and that &quot;Sublime Currency&quot; would be released under this label. They also mentioned that the release date of the third album will be revealed &quot;soon&quot;.

On April 6, 2021, Walter released a Kickstarter campaign for making a potential 5th album, 8 years after his last album, Somnambulist, due to articles revealing that a revival of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Clone High&quot; was in development, is going to be released on HBO Max. The Kickstarter included a video which contained audio demos of the songs that would be recorded for said album. 
The campaign was a success getting a total of $43,782 from 486 backers. 
Then, a month later he would go on to transfer the campaign to Indiegogo. The success continued and the campaign managed to get to a total of $44,606 from 498 backers.

On December 4, 2023, Walter announced on Instagram that Abandoned Pools&#x27; fifth studio album would be released January 16, 2024. The release of the album, &quot;The Haunted House&quot;, was pushed back from that date and ultimately released on January 25, 2024 for Kickstarter and Indiegogo supporters. On February 1, Walter announced that the first single from the album, &quot;Aliens&quot;, would be released on March 1, with the album itself released on March 29 for the general public.

<doc id="397025" wikidata="Q151634" url="?curid=397025" title="Ace of Base">
<text>Ace of Base is a Swedish pop group formed in 1987, originally consisting of siblings Jonas, Linn, and Jenny Berggren, with Ulf Ekberg.

They achieved worldwide success following the release of their debut album, &quot;Happy Nation&quot;, in 1992. Later re-issued as &quot;The Sign&quot;, it was certified nine times platinum in the United States and was the best-selling album of 1994. One of the most successful debut albums of all time, it was the first to produce three No. 1 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Top 40 chart: &quot;All That She Wants&quot;, &quot;The Sign&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Around&quot;.

The group continued to score hit singles throughout the 1990s, with songs such as &quot;Beautiful Life&quot;, &quot;Lucky Love&quot;, &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, and &quot;Life Is a Flower&quot;. They have sold 30 million copies of their first four studio albums, making them the third most successful Swedish group of all time, behind ABBA and Roxette.

Despite being largely inactive since 2012, the group has never officially disbanded. In the last decade, they have released several demo tracks, first via their Facebook page and later, in 2015, on the compilation album &quot;Hidden Gems&quot;. A follow-up titled &quot;Hidden Gems, Vol. 2&quot; was included in the 2020 box set &quot;All That She Wants: The Classic Collection&quot;. Jenny Berggren continues to perform the group&#x27;s hits in solo concerts around the world.

== History ==
=== 1987–1992: Formation ===
In 1987, after several years as part of a new wave and punk cover band called G Konrad (named after Hungarian author György Konrád), Jonas Berggren formed a band with two friends, Johnny Lindén and Niklas Tränk, for a school project; his sisters Linn and Jenny later joined as vocalists. The new band went through several names: New Arbat Avenue, after an avenue in Moscow; CAD (Computer-Aided Disco); and Tech-Noir, which is French for &quot;black technology,&quot; inspired by a nightclub in the film &quot;The Terminator&quot;. They toured the clubs of Sweden with original material, creating techno inspired by 1980s Italo disco and house music.

Johnny left the group in 1989, and Niklas made his departure known by failing to turn up to a gig at Bältespännarparken in Gothenburg on 4 August 1990, instead attending a Rolling Stones concert across town. Jonas asked his friend Ulf Ekberg to stand in for Niklas. Inspired by a Jamaican reggae band who resided in a studio next door to theirs, they experimented with a fusion of reggae and pop – dubbed &quot;China reggae&quot; by their Jamaican friends – which became the band&#x27;s trademark sound.

After responding to an ad in the paper &quot;Göteborgs-Posten&quot;, the new quartet started working in the studio with record producer John Ballard, and decided to adopt a new name to make a fresh start, as well as to avoid confusion with another band with the same name (Tech Noir) who were attracting bad reviews. Linn said: &quot;No one could pronounce the name of the group and nobody could remember it.&quot; They settled on Ace of Base in early 1991, after Ulf was inspired by the Motörhead song &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;. In a 2018 interview, Ulf explained: &quot;I was hungover, watching MTV and I saw Motörhead&#x27;s video for their song &#x27;Ace of Spades&#x27;. I liked the name and I thought I&#x27;d play around with those words. [...] Then I thought of our studio and how it&#x27;s our base&quot;.

The group continued performing in the clubs of Gothenburg but struggled to gain recognition, partly due to the local preference for heavy metal music over techno. They sent out demo cassettes to numerous record companies, but all received refusals. In May 1991, Jonas and Ulf traveled to various record companies in Stockholm, including Polar Music, which requested that they record more songs first, and SweMix, which expressed interest but did not have the capacity to work with them until autumn.

In July, Klas Lunding at Telegram Records arranged for the group to record a new version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in their newly renovated Decibel Studio, but did not offer them a recording contract. Jonas recounts: When it had just been finished, Martin Dodd (Head of A&amp;R at independent Danish label Mega Records) called and shouted: &quot;Do not sign anything, do not sign anything!&quot; They wanted everything from us, while Telegram only wanted the reggae songs and no up-tempos. We had already recorded a single with Telegram, but hadn&#x27;t signed anything. Klas is not the fastest in the world, so to speakand that was perhaps lucky for us. So Mega bought the master tape from Klas for 34,000 SEK.

&quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; was serviced to radio and nightclubs in Sweden in early 1992, reaching Gothenburg&#x27;s local Jockeytoppen chart in March, which led to an invitation to perform on the music television channel ZTV. However, the record failed to gain traction in Sweden, prompting Mega to shift focus to Denmark. After servicing the single to media three times, it was finally released commercially at the end of June 1992, entering the Danish singles chart at No. 6 before rising to No. 2.

=== 1992–1994: International success and &quot;Happy Nation&quot;/&quot;The Sign&quot; ===
Following the success of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in Denmark, the group continued to work on new music. After hearing Kayo&#x27;s &quot;Another Mother&quot; in a record store – a top 20 hit in Sweden in 1990 – Jonas and Ulf decided that it was the exact sound they wanted to create.

In early 1992, they sent producer Denniz PoP a demo tape that included a song titled &quot;Mr. Ace&quot;. Initially, he was not particularly impressed, but the tape became stuck in the cassette player of his car. As a result, he had to listen to it repeatedly and gradually realized the song&#x27;s potential. Although he had lost the band&#x27;s contact details, when they called him a few months later, he invited them to his SweMix studio to re-record the song in July 1992. The song was eventually titled &quot;All That She Wants&quot; and, upon its release at the end of August, it quickly ascended to No. 1 on the Danish chart, while the previous single remained at No. 2. Eager to release an LP for the Christmas market, Mega Records pressured the band for an album, which was recorded and mixed in just a few weeks.

The album, &quot;Happy Nation&quot;, was released on 2 November 1992, in Denmark, and its success generated interest throughout Europe. A pan-European license was signed with Metronome/PolyGram (now Universal Music), but the American division declined to pursue the band. Within a few months, &quot;All That She Wants&quot; reached No. 3 in Sweden and spent eight weeks at No. 1 in Germany. In various European countries, &quot;Happy Nation&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Magic&quot; were released as additional singles following the album&#x27;s release.

In May 1993, &quot;All That She Wants&quot; solidified its European success by topping the charts for three weeks in the United Kingdom. However, despite Mega Records&#x27;s efforts to secure a distribution deal in the United States, the response was always the same: &quot;This band will never work in the States.&quot; Eventually, Clive Davis, founder of Arista Records, heard the song playing on the radio whilst on vacation on his yacht, and rushed to sign a licence with Mega for the Americas. In October and November 1993, &quot;All That She Wants&quot; reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as in Australia.

The group had already started work on a second album, with the working title of &quot;The Sign&quot;, named after one of the new tracks they had written. However, concerned about the sales of import copies of &quot;Happy Nation&quot;, Davis decided to modify the track list of the original LP by adding three new tracks and re-titling it &quot;The Sign&quot;. Released in the US on 23 November 1993, the album remained in the top three of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 for 26 consecutive weeks and was nominated for &quot;Best Pop Album&quot; at the 1995 Grammy Awards. The updated album was released in Europe as &quot;Happy Nation (US Version)&quot;. Collectively, the various versions of the album reached the No. 1 position in at least 14 countries and sold over 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling debut albums of all time. It was also one of the best-selling albums of 1994.

The second U.S. single was the album&#x27;s title track, &quot;The Sign&quot;, released on 14 December. It proved to be even more successful than the first single, spending six weeks at No. 1 and becoming the best-selling single of 1994. The song also achieved significant international success, peaking at No. 2 in both the UK and Sweden, and reaching No. 1 in Germany; in Australia, it topped the charts for four weeks. At the request of Clive Davis, the group&#x27;s next single was &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Around&quot;. This song had previously been released by Tina Turner as the B-side of her single &quot;Typical Male&quot; (1986) and had reached No. 1 in the UK for Aswad in 1988. The cover version achieved top 5 placements in the US, UK, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. Promotion for the album concluded with the final single release, &quot;Living in Danger&quot;, which also became a top 40 hit internationally and was performed in front of the Brandenburg Gate at the first-ever MTV Europe Music Awards in Berlin in November 1994.

The band became embroiled in controversy when, on 27 March 1993, the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; reported that Ulf had been a member of a skinhead gang during his teenage years, prior to his association with Ace of Base. Linn commented in 1993, &quot;Ulf gave all that up long ago, and my family had nothing to do with any of that in the first place.&quot; In 2013, the story resurfaced in a report by &quot;Vice&quot;, which referenced an unauthorized CD released in 1998 titled &quot;Uffe Was a Nazi!&quot;, containing songs with racist content purportedly recorded by Ulf&#x27;s former band, &quot;Commit Suiside&quot;. Ulf was described as &quot;a drug and alcohol-abusing teenager, when he was a member of a neo-Nazi skinhead gang&quot;. In an interview with &quot;E!&quot;, Ulf stated, &quot;I have always been deeply regretful of that period in my life, as I strive to bring happiness to people, and during that period, I did not live up to that standard. [...] I&#x27;m truly deeply sorry for any hurt and disappointment this has caused for our fans, and I really hope that we clearly have stated that Ace of Base never shared any of these opinions and strongly oppose all extremist opinions on both the right and left wing.&quot;

In April 1994, an obsessed German fan broke into the Berggren family home, brandishing a knife. After managing to restrain her, the band decided they needed bodyguards. Recalling the attack in a 2016 interview, Jenny said:

&quot;She woke me up with a knife to my throat. She broke into my parents’ house when I was staying there after two years away. I woke up and she was standing over me with the knife. I was terrified. That was the darker side of fame. I remember just after I was attacked I found out that we were Number 1 in the United States. All I could think was that I almost got killed. Everyone was like, &#x27;wow, let&#x27;s have a huge party&#x27;. I didn&#x27;t want a party. I was broken.&quot;

=== 1995–1997: &quot;The Bridge&quot; ===

Following the substantial success of their debut album, the group was offered the opportunity to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York and asked to represent brands such as Pepsi and Reebok in promotional campaigns. However, after two years of traveling the world to promote their first album, the band was too exhausted to accept any of these offers. Simultaneously, their various record companies worldwide were demanding a second album promptly. To expedite the process, instead of Jonas and Ulf writing most of the album, each member was encouraged to submit their own tracks for consideration.

Ultimately, 17 tracks were selected for the second album, titled &quot;The Bridge&quot;. This album marked a significant shift in sound; alongside the reggae and dance styles that had propelled the group to fame, it featured more experimental tracks and several ballads. The lead single, &quot;Lucky Love,&quot; was a mainstream pop record that premiered in August 1995 at the World Championships in Athletics in Gothenburg. It debuted at No. 1 in Sweden upon its release in October, becoming their first chart-topper in their homeland. Additionally, it was a top 20 hit across Europe, peaking at No. 1 in Finland, No. 2 in Denmark, No. 13 in Germany, and No. 20 in the United Kingdom.

Arista Records instead opted for the more up-tempo track &quot;Beautiful Life&quot; as the first single in the US, where it peaked at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the first American and UK hit for its co-producer Max Martin. It was released as the second single from the album in most countries, also reaching No. 15 in the UK and charting in at least 17 countries. An alternative acoustic mix of &quot;Lucky Love&quot; was chosen as the second U.S. single, peaking at No. 30. &quot;Never Gonna Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; was released as the third single from the album and achieved moderate success in Europe, but failed to chart on the Hot 100 in the US. &quot;The Bridge&quot; was certified platinum in 14 countries, although it did not match the sales of the group&#x27;s debut album. In February 1996, the band performed at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in Chile, headlining alongside 2 Unlimited.

After touring Asia and Australasia in April 1996, the group temporarily withdrew from the limelight, scrapping plans to release either &quot;My Déjà Vu&quot; or &quot;Edge of Heaven&quot; as singles. They re-emerged only in 1997 for an April performance at the World Music Awards and a July concert celebrating the 20th birthday of Princess Victoria of Sweden.

=== 1998–2000: &quot;Flowers&quot; / &quot;Cruel Summer,&quot; &quot;Singles of the 90s&quot;, and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; ===
Having felt rushed to record a second album, the group were given as much time as they need to produce their third, with much of it being recorded in Jonas&#x27;s own studio, The Barn. Declaring it their best album yet, the group titled it &quot;Flowers&quot; because they believed that the songs, wildly different in style, including Motown and gospel influences, resembled a varied bouquet of flowers.

In live performances in support of the album, Linn relinquished lead vocal duties to sister Jenny, and on many promotional photos, Linn&#x27;s face was blurred. Fans were reassured that Linn was happy with her new backing role in the group, and many reasons were given for her decision, including her having damaged her voice, her aerophobia deterring her from international travel, dealing with depression, and her dislike of fame. Her vocal contributions to the album itself were also diminished, though she still appeared on the majority of the tracks.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Life Is a Flower&quot;, was released in mainland Europe in April 1998, and became the most-played track on European radio of the year. It reached the top 5 in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Hungary and in the UK, where it was certified silver. The album followed in June, hitting the top 20 in at least a dozen countries. The group&#x27;s British label London Records had requested the band record the 1983 hit &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; by Bananarama and it was selected as the second European single. Deciding that &quot;Life Is a Flower&quot; was &quot;too European in nature&quot;, Clive Davis pushed &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; as the lead single for the United States, and it brought Ace of Base back into the U.S. Top 10 for the first time in four years, being certified gold. The album was also renamed &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; and featured a different track list from the European release. For this version of the album, Davis persuaded a reluctant Linn to record the Billy Steinberg-penned ballad &quot;Everytime It Rains&quot;. &quot;Life Is a Flower&quot; was re-recorded as &quot;Whenever You&#x27;re Near Me&quot; and chosen as the second single from &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, peaking at No. 76. &quot;Travel to Romantis&quot; and &quot;Always Have, Always Will&quot; were further singles in Europe whilst &quot;Everytime It Rains&quot; was issued as a single in the UK along with a repackaged edition of &quot;Flowers&quot;.

The group returned to the studio in 1999, writing several tracks together as a quartet for the first time and recording enough demo tracks for consideration for a fourth studio album. Ulf later revealed that they had hoped to release a track called &quot;Pole Position&quot; as the lead single, with a music video featuring the Formula One champion driver Jacques Villeneuve. Several of the tracks recorded for the scrapped studio album were eventually released in demo form by Jonas via Facebook in 2011.

In November 1999, Mega Records released the best-of album &quot;Singles of the 90s&quot;, a compilation of 13 singles and 3 new songs. A new single taken from it, &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie (Always 21)&quot;, was a modest chart hit in Sweden, Finland, Germany and Switzerland, and topped the charts in Spain. &quot;Hallo Hallo&quot; followed as the second single in parts of Europe, but only found minor success. Arista Records fulfilled the group&#x27;s four-album contract in the Americas by releasing &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in March 2000. A new dance mix of &quot;Everytime It Rains&quot;, previously included on &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, was released as a radio single to promote the album. Both the single and album failed to chart in the USA.

=== 2002–2003: &quot;Da Capo&quot; ===
After a lengthy absence from the pop scene, a new single titled &quot;Beautiful Morning&quot; was released to radio in Europe in July 2002. Polydor Records announced that it was their fastest-added track to radio playlists for the year, eventually reaching No. 38 in Germany and No. 14 in Sweden upon its commercial release in September.

After several delays, Ace of Base finally released their fourth studio album, &quot;Da Capo&quot;, on September 30, 2002, in Europe, and in Japan through Toshiba EMI with a different cover and three bonus tracks. The album received only a soft release in the United Kingdom and was not released in the Americas. The title comes from the musical term &quot;da capo&quot;, which translates as &quot;back to the beginning&quot;, as the sound of the album was meant to be a return to the group&#x27;s early blend of reggae and europop. Although the album charted across much of Europe, it was not as successful as previous releases. Only Jenny and Ulf went on a promotional tour of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, Poland and Austria. Jonas chose to forego promotional activities because &quot;it was better to be two then&quot; and led to &quot;less questions&quot; about Linn&#x27;s lack of participation. Linn attended only one performance in Germany, which was her last public appearance.

&quot;The Juvenile&quot; was chosen as the album&#x27;s second single in Germany and was featured in a Christmas campaign by TV channel RTL Television. The song is a rewritten version of a track originally submitted for the James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot; in 1995. However, Clive Davis advised the band that it was not the best move for them at the time, leading to its withdrawal from consideration. In Scandinavia, Edel-Mega released &quot;Unspeakable&quot; as the second single; however, its poor chart performance resulted in the premature end of the album&#x27;s promotion.

=== 2003–2009: Hiatus and reunion ===
The group remained out of the spotlight throughout 2003 and 2004. During this time, Jenny performed solo live performances in several Christian shows with her husband, Jakob Petrén, and released an album as a vocalist with the Swedish group Arose.

In 2005, several songs featuring vocals by both Jenny and Linn were recorded with producer Tommy Ekman, including &quot;Would You Believe&quot; and &quot;Make My Day&quot;. Jonas and Ulf later explained that the group did not have the energy to finish the project, though the tracks that were recorded eventually surfaced. At the end of 2005, the group reunited, without Linn, for several live performances at the Night of the Proms in Belgium, alongside other artists such as Donna Summer.
Ace of Base reunited as a trio to perform their first full-length concert since 1996 in Yekaterinburg, Russia, on 15 November 2007. They embarked on a world tour called &quot;Ace of Base - Redefined!&quot;, which continued throughout 2008 and 2009. The set list included several new versions of their greatest hits. Jenny confirmed Linn&#x27;s permanent departure from the group, saying &quot;She hasn&#x27;t been part of Ace of Base for several years&quot; in &quot;Se &amp; Hør&quot; magazine. Ulf later explained in an interview &quot;She left the band and we promised her to never even ask to come back. She&#x27;s done with entertainment industry. It&#x27;s understandable. It&#x27;s brutal from the inside, it was not for her. She has no craving to be famous, she loved her fans, but the fame factor was not for her.&quot; While touring, the group performed a brand new song called &quot;Sparks From A Fire&quot;.

The group collaborated with Jenny&#x27;s husband, Jakob, to record material for a new studio album, which was intended to include seven new songs and seven remakes of old hits. However, this album did not see a release and a new compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, was released on 12 November 2008, instead. Five re-recorded songs were released from the album in various forms: &quot;Lucky Love 2009&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Around 2009&quot;, &quot;The Sign (Freedom Bunch Mix)&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune 2009&quot;, which was released worldwide on 24 October 2008, as a digital single. A fifth reworking, &quot;Happy Nation 2009&quot;, was released separately as a remix kit. A remake of &quot;All That She Wants&quot; was also recorded and featured guest vocals by Britney Spears that stemmed from her own 2007 cover of the song. This remake was never officially released, but leaked online in June 2016. Three of the new tracks recorded in this period (&quot;Sparks From A Fire&quot;, &quot;The Mask&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Mine&quot;) were posted on YouTube in 2017.

=== 2009–2012: New members, &quot;The Golden Ratio&quot;, and &quot;Ace Thursdays&quot; ===
In August 2009, in an interview with Digital Spy, Ulf mentioned adding another singer to the group alongside Jenny, explaining: &quot;We&#x27;re just deciding now whether to add a fourth member to the group again or to bring it out under a new name. At the moment, we think it would be stronger with two female singers, so it&#x27;s a little technical problem to solve.&quot; During this time, Ulf and Jonas began recording songs with singer Julia Williamson, whom they met through Martin Dodd, who had originally signed the group to Mega Records. Meanwhile, a new remix of &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; by Rico Bernasconi charted at No. 69 in Germany.

Jenny published her autobiography &quot;Vinna hela Världen&quot; in Sweden in September and announced that she was recording a solo album, which materialized in October 2010 as &quot;My Story&quot;. In November 2009, Jenny confirmed via Twitter that she would not be involved with the upcoming album, but later clarified that she had not left, saying that &quot;other constellations will have other names&quot;. In a 2010 interview with Aftonbladet, Jenny claimed &quot;They didn&#x27;t want to be with me&quot;, and that she was not allowed to participate in songwriting. Jonas and Ulf then said in an interview with Scandipop that Jenny wasn&#x27;t happy with plans to introduce a new member, and while she never formally quit the group, they felt that they had no choice but to proceed without her.

Two new singers were revealed in February 2010: Clara Hagman, a contestant from Idol 2009 who Ulf met whilst appearing as a guest judge on the show; and Julia Williamson. The new quartet maintained the original band name, but it was stylized as &quot;Ace.of.Base&quot; on the artwork of single and album releases. In July 2010, a track called &quot;Mr. Replay&quot; appeared on a Polish promo compilation for DJs, becoming the first release from the new line-up. The first official single from the line-up, &quot;All for You&quot;, was premiered on radio station Antenne AC on July 22, and was released on CD and download on September 10, debuting at No. 38 in Germany. The album &quot;The Golden Ratio&quot; followed on September 24, entering the German album charts at No. 20. In Sweden, the album failed to chart, backed only by a radio release of the album&#x27;s title track &quot;The Golden Ratio&quot; in October, followed by a performance of &quot;Southern California&quot; on Bingolotto in April 2011. An acoustic version of the album was being considered but never materialized. No further singles were released in support of the album.

In March 2011, Jonas began releasing previously unreleased material to fans via the band&#x27;s official Facebook page and the website ReverbNation on a semi-regular basis, in events they referred to as &quot;Ace Thursdays&quot;. Writing sessions for new material took place throughout the same year, but following the group&#x27;s tour of Canada and Brazil in 2011, new music was put on hold.

=== 2012–present: Departures, &quot;Hidden Gems&quot; and 30th anniversary ===
&quot;Ace Thursdays&quot; continued throughout 2012, but were discontinued in May 2013. In November 2012, Jenny was quoted as saying, &quot;The rest of the band are doing other things. ... We&#x27;re just wishing each other luck at this stage. I have a dream that we&#x27;ll get back together, so I don&#x27;t want to bang anyone on the head&quot;. Jenny began touring as &quot;Jenny from Ace of Base&quot; alongside popular Eurodance acts from the decade.

In January 2014, Julia announced that she had left the group in 2012. She later confirmed that Clara had also left, saying &quot;I never really left the group, one day I just didn&#x27;t hear anything from them and it&#x27;s the same with Clara. Like it went up in smoke; really strange&quot;. Clara has since released several solo singles, and has collaborated with various EDM producers such as KREAM and R3hab.

A remix EP was released in July 2014, featuring new remixes of &quot;All That She Wants&quot;. In December 2014 and January 2015, remastered versions of their first four studio albums, in both European and American editions, were released digitally. This was followed in March by &quot;Hidden Gems&quot;, a compilation album consisting entirely of demos and b-sides. &quot;Would You Believe&quot;, one of the last tracks recorded by the original quartet in 2005, was released as a promotional single. The band filmed a multi-part documentary titled &quot;The Story&quot; at Google Headquarters that was posted on YouTube in March 2015. It also aired on Swedish television.

In a 2015 interview with ABC News, Ulf remarked on the possibility of a future reunion, stating, &quot;With the right elements in the next few years, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible&quot;; however, in July 2016, Jenny remarked: &quot;We won&#x27;t re-form. [...] We&#x27;re finished working together but we&#x27;re not finished being family together. We have a lot of fun plans in the future but no musical plans&quot;. In 2018, Jonas said a potential reunion had been discussed, but noted &quot;We always got the same question &quot;where is Malin?&quot;. I am still writing music, maybe one song each fortnight or something. It&#x27;s a lot of fun, like therapy. And maybe if we do a reunion... I have songs for it!&quot;

In 2019, Demon Music Group began releasing new compilations of the band&#x27;s material in the United Kingdom. The first of these releases was &quot;Ace Of Base – Gold&quot;, which charted at No. 59 in the UK, marking the group&#x27;s first return to the UK charts in 20 years. To mark the group&#x27;s 30th anniversary, a 12-disc box set called &quot;All That She Wants: The Classic Collection&quot; was released in July 2020. The set includes expanded versions of the group&#x27;s original four studio albums and &quot;Hidden Gems&quot;, &quot;Hidden Gems, Vol. 2&quot; (a new follow-up to the original &quot;Hidden Gems&quot;), an EP containing previously unreleased remixes of &quot;Edge Of Heaven&quot;, and a DVD containing all of the group&#x27;s music videos. Included among the 195 tracks are previously unreleased demos from the original line-up&#x27;s final recording sessions in 2008 and live recordings of the group&#x27;s first gig at Bältespännarparken in 1990. There is also a 4 LP coloured vinyl version of the box set, which only includes the four studio albums. &quot;Hidden Gems, Vol. 2&quot; was released digitally in August 2020.

In 2020, Playground Records began releasing standalone digital singles which feature new remixes of the group&#x27;s tracks. In November 2021, a remix EP was released for the album track &quot;Dancer in a Daydream&quot; which first appeared on &quot;Happy Nation&quot; in 1992. The EP features remixes by producer Trace Adam and was released alongside a new video with previously unseen footage.

On 28 April 2023, the group released a 26-compact disc singles box set, &quot;Beautiful Life: The Singles&quot;. A three-part documentary series, &quot;All That She Wants&quot;, produced by Viaplay, was announced on 21 November 2023. The series premiered in April 2024.

The group was inducted into the Swedish Music Hall of Fame in September 2024.

== Legacy ==
Several musicians and singers have been influenced by Ace of Base. Lady Gaga has said her album &quot;The Fame Monster&quot; was influenced by the &quot;super pop melodies of the 90s&quot; by acts such as Ace of Base. The song &quot;Alejandro&quot; in particular has been heavily compared to Ace of Base&#x27;s version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Around&quot;; Paul Lester from BBC commented that &quot;[Alejandro] moves at an Ace of Base pace&quot;, and Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the song as a homage to them; The song &quot;Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)&quot; from &quot;The Fame&quot; has also been linked to the band; Alexis Petridis from &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that the song &quot;is the first song in a long time that warrants comparison to the œuvre of Ace of Base&quot;.

Katy Perry said she wanted her third studio album, &quot;Teenage Dream&quot;, to sound like &quot;The Sign&quot;. In 2010, Perry said of the album: &quot;It&#x27;s what I said I wanted earlier...We nailed it: It&#x27;s roller-skating! It&#x27;s &#x27;90s! It&#x27;s Ace of Base! It&#x27;s Cyndi Lauper! It&#x27;s like all these colors and more&quot;. Robyn said she was inspired by Ace of Base for her song &quot;Dancehall Queen&quot;, which was produced by Diplo and Klas Åhlund for her fifth studio album &quot;Body Talk Pt. 1&quot;, saying: &quot;We were just having fun with that kind of genre music. And the idea of making this song came out of that discussion. It was fun&quot;.

Some of Clean Bandit&#x27;s tracks have been compared to the band, notably their 2016 UK No. 1 single &quot;Rockabye&quot;. Band members have named them as an influence in interviews. Tegan and Sara&#x27;s song &quot;Closer&quot; was inspired by the band&#x27;s music. Robert Alfons of Canadian synthpop group Trust said he was influenced by the synthesizers used by Ace of Base. Yeasayer and Twin Shadow have both also cited Ace of Base as an influence.

In 1995, a cover of &quot;The Sign&quot; was featured in the American sitcom Full House in the final season episode &quot;We Got the Beat&quot;. In the episode, Jodie Sweetin in character as Stephanie Tanner performs the song with her fictional band Girl Talk. Indie rock band The Mountain Goats included a cover of &quot;The Sign&quot; by Ace of Base on their 1995 EP &quot;Songs For Peter Hughes&quot;. The group has continued to play versions of it at live shows. Beck had plans to cover an Ace of Base album as part of his Beck&#x27;s Record Club project in 2009, but this never came to fruition. &quot;The Sign&quot; was covered by fictional a cappella group the Barden Bellas in the 2012 film &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot; and appears on the soundtrack for the movie. The 2019 single &quot;Liar&quot; by Cuban pop singer Camila Cabello interpolates the melody of &quot;All That She Wants&quot;.

<doc id="397028" wikidata="Q2420335" url="?curid=397028" title="Omega Red">
<text>Omega Red is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most commonly in association with the X-Men. In 2009, Omega Red was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 95th-greatest comic book villain of all time.

The character made his live-action debut through a cameo appearance in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, portrayed by Dakoda Shepley.

==Publication history==

Omega Red first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #4 (vol. 2, January 1992), and was created by Jim Lee and John Byrne.

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about the past of Arkady Gregorivich Rossovich except that he was a serial killer born in Soviet Russia. He was captured by the Interpol agent Sean Cassidy and turned over to the KGB, which wanted to experiment and attempt to create a supersoldier similar to Captain America. Omega Red is the result.

In another version of Omega Red&#x27;s past, Arkady was a Soviet soldier stationed in a small Siberian town. He was a murderer, his crimes easily discoverable due to the town&#x27;s small size and limited number of potential victims. He was caught by his fellow soldiers and summarily executed via a gunshot to the back of the head. His superiors were astonished when Arkady survived the execution, and recommended him for the aforementioned Soviet super soldier project, a brutal process; it is suggested that Arkady survived solely due to his evil and cruel nature. He became an operative for Soviet intelligence and the KGB.

The Soviet government implanted a retractable carbonadium tentacle within each of Omega Red&#x27;s arms. Carbonadium was the Soviets&#x27; attempt to recreate the artificial alloy known as adamantium, as carbonadium is a more malleable form of adamantium. He uses them as weapons and as grappling appendages. He is able to wrap a victim in his coils to drain them of their &quot;life&quot; energy. This vampiric tendency is essential to Omega Red&#x27;s survival; the carbonadium implants, while great offensive weapons, slowly poisoned him and he was required to regularly drain the life energy of a person, or perhaps take small amounts from larger numbers of individuals, in order to temporarily sustain his immune system. In order to stabilize his condition, Omega Red requires the &quot;Carbonadium Synthesizer,&quot; a device that was stolen by Wolverine, Maverick, and Sabretooth during their final mission together as &quot;Team X&quot; and attempted rescue of double agent Janice Hollenbeck in the 1960s. It is because of his need for the Carbonadium Synthesizer that Omega Red has continuously sought out these three individuals over the years, believing they may know of its whereabouts. While Sabretooth and Maverick &quot;might&quot; have been aware of its location, it was eventually revealed that Wolverine actually &quot;does&quot; know where it is.

Omega Red also battled John Wraith in Berlin at that time.

At some time in the past, the Soviet government decided that Omega Red was too unpredictable and treacherous to be relied upon. As such, he needed to be put in cryogenic suspended animation until a method could be found to control him. After the fall of Communism in Russia he was revived from suspended animation by Matsu&#x27;o Tsurayaba, who led his own renegade faction of the clan of ninja known as The Hand. Omega Red became a warrior serving Matsu&#x27;o Tsurayaba and was led to believe that Wolverine knew the whereabouts of the Carbonadium Synthesizer which could save his life, and sought him out in an effort to find this device. In doing so, he came into conflict with the X-Men many times. In their first encounter in modern times, Omega Red captured Wolverine. He fought and defeated Wolverine, and brought him to Tsurayaba, Fenris, and Cornelius in Berlin. He battled the X-Men, and was wounded by Psylocke and defeated by the X-Men and Maverick but escaped. Later, Omega Red battled and fell under the mental control of the Soul Skinner in Siberia. The Soul Skinner then used him to battle Wolverine and the X-Men. Omega Red was able to subdue the team and capture Wolverine and Jubilee and was then sent to capture Colossus, who had retreated. Omega Red eluded capture by Wolverine after the Soul Skinner&#x27;s death. He later fought against Chamber of Generation X, but suffered a humiliating defeat. Ultimately, Omega Red failed to eliminate Wolverine and proved to be no more loyal to the Hand than he was to the Soviet government.

He has worked for Neocommunist organizations and tried to kill a member of the Americomp organization, but was stopped by Daredevil and Black Widow.

Omega Red was later employed by Russian gangster Ivan Pushkin to incite a war between the terrorist organization HYDRA and the technology suppliers A. I. M.

While working for the drug lord known as the General, Omega Red was recruited by Sabretooth to attack Wolverine&#x27;s friends and family alongside Lady Deathstrike. Sabretooth had promised both Omega Red and Deathstrike information on almost every mutant on Earth, but betrayed his new henchmen by teleporting away with Wolverine, his ward Amiko, and the information.

Omega Red is currently a crime lord (head of the Red Mafia) who poses as a legitimate business man, much like Wilson Fisk does in the U.S. At present, Omega Red has resumed his search for the Carbonadium Synthesizer. In &quot;Wolverine: Origins&quot; #6 and #7, Omega Red locates former Team X member, and now one of the numerous depowered mutants, Agent Zero, a.k.a. Maverick, who is the only person that knows the location of the Carbonadium Synthesizer. This brings him into direct confrontation with Wolverine, who has also sought out Maverick in hopes of locating the Carbonadium Synthesizer. The result of this encounter is that Wolverine outsmarts Omega Red, landing him in the custody of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Months later, it becomes known that the Red Room bought Omega Red&#x27;s freedom with the hopes of using him to their own ends. Wolverine, Colossus, and Nightcrawler encounter him after he has freed himself from his master, however, and they engage in combat. Omega Red is largely impervious to Wolverine&#x27;s claws; the Red Room had been experimenting on his body in an effort to enhance his healing factor. After Nightcrawler intervenes and knocks Omega Red unconscious, he is returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

Thanks to the enigmatic Romulus, Omega Red is transferred to a regular Russian prison to set a trap for Wolverine. Aided by Wild Child, their plan consisted of dropping Logan into molten steel. However, as Wild Child was preparing to finish the job, Omega Red interrupted him. While Wild Child and Omega Red battle each other, Logan managed to flee. A distracted Wild Child is consequently thrown into the molten steel by Omega Red after having his chest punctured.

Omega Red was killed after being stabbed in the heart with the Muramasa blade by Wolverine.

Omega Red later appears in Hell attempting to attack Wolverine by binding him with his tentacles, but is quickly taken down when Wolverine grabs him by the tentacles and flips him over.

The body of Arkady Rossovich was later obtained by some Russian members of the Church of St. Mitrophan who, after a mystical ceremony made by their magiks, were able to raise Omega Red back to life. However, the procedure is only temporary, as the grave will continue to call Arkady, nevertheless they reassure him that they will continue searching for a way to overcome this limitation. The limitation was eventually solved when the Russian Mafia used the abilities of X-Man Magik to restore Omega Red to his fullest strength, but he was nevertheless defeated and delivered to the custody of S.I.C.K.L.E. (the Russian version of S.H.I.E.L.D.).

Arriving bloodied and beaten at Krakoa and seeking asylum, Omega Red is met by Wolverine, who tries to persuade Magneto that Arkady is too dangerous to be allowed on the island, as he poses too serious a threat to the women and children living there. Investigating his claims of a secret vampire enclave hidden in Paris, Wolverine is captured by Vlad Dracula, who has rejuvenated himself by drinking his blood. As per their agreement, Dracula presents Omega Red with the Carbonadium Synthesizer, warning him that it now contains a detonator, whereupon Arkady will serve as a spy in the service of Vlad to aid against any interference from the mutants towards the Vampire Nation&#x27;s hidden agenda. At Wolverine&#x27;s insistence, Omega Red is restrained by Krakoa and psychically interrogated by Jean Grey, whereupon X-Force discovers that Omega Red has indeed been mesmerized by Dracula to possibly serve as a spy for the Vampire Nation in exchange for the Carbonadium Synthesizer that is implanted within his chest. While Beast discusses with Forge about creating a duplicate C-Synth containing audio surveillance and homing beacon capabilities, we learn that the detonator has exploded, killing Omega Red. Resurrection protocols will involve delayed consciousness uploading after his new body has hatched insuring he has no memory of his death or rebirth, allowing him to serve X-Force as a double agent in his future dealings with Dracula.

==Powers and abilities==
Omega Red is a mutant with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, and the ability to secrete pheromones from his body typically referred to as &quot;Death Spores&quot;. The death spores result in the weakness or death of humans in his immediate vicinity. The severity of the effect is based on the endurance, health, and relative proximity of the victims. The spores are fatal to ordinary humans within seconds, though some superhumanly powered beings can withstand exposure to them for extended periods of time.

Implanted within Omega Red&#x27;s arms are long retractable tendril-like coils made of carbonadium, an artificial alloy that is the former Soviet Union&#x27;s attempt at creating true adamantium. Carbonadium is more malleable than adamantium and, while being vastly stronger than steel, is considerably less durable than adamantium. Carbonadium, however, is for all practical purposes virtually indestructible. Omega Red can cause the coils to shoot forward from openings in the undersides of his wrists in order to ensnare his victims. Omega Red is able to use the tentacles as highly effective offensive weapons, often brandishing them like whips during combat. The natural durability of the tentacles, combined with his physical strength, are sufficient to cause damage to most conventional materials.

Omega Red also has superhuman levels of stamina sufficient to engage Wolverine in combat continuously for over eighteen hours with no signs of fatigue. His bodily tissues are harder and more resistant to certain types of injury than those of an ordinary human. While he is not invulnerable, his body can withstand great impact and blunt trauma forces that would result in severe injury or death in an ordinary human. However, his resistance to injury is considerably enhanced due to the red carbonadium armor that he wears, which has been sufficient to allow him to withstand powerful energy blasts from the likes of Chamber, and Wolverine&#x27;s claws, without sustaining injury.

Omega Red has the ability, and need, to drain the life force of victims with his pheromones in order to sustain his own. Omega Red can likewise ensnare his victims within his tentacles, and use the coils as a conduit for his lethal pheromones. Due to the mutant &quot;death factor&quot; and the presence of the carbonadium within his body, Omega Red must drain the life force of others on a regular basis in order to sustain his own physical health and remain active. Omega Red can use these absorbed energies to, temporarily, increase his body&#x27;s healing capabilities to the point where he can fully heal from a punctured lung within a few minutes. Only a device known as the Carbonadium Synthesizer can stabilize his condition, as carbonadium is the only metal that can neutralize the &quot;death factor,&quot; thereby stabilizing it within his body.

Omega Red is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and military tactician. He was trained in various forms of armed and unarmed combat by both the Soviet government and various organizations throughout the Japanese and Russian criminal underworlds. Highly intelligent, he has quickly become highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations.

* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Omega Red 17th in their &quot;Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel&#x27;s Coolest Alternate World&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; timeline, there is a different version of Omega Red known only as Rossovich. Instead of a homicidal maniac, Rossovich appeared more sane and business-like. He had ties to the mutant underground and the black market. He ended up face-to-face with Domino and Grizzly, who appeared to take his life when he couldn&#x27;t provide them with the information they needed.

After the death of Apocalypse and the ascension of Weapon X into Weapon Omega, the heir of Apocalypse, it was mentioned that Rossovich had, in fact, survived and had returned to his country where under the alias of Omega Red had built an army strong enough to overrun most of Asia and Eastern Europe with relative ease. When Weapon Omega was eventually deposed, the threat from Omega Red to the East was expected, yet the first wave never came and it never would, as Omega Red had been given the knowledge that the canister containing the Apocalypse power was now in Prophet&#x27;s possession.

===Days of Future Now===
In the &quot;Days of Future Now&quot; story, Omega Red is a member of X-Force.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Omega Red is an enemy of Spider-Man. He is depicted as a mutant with a hatred of humans. At some point, he had been hired to attack a cargo ship belonging to Roxxon Industries as a conspiracy by Tinkerer against its leader Donald Roxxon. After his fight with Spider-Man, he was arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. However, he managed to escape when the Green Goblin escaped. His defeat by Spider-Man became public knowledge because of articles written by J. Jonah Jameson detailing his humiliation. Subsequently, his former clients blacklisted him. He blamed Jameson for the loss of his livelihood. When Jameson began writing articles critical of Roxxon, Omega Red went to the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; office disguised as a janitor and ambushed Jameson in his office with the intent to do Roxxon a high-profile favor and restore his mercenary career. Unfortunately, Peter Parker happened to be in the Bugle office that day. Changing into his Spider-Man costume and bursting through Jameson&#x27;s office window, he quickly subdued Omega Red, ultimately knocking him unconscious with a vending machine. His tentacles extend from the tops of his wrists instead of the bottom and appear to be organic, not artificial. He has demonstrated superhuman strength.

He is later imprisoned in S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s Triskelion, and freed in a breakout by Electro hired by Norman Osborn along with Kraven, and Gwen Stacy/Carnage.

Several months later after the death of Spider-Man, Omega Red is seen resuming his work. He is stopped by the second Spider-Man.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker visited Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. Omega Red appears as a member of the Rasputin family. He is among the Rasputin family members that attend Maker&#x27;s event at The City in Latveria. Omega Red was with the Rasputin family when they attended a gathering following the death of Obadiah Stane. Omega Red and the Rasputin family are among the leaders that meet outside The City after it closed up with Maker, Kang the Conqueror, and Howard Stark still inside as they make plans to divide up Howard&#x27;s territory.

During a meeting with the rest of Maker&#x27;s Council and Nick Fury, it is revealed by Omega Red, Colossus, and Magik that they have any mutants sent to the Eurasian Republic where they are using them as weapons. Omega Red even makes a reference to the war that they are all used to.

In a flashback, Omega Red and the Rasputin family are told about Logan and his regenerative abilities by Dr. Alongya Prostovich as they plan to make use of a telepath in their possession to wipe his memory and get better control over him so that he can serve as their Winter Soldier.

<text>This section of the Timeline of Quebec history concerns events through 1533.

==Prehistory==
* Paleo-Amerindians, whose presence in Quebec can be traced back 10,000 years, preceded the Algonquian and Iroquoian aboriginal peoples, with whom the Europeans first made contact in the 16th century.
* Some 8,500 years ago, the south of Quebec became habitable as it grew warmer. The first peoples began to immigrate on what is today the Province of Quebec. They were the ancestors of today&#x27;s Algonquian and Iroquoian peoples.

==15th century==
*1491 Dec. 31st Jacques Cartier is born
*1492 - For the Queen of Castile (later, Spain), Christopher Columbus crosses the Atlantic Ocean. 
*1497 - John Cabot reaches the island of Newfoundland, which he claims for England.

==16th century==
*1524 - Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine in the service of the King Francis I of France explores the East coast of North America from Florida to Newfoundland as well as parts of New York Harbor. The French would take narrow land ports of the Boroughs Queens and Brooklyn from the upper and lower parts of the harbor until 1609 when the British and the Dutch take control of it from the French.
*1525 and after - Basque fishermen and whalers regularly sail in the St. Lawrence estuary and the Saguenay River.

<doc id="397040" wikidata="Q7430336" url="?curid=397040" title="Scarcity value">
<text>Scarcity value is an economic factor describing the increase in an item&#x27;s relative price by a low supply. Whereas the prices of newly manufactured products depends mostly on the &quot;cost of production&quot; (the cost of inputs used to produce them, which in turn reflects the scarcity of the inputs), the prices of many goods—such as antiques, rare stamps, and those raw materials in high demand—reflects the scarcity of the products themselves. 

In terms of partial-equilibrium supply and demand, the markets where prices are &quot;cost-determined&quot; have a supply curve that is very elastic or even horizontal, so that an increase in demand raises the quantity of production much more than the price. The price mostly reflects the scarcity of the inputs but not that of the product. On the other hand, those items with scarcity value have inelastic or even vertical supply curves, so that an increase in the demand for the product mostly increases the price and not the quantity supplied. The seller of the product receives a price higher than the cost of producing the item and so receives a significant scarcity rent or producer&#x27;s surplus when demand is high. Note that the cost of production may be close to zero, as with a rare stamp, so that the entire price consists of scarcity rent.

In a contribution by biologists Courchamp &quot;et al.&quot; (2006) it is argued that rarity value (as they call scarcity value) may sometimes contribute to the over-exploitation of wildlife or rare biological systems. Rarity leads to a high unit price of a species, hence to higher incentives to catch, which in turn increases rarity, inducing a higher price, higher incentives, and so on. An ongoing example of this kind of economic–biological feedback might be the case of the bluefin tuna.

In Mark Twain&#x27;s novel &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, he describes the titular character&#x27;s revelation regarding a key driver of activity: &quot;Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it – namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.&quot;

<doc id="397041" wikidata="Q5500230" url="?curid=397041" title="Free floating screed">
<text>The free floating screed is a device pioneered in the 1930s that revolutionized the asphalt paving process. The device is designed to spread and smooth out, or screed, the material (e.g. concrete or asphalt) below it.

== Description ==
The screed connects to the tractor portion of the paving machine via its tow arm. Paving material is transferred from the hopper at the front of the tractor to the screed, and augers spread it across the width of the screed. The material then flows out across the width of the screed at the desired depth. A screed operator stands on a platform at the center of the screed and controls the placement of the paving mixture. Adjusting screed settings will change the placement depth and width, as well as amount of material being placed. Many modern screeds can be run in an automatic mode, too.

Because the only connection between the asphalt paver and the screed is the tow arm, the screed can &quot;float&quot; vertically relative to the paver. This allows the paver to traverse uneven ground while the screed floats over the material placed in front of it.

The free floating screed has become standard because of the smoothing or averaging effect it can have on the existing base course. The free floating screed has a number of forces acting on it that, when in equilibrium, allow the depth behind the screed to be constant.
* Tow arm pull: the force exerted on the screed by the paver dragging it
* Mass: the weight of the screed
* Resistance of the head of material: the opposing force exerted on the screed by the pile of material in front of the screed. This force depends in turn on the material&#x27;s viscosity and mass.

The angle at which the tow arm pull is exerted on the screed also contributes to the motion; its resultant force is either added or subtracted from the mass of the screed.

If each of these forces is constant, altering the angle of the screed to the horizontal (angle of attack) will control the amount of material extruded behind the screed. Increasing the angle of attack will cause the screed to climb higher through the pile of material, and therefore raise its trailing edge, increasing the amount of material extruded behind the screed. Similarly, reducing the angle of attack will reduce the amount of material extruded.

== Patent ==
The free floating screed was first developed by Harry H. Barber, one of the founders of the Barber-Greene Co., in 1933 for which he received patent number three years later. Barber Green dominated the market for free floating screed equipment until the patent expired in 1955, and now all major asphalt paver manufacturers use this design principle in their equipment.

<doc id="397042" wikidata="Q982678" url="?curid=397042" title="King Sunny Adé">
<text>Chief Sunday Adeniyi Adegeye (born 22 September 1946), known professionally as King Sunny Adé, is a Nigerian jùjú singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. He is regarded as one of the first African pop musicians to gain international success and has been called one of the most influential musicians of all time.

Sunny Adé formed his backing band in 1967, eventually known as his African Beats. After achieving national success in Nigeria during the 1970s and founding his own independent label, Sunny Adé signed to Island Records in 1982 and achieved international success with the albums &quot;Juju Music&quot; (1982) and &quot;Synchro System&quot; (1983); the latter garnered him a Grammy nomination, a first for a Nigerian artist. His 1998 album &quot;Odu&quot; also garnered a Grammy nomination. Sunny Adé served as board chairman of the Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria before it got licensed and was later appointed honorary president of the society in recognition of his leadership role in the society.

==Early life==
Sunny Adé was born in Osogbo to a Nigerian royal family from Ondo and Akure, making him an Omoba of the Yoruba people. His father was a church organist, while his mother, Maria Adegeye, was a trader. As a member of the Adesida dynasty, his mother&#x27;s relatives included Oba Adesida I (who ruled Akure for 60 years).

== Career ==
Sunny Adé left grammar school in Ondo City under the pretense of going to the University of Lagos. It was thus in Lagos that his eclectic musical career began.

Sunny Adé&#x27;s musical sound has evolved from the early days. His career began with Moses Olaiya&#x27;s Federal Rhythm Dandies, a highlife band. He left to form a new band, The Green Spots, in 1967. Over the years, for various reasons ranging from changes in his music to ba usiness concerns, Sunny Adé&#x27;s band changed its name several times, first to African Beats and then to Golden Mercury.

King Sunny Ade was influenced by Juju pioneer Tunde Nightingale and borrowed stylistic elements from his ‘So wa mbe’ style of juju.

He founded the King Sunny Ade Foundation, an organization that includes a performing arts center, a state-of-the-art recording studio, and housing for young musicians.

He is a visiting lecturer at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, and a recipient of the Order of the Federal Republic. He is the first Nigerian ever to be nominated for the Grammys.

==Stage performances==
After over a decade of resounding success in his native Nigeria, Sunny Adé received great acclaim in Europe and North America in 1982. The global release of &quot;Juju Music&quot; and its accompanying tour was &quot;almost unanimously embraced by critics (if not consumers) everywhere&quot;. Sunny Adé was described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s great band leaders&quot;, in &quot;Record&quot; as &quot;a breath of fresh air, a positive vibration we will feel for some time to come&quot; and in &quot;Trouser Press&quot; as &quot;one of the most captivating and important musical artists anywhere in the world&quot;. Sunny Adé‘s stage show was characterized by top musicianship, highlighted by his guitar mastery, and dexterous dancing. The live performances were also usually significantly longer than the two hours or less that had become the norm for concerts in North America and Europe.

His next album, &quot;Syncro System&quot; (1983), was equally successful, earned him his first Grammy Award nomination in the ethnic/traditional folk recording category, hence making him the first Nigerian Grammy award nominee ever

On 16 July 2017, King Sunny Ade announced that he would be returning to the stage in London alongside his rival act Ebenezer Obey for a musical comeback themed A Night 2 Remember with the Legends 

In 2017, he was appointed ambassador for the &quot;Change Begins With Me&quot; campaign by the Nigerian Minister of Information Lai Mohammed.

==A fusion of sounds==
Sunny Adé&#x27;s music is characterized by, among other instruments, the talking drum – an instrument indigenous to his Yoruba roots, the guitar and his peculiar application to jùjú music. His music is in the age-old tradition of singing poetic lyrics (&quot;ewi&quot; in Yoruba) and praise singing of dignitaries as well as components of Juju (traditional African belief) called the &quot;Ogede&quot; (casting of spells). Hence, Sunny Adé&#x27;s music constitutes a record of the oral tradition of his people for posterity.

Sunny Adé introduced the pedal steel guitar to Nigerian pop music. He introduced the use of synthesizers, clarinet, vibraphone, tenor guitar into the jùjú music repertoire such as dub and wah-wah guitar licks. Sunny Adé said he used these instruments not as an attempt to innovate, but as a substitute for traditional jùjú instruments which were too difficult to find and/or impractical for touring. The pedal steel guitar, for instance, was added to his repertoire as a sound-alike for an African violin.

Sunny Adé with his band invented his unique sound and instrumental which he mostly uses as an entrance song during live performances. The sound was made with a phalanx of electric guitars that functions like a percussion section and talking drums that sound like a gossipy Greek chorus.

==Island Records==
After the death of Bob Marley, Island Records began looking for another third world artist to put on its contract, while Fela Kuti had just been signed by Arista Records. Producer Martin Meissonnier introduced King Sunny Adé to Chris Blackwell, leading to the release of &quot;Juju Music&quot; in 1982. Robert Palmer claims to have brought King Sunny Adé to Island&#x27;s attention, his familiarity being from his life on Malta in the 1960s listening to African Radio and Armed Forces Radio. Sunny Adé gained a wide following with this album and was soon billed as &quot;the African Bob Marley&quot;.

King Sunny Ade parted ways with Island records after the production of 1983&#x27;s &quot;Synchro System&quot; and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Aura&quot;.

==Collaborations==
Sunny Ade has collaborated with major artists such as Manu Dibango (&quot;Wakafrika&quot;) and Stevie Wonder (who played harmonica on &quot;Aura&quot;), as well as younger Nigerian artists such as Wasiu Alabi Pasuma and Bola Abimbola.

Sunny Adé&#x27;s brief period of recordings with Island Records opened the floodgates for other world music artists like Senegalese Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Mali&#x27;s Salif Keita, and many others.

==Later career==
===1987 comeback===
In 1987, Sunny Adé returned to the international spotlight when Rykodisc released a recording of a live concert he did in Seattle.

He soon employed an American manager, Andrew Frankel, who negotiated another three-album record deal with the Mesa record label (a division of Paradise Group) in America. One of these albums was 1988&#x27;s &quot;Odu&quot;, a collection of traditional Yoruba songs, for which he was nominated for the second Grammy Award and thus making him the first African to be nominated twice for a Grammy. Apart from being an international musician Sunny Adé is also prominent in his native Nigeria, running multiple companies in several industries, creating a non-profit organisation called the King Sunny Adé Foundation, and working with the Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria.

In recent times, hip-hop music appears to be holding sway with the electronic media in Nigeria with massive airplay. Nonetheless, Sunny Adé&#x27;s musical output has continued to inspire a vast generation of other Nigerian musicians, who believe in the big band musical set up which Sunny Adé and late Fela Kuti are noted for. The musician Lagbaja is one of the many musicians whom Sunny Adé&#x27;s music has inspired. In 2008, his contributions to world music were recognized, as he was given an award for his outstanding contribution to world music at the International Reggae and World Music Awards held at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York.

===2009 comeback===
At the beginning of another round of tours in the United States and Canada, Sunny Adé, now known as The Chairman in his home country, was appointed a visiting professor of music at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife. In July of that same year, King Sunny Adé was inducted into the Afropop Hall of Fame, at the Brooklyn African Festival in the United States. He dedicated the award to Michael Jackson.

==Acting career==
In the 1980s, Sunny Adé did some work in Hollywood. His music was featured in the 1983 film &quot;Breathless&quot;, starring Richard Gere, and the 1986 comedy &quot;One More Saturday Night&quot;, and he acted in Robert Altman&#x27;s 1987 comedy &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot;. He featured in a few Nollywood movies in the early 2000s.

==Awards==
Sunny Adé has received numerous awards during his career. In November 2016 he became a recipient of the AFRIMA award. In December 2016 he was inducted into Hard Rock Cafe hall of fame.
 He was inducted into The Headies Hall of Fame at The Headies 2020 in February 2021.

<text>Anastasio Somoza García (1 February 1896 – 29 September 1956) was the leader of Nicaragua from 1936 until his assassination in 1956. He was officially the 21st President of Nicaragua from 1 January 1937 to 1 May 1947 and from 21 May 1950 until his assassination on 29 September 1956, ruling for the rest of the time as an unelected military dictator. He was the patriarch of the Somoza family, which ruled Nicaragua as a family dictatorship for 42 years.

The son of a wealthy coffee planter, Somoza was educated in the United States. After his return to Nicaragua, he helped oust President Adolfo Díaz. He became the foreign secretary and took the title of &quot;General&quot;. With the help of the US Marine Corps, which occupied Nicaragua at the time, Somoza became the head of the National Guard. This gave him the power base to remove his wife&#x27;s uncle, Juan Bautista Sacasa, from the presidency, and make himself president in 1937. In 1947, an ally nominally succeeded him, but he retained power.

A month after his successor had been inaugurated, Somoza used the military to carry out a coup. The president was declared &#x27;incapacitated&#x27; by Congress and Somoza served in his stead. Returning to power in his own name in 1950, he maintained an iron grip on his own Liberal Party while making a deal with the Conservatives; thus, he faced no opposition. This left him free to amass a huge personal fortune. On 21 September 1956, he was shot by poet Rigoberto López Pérez. Mortally wounded, he was flown to the Panama Canal Zone where he died a week later. His eldest son Luis Somoza Debayle, who was Speaker of the House at the time of Somoza Garcia&#x27;s death, took over as acting president and was elected in his own right in 1957. He served as president until 1963, and as the power behind puppet presidents until his death in 1967. Somoza García&#x27;s youngest son, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, was elected to serve until 1972, then served as the real power behind a nominally bipartisan junta until being reelected in 1974. Somoza Debayle was forced to resign in 1979 and was assassinated in exile in Paraguay the following year.

==Biography==

Somoza was born in San Marcos, Carazo Department in Nicaragua, the son of Anastasio Somoza Reyes, a wealthy criollo coffee planter, and Julia García, and a grandson of Anastasio Somoza Martínez and Isabel Reyes. As a teenager, he was sent to live with relatives in Philadelphia, where he attended the Peirce School of Business Administration (now Peirce College). During his time in Philadelphia, he learned how to speak English fluently. While living in Philadelphia, he met his future wife, Salvadora Debayle Sacasa, a member of one of Nicaragua&#x27;s wealthiest families, daughter of Dr. Luis Henri Debayle Pallais and wife Casimira Sacasa Sacasa, daughter of Roberto Sacasa Sarria, 44th and 46th President of Nicaragua, and wife and cousin Ángela Sacasa Cuadra. After returning to Nicaragua, he was unsuccessful as a businessman.

===Marriage and family===

He married Salvadora Debayle in 1919. They had two sons, Luis Somoza Debayle and Anastasio Somoza Debayle, and a daughter, Lillian Somoza de Sevilla Sacasa.

===Early political career===
In 1926, Somoza joined the Liberal rebellion in support of the presidential claims of Juan Bautista Sacasa, his wife&#x27;s uncle. Somoza failed to distinguish himself in battle, leading an unsuccessful attack on the garrison at San Marcos. However, as a result of being educated in the United States, he spoke excellent English and acted as an interpreter during the U.S.-brokered negotiations between the warring parties.

In the government of President José María Moncada, to whom he was distantly related, he served as governor of the department of León, Nicaraguan Consul to Costa Rica, and Foreign Minister. Despite his limited military experience, Somoza was able to rise through the ranks of the National Guard (), the constabulary force organized by the United States Marines.

===Somoza and Sandino===
After waging a bitter, six-year struggle with the forces of General Augusto César Sandino, in January 1933, the Marines evacuated the country following the election of Juan Bautista Sacasa as president. At the urging of the U.S. Ambassador Matthew E. Hanna, Somoza García was appointed as director of the National Guard.

During peace talks, Somoza ordered the assassination of General Sandino on 21 February 1934 in violation of a safe-conduct agreement. Sandino&#x27;s assassination was followed by the murder of former Sandino supporters by the National Guard.

===Ruler of Nicaragua===

====Somoza&#x27;s control of the Government====
In 1936, Somoza staged a coup with the National Guard, forcing Sacasa to resign in June. Carlos Alberto Brenes ruled for the remainder of the year and in December, Somoza was elected president reportedly with 64,000 of the 80,663 votes cast He took office on New Year&#x27;s Day 1937. In May 1939, President Roosevelt honored Somoza and his wife Salvadora by welcoming them to Washington, DC for a State visit. Somoza, popularly known as &quot;Tacho&quot;, amended the Constitution to centralize all power in his hands. Family members and key supporters monopolized key positions in the government and military.

====Nicaragua during World War II====
During World War II, the government confiscated the properties of Nicaragua&#x27;s small, but economically influential German community and sold them to Somoza and his family at vastly lowered prices. By 1944, Somoza was the largest landowner in Nicaragua, owning fifty-one cattle ranches and forty-six coffee plantations, as well as several sugar mills and rum distilleries. Somoza named himself director of the Pacific Railroad, linking Managua to the nation&#x27;s principal port, Corinto, which moved his merchandise and crops for free and maintained his vehicles and agricultural equipment.

He also made substantial profits by granting concessions to foreign (primarily U.S.) companies to exploit gold, rubber, and timber, for which he received &#x27;executive levies&#x27; and &#x27;presidential commissions.&#x27; He passed laws restricting imports and organized contraband operations, which sold merchandise through his own stores. He also extracted bribes from illegal gambling, prostitution, and alcohol distilling. By the end of the decade, he had acquired a fortune estimated to be US$400 million.

Though Nicaragua received Lend-Lease aid in World War II, the unwillingness of Nicaragua to actually fight meant it was given obsolete equipment (most of it being either purchased from Russia, Spain and Portugal or captured German equipment) and no Western training.

====Democratic Window====
In 1944, under pressure from the U.S., Somoza agreed to liberalize his rule. Unions were legalized, and he agreed not to run for re-election in 1947. The Nationalist Liberal Party nominated an elderly doctor named Leonardo Argüello, with Somoza using the National Guard to secure his election. Somoza intended for Argüello to be a mere puppet and to keep real power in his own hands until he could run again in 1952. However, upon being sworn in as president in May 1947, Argüello displayed considerable independence, attempting to reduce the power of the National Guard and the control of Somoza and his associates over the economy. Less than a month later, Somoza orchestrated another coup, naming one of his wife&#x27;s uncles, Benjamín Lacayo, as president. This definitively ended any hopes for further democratization in Nicaragua under the Somoza regime.

====Second Presidency====
When the administration of U.S. President Harry Truman refused to recognize the new government, a Constituent Assembly was convened, which appointed Somoza&#x27;s uncle, Víctor Manuel Román y Reyes, as president. In another heavily rigged election, Somoza García again became president in 1950. In the 1950s, he reorganized and streamlined his business empire, founding a merchant marine company, several textile mills, a national airline (LANICA, short for Líneas Aéreas de Nicaragua) and a new container port on the Pacific near Managua, which he named Puerto Somoza. (After the Sandinistas came to power they renamed it Puerto Sandino). He also acquired properties in the United States and Canada.

===Assassination and legacy===
In 1955, the constitution was amended to allow Somoza to run for another term. Shortly after being nominated, he was shot on 21 September 1956 by the poet Rigoberto López Pérez in the city of León, and died several days later in a Panama Canal Zone hospital.

Somoza&#x27;s sons, Luis and Anastasio Somoza Debayle, ruled the country directly or through figurehead politicians for the next 23 years. Despite widespread corruption and repression of dissent, they were able to receive support from the United States, which viewed them as anti-communist stalwarts and a source of stability. His daughter Lillian Somoza Debayle, born in León, Nicaragua, on 3 May 1921, married Guillermo Sevilla Sacasa, Nicaraguan Ambassador to the United States during his brother-in-law&#x27;s rule. He also had a son named José R. Somoza, born to an unknown mother.

Somoza is entombed with his oldest son Luis at Cementerio Occidental in the National Guard Mausoleum in Managua, Nicaragua. He should not be confused with his younger son Anastasio, also a former Nicaraguan dictator, who is entombed in Miami.

====&quot;Our Son of a Bitch&quot;====
Although Somoza was recognized as a ruthless dictator, the United States continued to support his regime as a non-communist stronghold in Nicaragua. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) supposedly remarked in 1939 that &quot;Somoza may be a son of a bitch, but he&#x27;s &quot;our&quot; son of a bitch.&quot; According to historian David Schmitz, however, researchers and archivists who have searched the archives of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library have found no evidence that Roosevelt ever made this statement. The statement first appeared in the 15 November 1948 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and was later mentioned in a 17 March 1960 broadcast of &quot;CBS Reports&quot; called &quot;Trujillo: Portrait of a Dictator&quot;. In this broadcast, however, it was asserted that FDR made the statement in reference to Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. It should be further noted that this statement has been attributed to a variety of United States presidential administrations in regard to foreign dictators. Thus the statement remains apocryphal at this point, though Roosevelt and later presidents certainly supported the Somoza family and their rule over Nicaragua. Andrew Crawley claims that the Roosevelt statement is a myth created by Somoza himself.
