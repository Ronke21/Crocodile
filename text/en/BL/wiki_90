<text>The Music of Wales (Welsh: &quot;Cerddoriaeth Cymru&quot;), particularly singing, is a significant part of Welsh national identity, and the country is traditionally referred to as &quot;the land of song&quot;.

This is a modern stereotype based on 19th century conceptions of Nonconformist choral music and 20th century male voice choirs, Eisteddfodau and arena singing, such as sporting events, but Wales has a history of music that has been used as a primary form of communication.

Historically, Wales has been associated with folk music, choral performance, religious music and brass bands. However modern Welsh music is a thriving scene of rock, Welsh language lyricism, modern folk, jazz, pop, and electronic music. Particularly noted in the UK are the Newport rock scene, once labelled &#x27;the new Seattle&#x27;, and the Cardiff music scene, for which the city has been labelled &#x27;Music City&#x27;, for having the second highest number of independent music venues in the UK.

==History==

===Early song===

Wales has a history of folk music related to the Celtic music of countries such as Ireland and Scotland. It has distinctive instrumentation and song types, and is often heard at a &quot;twmpath&quot; (folk dance session), &quot;gŵyl werin&quot; (folk festival) or &quot;noson lawen&quot; (a traditional party similar to the Gaelic &quot;Céilidh&quot;). Modern Welsh folk musicians have sometimes reconstructed traditions which had been suppressed or forgotten, and have competed with imported and indigenous rock and pop trends.

Wales has a history of using music as a primary form of communication. Harmony and part singing is synonymous with Welsh music. Examples of well-developed, vertical harmony can be found in the &quot;Robert ap Huw Manuscript&quot; dating back to the 1600s. This text contains pieces of Welsh music from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that show amazing harmonic development. 

The oldest known traditional songs from Wales are those connected to seasonal customs such as the Mari Lwyd or Hunting the Wren, in which both ceremonies contain processional songs where repetition is a musical feature. Other such ceremonial or feasting traditions connected with song are the New Year&#x27;s Day Calennig and the welcoming of Spring Candlemas in which the traditional wassail was followed by dancing and feast songs. Children would sing &#x27;pancake songs&#x27; on Shrove Tuesday and summer carols were connected to the festival of Calan Mai.

For many years, Welsh folk music had been suppressed, due to the effects of the Act of Union, which promoted the English language, and the rise of the Methodist church in the 18th and 19th century. The church frowned on traditional music and dance, though folk tunes were sometimes used in hymns. Since at least the 12th century, Welsh bards and musicians have participated in musical and poetic contests called eisteddfodau; this is the equivalent of the Scottish Mod and the Irish Fleadh Cheoil.

===18th and 19th century, religious music===

Music in Wales is often connected with male voice choirs, such as the Morriston Orpheus Choir, Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir and Treorchy Male Voice Choir, and enjoys a worldwide reputation in this field. This tradition of choral singing has been expressed through sporting events, especially in the country&#x27;s national sport of rugby, which in 1905 saw the first singing of a national anthem, Wales&#x27;s &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;, at the start of an international sporting encounter.

Welsh traditional music declined with the rise of Nonconformist religion in the 18th century, which emphasized choral singing over instruments, and religious over secular uses of music; traditional musical styles became associated with drunkenness and immorality. The development of hymn singing in Wales is closely tied with the Welsh Methodist revival of the late 18th century. The hymns were popularised by writers such as William Williams, while others were set to popular secular tunes or adopted Welsh ballad tunes. The appointment of Henry Mills as a musical overseer to the Welsh Methodist congregations in the 1780s saw a drive to improve singing throughout Wales. This saw the formation of local musical societies and in the first half of the 19th century Musical primers and collections of tunes were printed and distributed. Congregational singing was given further impetus with the arrival of the temperance movement, which saw the Temperance Choral Union (formed in 1854) organising annual singing festivals, these included hymn singing by combined choirs. The publication of &quot;Llyfr Tonau Cynulleidfaol&quot; by John Roberts in 1859 provided congregations with a body of standard tunes that were less complex with unadorned harmonies. This collection began the practice of combining together to sing tunes from the book laid the foundation for the Cymanfa Ganu (the hymn singing festival). Around the same period, the growing availability of music in the tonic sol-fa notation, promoted by the likes of Eleazar Roberts, allowed congregations to read music more fluently. One particularly popular hymn of this period was &quot;Llef&quot;.

In the 1860s, a revival of traditional Welsh music began, with the formation of the National Eisteddfod Society, followed by the foundation of London-area Welsh Societies and the publication of Nicholas Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Alawon fy Ngwlad&quot; (&quot;Tunes of my Land&quot;), a compilation of traditional tunes, in the 1890s.

===19th–20th century, secular music===

A tradition of brass bands dating from the Victorian era continues, particularly in the South Wales Valleys, with Welsh bands such as the Cory Band being one of the most successful in the world.
Although choral music in the 19th century by Welsh composers was mainly religious, there was a steady body of secular songs being produced. Composers such as Joseph Parry, whose work Myfanwy is still a favourite Welsh song, were followed by David Jenkins and D. Emlyn Evans, who tailored songs specifically for the Victorian music market. These secular hymns were embraced by the emerging male voice choirs, which formed originally as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, but also sang outside the church in a form of recreation and fellowship. The industrial workforce attracted less of a jollity of English glee clubs and also avoided the more robust militaristic style of music. Composers such as Charles Gounod were imitated by Welsh contemporaries such as Parry, Protheroe and Price to cater for a Welsh fondness of dramatic narratives, wide dynamic contrasts and thrilling climaxes. As well as the growth of male voice choirs during the industrial period, Wales also experienced an increase in the popularity of brass bands. The bands were popular among the working classes, and were adopted by paternalistic employers who saw brass bands as a constructive activity for their work forces. Solo artists of note during the nineteenth century included charismatic singers Robert Rees (Eos Morlais) and Sarah Edith Wynne, who would tour outside Wales and helped build the country&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;land of song&quot;.

In the twentieth century, Wales produced a large number of classical and operatic soloists of international reputation, including Ben Davies, Geraint Evans, Robert Tear, Bryn Terfel, Gwyneth Jones, Stuart Burrows, Ryland Davies, Gwynne Howell, Dennis O&#x27;Neill, Margaret Price, Rebecca Evans and Helen Watts, as well as composers such as Alun Hoddinott, William Mathias, Grace Williams and Karl Jenkins. From the 1980s onwards, crossover artists such as Katherine Jenkins, Charlotte Church and Aled Jones began to come to the fore. Welsh National Opera, established in 1946, and the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition, launched in 1983, attracted attention to Wales&#x27;s growing reputation as a centre of excellence in the classical genre.

Composer and conductor Mansel Thomas OBE (1909–1986), who worked mainly in South Wales, was one of the most influential musicians of his generation. For many years employed by the BBC, he promoted the careers of many composers and performers. He himself wrote vocal, choral, instrumental, band and orchestral music, specialising in setting songs and poetry. Many of his orchestral and chamber music pieces are based on Welsh folk songs and dances.

=== Post-1945, popular music ===
After World War II, two significant musical organisations were founded, the Welsh National Opera and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, both were factors in Welsh composers moving away from choral compositions to instrumental and orchestral pieces. Modern Welsh composers such as Alun Hoddinott and William Mathias produced large scale orchestrations, though both have returned to religious themes within their work. Both men would also explore Welsh culture, with Mathias setting music to the works of Dylan Thomas, while Hoddinott, along with the likes of Mervyn Burtch and David Wynne, would be influenced by the poetic and mythical past of Wales.

The 20th century saw many solo singers from Wales become not only national but international stars. Ivor Novello, who was a singer-songwriter during the First World War. Also, opera-singers such as Geraint Evans and later Delme Bryn-Jones found fame post World War II. The 1960s saw the rise of two distinctive Welsh acts, Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey, both of whom defined Welsh vocal styles for several generations.The 1960s saw important developments in both Welsh and English language music in Wales. The BBC had already produced Welsh language Radio programmes, such as Noson Lowen in the 1940s, and in the 1960s the corporation followed suite with television shows &quot;Hob y Deri Dando&quot; and &quot;Disc a Dawn&quot; giving Welsh acts a weekly stage to promote their sound. A more homely programme &quot;Gwlad y Gan&quot; was produced by rival channel TWW which set classic Welsh songs in idyllic settings and starred baritone Ivor Emmanuel. The Anglo-American cultural influence was a strong draw on young musicians, with Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey becoming world-famous singers; and the growth of The Beatles&#x27; Apple Records label saw Welsh acts Mary Hopkin and Badfinger join the roster. Not to be outdone, the short lived Y Blew, born out of Aberystwyth University, became the first Welsh language pop band in 1967. This was followed in 1969 with the establishment of the Sain record label, one of the most important catalyst for change in the Welsh language music scene.

In more modern times there has been a thriving musical scene. Bands and artists which have gained popularity include acts such as Man, Budgie, and solo artists John Cale &amp; Mary Hopkin in the early 1970s and solo artists Bonnie Tyler and Shakin&#x27; Stevens in the 1980s, but through mimicking American music styles such as Motown or Rock and Roll. The Welsh language scene saw a dip in commercial popularity, but a rise in experimentation with acts such as punk band Trwynau Coch leading into a &#x27;New Wave&#x27; of music. Bands that followed, like Anhrefn and Datblygu, found support from BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, one of the few DJs outside Wales to champion Welsh language music.

Wales embraced the new music of the 1980s and 1990s, particularly with the thriving Newport rock scene for which the city was labelled &#x27;the new Seattle&#x27;. Acts and individuals based in the city during the period included Joe Strummer of The Clash, Feeder, The Darling Buds, Donna Matthews of Elastica, as well as Skindred and punk and metal acts. Famous performers or attendees at venues such as TJ&#x27;s included Oasis, Kurt Cobain, and others.

=== 21st century ===
The early 21st century produced a credible Welsh &#x27;sound&#x27; embraced by the public and the media press of Great Britain. Such acts included the Manic Street Preachers, Stereophonics, Catatonia, Super Furry Animals and Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci. The first two allowed the Welsh pop scene to flourish, and while not singing in Welsh they brought a sense of Welshness through iconography, lyrics and interviews. The latter two bands were notable for bringing Welsh language songs to a British audience. Music venues and acts thrived in the 2010s, with the noted success of the Cardiff music scene, for which the city has been labelled &#x27;Music City&#x27;.

== Styles of Welsh music ==

===Traditional folk music===

Early musical traditions during the 17th and 18th century saw the emergence of more complex carols, away from the repetitive ceremonial songs. These carols featured complex poetry based on cynghanedd, some were sung to English tunes, but many used Welsh melodies such as &#x27;Ffarwel Ned Puw&#x27;. The most common Welsh folk song is the love song, with lyrics pertaining to the sorrow of parting or in praise of the girl. A few employ sexual metaphor and mention the act of bundling. After love songs, the ballad was a very popular form of song, with its tales of manual labour, agriculture and the everyday life. Popular themes in the 19th century included murder, emigration and colliery disasters; sung to popular melodies from Ireland or North America.

The instrument most commonly associated with Wales is the harp, which is generally considered to be the country&#x27;s national instrument. Though it originated in Italy, the triple harp (&quot;telyn deires&quot;, &quot;three-row harp&quot;) is held up as the traditional harp of Wales: it has three rows of strings, with every semitone separately represented, while modern concert harps use a pedal system to change key by stopping the relevant strings. After losing ground to the pedal harp in the 19th century, it has been re-popularised through the efforts of Nansi Richards, Llio Rhydderch and Robin Huw Bowen. The penillion is a traditional form of Welsh singing poetry, accompanied by the harp, in which the singer and harpist follow different melodies so the stressed syllables of the poem coincide with accented beats of the harp melody.

The earliest written records of the Welsh harpists&#x27; repertoire are contained in the Robert ap Huw manuscript, which documents 30 ancient harp pieces that make up a fragment of the lost repertoire of the medieval Welsh bards. The music was composed between the 14th and 16th centuries, transmitted orally, then written down in a unique tablature and later copied in the early 17th century. This manuscript contains the earliest body of harp music from anywhere in Europe and is one of the key sources of early Welsh music. The manuscript has been the source of a long-running effort to accurately decipher the music it encodes.

Another distinctive instrument is the crwth, also a stringed instrument of a type once widespread in northern Europe, it was played in Wales from the Middle Ages, which, superseded by the fiddle (Welsh &quot;Ffidil&quot;), lingered on later in Wales than elsewhere but died out by the nineteenth century at the latest. The fiddle is an integral part of Welsh folk music. Other traditional instruments from Wales include the Welsh Bagpipes and Pibgorn.

===Folk music===
Welsh folk is known for a variety of instrumental and vocal styles, as well as more recent singer-songwriters drawing on folk traditions.

By the late 1970s, Wales, like its neighbours, had seen the beginning of a roots revival, the beginnings of which can be traced back to the 1960s folk singer-songwriter Dafydd Iwan. Iwan was instrumental in the creation of a modern Welsh folk scene, and is known for fiercely patriotic and nationalistic songs, as well as the foundation of the Sain record label. The Festival Interceltique de Lorient saw the formation of Ar Log, who spearheaded a revival of Welsh fiddling and harp-playing, and continued recording into the 21st century. A Welsh session band, following in the footsteps of their Irish counterparts Planxty, Cilmeri recorded two albums with a uniquely Welsh feel. Welsh folk rock includes a number of bands, such as Moniars, Gwerinos, The Bluehorses, Bob Delyn a&#x27;r Ebillion and Taran.

Sain was founded in 1969 by Dafydd Iwan and Huw Jones with the aid of funding from Brian Morgan Edwards. Originally, the label signed Welsh singers, mostly with overtly political lyrics, eventually branching out into a myriad of different styles. These included country music (John ac Alun), singer-songwriters (Meic Stevens), stadium rock (The Alarm) and classical singers (Aled Jones, Bryn Terfel).

The folk revival picked up energy in the 1980s with Robin Huw Bowen and other musicians achieving great commercial and critical success. Later into the 1990s, a new wave of bands including Fernhill, Rag Foundation, Bob Delyn A&#x27;r Ebillion, Moniars, Carreg Lafar, Jac y Do, Boys From The Hill and Gwerinos found popularity. Jac y Do is one of several bands that now perform &quot;twmpathau&quot; all over the country for social gatherings and public events. Welsh traditional music was updated by punk-folk bands delivering traditional tunes at a much increased tempo; these included early Bob Delyn a&#x27;r Ebillion and Defaid. The 1990s also saw the creation of Fflach:tradd, a label which soon came to dominate the Welsh folk record industry with a series of compilations, as well as thematic projects like &quot;Ffidil&quot;, which featured 13 fiddlers. Some Welsh performers have mixed traditional influences, especially the language, into imported genres, Soliloquise for example and especially John ac Alun, a Welsh language country duo who are perhaps the best-known contemporary performers in Welsh.

In June 2007, Tŷ Siamas was opened in Dolgellau. Tŷ Siamas is the National Centre for Traditional Music, with regular sessions, concerts, lessons, an interactive exhibition and a recording studio.

===Pop and rock===

In the non-traditional arena, many Welsh musicians have been present in popular rock and pop, either as individuals, (e.g. Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey, Bonnie Tyler, Dave Edmunds, Shakin&#x27; Stevens), individuals in groups (e.g. John Cale of The Velvet Underground, Green Gartside of Scritti Politti, Julian Cope of Teardrop Explodes and Andy Scott of Sweet, Roger Glover of Deep Purple and Rainbow), or as bands formed in Wales (e.g. Amen Corner, The Alarm, Man, Budgie, Badfinger, Tigertailz, Young Marble Giants), but not until the 1990s did Welsh bands begin to be seen as a particular grouping. Following on from an underground post-punk movement in the 1980s, led by bands like Datblygu and Fflaps, the 1990s saw a considerable flowering of Welsh rock groups (in both Welsh and English languages) such as Catatonia, Manic Street Preachers, Feeder, Stereophonics, Super Furry Animals, The Pooh Sticks, 60ft Dolls and Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci.

The 21st century has seen the emergence of a number of new artists, including Marina and the Diamonds, Skindred, Lostprophets, James Kennedy (musician), Kids in Glass Houses, Duffy, Christopher Rees, Bullet for My Valentine, The Automatic, Goldie Lookin Chain, People in Planes, Los Campesinos!, The Victorian English Gentlemens Club, Attack! Attack!, Gwenno, Kelly Lee Owens, Funeral for a Friend, Hondo Maclean, Fflur Dafydd, The Blackout, The Broken Vinyl Club, The Joy Formidable and The Anchoress. More abrasive alternative acts such as Jarcrew, Mclusky and Future of the Left – all well known within the independent music community and known as Welsh acts – have also received modest commercial success in the UK. Quite a strong neo-progressive/classic rock scene has developed from Swansea-based band Karnataka and other bands that have links to them. These include Magenta, The Reasoning and Panic Room.

==== Electronic music ====
Llwybr Llaethog has produced bilingual electronic music. DJ Sasha is from Hawarden, Flintshire. Also worth noting are the successful Drum and Bass DJ High Contrast who is from Cardiff, the veteran house outfit K-Klass from Wrexham, and the Swansea-based progressive breaks producers Hybrid. Escape into the Park and Bionic Events are examples of the Welsh Hard Dance scene. On 16 July 2011 Sian Evans of trip hop, synthpop Bristol based band Kosheen had a No.1 Official UK Singles Charts hit in collaboration with DJ Fresh.

=== Hip-hop ===
Welsh hip-hop and rap artists include Goldie Lookin Chain, LEMFRECK and Astroid Boys. Bilingual artists include Mr Phormula and more recently, Sage Todz, Dom James and Lloyd.

===Welsh language popular music===
There is a thriving Welsh-language contemporary music scene ranging from rock to hip-hop which routinely attracts large crowds and audiences, but they tend to be covered only by the Welsh-language media.

In 2013 the first Welsh Language Music Day was held, taking place each year in February. Events mark the use of Welsh language in a wide range of genres of music, and locations include Womanby Street in Cardiff as well as London, Swansea, Brooklyn and even Budapest.

Every year, &quot;Mentrau Iaith Cymru&quot;, The National Eisteddfod and BBC Radio Cymru have their national &#x27;Battle of the Bands,&#x27; where young, upcoming Welsh bands can compete for £1000, and, what is thought to be one of the greatest possible achievements for a Welsh language act, to perform at Maes B, on its final night. In addition to Maes B, there are a number of various Welsh language music events throughout the year that have gained popularity in the past few years. In February each year the Welsh magazine &#x27;Y Selar&#x27; hosts an award ceremony in Aberystwyth University where Welsh music fans from all over the country go to see the most popular and upcoming bands perform. There&#x27;s also the &#x27;Dawns Rhyngolegol&#x27; where the Welsh societies from every University in the UK gather to celebrate the best Welsh language music in Wales.

== Current outlets ==
Welsh bands have the outlet for audiences, on such media as BBC Wales, BBC Cymru, S4C and The Pop Factory. In particular, BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Bethan and Huw and BBC Radio Wales&#x27;s Adam Walton support new Welsh music at their respective stations.

<text>The following is a list of political parties in Monaco. Traditionally Monaco is a one party dominant state with the National and Democratic Union (now, Rally &amp; Issues) in power. Opposition parties were widely considered nonexistent. However, following the 2003 parliamentary election, the Union for Monaco (now Union Monegasque), a coalition of two parties, won 21 of the 24 seats in the National Council. Following the 2013 parliamentary election, however, Horizon Monaco, a coalition of, Rally &amp; Issues, Synergie Monegasque and Union for the Principality, held the majority of parliamentary seats. Since 2016 a majority of the former ruling coalition have defected from the Horizon Monaco coalition and formed the New Majority coalition in partnership with Renaissance and this coalition now controls the National Council under the leadership of Christophe Steiner.

Nicknamed &quot;The Power&quot;, he dominated darts across three decades and is widely considered the greatest darts player of all time, having won 214 professional tournaments, including a record 85 major titles and a record 16 World Championships. In 2015, the BBC rated Taylor among the ten greatest British sportsmen of the last 35 years.

Taylor took up darts seriously in his mid-twenties and was sponsored and mentored in his early professional career by five-time world champion Eric Bristow. An unseeded 125/1 outsider at the 1990 BDO World Darts Championship, he defeated Bristow 6–1 in the final to win his first world title at age 29. In 1992, he won his second world title in dramatic fashion, defeating Mike Gregory 6–5 in a tiebreak leg after Gregory had missed six championship darts. In 1993, Taylor was among 16 top players who broke away from the British Darts Organisation (BDO) to form the World Darts Council, later renamed the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). He won eight consecutive World Championships from 1995 to 2002, reached 14 consecutive finals from 1994 to 2007 and reached 21 world finals overall, all of which are records. He held the world number one ranking for thirteen years in total, including eight in a row from 2006 to 2013. He won 70 PDC Pro Tour events, which was a record until Michael van Gerwen surpassed it in February 2019. Taylor hit a record 11 televised nine-dart finishes (and 22 overall). He was also the first person to hit two nine-dart finishes in the same match.

Taylor won the PDC Player of the Year award six times (2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012) and was twice nominated for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, in 2006 and 2010; in the latter year, he finished as runner-up, making him the first darts player to finish in the top two. He was inducted into the PDC Hall of Fame in 2011. He retired from professional darts after the , where he finished as runner-up. He competed in the first three World Seniors Darts Championships from 2022 to 2024 but no longer plays darts competitively.

==Early life==
Taylor was born on 13 August 1960 in Stoke-on-Trent, the only child of Douglas and Elizabeth Taylor. His father worked at Platt&#x27;s tile factory in Tunstall and the family lived in a dilapidated terraced house nearby, sleeping downstairs because the upstairs was condemned and boarded up. His childhood home had no electricity or running water, and he often scavenged for scrap metal or coal with his parents. Taylor enjoyed watching boxing as a child, and he played cricket for Mill Hill Middle School in Burslem. After leaving school at age 16, he worked in a variety of manual jobs, including as a sheet metal worker, but his main occupation became manufacturing ceramic toilet roll holders, for which he earned £52 a week. 

In 1977, when he was 17, Taylor met 15-year-old Yvonne at a disco in Tunstall. In 1982, after dating for five years, they began living together in a terraced house in Burslem that Taylor had purchased for £7,500, paying a mortgage of £80 a month. The first of their four children was born the following year. Taylor, whose father had taught him to play darts, occasionally played money games in pubs against county players, using his winnings to buy household items such as saucepans and carpet. He recalled once winning £500, which he used to have a shower fitted in the family home. &quot;It was great. You&#x27;d have thought we were in Buckingham Palace,&quot; he commented. 

In 1985, Taylor and Yvonne attended an exhibition match at a pub in Smallthorne by then-reigning world champion Eric Bristow, who had recently moved to North Staffordshire. After Taylor claimed he could beat Bristow, Yvonne bought him a new set of darts for his 25th birthday. He started practising regularly, often at Bristow&#x27;s pub, the Crafty Cockney on Moorland Road in Burslem. (The pub is currently known as the Moorland Inn.) Within two years, Taylor was playing county darts for Staffordshire alongside Bristow. Impressed by Taylor&#x27;s potential, Bristow lent him £10,000 to take care of his family as he established himself as a professional darts player, on condition that he give up his job in the ceramics industry.

==Early career (1987–1993)==
Bristow sponsored Taylor and they travelled to Las Vegas where Taylor was beaten in the first round of the North American Open as he struggled during his first year on tour.

Taylor&#x27;s first title came at the Canadian Open in 1988, defeating then World Champion Bob Anderson in the final. After reaching the quarter-final of the British Open and the semi-final of the Winmau World Masters in 1989, he qualified for the World Championship for the first time in 1990. Although he had achieved some success in Open events, he went into the 1990 World Championship as a 125–1 unseeded outsider. He beat number six seed Russell Stewart 3–1 in the first round, Dennis Hickling 3–0 in the second round, Ronnie Sharp 4–2 in the quarter-finals and Cliff Lazarenko 5–0 to reach the final. He would then meet his mentor, Eric Bristow.

Bristow had been suffering with dartitis since 1986 but had recovered his world number one ranking to be the top seed in the event. After sharing the first two sets, Taylor beat Bristow 6–1 in sets to claim his first world title. For the rest of 1990, Taylor dominated the Open events taking the titles in the Isle of Man, Finland, North America, Denmark as well as the British Pentathlon, British Masters, Europe Cup and the game&#x27;s second major tournament at the time, the Winmau World Masters.

Taylor&#x27;s defence of the World Championship in 1991 ended at the quarter-final stage with a loss to Dennis Priestley, who went on to win his first world title. He picked up fewer titles in 1991 losing both his Danish Open and World Masters titles in finals to Rod Harrington. Taylor regained the World Championship title the following year beating Mike Gregory 6–5 in the final in a deciding leg. Gregory had missed six darts to win the title himself. Taylor has described the win as one of the favourites of his career. In 1993, Taylor became the landlord at the Cricketers Arms in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

==Split in darts==

From a peak during the 1980s, the game of darts had lost many sponsors and almost all television coverage. Players felt that the BDO was no longer serving the interests of the game at the top level. In 1993, Taylor was among a group of top players, which included every previous world champion, who broke away from the game&#x27;s ruling body, the British Darts Organisation, and formed their own organisation, the World Darts Council (WDC), later renamed the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC).

In the 1993 World Championship, the last unified World Championship to be held, Taylor lost in the second round to Kevin Spiolek. The BDO refused to allow the new organisation to set up and run their own tournaments, so the WDC players decided that they would no longer compete in the BDO World Championship. They founded the WDC World Darts Championship as an alternative. In the first WDC World Championship in 1994, Taylor lost to Priestley. However, Taylor would go on to dominate the event for the following decade and beyond.

==PDC career==

===1994 to 1998===
After losing to Priestley in the final of the first PDC World Championship in 1994, Taylor began to dominate the event. Rod Harrington reached his first World Championship final in 1995 and, although he had won his previous three finals against Taylor in 1991 and 1992, Taylor took the title 6–2. It would be Harrington&#x27;s only appearance in a World Final.

The finals of 1996, 1997 and 1998 would all feature Taylor and Priestley in a repeat of the inaugural final in 1994. Priestley achieved the first 100 average in a final in 1996 but still lost 6–4. The 1997 final saw Taylor recover from 0–2 down to win the title 6–3, and the 1998 final saw Taylor lose just two legs in the entire match en route to a 6–0 win and an average of 103.98. Taylor&#x27;s victory and sixth title in 1998 meant that he had surpassed his mentor Eric Bristow&#x27;s haul of five World Championships.

Taylor&#x27;s record at Blackpool in the WDC&#x27;s second major event, the World Matchplay, was not as strong early in his career as it has been in recent times. Taylor lost to Bob Anderson in 1994, Peter Evison in 1996 and Ronnie Baxter in 1998. However, he still won the event twice in the first five years of its existence, beating Priestley 16–11 in 1995 and Alan Warriner-Little 16–11 in 1997.

===1999 to 2004===
Taylor stretched his PDC World Championship unbeaten run to a record eight consecutive years beating Peter Manley in the 1999 and 2002 finals, Priestley for a fourth time in 2000, and John Part in 2001. Part would finally end the run by beating Taylor 7–6 (sets) in the 2003 World Championship final. Sid Waddell attributed this defeat to a weight-loss of three stone which he claimed affected Taylor&#x27;s balance and resulted in him throwing &quot;a quarter to half an inch below the 60 bed&quot;. Taylor went into the game a 1/7 favourite with bookmakers, but Part raced into leads of 3–0 and 4–1. Taylor fought back before ultimately being defeated 7–6.

Taylor would improve his record at Blackpool during this spell. After losing the 1999 semi-final of the World Matchplay to Manley, he would go on to win the title for the next five years (2000–2004) beating five different opponents in the final: Alan Warriner-Little (2000), Richie Burnett (2001), John Part (2002), Wayne Mardle (2003) and Mark Dudbridge (2004). By the end of 2004, Taylor had won 11 World Championships and seven World Matchplays.

Taylor has faced the incumbent BDO World Champion in challenge matches on two occasions. In 1999, he beat Raymond van Barneveld by 21 legs to 10 in a one-hour challenge dubbed &quot;The Match of the Century&quot; at the Wembley Conference Centre. The second challenge match came in 2004 against Andy Fordham at the Circus Tavern. Taylor was leading 5–2 in sets when Fordham, suffering a suspected asthma attack, abandoned the match.

===2004 to 2008===
Taylor reclaimed the World Championship in 2004 after edging Kevin Painter in the final 7–6 following a sudden death leg. After the match, having trailed 4–1 and 5–3, Taylor described himself as &quot;a very lucky man&quot; claiming that &quot;Kevin out-played me&quot;. Referring to the epic World Championship final the previous year in which he had been defeated by John Part, Taylor added: &quot;Last year was a good final, but this is one of the best&quot;.

Taylor would continue his dominance throughout 2005. However, after winning his 13th World Championship title in January 2006, he lost four matches in televised tournaments during the first half of the year. He lost to Jelle Klaasen and Simon Whitlock in the International Darts League tournament, and twice in a row to Raymond van Barneveld in the UK Open and the Las Vegas Desert Classic. He bounced back in the second half of the year to win the World Matchplay, the World Darts Trophy (a BDO affiliated event), and the World Grand Prix.

The 2007 World Final was contested between Taylor and Raymond van Barneveld. The match was tied at 6–6 in sets with van Barneveld leading 2–1 in legs. However, Van Barneveld missed four darts and Taylor tied the set at 2–2. The set went to 5–5 before van Barneveld won the sudden death leg for his fifth World Championship (four with the BDO and one with the PDC). Taylor said: &quot;Of all the finals I&#x27;ve played in, I would probably put this one as the best.&quot;

=== 2007 to 2008 ===
Chris Mason hit the headlines for criticising Taylor in the newspapers before their last 16 match at the 2007 World Championship and allegedly swearing at him during the post-match handshake on-stage after Taylor beat him 4–0. He did apologise to Taylor after the tournament ended, but received a £750 fine and a four-month ban (suspended for 12 months) from the Darts Regulation Authority.

2007 proved to be Taylor&#x27;s most barren year in terms of major title success. He was defeated at the International Darts League and the World Darts Trophy in the Netherlands. At the UK Open in Bolton, he suffered an 11–4 loss to van Barneveld. He lost to Mark Dudbridge
at the Las Vegas Desert Classic, and lost at the World Matchplay in Blackpool. At the World Grand Prix in Dublin, he lost to Adrian Gray. Taylor feared that his career was in decline but vowed to continue until 2012.

Having appeared in 14 out of 14 PDC World Darts Championship finals between 1994 and 2007, Taylor&#x27;s record run came to an end in 2008 where he was beaten in the quarter-final. This was the first time that he had not reached the final stage of the PDC World Darts Championship. Taylor had been taken to the final set in each of his first three rounds before eventually losing to Wayne Mardle 5–4 (sets) after winning the opening three sets.

Before the start of the Premier League tournament, Taylor unveiled some new black 26g darts. After a poor start to his Premier League Darts campaign which included three defeats in his first four matches, Taylor ultimately finished at the top of the Premier League standings. He beat Adrian Lewis 11–1 with a 112.68 average in the semi-final, and went on to win his fourth consecutive Premier League title with a 16–8 victory over Wade whilst averaging 108.36. He won his second US Open title in May 2008, defeating Colin Lloyd in the final. At the UK Open, Taylor was defeated 10–9 in the quarter-final by Raymond van Barneveld.

Taylor went on a surge of form from the spring of 2008, by winning his fourth Las Vegas Desert Classic title. Taylor then went on to win the World Matchplay, World Grand Prix, the inaugural European Championship, and the Grand Slam of Darts.

===2009 to 2011===
In the 2009 world final, Taylor beat Raymond van Barneveld 7–1 for his fourteenth World Championship title. His 110.94 three-dart average was the highest recorded in a PDC final. His average during the course of the tournament was 104.08. In June, Taylor beat Colin Osborne 11–6 in the final of the UK Open. It was his third title overall at the event and his first since 2005. His tournament average was 107.38.

More success followed throughout 2009 with Taylor winning his fifth Las Vegas Desert Classic at what was the final instalment of the event. Taylor would also win the World Matchplay, the World Grand Prix, the European Darts Championship (achieving an overall 3-dart average per tournament of 111.54) and, for the third successive time, the Grand Slam of Darts in November.

Taylor began 2010 by winning his fifteenth World Championship title. He beat Simon Whitlock in the final 7–3 with an average of 104.38 and sealed victory with a 131 checkout. Taylor lost in the semi-final of the Players Championship at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet. Whilst attempting to defend the title he won in 2009 at the inaugural staging of the event, Taylor lost to eventual champion Paul Nicholson. Taylor admitted, following his defeat, that he had had little time to practice after his World Championship win. Taylor made history in the 2010 Premier League final against defending champion James Wade by hitting two nine-dart finishes in the same match. This was the first time that this had been done in professional darts.

By the summer of 2010, Taylor was the holder of the World Championship, the World Matchplay, the Premier League, the UK Open, the European Championship, the World Grand Prix and the Grand Slam of Darts. In fact, the only major televised title not held by Taylor at this time was the Players Championship Finals. At the UK Open, Taylor broke the world record for the highest average in a televised game by averaging 118.66 against Kevin Painter in round four- he won the match 9–0. These noteworthy performances, in addition to his longevity, contributed to Taylor&#x27;s nomination for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 2010. He was voted runner-up to A.P. McCoy.

However, defeats in the World Grand Prix, the Grand Slam, as well as a surprising loss to Mark Webster five sets to two in the quarter-final of the 2011 World Championship, meant that Taylor began 2011 as holder of four major titles- the World Matchplay, the Premier League, the European Championship and the UK Open.
He would bounce back and win his first major tournament in seven months at the 2011 Players Championship by beating Gary Anderson 13–12 in a thrilling final.

Taylor went on to win the World Matchplay for a record 12th time in 18 years in 2011. He beat Mark Hylton 10–8 in the 1st round, Wayne Jones 13–7 in the 2nd round, Wes Newton 16–5 in the quarter-final, Andy Hamilton 17–9 in the semi-final and James Wade 18–8 in the final. His overall tournament average was more than 106.

One week later, Taylor went to Düsseldorf to compete in the 2011 European Championship. He was aiming to win his fourth consecutive European title and did just that by beating John Michael 6–3, Mervyn King 10–3, Paul Nicholson 10–7, Simon Whitlock 11–4 and Adrian Lewis 11–8. He had a tournament average of 105.15.

On 27 September, Taylor competed in Group One of the Championship League and won all seven of his qualifying games: 6–3 against Adrian Lewis, 6–2 against Terry Jenkins, 6–3 against Wes Newton, 6–2 against James Wade, 6–3 against Simon Whitlock, 6–2 against Gary Anderson and 6–1 against Mark Webster. Taylor finished the group stage with a maximum 14 points, a leg difference of +28 (42 legs won and 16 lost), as well as £2,100 won during qualifying. However, he lost the semi-final 6–5 against Wes Newton but still won a further £500 in that match. This took his total winnings for the day to £2,600. As a result of not winning Group One, Taylor returned the following day to play in Group Two.

In Group Two, Taylor won six out of his seven games. He lost his fourth match 6–4 to Simon Whitlock, but defeated James Wade 6–1, Mervyn King 6–4, Paul Nicholson 6–0, Mark Webster 6–3, Wes Newton 6–4 and Andy Hamilton 6–1. He would finish top of the group with 12 points, a leg difference of +21 (40 legs won and 19 lost), as well as £2,000 won in qualifying. Taylor beat Paul Nicholson 6–3 in the semi-final and Simon Whitlock 6–5 in the final to win Group Two and progress to the Winner&#x27;s Group.

In the Winner&#x27;s Group, Taylor won all seven of his qualifying games. He beat Gary Anderson 6–5, Steve Beaton 6–3, Mervyn King 6–3 (hitting his 10th nine-dart finish in competition in the process), Mark Walsh 6–3, Simon Whitlock 6–5, Paul Nicholson 6–1 and Dennis Priestley 6–2 to qualify top of the group. He beat Steve Beaton 6–1 in the semi-final and Paul Nicholson 6–1 in the final to win his second Championship League title. Taylor won £6,600 in the group stages as well as a further £10,000 for winning the title.

In November, Taylor won the Grand Slam of Darts by beating Gary Anderson in the final 16–4. However, he was unable to defend his Players Championship title following an 8–5 loss in the last 16 to Mervyn King.

===2012===

In 2012, Taylor failed to make the quarter-finals of the PDC World Championship for the first time in his career following a shock four sets to one defeat in the second round by Dave Chisnall.

Taylor, looking to improve upon England&#x27;s second round exit in 2010, represented England alongside Adrian Lewis in his second World Cup of Darts. Taylor began the tournament sluggishly, losing his singles matches against Ken MacNeil of Canada and Gary Mawson of the United States. England progressed following a sudden-death leg against Canada and a doubles victory against the United States. A comfortable 5–1 win over Wales booked England&#x27;s place in the final against the Australian pairing of Simon Whitlock and Paul Nicholson. Taylor won both his singles matches (including a 105.93 average against Whitlock). However, England lost the doubles meaning that the tie was level on points at 3–3 and consequently, would require a sudden-death leg. It proved to be a tense finale as Australia missed four darts to win the title. Taylor also missed two before Lewis took out double five to clinch England&#x27;s first World Cup of Darts title.

Four days later, Taylor played Lewis in the first week of the 2012 Premier League and managed to draw 7–7 from a 6–1 deficit. He averaged 112.79, which was until 2015 the highest average achieved by someone without actually winning the match. Taylor hit the ninth televised nine-darter of his career in the second week of the Premier League on the way to an 8–5 win against Kevin Painter. Two weeks later, he beat Simon Whitlock 8–4 and registered the highest three-dart average in the history of the tournament of 117.35. In week 13, Taylor beat James Wade 8–1 and averaged 116.10 in the process. Taylor ended the league campaign top of the table (eight points ahead of second placed Simon Whitlock) and was the only player to have a positive leg difference. In the 14 game league phase, Taylor had registered five of the top fifteen televised three-dart averages in the history of the game. In the semi-finals, he faced James Wade against whom he had inflicted heavy 8–1 and 8–2 defeats during the league stage. The semi-final, however, was much more competitive. Taylor trailed early on before winning four consecutive legs to lead 6–4 before Wade responded to level at 6–6. Taylor then took out a 149 finish, with Wade on 57, to break before closing out the match 8–6 to reach the final against Simon Whitlock. Taylor looked to be heading for a comfortable win in the final as he raced into a 7–2 lead. However, the Australian stormed back to level at 7–7. Nevertheless, Taylor held his nerve to win the last three legs of the match to complete a 10–7 win and to seal his sixth Premier League title.

Taylor won the third event of the Players Championship in March with a 6–1 victory over Wes Newton while averaging 113.54. He also hit a nine-darter earlier in the tournament during his second round match against Tony West. He reached the final of the fourth Players Championship event a day later where he lost 6–5 to Dave Chisnall. Taylor hit his second nine-dart finish of the weekend in a first round match against Peter Hudson.

In June, Taylor looked on course to win his fifth UK Open title after registering convincing wins over Ronnie Baxter, Terry Jenkins and Denis Ovens to book a place in the final against Robert Thornton. Taylor won the first two legs, but the Scot then won nine of the next 10 before closing out the match 11–5. Taylor had missed a total of 23 darts at doubles and, in doing so, suffered his sixth defeat in a major PDC final out of the 72 he had contested. Taylor then played in his first European Tour event and gained revenge for his defeat in the World Championship by beating Chisnall 6–2 in the final. He had beaten Raymond van Barneveld 6–5 in the quarter-finals and Wes Newton 6–3 in the semis at the event in Berlin. In July, Taylor walked off the stage at the Shetland Open during a semi-final match with Raymond van Barneveld.

Taylor then won his fifth consecutive World Matchplay title and thirteenth in total. He beat Mervyn King 10–8, Ian White 13–3, Andy Hamilton 16–11 and Ronnie Baxter 17–10 to face James Wade in the final for the fourth time. The final proved to be tight and tense, with Taylor edging it 18–15 and extending his unbeaten run at the event to 25 games.

In September, Taylor suffered defeat in the European Championship for the first time in a 10–6 quarter-final loss to Brendan Dolan. He averaged just 89.88 in a defeat which ended his run of four consecutive titles stretching back to the inaugural tournament in 2008. Taylor then lost to Thornton in a major event for the second time this year as he missed six match darts on the way to a three sets to two defeat in the second round of the World Grand Prix.

Taylor qualified from Group 4 of the Championship League winning all nine of his games and concluding with a 6–1 win over Mark Walsh. In the winners&#x27; group, he won each of his seven league matches before defeating Dave Chisnall 6–0 in the semi-finals (averaging 112.73) and Simon Whitlock 6–4 in the final (averaging 108.20) to clinch his third Championship League title.

Taylor finished second in Group A of the Grand Slam of Darts to face Michael van Gerwen in the last 16. It was a match that was billed as a clash between the two best players in the world. Taylor averaged 105 but failed to hit a single maximum as van Gerwen hit seven and averaged 108 in a 10–5 win.

Taylor lost in consecutive Players Championship finals over the last weekend of November to both Chisnall and Van Gerwen, averaging 110 in the latter. He finished sixth on the ProTour Order of Merit to qualify for the Finals where he won his third title. Taylor defeated Mark Webster and Adrian Lewis in the first two rounds, but was then 9–5 down in the quarter-finals to Andy Hamilton in a best of 19 legs match. However, Taylor allowed Hamilton only one chance to win the match when on a 60 finish. Hamilton missed the board with his first dart and failed to hit double 20 with his third as Taylor won the five consecutive legs he required to win 10–9. He outplayed Simon Whitlock in the semi-finals in an 11–2 victory and, with the scores at 5–5 in the final against Kim Huybrechts, Taylor produced a devastating run of form to win eight of the following nine legs to secure the title.

===2013===
Taylor won his 16th World Championship at the 2013 staging of the event. He lost nine legs on the way to the semi-finals where he played Raymond van Barneveld. Before the match, Taylor had taken offence to comments made by van Barneveld about not being scared of him and wanting to face him rather than Taylor&#x27;s quarter-final opponent Andy Hamilton. Taylor raced into a five sets to one lead and withstood a strong fightback from van Barneveld before winning 6–4. After the match, Taylor reacted angrily when van Barneveld attempted to pull him back to congratulate him after their handshake. The pair were escorted from the stage separately by security staff. The next day, Taylor apologised for his behaviour which he described as &quot;disgraceful&quot;. Taylor faced Michael van Gerwen in the final and, from 4–2 down, won five sets in a row to become the first man to lift the Sid Waddell Trophy. A day later, he was named the PDC Player of the Year.

Taylor retained his World Cup of Darts crown alongside Adrian Lewis in February. They survived two match darts against South Africa in the last 16 and one against Wales in the semi-finals before facing the Belgian brothers Ronny and Kim Huybrechts in the final. Taylor beat Ronny 4–0 and went into his second singles match knowing that a win against Kim would secure the title. He did just that by virtue of a 4–1 win.

Taylor did not finish top of the Premier League for the first time this year. He won eight, drew four and lost four of his 16 matches to finish third in the table. He played Van Barneveld in the semi-finals who he had beaten 7–3 and drawn with 6–6 during the league stage. From 3–3, Taylor surged ahead to triumph 8–4 and book his spot in the final against Van Gerwen. Taylor started the better of the two as he led 5–3 at the break. However, he then lost four successive legs upon the resumption of play. In the 14th leg, Van Gerwen opted not to go for the bull when on 87 and Taylor stepped in to hit a 160 finish to level the match at 7–7. At 9–8 down, Taylor had left 40 after 12 darts. Nonetheless, Van Gerwen hit a 132 finish on the bull to seal a 10–8 win and the title.

Taylor won his fifth UK Open title at his next event. He had to compete in the second round due to being ranked 44th on the UK Open Order of Merit after competing in four of the eight Qualifiers and not advancing beyond the quarter-finals in any of them. At the tournament, he dropped three legs in his first three matches before getting lucky in the last 16 against Brendan Dolan. Dolan missed three match darts to win 9–7 before Taylor threw an 11 dart leg in the decider. He produced an average of 106.56 to beat Van Gerwen 10–7 before easing past Peter Wright 10–5 in the semi-finals and Andy Hamilton 11–4 in the final. Taylor&#x27;s combined average during the six matches he played was more than 100.

Taylor then won the Gibraltar Darts Trophy. He dropped just seven legs in the six matches he played which concluded with a 6–1 victory over Jamie Lewis in the final. However, Taylor&#x27;s win in Gibraltar was later the subject of controversy as footage emerged showing him winning a leg and retrieving his dart when he had actually missed the double. Neither referee Russ Bray nor his opponent Dean Winstanley noticed the error and Taylor went on to win the match 6–1. Taylor insisted that he had not realised that the dart had missed and offered to replay the match and forfeit his prize money. The PDC released a statement blaming the incident on human error. The incident led to a feud with Taylor&#x27;s old mentor Eric Bristow who stated: &quot;The player knows if it&#x27;s not in the bed and has to declare it. You don&#x27;t want cheats in the game&quot;. Taylor responded by claiming that Bristow&#x27;s comments were &quot;hurtful&quot; and that he would not be talking to Bristow again.

At the European Championship, Taylor lost in the second round to Ronny Huybrechts 10–5. Taylor then won his sixth consecutive World Matchplay crown and 14th in total by defeating Adrian Lewis 18–13 in the final with an average of 111.23, a record for a Matchplay final. His tournament average through 123 legs was 105.81. Taylor&#x27;s next event was the Sydney Darts Masters which he won by beating Van Gerwen 10–3 in the final whilst averaging 109.46. Taylor continued his dominance in the major events by claiming his 11th World Grand Prix title in October. He thrashed Dave Chisnall 6–0 in sets in the final with Chisnall having to wait until the final set to pick up his first leg of the match. Taylor then won the Championship League title for the fourth time in six years. After claiming Group 1 by beating Lewis 6–1, having also hit a nine-darter earlier in the day, Taylor topped the Winners Group and went on to defeat Van Gerwen 6–3 in the final. At the inaugural staging of the Masters, a tournament which only features the top 16 on the Order of Merit, Taylor cruised to the title dropping just seven legs during the event which included 10–1 thrashings of James Wade and Lewis in the semi-finals and final respectively.

Taylor was involved in a high quality darts match in the semi-finals of the Grand Slam of Darts against Lewis as he averaged 109.76 to Lewis&#x27; 110.99 (the highest recorded combined average) in a 16–9 win. Taylor&#x27;s finishing in the high scoring match proved to be the difference and included checkouts of 167 and 160. The players hit 32 180s between them breaking the PDC record of 31 which was set in the 2007 World Championship final, a match which had 32 more legs than this one. Both players described the game as the greatest they had been involved in afterwards. The final proved to be a more low-key affair as Taylor gained revenge over Robert Thornton for his loss in the 2012 UK Open to win 16–6 and seal his fifth Grand Slam title.

Taylor eased through to the final of the Players Championship Finals but fell victim to one of Van Gerwen&#x27;s purple patches as, from 6–3 down, the Dutchman won seven legs in a row and went on to defeat Taylor 11–7.

===2014===
Taylor was 1/50 with bookmakers to win his second round match against Michael Smith in the 2014 World Championship but suffered a huge upset by losing 4–3 to the world number 32. Taylor lost the world number one spot to Michael van Gerwen after the event as the Dutchman won his first world title. He returned to action at the Premier League six weeks later with a new set of darts having switched manufacturers. However, Taylor suffered his first whitewash in the tournament&#x27;s history as Van Gerwen thrashed him 7–0 in 13 minutes. Taylor bounced back a few days later to win the third UK Open Qualifier by defeating Adrian Lewis 6–2 and sealing the title with a nine-darter. It was his second perfect leg of the day after he had also hit one in the last 16 against Andy Hamilton. However, his poor start to the Premier League continued as he lost three of his next four games to find himself in real danger of relegation.
At the UK Open, he was the victim of the biggest shock in the tournament&#x27;s history as factory worker Aden Kirk, ranked world number 137 and making his television debut, beat Taylor 9–7. This run of form prompted &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Rob Smyth to write an article suggesting that Taylor&#x27;s decline was now terminal.

Taylor lost 6–5 against Gary Anderson in the final of the third Players Championship. Earlier in the tournament, he had beaten Van Gerwen 6–5, who averaged 114 and hit a nine-darter. He had also seen off Terry Jenkins 6–4, who averaged 111. 24 hours later he won the fourth event following a 6–0 thrashing of Ian White in the final. Taylor played seven matches on the day and ended up with an overall average of 106.59, which included an average of 118.42 against Vincent van der Voort in the last 16. Taylor claimed another title at the German Darts Masters by beating Van Gerwen 6–4 in the final.

His form in the Premier League picked up remarkably as he remained unbeaten in his final 11 matches which included a 7–4 victory over Van Gerwen. Taylor finished third in the table for the second year in a row to qualify for the play-offs. Taylor led Raymond van Barneveld 3–0 in the semi-finals, but hit 26% of his doubles during the match and, ultimately, was defeated 8–5. This was the first time that the Dutchman had beaten him in the tournament in 21 attempts. Later, Taylor said that the six missed darts at double to move 5–2 ahead had played heavily on his mind and had made him nervous during the match- a feeling which he had never experienced before during his 26-year career.

Taylor and Lewis could not complete a hat-trick of World Cup of Darts titles as they were defeated by the Netherlands in the final. Taylor lost 4–0 to Van Gerwen, while Lewis was beaten 4–0 by Van Barneveld and 4–2 by Van Gerwen, which meant that the tie was over before Taylor&#x27;s second singles match. Taylor later reflected on the first half of 2014 as the worst spell of form in his career.

Taylor threw his 10th televised nine-dart finish in the second round of the World Matchplay during a 13–6 win over Michael Smith. He returned to top form during the event beating Gary Anderson 17–15 with an average of 105.27 in the semi-finals. However, Taylor saved his best performance for the final as he raced into 7–1 and 13–2 leads over Van Gerwen and went on to seal his seventh consecutive Matchplay title and 15th in total with an 18–9 victory whilst averaging 107.27.

Taylor won the inaugural Perth Darts Masters after beating Van Gerwen in the final 11–9 whilst averaging 105.08. He then defended his Sydney Darts Masters title by beating Stephen Bunting 11–3 in the final. In the quarter-finals of the World Grand Prix, Taylor lost 3–1 against James Wade. This was the first time that Wade had beaten Taylor in a major televised knockout tournament. At the European Championship, Taylor lost 10–9 in a thriller to Stephen Bunting. Taylor comfortably progressed to the final of the Grand Slam and a meeting with Dave Chisnall. Following an initial 5–0 lead, the final was by far his closest match of the event as Chisnall fought back to 10–10, before Taylor rediscovered his best form to win another five unanswered legs and seal his sixth Grand Slam title 16–13.

===2015===
Taylor reached the semi-finals of the 2015 World Championship without facing a top 16 player. His closest game came in the third round where he edged past Kim Huybrechts 4–3. Taylor maintained his unbeaten semi-final record in World Championships as he won his 20th by beating Raymond van Barneveld 6–2 and faced Gary Anderson in the final. From 3–1 down, Taylor won nine of the next ten legs to move 4–3 up and then missed three darts to lead 5–3. Instead he fell 6–4 behind, but again rallied to draw level missing one dart at double 12 for a nine darter in the process. However, more failed attempts at doubles proved costly as he could not take out double 16 with three darts to hold throw in the deciding set and was defeated 7–6. The 32 180s the pair threw during the game broke the PDC World Championship final record of 31 which was set in Taylor&#x27;s match against Van Barneveld in the 2007 final.

Taylor won the last UK Open Qualifier by overcoming Ian White 6–2 in the final. He lost 10–6 in the quarter-finals of the UK Open itself. In week seven of the Premier League, Taylor averaged 115.80 against Van Barneveld but was defeated 7–4. It is the eighth highest televised average of all-time and the highest to lose a match. He went into the penultimate round of fixtures needing a victory over Anderson to stand a chance of progressing but, when he lost 7–5, it marked the first time in the 11-year history of the event that Taylor did not qualify for the play-offs. He did average 102.95 over his 16 matches, second to Van Gerwen&#x27;s 105.15. Taylor picked up his second title of the year at the ninth Players Championship with a 6–4 victory over Anderson in the final. He thrashed Anderson 11–3 in the semi-finals of the Dubai Darts Masters, before missing too many doubles from 8–6 ahead of Van Gerwen in the final, to lose 11–8. Taylor and Lewis played in the final of the World Cup against Scotland&#x27;s Anderson and Peter Wright and it went all the way to the final singles match in which Lewis beat Wright to win England&#x27;s third title in the event. Taylor had kicked off the final by beating Wright 4–0 whilst setting the highest individual average in the history of the event at 113.43. He followed that up by holding on from 7–2 ahead of Wright in the final of the inaugural Japan Darts Masters to edge it 8–7.

Taylor&#x27;s 38-match unbeaten streak at the World Matchplay dating back to 2007 ended this year at the semi-final stage as Wade defeated him 17–14. After the event he slipped from second place to third in the Order of Merit, but then retained his Perth Darts Masters title by seeing off Wade 11–7. His third World Series of Darts win of the year came at the Sydney Darts Masters with an 11–3 thrashing of Adrian Lewis. A shock 2–0 elimination in the first round of the World Grand Prix followed at the hands of Vincent van der Voort. He also missed a dart at the bullseye for a nine-dart finish during the match.

Taylor held 3–0 and 7–3 leads over Van Gerwen in the final of the Grand Slam, but then missed far too many doubles and went on to lose 16–13. The defeat meant that Taylor held no majors for the first time since 1994.

=== 2016 ===
In the third round of the 2016 World Championship, Jelle Klaasen missed one dart to knock Taylor out and the match went to a deciding set. Taylor went 2–0 up in legs and a missed a match dart himself in the next, before Klaasen fought back to win the final set 4–2. In the semi-finals of the Masters, Taylor missed seven match darts to beat Van Gerwen and would lose 11–10. Taylor reached the final of the first UK Open Qualifier and lost to Adrian Lewis 6–2, but went one better in the third event as he averaged 109.59 in a 6–2 win over Van Gerwen to end a nine-month drought of a ranking title win. Van Gerwen broke Taylor&#x27;s world record televised average with 123.40 in week four of the Premier League. An hour later Taylor averaged 115.25, currently the 12th highest of all-time as he overcame Dave Chisnall 7–5. In March, Taylor was beaten in the semi-finals of the UK Open 10–6 by Van Gerwen.
He was also convincingly beaten by Van Gerwen in his eighth Premier League final by 11 legs to 3.

Taylor and Lewis won their fourth World Cup crown by overcoming the Netherlands in the final, with Lewis beating Van Gerwen in the deciding match. 
Taylor competed in one PDC European Tour event during 2016, which was the Austrian Darts Open, but he won the title, defeating Michael Smith 6–4 in the final. During the final of the World Matchplay, Taylor encouraged the crowd to do a clapping chant made famous by the Icelandic football team in Euro 2016 when Van Gerwen was throwing. It did not seem to affect Van Gerwen though, as he won 18–10. Taylor is still the only player to have won the Sydney Darts Masters after he beat Van Gerwen 11–9 for his fourth title in the event.

Taylor participated in the inaugural Champions League of Darts, an event that was broadcast on the BBC. It was the first time since 1993 that Taylor had played in an event shown by the station and he dominated it by winning 52 legs over the weekend whilst losing 19, culminating with an 11–5 victory over Van Gerwen in the final. Taylor had surprise 2–0 and 10–3 defeats to Steve West in first round of the World Grand Prix and Mensur Suljović in the quarter-finals of the European Championship. He also lost 16–10 to Peter Wright in the quarter-finals of the Grand Slam.

===2017===
Taylor matched John Lowe&#x27;s record by making 28 consecutive appearances at the World Championship in the 2017 edition. He didn&#x27;t drop a set in matches against David Platt and Kevin Painter and had a three sets to nil lead against Kim Huybrechts in their third round match. Huybrechts took two consecutive sets, but missed darts to force a decider and Taylor hit double seven to set up a quarter-final match against Raymond van Barneveld. In a rematch of the final ten years prior, Taylor recovered from a 3–1 deficit but lost the next two sets and, consequently, the match.

Taylor was sixth in the world rankings after the World Championship. On 27 January 2017, in an interview conducted before the start of the 2017 Masters, Taylor officially confirmed that he would retire after the 2018 World Darts Championship. He also stated that he would cut down on his non-televised appearances in the 2017 season. He did not play in the Grand Prix or UK Open. He reached the semi-finals of the Masters, losing 11–9 to Gary Anderson. He finished third in the table in the 2017 Premier League and trailed Peter Wright 4–0 in the semi-finals. Taylor gained the lead for the first time at 7–6, but missed a host of doubles including one to win the match and was beaten 10–9.

Taylor did make a final appearance at the World Matchplay, which he had previously said was his favourite tournament. He won the tournament for a sixteenth time, progressing to the final with victories over career-rivals van Barneveld (11–3), van Gerwen (16–6), Lewis (17–9), before beating Peter Wright 18–8 in the final, in what would be his last major win. Taylor also won a world series event in his final season, and reached the final of his last event in the series, which he lost to Wright. In August, Taylor won the inaugural Melbourne Darts Masters by successfully defeating Peter Wright 11–8 in the final.

===2018===
The 2018 PDC World Darts Championship was Taylor&#x27;s 29th world championship appearance, surpassing the record he held jointly with John Lowe. He had previously announced that he would retire after the tournament. He entered the tournament ranked 6th in the PDC Order of Merit. Wins over Chris Dobey, Justin Pipe, Keegan Brown, Gary Anderson and Jamie Lewis took him to his 21st world final, extending his own record. However, he was beaten 7–2 in the final by Rob Cross, who was making his first appearance in the tournament. During the match, Taylor also missed a double for a nine-dart finish, which would have been his first in a world championship match. Taylor said afterwards: &quot;I tried my best but he was like me 25 years ago, he was relentless and didn&#x27;t stop putting me under pressure.&quot; He added: &quot;It was like an old man against a young man, it was a mis-match. That&#x27;s it for me because I haven&#x27;t got the energy or interest to beat Michael van Gerwen or him (Cross).&quot;

==Post-retirement==
Taylor took part in his first competitive darts event since 2018, when he entered the inaugural 2022 World Seniors Darts Championship. He lost to Kevin Painter in the quarter-finals. Taylor played his final world championship match at the 2024 World Seniors Darts Championship, where he was beaten 3–2 by debutant Manfred Bilderl.

==Rivalries==
===Dennis Priestley===
Dennis Priestley and Phil Taylor played each other in five World Finals, with Priestley winning in 1994 and Taylor emerging victorious in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2000.

Taylor and Priestley first met in major competition in the 1990 World Masters. Taylor won that semi-final encounter en route to the title. Priestley then assumed the upper hand in their rivalry, however, with victories over Taylor in the quarter-finals of the 1991 World Championship, and in the British Matchplay final later that year. Their early meetings in the WDC were also won by Priestley, who defeated Taylor in the final of the 1994 World Championship, and in the Last 16 of the 1995 UK Matchplay.

However, since Taylor&#x27;s win over Priestley in the 1995 World Matchplay final, Taylor has lost once in all competitions and hasn&#x27;t been beaten on television by Priestley since 1995. Taylor and Priestley remain great friends. At the 2009 Las Vegas championship Taylor was emotional when he beat Dennis Priestley 8–0 in the second round. He later said it was tough to beat such a great friend that way. Taylor and Priestley met in competition on at least 44 occasions, with Taylor winning 37 and Priestley winning 6, with 1 draw.

===John Part===
Taylor&#x27;s next rivalry was with Canadian John Part, who won the BDO World Championship in 1994 and moved to the PDC in 1997. Their first meeting in the PDC came at the 2001 PDC World Championship final. The match was one-sided as Taylor averaged 107 and won 7–0. Taylor won their first five encounters including a 6–0 quarter final win at the 2002 PDC World Championships, a much closer match at the 2002 World Matchplay final, 18–16 and the 2002 World Grand Prix final, where Taylor again ended Part&#x27;s attempt at a title by winning 7–3.

A turning point came in the 2003 World Championship, where Part and Taylor met in the final. Part took a 4–1 lead but Taylor hit back to take the lead, 5–4. At 6–6 Part held his nerve and beat Taylor 7–6 to end Taylor&#x27;s eight tournament unbeaten run in the championship. Taylor&#x27;s other losses to Part came in the 2003 Las Vegas Desert Classic (13–10 in the semi-final), the 2004 UK Open (8–6 in the quarter-final) and at the 2005 World Matchplay (16–11 in the quarter-final).

Part won the 2008 PDC World Championship and became the second player after Taylor to have won the tournament more than once. Taylor and Part met in competition on at least 37 occasions, with Taylor winning 31 and Part winning 6.

===Raymond van Barneveld===
van Barneveld switched to the PDC in 2006. Their first clash came in the 2006 Premier League Darts tournament and ended in a 7–7 draw. The return match went in Taylor&#x27;s favour. Barneveld&#x27;s first PDC win over Taylor came at the 2006 UK Open with an 11–10 quarter-final success, which he followed up with success in the semi-finals of the Las Vegas Desert Classic, winning by four sets to three. Taylor later defeated van Barneveld by three sets to one in the World Grand Prix.

They then met in the final of the 2007 PDC World Championship at the Circus Tavern. The match has been described as the greatest game in the history of darts. Taylor was defeated by van Barneveld seven sets to six in a sudden-death leg. Taylor responded to his loss by defeating van Barneveld on two occasions in the 2007 Premier League Darts and beating him in the final of the inaugural US Open. Van Barneveld later defeated Taylor in the quarter-finals of the UK Open by 11 legs to four. Taylor lost his top spot in the PDC World Rankings to van Barneveld in January 2008, but regained it in June.

In major PDC tournaments in 2008, Taylor defeated van Barneveld twice in the Premier League, lost by 10 legs to nine in the quarter-finals of the UK Open, but won the World Grand Prix against his rival by six sets to two. The rivalry continued into 2009 with the two meeting in the World Championship final for a second time, with Taylor winning 7–1 with a 110.94 three-dart average. The two then met in the 2010 World Matchplay final; Taylor won 18–12, averaging more than 105, which was higher than van Barneveld&#x27;s 100.11 average. After the game Barneveld acknowledged &quot;I&#x27;m the number two at the moment, and players like James Wade, Simon Whitlock and Gary Anderson are all trying but he&#x27;s just too good for everyone&quot;. The first win for Van Barneveld in a televised tournament after the 2008 UK Open came almost six years later. In the 2014 Premier League Darts the pair met three times. Twice during the league states, with both matches ending in a draw. Then, in the semi-finals they met again. After an early 4–1 lead for Taylor, the match turned around and Van Barneveld won the match 8–5 to claim his first televised victory against Taylor in more than six years. Van Barneveld defeated Taylor in both their league encounters in the 2015 Premier League, winning 7–4 and 7–2, with Taylor hitting a 115.80 average in the former. In the 2017 World Championship van Barneveld defeated Taylor in the quarter-final. Taylor and van Barneveld met in competition on at least 83 occasions, with Taylor winning 61 and van Barneveld winning 18, with 4 draws.

===James Wade===
James Wade has won nine PDC major titles since he burst onto the scene in 2006. Wade handed Taylor his first defeat in a Premier League match in 2008. Another major win for Wade against Taylor was in the final of Championship League Darts 2010. The quarter-finals of the 2014 World Grand Prix was the first time Wade defeated Taylor in a televised knockout match. They have met in the final of the World Matchplay four times in 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2012 with Taylor victorious each time. In the 2014 Masters, Wade knocked out Taylor in the semi-final en route to winning the tournament. In the 2015 World Matchplay Wade broke Taylor&#x27;s 38 match winning streak at the Winter Gardens by defeating Taylor 17–14 in the semi-final. Taylor and Wade met in competition on at least 71 occasions, with Taylor winning 51 and Wade winning 14, with 6 draws.

===Adrian Lewis===
During the early part of Adrian Lewis&#x27; career until 2007, he was Taylor&#x27;s protégé having practised together in their home city Stoke-on-Trent and made his television debut in 2004, aged 19, at the UK Open. However, Lewis has kicked on since then and has amassed four PDC major titles including two consecutive World titles in 2011 and 2012. The pair have been part of what has been a feisty rivalry at times. Taylor beat Lewis 5–0 in the World Championship quarterfinal in 2010. They met again in October 2010 in the World Grand Prix semi-final. Lewis would win that encounter five sets to four. Lewis and Taylor have met in four PDC major finals during their rivalry. These have included the finals of the 2008 and 2011 European Championship which Taylor won 11–5 and 11–8 respectively, the final of the 2013 Masters which Taylor won 10–1, as well as the final of the 2013 World Matchplay where Taylor averaged 111.23 and won 18–13. The latter involved Lewis playing in his first Matchplay final where he averaged 105.92 and hit 19 maximums. Taylor and Lewis met in competition on at least 74 occasions, with Taylor winning 55 and Lewis winning 17, with 2 draws.

===Michael van Gerwen===
In 2013, Michael van Gerwen became the world number two behind Taylor and was tipped to take over Taylor&#x27;s dominance of the sport. The pair&#x27;s first meeting saw Taylor win 3–2 when the Dutchman was 17 years old, before van Gerwen beat him 3–0 in the Masters of Darts and 7–6 in the International Darts League. Taylor then won 15 consecutive games against him encompassing a span of five years, during which van Gerwen struggled for form and confidence.

However, in October 2012 van Gerwen won his first PDC major and when the two met in the last 16 of the 2012 Grand Slam of Darts, the match was billed as a clash between the two best players in the world. It was this match which truly started the rivalry as both players averaged more than 110 for long parts of it, with Taylor at one point gesturing for van Gerwen to get out of his way when he paused in retrieving his darts. Van Gerwen took the match 10–5 with it being signalled as the start of a new era in darts. The two then met in a Players Championship final with van Gerwen coming back from 5–4 down with back to back finishes of 164 and 124 to win in a final against Taylor for the first time.

At the 2013 World Championship, the two met in the final, where Taylor fought back from 2–0 and 4–2 down in sets to win 7–4. Van Gerwen averaged between 105 and 108 in the early sets but as his average dropped, Taylor&#x27;s average reached 103, winning five successive sets to claim his 16th title over a rival he admitted in the post-match interview was &#x27;hard to crack&#x27;.

A few months later, van Gerwen became the first player other than Taylor to finish top of the table of the Premier League with the two meeting in the final which van Gerwen won 10–8. Afterwards Van Gerwen called Taylor the greatest and said that no one will match his achievements in darts.

Taylor then won the next three high-profile meetings which included the finals of the Sydney Darts Masters and Championship League Darts. Taylor had won six major titles since the Premier League loss, whilst Van Gerwen hadn&#x27;t won any until they met in the final of the 2013 Players Championship Finals. Van Gerwen won seven successive legs from 6–3 down before emerging victorious 11–7.

In January 2014, Van Gerwen won the World Championship and replaced Taylor as the world number one, and a month later inflicted the first whitewash over Taylor in Premier League history by beating him 7–0 in 13 minutes with an average of 109.59. Van Gerwen whitewashed Taylor 4–0 in the final of the World Cup, en route to the Netherlands&#x27; 3–0 win over England. In July, they contested the final of the World Matchplay; Taylor won 11 of the first 13 legs and went on to win 18–9, averaging 107.27. The loss reduced Van Gerwen to tears on the stage afterwards. In August, the pair met in the final of the inaugural Perth Darts Masters with Taylor fighting back from 6–3 down in legs to win 11–9 whilst averaging 105.08.

At the 2016 Masters van Gerwen became the first player to win 5 matches in a row against Taylor. Taylor defeated Van Gerwen 11–5 in the final of the inaugural Champions League of Darts tournament in September 2016, having defeated him 10–4 in an earlier group match. When Taylor retired, he had played Van Gerwen 62 times, winning 34 and losing 26, with 2 draws. Taylor won 6 of his last 9 matches against Van Gerwen before his retirement.

==Nickname==
Taylor had the nickname &quot;The Crafty Potter&quot; in the early 1990s, reflecting his status as the protégé of Eric Bristow (who was nicknamed &quot;The Crafty Cockney&quot;) and his job in the ceramic industry. However, Taylor soon achieved success in his own right. In July 1995, Taylor was given the nickname &quot;The Power&quot; by Sky Sports production manager, Peter Judge, during the 1995 World Matchplay in Blackpool. Judge told Taylor that he should have a nickname and &quot;The Power&quot; became the serendipitous choice after Judge stepped on an empty CD case of Snap!&#x27;s &quot;The Power&quot;.

==Outside darts==

=== Personal life ===
Taylor&#x27;s father Douglas died from bowel cancer in 1997, aged 57, and his mother Elizabeth died from a lung condition in 2015, aged 74. Taylor and his former wife Yvonne, who married in 1988, separated in 2011 and divorced in 2016. They have four children together, three daughters and a son. In 2015, their two youngest daughters were reported to be estranged from Taylor and living on state benefits following the breakdown of their parents&#x27; marriage. One daughter, then aged 26, was reported to be unemployed and living in a hostel in Stoke-on-Trent that was also used by prostitutes and drug addicts. Their youngest daughter, then aged 22, was reported to be pregnant with her fourth child and living in a council house. Both daughters claimed that Taylor, while continuing to support his two oldest children financially, had refused their requests for assistance. During divorce hearings in 2016, Taylor&#x27;s net worth was estimated at £3.4 million.

Taylor&#x27;s 2003 autobiography, &quot;The Power&quot;, was ghostwritten by the late Sky TV darts commentator Sid Waddell. He was inducted into the Stoke-on-Trent Hall of Fame when it was opened in January 2011. He is a supporter of Port Vale F.C.

===Indecent assault conviction===
On 10 October 1999, after an exhibition match at a hotel in Leslie, Fife, Taylor offered two intoxicated 23-year-old women a lift home in his campervan, driven by a hired driver. Both women subsequently accused him of indecent assault. He denied the charges, but the matter became public knowledge in March 2001 after he was found guilty in Dunfermline Sheriff Court. One of the women testified that Taylor had tried to kiss her and unzip her trousers, before unhooking her bra and touching her breasts. The second woman testified that Taylor had put his hands down her shirt and touched her breasts beneath her bra. The women clarified that they had both verbally and physically objected to being touched. At the sentencing in May 2001, the Sheriff commented that the offences were not serious enough to merit a custodial sentence, but she fined Taylor £2,000. 

As a result of his conviction, Taylor&#x27;s Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) nomination from the 2001 New Year Honours was annulled before he was awarded it. Both of Taylor&#x27;s youngest daughters later claimed that they had been bullied at school over the incident. His youngest daughter claimed that this bullying had resulted in her leaving school without any academic qualifications.

===Television and music appearances===
Taylor&#x27;s achievements in darts have led to guest appearances on television.

He also appeared in Justin Hawkins&#x27; solo project British Whale&#x27;s music video for a cover of the Sparks song, &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for the Both of Us&quot;.

He made several appearances on the ITV game show &quot;Bullseye&quot;, hosted by comedian Jim Bowen and professional darts commentator Tony Green.

He has appeared on several BBC television shows over the years.

On 2 February 2009, he made a guest cameo appearance in ITV&#x27;s long-running popular soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, playing the part of &#x27;Disco Dave&#x27;, the captain of a rival darts team to the Rovers Return.

On 22 January 2011 he appeared to present the award for Best Comedy Panel Show at the British Comedy Awards hosted by Jonathan Ross.

On 1 January 2012, Taylor appeared on &quot;OMG! Jedward&#x27;s Dream Factory&quot;, an Irish children&#x27;s reality television show which pop duo Jedward helped to fulfil the wishes of children who have previously written in to the show. An episode featured a girl named Laura, a darts fan who wrote into the show wanting to meet and play darts with Taylor. It was recorded in 2011 when the World Grand Prix was in Dublin.

On 12 March 2012, Taylor made a guest appearance on &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;.

In May 2012, Taylor, together with the seven other players who competed in the Premier League, recorded a charity single with Chas Hodges and his band called &quot;Got My Tickets for the Darts&quot; which was written by Chas.

Rob Cross is the only player with a winning record against Taylor, having faced him once in the 2018 World Championship final. Taylor has a 56.67% win rate against Michael van Gerwen, the player with the most victories against him.

On 9 January 2007, Taylor won the 2006 PDC Player of the Year award at the inaugural PDC Awards Dinner held at the Dorchester Hotel in London&#x27;s Park Lane. He was one of ten nominees for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 2006; the award went to Zara Phillips.

<doc id="409346" wikidata="Q3519841" url="?curid=409346" title="The Atlantics">
<text>The Atlantics are an Australian surf band founded in 1961. Initially, the band line-up consisted of drummer Peter Hood, bassist Bosco Bosanac, Theo Penglis on lead and rhythm guitar, and guitarist Eddy Matzenik. Matzenik was replaced by Jim Skaithitis while the band was still in its earliest stages, long before the band recorded or released albums. The band&#x27;s claim to fame was as Australia&#x27;s most successful of the genre. Most well known for their classic hit, &quot;Bombora&quot;, their later recordings such as &quot;Come On&quot; are examples of 1960s garage rock. They were the first Australian rock band to write their own hits. In 2000 the group reformed with three of the original members, and continue to release new material and perform in concert. In 2013 the group celebrated the 50th Anniversary of their first album, &quot;Bombora&quot; and the eponymous single that was their first to chart. A European tour was organised to mark the occasion.

&#x27;Bombora&#x27; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry in 2013.

Note: There was a rock band in the Boston, Massachusetts area also called the Atlantics in the mid-1970s and early 1980s; songs of theirs included &quot;Weekend&quot;, &quot;When You&#x27;re Young&quot;, and &quot;Lonelyhearts&quot;. They had an album on ABC Records called &quot;Big City Rock&quot;.

==History==
Formed in the southern beachside suburbs of Sydney, Australia in 1961, the group began performing locally, and soon gained a following. Contrary to the accepted surfing connotations of their name they actually took their name from a local brand of petrol, Atlantic. In early 1962 they appeared on a local television talent show &quot;New Faces&quot;, where they were voted &quot;Most Promising Group of 1962.&quot; They signed a deal with booking agent Joan King, who convinced the members to quit their day jobs and produce a demo, which she shopped to a variety of record labels. After several rejections, they were signed to CBS Records in 1963. The A&amp;R representative for CBS, Sven Libaek, was especially impressed by the group&#x27;s original compositions. Most Australian instrumental rock bands at the time merely aped and covered material from The Shadows or, to a lesser extent, The Ventures. The Atlantics had the advantage of having twin lead guitarists, both highly proficient on solo work and both capable of pushing the band along with a driving rhythm. It was this, together with the band members&#x27; European cultural influences (largely Greek with some Yugoslav and Hungarian - all members came to Australia as child migrants) that gave their music that passionate edge over other local bands of their day.

In February 1963, CBS released the first single, &quot;Moon Man&quot; b/w &quot;Dark Eyes&quot;. &quot;Moon Man&quot; was an original song written by Peter Hood, and &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; was a traditional tune reinterpreted by the band. While the single was not a hit, it did gain enough attention for CBS to agree to continue to support the group.

===Riding the surf music wave===
By this time the surfing music craze had reached Australia&#x27;s shores and a host of local bands such as The Statesmen, Jimmy D &amp; the Starlighters (a.k.a. Jimmy D &amp; the Jaguars), The Midnighters, The Telstars, Dave Bridge Trio, The Joy Boys and The Denvermen were all releasing surfing titled instrumental tracks, and in particular, The Denvermen&#x27;s evocative ballad &quot;Surfside&quot;, which had topped Australia&#x27;s charts in February 1963.

In July 1963, The Atlantics released the single that would become their biggest hit, most well-known song and one which remains a classic of its genre to this day. &quot;Bombora&quot; was written by Hood and Skiathitis, and was named after an Aboriginal term for large waves breaking over submerged rock shelves. The B-side was the old traditional English song &quot;Greensleeves&quot;. By September 1963, &quot;Bombora&quot; had climbed the Australian charts to reach No 1. It was released in Japan, Italy, Netherlands, UK and New Zealand and in South America. It was nominated as record of the week by US &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine and reached No 2 on the Italian charts (where there was even a vocal version released). As well the song was covered by a number of overseas bands. This overseas success made The Atlantics Australia&#x27;s first internationally recognised rock act. October 1963 saw the release of their first LP album, &quot;Bombora&quot;. They released three more albums from 1963 to 1965. On stage the band maintained their reputation at concerts and beachside surf clubs with an exciting, pounding sound combined with a stage act that included them all playing their guitars behind their heads and Penglis and Skiathitis on opposite sides of the stage swapping lead lines with one another.

In November 1963, they released the follow-up, another similar thundering surf instrumental, &quot;The Crusher&quot; which, while not quite as successful as &quot;Bombora&quot;, still made a respectable dent in the Australian charts.

Their fourth single, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; however was a total break with the surf sound. Released in March 1964, it was unlike any other of their tracks, or indeed any other instrumentals of the day. A bold and ambitious attempt at a mini Sci-Fi space opera, it had a dramatic build-up intro, tempo changes and dynamic changes. It was way ahead of its time. It featured a battle in space using echo and guitar effects, the like of which would not be heard until Hendrix came along some years later. Disappointingly for the band, many DJ&#x27;s refused to play it and it failed to make most charts.

By this time The Beatles and the Merseybeat sound had arrived and instrumentals were becoming rather passé. The Atlantics continued to release a number of instrumental singles with titles such as &quot;Rumble and Run&quot; and &quot;Giant&quot; until July 1965. However, none of these achieved any commercial success, and did not chart. Their record contract with CBS ended. During 1965 they undertook a far-Eastern tour including Japan.

===New image and style===
In 1965, the band members reinvented themselves. They set up their own production company JRA productions. They exchanged their suits and thin ties for casual shirts, T-shirts and jeans and grew their hair long, guitarist Theo Penglis switched to keyboards and they added a vocalist, Johnny Rebb. Rebb had been a rock star in Australia in his own right in the late 1950s. Indeed, he had at one time been known as the &quot;Gentleman of Rock&quot;. With Johnny on vocals they proceeded to release a number of tough sounding singles starting with a hard rockin&#x27; revival of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; and Bo Diddley&#x27;s, R &#x27;n B, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Judge A Book By Its Cover&quot;. They recorded songs with a variety of styles between 1965 and 1970 including a cover of The Beau Brummels&#x27; top 40 hit &quot;You Tell Me Why&quot; with 12 string guitar hook &amp; harmonies, and an instrumental, &quot;Take A Trip,&quot; under the pseudonym band name as The Gift of Love. However they only succeeded chart-wise with a version of Screaming Jay Hawkins &quot;I Put A Spell on You&quot;, which reached No. 29 on the Sydney chart in 1966. In 1967 they put out the song that is now widely regarded as a classic punk/garage track, Peter Hood&#x27;s &quot;Come On&quot;. During this time, Rebb continued to release a number of singles under his own name with The Atlantics backing him. They also provided backing on a string of singles for Russ Kruger, Rebb&#x27;s brother, and female singer Kelly Green. It was during this time that The Atlantics started their own independent label, Ramrod. They were one of the first Australian bands to set up their own independent label. From September 1967 all their recordings and all those for the above artists were released on their Ramrod label. As well they put out recordings by other bands such as The Motivation.

===More changes after 1970===

Around 1970 the &quot;classic&quot; lineup ceased to regularly perform live. They started their own recording studio, Atlantic studio (no connection with the U.S. company Atlantic Records), in the Sydney suburb of Earlwood. Run by Peter Hood, this studio was to operate continuously right through into the 1990s, recording a wide variety of music from advertising jingles to country music to heavy metal bands and at one point even produced a single there for visiting Hollywood actress, Brooke Shields. Bosco Bosanac went into country music and switched to pedal steel guitar. He formed a band with Anglo-American country singer Mike Fox and produced two albums for him. Fox won a Golden Guitar as the best new talent award for 1978 at Australia&#x27;s annual prestigious Tamworth Country Music Festival for his song &quot;If Nobody Loves You&quot;, which came from his first album. Theo Penglis played lead guitar and piano on this track. Bosco then went to form country rock band Shotgun. Theo Penglis is currently playing piano with Fifties Rock and Roll Band &quot;Rave On&quot;. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Haanstra also played lead guitar in both Mike Fox &amp; The Tennessee Ramblers and Shotgun. Bob now resides in southern NSW and teaches guitar, whilst Bosco Bosanac now performs around Australia in a Johnny Cash Review.

===&quot;The Flight of the Surf Guitar&quot;===
Over the years The Atlantics have re-emerged sporadically. In 1986–1988, Skiathitis, Hood, and Bosanac went on tour with replacement guitarist Brian Burns and drummer Paul Greene. In 1999 the three reformed on a more permanent basis with guitarist Martin Cilia. They have since released three albums, beginning with &quot;The Flight of the Surf Guitar&quot;. They are in the forefront of a new interest in the surf rock music instrumental genre. They have done a number of tours including appearing on Australia&#x27;s &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot; 1950s and 1960s rock revival shows, ABC-TV show &quot;Studio 22&quot;, and &quot;Bombora&quot; was used in the closing ceremony at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. They continue to perform live. On 2 December 2006 they appeared live, playing &quot;Bombora&quot; on the ABC Television show &quot;Delightful Rain&quot;, a celebration of four decades of Australian surf rock music. Bosanac had left the band in May that year, just weeks before The Atlantics were invited by Bombora Creative MD David Minear to be a part of the Delightful Rain project, with Michael Smith, the former bass player for Adelaide band Scandal and writer and editor for &quot;Drum Media&quot; magazine, replacing him. In November 2009, Bombora Creative released a DVD, &quot;The Atlantics Live at Freshwater&quot;, of an impromptu performance the band did at the end of their recording sessions for Delightful Rain.

<text>The Independence Party ( ) is a conservative political party in Iceland. It is current the second largest party in the Alþingi, with 14 seats. The chairman of the party is Bjarni Benediktsson and the vice chairman of the party is Þórdís Kolbrún R. Gylfadóttir.

It was formed in 1929 through a merger of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party. This united the two parties advocating the dissolution of the Union of Denmark and Iceland; dissolution was achieved in 1944, during the German occupation of Denmark. Since its formation in 1929, the party has won the largest share of the vote in every election except 2009 and 2024, when it fell behind the Social Democratic Alliance. Every Independence Party leader has also at some point held the office of Prime Minister. Since 1983 there have been only two governments that have excluded the Independence Party — the second cabinet of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir from 2009–2013, and the sitting government of Kristrún Frostadóttir.

On fiscal issues, the Independence Party is economically liberal, favouring privatisation, and opposed to interventionism. Positioned ideologically on the centre-right of the political spectrum, the party is most strongly supported by fishermen and high-income earners. A longstanding member of the International Democracy Union, in September 2023 the party obtained associate member status in the European People&#x27;s Party.

==History==
Established on 25 May 1929, the Independence Party was founded through a merger of the Conservative Party (1924) and the Liberal Party (1925). It readopted the name of the historical Independence Party, which had split between the Conservatives and Liberals in 1927. The fusion of the Icelandic conservative and liberal parties resulted in the ascension of the Independence Party to prominence, firmly establishing it as the primary non-socialist force in Scandinavian politics. From its first election, in 1931, it was the largest party in Iceland. 

The Independence Party won the 2007 elections, increasing their seat tally in the Althing by three. It formed a new coalition government under Geir Haarde with the Social Democratic Alliance, after the Progressive Party lost heavily in the elections. In the 2009 elections, the party dropped from 25–26 to 16 seats in the Althing, becoming Iceland&#x27;s second-largest party following the Social Democratic Alliance (which gained two seats, to 20.)

The Independence Party re-entered government after the general elections in 2013, gaining 19 seats in parliament and the most votes again becoming Iceland&#x27;s largest party. The Independence Party hence formed a majority government with the Progressive Party with Bjarni becoming Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs under the premiership of Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson chairman of the Progressive Party. The government coalition was ended after the Panama Papers revealed that Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, Bjarni Benediktsson and other known members of the Independence Party held funds in offshore bank accounts. The general election in 2016 yielded a government consisting of the Independence Party, Bright Future and Viðreisn. With the Independence Party holding 21 seats in Parliament. That government then proceeded to fall apart due to Bjarni Benediktsson&#x27;s father&#x27;s ties to a convicted child sex offender that had his criminal records cleared by the Minister of the interior, an Independence Party MP. After the general elections 2017, called after much backlash from this decision, the Independence party formed a new government with the Left-Green Movement and the Progressive Party. The Independence Party had 17 seats in Parliament.

After the 2021 parliamentary election, the new government was, just like the previous government, a tri-party coalition of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party and the Left-Green Movement, headed by Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir of Left-Green Movement. In April 2024, Bjarni Benediktsson replaced Katrín Jakobsdóttir as prime minister. Shortly thereafter, the Left-Green Movement pulled out of the government, and new elections were held in November of 2024. The Independence Party received its worst result ever, returning just 14 representatives to the Althing on just 19% of the vote, both the lowest totals in party history. Due to the fractured opposition, however, the Independence Party still finished second in terms of total votes and total seats.

==Ideology and platform==
The Independence Party has been described as conservative, liberal-conservative, and conservative-liberal.

The party has been the sole major politically right-leaning party in Iceland since its inception, and has captured a broad cross-section of centre-right voters. As a result, the party is not as far to the right as most right-wing parties in other Nordic countries, serving as a &#x27;catch-all&#x27; party. The party, like the British Conservatives, states a claim to be primarily &#x27;pragmatic&#x27;, as opposed to ideological, and its name is seen as an allusion to being independent of dogma (with the original meaning, promoting independence from Denmark, having been achieved long ago). For most of its period of political dominance, the party has relied upon coalition government, and has made coalitions with many major parties in parliament.

The Independence Party has generally been economically liberal and advocated limited government intervention in the economy. It was originally committed to laissez-faire economics, but shifted its economic policies leftwards in the 1930s, accepting the creation of a welfare state.

The party is liberal concerning social issues and has historically been less conservative than other centre-right parties in Scandinavia. The party was the only consistent advocate for the end of prohibition of beer, and provided three-quarters of voters in favour of legalisation; the ban was lifted in 1989.

==Organisation and support==

Historically, the party has been the most successful liberal conservative party in the Nordic countries. It has a broad base of support, but is most strongly supported by Iceland&#x27;s large fishing community and by businesses. The Independence Party support is mostly found in the South and Southwest.

The Independence Party has always attempted to avoid appealing to a specific social class. As such, the party is relatively successful at attracting working-class voters, which partly comes from the party&#x27;s strong advocacy of independence in the 1930s. However, most of its strength is in the middle class, and the party is disproportionately supported by those on high incomes and those with university educations.

The party has long been endorsed by &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot;, an Icelandic newspaper of record. Davíð Oddsson, Iceland&#x27;s longest-serving Prime Minister and former leader of the Independence Party, is one of two editors of the paper. The party was also historically supported by the afternoon newspaper &quot;Vísir&quot;, now part of &quot;DV&quot;.

The party has a tradition of individualism and strong personalities, which has proven difficult for the leadership to manage. The Commonwealth Party split in 1941, while the Republican Party left in 1953, both in opposition to the leftwards shift of the party away from classical liberalism. Neither splinter group managed to get seats in Althingi and both vanished quickly. The Citizens&#x27; Party split from the party in 1983, but collapsed in 1994.

Its youth wing, Young Independents, is by far the largest youth organisation in Iceland, with over 12,000 members. It is slightly more classically liberal than the senior party.

The party has a very large membership base, with 15% of the total population being a member of the party.

==International relations==

For years, the Independence party has been a member of the International Democracy Union; the Union includes members such as the Conservative Party (Norway), Moderate Party (Sweden), The Republicans (France), the National Coalition Party (Finland), and the Christian Democratic Union (Germany). In 2011, the party joined the European Conservatives and Reformists Party, a centre-right Eurosceptic political organisation, but withdrew in 2021. In September 2023, it joined the pro-EU European People&#x27;s Party as an associate member.

<text>In mathematics, a primorial prime is a prime number of the form &quot;pn&quot;# ± 1, where &quot;pn&quot;# is the primorial of &quot;pn&quot; (i.e. the product of the first &quot;n&quot; primes).

Primality tests show that:

: &quot;pn&quot;# − 1 is prime for &quot;n&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 24, 66, 68, 167, 287, 310, 352, 564, 590, 620, 849, 1552, 1849, 67132, 85586, 234725, 334023, 435582, 446895, ... . (&quot;pn&quot; = 3, 5, 11, 13, 41, 89, 317, 337, 991, 1873, 2053, 2377, 4093, 4297, 4583, 6569, 13033, 15877, 843301, 1098133, 3267113, 4778027, 6354977, 6533299, ... )
: &quot;pn&quot;# + 1 is prime for &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 75, 171, 172, 384, 457, 616, 643, 1391, 1613, 2122, 2647, 2673, 4413, 13494, 31260, 33237, 304723, 365071, 436504, 498865, ... . (&quot;pn&quot; = 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 31, 379, 1019, 1021, 2657, 3229, 4547, 4787, 11549, 13649, 18523, 23801, 24029, 42209, 145823, 366439, 392113, 4328927, 5256037, 6369619, 7351117, ..., )

The first term of the third sequence is 0 because &quot;p&quot;0# = 1 (we also let &quot;p&quot;0 = 1, see Prime_number#Primality_of_one, hence the first term of the fourth sequence is 1) is the empty product, and thus &quot;p&quot;0# + 1 = 2, which is prime. Similarly, the first term of the first sequence is not 1 (hence the first term of the second sequence is also not 2), because &quot;p&quot;1# = 2, and 2 − 1 = 1 is not prime.

The first few primorial primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 29, 31, 211, 2309, 2311, 30029, 200560490131, 304250263527209, 23768741896345550770650537601358309 .

, the largest known prime of the form &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;# − 1 is 6533299# − 1 (&quot;n&quot; = 446,895) with 2,835,864 digits, found by the PrimeGrid project.

, the largest known prime of the form &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;# + 1 is 7351117# + 1 (&quot;n&quot; = 498,865) with 3,191,401 digits, also found by the PrimeGrid project.

Euclid&#x27;s proof of the infinitude of the prime numbers is commonly misinterpreted as defining the primorial primes, in the following manner:

: Assume that the first &quot;n&quot; consecutive primes including 2 are the only primes that exist. If either &quot;pn&quot;# + 1 or &quot;pn&quot;# − 1 is a primorial prime, it means that there are larger primes than the &quot;n&quot;th prime (if neither is a prime, that also proves the infinitude of primes, but less directly; each of these two numbers has a remainder of either &quot;p&quot; − 1 or 1 when divided by any of the first &quot;n&quot; primes, and hence all its prime factors are larger than &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;).

<doc id="409350" wikidata="Q1141127" url="?curid=409350" title="Social Democratic Alliance">
<text>The Social Democratic Alliance (, ) is a social democratic political party in Iceland. The party is positioned on the centre-left of the political spectrum and their leader is Kristrún Frostadóttir, who has been leader since 2022, and has served as Prime Minister of Iceland since 21 December 2024.

Founded in 2000 as a merger of four centre-left parties, the party formed its first government following the 2009 Icelandic parliamentary election under Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir. The party was defeated in 2013, and remained in opposition until winning the 2024 elections.

The youth wing of the Social Democratic Alliance is the Social Democratic Youth.

== History ==
In 1999, four centre-left political parties (the National Awakening, the People&#x27;s Alliance, the Social Democratic Party and the Women&#x27;s List) agreed to form a joint run by all parties in the 1999 Icelandic parliamentary election. The vision of the party was to unite the left-wing of Icelandic politics, which had been fractured since the 1930 split of the Social Democratic Party, and present a united bloc to oppose the ruling Independence Party. The leader of the alliance at the 1999 election was Margrét Frímannsdóttir. The alliance elected 17 MPs and finished second in terms of total votes, but still finished some way behind the dominant Independence Party.

The parties then formally merged in May 2000 under the name The Alliance (&quot;Samfylkingin&quot;). The first leader of the unified party was Össur Skarphéðinsson. The merger was a deliberate attempt to unify the entire Icelandic centre-left into one political party capable of countering the centre-right Independence Party. However, the initial attempt failed as a group of Althing representatives rejected the new party&#x27;s platform, which was inspired by that of UK Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s centrist New Labour, and broke away before the merger to found the Left-Green Movement, a party based on more traditional democratic socialist values as well as Euroscepticism and green politics. 

In the 2003 parliamentary election, the party improved on its 1999 showing, electing 20 MPs and finishing with just 3% less of the total vote share than the Independence Party. The party fell back some in the 2007 Icelandic parliamentary election under Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, winning 18 seats, as the Left-Green Movement began eating into their left-leaning voter base. However, the Alliance did enter government for the first time after the 2007 election, forming a grand coalition in supporting the government of Independence Party Prime Minister Geir Haarde. The Alliance received the portfolios for the Ministries of Commerce, Foreign Affairs, Social Affairs, Communications, Industry, and the Environment.

The Icelandic Movement – Living Country merged into the party in March 2009.

In the snap 2009 parliamentary election called in the aftermath of the Icelandic financial crisis, the Social Democratic Alliance under the leadership of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the Left-Green Movement, which was the country&#x27;s first majority left-wing government. She was the country’s first female prime minister and the world’s first openly gay head of government.

In February 2013, the official name of the party was changed to The Alliance – Social Democratic Party of Iceland ().

The party lost substantial support in the 2013 parliamentary election, its first under new leader Árni Páll Árnason who replaced Jóhanna in February of that year. The party fell from first to third largest in Alþingi. It fell back further at the 2016 parliamentary election, under new leader Oddný G. Harðardóttir, where it polled 5.7% and elected only three MPs. Oddný resigned after the election, and was replaced by Logi Már Einarsson.

In the 2017 parliamentary election, the party rebounded some by winning seven seats on 12.1% of the vote. However, the party lost one of their seats and received 9.9% of the vote in the 2021 parliamentary election. Logi led the party in both of these elections, becoming the first Alliance leader to contest two elections. He stepped down after the disappointing results in 2021, and was replaced by Kristrún Frostadóttir in 2022, who remains the current chair of the party.

In the 2024 parliamentary election under new leader Kristrún, the party won 15 seats on 20.8% of the vote, the largest party in both seats and vote share. President Halla Tómasdóttir gave the Social Democratic Alliance the first mandate to form a government, and Kristrún became Prime Minister in a government led by the Social Democratic Alliance and supported by Viðreisn and the People&#x27;s Party. With Kristrún as Prime Minister and Halla as President, it was the first time in history Iceland had women in both offices simultaneously. The two junior coalition partners in Kristrún&#x27;s government are also led by women.

In 2014, it became the largest party in the Reykjavík City Council, and party member Dagur B. Eggertsson became mayor. Since 2018 it has been the second largest party in the City Council after the Independence Party, but the Alliance is part of the governing coalition of Progressive Party mayor Einar Þorsteinsson.

<text>Charlotte Irene Caffey (born October 21, 1953) is an American guitarist and pianist, best known for her work in the rock band the Go-Go&#x27;s in the 1980s, including writing &quot;We Got the Beat&quot;.

==Career==
Caffey began her musical career playing bass guitar in the early Los Angeles punk band The Eyes before joining the Go-Go&#x27;s in 1978 and switching to guitar. She remained friends with fellow band member Belinda Carlisle after the initial breakup of the Go-Go&#x27;s and wrote songs for Carlisle&#x27;s solo albums.

From 1988 until 1992, she led her own band, The Graces, with Meredith Brooks and Gia Ciambotti, who released the album &quot;Perfect View&quot; in 1989. Caffey also co-wrote the theme song to the television series &quot;Clueless&quot; with Anna Waronker, and played piano on the album version of &quot;Foolish Games&quot; by Jewel, as well as co-writing the No. 1 U.S. country hit &quot;But for the Grace of God&quot; with Keith Urban.

Caffey wrote the book, music, and lyrics for &quot;&quot; with Anna Waronker. The rock musical debuted at the Hayworth Theatre in Los Angeles in 2008. A new production of &quot;Lovelace: A Rock Musical&quot; made its United Kingdom debut at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2010. A number of her songs were featured in the 2018 debut of the Broadway musical &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, with a story suggested by Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; set to the songs of the Go-Go&#x27;s and Belinda Carlisle.

The Go-Go&#x27;s announced an 11-date reunion tour scheduled to begin in June 2020; however, in May 2020 the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2021 it was announced that The Go-Go&#x27;s would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
The band confirmed plans for a 2022 UK tour with Billy Idol that would start in June 2022. The band was forced to postpone a short West Coast tour scheduled for the first week of January 2022 due to a COVID-19 case involving someone on the tour.

==Personal life==
She grew up in Glendale, California, and graduated from Immaculate Heart College. She is also in Ze Malibu Kids with her husband, the Redd Kross singer and guitarist Jeff McDonald. Their only child, a daughter named Astrid McDonald, was born in 1995 and is a singer and model.

She was the fourth of twelve children born to Ann (née Gorey) and Michael Caffey (died 2017), an American network television series episode director from the mid-1960s on into the 1990s (The Virginian, Dukes of Hazzard, Barnaby Jones, MacGyver, CHiPs, T.J. Hooker).

Charlotte semi-retired from regular performances in the late 1980s because of crippling carpal tunnel syndrome.

<text>This article lists political parties in Nauru.
In Nauru, political parties do not play a major role, as in many countries with parliamentary systems, but they have been formed. Officially, however, Nauru remains a non-party democracy.

As the parliamentary website puts it, &quot;Nauru does not have a political party system, so all members of Parliament are effectively independent members. Whilst it is usual for members to form groups, the absence of party discipline means that such groups have often been fluid and subject to change during the term of a Parliament&quot;.

<text>The Progressive Party (, FSF) is an agrarian political party in Iceland.

For most of its history, the Progressive Party has governed with the Independence Party. Since 30 November 2017, the party has been a coalition partner in the Bjarni Benediktsson government. The current chairman of the party is Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson who was elected on 2 October 2016. His predecessor was Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, who was elected on 18 January 2009 and was Prime Minister of Iceland from 23 May 2013 to 5 April 2016.

Throughout most of the 20th century, the party entered into coalitions with parties on both the Left and Right on the Icelandic political spectrum.

==History==

The Progressive Party was founded to represent Iceland&#x27;s farmer class, which went from being dominant from settlement to the late 19th century to rapidly dwindling in the early 20th century as a result of industrialization and urbanization. Its primary support still comes from the rural areas of Iceland and its policy roots still stem from its origin as an agrarian party, although it has since come to self-identify as a liberal party, though this is disputed outside of the party. It was founded in 1916 as a merger of two agrarian parties, the Farmers&#x27; Party (&quot;Bændaflokkur&quot;) and the Independent Farmers (&quot;Óháðir bændur&quot;). In 1956 the party almost agreed to an aborted merger with the Social Democratic Party. Throughout Iceland&#x27;s history as a self-governing and independent nation, the Progressive Party has most often been the second largest political party in the country. It has often joined government coalitions with either the Independence Party on the centre-right, or with centre-left parties. During the period 1927–1990, the Progressive Party held the prime minister post for thirty years and spent more than two-thirds of the time in coalition government.

=== 1970s ===
Following the 1971 parliamentary election, the Progressive Party formed a government with the People&#x27;s Alliance and Union of Liberals and Leftists, with Progressive Party chairman Ólafur Jóhannesson serving as prime minister.

The 1974 parliamentary election led to a coalition government of the Independence Party and Progressive Party led by Geir Hallgrímsson.

The 1978 parliamentary election returned Ólafur Jóhannesson to the role of prime minister, leading a coalition containing the Progressive Party, People&#x27;s Alliance and Social Democratic Party after two months of coalition negotiations.

The snap 1979 parliamentary election caused by the withdrawal of the Social Democrats from government led to a new government being formed in February 1980 by the Independence Party of Prime Minister Gunnar Thoroddsen, Progressive Party and People&#x27;s Alliance.

=== 1980s ===
The 1983 parliamentary election resulted in Progressive Party leader Steingrímur Hermannsson becoming prime minister in coalition with the Independence Party.

The 1987 parliamentary election in May saw a coalition being formed in July of that year led by Thorsteinn Pálsson of the Independence Party, with the Progressive Party and Social Democratic Party as junior partners. However, in September 1988, a new government was formed by the Progressive Party&#x27;s Steingrímur Hermannsson with the Social Democrats and People&#x27;s Alliance.

=== 1990s ===
Following the 1991 parliamentary election, the Progressive Party was in opposition, with the government being formed by Independence Party leader Davíð Oddsson.

In the 1995 parliamentary election, Davíð Oddsson remained as prime minister, with the Progressive Party returning to government as junior coalition partner to the Independence Party, a coalition which continued after the 1999 election.

=== 2000s ===
In the 2003 parliamentary election, the Progressive Party received 17.2% of the vote and 12 seats in the Althing. On 15 September 2004, Halldór Ásgrímsson of the Progressive Party took over as prime minister from Davíð Oddsson. Halldór Ásgrímsson announced his intention to resign on 5 June 2006 following the party&#x27;s poor results in the 2006 municipal elections. The coalition remained allied with the Independence Party chairman, Geir H. Haarde, as prime minister. The Progressive Party leader Jón Sigurðsson was Minister of Industry and Commerce, until a coalition of the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance took over after the elections in 2007.

In the 2007 parliamentary election, the party dropped five seats to hold only seven seats, down from twelve. The coalition only held a one-seat majority in the Althing, and the Independence Party formed a coalition government with the Social Democratic Alliance with the deal being signed on 22 May, returning the Progressive Party to the opposition. When a centre-left minority government was formed in February 2009, in the wake of the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis, the Progressive Party agreed to defend it from a no-confidence vote, but did not form part of the governing coalition.

In January 2009, it decided to change its party line on joining the European Union (EU) from being opposed to being in favour of EU accession, but with very strong caveats. The party later changed its policy to one of firm opposition to EU membership. In the wake of the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis, the Progressive Party became more populist. According to political scientist Eiríkur Bergmann, &quot;a completely renewed leadership took over the country’s old agrarian party, the Progressive Party (Framsóknarflokkurinn— PP), which was rapidly retuned in a more populist direction; geared against foreign creditors, international institutions and eventually partly towards anti- Muslim rhetoric, which until then had been absent in the country—there is no significant Muslim minority in Iceland. Under the new post-crisis leader- ship, the Progressive Party thus moved closer to populist parties in Europe.&quot;

In the 2009 parliamentary election, the Progressive Party fared somewhat better, securing 14.8% of the vote, and increasing its number of seats from seven to nine. It remained in opposition, however, with a centre-left coalition of the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement continuing to govern with an increased majority.

=== 2010s ===
In the 2013 parliamentary election, the Progressive Party reached second place nationally, winning 24.4% of the vote and 19 seats. Following the election, a centre-right coalition government was formed between the Progressive Party and Independence Party, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson of the Progressive Party appointed as prime minister. Sigmundur Davíð was ousted as leader of the party shortly after he was implicated in scandal and ethical quandaries in the Panama Papers release.

The Progressive Party split in 2017 when Sigmundur Davíð created his own party, the Centre Party (&quot;Miðflokkurinn&quot;).

=== 2020s ===

After the 2021 parliamentary election, the new government was, just like the previous government, a tri-party coalition of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party and the Left-Green Movement, headed by Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir of Left-Green Movement.

Historically, Nicaragua had a two-party system, with varying two dominant political parties.

Niger has a multi-party system, with two to three strong political parties and smaller parties electorally successful to take seats in the National Assembly. These smaller parties frequently enter into electoral coalitions with their more powerful opponents, forming blocs in both government and opposition.

==Party naming==
Nigerien political parties are commonly known both by their acronyms and a nickname. The latter tradition began prior to independence with the Nigerien Democratic Union-Sawaba. Sawaba (&quot;Freedom&quot; in Hausa) became the most common name of the party. Today all large parties have an official &quot;nickname&quot;, usually in Hausa, Djerma or other national languages, while the official party name is in French.

==Multi-party democracy==
Niger banned all opposition parties from 1959 (prior to independence) to 1991. During the First Republic (1960–1974), the PPN-RDA was the sole party. From 1987-1991, MNSD-Nassara was the only legal party. Both parties survive in somewhat altered forms.

<text>The Left-Green Movement (, ), also known by its short-form name Vinstri græn (VG), is an eco-socialist political party in Iceland.

Since the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary election, the party has had no members in the Althing. The party chairperson is Svandís Svavarsdóttir, the vice chair is Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, and the general secretary is Björg Eva Erlendsdóttir. 

The Left-Green Movement is a member of the Nordic Green Left Alliance.

== History ==
The party was founded in 1999 by members of Althing who did not approve of the merger of left-wing political parties in Iceland which resulted in the formation of the Social Democratic Alliance.

In the 1999 Icelandic parliamentary election, the Left-Green Movement took 9.1% of the vote and six seats in the Althing. The party had five members in the 63-seat Icelandic parliament after the 2003 Icelandic parliamentary election, where it polled 8.8% of the vote. After the 2007 Icelandic parliamentary election, the party had 9 seats in parliament, having received 14.3% of the vote.

After the 2009 Icelandic parliamentary election, the Left-Green Movement joined the first cabinet of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir as the minor partner to the centre-left Social Democratic Alliance after the previous coalition government of the Alliance and the centre-right Independence Party collapsed. In the 2009 Icelandic parliamentary election, it rose from nine seats to 14. With this, it became Iceland&#x27;s third-largest party (close behind the Independence Party) with 21.7% of the vote; this was the second largest outcome of a left-wing party in Iceland after the post-communist People&#x27;s Alliance in 1978, when it got 22.9% of the vote. The party gained one seat in addition, when a non-party parliamentarian joined the party. Later, three members of the parliamentary group have left the party. One joined the Nordic agrarian Progressive Party and two others became non-partisans. After the 2013 Icelandic parliamentary election, the party was in the opposition and had seven seats in the parliament. In the 2016 Icelandic parliamentary election, the party polled 15.9% of the vote and 10 seats in the Althing, becoming the second largest party, tied with the Pirates, after the Independence Party. However, after the collapse of the coalition government and snap parliamentary elections in 2017, the party increased its seats in parliament to 11 and became the second-largest party, forming a three-party coalition with the Independence Party and Progressive Party, and party chair Katrín Jakobsdóttir became the prime minister. The party lost three seats in the 2021 parliamentary elections, but stayed in government. After the 2021 parliamentary election, the new government was, just like the previous government, a tri-party coalition of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party and the Left-Green Movement, headed by Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir.

Katrín stepped down as prime minister and party leader to run for President of Iceland in the 2024 election, which she lost, coming in second place after Halla Tómasdóttir. She was replaced as prime minister by the Independence Party&#x27;s Bjarni Benediktsson. Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson became the interim party leader after Katrín. He returned to his position as vice-chairperson when Svandís Svavarsdóttir was elected as the new party leader in October of 2024. On 13 October, Bjarni announced that the government had collapsed due to disputes over foreign policy, asylum seekers, and energy, prompting him to call for a parliamentary election in November. Four days after the announcement, the Left-Green Movement withdrew from the government.

In the subsequent election, the Left-Green Movement lost all their seats.

== Ideology ==
The Left-Green Movement focuses on democratic socialist values, feminism, and environmentalism, as well as increased democracy and direct involvement of the people in the administration of the country. The party opposes Iceland&#x27;s involvement in NATO, and also the American invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. The party rejects membership of the European Union, and supports the Palestinian cause in the Middle East. It considers the mutual adaptation and integration of immigrants into Icelandic society as necessary.

<text>This is a list of [[political party|political parties]] in [[Nigeria]].

The Federal Republic of Nigeria has a multi-party system. The largest by National Assembly seats are the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). There are also a number of smaller parties, the largest of which are the Labour Party (LP), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and Young Progressives Party (YPP) including the African Democratic Congress (ADC), People&#x27;s Redemption Party (PRP), Social Democratic Party (SDP), and eleven other parties registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission.

==Current parties==
=== Parties represented in the National Assembly ===
=== Other parties represented in state assemblies ===
=== Extraparliamentary parties ===

=== Unregistered parties ===
These active (or recently active) parties are not currently registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission. After the 2019 elections, INEC deregistered 74 political parties for failing to &quot;satisfy the requirements&quot; of continued registration based on their poor performances during the elections. However, many of these parties are still organizationally active as the deregistration of 23 of the parties is being challenged in court as of 2022 while the complete deregistration Supreme Court case was only settled in May 2021. There are also prospective parties, like the revival of the Movement of the People, where there is yet to be a decision on their registration.

<text>This article lists political parties in Panama.

Panama has a multi-party system. Although there are three major political parties, no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

Parties with less than 30,000 members are not recognized by the Tribunal Electoral, and as a result, they are not able to participate in Panama&#x27;s general elections.

==The parties==
===Parliamentary parties===
The following are parliamentary parties.
===Other active parties===
*Communist Party of Panama
*MLN-29

===Defunct parties===
*Broad Front for Democracy
*Moral Vanguard of the Fatherland
*People&#x27;s Party of Panama
*Socialist Workers Front
*Workers Party (Marxist–Leninist)
*Independent Social Alternative Party

<text>The Liberal Party () was a liberal political party in Iceland. Its main issue was fisheries policy and it drew its main support from coastal villages.

The Liberal Party was founded by former Independence Party MP Sverrir Hermannsson in 1998. It was founded primarily in opposition to the fishing quota, and became a protest vote. In the following year&#x27;s election, the party won two seats out of 63. This climbed to four in 2003: a level that was maintained at the 2007 election. However, the party lost all its parliamentary representation in 2009, after a financial crisis hit the country.

The party was a strong supporter of the free market, against subsidies and monopolies, and in favour of civil liberties. It was oriented particularly towards the fishing industry and campaigns for the coastal electorate. It advocated the redistribution of fishing rights, as few big fishing companies had bought up around 70% of all quotas. While Reykjavík-based large-scale fisheries became rich, some coastal villages that were dependent on draught became impoverished. The party decided in March 2012 to merge with the newly formed Dawn.

==History==
The Liberal Party was founded by Sverrir Hermannsson, a former MP of the Independence Party and CEO of Landsbanki, in November 1998. Sverrir had been a member of Independence-led governments from 1983 to 1988 before he went into the private sector. He turned his back to the Independence Party in disappointment over their turn to neoliberal policies.

In 2006/2007, the minor New Force party merged into the Liberal Party, which caused the prominent Liberal Party member Margrét Sverrisdóttir to leave the party and join the Icelandic Movement - Living Land, threatening to split the Liberal Party.

The party had, before the 2007 parliament elections, moved from being primarily focused on issues of fishing quotas and small fishing communities toward immigration. It was the only political party in Iceland that supports strict restrictions on immigration, and consequently the party was accused of xenophobia. The party conducted a members&#x27; poll in January 2009 in order to determine its EU stance. The outcome was against EU-accession of Iceland. The party supports strict neutrality.

In February 2009, two of the Liberal Party&#x27;s parliamentarians left the party; Jón Magnússon joined the Independence Party and Kristinn H. Gunnarsson joined the Progressive Party.

==Ideology==

===Fishing quotas===
The party was founded in opposition of the fishing quotas system which the Independence Party and Progressive Party passed in 1983. The party sought to represent those coastal villages that felt left out as the ownership of the quotas was consolidated in a few Reykjavík-based fisheries.

===Privatisation===
The party was not as positive towards privatisations as the Independence Party. It opposed the privatisation on the energy company Hitaveita Suðurnesja.

===Immigration===
The party had a conservative attitude towards immigration and wished to implement further restrictions.

===Foreign policy===

The part was against the idea of Iceland joining the European Union. The party&#x27;s stance was decided in a party members&#x27; poll which was conducted in December 2008. The question was: &quot;Should Iceland seek EU-membership?&quot;. The results were published in January 2009 with 51.6% being against EU-accession, 34.8% in favour and 9.5% undecided.

The party supported Iceland&#x27;s membership of NATO, but was firmly opposed to the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq.

<text>There are many and diverse political parties in the Philippines. Most party membership consists primarily of political figures and leaders, with little or no grassroots membership.

The Philippines operates under a multi-party system, characterized by numerous political parties. Due to the absence of sustaining memberships and the necessity for coalition governments, parties often experience a rise-and-fall dynamic.
There are three types of parties in the Philippines. These are: (a) major parties, which typically correspond to traditional political parties; (b) minor parties or party-list organizations, which rely on the party-list system to win Congressional seats; and (c) regional or provincial parties, which correspond to region-wide or province-wide organizations, respectively.
==National parties in office==

=== Major parties ===

<text>This article lists political parties in Saint Kitts and Nevis.
Saint Kitts and Nevis has a modified two-party system, which means that there are two dominant political coalitions, with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party.

Before the 2015 election the conservative People&#x27;s Action Movement, the Nevis-based Concerned Citizens Movement and the 2013 formed People&#x27;s Labour Party founded the Team Unity alliance. After that the social democratic Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party and the Nevis Reformation Party formed an accommodation to contest the polls.

<text>In Islam, Barakah or Baraka ( &quot;blessing&quot;) is a blessing power, a kind of continuity of spiritual presence and revelation that begins with God and flows through that and those closest to God.

The Quran is said to be charged with &quot;barakah&quot;, and God can bestow prophets and saints with &quot;barakah&quot;. Especially Muhammad and his descendants are said to be especially endowed with it. These special people can transfer their &quot;barakah&quot; to ordinary people, both while being dead or alive.

Sacred places are said to contain &quot;barakah&quot; and ward off evil spiritual forces, thus monasteries and Sufi temples are often visited for protection against demonic beings.

As a blessing force, barakah is also a force of creation and fertility, causing cereals to miraculously multiply.

<text>This article lists political parties in Samoa.
, Samoa has six officially recognized political parties, the ruling Fa&#x27;atuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (FAST) party, the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP), the Tautua Samoa Party, the Samoa First Party, and the Samoa National Democratic Party. In May 2020 a fifth party, the &quot;Tumua ma Puleono&quot;, registered for the elections, and in July 2020, the Fa&#x27;atuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi did as well to challenge the longstanding HRPP, which had been in power since 1982.

Despite political parties being present in the country, ideologies and manifestos remain relatively fluid, with local connections and matai holding great/more influence in convincing voters to support a particular candidate over party affiliation in many circumstances.

<text>Rotten Apples (The Smashing Pumpkins – Greatest Hits as titled on the album&#x27;s cover) is a greatest hits compilation album by alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins. In the US, it was released on November 20, 2001, along with a bonus disc titled &quot;Judas O&quot;. The album&#x27;s concluding track, &quot;Untitled&quot;, was the Pumpkins&#x27; final recording before their breakup. Completed in the days leading up to the band&#x27;s farewell concert at the Metro in Chicago, it was also released as a single. Another notable track is &quot;Real Love&quot;; while previously released on &quot;Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music&quot;, this was taken from the factory master tapes and, as a result, lacks the pops and clicks inherent in all copies of &quot;Machina II&quot; (which is vinyl sourced).

The title of the album is the namesake of a B-side that was released on the &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; single. Peaking at number 31 in the US, the album sold 77,000 units in its first week of being released.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Rotten Apples&quot; was released on November 20, 2001. According to Dan Tallis, writing for BBC, this album was &quot;[a] rare pleasure these days, a collection of tracks that span a band&#x27;s career that can actually justify the Greatest Hits title.&quot; Regarding the Judas O disc, Tallis wrote, &quot;[t]he Judas O B-sides and rarities collection will satisfy Pumpkin obsessives with its outtakes from the Adore and Machina sessions, but it simply cannot compete with its sister CD. &#x27;Here&#x27;s to the Atom Bomb&#x27;, &#x27;Waiting&#x27; and &#x27;Rock On&#x27;, (yes, a cover of the David Essex classic - which also features lyrics from Van Halen songs) stand out from the others, which at worst slip into incoherent rock ramblings.&quot;

==Track listing==
There exists two versions of &quot;Rotten Apples&quot;; one is exclusive to North America and includes the song &quot;Landslide&quot;, which is replaced by &quot;Try, Try, Try&quot; in the international version.
 &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; is misprinted as &quot;Rhinocerous&quot; on the back cover and the disc. Also, the version on the compilation is the version off the &quot;Lull EP&quot; where the last 30 seconds of the original recording (some guitar noise) is cut off.
The last half of &quot;Drown&quot; is also cut, getting rid of the extended guitar solo.

<text>The BK 27 (also BK27 or BK-27) (German abbreviation for &quot;Bordkanone&quot;, &quot;on-board cannon&quot;) is a caliber revolver cannon manufactured by Mauser (now part of Rheinmetall) of Germany. It was developed in the late 1960s for the MRCA (Multi Role Combat Aircraft) program that ultimately became the Panavia Tornado.

The BK 27 is a gas-operated cannon firing a series of 27×145 mm cartridges with a typical projectile weight of 260 g (9.2 oz), and a total weight for the complete round of 516 g (1.14 lb). Most models use a linked feed system for the ammunition; however, the Eurofighter Typhoon makes use of a specially developed variant of the BK 27 that uses a linkless feed system instead, which is intended to improve reliability.

==Design==
The Mauser BK 27 is used in the Panavia Tornado, the Alpha Jet, the JAS 39 Gripen, and the Eurofighter Typhoon. At one time Lockheed Martin was considering a licensed-built version for the F-35 Lightning II.

Rheinmetall has also developed remote-controlled naval versions, the MN 27 GS and the MLG 27 fully automatic naval guns, which are installed on many ships of the German Navy. Ninety-nine MLG 27s have been ordered by the German Navy so far. The cannon is a single-barrel, high-performance, breech-cylinder gun operated by a fully automatic, electrically fired, gas-operated system at a selective rate of 1000 or 1700 rounds per minute(+/− 100 rpm). The Mauser BK 27 utilizes pyrotechnic cocking charges to cycle the action.

The gun mainly fires mine shells as these have the best effect against aircraft, there are also several types of armor piercing shells like the frangible armour piercing shell named Fap 27 mm x 145 mm ammunition/peb327 (DM103).

===Operational history===

In his book Typhoon, former RAF pilot Mike Sutton reported his 27 mm cannon jamming during a strafing run in Syria, against ISIS targets, while supporting Allied ground units. According to his book, the Typhoon was to be built, originally, without an internal gun, like the F-4 Phantom and the Harrier. However, while a decision was made to install an internal gun, this led to &quot;manufacturing issues&quot;. Sutton claimed that during his strafing run the gun jammed after &quot;twenty-six rounds&quot;, the HUD showing &quot;GUN FAIL&quot;. During the debrief this problem was well known to both the pilots and ground crews. One pilot told Sutton: &quot;They said that issue had been fixed&quot;, to which Sutton replied &quot;Exactly. We&#x27;ve been here before.&quot;

== A–C ==

=== Alignment ===
Alignment can mean:
* the directions the feet face in relationship to the room. See Direction of movement.
* the positioning of the body&#x27;s &quot;building blocks&quot; (head, shoulders, abdomen, hips) in top of each other.

=== Amalgamation ===
A combination of two or more figures; more generally: a sequence of figures that a couple wants to dance.

=== American Rhythm === 
A category of dances in American Style ballroom competitions. It includes cha-cha-cha, rumba, East Coast swing, bolero, and mambo. Sometimes it may include samba and West Coast swing.

This category loosely corresponds to the Latin category of International Style ballroom.

=== American Smooth ===

A category of dances in American Style ballroom competitions. It includes waltz, tango, foxtrot, and Viennese waltz. Previously Peabody was also included.

This category loosely corresponds to the Standard category of International Style ballroom. However, Smooth differs from Standard in its inclusion of open and separated figures, whereas Standard makes exclusive use of closed positions.

=== American Style ===
The term describes a particular style of ballroom dances developed in the United States that contrasts with the International Style. In a narrower sense, it denotes the group of dances danced in American Style ballroom competitions. The group consists of two categories: American Smooth and American Rhythm.

=== Backleading ===
In social dancing strongly relying on leading and following, this term means that the follower executes steps without waiting for or contrary to the lead of the leader. This is also called &quot;anticipation&quot; and usually considered bad dancing habit. An exception would be to avoid a collision with another couple the leader hasn&#x27;t seen (but this is usually just to stop the leader performing specific steps rather than the follower actively executing steps).

Sometimes this term is used in the meaning of hijacking, which is not exactly the same.

=== Ballroom ===
=== Body contact ===
Body contact is a style of closed position in partner dancing (&quot;closed position with body contact&quot;); it is also a type of physical connection, mainly of the right-hand sides of the partners&#x27; costal arches.

=== Body flight ===
Body flight is a property of many movements in dances such as the waltz and foxtrot. It refers to steps taken with momentum in excess of that necessary to arrive at a point of static balance over the new position, which suggests a carry through to another step in the same direction. Steps in these dances naturally flow one into another, in contrast to the tango and to the Latin and rhythm dances where many steps arrive to a point of static balance.

=== Body support ===
Support of the partner&#x27;s body is largely avoided in ballroom dancing. The exception would be &quot;lifts&quot; – often featured in some forms of swing dancing, and ballroom showdance presentations, but banned in ordinary ballroom competition and rarely seen in social dancing.

=== Call ===
A call in square dancing is a command by a caller to execute a particular dance figure. In round dancing, calls are called &quot;cues&quot;. See &quot;Caller&quot; for the explanation of the difference. Voice calls may be complemented by hand signs. See also Voice cue.

=== Caller ===
A caller or a cuer is a person that calls/cues dance figures to be executed in square dances and round dances.

=== Center ===
When indicating a direction of movement during a dance, the term &quot;center&quot; means the direction perpendicular to the line of dance (LOD) pointing towards the center of the room. If one stands facing the LOD, then the center direction is to their left.

The term &quot;center&quot; may also be used as shorthand for the center point of balance.

=== Center point of balance ===
Together with the center of gravity (COG), the center point of balance (CPB) helps the dancer to better understand and control their movements. CPB differs from the two other centers in two respects. The exact location of the COG is always well-defined, however it significantly depends on the shape the body assumes. In contrast, the CPB during normal dancing (head up, feet down on the floor) is always at the same place of the dancer&#x27;s body, although defined in a loose way.

It is said that the CPB is in the general area of the solar plexus for the gentlemen, and navel for the women.

=== Chassé ===
A chassé is a figure of three steps in which the feet are closed on the second step.

=== Check ===
A pronounced discontinuation of movement through the feet. This is created by locking the back of one knee into the front of the other knee. A check position is created in Latin Ballroom dances such as rumba and cha-cha-cha, as well as in International Standard Ballroom dances such as quickstep locks.

=== Closed dance figure ===
The term has at least two meanings: regarding dance position and regarding footwork.
*A figure performed in closed position.
*A figure in which at the last step the moving foot closes to rest at the support foot. Examples are box step in American Style waltz or natural turn in International Style waltz.

=== Closed position ===

The ordinary position of ballroom dancing in which the partners face each other with their bodies approximately parallel. In Standard and Smooth the bodies are also offset about a half body width such that each person has their partner on their right side, with their left side somewhat unobstructed; in tango, the offset is somewhat larger. Contrast promenade position and open position.

=== Compression ===
The term has several meanings.

*Compression is a type of physical connection, opposite to leverage, in which the dance partners lean together while being connected. In other words, a stress exists at the point(s) of contact directed towards the contact point(s) of the dance partner. The term is frequently used, e.g., in the swing dance community.
* Compression is lowering the body by bending the knees in a preparation for a step. The term is mostly used in describing the rises and falls technique of ballroom dances of Standard (International style) and Smooth (American style) categories: waltzes, tangos, foxtrots.
* Compression is a hip action in Latin dances. 
* An action to achieve a graceful sway.

=== Connection ===

A means of communication between dancers in the couple. Physical and visual types of connection are distinguished. Physical connection, sometimes referred to as resistance or tone, involves slightly tensing the upper-body muscles, often in the context of a frame, thus enabling leader to communicate intentions to follower. See compression and tension, two basic associated actions/reactions.

=== Contra body movement ===

Refers to the action of the body in turning figures; turning the opposite hip and shoulder towards the direction of the moving foot.

=== Contra body movement position ===

Contra body movement position occurs when the moving foot is brought across (behind or in front) the standing foot the body turning. Applies to every step taken outside partner; occurs frequently in tango and in promenade figures.

=== Counter promenade position ===
In ballroom dances, the dance couple moves (or intends to move) sidewise to the leader&#x27;s right while the bodies form a V-shape, with leader&#x27;s left and follower&#x27;s right sides are closer than the leader&#x27;s right and follower&#x27;s left. In other dances, there are other definitions.

=== Cuban hip motion ===

=== Cue ===
A signal to execute a dance figure. See Call and Voice cue.

== D–J ==

=== Dance formation ===

=== Dance move ===
=== Dance pattern ===
=== Dancesport ===
&quot;Dancesport&quot; is an official term to denote dance as competitive, sport activity.

=== Dance step ===
For one meaning, see Dance move, for another one, see Step. See also Glossary of dance steps.

=== Direction of movement ===
=== Direction of step ===
=== Direction of turn ===
=== Fallaway ===
Both dance partners take (at least) a step backwards into promenade position.

=== Figure ===
A completed set of steps. More explicitly: a small sequence of steps comprising a meaningful , and given a name, for example &quot;whisk&quot; or &quot;spin turn&quot;.

=== Follower ===
=== Footwork ===
In a wider sense, the term footwork describes dance technique aspects related to feet: &quot;foot position&quot; and &quot;foot action&quot;.

In a narrow sense, e.g., in descriptions of ballroom dance figures, the term refers to the behavior of the foot when it is in contact with the floor. In particular, it describes which part of the foot is in contact with the floor: ball, heel, flat, toe, high toe, inside/outside edge, etc. In the Smooth and Standard dances, it is common for the body weight to progress through multiple parts of the foot during the course of a step. Customarily, parts of the foot reached only after the other foot has passed to begin a new step are implied but not explicitly mentioned.

=== Formation ===
# A &quot;formation&quot; or &quot;dance formation&quot; is a team of dance couples.
# &quot;Formation&quot; of a dance team is the specification of
#* positions of dancers or dance couples on the floor relative to each other and
#* directions the dancers face or move with respect to others.

=== Formation dance ===
Formation dance is a choreographed dance of a team of couples, e.g., ballroom sequence or ballroom formation dance/team.

=== Full weight ===
&quot;Full weight&quot; or &quot;full-weight transfer&quot; means that at the end of the step the dancer&#x27;s center of gravity is directly over the support foot. A simple test for a full weight transfer is that you can freely lift the second foot off the floor.

=== Frame ===
Dance frames are the positions of the upper bodies of the dancers (hands, arms, shoulders, neck, head, and upper torso). A strong frame is where your arms and upper body are held firmly in place without relying on your partner to maintain your frame nor applying force that would move your partner or your partner&#x27;s frame. In swing and blues dances, the frame is a dancer&#x27;s body shape, which provides connection with the partner and conveys intended movement.

Major types of dance frames are Latin, smooth, and swing.

=== Guapacha ===
Guapacha timing is an alternative rhythm of various basic cha-cha steps that are normally counted &quot;&lt;1&gt;, 2, 3, cha-cha-1&quot; whereas &quot;cha-cha-1&quot; is counted musically &quot;4-&amp;-1&quot;. In Guapacha, the step that normally occurs on count &quot;2&quot; is delayed an extra half-beat, to the &quot;&amp;&quot; of 2, making the new count &quot;&lt;1&gt;, &lt;hold&gt;-&amp;-3, 4-&amp;-1&quot;.

=== Handhold ===
Handhold is an element of dance connection: it is a way the partners hold each other by hands.

=== Heel lead ===
Landing on the heel of the foot in motion during a step before putting weight on the remainder of the foot. As in normal walking, much of the swing of the foot is accomplished with its midpart closest to the floor, emphasis shifting to the heel only as the final placement is neared.

=== Heel turn ===
A heel turn is an action danced by the partner on the inside of turn in certain figures in Standard or Smooth. During the course of rotation, the dancer&#x27;s weight moves from toe to heel of one foot while the other foot swings to close to it, then forward from heel towards the toe of the just closed foot. Follower&#x27;s heel turns feature body rise coincident with the first step, which leads her foot to close next to the standing one rather than swing past. In contrast, when the leader is dancing a heel turn the rise is delayed until the conclusion of the turn, as he can better lead the amount of turn from a more grounded position. The heel turn is distinguished from other members of the family of heel pull actions which do not require complete closure of the feet. Follower&#x27;s heel turns are commonly found in the double reverse spin and the open or closed telemark, and the natural and reverse turns of international style foxtrot, while leader&#x27;s heel turns form the basis of the open or closed impetus.

=== Hijacking ===
In social dancing strongly reliant on leading and following, hijacking means temporary assuming the leading role by the follower. Also known as &quot;stealing the lead&quot;. Contrast backleading.

=== International Latin ===
International Latin is category of dances in International Style ballroom competitions. It includes samba, cha-cha-cha, rumba, pasodoble, and jive.

=== International Standard ===
A category of dances in International Style ballroom competitions. Sometimes in the context of competitions it is called &quot;Ballroom&quot; or &quot;International Ballroom&quot;, confusing as it might be. (In England, the term &quot;Modern&quot; is often used, which should not be confused with modern dance that derives from ballet technique) It includes waltz (formerly called &quot;slow waltz&quot;), tango, foxtrot, quickstep, and Viennese waltz. This category loosely corresponds to the Smooth category of American Style ballroom.

=== International Style ===
The term describes a particular style of ballroom dances that contrasts with American Style. In a narrower sense, it denotes the group of dances danced in International Style ballroom competitions. The group consists of two categories: Standard and Latin.

===Jack and Jill===
Jack and Jill (J&amp;J) is a format of competition in partner dancing, where the competing couples are the result of random matching of leaders and followers. Rules of matching vary. The name comes from the popular English nursery rhyme, &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;. In venues with same-gender dance partners, the ambiguous names &quot;Pat and Chris&quot; have been used, or event could be called &quot;Mix and Match&quot;.

In dance competitions J&amp;J is included as a separate division (or divisions, with additional gradations).
J&amp;J is popular at swing conventions, as well as at ballroom dance competitions in the United States.

== L–R ==

=== Latin ===
As applied to dances, Latin dance is any type of social dance of Latin American origin.

=== Latin hip motion ===
A characteristic type of hip motion found in the technique of performing a step in Latin and Rhythm dances. Although most visible in the hips, much of the effect is created through the action of the feet and knees. Sometimes it is also called Cuban hip motion, although because of the divergence in dance technique between American Rhythm and International Latin some prefer to distinguish the two, with the term &quot;Latin motion&quot; reserved for International Style, while the &quot;Cuban motion&quot; reserved for American Style and Club Latin dances. The most notable distinction (in a simplified description) is that in the International Style &quot;Latin motion&quot; the straightening of the knee happens before the full weight transfer, while in the &quot;Cuban motion&quot; the straightening of the knee happens after the full weight transfer. As a result, the Cuban hip motion results in a more fluid leg movement, whereas the Latin hip motion results in a more staccato leg movement.

=== Leader ===
=== Leading and following ===
=== Lead stealing ===
=== Leverage ===
The term describes type of physical connection, opposite to compression, in which the dance partners lean away from each other while being connected. In other words, a stress exists at the point(s) of contact directed away from the contact point(s) of the dance partner. Predominantly used in the swing dance community. See also tension.

=== Line of dance ===
Line of dance (LOD or LoD) is conceptually a path along and generally parallel to the edge of the dance floor in the counterclockwise direction. To help avoid collisions, it is agreed that in travelling dances dancers should proceed along the line of dance.

Line of dance is a useful line of reference when describing the directions of steps taken, e.g., &quot;facing LOD&quot;, &quot;backing [or reverse] LOD&quot;. See also center, wall. Reference to the direction of movement is based on the direction faced by the leader rather than the follower.

=== Line of foot ===
An imaginary straight line passing through the foot in the heel-toe direction.

=== Measures per minute ===
Measures per minute, or MPM, refers to the tempo of the music according to the number of measures or bars occurring in one minute of music. This can vary from as low as 25–27 MPM for international style rumba to as fast as 58–60 MPM for international style Viennese waltz.

=== Moving foot ===
The foot that is in action (tap, ronde, etc.) while most or all of the body&#x27;s weight is being supported by the standing foot. Compare Supporting foot.

=== Musicality ===
=== New Vogue ===
=== No foot rise ===

In descriptions of the footwork of step patterns the abbreviation NFR stands for &quot;no foot rise&quot; (or &quot;no foot-rise&quot;) and means that the heel of the support foot remains in contact with the floor until the weight is transferred onto the other foot. The rise is felt in body (i.e. the torso) and legs only, not in the feet.

=== Open dance figure ===
The term has at least two meanings: regarding dance position and regarding footwork.
*A figure performed in open position.
*A figure in which during the last step the moving foot passes the support foot. Examples are the feather step in foxtrot or the open reverse turn, e.g. in tango.

=== Open position ===
Open position is any dance position in couple dances, in which the partners stand apart in contrast to closed position. They may face inwards or outwards, and hold one or both hands or stand independently.

=== Outside partner position ===
A step into outside partner position occurs when the moving foot of the forward travelling partner moves on a track outside of their partner&#x27;s standing foot when it would ordinarily move on a track aimed between their partner&#x27;s feet. Due to the offset of the hold, this generally applies to a step with the right foot. (The term &quot;left side outside&quot; is often used for the rare occurrences when the left foot crosses to pass outside, as in the Hover cross). Steps into outside partner position are also required to be in contra body movement position, and are often preceded by a step with a strong side lead. The term &quot;inline&quot; is occasionally used when it is necessary to clarify that an outside partner position is not involved.

=== Pat and Chris ===

=== Physical connection, physical lead ===
A dance connection by means of physical contact. Types of physical connection are body contact, compression, leverage.

=== Pinched shoulder ===
Pinched shoulder is the position seen when promenade position is incorrectly danced with an outward rotation of the upper bodies, rather than a rotational stretch in each body. It is characterized by one or both partners having their trailing elbow behind the line of their shoulders, with a resulting break in the arm line at the trailing shoulder.

=== Progressive dance ===

=== Promenade position ===
The promenade position is described differently in various dance categories. 

In ballroom dances their common trait is that the dance couple moves (or intends to move) essentially sidewise to the leader&#x27;s left while partners nearly face each other, with the leader&#x27;s right side of the body and the follower&#x27;s left side of the body are closer than the respective opposite sides (forming a V-shape when looking from above). Steps of both partners are basically sidewise or diagonally forward with respect to their bodies. Normally the dancers look in the direction of the intended movement.

In square dances it is a close side-by-side position in various handholds with the general intention to move together forward, &quot;in promenade&quot;.

In American tango, the partners shift their shoulders, hips and heads to a variable degree less and up to 90 to that of their original position, while their feet: man&#x27;s left; lady&#x27;s right are rotated respectively leftward and rightward to make a &quot;V&quot; (to the left/right). This exact position is also called semi-open in some dance books, by some authors and teachers, especially in American Smooth Ballroom dance.
The shift in Argentine/salon style tango is less pronounced and more individualized: the hold similarly variable but usually very close especially in the upper body, less in the hips.
In some swing dances (East Coast, triple-count, country, or single-count), the feet are more opened/rotated in their respective directions to lie parallel to each other and exactly perpendicular to their original Closed position placement.
The intention, is for the position to anticipate a change in direction of movement, to direct each partner of the couple/partnership, and to lead the follower to step in the direction of the rotation between their bodies; similarly for the counter promenade position.

=== Replace ===
In brief descriptions of dance figures, &quot;replace&quot; means replacing the weight to the previous support foot while keeping it in place. For example, a &quot;rock back&quot; figure may be described as &quot;step back, replace&quot;. Notice that it doesn&#x27;t require to &quot;replace&quot; the moving foot to the place from where it come in the previous step.

=== Rhythm ===
*See American Rhythm.
*See Rhythm.

=== Rise and fall ===
Rises and falls refer to the body ascending and descending by use of feet, ankles, and legs, to create dynamic movement.

== S–Z ==

=== Shadow position ===
Both partners face the same general direction, one of them (the man) behind and slightly shifted leftwards (&quot;in the shadow&quot;). Handholds vary. Variants: sweetheart position, cuddle position.

=== Side lead ===
A body position or action during a step, sometimes also called &quot;same side lead&quot;. &quot;Side-leading&quot; refers to a movement during which the side of the body corresponding to the moving foot is consistently in advance as a result of a previous contra body movement or &quot;body turns less&quot; action. A step with side lead will often precede or follow a step of the opposite foot taken into contra body movement position (in which the leading side is that opposite the moving foot) without requiring intervening rotation of the body.

Due to the offset position of the partners in the hold, a left side lead may be quite pronounced whereas a right side lead will be more subtle if taken in closed position.

=== Slot ===
In slotted dances, the &quot;dance slot&quot; is an imaginary narrow rectangle along which the follower moves back and forth with respect to the leader, who is more or less stationary. As a rule, the leader mostly stays in the slot as well, leaving it only to give way for the follower to pass him.
Some slots are fixed, some can rotate, some are only from close hold to open hold with one arm, or double from one side of the man to his full reach on the other (as in hustle), depending on the dance floor space available and the specific dance. The leader in social and performance/exhibition dancing is more free to step out from the slot, more in some dances, and dance styles (such as hustle and salsa), than in others.

=== Slotted dance ===
A dance style in which the couple&#x27;s movements are generally confined to a slot. The most typical slotted dance is west coast swing. Some other dances, e.g., hustle and salsa, may be danced in slotted style. Compare spot dance, travelling dance.

=== Smooth ===

=== Spot dance ===
A dance that is generally danced in a restricted area of the dance floor. Examples are rumba, salsa, east coast swing. Compare travelling dance, slotted dance.

=== Spotting ===
A technique used during turns. The dancer chooses a reference point (such as their partner or a distant point along the line of travel) and focuses on it as long as possible. When during the turn it is no longer possible to see it, the head flips as fast as possible to &quot;spot&quot; the reference point again. This technique guides the body during the turn, makes it easier to determine when to stop turning, and helps prevent dizziness.
It must be done by rotating the head as close to perfectly in the horizontal plane as possible so as not to defeat the purpose of minimizing dizziness in those so predisposed. The most common spotting is 180° to and away from one&#x27;s partner, or the line of dance (LOD) and a full 360° from the original spot, be it LOD, outside line of dance (OLOD), or toward or away from one&#x27;s partner, a wall for example. It can be done in apart/free position or less frequently in closed position.

=== Standard ===

===Stationary dance===

=== Stealing the lead ===
In social dancing strongly reliant on leading and following, stealing the lead means temporary assuming the leading role by the follower. Also known as &quot;hijacking&quot;. Contrast backleading.

=== Step ===
*In a strict sense, a &quot;step&quot;, or a &quot;footstep&quot;, is a single move of one foot, usually involving full or partial weight transfer to the moving foot. However foot actions, such as &quot;tap&quot;, &quot;kick&quot;, etc., are also sometimes called &quot;steps&quot;. For example, in a description: &quot;step forward, replace, together&quot; all three actions are steps.

: Sometimes it is important to define the exact limits of one (foot)step, i.e., exactly when it begins and ends. In describing the detailed technique in Standard and Smooth dances (waltz, tango...) it is agreed that in figures where the moving foot doesn&#x27;t stop at the support foot a step begins (and the previous step ends) at the moment when the moving foot passes the support foot. Notice that according to this agreement such steps begin and end precisely at the &quot;counts&quot; 1, 2, etc. which normally match musical beats.

*In a broader sense, &quot;step&quot; means &quot;dance step&quot;, i.e., a &quot;dance figure&quot;, for example: basic step, triple step.

=== Standing foot ===
Same as Supporting foot.

=== Supporting foot ===
It is also called &quot;support foot&quot; or &quot;standing foot&quot;, a foot which bears the full or nearly full weight while the other foot does some action (step, tap, ronde, etc.). Compare moving foot.

=== Sway ===

The term &quot;sway&quot; has a specific meaning in the technique of ballroom dancing. Basically, it describes a body position in which its upper part gracefully deflects from the vertical. The direction of sway is usually away from the standing foot and the direction of movement.

=== Syncopation ===
In dancing, the term &quot;syncopation&quot; has two meanings. The first one is similar to the musical terminology: stepping on an unstressed musical beat. The second one is making more (and/or different) steps than required by the standard description of a figure, to address more rhythmical nuances of the music. The latter usage is considered incorrect by many dance instructors, but it is still in circulation, a better term lacking.

=== Tension ===
Describes a physical connection, opposite to compression, in which a stress exists at the point(s) of contact directed away from the contact point(s) between partners. People frequently resort to describing the actions as &quot;push&quot; (compression, towards partner) and &quot;pull&quot; (tension, away from partner) to get the idea across. See also leverage.

=== Three &quot;T&quot;s ===
&quot;Technique, timing, and teamwork&quot;. The criteria for evaluation of dance mastery in the swing dancing community.

=== Timing ===
The relation of the elements of a dance step or dance figure with respect to musical timing: bars and beats. Also the synchronizing of movements between the dance partners, or between the parts of a dancer&#x27;s body.

=== Toe lead ===
Landing on the toe of the foot in motion during a step before putting weight on the remainder of the foot.

=== Top line ===
The top line is the way dancers hold their head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, and upper back.

=== Tracking, track of foot ===
The trajectory of the moving foot visualized as a narrow imaginary track, forward and backward of the foot rather than a line. For the standing foot, its track is determined by its current orientation on the floor which may be noted on the inside of turns where the feet often point in differing directions.

=== Travelling (progressive) dance ===
A dance that significantly travels over the dance floor, generally in the direction of the line of dance. Examples are waltz, foxtrot, polka, samba, Argentine tango. Compare spot dance, slotted dance.

=== Visual connection, visual lead ===
A dance connection by means of visual awareness of partners in a couple.
Visual connection by no means should replace the physical connection, and some consider it to be an inferior form of connection. However it does have its proper usages. Most important are the coordination of styles (arms, etc.) and when dancing without physical contact. An important example of the latter is spotting the partner during turns, especially free spins.

This type of connection is essential for &quot;shine position patterns&quot;, commonly found in Latin dances like the cha-cha-cha, mambo, and salsa as well as &quot;side by side position patterns&quot;.

=== Voice cue ===
Voice cues help match rhythmic patterns of steps (or other moves) with the music. There are different types of voice cues. 
*The most common example is the usage of &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; words: &quot;quick-quick-slow&quot; (pronounced as &quot;quick quick slo-o-o-ow&quot;) immediately tells you that the third step takes twice the time of the first one (and of the second one).
*Some East Coast Swing instructors cue the basic step as &quot;shuf-fle-STEP, shuf-fle-STEP, rock BACK&quot;, to indicate both the rhythmic pattern of the figure (1&amp;2, 3&amp;4, 5, 6) and the syncopated character of swing music: every second syllable is stressed.
*Still another example: the box step of American-style rumba may be cued as &quot;forward-...-side-together, back-...-side-together&quot;, to indicate the directions of (leader&#x27;s) steps and their timing.
*Finally, for more advanced dancers voice cues are actually names of dance figures and standard variations:
**&quot;Two walks, link, closed promenade&quot; (tango).
**&quot;Open Telemark, natural fallaway, whisk, quick wing&quot; (waltz).
**&quot; (Spanish, used in )
Cues are an important element of round dances. In square dances they are called &quot;calls&quot; and called by a caller.

=== Wall ===
When indicating a direction of movement during a dance, the term &quot;wall&quot; means the direction perpendicular to the line of dance (LOD) pointing towards the wall of the room (possibly imaginary). If one stands facing the LOD, then the wall direction is to their right.

<text>Boaz Yakin (, born June 20, 1965) is an Israeli-American screenwriter, film director, and producer based in New York City. He has written screenplays to films like &quot;The Rookie&quot;, &quot;Fresh&quot;, &quot;A Price Above Rubies&quot;, &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;, and &quot;Now You See Me&quot;, and has directed the 2000 sports drama &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; and the 2012 Jason Statham action film &quot;Safe&quot;. As a producer he has collaborated frequently with filmmaker Eli Roth and served as executive producer for the first two entries in the &quot;Hostel&quot; franchise.

==Early life==
Yakin was born in New York City. Both his parents are Israeli-born, and met in Paris while studying miming with Marcel Marceau. His father&#x27;s family are of Syrian Jewish and Egyptian Jewish descent, and his mother&#x27;s family is of Ashkenazi Polish Jewish descent.

He attended the Bronx High School of Science, where he was classmates in 1983 with actor Jon Cryer. He studied filmmaking at City College of New York then at New York University and made his first deal for a screenplay at age 19.

==Career==
After finishing school, Yakin worked in the film industry, developing projects for several companies, and saw his first screenplay reach the screen in 1989, when &quot;The Punisher&quot;, a vehicle for Dolph Lundgren, was released. Yakin&#x27;s next screenplay was &quot;The Rookie&quot;, starring Clint Eastwood and Charlie Sheen. Wanting to take on more personal material, Yakin drew from his experiences growing up in New York&#x27;s inner city for his next screenplay, &quot;Fresh&quot;. Yakin opted to direct his screenplay for &quot;Fresh&quot; himself. The film won critical acclaim, earning the Filmmaker&#x27;s Trophy at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival.

Yakin went back to his youth for inspiration on his next project. His experience with the Chassidic community informed his screenplay for &quot;A Price Above Rubies&quot;. Yakin rebounded with his next assignment, which was his first film that he directed but did not write; &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; was a major box office success, and moved him to the upper tier of bankable Hollywood talents.

His Holocaust drama &quot;Death in Love&quot; debuted in January 2008. Yakin describes it as a movie about the failure of the family and inability to change your past.

He was a member of the US Dramatic Jury at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.

In 2010, it was announced that Yakin would direct &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, with Samuel L. Jackson and Josh Duhamel in the cast. The project was still in development as of 2014.

Yakin&#x27;s family film &quot;Max&quot; was released by Warner Bros. and MGM on June 26, 2015.

His 2020 film, &quot;Aviva,&quot; was set to premiere at the SXSW Film Festival, but was released publicly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Personal life==
Yakin was married to Israeli music video director Alma Har&#x27;el. The couple divorced in 2012.

<doc id="409451" wikidata="Q320296" url="?curid=409451" title="Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington">
<text>Lieutenant-General Arthur Richard Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington, (3 February 1807 – 13 August 1884), styled Lord Douro between 1812 and 1814 and Marquess of Douro between 1814 and 1852, was a British soldier and politician. The eldest son of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, victor of Waterloo and Prime Minister, he succeeded his father in the dukedom in 1852 and held minor political office as Master of the Horse from 1853 to 1858. In 1858, he was made a Knight of the Garter.

==Background and education==
Wellesley was born at Harley Street, Marylebone, London, the eldest son of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, and the Honourable Catherine Sarah Dorothea &quot;Kitty&quot; Pakenham, daughter of Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford. Lord Charles Wellesley was his younger brother and Lord Wellesley, Lord Mornington and Lord Cowley his uncles. He was educated at Temple Grove School, Eton College, Christ Church, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He became known by the courtesy title Lord Douro when his father was created Earl of Wellington in 1812 and as Marquess of Douro in 1814 after his father was elevated to a dukedom.

==Military career==
Lord Douro became an ensign in the 81st Regiment of Foot in 1823 and in the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot in 1825, a cornet in the Royal Horse Guards in 1825, a lieutenant in the Royal Horse Guards in 1827, a captain in the Royal Horse Guards in 1828 and in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps the same year, a major in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps in 1830 and in the Rifle Brigade in 1831, a lieutenant-colonel on the unattached list in 1834, a brevet colonel in 1846, a lieutenant-colonel in the Victoria (Middlesex) Rifle Volunteer Corps in 1853 and a major-general in 1854.

Wellesley was known as one of the foremost advocates of the Volunteer movement, and served as lieutenant-colonel of one of the earliest of the volunteer rifle corps, the Victoria Rifles (Middlesex).

==Political career==
Lord Douro was elected to Parliament for the rotten borough of Aldeburgh in 1829, a seat he held until its abolition by the Reform Act 1832. He was out of Parliament until 1837, when he was returned for Norwich. In 1852 he succeeded his father in the dukedom and entered the House of Lords. In early 1853 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Master of the Horse in Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s coalition government, a post he retained when Lord Palmerston became prime minister in 1855. He resigned along with the rest of the Palmerston government in 1858. The latter year he was made a Knight of the Garter.

In 1863, Wellington inherited the earldom of Mornington on the death of his cousin William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley, 5th Earl of Mornington. From 1868 to 1884 he was Lord-Lieutenant of Middlesex.

==Family and personal legacy==

Wellington married Lady Elizabeth Hay, daughter of Field Marshal George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale, in 1839. They had no children. The marriage was not a happy one although Lady Elizabeth was a great favourite with her father-in-law. On succeeding his illustrious father he was said to have remarked: &quot;Imagine what it will be when the Duke of Wellington is announced, and only I walk in the room.&quot; The relationship between father and son is often described as the classic case of the son of a famous father who cannot match such fame. Wellington died at Brighton railway station, Brighton, Sussex, in August 1884, aged 77, and was buried at the family seat Stratfield Saye House, Hampshire. His probate was resworn six years later at . He was succeeded by his nephew, Henry. The Duchess died at Bearhill (Burhill) Park (House), Hersham, Surrey, in August 1904, aged 83, and was buried at Stratfield Saye. Her probate left assets of £13,997.

He owned 19,000 acres of these 15,000 acres in Hampshire.

==In literature==
The Brontë family portrayed the first Duke of Wellington and his two sons in their imaginary games about the colonisation of Africa. They wrote many stories about Arthur, with Charlotte assuming the character of Charles as the &quot;author&quot; of these stories. As Charlotte and Branwell moved into their teenage years and used Lord Byron&#x27;s writings as inspiration, they focused on Arthur as a romantic, heroic figure. He was known to them as the Duke of Zamorna, and later as Emperor Adrian of Angria. Elements of his character formed the basis for Edward Rochester in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

Thomas Raikes (&quot;the Younger&quot;), a British merchant banker, dandy and diarist, was a close childhood friend, travelling and gambling companion of Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington. His journals &quot;Two volumes of Private Correspondence with the 2nd Duke of Wellington and other Distinguished Contemporaries&quot; were published in 1861.

<text>Karaoke is a 1996 British television drama written by Dennis Potter with the knowledge that he was dying from pancreatic cancer.

It forms the first half of a pair with the serial &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot;. The two plays were filmed as a single production by the same team; both were directed by Renny Rye. The series was said to be inspired by Potter&#x27;s working relationship with Louise Germaine.

The plays were a co-production between the BBC and rival broadcaster Channel 4, a unique arrangement Potter had expressly requested before his death. The show was first aired on BBC1 on Sunday evenings, with a repeat on Channel 4 the following day.

The series stars Albert Finney, Richard E. Grant, Hywel Bennett, Roy Hudd and Julie Christie and features Saffron Burrows and Keeley Hawes in two early screen appearances.

The principal character of &quot;Karaoke&quot; is Daniel Feeld, an English playwright in late middle-age who is working on the television production of his latest play, itself entitled &quot;Karaoke&quot;. The play concerns the relationship between a young woman, Sandra Sollars, her boyfriend Peter Beasley and Arthur &#x27;Pig&#x27; Mailion, the owner of the sleazy karaoke/hostess bar where Sandra works.

One evening, while sitting in a restaurant, Feeld becomes convinced that a couple at a nearby table who resemble the fictional Sandra and Peter are repeating lines of dialogue from the play. Daniel later encounters the young woman and discovers that her name is indeed Sandra, and that she works in a club owned by one Arthur Mailion. He relates the coincidence to a frightened Sandra, who runs away, leaving behind her handbag. Daniel subsequently relates the story to his agent Ben Baglin and producer Anna Griffiths, who assume that Daniel&#x27;s apparent paranoia is due to his worsening health through heavy drinking and smoking.

Daniel discovers a small pistol and a credit card in Sandra&#x27;s handbag. After using the card to determine her address, he visits her home in order to return the bag, but first removes the pistol. He discovers that Sandra was carrying the pistol because of her intention to avenge a savage attack on her mother carried out by Mailion years earlier. Disturbed by the possibility that the death of the fictional Sandra in his play may come true in real life, Daniel decides to change his play. Meanwhile, having also discovered the existence of the real Mailion, Anna discusses with the play&#x27;s director, Nick Balmer the possibility of changing Mailion&#x27;s name in order to avoid litigation.

Nick has been conducting an affair with Linda Langer, the actress who plays Sandra in the film version of &quot;Karaoke&quot;, but is also the intended victim of a blackmail plot hatched by Linda and Mailion. He dismisses the attempt, is beaten up by Mailion&#x27;s thugs, and confesses all to his wife, Lady Balmer, with whom he is reconciled.

Daniel is admitted to hospital and told he has only weeks to live. He changes his will, leaving his body to an experimental cryogenics laboratory, and offering a generous portion of his estate to Sandra and her mother, on the condition that Sandra ceases working at the club and renounces her intention to kill Mailion. Sandra agrees, but Daniel remains uneasy about her intentions.

One night, he leaves the hospital, taking the pistol with him, and visits Mailion&#x27;s club, where he performs a striking version of &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; before shooting Mailion dead in his office and arranging an alibi with the unsuspecting Baglin to cover up the murder.

<text> is a Latin aphorism, usually translated &quot;seize the day&quot;, taken from book 1 of the Roman poet Horace&#x27;s work &quot;Odes&quot; (23 BC).

==Translation==
 is the second-person singular present active imperative of &quot;&quot; &quot;pick or pluck&quot; used by Horace to mean &quot;enjoy, seize, use, make use of&quot;. &quot;Diem&quot; is the accusative of &quot;&quot; &quot;day&quot;. A more literal translation of would thus be &quot;pluck the day [as it is ripe]&quot;—that is, enjoy the moment. It has been argued by various authors that this interpretation is closer to Horace&#x27;s original meaning. Latin scholar and Saint Joseph&#x27;s University professor, Maria S. Marsilio points out, &quot;carpe diem&quot; is a horticultural metaphor that, particularly seen in the context of the poem, is more accurately translated as &quot;plucking the day&quot;, evoking the plucking and gathering of ripening fruits or flowers, enjoying a moment that is rooted in the sensory experience of nature.

==History==
===Sources===
Text from &quot;Odes&quot; :
===In ancient literature===
Perhaps the first written expression of the concept is the advice given by Siduri to Gilgamesh in Mesopotamian mythology, telling him to forgo his mourning and embrace life, although some scholars see it as simply urging Gilgamesh to abandon his mourning, &quot;reversing the liminal rituals of mourning and returning to the normal and normative behaviors of Mesopotamian society.&quot;

==Meaning==
In Horace, the phrase is part of the longer , which is often translated as &quot;Seize the day, put very little trust in tomorrow (the future)&quot;. The ode says that the future is unforeseen and that one should not leave to chance future happenings, but rather one should do all one can today to make one&#x27;s own future better. This phrase is usually understood against Horace&#x27;s Epicurean background.

===Related expressions===

 (&quot;gather, girl, the roses&quot;) appears at the end of the poem &quot; (&quot;Of growing roses&quot;, also called &quot;Idyllium de rosis&quot;) attributed to Ausonius or Virgil. It encourages youth to enjoy life before it is too late; compare &quot;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may&quot; from Robert Herrick&#x27;s 1648 poem &quot;To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time&quot;.

&quot;&quot; (&quot;On the Shortness of Life&quot;), often referred to as &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot;, (Let us rejoice) is a popular academic commercium song, on taking joy in student life, with the knowledge that one will someday die. It is medieval Latin, dating to 1287.

Related but distinct is the expression &quot;memento mori&quot; (remember that you are mortal) which carries some of the same connotation as . For Horace, mindfulness of our own mortality is key in making us realize the importance of the moment. &quot;Remember that you are mortal, so seize the day.&quot; Over time the phrase also came to be associated with penitence, as suggested in many paintings. Today many listeners will take the two phrases as representing almost opposite approaches, with urging us to savour life and urging us to resist its allure. This is not the original sense of the phrase as used by Horace.

==Contemporary mentions==
In modern English, the expression &quot;YOLO&quot;, meaning &quot;you only live once&quot;, expresses a similar sentiment.

In the 1989 American film &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, the English teacher John Keating, played by Robin Williams, famously says: &quot;Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.&quot; Later, this line was voted as the 95th greatest movie quote by the American Film Institute.

In the Animal Crossing series, messages referencing this phrase can be seen when catching fish. In Animal Crossing and Animal Crossing: Wild World, catching a Crucian carp will result in the message &quot;I caught a crucian carp! Carpe diem!&quot; In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, catching a Carp will result in the message &quot;I caught a carp! I really seized the diem!&quot;

The Terry Pratchett comic fantasy novel &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot; parodies the phrase in its title--instead of seize the day, it translates to &quot;seize the throat&quot;. 

In 2011 the Phineas and Ferb episode &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, the musical ended with a song titled &quot;Carpe diem&quot; in which Before Phineas tells Isabella what &quot;Carpe Diem means&quot;.

In the 2017 Korean drama series &quot;Chicago Typewriter&quot;, the club &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; is owned by Shin Yool and is the scene of revolutionary activities of the Joseon Youth Liberation Alliance spearheaded by Seo Hwi-young.

Social philosopher Roman Krznaric suggested in his book &quot;Carpe Diem Regained&quot; (2017) that &quot;carpe diem&quot; is the answer to consumer cultures schedules, timed work days, consumer culture and planning out our actions over the course of weeks and the weekends, instead of &quot;just do it&quot;, with thought experiments for seizing the day rather than placing into calendars.

The song &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; by Joker Out was used to represent Slovenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023.

The acronym DiEM, used by the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, alludes to the Latin aphorism.

In the song the Whole Being Dead Thing from Beetlejuice the musical, Beetlejuice sings &quot;We should have carpe’d way more diems / Now we’re never gonna see ‘em!&quot;.

<text>Henry Wellesley, 3rd Duke of Wellington (5 April 1846 – 8 June 1900) was a British peer and Conservative Party politician.

==Early life==
He was a son of Lord Charles Wellesley and grandson of the 1st Duke of Wellington. He was born with no title but inherited the dukedom when in 1884 his uncle died childless.

Between 1859 and 1865 he attended Eton.

==Career==

He joined the 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards as an ensign on 16 May 1865, was promoted to major on 1 July 1881, and retired from the service on 28 June 1882. He unsuccessfully contested the Parliamentary constituency of Andover in 1868. He won the seat in 1874 and held it until the next election, 1880.

He succeeded his uncle as Duke of Wellington on 13 August 1884. Subsequently, his sisters Victoria and Mary were granted the rank of daughters of a Duke. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Hampshire Militia Artillery on 22 November 1884, and the 6th West York Militia on 10 April 1886. He held both honours until his death. He was special ambassador to Spain for the funeral of Alfonso XII in 1885, and chairman of the Society for the Suppression of Mendicity.

==Personal life==

On 7 March 1882, Wellesley married Evelyn Katrine Gwenfra Williams (1855–1939), a daughter of Thomas Peers Williams, MP for Great Harlow, and sister of Owen Williams, MP, Hwfa Williams, and Edith Peers-William (wife of the 7th Earl of Aylesford) among others.

Wellington died at the family home of Strathfield Saye in 1900 and was buried there. As Evelyn and Henry had no issue, he was succeeded by his brother, Arthur Charles. His widow, who remarried to a Wellesley cousin Hon. Frederick Arthur Wellesley (son of Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley), died on 11 March 1939.

===In popular culture===
In her memoirs, Lady Angela Forbes comments that &quot;The Duke was the fattest man I have ever seen, and went by the nickname of &quot;Spurgeon&quot;.

<text>The Kingdom of God Is Within You (pre-reform Russian: ; post-reform ) is a non-fiction book written by Leo Tolstoy. A Christian anarchist philosophical treatise, the book was first published in Germany in 1894 after being banned in his home country of Russia. It is the culmination of 30 years of Tolstoy&#x27;s thinking and lays out a new organization for society based on an interpretation of Christianity focusing on universal love.

&quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot; is a key text for Tolstoyan proponents of nonviolence, of nonviolent resistance, and of the Christian anarchist movement.

==Background==

The title of the book originates from Luke 17:21. In the book, Tolstoy speaks of the principle of nonviolent resistance when confronted by violence, as taught by Jesus Christ. When Christ says to turn the other cheek, Tolstoy asserts that Christ means to abolish violence, even the defensive kind, and to give up revenge. Tolstoy rejects the interpretation of Roman and medieval scholars who attempted to limit its scope.

Tolstoy was largely inspired by the writings of American Christian anarchists Adin Ballou and William Lloyd Garrison, who also shared his viewpoint that all governments who waged war were an affront to the New Testament and Christian ethics. Tolstoy discusses Ballou and Garrison&#x27;s texts and biographies at length in the book, including a whole excerpt of Ballou&#x27;s &quot;Non-Resistance Catechism&quot; (originally published in 1844). As the Russian Orthodox Church was at the time an organization merged with the Russian state which was completely subservient to the state&#x27;s policies, Tolstoy sought to separate its teachings from what he believed to be the true gospel of Christ, specifically the Sermon on the Mount.

Tolstoy advocated nonviolence as a solution to nationalist woes and as a means for seeing the hypocrisy of the church. In reading Jesus&#x27; words in the Gospels, Tolstoy notes that the modern church is a heretical creation:

Tolstoy presented excerpts from magazines and newspapers relating various personal experiences, and gave keen insight into the history of non-resistance from the very foundation of Christianity, as being professed by a minority of believers. In particular, he confronts those who seek to maintain &quot;status quo&quot;:

In 1894, Constance Garnett, who translated the work into English, wrote the following in her translator&#x27;s preface:

One cannot of course anticipate that English people, slow as they are to be influenced by ideas, and instinctively distrustful of all that is logical, will take a leap in the dark and attempt to put Tolstoy&#x27;s theory of life into practice. But one may at least be sure that his destructive criticism of the present social and political regime will become a powerful force in the work of disintegration and social reconstruction which is going on around us.

==Reception==

===Tolstoy&#x27;s relationship with Mohandas Gandhi===

Mohandas Gandhi wrote in his autobiography &quot;The Story of My Experiments with Truth&quot; () that Tolstoy&#x27;s book &quot;overwhelmed&quot; him, and &quot;left an abiding impression&quot;. Gandhi listed Tolstoy&#x27;s book, as well as John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Unto This Last&quot; and the poet Shrimad Rajchandra (Raychandbhai), as the three most important modern influences in his life. Reading this book opened up the mind of the world-famous Tolstoy to Gandhi, who was still a young protester living in South Africa at the time.

In 1908, Tolstoy wrote &quot;A Letter to a Hindu&quot;, which Gandhi would read, and which outlined the notion that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the native Indian people overthrow the colonial British Empire. This idea ultimately came to fruition through Gandhi&#x27;s organization of nationwide nonviolent strikes and protests during the years 1918–1947. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish &quot;A Letter to a Hindu&quot; in his native language, Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy&#x27;s death a year later in 1910. The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence, as well as Gandhi&#x27;s wishes for Tolstoy&#x27;s health. Tolstoy&#x27;s last letter to Gandhi &quot;was one of the last, if not the last, writings from his pen.&quot;

===With other nonviolent activists===

In 1894, &quot;The Kingdom of God is Within You&quot; inspired the soldier Arthur St. John to become a pacifist. It also had a great effect upon James Bevel, a major 1960s strategist of the civil rights movement. After reading the book while serving in the U.S. Navy, Bevel came to the conclusion that he would be unable to kill another person. He thereafter sought and was granted an honorable discharge, and entered a seminary for religious training.

==== Importance of Jesus&#x27; words ====
&quot;The Kingdom of God is Within You&quot; is the key phrase in Luke 17:21 which furthers the idea of nonviolence. Jesus said, &quot;for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you&quot; in response to the Pharisees asking when the Kingdom of God will come. The saying has numerous explanations including that enlightenment is within you, in your heart, and your spark of God has always been there. Therefore only a nonviolent, peaceful nature will result in nonviolent, peaceful, Kingdom of God outcomes.

<text>Barbara Taylor Bradford (10 May 1933 – 24 November 2024) was a British-American best-selling novelist. Her debut novel, &quot;A Woman of Substance&quot;, was published in 1979 and sold over 30 million copies worldwide. She wrote 40 novels, often about young women of humble beginnings who rise through their hard work in business. Her books were translated into 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies; ten of her books were also adapted as television miniseries and television movies. Her commercial success amassed a large fortune and she was awarded several honorary degrees and made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her literary contributions.

==Early life==
Barbara Taylor was born on 10 May 1933 in Armley, Leeds, to Freda and Winston Taylor. Her father was an engineer who had lost a leg while serving in the First World War. She attended Christ Church Upper Armley CofE Primary School in the Leeds suburb of Upper Armley alongside the writer Alan Bennett. As a child during the Second World War, she held a jumble sale at her school and donated the £2 proceeds to the &quot;Aid to Russia&quot; fund. She later received a handwritten thank-you letter from Clementine Churchill, the wife of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Taylor left school aged 16.

Her older brother Vivian died of meningitis before she was born. She later described her mother as having &quot;put all her frustrated love into me&quot;. Her parents&#x27; marriage is fictionalised in her 1986 novel &quot;An Act of Will&quot;.

In her youth, Barbara Taylor read Charles Dickens, the Brontë sisters, Thomas Hardy, and Colette. At the age of ten she decided to be a writer after sending a story to a magazine. She was paid 7s 6d for the story, with which she bought handkerchiefs and a green vase for her parents.

Her biographer, Piers Dudgeon, later uncovered evidence that her mother Freda Walker was the illegitimate daughter of Oliver Robinson, 2nd Marquess of Ripon, a local Yorkshire landowner who employed the author&#x27;s grandmother, Edith Walker, as a servant. Dudgeon informed Taylor Bradford that her grandmother and Ripon had had three children together. After some hesitation, Taylor Bradford allowed Dudgeon to publish this information in his biography. Although initially angry at Dudgeon&#x27;s discovery, she later said that &quot;I came round. There&#x27;s no stigma now.&quot; Her grandmother later spent time in workhouses, which Taylor Bradford explored in the ITV television series &quot;Secrets of the Workhouse&quot; (2013).

==Career==
After working briefly in the newspaper&#x27;s typing pool, Taylor became a reporter for the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;. While there, she worked alongside Keith Waterhouse. At the age of 20, Taylor moved to London, where she later became the fashion editor of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Own&quot; magazine and a columnist for the &quot;London Evening News&quot;. She went on to write an interior decoration column syndicated to 183 newspapers. 

Her first fiction writing efforts were four suspense novels, a genre she later abandoned. Bradford would subsequently describe &quot;interviewing herself&quot;, saying that &quot;I was in my late thirties. I thought: what if I get to 55, and I&#x27;ve never written a novel? I&#x27;m going to hate myself. I&#x27;m going to be one of those bitter, unfulfilled writers.&quot; Her debut novel, &quot;A Woman of Substance&quot; (1979), became an enduring best-seller and, according to Reuters, ranks as one of the top-ten best-selling novels of all time. Bradford considered Irish historian and author Cornelius Ryan her literary mentor. Ryan encouraged her writing and was the first person (other than her mother) to whom she had confided her literary ambitions. Her favourite contemporary authors were P. D. James, Bernard Cornwell, and Ruth Rendell. 

Bradford wrote 40 novels; the last one, &quot;The Wonder of It All&quot;, was published in 2023. Her books were translated into 40 different languages and sold more than 90 million copies. In a 1979 interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Bradford reflected on her career and anticipated legacy: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to go down in history as a great literary figure. I&#x27;m a commercial writer—a storyteller. I suppose I will always write about strong women. I don&#x27;t mean hard women, though. I mean women of substance.&quot; A common pattern in her novels was a young woman of humble background rising in business through years of hard work, often involving enormous self-sacrifice. She was quoted as saying: &quot;I write about mostly ordinary women who go on to achieve the extraordinary.&quot;

===Film adaptations===
Ten of Bradford&#x27;s books were made into television mini-series and television movies, produced by her husband Robert E. Bradford. These include:

* &quot;A Woman of Substance&quot;
* &quot;Hold the Dream&quot;
* &quot;To Be the Best&quot;
* &quot;Act of Will&quot;
* &quot;Voice of the Heart&quot;

==Recognition==
Bradford received honorary degrees from the University of Leeds, the University of Bradford, Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College, Sienna College, and Post University. She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II as part of the 2007 Birthday Honours for her contributions to literature. Her original manuscripts are archived at the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds beside those of the Brontë sisters. In 1990 she was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; where she was surprised by Michael Aspel at Heathrow Airport. In 2017, Taylor Bradford was recognised as one of ninety &quot;Great Britons&quot; to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s 90th birthday.

==Personal life==
Taylor met her husband, American film producer Robert E. Bradford, on a blind date in 1961 after being introduced by the English screenwriter Jack Davies. They married in 1963 and moved permanently to the United States. 

Bradford&#x27;s wealth was estimated at between £60–166 million. There were rumours that she owned 2,000 pairs of shoes and that her former Connecticut home&#x27;s lake was heated for the benefit of her swans. She addressed the rumours in a 2011 interview, tracing the shoes rumour to a joke and the heated lake to the previous owners of the house who had installed it on part of the lake to provide an ice-free area for a pair of swans in winter.

Robert Bradford died in 2019. Barbara Taylor Bradford lived in Manhattan, New York City, and became an American citizen in 1992. On 24 November 2024, she died at home from cancer at the age of 91.

<text>Ernest Ralph Tidyman (January 1, 1928 – July 14, 1984) was an American author and screenwriter, best known for his novels featuring the African-American detective John Shaft. His screenplay for &quot;The French Connection&quot; garnered him an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as a Golden Globe Award, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award. In 1971, he also co-wrote the screenplay for the film version of &quot;Shaft&quot; with John D. F. Black.

==Early life==
Tidyman was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Kathryn (Kascsak) and Benjamin Ralph Tidyman, a crime reporter for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;. He was of Hungarian and British descent. He began his career as a copyboy in Cleveland when he was 14, having dropped out of school in grade seven.

Tidyman enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1946 serving in public relations. He worked as a journalist and crime reporter for the next two decades in a number of cities, including a stint as editor of Diners Club magazine, and writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; (1960–66), &quot;New York Post&quot; (1957–60), male magazines and black newspapers. In 1968 he wrote his first novel, &quot;Flower Power&quot; about hippies. He then decided to write about a black detective, &quot;Shaft&quot;.

== Career ==

===&quot;Shaft&quot; and &quot;French Connection&quot;===
He later said about writing &quot;Shaft&quot;, &quot;Reading black fiction, you see that the central figure is either super hero or super victim, as in [William] Styron&#x27;s book. The blacks I knew were smart and sophisticated, and I thought, what about a black hero who thinks of himself as a human being, but who uses his black rage as one of his resources, along with intelligence and courage.&quot;

His novel &quot;Shaft&quot; was read by Philip d&#x27;Antoni, who hired him to write &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

&quot;We think he has the potential to be a better than average thriller writer&quot;, said director William Friedkin. &quot;He writes people so that an audience can define characters quickly, but then complications begin to set in.&quot; Friedkin said he rewrote much of the script &quot;But Tidyman&#x27;s name will be first&quot; on the credits.

Friedkin&#x27;s rewriting and credit grab annoyed Tidyman, who downplayed the director&#x27;s contribution.

The dual success of &quot;Shaft&quot; and &quot;French Connection&quot; made Tidyman one of the top screenwriters in the business. &quot;Tidyman from a standing start suddenly looks like a one man resuscitator for the movie as public entertainment&quot;, wrote &quot;The&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Tidyman was one of the few filmmakers to speak up for the much-maligned James T. Aubrey, president of MGM, who financed &quot;Shaft&quot;. &quot;Nobody ever lied to me at MGM or told me they were going to do something they didn&#x27;t do&quot;, he said.

===Producer===
However, he was not happy with the final films, particularly &quot;Shaft&quot;, and decided to move into producing as well, establishing Ernest Tidyman Productions in 1971. Ernest Tidyman Productions was changed to Ernest Tidyman International, Ltd., in 1971 and back to Ernest Tidyman Productions in 1979. Tidyman also established Shaft Productions in 1972 to handle &quot;Shaft&quot;&#x27;s sequels, Pilgrim Productions to handle &quot;Big Bucks&quot;, and Family Trouble Productions to produce an unmade film &quot;Family Trouble&quot;.

&quot;You have to hyphenate&quot;, he said. &quot;If you&#x27;ve got an idea, you&#x27;d better write it, and then you&#x27;d better produce it, so you can control it. This town depends more on the men who write, on the storytellers, than on anybody else, and it doesn&#x27;t begin [...] to know how to deal with them rightly.&quot;

He wrote the screenplay for the 1973 film &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot;, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. Tidyman also wrote the sequel to &quot;Shaft&quot;, &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score&quot;, which appeared in theaters in 1972.

In 1974, he published &quot;Dummy&quot;, a non-fiction account of the story of Donald Lang, an accused deaf-mute murderer. It was nominated for an Edgar in the Fact Crime category. He adapted the book into a 1979 TV movie starring LeVar Burton.

===Later career===
He co-wrote &quot;A Force of One&quot; in 1979, one of Chuck Norris&#x27;s earlier films.

In 1980, he wrote the teleplay for the TV movie &quot;Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones&quot;, which he also had a hand in producing, which got him an Emmy nomination. For creating the &quot;Shaft&quot; books, he became one of the few white individuals to win an NAACP Image Award.

&quot;I write for money&quot;, Tidyman said in a 1980 interview. He got up at six am and wrote for 12 hours a day.

Tidyman summed up the three main elements of his craft as:
&quot;Drama, usually in the event itself, clarity of the telling, and most importantly, energy: the energy that I am able to infuse into the same words that are available to anybody who knows the language and its structure. If I can tell a story in a way that contains energy – a force – I think it&#x27;s fairly certain it will be told in an interesting way.&quot;
==Personal life==

Tidyman married five times. He had two sons, Ben (adopted) and Nathaniel, with his third wife Ruth Rayle Tidyman. With his fourth wife, Susan Gould, he fathered two children – Adam and Nicholas.

In 1982, he married former Motown soul singer Chris Clark, who had co-written the screenplay for &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; (1972).

Tidyman died in 1984 in Westminster Hospital in London, England, due to a perforated ulcer and other complications.

He participated in the Mexican–American War, in the 1851 revolution against Antonio López de Santa Anna, in the Reform War (against the conservatives), and (on the nationalist side) against the usurper Maximilian of Mexico. He died as a result of battle injuries sustained in 1863 in the aftermath of the Siege of Puebla.

==Honors==
There is a municipality of Ignacio de la Llave in the state of Veracruz, named after him. In 1932, it was renamed from San Cristóbal de la Llave.

Also, the state of Veracruz was known as Veracruz-Llave from 1863 to 2004, and since 2004, it has been officially known as Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave.

<text>The Chicontepec Basin (Chicontepec Formation) is a petroleum system in Mexico north-east of Mexico City, covering an area of around in the states of Veracruz, Puebla and Hidalgo. Several oil fields have been discovered in that area since 1926. A major field was discovered in 1973 but contains extra heavy crude, which due to special refining needs is considered unviable at this time. Since that time, tiny amounts of oil have been produced. While the reserves are overwhelmingly extra heavy crude, pockets of lighter tight oil, as well as natural gas, are also found in the basin.

== Attempts at increasing output ==

In March 2006, Mexican President Vicente Fox announced that Pemex would invest US$37.5 billion over the next 20 years on the oil fields of Chicontepec. It was hoped that this will boost output to . Pemex&#x27;s chief executive estimates that 20,000 wells are to be drilled in order to exploit this field.

Intensive drilling has taken place in Chicontepec in recent years, starting with a contract for 500 new wells offered in December 2008. However, results in terms of output have been disappointing, with the field still yielding a modest in May 2012.

<text>In traditional Japanese folklore a —also known as , , with a boss called or —is a reptiloid with similarities to . can become harmful when not respected as gods. Accounts typically depict them as green, human-like beings with webbed hands and feet and turtle-like carapaces on their backs. A depression on the head, called a &quot;dish&quot; (), retains water, and if this is damaged or its liquid is lost (either through spilling or drying up), a becomes severely weakened.

The favor cucumbers and love to engage in sumo-wrestling. They are often accused of assaulting humans in water and removing a mythical organ called the from their victim&#x27;s anus.

==Terminology==

The name &quot;kappa&quot; is a contraction of the words &quot;kawa&quot; (river) and &quot;wappa&quot;, a variant form of 童 &quot;warawa&quot; (also &quot;warabe&quot;) &quot;child&quot;. Another translation of kappa is &quot;water-sprite&quot;. The &quot;kappa&quot; are also known regionally by at least eighty other names such as &quot;kawappa&quot;, &quot;kawako&quot;, &quot;kawatarō&quot;, &quot;gawappa&quot;, &quot;kōgo&quot;, &quot;suitengu&quot;.

It is also called &quot;kawauso&quot; &#x27;otter&#x27;, &quot;dangame&quot; &#x27;soft-shelled turtle&#x27;, and &quot;enkō&quot; &#x27;monkey&#x27;, suggesting it outwardly resembles these animals. The name &quot;komahiki&quot; or &quot;steed-puller&quot; alludes to its reputed penchant to drag away horses.

The kappa has been known as &quot;kawako&quot; in Izumo (Shimane Prefecture) where Lafcadio Hearn was based, and &quot;gatarō&quot; was the familiar name of it to folklorist Kunio Yanagita from Hyōgo Prefecture.

==Appearance==
&quot;Kappa&quot; are said to be roughly humanoid in form and about the size of a child, inhabiting the ponds and rivers of Japan. Clumsy on land, they are at home in the water, and thrive during the warm months. They are typically greenish in color (or yellow-blue), and either scaly or slimy skinned, with webbed hands and feet, and a turtle-like carapace on their back. Inhuman traits include three anuses that allow them to pass three times as much gas as humans. Despite their small stature, they are physically stronger than a grown man.

The &quot;kappa&quot; are sometimes said to smell like fish, and they can swim like them. While potentially dangerous and mischievous, they are said to be very honourable, always keeping promises and being highly intelligent.

According to some accounts, a &quot;kappa&#x27;s&quot; arms are connected to each other through the torso and can slide from one side to the other. While they are primarily water creatures, they do on occasion venture onto land. They have a dish in their head which must be filled with water at all times. When they venture on land, the &quot;dish&quot; on their head can be covered with a metal cap for protection. If the water spills, the Kappa can be easily overcome.

A hairy &quot;kappa&quot; is called a &quot;hyōsube&quot;.
==Behavior ==

&quot;Kappa&quot; are usually seen as kami of the water. Their actions range from comparatively minor misdemeanors, such as looking up women&#x27;s kimono if they venture too near to water, to outright malevolence, such as drowning people and animals, kidnapping children, raping women and at times eating human flesh. Though sometimes menacing, they may also behave amicably towards humans. While younger kappa are frequently found in family groups, adult kappa live solitary lives. However, it is common for kappa to befriend other yōkai and sometimes even people.

===Cucumber===
Folk beliefs claim the cucumber as their traditional favorite meal. At festivals, offerings of cucumber are frequently made to the kappa. Sometimes the kappa is said to have other favorite foods, such as the Japanese eggplant, &quot;soba&quot; (buckwheat noodles), &quot;nattō&quot; (fermented soybeans), or &quot;kabocha&quot; (Japanese pumpkin).

In Edo (old Tokyo), there used to be a tradition where people would write the names of their family members on cucumbers and send them afloat into the streams to mollify the &quot;kappa&quot; and prevent the family from coming to harm in the streams. In some regions, it was customary to eat cucumbers before swimming as protection, but in others it was believed that this act would guarantee an attack.

A cucumber-filled sushi roll is known as a &quot;kappamaki&quot;.

===As a menace===
As water monsters, &quot;kappa&quot; have been blamed for drownings, and are often said to try to lure people into water and pull them in with their great skill at wrestling. They are sometimes said to take their victims for the purpose of drinking their blood, eating their livers, or gaining power by taking their , a mythical ball said to contain the soul, which is located inside the anus.

&quot;Kappa&quot; have been used to warn children of the dangers lurking in rivers and lakes, as &quot;kappa&quot; have been often said to try to lure people to water and pull them in. Even today, signs warning about &quot;kappa&quot; appear by bodies of water in some Japanese towns and villages.
&quot;Kappa&quot; are also said to victimize animals, especially horses and cows. The motif of the &quot;kappa&quot; trying to drown a horse is found all over Japan.

Lafcadio Hearn wrote of a story in Kawachimura near Matsue where a horse-stealing kappa was captured and made to write a sworn statement vowing never to harm people again.

In many versions the &quot;kappa&quot; is dragged by the horse to the stable where it is most vulnerable, and it is there it is forced to submit a writ of promise not to misbehave.

===Defeating the kappa===
It was believed that there were a few means of escape if one was confronted with a &quot;kappa&quot;. &quot;Kappa&quot; are obsessed with politeness, so if a person makes a deep bow, it will return the gesture. This results in the kappa spilling the water held in the &quot;dish&quot; (&quot;sara&quot;) on its head, rendering it unable to leave the bowing position until the plate is refilled with water from the river in which it lives. If a person refills it, the &quot;kappa&quot; will serve that person for all eternity. A similar weakness of the &quot;kappa&quot; involves its arms, which can easily be pulled from its body. If an arm is detached, the &quot;kappa&quot; will perform favors or share knowledge in exchange for its return.

Another method of defeat involves &quot;shogi&quot; or &quot;sumo&quot; wrestling: a &quot;kappa&quot; sometimes challenges a human being to wrestle or engage in other tests of skill. This tendency is easily used to encourage the &quot;kappa&quot; to spill the water from its &quot;sara&quot;. One notable example of this method is the folktale of a farmer who promises his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage to a &quot;kappa&quot; in return for the creature irrigating his land. The farmer&#x27;s daughter challenges the &quot;kappa&quot; to submerge several gourds in water. When the &quot;kappa&quot; fails in its task, it retreats, saving the farmer&#x27;s daughter from the marriage. &quot;Kappa&quot; have also been driven away by their aversion to iron, sesame, or ginger.

===Good deeds===
&quot;Kappa&quot; are not entirely antagonistic to human beings. They can be befriended through gifts of favoured foods, or playful wrestling matches, and they like to befriend lonely children. Since the dish of water on their head is a Kappa&#x27;s greatest weakness, should it spill, a human who refills it will also earn lifelong friendship.

Once befriended, &quot;kappa&quot; may perform any number of tasks for human beings, such as helping farmers irrigate their land. Sometimes, they bring fresh fish, which is regarded as a mark of good fortune for the family receiving it. They are also highly knowledgeable about medicine, and legend states that they taught the art of bone-setting to human beings. There are also legends that Kappa will save human friends from drowning.

== Regional variations ==
Along with the &quot;oni&quot; and the &quot;tengu&quot;, the &quot;kappa&quot; is among the best-known &quot;yōkai&quot; in Japan.

The kappa is known by various names of the creature vary by region and local folklore. In Shintō, they are often considered to be an avatar (&quot;keshin&quot;) of the Water Deity or &quot;suijin&quot;.

Shrines are dedicated to the worship of &quot;kappa&quot; as water deity in such places as Aomori Prefecture or Miyagi Prefecture. There were also festivals meant to placate the &quot;kappa&quot; in order to obtain a good harvest, some of which still take place today. These festivals generally took place during the two equinoxes of the year, when the &quot;kappa&quot; are said to travel from the rivers to the mountains and vice versa.

The best known place where it has been claimed Kappa reside is in the waters of &quot;Tōno &quot; in the Iwate Prefecture. The nearby In Tōno, there is a Buddhist temple that has komainu dog statues with depressions on their heads reminiscent of the water-retaining dish on the kappa&#x27;s heads, said to be dedicated to the &quot;kappa&quot; which according to legend helped extinguish a fire at the temple. The Kappa is also venerated at the &quot;Sogenji&quot; Buddhist temple in the Asakusa district of Tokyo where according to tradition, a mummified arm of a Kappa is enshrined within the chapel hall since 1818.

In his &quot;Tōno Monogatari&quot;, Kunio Yanagita records a number of beliefs from the Tōno area about women being accosted and even impregnated by &quot;kappa&quot;. Their offspring were said to be repulsive to behold, and were generally buried.

==Cross culture lore==
Similar folklore can be found in Asia and Europe. Like the Japanese description of the beast, in Chinese and in Scandinavian lore this beast is infamous for kidnapping and drowning people as well as horses.

The &quot;siyokoy&quot; of the Philippine islands is also known for kidnapping children by the water&#x27;s edge.

A frog-face &quot;vodyanoy&quot; is known in Slavic mythology. A green human-like being named a &quot;vodník&quot; is widely known in western Slavic folklore and tales, especially in the Czech Republic or Slovakia.

In German mythology, a similar creature is known as &quot;Wassermann&quot;, &quot;Nix&quot;, or &quot;Nickel&quot;. They have been mentioned in connection with the larger rivers Elbe and Saale in the eastern part of Germany, but they are most widely connected to Lusatia in South-East Germany. This is not entirely surprising, as the area is not only close to Poland and Czech Republic, but also home to the Slavic minority of the Sorbs.

==In popular culture==

The &quot;kappa&quot; is a popular creature of the Japanese folk imagination; its manifestations cut across genre lines, appearing in folk religion, beliefs, legends, folktales and folk metaphors.

In Japan, the character Sagojō (Sha Wujing) is conventionally depicted as a &quot;kappa&quot;: he being a comrade of the magic monkey Sun Wukong in the Chinese story &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

Ryūnosuke Akutagawa&#x27;s 1927 novella &quot;Kappa&quot; centers on a man who got lost and ended up in the land of the &quot;kappa&quot; near Mount Hotakadake. The story heavily focuses on the subject of suicide and Akutagawa killed himself the year the work was published. Kappas are a recurring image in David Peace&#x27;s novel &quot;Patient X&quot;, itself about the life and work of Akutagawa.

* In the anime show &quot;Inuyasha&quot;, a kappa, Sha Gojyo&#x27;s descendant said to be a descendant of the legendary character from &quot;Journey of the West&quot; and together with Son Goku&#x27;s descendant, the servant of Chokyūkai to find a bride. Later, since Hakudoshi collecting the heads of other yōkai, they tracked down Hakudoshi and Kagura, that he didn&#x27;t they&#x27;re Naraku&#x27;s incarnations, and watching as Hakudoshi to peer into the yōkai heads to catch a glimpse of the Border of the Afterlife.
* Kagome&#x27;s grandfather gave her an alleged mummified foot of a kappa for her early 15th birthday, but she does not accept and gives to Buyo.
* In episode 4 of &quot;&quot;, Grandpa Higurashi gifted to his great-granddaughter, Moroha, a mummified kappa&#x27;s foot as a gift, which she accepts and keeps.

&quot;Kappa&quot;, and creatures based on them, are recurring characters in Japanese &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films and television shows. Examples include the kappas in the Daiei/Kadokawa series &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot;, the 2010 &quot;kaiju&quot; film &quot;Death Kappa&quot;, and &quot;King Kappa&quot;, a &quot;kaiju&quot; from the 1972 Tsuburaya Productions series &quot;Ultraman Ace&quot;.

These &quot;yōkai-&quot;like &quot;kami&quot; also represent Japan as a nation, featuring in advertisements for a range of products from a major brand of sake to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi&#x27;s DC Card (a credit card). In their explicitly commercial conceptions, &quot;yōkai&quot; are no longer frightening or mysterious—the DC Card Kappa, for example, is not a slimy water creature threatening to kill unsuspecting children but a cute and (almost) cuddly cartoon character.

* &quot;Summer Days with Coo&quot; is a 2007 Japanese animated film about a &quot;kappa&quot; and its impact on an ordinary family, written for the screen and directed by Keiichi Hara based on two novels by Masao Kogure.
* It is said that the company president of Calbee liked &quot;kappa&quot;, so he wanted the name &quot;Kappa&quot; to be included in one of his products. That brought about Kappa Ebisen, a popular shrimp-flavored snack in Japan.
* In &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot;, the titular Turtles accidentally activate the Time Scepter, a mystical artifact, and end up travelling back in time, to Japan of the Edo period (more specifically 1603). As a running gag, some of the villagers who interact with them feel frightened by their appearance and refer to them as the legendary &quot;kappa&quot; throughout the film. Notably, the Turtles quickly befriend children in the village, and Leonardo demonstrates for them the modern medical technique of CPR to save a boy&#x27;s life.

<doc id="409481" wikidata="Q382458" url="?curid=409481" title="Regional Municipality of Halton">
<text>The Regional Municipality of Halton, or Halton Region, is a regional municipality in Ontario, Canada, located in the Golden Horseshoe of Southern Ontario. It comprises the city of Burlington and the towns of Oakville, Milton, and Halton Hills. Policing in the Region is provided by the Halton Regional Police Service. The regional council&#x27;s headquarters are located in Oakville. Burlington, Oakville, and Milton are largely urban and suburban, while Halton Hills is more rural.

Halton is part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), although it is the only regional municipality in the GTA that is not situated directly adjacent to Toronto’s city proper. However, the region is split between the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) of Toronto and Hamilton. Burlington is part of the Hamilton CMA, while the rest of the region is part of the Toronto CMA.

Halton experienced a growth rate of 17.1% between 2001 and 2006, and 14.2% between 2006 and 2011, giving it one of the highest growth rates in the country. Despite the unprecedented growth in residential development, agriculture and protected lands along the Niagara Escarpment are still the predominant land uses in the region. Halton has been ranked by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; national crime ranking report as being the &quot;safest place to live&quot; in the GTA and one of the top five in Canada.

==History==
The Regional Municipality of Halton was established on 1 January 1974 as the successor to the former Halton County by the &quot;Regional Municipality of Halton Act, 1973&quot;. From 1 January 2003, it has been governed by the &quot;Municipal Act&quot;.

Until the 2000 municipal elections, the chairperson of the regional council had been appointed by the Ontario government. From that date, it has been an elective position. Joyce Savoline was the last appointed chairperson, and was elected and reelected until her retirement from the position in 2006. The current regional chairperson is Gary Carr.

==Regional council==

The council consists of the elected chairperson, the mayors of the local municipalities, and regional councillors elected by wards from the local municipalities (who also sit on their respective municipal councils).

The current membership of the council is as follows:

== Regional services ==
Halton Region provides the following services to its communities:
*Economic development
*Emergency planning
*Regional planning and growth management
*Recycling and waste
*Regional roads
*Sewage (wastewater) collection systems and treatment plants
*Water purification plants and distribution systems
*Housing supports and services
*Children and parenting
*Employment and financial assistance
*Ontario Works (social services)
*Services for seniors
*Paramedic services
*Public health
*Immunizations and preventable diseases
*Food safety
*Halton Regional Police Service

In 2018, the Region had 27 emergency vehicles and 254 paramedics; the latter answered 53,094 paramedic calls. The Police service had 721 police officers; its 911 call centre received 121,971 reports of emergency.

==Geography==

While the urban areas of Burlington, Oakville and Milton are experiencing rapid growth, there is still a significant proportion of the Region that is still rural, most of which is protected as part of the provincial Greenbelt or as part of the Niagara Escarpment Plan.

Halton is somewhat unusual, in that it has three distinct climate zones within its relatively small area, which are as follows:

* Zone 5a - Halton Hills lying to the north of the Niagara Escarpment, together with the Town of Milton within the Grand River watershed
* Zone 5b - the remainder of Halton Hills, Milton north of Derry Road, and that part of Burlington lying north of the Niagara Escarpment
* Zone 6a - the southern remainder of the Region

===Climate===




==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Regional Municipality of Halton had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. The unemployment rate was 5.3% during the year. The average household income was very high, at $121,000.


==Economy==

===Labour force===

===Agriculture===

&quot;x = suppressed for reasons of confidentiality&quot;

Halton&#x27;s agricultural sector is supported by regional infrastructure such as the Port of Hamilton which is a growing agri-food hub for the import of agricultural inputs and the export of local crops.

===2018 economic report===
The 2018 budget document contains additional specifics and updates as to the Region&#x27;s finances. In that year, gross revenues were $1.2 billion while operating expenses totaled $821.5 million for a net revenue of $350.2 million, an increase of 1.2% over the previous year. The increase was mostly due to increases in grants and taxes. The Region included over 13,200 companies and employed over 229,000 persons. The credit rating of AAA was confirmed by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Moody&#x27;s Investors Service.

<doc id="409482" wikidata="Q7363003" url="?curid=409482" title="Rome Rule">
<text>&quot;Rome Rule&quot; was a term used by Irish unionists to describe their belief that with the passage of a Home Rule Bill, the Roman Catholic Church would gain political power over their interests in Ireland. The slogan was popularised by the Radical MP and Quaker John Bright during the first Home Rule crisis in the late 19th century and continued to be used in the early 20th century.

==Background==
The term has been documented as used in the House of Commons as early as 12 July 1871. The Local and Personal Act bill had been proposed by Denis Caulfield Heron, MP for Tipperary. The Nationalist MP for Westmeath, Patrick James Smyth, rose to second the Bill and used his speech to advocate repeal of the Union. In reply John Vance, the Unionist MP for Dublin City, stated: &quot;The constituents of the honourable member for Westmeath would not be satisfied with the homoeopathic dose of &#x27;home rule&#x27; embodied in the present bill&quot; and his own opinion was that &quot;home rule&quot; in Ireland would prove to be &quot;Rome rule&quot;.

Anti-Catholicism was prevalent amongst some of the Irish Protestant population: Most Irish Protestants were deeply afraid of a repetition of the events of 1798 and the years just before. They tended to consider Roman Catholicism and possible rebellion as almost identical terms. To keep things as they were in Church and State seemed the guarantee of safety.

Ensuing out of the anti-Catholic landowner slogan &quot;To Hell or Connaught&quot; after the Battle of the Diamond in 1795, the &quot;No Popery&quot; slogan prior to Catholic Emancipation becoming law in 1829 – an event the Protestant Orangemen had long dreaded – their sentiments continued to be aroused by such writings as in the Rev. Thomas Drew&#x27;s pamphlet, reading: I learn by the doctrines, history and practices of the Church of Rome that the lives of Protestants are endangered, the laws of England set at nought, and the crown of England subordinated to the dictates of an Italian bishop. 

==The 1886 Home Rule Bill==
After the collapse of the 1798 United Irish rebellion and the passing of the Act of Union in 1801, the Orange Order was stronger than ever before, but began to decline and fell into disrepute towards the middle of the century. Despite this, Daniel O&#x27;Connell had trouble arranging rallies in Ulster for his Repeal Association, which sought repeal of the Act of Union. Having successfully arranged supportive &quot;monster meetings&quot; in the rest of Ireland, his visit to Belfast in 1841 was marked by stonings, hostile and supportive crowds, and threats of riots. Long before the 1885 Bill it was already clear that a significant number of Irish people wanted to maintain the Union, particularly those resident in Ulster who were not Roman Catholics.

Anglicans of the established Church of Ireland and the other Protestant groups such as Presbyterians had had different legal rights and priorities, and mutual disagreements, until the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the Irish Church Act 1869. While the Act was passed to reflect the small percentage of Church of Ireland members in the Irish population, and to increase the self-esteem of Irish Roman Catholics, the resulting level playing field allowed the different Protestant groups to act as political equals for the first time.

From 1882 Charles Stewart Parnell turned his attention from Irish land reform to pursuing Home Rule. As his National League grew, so did the Irish Protestants&#x27; fear of Home Rule. When Gladstone made known his conversion to Home Rule in 1885 and introduced the First Home Rule Bill, the Orange Order experienced a dramatic revival, became highly respectable, and a very powerful political organisation working for the maintenance of the Union. Ironically some leaders of the Irish Nationalist movement such as Isaac Butt and Charles Stewart Parnell were not Roman Catholics, but the majority of their supporters were.

While southern Ireland was clamouring for repeal of the Union with Britain, Ulster came round to the view that Union with Britain suited her better than any form of self-government for Ireland. For one thing, she saw that the Union was to her economic advantage since she was far more industrialised than the agricultural south, and her future clearly depended on the continuance of friendly trade with Britain. Due to the industrial revolution, Belfast had grown bigger than Dublin. Ulstermen were proud of their achievements and would have seen them as proof of the Weberian theory of the &quot;Protestant work ethic&quot;.

Religious faith combined with business acumen to raise in Ulster a fixed opposition to Home Rule, which was later expressed in the popular slogan, &quot;Home Rule means Rome Rule&quot;. The Ulster unionist subjective sense of separate identity, articulated in religious idiom, dominated Ulster unionist hostility to home rule. That home rule meant Rome Rule was, for the average Ulster Protestant, conclusive condemnation of any tampering with the union. Rome Rule conjured the nightmare of a native rising for a settler community. Economic factors merely reinforced racial pride.

Her Protestant majority became fearful of one day finding herself dominated by a Roman Catholic Parliament in Dublin:
* They saw Catholic priests playing a big role in the pro-Home Rule IPP branches.
* Would Home Rule, they wondered, become &quot;Rome Rule&quot;, with Catholic bishops telling Catholic MPs how to vote?
* Might Irish Protestants not thereby lose their civil and religious liberty?

This was the background against which the English Conservative Party played the &quot;Orange Card.&quot; Lord Randolph Churchill played it with gusto. In 1886, the year of Gladstone&#x27;s first Home Rule Bill, Churchill crossed to Belfast to make an inflammatory anti-Home Rule speech in the Ulster Hall, and a little later, coined the memorable phrase, &quot;Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right&quot;&quot;&quot;.

Parnell&#x27;s political opponents pointed out that he was the only non-Catholic MP in his party. To avoid further accusations about Rome Rule, he nominated six other non-Catholics for safe seats (out of the IPP&#x27;s new total of 85 MPs) in the 1886 election.

===Other elements===
As the Irish nationalist movement recovered in the 1890s from the division caused by Parnell&#x27;s relationship with Mrs O&#x27;Shea, it embraced Gaelic games and a growing Irish language revival movement, which were often encouraged by the Catholic Church for the good of its parishioners, but which also alienated Irish Protestants. The fate of Bridget Cleary in 1895 suggested that many rural Irish Catholics were still unduly superstitious. An &quot;Irish-Ireland&quot; ideology of nationalism was developed by David Moran, who stated in 1905 that it was essential to be Catholic to be Irish.

The resurgent Church&#x27;s dogma on the Syllabus of Errors (1864) and Papal infallibility (1871) were unattractive. For observant Protestants, the encyclical &quot;Apostolicae Curae&quot; in 1896 had simply denied the validity of the Anglican hierarchy. In 1907 Modernism was proscribed in &quot;Pascendi dominici gregis&quot; and &quot;Lamentabili sane&quot;, indicating that no Protestant, being a heretic, could ever be well regarded by a Catholic-led government.

Opponents of Home Rule could also quote from several anti-clerical books by Margaret Cusack, the founder of The Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace, who had then converted to Protestantism in 1887. In &quot;The Nun of Kenmare: An Autobiography&quot; (1889), Cusack complained that she had been vilified by her fellow churchmen behind her back: &quot;The practice of the Inquisition still holds in the Roman church, as I have found again and again, and as this book will show. You are condemned unheard.&quot;

The &quot;Ne Temere&quot; papal decree of 1907 required non-Catholics married to a Catholic to agree to educate their children as Catholics, and often the non-Catholic was required to convert before the marriage. &quot;Ne Temere&quot; was tolerated by the UK parliament as it had little impact in Britain; Irish Protestants felt that it would have a much greater impact in a future Catholic-dominated Home Rule Ireland. In 1911 debates, both views were considered, and notably, those against &quot;Ne Temere&quot; were unionists and those tolerating it were not.

From 1898 the &quot;Index&quot;, or list of books forbidden to Catholics, was modified by Pope Leo XIII. Along with indecent works it still included forbidden authors such as Jonathan Swift and Daniel Defoe, and the scientists John Locke and Galileo, that most Europeans would by then have found unobjectionable.

==Socialist theorists on Rome Rule==
The English socialist organiser Harry Quelch wrote in his 1902 essay, &quot;Home Rule and Rome Rule&quot;:

The Irish socialist and nationalist James Connolly wrote much about religion and politics, but did not consider the insecurities of Irish loyalists. His optimistic view in 1910 was that the Catholic Church would accommodate itself with an Irish &quot;Workers&#x27; Republic&quot;, and so Rome Rule could never occur:

==1912–1925==

The phrase took on a new lease of life from the introduction of the Third Home Rule Bill in April 1912. Ulster loyalist opponents of Home Rule formed the Ulster Volunteers and their opponents in the rest of Ireland set up the Irish Volunteers in 1913. Both paramilitary groups imported arms, and by mid-1914 it seemed likely that an Irish civil war would erupt, with people&#x27;s allegiances based largely, if not primarily, on their parents&#x27; religions.

The Protestants&#x27; fears about a Dublin Parliament may seem to have been exaggerated at the time, but the history of Ireland since independence has, on the whole, tended to suggest that they were not. &quot;Home Rule&quot;, they declared, &quot;would be Rome Rule, and that was all there was to it&quot;. &quot;It may seem strange to you and me,&quot; Bonar Law told Lord Riddell, &quot;but it is a religious question. Those people are . . . . prepared to die for their convictions&quot;.

Indeed, occasional speeches by leading Nationalists designed to allay Liberal fears that &quot;Home Rule really would be Rome Rule&quot;, were in 1911 on the other hand making some Catholic churchmen anxious. Welcome as the reward of Home Rule would be, the question arose: Are they not more likely, to have as their reward secularism in the schools? 

The nationalist view was also indicatively divergent: Our home was a Catholic household; all the children were at Catholic schools and the Catholic university, so all the children’s friends were Catholics, and all my grandmother’s subtle match-making and her ambition’s pre-supposed Catholic dynasties. &quot;Home Rule means Rome Rule&quot; said the Ulster Protestant slogan. Not at all. ...It was &quot;our people&quot;, neither Rome nor the Protestant ascendancy, who should rule in Ireland. &quot;Our people&quot;, through an élite, sprung from it, trained for its service, ...The Jesuits were helping to train such an élite.

The envisaged threat from both Home Rule and Rome was expressed in an angry poem by Rudyard Kipling, &quot;Ulster 1912,&quot; 4th verse:
’We know the war prepared&lt;br&gt;On every peaceful home,&lt;br&gt;We know the hells declared&lt;br&gt;For such as serve not Rome.&quot;&quot;

It so happened that Pius X was Pope in 1903–1914, the period when the policies of Ulster unionism were cast. His general policy of church supremacy led to antagonism across Europe between secular governments and his Church. Unlike other Catholic churches in Europe, such as in Spain or Portugal, the Irish Church was no longer semi-autonomous but had been assigned in 1833 to the Congregation of Missions in Rome. As a result, the Irish Church could be governed under canon law by the relatively informal motu proprio system. Concern about this led to proposals for safeguards in the debates that led to the Home Rule Act 1914.

Loyalists were unspecific about the likely effect of &quot;Rome Rule&quot;, but it became an effective slogan in maintaining the loyalty of the Protestant working class, and contributed to the lack of trust which caused the near-civil war prior to the Government of Ireland Act 1914 and the Partition of Ireland during 1914–25. From the Easter Rising in 1916 on, a number of prominent Nationalist Protestants or lapsed Catholics even felt the need to conform to be considered fully involved in the nationalist movement.

During the Irish War of Independence the Irish Republic sought international recognition from other countries, including the Holy See. Its envoy Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly wrote to Pope Benedict XV in 1920 in terms suggesting that the war was a part of a long religious struggle, and identifying the Irish Republic with &quot;Catholic Ireland&quot;. The letter was not published until recently; it included:

After 1922 Northern Ireland on the other hand was clear about where it stood, boasting itself to be A Protestant parliament for a Protestant people. The term Rome Rule was occasionally used as a disparaging term by anti-clerical socialists in Ireland who opposed the Church&#x27;s views on social policy. In a campaign against Ireland&#x27;s laws forbidding contraception, the Irish feminist Mary Kenny stated in 1971 that – &quot;Ian Paisley was right; Home Rule is Rome Rule&quot;.

In 2009 Professor Ronan Fanning of UCD considered that: &quot;...in an overwhelmingly Catholic Ireland, the old Unionist taunt that Home Rule would mean Rome Rule had no force because Rome Rule had become more a cause for pride than for shame.&quot;

<text>Sergei Donatovich Dovlatov (; 1941 1990) was a Soviet journalist and writer. Internationally, he is one of the most popular Russian writers of the late 20th century.

==Biography==

Dovlatov was born on 3 September 1941 in Ufa, the capital of Bashkir ASSR in the Soviet Union, where his family had been evacuated in the beginning of World War II from Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) and lived with a collaborator of The People&#x27;s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) for three years. His mother, Nora Dovlatova, was Armenian and worked as a proofreader, and his father, , was Jewish and a theater director.

After 1944, he lived with his mother in Leningrad. Dovlatov studied at the Finnish Department of Leningrad State University, but flunked after two and a half years. There, he became acquainted with the Leningrad poets Yevgeny Rein, Anatoly Naiman, Joseph Brodsky, the writer Sergey Wolf, and the artist Alexander Ney.

He was drafted into the Soviet Internal Troops and served as a prison guard in high-security camps. Later, he earned his living as a journalist in various newspapers and magazines in Leningrad and then as a correspondent of the Tallinn newspaper &quot;Sovetskaya Estonia&quot; (Советская Эстония/Soviet Estonia). He supplemented his income by being a summer tour guide in Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve, a museum near Pskov dedicated to Alexander Pushkin. Dovlatov wrote prose fiction, but his numerous attempts to get published in the Soviet Union were in vain.

Unable to publish in the Soviet Union, Dovlatov circulated his writings through samizdat and by having them smuggled into Western Europe for publication in foreign journals; an activity that caused his expulsion from the Union of Soviet Journalists in 1976. The Western Russian-Language magazines which published his work include &quot;Continent&quot; and &quot;Time and Us.&quot; The typeset &#x27;formes&#x27; of his first book were destroyed under the order of the KGB.

In 1979, Dovlatov emigrated from the Soviet Union with his mother, Nora, and came to live with his wife and daughter in New York City, where he later co-edited &quot;The New American&quot;, a liberal, Russian-language émigré newspaper. In the early 1980s, Dovlatov finally achieved recognition as a writer, being printed in the prestigious magazine &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Dovlatov died of heart failure on 24 August 1990 in New York City and was buried at the Mount Hebron Cemetery.

==Works==
Dovlatov published twelve books in the United States and Europe during his twelve years as an immigrant. In the USSR, the writer was known from underground publication samizdat and broadcasting organization Radio Liberty Channel since his works were not published in the Soviet Union. After his death and the beginning of Perestroika as a turning point in the Russian history, numerous collections of his short stories were also published in Russia.

Published during his lifetime:

* &quot;Notebooks&quot; (Записные книжки) — New York: Слово — Word, 1990.
* &quot;Affiliate&quot; (Филиал) — New York: Слово — Word, 1990.

==Critical perception==
Joseph Brodsky said of Dovlatov, &quot;He is the only Russian writer whose works will be read all the way through&quot; and that: &quot;The decisive thing is his tone, which every member of a democratic society can recognize: the individual who won&#x27;t let himself be cast in the role of a victim, who is not obsessed with what makes him different.&quot;

== Literary style ==

Dovlatov&#x27;s rule that, as he said, &quot;limited the prosaic just like rhyme limits the poet&quot;, was to build the sentences so that there were no two words that started with the same letter. Thus his sentences are mostly short and simple, rarely containing clauses.

As he expressed in &quot;Craft: A Story in Two Parts&quot; (1985), his idol was Ernest Hemingway, at least in earlier literary life, and his works were largely autobiographic, reminiscent of Hemingway&#x27;s style. Later, he became much fascinated and influenced by Joseph Brodsky, whom he knew well personally.

== Legacy ==
On 26 June 2014, the New York City Council named the intersection of 63rd Drive and 108th Street &quot;Sergei Dovlatov Way&quot;. The petition to request this honor was signed by 18,000 people; in the same year a new edition, translated by his daughter Katherine Dovlatov, of the author&#x27;s &#x27;Pushkin Hills&#x27; was published. The work was nominated for Best Translated Book Award. The opening ceremony was held at the corner of 108th Street and 63rd Drive on 7 September 2014; three Russian television news stations recorded the event and the celebration continued at the late author&#x27;s home nearby.

A biographical film about Sergei Dovlatov was released in 2018. This film was in competition in the Berlinale 2018.

<doc id="409490" wikidata="Q448992" url="?curid=409490" title="Dorothy Wordsworth">
<text>Dorothy Mae Ann Wordsworth (25 December 1771 – 25 January 1855) was an English author, poet, and diarist. She was the sister of the Romantic poet William Wordsworth, and the two were close all their adult lives. Dorothy Wordsworth had no ambitions to be a public author, yet she left behind numerous letters, diary entries, topographical descriptions, poems, and other writings.

== Early life and education ==
Dorothy Wordsworth was born in Cockermouth, Cumberland on December 25, 1771. She was the sister of English Romantic poet William Wordsworth and the third of five children born to Ann Cookson and John Wordsworth. Following the death of her mother in 1778, Dorothy was sent alone to live with her second cousin, Elizabeth Threlkeld, in Halifax, West Yorkshire until 1787. During this period, Dorothy attended boarding school at Hipperholme before transferring to a day-school in Halifax.

In 1787, Dorothy moved to her grandparents&#x27; house in Penrith, re-establishing contact with her siblings after a nine-year separation. She moved to Forncett parish in Norfolk in 1788 with her recently wedded uncle and his wife, where she remained for six years. Dorothy dedicated her time to domestic duties and corresponded regularly to her brother William and her childhood friend, Jane Pollard. In a letter to Jane, Dorothy mentioned starting a small school consisting of nine local girls. William spent six weeks in Forncett at the end of 1790, during which time the Wordsworth siblings began their enduring practice of undertaking long walks together. Dorothy and William maintained a close bond throughout their lives.

In 1794, Dorothy was reunited with William after a three-year separation. The siblings resided at Old Windebrowe cottage for a period of two months. They later relocated to Racedown Lodge in Dorset, where they remained until 1797. During their time at Racedown, they began fostering a three-year-old boy named Basil Montagu. It was during this period that Dorothy was introduced to the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whom William had briefly encountered two years prior, and from here the trio developed a close friendship. Coleridge wrote of Dorothy&#x27;s character in a letter to his publisher: &quot;Her information various—her eye watchful in minutest observation of nature&quot;.

== Alfoxden and Grasmere ==
In July of 1797, despite facing financial constraints, Dorothy and William Wordsworth relocated to Alfoxton House in Somerset, a short distance from their new acquaintance Coleridge&#x27;s residence. Together, Wordsworth and Coleridge, with insights from Dorothy, collaborated on &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (1798). Among the collection is Wordsworth&#x27;s famous poem &quot;Tintern Abbey,&quot; inspired by their walking tour through Wye Valley in July 1798. In the poem&#x27;s final section, Wordsworth writes of Dorothy: &quot;For thou art with me, here, upon the banks \ Of this fair river; thou, my dearest Friend&quot;. 

The Wordsworths&#x27; stay at Alfoxton House was brief due to their financial difficulties. Dorothy began her &quot;Alfoxden Journal&quot; from January to May 1798, for which the manuscript is now lost. Subsequently, Dorothy, William, and Coleridge traveled to Germany in 1798, where Dorothy penned her &quot;Hamburgh Journal.&quot; 

In December of 1799, Dorothy and William settled in Dove Cottage, located in Grasmere within England’s Lake District, where they resided until May of 1808. Dorothy&#x27;s &quot;Grasmere Journal,&quot; first published in 1897 and edited by William Angus Knight, provides a glimpse into their life during this period. Starting in 1800 and concluding with the completion of a notebook in 1803, the journal captures Dorothy&#x27;s daily experiences in the Lake District. It recounts their countryside walks and offers detailed portraits of notable literary figures of the early 19th century, such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Lamb, and Robert Southey. The Grasmere journals are considered fragmentary in nature and were originally intended for an audience consisting mainly of William and a select few close friends and family members.

== Rydal and her final years ==
In 1802, Dorothy journeyed with William to Gallow Hill, Yorkshire for his marriage to Mary Hutchinson. Dorothy did not attend the wedding ceremony. After their marriage, the Wordsworth siblings, with the addition of William’s new wife, returned to Grasmere. Dorothy played a devoted role in the lives of William and Mary&#x27;s children born in the following years. In 1803, Dorothy joined William and Samuel Taylor Coleridge on a six-week tour of the Scottish Highlands. This journey inspired her to pen &quot;Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland&quot;, which was, according to Dorothy, written for &quot;the sake of a few friends, who, it seemed, ought to have been with us.&quot; She concluded her renowned &quot;Grasmere Journal&quot; in the same year.

The Wordsworths settled in Rydal Mount in 1813, where Dorothy resided for the remainder of her life. Alongside her friend Mary Barker, Dorothy ascended Scafell Pike in 1818, an experience she documented in &quot;An Excursion up Scawfell Pike.&quot; Additionally, she embarked on a continental tour of the Alps in 1820, documenting her travels in &quot;Journal of a Tour on the Continent&quot;. The following years saw Dorothy engaging in further explorations, including tours of the Scottish Highlands and Edinburgh, resulting in &quot;Journal of my Second Tour in Scotland, 1822&quot;.

From 1824 to 1835, Dorothy wrote of daily events, with frequent gaps, in her &quot;Rydal Journals&quot;. These journals, apart from the &quot;Isle of Man&quot; sequence, have not yet been published. In 1829, Dorothy fell seriously ill, followed by a brief recovery period and eventual relapse in 1831. Despite battling a degenerative illness, Dorothy continued writing, including compositions later published in William Wordsworth&#x27;s collections. Due to her health, Dorothy was cared for by her brother William, his wife Mary, and the Rydal staff. Following William&#x27;s passing in April 1850, Dorothy&#x27;s health continued to decline until her death on 25 January 1855.

== Writing ==
Wordsworth was primarily a diarist, and she also wrote poetry though without much interest in becoming an established poet. She almost published her account of traveling in Scotland with William and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1803, &quot;Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland&quot;, but a publisher was not found, and it would not be published until 1874.

She wrote a very early account of an ascent of Scafell Pike in 1818, climbing the mountain in the company of her friend Mary Barker, Miss Barker&#x27;s maid, and two local people to act as guide and porter. Dorothy&#x27;s work was used in 1822 (and later in 1823 and 1835) by her brother William, unattributed, in his popular guide book to the Lake District – and this was then copied by Harriet Martineau in her equally successful guide (in its fourth edition by 1876), but with attribution, if only to William Wordsworth. The account was quoted in other guidebooks as well. Consequently, this story was very widely read by the many visitors to the Lake District over more than half of the 19th century.
The &quot;Grasmere Journal&quot; and Dorothy&#x27;s other works revealed how vital she was to her brother&#x27;s success. William relied on her detailed accounts of nature scenes and borrowed freely from her journals. He drew inspiration from Dorothy&#x27;s journal entry of the sibling&#x27;s encounter with a field of daffodils:

In his poem, &quot;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,&quot; William describes what appears to be the shared experience in the journal as his own solitary observation. Dorothy&#x27;s observations and descriptions have been considered to be as poetic if not more so than those of her brother. In her time she was described as being one of the few writers who could have provided so vivid and picturesque a scene.

== Critical reception ==
Dorothy Wordsworth&#x27;s works came to light just as literary critics were beginning to re-examine women&#x27;s role in literature. The success of the &quot;Grasmere Journal&quot; led to a renewed interest in Wordsworth, and several other journals and collections of her letters have since been published. Scholar Anne Mellor has identified Wordsworth as demonstrating a &quot;model of affiliation rather than a model of individual achievement&quot;, more commonly associated with Romanticism.

<doc id="409496" wikidata="Q1131308" url="?curid=409496" title="Mamma Mia (ABBA song)">
<text>&quot;Mamma Mia&quot; is a song by the Swedish pop group ABBA, written by Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson, with the lead vocals shared by Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. It is the opening track on the group&#x27;s third album, the self-titled &quot;ABBA&quot; (1975). The song was released in September 1975 as its sixth single. It tells the story of the narrator&#x27;s on-again, off-again relationship with a lover who is repeatedly unfaithful to her. The song&#x27;s name is derived from Italian and literally translates as &quot;my mother&quot;, but is used as an interjection (&quot;Mamma mia!&quot;) in situations of surprise, anguish, or excitement. The song was ABBA&#x27;s first number one in the UK since &quot;Waterloo&quot; in 1974.

==History and impact==
The distinctive sound at the start of the song is the marimba. According to biographer Carl Magnus Palm, the instrument was incorporated at the last minute, added after Benny Andersson found it in the studio and decided its &quot;tick tock&quot; rhythm was perfect for the track.

&quot;Mamma Mia&quot; was written at the home of Agnetha Fältskog and Björn Ulvaeus, and was the last track recorded for the album &quot;ABBA&quot;. It was one of four songs from the album to have a music video made to promote the album. Initially, however, &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; was never intended for release as a single. Around this time, many artists were recording ABBA songs (such as &quot;Honey, Honey&quot; and &quot;Bang a Boomerang&quot;). ABBA offered &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; to British pop group Brotherhood of Man, who turned it down.

&quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot; topped the Australian charts for three weeks; however, the promo clip for &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; proved the more popular after repeat screenings on Australian television, notably on the show &quot;Countdown&quot;. ABBA&#x27;s Australian record company, RCA, asked that &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; be released as a single but Polar Music refused, preferring them to release &quot;SOS&quot; first. However, Stig Anderson agreed to this; &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; was released in Australia in August 1975, where it spent 10 weeks at number one. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said the single was &quot;an example of [ABBA&#x27;s] excellent musical taste,&quot; stating that the &quot;tune is upbeat, with characteristically varied textures.&quot;

After this success in Australia, Epic Records in the United Kingdom took notice of ABBA for the first time since their Eurovision Song Contest winner &quot;Waterloo&quot;. From then on, Epic began to heavily promote ABBA&#x27;s singles with the immediate result of &quot;SOS&quot; reaching the Top 10 in the British market, their first hit since &quot;Waterloo&quot;. &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; soon followed, reaching number one in the UK Singles Chart in January 1976, the second of ABBA&#x27;s 18 consecutive Top 10 singles there.

&quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;the reason [the song is a worldwide smash] should be self-explanatory after just one listen.&quot;

The B-side for the Australian release of &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; was &quot;Hey, Hey Helen&quot;. In most other countries the B-side was the instrumental &quot;Intermezzo Number 1&quot;. ABBA&#x27;s British label Epic selected &quot;Tropical Loveland&quot; as the B-side for the UK release, believing another vocal track, especially one showcasing ABBA in a different musical style, would better promote the parent album.

In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; number seven on their list of the 15 greatest ABBA songs, and in 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song number five on their list of the 25 greatest ABBA songs.

As of September 2021, it is ABBA&#x27;s seventh-biggest song in the UK with 860,000 chart sales (pure sales and digital streams).

==A-Teens version==

Swedish pop group A-Teens released their version of &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; as their debut single on 30 April 1999 through Stockholm Records. It is from their debut album, &quot;The ABBA Generation&quot; (1999).

Upon its release, it became a smash hit in Sweden, where it peaked at number one and stayed there for eight consecutive weeks, earning a quadruple platinum certification.

On initial pressings of the single, the name of the group appeared as ABBA-Teens, but Stockholm Records thought it would be better to change the name of the band to A-Teens, so new pressings of the single were made.

===Commercial performance===
The single reached the top 20 in several European countries, reaching number three in Norway, number nine in Switzerland and the Netherlands, number 10 in Germany, number 12 in the United Kingdom, and number 14 in Austria and Finland. A Spanish version of the song was recorded for promotion in Latin America and Spain. Despite the worldwide success, the song failed to attract the Australian public, peaking at 72 on the ARIA Singles Chart, although it did reach number 13 in New Zealand.

In the United States, the single peaked at 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Single Sales Chart, becoming the band&#x27;s first single to chart in the country.

===Music video===
The accompanying music video was directed by Henrik Sylvén and was filmed in Sweden. It shows the A-Teens as waiters at an art exposition, and they are suppressed by the manager; but soon they discover that one of the paintings transports them to a party where the manager and patrons he is helping also join in on the fun.

<text>The Church of God General Conference (CoGGC) is a nontrinitarian, Adventist Christian body also known as the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith. The Church of the Blessed Hope, some of whose congregations also use the name Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith (CGAF), are a separate denomination, although they share the same origins.

==History==

The Church of God General Conference has roots in several similar groups in North America that eventually united in 1921 in Waterloo, Iowa, to form the current national organization. These small groups had reached similar doctrinal convictions through independent Bible study. In the mid-19th century, some of the individuals and groups, including Joseph Marsh of New York, Nathaniel Field of Indiana, and the Wilson family of Illinois (Benjamin Wilson&#x27;s family), began to circulate religious writings which made the groups aware of one another. This led to fellowship, the development of state conferences, and an attempted national organization in 1888. Strong convictions on the autonomy and authority of individual congregations, though, led to the demise of the original attempt. In 1921 the groups divided, with the larger becoming the Church of God General Conference, and the smaller the Church of the Blessed Hope. The Church of the Blessed Hope held to the beliefs shared by Benjamin Wilson, and the Church of God General Conference expanded their belief system to embrace doctrines (e.g. the existence of a personal Devil) previously not held by the group Wilson helped co-found.

==Doctrines==
Doctrines of the Church of God General Conference include belief in the authority of the Bible as the rule of faith, one God, who is the Father, Jesus is God&#x27;s Son, who came into existence beginning with his miraculous conception in Mary&#x27;s womb, repentance is lifelong change, the literal premillennial second coming of Jesus Christ, those who have accepted the gospel will be resurrected at the return of Christ, and promises of God to Abraham will be literally fulfilled, referred to as the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; being established on Earth.

===Statement of Faith===
The Church of God General Conference statement of faith states, and Atlanta Bible College advocates as follows:
* the oneness of God (1 Cor. 8:6)
* that the Holy Spirit is God&#x27;s power (Acts 1:8)
* Jesus Christ is God&#x27;s only begotten Son (Matt. 16:16), and is our Mediator (1 Tim. 2:5)
* the Bible is the inspired Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16)
* the mortality of man (Job 4:17; Psa. 146:4)
* the near return of Christ (Acts 1:11), and life only through Him (Col. 3:3)
* the literal resurrection of the dead (John 5:28, 29)
* the immortalization of those in Christ (1 Cor. 15:53, 54)
* the destruction of the wicked (Rev. 21:8)
* the final restoration of Israel as the Kingdom of God under the kingship of Christ (Luke 1:32)
* the church to be joint heirs with Christ (Rom. 8:17), and Israel to be made head over Gentile nations (Isa. 60:13)
* the &quot;restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of His holy prophets since the world began&quot; (Acts 3:21)
* it also firmly advocates repentance and immersion in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins (Acts 2:38), and a consecrated life as essential to salvation (Heb. 12:14)

===Other doctrines===
A significant distinctive doctrine of the Church of God General Conference is denial of the personal pre-existence of Jesus Christ, but acceptance of the virgin birth; a position in Christology historically known as Socinianism, although adherents of this view today often prefer the term &quot;Biblical Unitarianism&quot;.
The main distinguishing doctrinal difference between Church of God General Conference (CoGGC) and Christadelphians and Church of the Blessed Hope (CGAF) is that the majority of CoGGC members believe that Satan is a literal fallen angel, although a minority do not. Anthony Buzzard of Atlanta Bible College has debated Christadelphians and written defending the traditional view of the devil. However, there is no mention of the devil in the CoGGC Statement of Faith, and this doctrine is not considered a fundamental.

==Organization==
The &quot;Churches of God&quot; are congregational in government, yet cooperate in publications and missions ministries, and the Atlanta Bible College. International headquarters are located in McDonough in Henry County, Georgia in the metro-Atlanta area. &quot;The Restitution Herald&quot; is the official periodical of the church, and is published bi-monthly. A journal dealing with the doctrines of the movement, &quot;A Journal From the Radical Reformation&quot;, has been published quarterly since 1991. The &quot;Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches&quot; states the Church of God General Conference had 89 churches and 5,018 members in 2002. The 2010 US Religion Census listed the CoGGC as having 3,842 members in 84 churches. Korean Extension: The Korean Extension is a Korean ministry of the Atlanta Bible College. The Korean Extension was officially started in the fall semester of the 2003 school year by Pastor Steve An. The Korean Extension is led by Pastors Steve An &amp; Sam An, and the campus is located in Duluth, Georgia. As of the year 2010 there are approximately 100 students in the Atlanta Bible College Korean Extension.
