<text>The Kashmiri Pandits (also known as Kashmiri Brahmins) are a group of Kashmiri Hindus and a part of the larger Saraswat Brahmin community of India. They belong to the Pancha Gauda Brahmin group from the Kashmir Valley, located within the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
Kashmiri Pandits are Hindu Kashmiris native to the Kashmir Valley, and the only remaining Hindu Kashmiris after the large-scale conversion of the Valley&#x27;s population to Islam during medieval times. Prompted by the growth of Islamic militancy in the valley, large numbers left in the exodus of the 1990s. Even so, small numbers remain.

==History==
===Early history===

The Hindu caste system of the Kashmir region was influenced by the influx of Buddhism from the time of Asoka, around the third century BCE, and a consequence of this was that the traditional lines of varna were blurred, with the exception of that for the Brahmins. Another notable feature of early Kashmiri society was the relative high regard in which women were held when compared to their position in other communities of the period.

A historically contested region, Northern India was subject to attack from Turkic and Arab regimes from the eighth century onwards, but they generally ignored the mountain-circled Kashmir Valley in favour of easier pickings elsewhere. It was not until the fourteenth century that Muslim rule was finally established in the Valley and when this happened it did not occur primarily as a consequence of invasion so much as because of internal problems resulting from the weak rule and corruption endemic in the Hindu Lohara dynasty. Mohibbul Hasan describes this collapse as 

The Brahmins had something to be particularly unhappy about during the reign of the last Lohara king, for Sūhadeva chose to include them in his system of onerous taxation, whereas previously they appear to have been exempted.

===Medieval history===
Zulju, who was probably a Mongol from Turkistan, wreaked devastation in 1320, when he commanded a force that conquered many regions of the Kashmir Valley. However, Zulju was probably not a Muslim. The actions of Sultan Sikandar Butshikan (1389–1413), the seventh Muslim ruler in Kashmir were also significant to the area. The Sultan has been referred to as an iconoclast because of his destruction of many non-Muslim religious symbols and the manner in which he forced the population to convert or flee. Many followers of the traditional religions who did not convert to Islam instead migrated to other parts of India. The migrants included some Pandits, although it is possible that some of this community relocated for economic reasons as much as to escape the new rulers. Brahmins were at that time generally being offered grants of land in other areas by rulers seeking to utilise the traditionally high literacy and general education of the community, as well as the legitimacy conferred upon them by association. The outcome of this shift both in population and in religion was that the Kashmir Valley became a predominantly Muslim region. It was during the 14th century that the Kashmiri Pandits likely split into their three subcastes: Guru/Bāchabat (priests), Jotish (astrologers), and Kārkun (who were historically mainly employed by the government). The majority of Kashmiri Brahmins are Kārkuns, and this is likely due to the conversion of the majority of Kashmiris to Islam, which led to a decrease in demand for Hindu priests, which led most Kashmiri Brahmins to seek secular employment.

Butshikan&#x27;s heir, the devout Muslim Zain-ul-Abidin (1423–74), was tolerant of Hindus to the extent of sanctioning a return to Hinduism of those who had been forcibly converted to the Muslim faith, as well as becoming involved in the restoration of temples. He respected the learning of these Pandits, to whom he gave land as well as encouraging those who had left to return. He operated a meritocracy and both Brahmins and Buddhists were among his closest advisors.

===Modern history===

====Early modern====
====Modern====
D.L. Sheth, the former director of the Center for the Study of Developing Societies in India (CSDS), lists Indian communities that constituted the middle class and were traditionally &quot;Urban and professional&quot; (following professions like doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, etc.) immediately after Independence in 1947. This list included the Kashmiri Pandits, the Nagar Brahmins from Gujarat; the South Indian Brahmins; the Punjabi Khatris, and Kayasthas from northern India; Chitpawans and CKPs (Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus) from Maharashtra; the Probasi and the Bhadralok Bengalis; the Parsis and the upper crusts of Muslim and Christian communities. According to P.K. Verma, &quot;Education was a common thread that bound together this pan Indian elite&quot; and almost all the members of these communities could read and write English and were educated beyond school.

==Recent events==

===Exodus from Kashmir (1989–1995)===

The Kashmiri Pandits had been a favoured section of the population of the valley during Dogra rule (1846–1947). 20 per cent of them left the valley as a consequence of the 1950 land reforms, and by 1981 the Pandit population amounted to 5 per cent of the total.

They began to leave in much greater numbers in the 1990s during the eruption of militancy, following persecution and threats by radical Islamists and militants. The events of 19 January 1990 were particularly vicious. On that day, mosques issued declarations that the Kashmiri Pandits were Kafirs and that the males had to leave Kashmir, convert to Islam or be killed. Those who chose to the first of these were told to leave their women behind. The Kashmiri Muslims were instructed to identify Pandit homes so they could be systematically targeted for conversion or killing.

According to a number of authors, approximately 100,000 of the total Kashmiri Pandit population of 140,000 left the valley during the 1990s. Other authors have suggested a higher figure for the exodus, ranging from the entire population of over 150,000, to 190,000 of a total Pandit population of 200,000, to a number as high as 800,000. Many of the refugee Kashmiri Pandits have been living in abject conditions in refugee camps of Jammu. The government has reported on the terrorist threats to Pandits still living in the Kashmir region.

Some Hindus across India tried to help the Pandits. Bal Thackeray from Maharashtra got seats reserved in engineering colleges for the children of these Pandits. He was one of the first persons to help them after which Punjab also followed suit.

In 2009 the Oregon Legislative Assembly passed a resolution to recognise 14 September 2007, as Martyrs Day to acknowledge ethnic cleansing and campaigns of terror inflicted on non-Muslim minorities of Jammu and Kashmir by terrorists seeking to establish an Islamic state.

In 2010, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir noted that 808 Pandit families, comprising 3,445 people, were still living in the Valley and that financial and other incentives put in place to encourage others to return there had been unsuccessful. According to a J&amp;K government report, 219 members of the community had been killed in the region between 1989 and 2004 but none thereafter. The local organisation of pandits in Kashmir, Kashmir Pandit Sangharsh Samiti after carrying out a survey in 2008 and 2009, said that 399 Kashmiri Pandits were killed by insurgents from 1990 to 2011 with 75% of them being killed during the first year of the Kashmiri insurgency.

The exiled community had hoped to return after the situation improved. They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives.

As of October 2015, only 1 Kashmiri Pandit family returned to the Kashmir valley since 1990 according to the Jammu &amp; Kashmir government despite the financial assistance being given for rehabilitation. As of 2016, a total of 1,800 Kashmiri Pandit youths have returned to the valley since the announcing of Rs. 1,168-crore package in 2008 by the UPA government.

===PRC and the JKMIP Acts===

There are zones set up with offices for relief. Many Orders, Circulars and recommendations have been issued for relief of Kashmiri Pandits.

The Jammu And Kashmir Migrant Immovable Property (Preservation, Protection And Restraint on Distress Sales) Act, 1997, provides that &quot;Any person who is an unauthorised occupant or recipient of any usufruct of any immovable property of the migrant shall pay to the migrant such compensation for the period of unauthorised occupation and in such a manner as may be determined by the District Magistrate.&quot;

===Socio-political organisations===

Following the migration of the Kashmiri Pandit community, various socio-political organisations have sprung up to represent the cause of the displaced community. The most prominent among these are the All India Kashmiri Samaj or AIKS, All India Kashmiri Pandit conference, &quot;Panun Kashmir&quot; &amp; &quot;Kashmiri Samiti&quot;. These organisations are involved in rehabilitation of the community in the valley through peace negotiations, mobilisation of human rights groups and job creation for the Pandits.

Panun Kashmir has made demands for a separate homeland for the community in the southern part of Kashmir. Ikkjutt Jammu, a political party in Jammu and Kashmir, advocates for two Union Territories in Kashmir, one being Panun Kashmir for Kashmiri Hindus.

==Population distribution==

According to the 1941 census, there were 78,800 Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir Valley. They were distributed into the two districts of Valley, the Baramulla district, where Hindus constituted 2.1 per cent of the population; 12,919 Hindus out of 612,428 total. and the Anantnag district, where they were 7.84 per cent of the population.

Scholar Christopher Snedden states that the Pandits made up about 6 per cent of the Kashmir Valley&#x27;s population in 1947. By 1950, their population declined to 5 per cent as many Pandits moved to other parts of India due to the uncompensated land redistribution policy, the unsettled nature of Kashmir&#x27;s accession to India and the threat of economic and social decline.

In the 1981 census, the Kashmir Division had 124,078 Hindus, the majority of whom were Pandits. Scholar Alexander Evans estimates by 1990, there would have been 160,000–170,000 Pandits in the Kashmir Valley.

Following the 1989 insurgency, a great majority of Pandits felt threatened and left the Kashmir Valley for other parts of India. A large number settled in the Jammu Division of the State and the National Capital Region of India. Some emigrated to other countries entirely.
By 2011, only an estimated 2,700-3,400 Pandits remained in the Kashmir Valley.

According to Indian government, more than 60,000 families are registered as Kashmiri migrants including some Sikh and Muslim families. Most families were resettled in Jammu, NCR and other neighbouring states.

==Society and culture==
===Religious beliefs===

Kashmir has also been a land of Sun worship with shrines such as Martand Sun Temple established by Lalitaditya Muktapida. Sun worship is believed to have been brought into Kashmir by Kushan kings from Iran. Lalitaditya&#x27;s predecessor, Ranaditya, is said to have built the first sun temple. Wanvun singing is an integral part of Kashmiri Pandit religious ceremonies.

====Pilgrimage sites====

Harmukh is traditionally revered by Kashmiri Pandits and in 2009 there was an attempt by them to revive pilgrimages to the site. The &quot;Mata Kheerbhawani&quot; temple shrine in Srinagar, considered one of the holiest Hindu shrines, saw the largest gathering of Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir valley in 2012. The shrine is located in Tullamulla village, 24 km from Srinagar in Ganderbal district.

====Festivals====

The Kashmiri Pandits festivals include Shivratri (or &quot;Herath&quot; in the Kashmiri language) which is one of the major festivals of Kashmiri Pandits. &quot;Navreh&quot; or the Kashmiri lunar new year is also an important Pandit festival.

===Culture===
====Dress====
Kshemendra&#x27;s detailed records from the eleventh century describe many items of which the precise nature is unknown. It is clear that tunics known as &quot;kanchuka&quot; were worn long-sleeved by men and in both long- and half-sleeved versions by women. Caps were worn, as well as a type of turban referred to as a &quot;shirahshata&quot;, while footwear consisted of leather shoes and boots, worn with socks. Some items were elaborate, such as the peacock shoes – known as &quot;mayuropanah&quot; – worn by followers of fashion, and steel-soled shoes adorned with floral designs, lubricated internally with beeswax. They also wear the mekhalā, which is a type of girdle.

There are many references to the wearing of jewellery by both sexes, but a significant omission from them is any record of the &quot;dejihor&quot; worn on the ear by women today as a symbol of their being married. Kaw has speculated that this item of jewellery may not have existed at the time. The texts also refer to both sexes using cosmetics, and to the women adopting elaborate hairstyles. Men, too, might adopt stylish arrangements and wear flowers in their hair, if they had the financial means to do so.

====Music====
Henzae is an ancient traditional form of singing practised by Kashmiri Pandits at their festivals. It appears to have archaic features that suggest it is the oldest form of Kashmiri folk singing.

====Diet====
The Kashmiri Pandits have a tradition of consuming meat, including mutton and fish, but they obey restrictions laid down by the &quot;shastras&quot; of not eating the meat of forbidden animals such as beef and pork. Frederick J. Simoons says that according to some reports, Kashmiri Pandits also consume fish as part of their diet.

==== Subcastes ====
The Kashmiri Pandits are divided into three subcastes: Guru/Bāchabat (priests), Jotish (astrologers), and Kārkun (who were historically mainly employed by the government). All three subcastes interdine and interteach, but only the Jotish and Kārkun subcastes intermarry.

===Krams===
Kashmiri Hindus are Saraswat Brahmins and are known by the exonym &quot;Pandit&quot;. Kashmiri Hindus society reckons descent patrilineally. Certain property and titles may be inherited through the male line, but certain inheritances may accrue through the female line.

<text>Virtual Studio Technology (VST) is an audio plug-in software interface that integrates software synthesizers and effects units into digital audio workstations. VST and similar technologies use digital signal processing to simulate traditional recording studio hardware in software. Thousands of plugins exist, both commercial and freeware, and many audio applications support VST under license from its creator, Steinberg.

== Overview ==
VST plugins generally run within a digital audio workstation (DAW), to provide additional functionality, though a few standalone plugin hosts exist that support VST. Most VST plugins are either instruments (VSTi) or effects (VSTfx), although other categories exist—for example spectrum analyzers and various meters. VST plugins usually provide a custom graphical user interface that displays controls similar to physical switches and knobs on audio hardware. Some (often older) plugins rely on the host application for their user interface.

VST instruments include software simulation emulations of well-known hardware synthesizers and samplers. These typically emulate the look of the original equipment as well as its sonic characteristics. This lets musicians and recording engineers use virtual versions of devices that otherwise might be difficult and expensive to obtain.

VST instruments receive notes as digital information via MIDI, and output digital audio. Effect plugins receive digital audio and process it through to their outputs. (Some effect plugins also accept MIDI input—for example, MIDI sync to modulate the effect in sync with the tempo). MIDI messages can control both instrument and effect plugin parameters. Most host applications can route the audio output from one VST to the audio input of another VST (&quot;chaining&quot;). For example, the output of a VST synthesizer can be sent through a VST reverb effect.

== History ==
Steinberg released the VST interface specification and SDK in 1996. They released it at the same time as Steinberg Cubase 3.02, which included the first VST format plugins: Espacial (a reverb), Choirus (a chorus effect), Stereo Echo, and Auto-Panner.

Steinberg updated the VST interface specification to version 2.0 in 1999. One addition was the ability for plugins to receive MIDI data. This supported the introduction of &quot;Virtual Studio Technology Instrument (VSTi)&quot; format plugins. VST Instruments can act as standalone software synthesizers, samplers, or drum machines.

Neon was the first available VST Instrument (included with Cubase VST 3.7). It was a 16-voice, 2-oscillator virtual analog synthesizer.

In 2006, the VST interface specification was updated to version 2.4. Changes included the ability to process audio with 64-bit precision. A free-software replacement was developed for LMMS that would be used later by other free-software projects.

VST 3.0 came out in 2008. Changes included:
* Audio Inputs for VST Instruments
* Multiple MIDI inputs/outputs
* Optional SKI (Steinberg Kernel Interface) integration

VST 3.5 came out in February 2011. Changes included &quot;note expression&quot;, which provides extensive articulation information in individual note events in a polyphonic arrangement. According to Steinberg, this supports performance flexibility and a more natural playing feel.
In October 2011, Celemony Software and PreSonus released Audio Random Access (ARA), an extension for audio plug-in interfaces, such as VST, allowing greater integration between audio plug-ins and DAW software.

In September, 2013, Steinberg discontinued maintenance of the VST 2 SDK. In December, Steinberg stopped distributing the SDK. The higher versions are continued.

VST 3.6.7 came out in March, 2017. It includes a preview version of VST3 for Linux platform, the VST3 part of the SDK gets a dual license: &quot;Proprietary Steinberg VST3&quot; or the &quot;Open-source GPLv3&quot;.

== VST plugins ==
There are three types of VST plugins:

* VST instruments generate audio. They are generally either virtual synthesizers or virtual samplers. Many recreate the look and sound of famous hardware synthesizers. Better known VST instruments include Discovery, Nexus, Sylenth1, Massive, Omnisphere, FM8, Absynth, Reaktor, Gladiator, Serum and Vanguard.
* VST effects process rather than generate audio—and perform the same functions as hardware audio processors such as reverbs and phasers. Other monitoring effects provide visual feedback of the input signal without processing the audio. Most hosts allow multiple effects to be chained. Audio monitoring devices such as spectrum analyzers and meters represent audio characteristics (frequency distribution, amplitude, etc.) visually.
* VST MIDI effects process MIDI messages (for example, transpose or arpeggiate) and route the MIDI data to other VST instruments or to hardware devices.

== VST hosts ==
A VST host is a software application or hardware device that VST plugins run under. The host application presents the plugin UIs and routes digital audio and MIDI to and from the plugins.

Examples of VST hosts include media players such as JRiver Media Center and foobar2000. 

Stand-alone &quot;dedicated hosts&quot; provide a host environment for VST plugins rather than use the plugins to extend their own capabilities. These are usually optimized for live performance use, with features like fast song configuration switching.

VST plugins can be hosted in incompatible environments using a translation layer, or shim. For example, FL Studio only supports its own internal plugin architecture, but an available native &quot;wrapper&quot; loads VST plugins, among others. FXpansion offers a VST-to-RTAS (Real Time AudioSuite) wrapper that lets VST plugins run in Pro Tools, and a VST-to-Audio Units wrapper lets VST plugins run in Logic Pro.

=== Hardware ===
Hardware VST hosts can load special versions of VST plugins. These units are portable and usable without a computer, though some of them require a computer for editing. Other hardware options include PCI/PCIe cards designed for audio processing, which take over audio processing from the computer&#x27;s CPU and free up RAM.

Some hardware hosts accept VSTs and VSTis, and either run Windows-compatible music applications like Cubase, Live, Pro Tools, Logic etc., or run their own DAW. Other are VST Hosts only and require a separate DAW application. &quot;Origin&quot; from Arturia is a hardware DSP system that houses several VST software synthesizers in one machine, like Jupiter 50/80 from Roland. Using appropriate software, audio data can also be sent over a network, so the main host runs on one computer, and VST plugins on peripheral machines.

== Standard ==
The VST plugin standard is the audio plugin standard created by Steinberg to allow any third-party developers to create VST plugins for use within VST host applications. VST requires separate installations for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The short history of commercial environments for Linux means few developers have targeted this platform.

== Presets ==
VST plugins often have many controls, and therefore need a method of managing presets (sets of control settings).

Steinberg Cubase VST introduced two file formats for storing presets: an FXP file stores a single preset, while an FXB file stores a whole bank of presets. These formats have since been adopted by many other VST hosts, although Cubase itself switched to a new system of preset management with Cubase 4.0.

Many VST plugins have their own method of loading and saving presets, which do not necessarily use the standard FXP/FXB formats.

== Competing technologies ==
*Apple&#x27;s Audio Units
*Digidesign&#x27;s Real Time AudioSuite
*LADSPA, DSSI for Linux
*LV2, a cross-platform, open source, liberally licensed audio plugin standard
*Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX plugin
*Mark of the Unicorn&#x27;s Motu Audio System
*JACK Audio Connection Kit, an open-source sound server allowing flexible audio routing between apps
*CLever Audio Plug-in (CLAP), a MIT-licensed alternative to VST3

== Programming languages ==
Steinberg&#x27;s VST SDK is a set of C++ classes based around an underlying C API. The SDK can be downloaded from their website.

In addition, Steinberg has developed the VST GUI, which is another set of C++ classes, which can be used to build a graphical interface. There are classes for buttons, sliders and displays, etc. Note that these are low-level C++ classes and the look and feel still have to be created by the plugin manufacturer. VST GUI is part of the VST SDK and is also available as a SourceForge project.

There are also several ports to other programming languages available from third parties.

Many commercial and open-source VSTs are written using the Juce C++ framework instead of direct calls to the VST SDK because this allows multi-format (VST, Audio Units and Real Time AudioSuite) binaries to be built from a single codebase.

<doc id="399070" wikidata="Q241111" url="?curid=399070" title="Alexia (singer)">
<text>Alessia Aquilani (born 19 May 1967), known professionally as Alexia, is an Italian singer. Before recording in Italian in the 2000s, she made records in English in the 1990s. Many of those were international hits. Before her solo career, she was the vocalist of Ice MC.

In her career, she has sold over 6 million records with ten top 10 singles, four of which were number-ones with numerous international sales certifications. She has performed at the Festivalbar nine times, and four times at the Sanremo Music Festival in which she has earned, besides several music critic awards, three second-placings, and one first-placing in 2003.

==Career==

===Early work===
Alexia was born in Arcola, Liguria, and from a young age regularly entered singing talent competitions.

She started working for Italian label Euroenergy (by Disco Magic) in 1989 with the singles (Eurobeat/hi-NRG style) &quot;Boy&quot; as Alexia Cooper and &quot;It&#x27;s All Right&quot; as Lita Beck. One year later, she provided backing vocals to the singles &quot;Cinema&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; by Ice MC. Later she worked with producer Roberto Zanetti (better known as Robyx) in 1990, as a back-up singer to several of Zanetti&#x27;s Eurodance acts on his DWA label, including Double You and Ice MC and notably featured on many of the latter&#x27;s biggest hits such as &quot;Think About the Way&quot; (on the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; soundtrack), &quot;It&#x27;s a Rainy Day&quot; and &quot;Russian Roulette&quot;. When Ice MC left DWA, Robyx turned his attention to Alexia, and the pair wrote the song &quot;Me and You&quot;, which included the vocals of Double You. The song was a big international hit and was followed the next year by &quot;Summer Is Crazy&quot; and &quot;Number One&quot;, which again were international hits.

===International success===
In early 1997, recording began on Alexia&#x27;s debut album &quot;Fan Club&quot; with the final international single from the album, &quot;Uh La La La&quot;, preceding it. Unlike her previous singles which were all Eurodance, &quot;Uh La La La&quot; was a slower pop track and would become her breakout hit, becoming a European summer anthem in 1997, hitting the top 10 in many countries.

In early 1998, Alexia officially signed to Sony Music through their subsidiary Dancepool which had released some of Alexia&#x27;s previous singles in certain territories. After this, work began on breaking her in the UK market and a special remix was commissioned. The resulting Almighty Edit propelled the track into the UK top 10 and was also a hit in Australia. Simultaneously in Europe, Alexia released &quot;Gimme Love&quot;, the first single from her second album &quot;The Party&quot;, which saw her begin to branch away from Eurodance towards Europop, causing disappointment amongst some of her fans. Later that year, &quot;The Music I Like&quot; (her first Eurodance single since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Number One&quot;) was released across Europe, followed by &quot;Keep On Movin&#x27;&quot;.

1999 saw the release of her third album &quot;Happy&quot;, along with the singles &quot;Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Happy&quot;, with Alexia switching to the Epic label. The album did not have as much success as her previous albums and her career began to decline outside Italy, with the release of &quot;Goodbye&quot; in the UK being delayed then ultimately cancelled.

===2000–2001===
After five years with Robyx and the DWA team, Alexia released &quot;The Hits&quot;, a compilation of all her international singles, along with new track &quot;Ti amo ti amo&quot;. Shortly after the release, Alexia decided to leave DWA and Robyx as she wanted to expand her sound and audience beyond Eurodance. In November 2000, she duetted with Gianni Morandi on his single &quot;Non ti dimenticherò&quot;.

In 2001, her fourth album, &quot;Mad for Music&quot;, was released and this was the first album she had co-produced. The album and its two singles, &quot;Money Honey&quot; and &quot;Summerlovers&quot;, only saw release in Italy but did not meet with the same success in her home country as her previous music had.

===2002–2007===
In 2002, Alexia abandoned Eurodance and started singing almost exclusively in Italian. She made her first appearance at the Sanremo Music Festival in 2002, coming second with &quot;Dimmi come...&quot;, which was on her fifth album &quot;Alexia&quot;. Two more singles followed, &quot;Non lasciarmi mai&quot; and &quot;Hasta la vista baby&quot;. To satisfy international fans, an English version of the album was released, with &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know&quot; (the English version of &quot;Dimmi come...&quot;) meeting limited success in France and Australia. Following this, Alexia&#x27;s music would be released solely in Italy. The following year, she returned to Sanremo with the song &quot;Per dire di no&quot; and won. The song was from her 2003 album &quot;Il cuore a modo mio&quot;, which also contained the single &quot;Egoista&quot;.

Her most successful Italian album was released in 2004, &quot;Gli occhi grandi della luna&quot;, which featured two singles: &quot;Come tu mi vuoi (You Need Love)&quot; and &quot;Una donna sola&quot;.

In 2005, Alexia released her second greatest hits album spanning her Italian hits, &quot;Da grande&quot;. The lead single from the album, &quot;Da grande&quot;, came second in the women&#x27;s category at the 2005 Sanremo Festival. After a musical break, Alexia returned in 2007 with a new song, and her first digital download single, &quot;Du Du Du&quot;. Following its release, Alexia left Sony Music.

===2008–present===
In 2008, Alexia released her first studio album in four years entitled &quot;Ale&quot; and a new record deal with Edel. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Grande coraggio&quot; and later followed by &quot;Guardarti dentro&quot;. In 2009, Alexia once again participated in the Sanremo Festival singing a duet with Mario Lavezzi titled &quot;Biancaneve&quot;. The song was a big hit in Italy, reaching the top 10 and being Alexia&#x27;s biggest hit for some time. Following this, a re-recorded version of &quot;Ale&quot; was released entitled &quot;Ale &amp; C&quot;, which contained three songs from &quot;Ale&quot; re-recorded as duets, two songs re-recorded in English and two new tracks. &quot;We Is the Power&quot;, a duet with Bloom 06 was released as the second single, followed by &quot;E non sai&quot;.

On June 22, 2010, Alexia released the album &quot;Stars&quot;. Only one single, &quot;Star&quot;, was released on June 11. In July 2012, a new single, &quot;A volte sì a volte no&quot;, was released in Italy. In February 2013, Alexia announced a new version of &quot;Summer Is Crazy&quot; would feature on her upcoming album, &quot;ICanzonissime&quot;.

In 2015, Alexia released a new album, in Italian, entitled &quot;Tu puoi se vuoi&quot;, which spawned three singles: &quot;Il mondo non accetta le parole&quot;, &quot;Sento&quot; and &quot;Prenditi la vita&quot;.

<doc id="399071" wikidata="Q2701386" url="?curid=399071" title="Danny John-Jules">
<text>Daniel John-Jules (born 16 September 1960) is a British actor, singer and dancer. He is best known for playing Cat in the sci-fi comedy series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Barrington in the comic children&#x27;s series &quot;Maid Marian and Her Merry Men&quot;, and policeman Dwayne Myers in the crime drama &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;. He was also a protagonist in the hit CBBC children&#x27;s spy drama &quot;M.I. High&quot;, in which he portrayed Lenny Bicknall, the caretaker.

==Early life==
John-Jules was born in St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington, London, brought up in Notting Hill and attended Rutherford School, Paddington, from 1972 to 1977. There he learnt gymnastics.

Both his parents are from Dominica, and arrived in the UK aboard HMT &quot;Empire Windrush&quot;. His mother worked in the courts; he has a brother who is a barrister.

==Career==
John-Jules has played the role of Cat in the science fiction comedy series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; since its inception in 1988. He also starred in the children&#x27;s spy series &quot;M.I. High&quot; and played Barrington in the children&#x27;s series &quot;Maid Marian and Her Merry Men&quot;. In addition to his acting career, he has made various appearances both as a dancer and a singer.

Before his television and film work, he was a dancer in a group called &#x27;second generation&#x27; and in many productions in West End theatres. He was a member of the original cast of &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, playing a boxcar called Rocky I. In 1993, he released a song from &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, &quot;Tongue Tied&quot;, as a single, which entered the top 20, eventually reaching a high of 17. John-Jules featured his &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; co-stars and backing singers in the video. For this release, he was billed as simply &quot;The Cat&quot;; a CD-EP release was also issued featuring this song along with a version of the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; theme song.

Among other productions, John-Jules was the dancer from the crowd in the Wham! video for &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot;. He gets up partway through the instrumental section and dances alongside George Michael. John-Jules also danced on the Lena Zavaroni TV Series in 1981, and has made a tribute to her on her website.

On television, John-Jules is best known for his portrayal of Cat and Cat&#x27;s geeky alter ego Dwayne Dibbley in the British comedy series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. He got the part of Cat by turning up half an hour late for his audition, dressed in his father&#x27;s old zoot suit. He was unaware that he was late and hence did not appear at all concerned about it. The producers immediately decided he was cool enough to be &quot;the Cat&quot;. Craig Charles said at a &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; convention that John-Jules was a lot like the Cat in that he had a lot of clothes. He said, &quot;Danny John-Jules could change his clothes every four seconds for a year and he still wouldn&#x27;t run out of clothes.&quot; Along with Charles, John-Jules is the only other cast member to appear in every episode of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; to date.
His first acknowledged television and film roles were in Roy Minton&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Scum&quot;, where he played one of the inmates. The TV version, which was part of the &quot;Play for Today&quot; strand, was banned prior to broadcast.

He has also played the parts of Barrington in &quot;Maid Marian and Her Merry Men&quot;, Byron Lucifer in &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; and Milton Wordsworth, the original presenter of &quot;The Story Makers&quot; on CBeebies.

Since 1999, he has had several guest appearances as himself in shows such as &quot;Comedy Connections&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Night Fever&quot;.

Between 2002 and 2004 he played Milton Wordsworth in the CBeebies series &quot;The Story Makers&quot;, an educational children&#x27;s television programme that was broadcast for four series. He appears in every series except series 2.

He has also appeared in at least one episode of CBBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Kerching!&quot;, playing Michael&#x27;s father, Trevor and appeared as Lenny Bicknall in series 1 and 2 of &quot;M.I.High&quot;, also on CBBC. He has also appeared in &quot;The Crouches&quot;.

On 8 November 2009, he made a brief appearance during BBC Two&#x27;s coverage of the 2009 Valencian Moto Grand Prix.

In 2014, he played Nigel Rogers in &quot;The Life of Rock with Brian Pern&quot;. In May 2015, it was announced that he would, again, be returning to &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; for the eleventh and twelfth series.

In 2004, Jules played a character on the SF comedy &quot;Starhyke&quot;, but the series remained in post-production for five years, being shown only privately in 2009, the rights finally being bought by Amazon.com in 2015 and released in 2016.

He appeared in the BBC One series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; as policeman Dwayne Myers from its start until 2018. He returned as a guest star for the Christmas Special in 2021.

It was announced that John-Jules plays the lead as Sir Leigh Teabing in the stage version of hit novel The Da Vinci Code&#x27;s 2022 UK tour.

===Film===
John-Jules&#x27; film career began in 1975 playing Frog in the short film &quot;Seven Green Bottles&quot;, which was produced in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police and warned of the dangers and consequences of juvenile crime. He supplied the voice for two characters in &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986), then appeared in the 1986 version of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998), and &quot;Blade II&quot; (2002). He has also appeared, uncredited, in the 1979 British film &quot;Scum&quot;, playing a look-out during a fight scene.

He has appeared in the 2008 British films &quot;The Grind&quot; and &quot;Sucker Punch&quot;. He has a small role as Rachel Weisz&#x27; manager in the Lincoln, Nebraska police force in the 2010 film &quot;The Whistleblower&quot;.

John-Jules also played one of the dancers in the 1981 movie &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, which, like &quot;Little Shop Of Horrors&quot;, was directed by Frank Oz. He is among the dancers in the restaurant where Kermit and Miss Piggy are dancing.

===Other work===
John-Jules provided his voice for the character of Gex in the UK and European release of &quot;Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko&quot;. For several years in the late 1990s he appeared in the annual Christmas pantomime at Aldershot&#x27;s Princes Hall theatre, playing his &quot;Cat&quot; character. John-Jules has also provided voices for the British Canadian animated series &quot;Chop Socky Chooks&quot; for Cartoon Network, Teletoon and Aardman Animations and the 2015 remake of the British children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;.

John-Jules participated in the 16th series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Amy Dowden. In week 5 he topped the leaderboard with a total of 37 points for his jive. The couple were awarded the first 10 score of the series when Darcey Bussell marked their Jive to &quot;Flip, Flop and Fly&quot; in week 5. The couple were eliminated in Week 8 after losing a dance off to Graeme Swann and Oti Mabuse, their elimination came days after controversial bullying allegations, with tabloids reporting that John-Jules had reduced Dowden to tears.

== Personal life ==
John-Jules is married to Petula Langlais; the couple have two children, both of whom have had minor acting roles alongside their father. He is also an avid motorcyclist and regularly participates in charity rides.

His nephew is former Arsenal and current Crawley Town footballer Tyreece John-Jules.

In November 2008 John-Jules was convicted of assaulting two bin men. He was ordered to perform 120 hours of community service. After the court hearing, John-Jules maintained he had a &quot;clear conscience&quot;, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve been doing community service for over 30 years, this is just another day.&quot;

<text>The Cat, or simply Cat, is a fictional character in the British science fiction sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. He is played by Danny John-Jules. He is a descendant of Dave Lister&#x27;s pregnant pet house cat Frankenstein, whose descendants evolved into a humanoid form over three million years while Lister was in stasis (suspended animation). As a character, he is vain and aloof, and loves to dress in extravagant clothing. He is simply referred to as &quot;Cat&quot; in lieu of a real name.

== Fictional history ==
=== Television ===
==== 1980s ====
The &quot;Cat&quot; first appeared in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;″s first episode &quot;The End&quot; (1988). The computer of the mining ship &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Holly (Norman Lovett), mentions that after a crisis where all of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;″s crew had died in a radiation leak, chicken soup machine repairman Dave Lister&#x27;s (Craig Charles) pregnant cat, along with her unborn kittens, were sealed in the hold while Lister was put into stasis as punishment for keeping an unquarantined cat on board. Lister is left in stasis for three million years until the radiation reaches normal levels. This cat, Frankenstein, is mentioned by the Cat as a story he learnt about at school, describing her as &quot;The holy mother, saved by Cloister the Stupid, who was frozen in time, and who gaveth of his life that we might live ... who shall returneth to lead us to Fuchal, the promised land,&quot; with Lister realising that &quot;Cloister the Stupid&quot; refers to Lister. Holly also mentions that the Cat evolved from the cats who have been breeding in the hold for three million years. After reawakening from stasis, Lister, the only known human being in existence, tells Holly to set a course for Fuchal, which is actually the archipelago of Fiji, where Lister had originally intended to take Frankenstein three million years earlier as part of his five-year plan.

In &quot;Waiting for God&quot; (1988), Holly translates a holy book written by the Cat&#x27;s people for Lister, in which Lister is described as the cats&#x27; god &quot;Cloister&quot;, and that his plan of buying a farm on Fiji and opening up a hot dog and doughnut diner has become their idea of Heaven, with Fiji known to the cat people as &quot;Fuchal&quot;. Holly also tells of thousands of years of holy wars fought by two factions: those who believed the humorous hats at Fuchal should be red and those who believed they should be blue. Ironically, Lister had wanted them to be green. Eventually, the two factions formed a truce and built two great space arks to go and search for Lister and the promised land. One of the two arks, following a set of sacred directions (Lister&#x27;s laundry list, which he lined Frankenstein&#x27;s basket with), promptly crashed into an asteroid. According to a dying cat priest (Noel Coleman), &quot;the sick and the lame&quot; cat people did not go on the arks with the rest of the cats, and were left on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; to die. Two of these cats were the Cat&#x27;s parents, a female &quot;cripple&quot; and a male &quot;idiot&quot; who ate his own feet. Over time, the rest of the cat people died off.

According to Lister in &quot;Me²&quot; (1988), there are no other cats apart from the Cat himself aboard &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

&quot;Parallel Universe&quot; (1988) shows Holly&#x27;s &quot;Holly Hop Drive&quot; trying to get to Earth within a few seconds. Instead, however, it lands the crew in a female-oriented parallel universe with another version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Rather than having a female Cat on board, however, this universe&#x27;s version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; instead has a male humanoid Dog (played by Matthew Devitt). He is depicted as flea-ridden, and having an interest in smelling people&#x27;s behinds and a fear of baths.

In &quot;Timeslides&quot; (1989), the Cat race temporarily ceases to exist after Lister is seen travelling back in time by entering a photographic slide with mutated developing fluid to convince his younger self (played by Emile Charles) to become wealthy and successful and not join the Space Corps. The hologram Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie) unwittingly reverses this new timeline by going back in time to &quot;his&quot; boyhood self (played by Simon Gaffney), causing the Cat race to come back into existence.

==== 1990s ====
The pleasure genetically-engineered lifeform (GELF) Camille appears in the episode &quot;Camille&quot; (1991), and is perceived differently depending on who is looking at her. Camille is seen as whatever the person who is looking at her desires the most, being described by the Cat as what his &quot;perfect mate&quot; is. The way she appears to the Cat is revealed to be a double of the Cat himself (also played by John-Jules).

In &quot;Demons and Angels&quot; (1992), &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; is blown up when the beam of a device called the triplicator is put into reverse, putting the engine core into meltdown, while creating a &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, complete with their own versions of the Cat (both played by John-Jules). Before the lifespans of both versions of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; expire after an hour, the crew collect pieces of the triplicator from both &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;s, and restore the original &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; by amalgamating the two copies with a rebuilt triplicator. The &quot;high&quot; version of the Cat is blown up by a bomb the &quot;lows&quot; throw at him, while the &quot;low&quot; version disappears with his version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

In &quot;Back to Reality&quot; (1992), ink from a &quot;despair squid&quot; causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and mechanoid Kryten (Robert Llewellyn) to share a hallucination, with the hallucinations attacking things they each consider &quot;quintessential to [their] self-esteem&quot;. In the hallucination, the Cat loses his &quot;cool&quot;, and becomes a &quot;no-style gimbo&quot; with a massive overbite and unflattering clothes called Duane Dibley. The four nearly commit suicide together, but a mood stabiliser saves them at the last second.

In &quot;Psirens&quot; (1993), Kryten explains that &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; was &quot;stolen&quot;, with the crew now based inside the shuttlecraft &quot;Starbug&quot; chasing after &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; to recover it.

In &quot;&quot; (1993), an emotion-leeching &quot;emohawk&quot; attacks &quot;Starbug&quot; and consumes the Cat&#x27;s &quot;cool&quot;, turning him into his &quot;Duane Dibley&quot; persona. The emohawk is captured, and Lister freezes it with liquid dilinium. The crew plan to extract the emohawk&#x27;s DNA strands and re-inject the Cat with them to return his emotions to normal, but the Cat clumsily freezes everyone else before this can be done.

In &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1993), Rimmer mentions that all trace of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; has been lost. In the episode, a &quot;Starbug&quot; from fifteen years hence arrives, with Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten&#x27;s future selves intending to copy some components from the present &quot;Starbug&quot;″s time drive so they can fix the fault in their own drive and continue their lives of opulence, socialising with notorious figures of history such as the Habsburgs, the Borgias, Louis XVI, Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring. Lister tells the future crew to leave, and the future &quot;Starbug&quot; fires upon the present day one, apparently killing the crew and blowing &quot;Starbug&quot; up.

In the following episode, &quot;Tikka to Ride&quot; (1997), Lister mentions in a video log that the future &quot;Starbug&quot; destroying the &quot;Starbug&quot; of the present meant the time drive they had used ceased to exist in both the present and the future, or in other words, killing the present crew of &quot;Starbug&quot; in the present also killed the crew in the future, making it impossible for the future crew from ever going back in time to kill themselves in the present. The Cat later mentions in the episode that time returned to the point before the time drive was discovered.

In &quot;Ouroboros&quot; (1997), a Cat from a parallel dimension (played by John-Jules) is briefly seen, when a &quot;linkway&quot; through &quot;non-space&quot; is opened when the membrane between the two realities temporarily collapses.

In &quot;Epideme&quot; (1997), the Cat mentions he brought himself up, and as a result had no formal education. Because there was no one else around, the Cat had to teach himself, and because the Cat barely knew anything to begin with, lessons were &quot;long and slow&quot;, especially on Thursdays when he had &quot;double nothing&quot;. Lister has his right arm amputated in an attempt to rid his body of the Epideme virus (voiced by Gary Martin). Navigation Officer Kristine Kochanski (Chloë Annett) ultimately gets rid of the virus by temporarily stopping Lister&#x27;s heart and containing the virus in deceased &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; crewmember Caroline Carmen&#x27;s (Nicky Leatherbarrow) arm, injected with blood and adrenaline, and tricking the virus into thinking the arm belongs to Kochanski. In the following episode, &quot;Nanarchy&quot; (1997), Kryten tries looking for his self-repairing nanobots to rebuild Lister&#x27;s arm. Returning to the part of space where they were last seen, the crew discovers &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; has been converted by the nanobots into a planetoid made of sand and Holly restored to his old settings and abandoned there, with the &quot;Red Dwarf Starbug&quot; spent years chasing after being a subatomic version shrunken down and eventually exploring Lister&#x27;s laundry basket, and the remaining bits they didn&#x27;t want being left on the planetoid. Kryten orders the nanobots to rebuild Lister&#x27;s arm and turn the planetoid back into &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

In &quot;Back in the Red&quot; (1999), Holly creates a new set of nanobots to bring the entire crew on board &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; back to life after Kryten&#x27;s had gone missing again. Included among the resurrected crew is Rimmer, after the hologrammatic simulation of Rimmer left &quot;Starbug&quot;. Lister, Rimmer, Cat, Kryten and Kochanski are sentenced to two years in the ship&#x27;s brig for misuse of confidential information. In &quot;Cassandra&quot; (1999), the five of them get signed up by Lister to the convict army the Canaries after Holly lies to Lister that they&#x27;re a singing troupe.

In &quot;Only the Good...&quot; (1999), a corrosive micro-organism is shown eating apart &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Rimmer crosses into a &quot;mirror universe&quot; where everything is opposite, and obtains the formula to antidote to the micro-organism from that universe&#x27;s version of the Cat (played by John-Jules), an intelligent professor who does &quot;stupid sciencey brainbox type stuff&quot;. However, upon returning to the normal universe, the paper with the formula on it turns into the micro-organism&#x27;s formula. Not being able to find anyone on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, a vending machine (voiced by Tony Slattery) informs Rimmer that everyone crossed back into the mirror universe. The machine opening the way to the mirror universe is shown to have been destroyed by the micro-organism, leaving Rimmer stranded and the only crew member aboard &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in his universe.

==== 2000s ====
In &quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot; (2009), set nine years later, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; is intact; the human race is apparently &quot;virtually extinct&quot; in the universe apart from Lister again; Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten are the only people on board the ship; and Rimmer is shown to be a hard light hologram and the most senior officer on board again; how these have come about and what happened to the micro-organism is not explained. In this special, a female &quot;despair squid&quot;, whose ink causes joy and elation instead of despair to defend herself, causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination where they believe they are fictional characters from a TV series called &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, and their dimension is &quot;invalid&quot;. This leads them to be shown being pulled into the nearest &quot;valid&quot; reality. They confront the &quot;Creator&quot; of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; (Richard O&#x27;Callaghan) on a version of 21st century Earth who is ready to kill off the characters, and Lister accidentally kills him. The four subconsciously realise that they&#x27;re hallucinating, and they wake up on board &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Kryten and Rimmer speculate that they were able to choose whether or not they wanted to wake up because of the strengthened antibodies of the four from the previous encounter with the despair squid.

==== 2010s ====
In &quot;The Beginning&quot; (2012), the Cat deduces that Rimmer&#x27;s long-dead father (Simon Treves) is continuing to haunt him, preventing Rimmer from coming up with a plan to battle a simulant fleet. The Cat tells Rimmer to let his father go. Rimmer does so by playing his father&#x27;s message, which he is only supposed to do once he becomes an officer. This proves that Rimmer no longer cares what his father has to say, and is free of this &quot;demon&quot; inside of him messing up his head, leading to a successful attack devised by Rimmer which defeats the simulants.

In &quot;Can of Worms&quot; (2016), the Cat becomes the host body of a genetically engineered polymorph&#x27;s eggs after the polymorph disguises herself as a female &quot;Felis sapien&quot; (played by Dominique Moore) and goes on a date with the Cat. The polymorph reaches the end of her life cycle after implanting the eggs, and Lister and the Cat kill the offspring after the Cat gives birth to them. In this episode he inadvertently reveals himself to be a virgin, and insists that being impregnated by the polymorph &quot;still counts&quot;.

In &quot;Cured&quot; (2017), it is revealed that Cat is a psychopath as he has many of the qualities of a psychopath such as narcissism, selfishness, and an inability to understand other people&#x27;s feelings.

In &quot;Skipper&quot; (2017), Rimmer uses a quantum skipper to travel to a universe where Lister is kind and hardworking. Here, Lister got put into stasis because he smuggled a pet rat on board, rather than a pet cat. The rat race did not have a religious war when they evolved, but stayed on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, living on most of its decks.

=== Novels ===
According to the novel &quot;Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers&quot; (1989), the cause of the Cat&#x27;s people&#x27;s civil war was over whether their god was named Cloister or Clister.

== Character ==
The Cat exhibits qualities of vanity, such as in &quot;The End&quot; (1988), where his first words are &quot;How am I looking? I&#x27;m looking nice!&quot;

In early episodes, the Cat exhibits typical feline behaviours such as licking anyone who gives him food, playing with &quot;shiny things&quot; and marking his territory, for which purpose he carries a small spray-can in his pocket. While scent-marking, he repeats, &quot;This is mine, this is mine, and all of this is mine.&quot; He bats his food around when it is served on the table, explaining to his startled shipmates, &quot;that is what cats do with [live] food!&quot;

His extreme self-confidence results in him thinking himself to be irresistible to women. He is originally very self-centred, acting purely without concern when his old mentor the &quot;Cat Priest&quot; dies, giving Kryten an earring that the Cat hates on the day before Kryten&#x27;s automatic self-destruct is scheduled and choosing to finish his lunch rather than carry Lister to the medical bay when he collapses. In the episode &quot;Backwards&quot; (1989), Lister asks the Cat if he cares about anyone but himself, to which the Cat responds, &quot;Hell no! I don&#x27;t even care about you.&quot; This behaviour becomes less prevalent as the series goes on. In the episode &quot;Cured&quot; it is revealed that he is a psychopath because of these characteristics.

By Series IV, the Cat becomes less obsessed with mating, and begins to develop a friendship with Lister and Kryten, although he maintains a strong dislike for Rimmer. As he learns to relate to the crew, he stops licking them and marking his territory, and even begins to show genuine concern for others on several occasions. He becomes a skilled pilot of &quot;Starbug&quot; and develops an ability to &quot;smell&quot; dangerous phenomena, even in space— although he does not grasp scientific terms, describing anomalies as a &quot;swirly thing&quot; in the episode &quot;Legion&quot; (1993), and in the episode &quot;Ouroboros&quot; (1997), when asked by Kryten if something &quot;weird&quot; on &quot;Starbug&quot;″s long-range scan is a &quot;wibbly thing&quot; or a &quot;swirly thing&quot;, the Cat says he would &quot;hate to commit [himself]&quot; at such an early stage.

==Style==
The Cat is obsessed with his own superficial attractiveness and has an enormous and flamboyant wardrobe, which he couples with an obsession with his reflection and a penchant for preening. He has been described as &quot;a vain, preening fashion plate who resembles James Brown with fangs&quot;, and Danny John-Jules has described the character of Cat as based on a combination of Little Richard&#x27;s look, James Brown&#x27;s moves and Richard Pryor&#x27;s facial expressions. When auditioning for the show John-Jules attended the audition in character, wearing his father&#x27;s wedding suit, which he described as a &quot;zoot suit&quot;. In order to understand the role, John-Jules studied the 1986 book &quot;Catwatching&quot; by Desmond Morris, learning, among other things, not to blink while in character.

In the first episode the Cat is introduced wearing a pink suit, which Danny John-Jules described as feeling &quot;like an old Cab Calloway suit&quot;. Concerning his character, Danny John-Jules has said &quot;He&#x27;s probably like a little girl the first time she puts on makeup and says &#x27;Hey this stuff looks good...&#x27;.&quot;

During the first two series, the Cat typically dressed in various 1940s-era suits (often gray or pink, with big shoulders and pocket handkerchiefs). He would also wear Cuban-heeled shoes with most of his outfits. He would also wear suits with tailed jackets and ruffled shirts (most notably cream-coloured or reddish-pink). Over the next three seasons, the Cat began wearing flashier outfits (like a tartan three-piece suit) and more leather and vinyl outfits (with boots). He also began wearing brightly coloured hats and coats, such as his zebra-print coat (later revamped to yellow and black). He began sporting more jewellery and earrings.

Starting with series 6 and on through 7, The Cat&#x27;s wardrobe was drastically simplified (John-Jules jokingly speculated that this was done as a cost-saving measure). He wore a black pvc jumpsuit (often with gloves) with a limited number of coats or suits worn over it. Ironically, he spent most of series 8 either in his prison jumpsuit or his battle fatigues.

==In other media==
In the episode &quot;Parallel Universe&quot;, the Cat performs the song &quot;Tongue Tied&quot;, which appears as a dream sequence on a &quot;dream monitor&quot;. The song was later released as a single and reached number 17 in October 1993 in the UK Singles Chart. The artist was listed simply as &quot;The Cat&quot;.

==US pilot==
In the first and second pilot episodes of an American version of the television series, the Cat was played by Hinton Battle and Terry Farrell respectively. (Farrell&#x27;s version was more outwardly catlike in appearance.)

<text>44 (forty-four) is the natural number following 43 and preceding 45.

== In mathematics ==

Forty-four is a repdigit and palindromic number in decimal. It is the tenth 10-happy number, and the fourth octahedral number.

It is a square-prime of the form &quot;p&quot;2 × &quot;q&quot;, and fourth of this form and of the form 22 × &quot;q&quot;, where &quot;q&quot; is a higher prime.

It is the first member of the first cluster of two square-primes; of the form &quot;p&quot;2 × &quot;q&quot;, specifically 22 × 11 = 44 and 32 × 5 = 45. The next such cluster of two square-primes comprises 22 × 29 = 116, and 32 × 13 = 117.

44 has an aliquot sum of 40, within an aliquot sequence of three composite numbers (44, 40, 50, 43, 1, 0) rooted in the prime 43-aliquot tree.

Since the greatest prime factor of 442 + 1 = 1937 is 149 and thus more than 44 twice, 44 is a Størmer number. Given Euler&#x27;s totient function, φ(44) = 20 and φ(69) = 44.

44 is a tribonacci number, preceded by 7, 13, and 24, whose sum it equals.

44 is the number of derangements of 5 items.

There are only 44 kinds of Schwarz triangles, aside from the infinite dihedral family of triangles (&quot;p&quot; 2 2) with &quot;p&quot; = {2, 3, 4, ...}. 

There are 44 distinct stellations of the truncated cube and truncated octahedron, per Miller&#x27;s rules.

44 four-dimensional crystallographic point groups of a total 227 contain dual enantiomorphs, or mirror images.

There are forty-four classes of finite simple groups that arise from four general families of such groups:
* Two general groups stem from cyclic groups and alternating groups.
* Sixteen families of groups stem from simple groups of Lie type.
* Twenty-six groups are sporadic.

Sometimes the Tits group is considered a 17th non-strict simple group of Lie type, or a 27th sporadic group, which would yield a total of 45 classes of finite simple groups.

== In other fields ==
Forty-four is:
* Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot; features Satan&#x27;s supposed nephew, whose alternate name in parallel works is &quot;44&quot;. 
* A song by The Residents. In &quot;44&quot;, included in The Resident&#x27;s &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot; album, the number 44 is a main focus.

<text>Sir David Paradine Frost (7 April 1939 – 31 August 2013) was an English television host, journalist, comedian and writer. He rose to prominence during the satire boom in the United Kingdom when he was chosen to host the satirical programme &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; in 1962. His success on this show led to work as a host on American television. He became known for his television interviews with senior political figures, among them the Nixon interviews with US president Richard Nixon in 1977 which were adapted into a stage play and film. Frost interviewed all eight British prime ministers serving from 1964 to 2016, from Alec Douglas-Home to David Cameron, and all seven American presidents in office from 1969 to 2008.

Frost was one of the people behind the launch of ITV station TV-am in 1983. He was the inaugural host of the US news magazine programme &quot;Inside Edition&quot;. He hosted the Sunday morning interview programme &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot; for the BBC from 1993 to 2005, and spent two decades as host of &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;. From 2006 to 2012, he hosted the weekly programme &quot;Frost Over the World&quot; on Al Jazeera English, and the weekly programme &quot;The Frost Interview&quot; from 2012. He received the BAFTA Fellowship from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2005 and the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Emmy Awards in 2009.

Frost died on 31 August 2013, aged 74, on board the cruise ship , where he had been engaged as a speaker. His memorial stone was unveiled in Poets&#x27; Corner of Westminster Abbey in March 2014.

== Early life and education ==
David Paradine Frost was born in Tenterden, Kent, on 7 April 1939, the son of a Methodist minister of Huguenot descent, the Rev. Wilfred John Paradine Frost (1900–1967), and his wife, Maude Evelyn (&quot;Mona&quot;; 1903–1991), née Aldrich; he had two elder sisters. The name &quot;Paradine&quot; reflected Huguenot ancestry.

While living in Gillingham, Kent, he was taught in the Bible class of the Sunday school at his father&#x27;s church (Byron Road Methodist) by David Gilmore Harvey, and subsequently started training as a Methodist local preacher, which he did not complete.

Frost attended Barnsole Road Primary School in Gillingham, St Hugh&#x27;s School, Woodhall Spa, Gillingham Grammar School and finally – while residing in Raunds, Northamptonshire – Wellingborough Grammar School. Throughout his school years he was an avid football and cricket player, and was offered a contract with Nottingham Forest F.C. For two years before going to university he was a lay preacher, following his witnessing of an event presided over by Christian evangelist Billy Graham.

Frost studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, from 1958, graduating with a Third in English. He was editor of both the university&#x27;s student paper, &quot;Varsity&quot;, and the literary magazine &quot;Granta&quot;. He was also secretary of the Footlights Drama Society, which included actors such as Peter Cook and John Bird. During this period Frost appeared on television for the first time in an edition of Anglia Television&#x27;s &quot;Town And Gown&quot;, performing several comic characters. &quot;The first time I stepped into a television studio&quot;, he once remembered, &quot;it felt like home. It didn&#x27;t scare me. Talking to the camera seemed the most natural thing in the world.&quot;

According to some accounts, Frost was the victim of snobbery from the group with which he associated at Cambridge, which has been confirmed by Barry Humphries. Christopher Booker, while asserting that Frost&#x27;s one defining characteristic was ambition, commented that he was impossible to dislike. According to satirist John Wells, Old Etonian actor Jonathan Cecil congratulated Frost around this time for &quot;that wonderfully silly voice&quot; he used while performing, but then discovered that it was Frost&#x27;s real voice.

After leaving university, Frost became a trainee at Associated-Rediffusion. Meanwhile, having already gained an agent, Frost performed in cabaret at the Blue Angel nightclub in Berkeley Square, London during the evenings.

== Career ==
=== 1962–1963: &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; ===
Frost was chosen by writer and producer Ned Sherrin to host the satirical programme &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, or &quot;TW3&quot;, after Frost&#x27;s flatmate John Bird suggested Sherrin should see his act at The Blue Angel. The series, which ran for less than 18 months during 1962–63, was part of the satire boom in early 1960s Britain and became a popular programme. The involvement of Frost in &quot;TW3&quot; led to an intensification of the rivalry with Peter Cook who accused him of stealing material and dubbed Frost &quot;the bubonic plagiarist&quot;. The new satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; also mocked him at this time. Frost visited the U.S. during the break between the two series of &quot;TW3&quot; in the summer of 1963 and stayed with the producer of the New York City production of &quot;Beyond The Fringe&quot;. Frost was unable to swim, but still jumped into the pool, and nearly drowned until he was saved by Peter Cook. At the memorial service for Cook in 1995, Alan Bennett recalled that rescuing Frost was the one regret Cook frequently expressed.

For the first three editions of the second series in 1963, the BBC attempted to limit the team by scheduling repeats of &quot;The Third Man&quot; television series after the programme, thus preventing overruns. Frost took to reading synopses of the episodes at the end of the programme as a means of sabotage. After the BBC&#x27;s Director General Hugh Greene instructed that the repeats should be abandoned, &quot;TW3&quot; returned to being open-ended. More sombrely, on 23 November 1963, a tribute to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy, an event which had occurred the previous day, formed an entire edition of &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;. An American version of &quot;TW3&quot; ran after the original British series had ended. Following a pilot episode on 10 November 1963, the 30-minute US series, also featuring Frost, ran on NBC from 10 January 1964 to May 1965. In 1985, Frost produced and hosted a television special in the same format, &quot;That Was the Year That Was&quot;, on NBC.

=== 1964–1969: Breakthrough after &quot;TW3&quot; ===
Frost fronted various programmes following the success of &quot;TW3&quot;, including its immediate successor, &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot;, which he co-chaired with Willie Rushton and poet P. J. Kavanagh. Screened on three evenings each week, this series was dropped after a sketch was found to be offensive to Catholics and another to the British royal family. More successful was &quot;The Frost Report&quot;, broadcast between 1966 and 1967. The show launched the television careers of John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, and Ronnie Corbett, who appeared together in the Class sketch. Frost signed for Rediffusion, the ITV weekday contractor in London, to produce a &quot;heavier&quot; interview-based show called &quot;The Frost Programme&quot;. Guests included Oswald Mosley and Rhodesian premier Ian Smith. His memorable dressing-down of insurance fraudster Emil Savundra, regarded as the first example of &quot;trial by television&quot; in the UK, led to concern from ITV executives that it might affect Savundra&#x27;s right to a fair trial. Frost&#x27;s introductory words for his television programmes during this period, &quot;Hello, good evening and welcome&quot;, became his catchphrase and were often mimicked.

Frost was a member of a successful consortium, including former executives from the BBC, that bid for an ITV franchise in 1967. This became London Weekend Television, which began broadcasting in July 1968. The station began with a programming policy that was considered &quot;highbrow&quot; and suffered launch problems with low audience ratings and financial problems. A September 1968 meeting of the Network Programme Committee, which made decisions about the channel&#x27;s scheduling, was particularly fraught, with Lew Grade expressing hatred of Frost in his presence. Frost, according to Kitty Muggeridge in 1967, had &quot;risen without a trace.&quot;

He was involved in the station&#x27;s early years as a presenter. On 20 and 21 July 1969, during the British television Apollo 11 coverage, he presented &quot;David Frost&#x27;s Moon Party&quot; for LWT, a ten-hour discussion and entertainment marathon from LWT&#x27;s Wembley Studios, on the night Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon. Two of his guests on this programme were British historian A. J. P. Taylor and entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. Around this time Frost interviewed Rupert Murdoch whose recently acquired Sunday newspaper, the &quot;News of the World&quot;, had just serialised the memoirs of Christine Keeler, a central figure in the Profumo scandal of 1963. For the Australian publisher, this was a bruising encounter, although Frost said that he had not intended it to be. Murdoch confessed to his biographer Michael Wolff that the incident had convinced him that Frost was &quot;an arrogant bastard, [and] a bloody bugger&quot;.

In the late 1960s Frost began an intermittent involvement in the film industry. Setting up David Paradine Ltd in 1966, he part-financed &quot;The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer&quot; (1970), in which the lead character was based partly on Frost, and gained an executive producer credit. In 1976, Frost was the executive producer of the British musical film &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot;, retelling the story of Cinderella. Frost was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in January 1972 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at London&#x27;s Quaglino&#x27;s restaurant.

=== 1968–1980: American career ===

In 1968, he signed a contract worth £125,000 to appear on American television in his own show on three evenings each week, the largest such arrangement for a British television personality at the time. From 1969 to 1972, Frost kept his London shows and fronted &quot;The David Frost Show&quot; on the Group W (U.S. Westinghouse Corporation) television stations in the U.S. His 1970 TV special, &quot;Frost on America&quot;, featured guests such as Jack Benny and Tennessee Williams.

In a declassified transcript of a 1972 telephone call between Frost and Henry Kissinger, President Nixon&#x27;s national security advisor and secretary of state, Frost urged Kissinger to call chess Grandmaster Bobby Fischer and urge him to compete in that year&#x27;s World Chess Championship. During this call, Frost revealed that he was working on a novel. Frost interviewed heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali in 1974 at his training camp in Deer Lake, Pennsylvania before &quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot; with George Foreman. Ali remarked, &quot;Listen David, when I meet this man, if you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait till I whip Foreman&#x27;s behind.&quot;

In 1977, the Nixon interviews, which were five 90-minute interviews with former U.S. President Richard Nixon, were broadcast. Nixon was paid $600,000 plus a share of the profits for the interviews, which had to be funded by Frost himself after the U.S. television networks turned down the programme, describing it as &quot;checkbook journalism&quot;. Frost&#x27;s company negotiated its own deals to syndicate the interviews in the U.S. via the Mutual Broadcasting System and their local affiliates, as well as internationally. Frost taped around 29 hours of interviews with Nixon over four weeks. Nixon, who had previously avoided discussing his role in the Watergate scandal that had led to his resignation as president in 1974, expressed contrition saying, &quot;I let the American people down and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life&quot;. Frost asked Nixon whether the president could do something illegal in certain situations such as against antiwar groups and others if he decides &quot;it&#x27;s in the best interests of the nation or something&quot;. Nixon replied: &quot;Well, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal&quot;, by definition.

Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Frost was the last person to interview Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the deposed Shah of Iran. The interview took place on Contadora Island in Panama in January 1980, and was broadcast by the American Broadcasting Company in the U.S. on 17 January. The Shah talks about his wealth, his illness, the SAVAK, the torture during his reign, Khomeini, his threat of extradition to Iran and draws a summary of the current situation in Iran. Frost was an organiser of the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly in 1979. Ten years later, he was hired as the anchor of new American tabloid news program &quot;Inside Edition&quot;. He was dismissed after only three weeks because of poor ratings. It seems he was &quot;considered too high-brow for the show&#x27;s low-brow format.&quot;

=== 1980–2010: &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot; and later work ===

Frost was one of the &quot;Famous Five&quot; who launched TV-am in February 1983; however, like LWT in the late 1960s, the station began with an unsustainable &quot;highbrow&quot; approach. Frost remained a presenter after restructuring. &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot; began in September 1983 and continued until the station lost its franchise at the end of 1992. Frost had been part of an unsuccessful consortium, CPV-TV, with Richard Branson and other interests, which had attempted to acquire three ITV contractor franchises prior to the changes made by the Independent Television Commission in 1991. After transferring from ITV, his Sunday morning interview programme &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot; ran on the BBC from January 1993 until 29 May 2005. For a time it ran on BSB before moving to BBC 1.

Frost hosted &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;, which ran on several UK channels from 1987 until 2008 and also featured Loyd Grossman. Produced by his own production company, the programme was first shown in prime time and on daytime television in its later years. Frost worked for Al Jazeera English, presenting a live weekly hour-long current affairs programme, &quot;Frost Over The World&quot;, which started when the network launched in November 2006. The programme regularly made headlines with interviewees such as Tony Blair, President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. The programme was produced by the former &quot;Question Time&quot; editor and &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; journalist Charlie Courtauld. Frost was one of the first to interview the man who authored the Fatwa on Terrorism, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri.

During his career as a broadcaster, Frost became one of Concorde&#x27;s most frequent fliers, having flown between London and New York an average of 20 times per year for 20 years. In 2007, Frost hosted a discussion with Libya&#x27;s leader Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Monitor Group&#x27;s involvement in the country. In June 2010, Frost presented &quot;Frost on Satire&quot;, an hour-long BBC Four documentary looking at the history of television satire.

==&quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;==
&quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; was originally a play written by Peter Morgan, developed from the interviews that Frost had conducted with Richard Nixon in 1977. &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; was presented as a stage production in London in 2006 and on Broadway in 2007. Frank Langella won a Leading Actor Tony Award for his portrayal of Nixon; the play also received nominations for Best Play and Best Direction.

The play was adapted into a Hollywood motion picture entitled &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; and starring Michael Sheen as Frost and Langella as Nixon, both reprising their stage roles. The film was released in 2008 and directed by Ron Howard. It was nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, winning none: Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Director-Drama, Best Actor-Drama (Langella), Best Screenplay, and Best Original Score. It was also nominated for five Academy Awards, again winning none: Best Picture, Best Actor (Langella), Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.

In February 2009, Frost was featured on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s international affairs programme &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; in a report titled &quot;The World According To Frost&quot;, reflecting on his long career and portrayal in the film &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;.

==Personal life==

Frost had several relationships with high-profile women. In the mid-1960s, he dated British actress Janette Scott, between her marriages to songwriter Jackie Rae and singer Mel Tormé; from 1970 to 1973, he was engaged to American actress Diahann Carroll; in 1974, he was briefly engaged to American model Karen Graham; between 1972 and 1977 he had a relationship with British socialite Caroline Cushing; in 1981, he married Lynne Frederick, widow of Peter Sellers, but they divorced the following year. He also had an 18-year intermittent affair with American actress Carol Lynley.

On 19 March 1983, Frost married Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard, daughter of the 17th Duke of Norfolk. Three sons were born to the couple over the next five years. His second son, Wilfred Frost, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and currently works as an anchor at Sky News and CNBC. They lived for many years in Chelsea, London, and kept a weekend home at Michelmersh Court in Hampshire.

==Death and tributes ==
On 31 August 2013, Frost was aboard the Cunard cruise ship when he died of a heart attack, aged 74.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc obit&quot;/ Cunard said that the vessel had left Southampton for a ten-day cruise in the Mediterranean, ending in Rome. A post-mortem found that Frost had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Frost&#x27;s son Miles died from the same condition at the age of 31 in 2015.

A funeral service was held at Holy Trinity Church in Nuffield, Oxfordshire, on 12 September 2013, after which he was interred in the church&#x27;s graveyard. On 13 March 2014, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey, at which Frost was honoured with a memorial stone in Poets&#x27; Corner.

British Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute, saying: &quot;He could be—and certainly was with me—both a friend and a fearsome interviewer.&quot; Michael Grade commented: &quot;He was kind of a television renaissance man. He could put his hand to anything. He could turn over Richard Nixon or he could win the comedy prize at the Montreux Golden Rose festival.&quot;

==Achievements==

Frost was the only person to have interviewed all eight British prime ministers serving between 1964 and 2016 (Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron) and all seven U.S. presidents in office between 1969 and 2009 (Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush).

He was a patron and former vice-president of the Motor Neurone Disease Association charity, as well as being a patron of the Alzheimer&#x27;s Research Trust, Hearing Star Benevolent Fund, East Anglia&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospices, the Home Farm Trust and the Elton John AIDS Foundation. He was also recognised for his contributions to the women&#x27;s charity &quot;Wellbeing for Women&quot;.

After having been in television for 40 years, Frost was estimated to be worth £200 million by the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; in 2006, a figure he considered a significant overestimate in 2011. The valuation included the assets of his main British company and subsidiaries, plus homes in London and the country.

<doc id="399080" wikidata="Q1149559" url="?curid=399080" title="Cui-ui">
<text>The cui-ui (Chasmistes cujus) is a large sucker fish endemic to Pyramid Lake and, prior to its desiccation in the 20th century, Winnemucca Lake in northwestern Nevada. It feeds primarily on zooplankton and possibly on nanoplankton (such as algae and diatoms). The maximum size of male cui-ui is approximately and , while females reach approximately and . A cui-ui typically lives for 40 years but does not reach sexual maturity until at least age eight. The cui-ui is an endangered species, and one of the few surviving members of its genus.

The cui-ui population is generally improving in numbers, having attained an estimated population exceeding one million in 1993, thanks to the efforts of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in analysis of the Truckee River spawning grounds and of the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection and EPA in following up on protection measures. The reason the cui-ui remains endangered (though upgraded from critically endangered in 2014) is the recent history of recruitment variation, illustrating that in many years of the 1970s and 1980s there was virtually no recruitment whatsoever due to unsuccessful spawning in an unfavorable water quality and water flow environment of the Truckee River. The species&#x27; outlook is uncertain since a recovery plan based on an enhanced understanding of Pyramid Lake and Truckee River water quality has been published and U.S. Congress adopted a protection plan.

==Pyramid Lake water quality==

Pyramid Lake, the second largest natural lake in the western U.S. prior to construction of the Derby Dam, has been the focus of several water quality investigations, the most detailed starting in the mid-1980s. Under direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a comprehensive dynamic hydrology transport model was developed by Earth Metrics Inc.; the model&#x27;s name was subsequently changed to DSSAM, and it was applied to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and wastewater management decisions throughout the Truckee River Basin. Analytes addressed included nitrogen, reactive phosphate, dissolved oxygen, and ten other parameters. Based upon use of the model, some decisions have been influenced to enhance Pyramid Lake water quality and aid the viability of Pyramid Lake biota, including the cui-ui. The dynamic river model was particularly useful for analyzing Truckee River temperature variations, since the cui-ui often swim upstream to spawn, and their fry are vulnerable to elevations in river temperature.

==Spawning behavior==
The cui-ui is potamodromous, and will attempt to ascend the Truckee River to spawn in mid-April. If inflow is insufficient to permit this, the cui-ui may attempt to spawn in Pyramid Lake, but generally with little success due to the salinity of that lake. Water releases from the Boca reservoir and Stampede reservoirs were () timed to assist the spawning run, although in drought years this water is reserved for the Reno metropolitan area. These releases are critical to successful spawning since low warm flows at the Truckee River delta are inhospitable to upstream migration of adults.

The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of the Pyramid Lake Reservation maintain three hatcheries to ensure the long term viability of the cui-ui. These measures have greatly increased cui-ui populations, although it is still listed as an endangered species.

== Cultural history ==

The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe are the Cui-ui Ticutta, also spelled &quot;Kuyuidikado&quot;, which translated to &quot;cui-ui eaters.&quot; Together with the Lahontan cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi&quot;) the cui-ui was an important food supply for the Cui-ui Tikutta and neighboring Paiute bands who traveled to Pyramid Lake to share in the harvest during the spring spawning runs.

Subsequent to European American settlement of western Nevada in the 1860s many Cui-ui Ticutta made a living by selling fish, although the European Americans generally preferred trout to cui-ui. Cui-ui were also still important for subsistence, despite Bureau of Indian Affairs attempts to encourage farming and discourage fishing.

After the 1905 construction of Derby Dam which diverted much of the Truckee River&#x27;s flow, the Pyramid Lake fishery declined. By 1930, it no longer supplied even subsistence food. Although conditions have improved recently, the cui-ui are managed for cultural and ecological purposes, not as a human food source.

<text>Brainstorming is a creativity technique in which a group of people interact to suggest ideas spontaneously in response to a prompt. Stress is typically placed on the volume and variety of ideas, including ideas that may seem outlandish or &quot;off-the-wall&quot;. Ideas are noted down during the activity, but not assessed or critiqued until later. The absence of criticism and assessment is intended to avoid inhibiting participants in their idea production. The term was popularized by advertising executive Alex Faickney Osborn in the classic work &quot;Applied Imagination&quot; (1953). 

==History==
In 1939, advertising executive Alex F. Osborn began developing methods for creative problem-solving. He was frustrated by employees&#x27; inability to develop creative ideas individually for ad campaigns. In response, he began hosting group-thinking sessions and discovered a significant improvement in the quality and quantity of ideas produced by employees. He first termed the process as &quot;organized ideation&quot;, but participants later came up with the term &quot;brainstorm sessions&quot;, taking the concept after the use of &quot;the brain to storm a problem&quot;.

During the period when Osborn made his concept, he started writing on creative thinking, and the first notable book where he mentioned the term brainstorming was &quot;How to Think Up&quot; (1942).

Osborn outlined his method in the subsequent book &quot;Your Creative Power&quot; (1948), in chapter 33, &quot;How to Organize a Squad to Create Ideas&quot;.

One of Osborn&#x27;s key recommendations was for all the members of the brainstorming group to be provided with a clear statement of the problem to be addressed prior to the actual brainstorming session. He also explained that the guiding principle is that the problem should be simple and narrowed down to a single target. Here, brainstorming is not believed to be effective in complex problems because of a change in opinion over the desirability of restructuring such problems. While the process can address the problems in such a situation, tackling all of them may not be feasible.

==Osborn&#x27;s method==
===Two principles===
Osborn said that two principles contribute to &quot;ideative efficacy&quot;:
# Defer judgment; 
# Reach for quantity.

===Four rules===
Following these two principles were his four general rules of brainstorming, established with intention to:
* reduce social inhibitions among group members;
* stimulate idea generation;
* increase overall creativity of the group.

These four rules were:

# &quot;Go for quantity&quot;: This rule is a way of enhancing divergent production, aiming at facilitation of problem solution through the maxim &quot;quantity breeds quality&quot;. The assumption is that the greater the number of ideas generated the bigger the chance of producing a radical and effective solution.
# &quot;Withhold criticism&quot;: In brainstorming, criticism of ideas generated should be put &#x27;on hold&#x27;. Instead, participants should focus on extending or adding to ideas, reserving criticism for a later &#x27;critical stage&#x27; of the process. By suspending judgment, participants will feel free to generate unusual ideas.
# &quot;Welcome wild ideas&quot;: To get a good long list of suggestions, wild ideas are encouraged. They can be generated by looking from new perspectives and suspending assumptions. These new ways of thinking might give better solutions.
# &quot;Combine and improve ideas&quot;: As suggested by the slogan &quot;1+1=3&quot;. It is believed to stimulate the building of ideas by a process of association.

===Applications===
Osborn said brainstorming should address a specific question; he held that sessions addressing multiple questions were inefficient.

Further, the problem must require the generation of ideas rather than judgment; he uses examples such as generating possible names for a product as proper brainstorming material, whereas analytical judgments such as whether or not to marry do not have any need for brainstorming.

===Groups===
Osborn envisioned groups of around 12 participants, including both experts and novices. Participants are encouraged to provide wild and unexpected answers. Ideas receive no criticism or discussion. The group simply provide ideas that might lead to a solution and apply no analytical judgment as to the feasibility. The judgments are reserved for a later date.

==Variations==

===Nominal group technique===

Participants are asked to write their ideas anonymously. Then the facilitator collects the ideas and the group votes on each idea. The vote can be as simple as a show of hands in favor of a given idea. This process is called distillation.

After distillation, the top-ranked ideas may be sent back to the group or to subgroups for further brainstorming. For example, one group may work on the color required in a product. Another group may work on the size, and so forth. Each group will come back to the whole group for ranking the listed ideas. Sometimes ideas that were previously dropped may be brought forward again once the group has re-evaluated the ideas.

It is important that the facilitator is trained in this process before attempting to facilitate this technique. The group should be primed and encouraged to embrace the process. Like all team efforts, it may take a few practice sessions to train the team in the method before tackling the important ideas.

===Group passing technique===
Each person in a circular group writes down one idea, and then passes the piece of paper to the next person, who adds some thoughts. This continues until everybody gets his or her original piece of paper back. By this time, it is likely that the group will have extensively elaborated on each idea.

The group may also create an &quot;idea book&quot; and post a distribution list or routing slip to the front of the book. On the first page is a description of the problem. The first person to receive the book lists his or her ideas and then routes the book to the next person on the distribution list. The second person can log new ideas or add to the ideas of the previous person. This continues until the distribution list is exhausted. A follow-up &quot;read out&quot; meeting is then held to discuss the ideas logged in the book. This technique takes longer, but it allows individuals time to think deeply about the problem.

===Team idea mapping method===
This method of brainstorming works by the method of association. It may improve collaboration and increase the quantity of ideas, and is designed so that all attendees participate and no ideas are rejected.

The process begins with a well-defined topic. Each participant brainstorms individually, then all the ideas are merged onto one large idea map. During this consolidation phase, participants may discover a common understanding of the issues as they share the meanings behind their ideas. During this sharing, new ideas may arise by the association, and they are added to the map as well. Once all the ideas are captured, the group can prioritize and/or take action.

===Directed brainstorming===
Directed brainstorming is a variation of electronic brainstorming (described below). It can be done manually or with computers. Directed brainstorming works when the solution space (that is, the set of criteria for evaluating a good idea) is known prior to the session. If known, those criteria can be used to constrain the ideation process intentionally.

In directed brainstorming, each participant is given one sheet of paper (or electronic form) and told the brainstorming question. They are asked to produce one response and stop, then all of the papers (or forms) are randomly swapped among the participants. The participants are asked to look at the idea they received and to create a new idea that improves on that idea based on the initial criteria. The forms are then swapped again and respondents are asked to improve upon the ideas, and the process is repeated for three or more rounds.

In the laboratory, directed brainstorming has been found to almost triple the productivity of groups over electronic brainstorming.

===Guided brainstorming===
A guided brainstorming session is time set aside to brainstorm either individually or as a collective group about a particular subject under the constraints of perspective and time. This type of brainstorming removes all cause for conflict and constrains conversations while stimulating critical and creative thinking in an engaging, balanced environment.

Participants are asked to adopt different mindsets for pre-defined period of time while contributing their ideas to a central mind map drawn by a pre-appointed scribe. Having examined a multi-perspective point of view, participants seemingly see the simple solutions that collectively create greater growth. Action is assigned individually.

Following a guided brainstorming session participants emerge with ideas ranked for further brainstorming, research and questions remaining unanswered and a prioritized, assigned, actionable list that leaves everyone with a clear understanding of what needs to happen next and the ability to visualize the combined future focus and greater goals of the group nicely.

===Individual brainstorming===
&quot;Individual brainstorming&quot; is the use of brainstorming in solitary situations. It typically includes such techniques as free writing, free speaking, word association, and drawing a mind map, which is a visual note taking technique in which people diagram their thoughts. Individual brainstorming is a useful method in creative writing and has been shown to be superior to traditional group brainstorming.

===Question brainstorming===
This process involves brainstorming the &quot;questions&quot;, rather than trying to come up with immediate answers and short-term solutions. Theoretically, this technique should not inhibit participation as there is no need to provide solutions. The answers to the questions form the framework for constructing future action plans. Once the list of questions is set, it may be necessary to prioritize them to reach to the best solution in an orderly way.

&quot;Questorming&quot; is another term for this mode of inquiry.

==Methods to improving brainstorming sessions==
Groups can improve the effectiveness and quality of their brainstorming sessions in a number of ways.

* &quot;Avoid face-to-face groups&quot;: Using face-to-face groups can increase production blocking, evaluation apprehension, social matching and social loafing.
* &quot;Stick to the rules&quot;: Brainstorming rules should be followed, and feedback should be given to members that violate these rules. Violations of brainstorming rules tend to lead to mediocre ideas.
* &quot;Pay attention to everyone&#x27;s ideas&quot;: People tend to pay more attention to their own ideas, however brainstorming requires exposure to the ideas of others. A method to encourage members to pay attention to others&#x27; ideas is to make them list the ideas out or ask them to repeat others&#x27; ideas.
* &quot;Include both individual and group approaches&quot;: One method that helps members integrate their ideas into the group is brainwriting. This is where members write their ideas on a piece of paper and then pass it along to others who add their own ideas.
* &quot;Take breaks&quot;: Allow silence during group discussions so that members have time to think things through.
* &quot;Do not rush&quot;: Allow plenty of time for members to complete the task. Although working under pressure tends to lead to more solutions initially, the quality is usually lower than if more time is spent on the task.
* &quot;Stay persistent&quot;: Members should stay focused and persist at the task even when productivity is low.
* &quot;Facilitate the session&quot;: A skilled discussion leader should lead and coordinate the brainstorming sessions. This leader can motivate members, correct mistakes, and provide a clear standard of work. They can also be used to keep track of all the ideas and make sure that these ideas are available to everyone.

==Alternatives to brainstorming==
If brainstorming does not work for a group, some alternatives are available:

* &quot;Buzzgroups&quot;: Larger groups can form subgroups that come up with ideas when the larger group is stumped. Afterwards, these subgroups come back together and discuss their ideas as a whole group.
* &quot;Bug list&quot;: Group members write down all the little problems or irritations concerning the issue they are working on, and then the group discusses solutions for each of these &quot;bugs&quot;.
* &quot;Stepladder technique&quot;: A method where new members state their ideas before listening to the group&#x27;s position.
* &quot;Synectics&quot;: A leader guides the group and discusses their goals, wishes, and frustrations using analogies, metaphors, and fantasy.
* &quot;TRIZ&quot;: This method is primarily used in science and engineering, and involves following a specific sequence of problem analysis, resource review, goal setting, and review of prior approaches to the problem.

==Electronic brainstorming==

Although the brainstorming can take place online through commonly available technologies such as email or interactive web sites, there have also been many efforts to develop customized computer software that can either replace or enhance one or more manual elements of the brainstorming process.

Early efforts, such as GroupSystems at University of Arizona or Software Aided Meeting Management (SAMM) system at the University of Minnesota, took advantage of then-new computer networking technology, which was installed in rooms dedicated to computer supported meetings. When using these electronic meeting systems (EMS, as they came to be called), group members simultaneously and independently entered ideas into a computer terminal. The software collected (or &quot;pools&quot;) the ideas into a list, which could be displayed on a central projection screen (anonymized if desired). Other elements of these EMSs could support additional activities such as categorization of ideas, elimination of duplicates, assessment and discussion of prioritized or controversial ideas. Later EMSs capitalized on advances in computer networking and internet protocols to support asynchronous brainstorming sessions over extended periods of time and in multiple locations.

Introduced along with the EMS by Nunamaker and colleagues at University of Arizona was electronic brainstorming (EBS). By utilizing customized computer software for groups (&quot;group decision support systems&quot; or &quot;groupware&quot;), EBS can replace face-to-face brainstorming. An example of groupware is the &quot;GroupSystems&quot;, a software developed by University of Arizona. After an idea discussion has been posted on &quot;GroupSystems&quot;, it is displayed on each group member&#x27;s computer. As group members simultaneously type their comments on separate computers, those comments are anonymously pooled and made available to all group members for evaluation and further elaboration.

Compared to face-to-face brainstorming, not only does EBS enhanced efficiency by eliminating travelling and turn-taking during group discussions, it also excluded several psychological constraints associated with face-to-face meetings. Identified by Gallupe and colleagues, both production blocking (reduced idea generation due to turn-taking and forgetting ideas in face-to-face brainstorming) and evaluation apprehension (a general concern experienced by individuals for how others in the presence are evaluating them) are reduced in EBS. These positive psychological effects increase with group size. A perceived advantage of EBS is that all ideas can be archived electronically in their original form, and then retrieved later for further thought and discussion. EBS also enables much larger groups to brainstorm on a topic than would normally be productive in a traditional brainstorming session.

Computer supported brainstorming may overcome some of the challenges faced by traditional brainstorming methods. For example, ideas might be &quot;pooled&quot; automatically, so that individuals do not need to wait to take a turn, as in verbal brainstorming. Some software programs show all ideas as they are generated (via chat room or e-mail). The display of ideas may cognitively stimulate brainstormers, as their attention is kept on the flow of ideas being generated without the potential distraction of social cues such as facial expressions and verbal language. EBS techniques have been shown to produce more ideas and help individuals focus their attention on the ideas of others better than a brainwriting technique (participants write individual written notes in silence and then subsequently communicate them with the group). The production of more ideas has been linked to the fact that paying attention to others&#x27; ideas leads to non-redundancy, as brainstormers try to avoid to replicate or repeat another participant&#x27;s comment or idea. Conversely, the production gain associated with EBS was less found in situations where EBS group members focused too much on generating ideas that they ignored ideas expressed by others. The production gain associated with &quot;GroupSystem&quot; users&#x27; attentiveness to ideas expressed by others has been documented by Dugosh and colleagues. EBS group members who were instructed to attend to ideas generated by others outperformed those who were not in terms of creativity.

According to a meta-analysis comparing EBS to face-to-face brainstorming conducted by DeRosa and colleagues, EBS has been found to enhance both the production of non-redundant ideas and the quality of ideas produced. Despite the advantages demonstrated by EBS groups, EBS group members reported less satisfaction with the brainstorming process compared to face-to-face brainstorming group members.

Some web-based brainstorming techniques allow contributors to post their comments anonymously through the use of avatars. This technique also allows users to log on over an extended time period, typically one or two weeks, to allow participants some &quot;soak time&quot; before posting their ideas and feedback. This technique has been used particularly in the field of new product development, but can be applied in any number of areas requiring collection and evaluation of ideas.

Some limitations of EBS include the fact that it can flood people with too many ideas at one time that they have to attend to, and people may also compare their performance to others by analyzing how many ideas each individual produces (social matching).

==Incentives==
Some research indicates that incentives can augment creative processes. Participants were divided into three conditions. In Condition I, a flat fee was paid to all participants. In the Condition II, participants were awarded points for every unique idea of their own, and subjects were paid for the points that they earned. In Condition III, subjects were paid based on the impact that their idea had on the group; this was measured by counting the number of group ideas derived from the specific subject&#x27;s ideas. Condition III outperformed Condition II, and Condition II outperformed Condition I at a statistically significant level for most measures. The results demonstrated that participants were willing to work far longer to achieve unique results in the expectation of compensation. 

==Challenges to effective group brainstorming==
A good deal of research refutes Osborn&#x27;s claim that group brainstorming could generate more ideas than individuals working alone. For example, in a review of 22 studies of group brainstorming, Michael Diehl and Wolfgang Stroebe found that, overwhelmingly, groups brainstorming together produce fewer ideas than individuals working separately. 

Several factors can contribute to a loss of effectiveness in group brainstorming.

* &quot;Production blocking&quot;: Because only one participant may give an idea at any one time, other participants might forget the idea they were going to contribute or not share it because they see it as no longer important or relevant. Further, if we view brainstorming as a cognitive process in which &quot;a participant generates ideas (generation process) and stores them in short-term memory (memorization process) and then eventually extracts some of them from its short-term memory to express them (output process)&quot;, then blocking is an even more critical challenge because it may also inhibit a person&#x27;s train of thought in generating their own ideas and remembering them. Group members can be given notepads to write their ideas on and the meeting can organize who will get to speak next. However, this brainstorming technique does not perform as well as individuals using the nominal group technique. 
* &quot;Collaborative fixation&quot;: Exchanging ideas in a group may reduce the number of domains that a group explores for additional ideas. Members may also conform their ideas to those of other members, decreasing the novelty or variety of ideas, even though the overall number of ideas might not decrease.
* &quot;Evaluation apprehension&quot;: Evaluation apprehension was determined to occur only in instances of personal evaluation. If the assumption of collective assessment were in place, real-time judgment of ideas, ostensibly an induction of evaluation apprehension, failed to induce significant variance. Furthermore, when an authority figure watches the group members brainstorm the effectiveness lowers because members worry their ideas may be viewed negatively. Especially individuals with high social anxiety are particularly unproductive barnstormers and report feeling more nervous, anxious, and worried than group members who are less anxiety prone.
* &quot;Free-writing&quot;: Individuals may feel that their ideas are less valuable when combined with the ideas of the group at large. Indeed, Diehl and Stroebe demonstrated that even when individuals worked alone, they produced fewer ideas if told that their output would be judged in a group with others than if told that their output would be judged individually. However, experimentation revealed free-writing as only a marginal contributor to productivity loss, and type of session (i.e., real vs. nominal group) contributed much more.
* &quot;Personality characteristics&quot;: Extroverts have been shown to outperform introverts in computer mediated groups. Extroverts also generated more unique and diverse ideas than introverts when additional methods were used to stimulate idea generation, such as completing a small related task before brainstorming, or being given a list of the classic rules of brainstorming.
* &quot;Social matching&quot;: One phenomenon of group brainstorming is that participants will tend to alter their rate of productivity to match others in the group. This can lead to participants generating fewer ideas in a group setting than they would individually because they will decrease their own contributions if they perceive themselves to be more productive than the group average. On the other hand, the same phenomenon can also increase an individual&#x27;s rate of production to meet the group average.
* &quot;Illusion of group productivity&quot;: Members tend to overestimate their group&#x27;s productivity and so work less. Members of the group can only guess at the quantity and quality of their group&#x27;s product and their personal contributions to the process but there is no standard to determine how well it is performing. A combination of processes explain why members are incorrectly overestimating productivity:

# Group member(s) may intuitively mistake others&#x27; ideas for their own, and so when they think about their own performance they cognitively claim a few ideas that others actually suggested 
# Group members compare themselves to others who generate relatively few ideas, reassuring them that they are one of the high performers
# Group brainstorming may &quot;feel&quot; more successful because participants rarely experience failure in a communal process. When individuals are trying to think creatively alone, people repeatedly find that they are unable to come up with a new idea. In a group setting, people are less likely to experience this failure in their search for new ideas because others&#x27; ideas are being discussed.

<text>The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization is a book by Peter Senge (a senior lecturer at MIT) focusing on group problem solving using the systems thinking method in order to convert companies into learning organizations that learn to create results that matter as an organization. The five disciplines represent classical approaches (theories and methods) for developing three core and timeless learning capabilities: fostering aspiration, developing reflective conversation, and understanding complexity.

==Content==

===The Five Disciplines===
The five disciplines of what the book refers to as a &quot;learning organization&quot; discussed in the book are:

# &quot;Personal mastery is a discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively.&quot;
# &quot;Mental models are deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures of images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action.&quot;
# &quot;Building shared vision - a practice of unearthing shared pictures of the future that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance.&quot;
# &quot;Team learning starts with &#x27;dialogue&#x27;, the capacity of members of a team to suspend assumptions and enter into genuine &#x27;thinking together&#x27;.&quot;
# &quot;Systems thinking - The Fifth Discipline that integrates the other four.&quot;

Senge describes extensively the role of what he refers to as &quot;mental models,&quot; which he says are integral in order to &quot;focus on the openness needed to unearth shortcomings&quot; in perceptions. The book also focuses on &quot;team learning&quot; with the goal of developing &quot;the skills of groups of people to look for the larger picture beyond individual perspectives.&quot; In addition to these principles, the author stresses the importance of &quot;personal mastery&quot; to foster &quot;the personal motivation to continually learn how [...] actions affect [the] world.&quot;

===The Learning Disabilities===
In addition to &quot;disciplines,&quot; which Senge suggests are beneficial to what he describes as a &quot;learning organization,&quot; Senge also posits several perceived deleterious habits or mindsets, which he refers to as &quot;learning disabilities.&quot;

# &quot;I am my position.&quot;
# &quot;The enemy is out there.&quot;
# The Illusion of Taking Charge
# The Fixation on Events
# The Parable of the Boiling frog
# The Delusion of Learning from Experience
# The Myth of the Management Team

===The 11 Laws of the Fifth Discipline===
# Today&#x27;s problems come from yesterday&#x27;s &quot;solutions.&quot;
# The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.
# Behavior grows better before it grows worse.
# The easy way out usually leads back in.
# The cure can be worse than the disease.
# Faster is slower.
# Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space.
# Small changes can produce big results...but the areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious.
# You can have your cake and eat it too ---but not all at once.
# Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants.
# There is no blame.

===The Architecture of a Learning Organization===
How do we learn to create learning organizations? 

[Extracted from the TFD Fieldbook, pg 15-83. A compelling essay on the conceptual map to guide your own decisions on how to proceed to build Learning Organisations by Dr. Peter Senge] 
How do you know what to do first, second, or third in thinking strategically about building learning organizations? 

At its core, learning organizations build great teams – the trust, the relationships, the acceptance, the synergy, and the results that they achieve. It has a strong ability to learn, adjust and change in response to new realities. It can alter functions and departments when demanded by changes in the work environment or by poor performance. The distinguishing characteristics of a learning organization include a learning culture, a spirit of flexibility and experimentation, people orientation, continuous system-level learning, knowledge generation and sharing, and critical, systemic thinking.

When we look more closely at the development of such teams, we see that people are changed, often profoundly. There is a deep learning cycle. 

Team members develop new skills, and capabilities which alter what they can do and understand. As new capabilities develop, so too do new awareness and sensibilities. Over time, as people start to see and experience the world differently, new beliefs and assumptions begin to form, which enables further development of skills and capabilities. 

This deep learning cycle constitutes the essence of a learning organization – the development not just of new capacities, but of fundamental shifts of mind, individually and collectively. The five basic learning disciplines are the means by which this deep learning cycle is activated. Sustained commitment to the disciplines keeps the cycle going. When this cycle begins to operate, the resulting changes are significant and enduring.

The real work of building learning organizations occurs within a &quot;shell&quot;, an architecture. What makes up the architecture? 

- Guiding Ideas. 
- Theory, methods, and tools. 
- Innovations in infrastructure. 

Without guiding ideas, there is no passion, no overarching sense of direction or purpose. 

Without theory, methods, and tools, people cannot develop the new skills and capabilities required for deep learning. 

Without innovations in infrastructure, inspiring ideas and powerful tools lack credibility because people have neither the opportunity nor resources to pursue their visions or apply the tools. 

Leaders intent on developing learning organizations must focus on all three of the architectural design elements. Without all three, the triangle collapses.

==Reception==
In 1997, &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; identified &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot; as one of the seminal management books of the previous 75 years.

<text>46 (forty-six) is the natural number following 45 and preceding 47.

== In mathematics ==
Forty-six is 
* thirteenth discrete semiprime (formula_1) and the eighth of the form (2.q), where q is a higher prime,
* with an aliquot sum of 26; a semiprime, in an aliquot sequence of six composite numbers (46, 26,16, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1, 0) in the prime 3-aliquot tree,
* a Wedderburn-Etherington number, 
* the second non-trivial enneagonal number, after 24, 
* a centered triangular number,
* the number of parallelogram polyominoes with 6 cells.
* the amount of prime numbers in between 1 and 200.

It is the sum of the totient function for the first twelve integers. 46 is the largest even integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of two abundant numbers. It is also the sixteenth semiprime.

Since it is possible to find sequences of 46+1 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member, 46 is an Erdős–Woods number.

The friendly giant formula_2, the largest of twenty-six sporadic groups, holds a total of forty-six maximal subgroups.

== In sports ==
* The number of mountains in the &quot;46 peaks&quot; of the Adirondack mountain range. People who have climbed all of them are called &quot;forty-sixers&quot;; there is also an unofficial 47th peak.

== In other fields ==

Forty-six is also:
* Because 46 in Japanese can be pronounced as &quot;yon roku&quot;, and &quot;yoroshiku&quot; (よろしく) means &quot;my best regards&quot; in Japanese, people sometimes use 46 for greeting.
* The first Flag of Oklahoma, adopted by the state in 1911, had the number 46 written in blue inside the star, as Oklahoma was the forty-sixth state to join the Union (the United States).

<doc id="399100" wikidata="Q2338941" url="?curid=399100" title="Marty McFly">
<text>Marty McFly is a fictional character and the protagonist of the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise. He is a high school student living in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California, who accidentally becomes a time traveler and alters history after his scientist friend Emmett Brown invents a DeLorean time machine. He was created by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. In the film trilogy, he is portrayed by Canadian actor Michael J. Fox. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; established Fox as a film star, such was the commercial success and popularity of the film upon its release in 1985. Marty returned in two film sequels, &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; in 1990.

During the development of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Eric Stoltz was initially cast in the role, but was replaced by Fox. Various other actors have portrayed or voiced the character in other media. In the animated series, David Kaufman voices him, and in the video game developed and published by Telltale Games, he is voiced by A.J. LoCascio, while Fox makes vocal cameos as his future counterparts. Olly Dobson played him in the original stage musical adaptation in the West End and Casey Likes plays him in the Broadway production.

Critics have described Marty as a film character that defined the 1980s. He was named one of the greatest movie characters of all time by &quot;Empire&quot;. Critics have also described him as a pop culture icon. Since the release of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, he has been influential in other media, often being referenced in television and film.

==Development==

=== Concept and creation ===
The concept for &quot;Back to the Future&quot; originated in co-creators Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wanting to make a film about time travel. Gale said that the story evolved after he found his father&#x27;s old high school year book and asked himself &quot;Would we have been friends if we&#x27;d been at school together?&quot; He considered the realization that parents were once young and also contemplated the idea that people are in charge of their own destinies. Gale and Zemeckis shared a fascination with the way that the future was often depicted in the wrong way in media and thought it would be cool to write a film in which the character changed history.

Gale and Zemeckis started to contemplate the concept while working on &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980). They decided that it was impossible to answer the question of whether they would have hung out with their parents because their perception of them as parents could never change. After outlining the story concept, they spent time filling in the details of the McFly family through history. They used index cards pinned to a bulletin board to define each scene and then worked out the details and dialogue. Part of the process involved defining what a young person in the 1980s would take for granted and they used this as the basis for the jokes, which center on the cultural differences between the eras. This proved challenging as neither of them had grown up in the 1950s or the 1980s.

In the early drafts of the script, Doc Brown&#x27;s technology caused the whole world to change instead of just Marty&#x27;s family but this idea was rejected. Gale stated that Marty was named after a production assistant on &quot;Used Cars&quot; because it seemed like a &quot;good, all-American name&quot;. Zemeckis then suggested the surname McFly. It took some time to work out how Marty would travel in time, but they knew it had to be by accident rather than for some personal gain. In the first two drafts of the script, many elements of the story were different to the final version and featured a time chamber instead of the DeLorean time machine. Marty was characterized as a &quot;streetwise video pirate&quot;, but Zemeckis said that Universal Pictures refused to make a film with a video pirate as the protagonist. Some elements had to be changed or abandoned, such as a joke about Marty&#x27;s long hair, which was removed due to changes in 1980s hairstyles. Zemeckis said that Marty&#x27;s encounter with his teenage mother in 1955 was always the most difficult part of the film and they spent a long time trying to get it right.

When they pitched the story, it was rejected over 40 times as it was considered too sweet, although it was also rejected by Disney due to concerns over the subplot involving Marty&#x27;s relationship with his mother. Others considered that a story about time travel would not make any money. The project was eventually taken on by Steven Spielberg at his production company Amblin Entertainment as he had always believed in the success of the project.

=== Casting and filming ===

Michael J. Fox was the first choice for Zemeckis when casting the role of Marty McFly in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, as he had seen him starring in the television series &quot;Family Ties&quot; in the part of Alex Keaton. Fox was still under contract causing concern about his filming availability, so producer Gary Michael Goldberg did not give him the script. Various young actors auditioned for the part of Marty, including Jon Cryer, Billy Zane, Ben Stiller, C. Thomas Howell, Johnny Depp, John Cusack, Charlie Sheen, Matthew Modine, Ralph Macchio, Peter DeLuise, George Newbern, Robert Downey Jr., Christopher Collet, and Corey Hart (who declined to audition). Ralph Macchio also missed out on the role due to concerns that his New York accent and East Coast ethnicity were not the right fit for Marty&#x27;s &quot;all-American quality&quot;. Eric Stoltz was eventually cast as Marty and used method acting, insisting that the film crew call him &quot;Marty&quot; outside of filming. His intense, serious acting style clashed with the light, comedic portrayal that Zemeckis and Gale were expecting from the part. According to Gale, Stoltz portrayed Marty with the approach that he would feel miserable over how his family changes and this underpinned his performance. After reviewing 40 minutes of footage, Spielberg, Zemeckis and Gale knew it was a problem. Despite making the decision to fire Stoltz, filming continued into January 1985, with Stoltz filming the scene at the Twin Pines mall with Christopher Lloyd. Five weeks into shooting, Zemeckis replaced Stoltz with Fox. By that time, Universal Pictures had already negotiated the filming schedule for Fox around his commitment to &quot;Family Ties&quot;. Zemeckis personally took the responsibility of giving the news to Stoltz, stating that it was &quot;the hardest meeting I&#x27;ve ever had in my life and it was all my fault. I broke his heart&quot;. Gale explained that the recasting did not reflect on Stoltz&#x27;s acting abilities, but they had just cast the wrong person.

With Fox in the role, Zemeckis had to reshoot the previous five weeks of filming with a new leading man. Fox was 23 years old when he took on the role of 17-year-old Marty in 1985. The producers were impressed by Fox&#x27;s sense of timing and comic ability. Zemeckis commented, &quot;He&#x27;s got the perfect blend of traditional leading man qualities. He&#x27;s vulnerable but he&#x27;s calm.&quot; As Fox had joined the production after filming had begun, he was forced to juggle filming of both the film and television series within a punishing schedule. This involved rehearsals for &quot;Family Ties&quot; from 10am until 6pm followed by filming &quot;Back to the Future&quot; from 6.30pm until 2.30am. Fox stated that the schedule was exhausting but worth the effort. Fox exclaimed that he could play Marty McFly in his sleep and wrote, &quot;that very nearly turned out to be the case&quot;. His presence changed the atmosphere on set and he had a good rapport with Lloyd. Gale said that as well as being a good actor and having a natural comedic ability, Fox &quot;gave the actors more to work with&quot;. Lloyd said that although he was worried about the replacement, he had a natural chemistry with Fox and found it easy to work with him. Fox assumed that his exhaustion would result in a poor performance and damage his career, but instead his anxieties benefited his portrayal of Marty: &quot;I barely knew where I was, and I didn’t really know what I was doing. That served the film because Marty&#x27;s supposed to be disoriented.&quot; For a scene in which Marty plays a cover version of the song &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; by Chuck Berry at a school dance, Fox had to be taught to play guitar by Paul Hanson. Fox recalled that he also could not dance, so he worked with a choreographer in order to move like a rock star. He wanted to incorporate all of the mannerisms of his favorite guitarists, including &quot;a Pete Townshend windmill, and Jimi Hendrix behind the back, and a Chuck Berry duck walk&quot;. Although Fox mimed the guitar playing and lip-synced the song in the scene, it was Tim May who played guitar, while the vocals were provided by Mark Campbell. Marty&#x27;s skateboarding sequences were choreographed by professional skateboarders Per Welinder and Bob Schmelze, who also taught Fox, Stoltz and their stunt doubles the skateboarding techniques.

While filming a scene for the third film, which involves Marty being strung up in a noose by Buford &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen and his gang, the stunt almost went seriously wrong. In his 2002 autobiography, &quot;Lucky Man: A Memoir&quot;, Fox recalled that he stood on a box for the first two takes as the shot only filmed the upper part of his body. When the scene failed to look realistic, he decided to try the stunt without the box. As a result, the rope blocked his carotid artery and caused him to lose consciousness for several seconds until Zemeckis realised that he was not acting. This incident later led Fox to contemplate whether his developing symptoms were related to the hanging before he was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Characteristics==

Marty McFly is the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; protagonist who is raised in Hill Valley, California, a fictional town set in 1985. He is a confident teenager who attends high school and dreams of becoming a rock star. He also lives in a family with various personal issues. He is the youngest of three children of George McFly and Lorraine Baines-McFly. He has a brother, Dave McFly, and a sister, Linda McFly. Marty&#x27;s girlfriend is Jennifer Parker and his best friend is Emmett Brown, a scientist Marty and Jennifer call &quot;Doc&quot;. In the third film, Marty meets his great-great paternal grandparents, Seamus and Maggie, who were Irish immigrants in 1885. He also meets their infant son William, Marty&#x27;s great-grandfather. Despite never explicitly being explained in the film, Gale confirmed that Marty met his friend Doc Brown when he was around 14 after hearing that Brown was a dangerous lunatic. Marty was curious, so he snuck into Doc&#x27;s lab and was fascinated by his inventions. Doc allowed him to help with his experiments and their friendship began. In the first film, Doc Brown introduces Marty to the time machine that he invented using a DMC Delorean, which Marty uses to time travel when the vehicle reaches 88 miles per hour.

===Personality===
In &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Marty is shown to be disappointed by his family, particularly his wimpish father and alcoholic mother. Marty enjoys playing electric guitar with his group The Pinheads and plays &quot;The Power of Love&quot; at a Battle of the Bands audition as his favorite band is Huey Lewis and the News. This ability gives him the opportunity to take the lead in 1955 when stepping in for Marvin at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance, where he shows the fictitious R&amp;B band named Marvin Berry and the Starlighters the chord changes for &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;. He is a talented skateboarder, often clinging onto the back of vehicles to gain extra speed when he is late for school. He also proves to be an excellent pistol shot, a skill he has honed by playing shooting games such as &quot;Wild Gunman.&quot;

Marty&#x27;s carefree attitude results in confrontations with his high school&#x27;s vice-principal in charge of discipline Mr. Strickland, who calls him a &quot;slacker&quot;, comparing him to his father. After Strickland warns him against associating with Doc Brown and claims that no McFly ever amounted to anything, Marty shows determination, stating that he will change history. When confronted with a challenging circumstance, Marty often uses the catchphrase &quot;This is heavy!&quot; He frequently loses his temper whenever he is accused of cowardice. For the sequels, Gale said that they wanted to establish a character flaw for Marty that he has to overcome and realised that he is a &quot;hothead&quot;, as demonstrated when he quickly becomes involved in a confrontation with the bully Biff Tannen. Gale said that this character flaw was then verbalised in Marty&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Nobody calls me chicken!&quot;, which he described as Marty&#x27;s &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot;. Marty eventually learns a valuable lesson about choosing to walk away from a fight and refuses a driving race challenge that could have caused his death.

Marty frequently uses pop culture references, particularly when adopting aliases throughout the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; series. In the first film, soon after waking up in the bedroom of Lorraine in 1955, he adopts the name &quot;Calvin Klein&quot; after she starts calling him that due to it being Marty&#x27;s brand of underwear. In the French dub of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, the name Calvin Klein was replaced by Pierre Cardin, after the French fashion designer. He also uses the alias &quot;Darth Vader, an extraterrestrial from the Planet Vulcan&quot;, thereby confusing &quot;Star Wars&quot; with &quot;Star Trek&quot;, while wearing a radiation suit to attempt to coerce George into asking Lorraine out to the dance. In the third film, he uses the name &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; after traveling back to 1885. He also mimics the tough guy personas of Travis Bickle played by Robert De Niro in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and Dirty Harry played by Eastwood while practising with a pistol.

===Physical appearance===
In &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Marty&#x27;s clothing reflects the fashion of 1985. He wears a pair of Levi&#x27;s jeans, paired with a buttoned shirt, a denim jacket with a puffer jacket on top and a pair of Nike Bruin shoes. In 1955, he wears a camp shirt, two-tone jacket and denim, later changing to a check jacket and tie. After time travelling with Doc Brown in the second film and arriving in the future on October 21, 2015, Marty wears a more futuristic outfit to blend in with the fashion of the era. His updated look features wearable technology, including a self-drying bomber jacket combined with jeans that have pockets worn on the outside and sneakers with automatic self-lacing technology. His skateboard is also replaced by a hoverboard. In the third film, after time travelling back to the year 1885, his outfit features a poncho and hat in a similar style to the Man with No Name, a film character portrayed by Eastwood.

====&quot;Back to the Future&quot;====

In 1985, eccentric scientist Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown invites Marty to join him at the Twin Pines Mall, where he shows him a time machine that he has invented out of a DeLorean. After inputting the date November 5, 1955, Libyan terrorists arrive and shoot him, as Doc Brown had used plutonium to power the DeLorean instead of building a nuclear weapon for them. During this exchange, Marty escapes from them in the time machine, accidentally traveling back to 1955 by reaching 88 miles per hour. There, he gets knocked over by a car in the place of his teenage father, George, which disrupts how his parents meet. After waking up in the bedroom of his teenage mother, Lorraine, she develops a crush on him. Marty contacts the younger version of Doc Brown and enlists his help to reunite his parents and travel back to 1985. He attempts to convince George to ask Lorraine out to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, where they are fated to kiss for the first time. In the process, he draws the attention of bully Biff Tannen, who frequently bullies George. Marty concocts a plan with George in which he will rescue Lorraine from Marty&#x27;s advances while they are parked in a car during the night of the dance in order to win her affections. That night Biff appears on the scene, taking Marty&#x27;s place in the car. When George finds Biff with Lorraine, he finally gains the courage to stand up to him and knocks him out with a punch, securing Lorraine&#x27;s affections. At the dance, Marty joins the band on stage and plays guitar, which results in George and Lorraine making their first kiss. Marty arrives at the Hill Valley clocktower in time to complete Doc Brown&#x27;s plan to send him back to the future by using a lightning strike as a power source for the DeLorean. The plan is successful and Marty travels back to 1985. There he finds that his exploits in the past have changed the future, as George is a novelist and Biff works for him. He discovers that Doc Brown is still alive having worn a bulletproof vest after Marty warned him about his fate in 1955.

====&quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;====
Doc Brown transports Marty and Jennifer to October 21, 2015 in the DeLorean to help their children, but their departure is witnessed by Biff. Their future selves have married and their teenage son, Marty Jr, will be arrested for getting involved in a robbery with Griff, Biff&#x27;s grandson. Jennifer is knocked unconscious by Doc Brown and left asleep while Marty disguises himself as Marty Jr and comes into contact with the elder Biff. Marty refuses Griff&#x27;s offer and gets into a hoverboard dash, resulting in Griff and his crew getting arrested instead of Marty Jr. Jennifer, who was left behind, is taken back to her 2015 home by the police after tracing her there using her fingerprints. Marty and Doc Brown rescue her while, unbeknownst to them, elder Biff steals their time machine and returns to 1955, where he gives his younger self a sports almanac from the future to use for gambling. When Marty returns to 1985, he discovers that Hill Valley is now a dystopia, with Biff becoming extraordinarily rich and corrupt. He had forcefully married Marty&#x27;s mother, Lorraine, and secretly murdered Marty&#x27;s father. He also legalized gambling in the process, becoming known as the &quot;Luckiest Man on Earth&quot;. Marty and Doc Brown return to 1955 again to steal the almanac from Biff. At the high school dance, Marty tracks down the almanac in young Biff&#x27;s possession while trying to avoid his other self. After a chase down a tunnel on his hoverboard, Marty succeeds in retrieving it from Biff. Doc Brown is accidentally transported back to 1885 after lightning strikes the DeLorean, leaving Marty stranded. Marty immediately receives a letter from Doc Brown, written on September 1, 1885, which informs him that he has traveled back in time. Marty then seeks the help of the 1955 version of Doc Brown.

====&quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;====

Marty finds the 1955 version of Doc Brown and informs him of the previous events. Using the letter that Doc Brown sent from 1885, they find the DeLorean hidden in a mineshaft, but also discover a tombstone with Doc Brown&#x27;s name on it. This reveals that he was shot and killed by Bufford &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen six days after he wrote the letter. Marty decides to travel back to 1885 in the DeLorean in an effort to save Doc Brown. After Doc Brown sets the date to September 2, 1885, Marty time travels and hides the DeLorean in a cave. In 1885, he meets his great-great-grandparents, Seamus and Maggie, and their son, his great-grandfather. He discovers that Doc Brown has made a new life as a blacksmith. Marty crosses paths with &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen, Biff&#x27;s great-grandfather, and gets into a brawl with him. He is rescued by Doc Brown while being hung from a noose by Tannen. The two concoct a plan to get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour to transport Marty back to 1985 and save the Doc from being shot by Tannen. While they plan their escape, Marty and Doc Brown meet a teacher named Clara Clayton and Doc Brown falls in love with her. During a festival, &quot;Mad Dog&quot; and Marty agree to a one-on-one showdown on the day that Marty is meant to travel back to 1985. During the showdown, Marty defeats &quot;Mad Dog&quot; and proceeds with their time travel plan, which involves pushing the DeLorean with a steam engine over a ravine. Finally, Doc Brown decides to stay in 1885 with Clara while Marty travels back to 1985 in the DeLorean. Upon arrival in 1985, the time machine is destroyed by an oncoming train, but Marty escapes. He reunites with Jennifer and decides to decline a street race with Needles. While pondering over the wreckage of the DeLorean, Doc Brown arrives in a new time machine that he has built from a steam engine, alongside his wife Clara and their children, and tells them to make their future a good one as it has yet to be written, before bidding them farewell.

=== Video games ===

In 1985, a &quot;Back to the Future&quot; video game loosely based on the film was released on the Commodore 64, featuring Marty as a playable character. Released by Electric Dreams, the game involves Marty interacting with other characters from the film and finding objects, while his progress is tracked by a photo of himself and his siblings disappearing. Another &quot;Back to the Future&quot; video game was released by LJN in 1989 on the Nintendo Entertainment System and features Marty running around Hill Valley to pick up clocks and avoid obstacles and enemies. This was followed in 1990 by &quot;Back to the Future Part II &amp; III&quot;, a side-scrolling platform game based on the second and third films, which was also released by LJN. A &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; video game was also published in 1990 by Image Works based on the film. A 1991 &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; video game was also released for 16-bit consoles, including the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amiga. In 1993, a video game titled &quot;Super Back to the Future Part II&quot; was published by Toshiba and developed by Daft for the Nintendo Super Famicom, which featured Marty as a playable character riding his hoverboard. In 2010, Telltale Games published &quot;Back to the Future: The Game&quot;, an episodic video game. Set after the film trilogy, it features the voice of A.J. LoCascio as Marty, the player character. Fox reprised his role in the crossover toys-to-life Lego video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;. Marty also appears alongside Doc Brown in the video game, &quot;Funko Fusion&quot;.

=== Stage ===

In 2014, a West End musical adaptation of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was announced. Both Zemeckis and Gale were involved in the production, with Jamie Lloyd as director and co-writer. The aim was to produce a stage show with the spirit of the film, but with some additional music and lyrics. It was due to launch in 2015, the 30th anniversary of the film, but was delayed when Jamie Lloyd left the project due to creative differences. Stage actor Olly Dobson debuted the role of Marty in &quot;Back to the Future: The Musical&quot;, which premiered at Manchester Opera House on 20 February 2020 and ran for 12 weeks before moving to the West End. In the London production at the Adelphi Theatre, he was succeeded by Ben Joyce. Casey Likes plays him in the Broadway production of the musical. For the North American tour that launched in June 2024 at Playhouse Square in Cleveland, Caden Brauch took on the role.

=== Other media ===
David Kaufman voices Marty in &quot;Back to the Future: The Animated Series&quot;, which ran for two seasons from 1991 to 1993. It follows the adventures of Marty, Doc and his wife Clara as they travel through time. Fox appeared as Marty in a television promo for the 2010 Scream Awards. Fox and Lloyd made an entrance in the DeLorean as Marty and Doc Brown on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on October 21, 2015, the day the characters traveled to in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;. In the scene, the two characters were shown to be unimpressed by technological progress in 2015. For the same date, on &quot;Back to the Future&quot; Day, CollegeHumor released a cartoon skit featuring Marty and Doc Brown, which showed how they would react to real life in 2015. In 2020, Fox dressed in Wild West clothing as Marty in a trailer to promote the Christmas song &quot;Holiday&quot; by Lil Nas X.

== Merchandise ==
=== Nike Mag ===

Marty&#x27;s futuristic light-up, self-tying shoes worn in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; were designed by Tinker Hatfield, a shoe designer at Nike. The company subsequently filed a patent in 2008 for a working prototype of the film prop designed by Tiffany Beers. In 2011, Nike launched the first replica light-up Nike Mag shoe, which was exclusively sold at auction with proceeds to the Michael J. Fox Foundation. This shoe still lacked the self-lacing technology. The auction was highly anticipated but limited to 1500 pairs. On Oct 21, 2015, Fox appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; where he introduced the Nike Mag shoe with power laces to be auctioned in 2016. Nike produced 89 pairs that were made available in a raffle in October 2016, with proceeds donated to Fox&#x27;s foundation.
=== Hoverboard ===

After Marty appeared in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; where he replaced his skateboard with a hoverboard, the invention of a real levitating board was in high demand. Rumours that a real hoverboard had been invented were fuelled by Zemeckis in a 30-minute documentary presented by Leslie Nielsen that aired on &quot;NBC Friday Night At The Movies&quot;, which was designed to promote the film. Zemeckis stated that hoverboards were real, but parent groups had not allowed manufacturers to produce them, although some were found and used in the film. In &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, Fox appeared using a pink Mattel-branded board that has the appearance of a skateboard but hovers a few inches above the ground. Various companies have since produced versions of the hoverboard using a variety of technologies. In 2012, Mattel released a replica of the hoverboard for children, although it did not have the ability to hover. In 2014, a viral online video involving Lloyd that promoted a working hoverboard was revealed to be a hoax created by Funny or Die.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
Following the release of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Marty received a largely positive response from critics. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; appreciated the comedy in Marty&#x27;s home life in 1985 and his adventures in 1955 and considered Fox&#x27;s performance to be funny. Roger Ebert favorably compared Marty&#x27;s story arc to Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, stating that he &quot;begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another&quot;. Kirk Ellis of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; made a similar comparison and described Fox&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;appealing&quot; stating that he was &quot;easily one of the more intelligent-looking young actors to cross a screen recently&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer Sheila Benson left an unfavorable review, describing Marty as &quot;big on brashness and energy, dangerously low on subtlety&quot;. Ray Loynd writing for &quot;Variety&quot; enjoyed the &quot;zestful&quot; performance of Fox, describing him as an &quot;Arthurian knight figure&quot; and his rendition of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; as an &quot;audience-grabbing scene&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; responded positively to Marty&#x27;s heavy metal riff and predicted that viewers would continue to love him for the next 30 years.

=== Cultural impact and legacy ===
&quot;Back to the Future&quot; was a commercial success and the highest grossing film at the box office in 1985. It spawned two sequels and transformed Fox into a box office star. Due to the success and popularity of the film trilogy, Marty McFly is widely considered to be Fox&#x27;s most celebrated film role. In the decades following the release of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, critics have reflected on the character&#x27;s impact. Marty McFly was listed as one of the ten greatest sci-fi movie characters of all time by Olly Dyche of &quot;MovieWeb&quot;, who described him as &quot;an incredibly cool character&quot; with &quot;enough charm to make anyone swoon&quot;. Eric Francisco of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; ranked him the seventh greatest movie character of the 1980s alongside Doc Brown. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine selected him as the 12th greatest movie character of all time. &quot;GQ&quot; chose Marty&#x27;s 1985 clothing as one of the most iconic movie outfits, specifying the &quot;double-denim, the flannel, the iconic red puffer vest&quot;. In a retrospective review, Justin Chang in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that &quot;Back to the Future&quot; is in essence Marty&#x27;s story, specifically his struggle to control his existence, and considered every other character in the film an &quot;afterthought&quot;. Kayla Turner of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; counted Marty as one of the film characters that defined the 1980s, describing him as a &quot;timeless cultural icon whose influence extends far beyond the decade&quot;. Reflecting on the &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; scene in &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; Jason Lipshutz of &quot;Billboard&quot; described Marty as &quot;one of the most beloved characters in film history&quot;. Emily Lackey writing for &quot;Bustle&quot; called him a &quot;pop culture icon&quot;. Fox has also been praised for his portrayal of Marty. &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Hadley Freeman attributed much of the timelessness of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; to his performance commenting, &quot;His bright-eyed charm and, yes, screwball energy give the film a joyful momentum that makes it an enduring pleasure&quot;. Mark Monahan writing for &quot;The Telegraph&quot; opined that &quot;Back to the Future&quot; would be a poorer film without Fox&#x27;s &quot;uniquely energetic charm&quot;. In a review, &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s Adam Smith opined that the film established Fox as &quot;the finest light-comedy actor of his generation&quot; and considered his portrayal of Marty as &quot;the most charming screen presence of the 80s&quot;. Tom Breihan of &quot;The A. V. Club&quot; said that it was difficult to imagine anyone as perfect as Fox in the role of Marty and described him as &quot;small and squinty and breezily charismatic&quot;.

Critics have paid tribute to a sequence in &quot;Back to the Future&quot; in which Marty takes to the stage at the high school dance, grabs a red Gibson ES-345 and leads a version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s song &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; in front of a crowd of 1950s teenagers. In the film, his performance motivates the character Marvin Berry to call up his cousin and hold up the phone so that he can hear the new sound. Ben Travis of &quot;Empire&quot; described the scene as &quot;Marty&#x27;s coolest moment, channelling all of the actor&#x27;s own rock star heroes&quot;. Gregory Wakeman of &quot;Yahoo! Entertainment&quot; considered it to be &quot;arguably the most iconic sequence of the entire movie&quot;. &quot;MovieWeb&quot; called it &quot;a staple of pop culture with innumerable movies and shows riffing on the scene&#x27;s premise&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; cited it as the greatest moment in the film. David Browne writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; highlighted that the scene could be viewed as problematic, as it implies that Marty, a white teenager, invented rock and roll and appropriates the music of Chuck Berry. The scene was reproduced in the stage adaptation but altered to remove the telephone conversation. According to Berry&#x27;s son, Charles Berry Jr., this was not viewed as problematic by his father or himself and he recognized that it was just a movie. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Jason Lipshutz commented that the scene defined &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and epitomised its lead character: &quot;Marty is a freight train, barging into high school gymnasiums and shootouts with terrorists and different dimensions with a hangdog charm and ease of knowing that he can skateboard past his problems.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot; listed the scene as one of the great moments in movie history.

Marty has been influential in popular culture and he has often been referenced in other media. Morty Smith of the American animated series &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; began as a parody of Marty McFly. He was the inspiration for the naming of the English band McFly. Tom Holland cited Marty as his main inspiration for Peter Parker in &quot;Spiderman: Homecoming&quot;. He said, &quot;My goal was to try and kind of be our generation&#x27;s Marty McFly.&quot; Japanese pro wrestler Kushida has dressed as Marty McFly as part of his ring character. In 2018, &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; opened a series with a skit involving host Sandi Toksvig dressed as Marty alongside Noel Fielding dressed as Doc Brown. &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; reported in 2018 that Marty had become an internet meme, in particular a scene in which he plays heavy rock at the school dance in 1955 and the teenagers fail to appreciate his music. The meme was used to express something considered too far ahead of its time, quoting Marty&#x27;s response &quot;Guess you’re not ready for that yet, but your kids are gonna love it&quot;. In October 2021, Daniel Craig reenacted a &quot;Back to the Future&quot; scene in the role of Marty with James Corden and Christopher Lloyd on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. Season 3 of &quot;Stranger Things&quot; includes numerous references to &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, including visual homages to the character. In the 2023 film &quot;The Flash&quot;, Marty is referenced as a joke when Barry Allen travels back in time to stop his mother from being murdered and changes history in the process. He is horrified to discover that Marty is portrayed by Stoltz in &quot;Back to the Future&quot; instead of Fox. When Fox joined British band Coldplay on stage at Glastonbury in 2024, Chris Martin explained, &quot;The main reason why we&#x27;re in a band is because of watching &quot;Back to the Future&quot;&quot;.

=== Awards and honours ===
For his portrayal of Marty McFly, Fox received several awards and nominations. In 1985, he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. He also won a Saturn Award for Best Actor in 1985 for the film. In 1986, he won a Jupiter Award for Best International Actor for the role.

<text>Marion Williams (August 29, 1927 – July 2, 1994) was an American gospel singer.

== Early years ==

Marion Williams was born in Miami, Florida, to a religiously devout mother and musically inclined father. She left school when she was nine years old to help support the family, and worked as a maid, a nurse, and in factories and laundries. She began singing in front of audiences while young. As was common in the area, Williams learned African American blues and jazz, alongside Caribbean calypso.

Poverty caused Williams to leave school at fourteen to work with her mother at a laundry, although she eventually graduated from Pacific Union College in 1987. She sang at church and on street corners, inspired by a wide range of musicians, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe and the Smith Jubilee Singers.

She stayed with gospel in spite of pressure to switch to popular blues tunes or the opera.

== Career ==
In 1946, while visiting a friend in Philadelphia, Williams happened to sing before an audience that included Clara and Gertrude Ward. They recognized her talent and offered her a job. A year later, she became part of the Famous Ward Singers. Her growling, hands-on-the-hips vocal style made her one of the group&#x27;s undisputed stars.

In 1958, she and other members of the Ward group formed the Stars of Faith. In 1965, Williams began her solo career. For the next 15 years, she toured the United States, Africa and the West Indies.

In 1992, critic and music historian Dave McGee, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, said &quot;One will come away from her recordings believing that she was nothing less than the greatest singer ever&quot;.

== Musical career ==

=== The Ward Singers ===
Williams was invited to join the Ward Singers when they heard her singing during a visit to a close friend in Philadelphia in 1946. Williams finally joined them in 1947, staying with them for eleven years. Her first recording with the group was &quot;How Far Am I from Canaan&quot; (1948), followed by the breakthrough &quot;Surely God Is Able&quot;, which launched Williams and the rest of the group into super-stardom. Their concerts were mobbed by frenzied fans.

=== Stars of Faith ===
Dissatisfied with the low pay she was receiving while starring for the group, Williams left the Ward Singers in 1958, followed by most of the rest of the group, to form the Stars of Faith. The new group was unable, however, to reproduce the success the Ward Singers had enjoyed, as Williams retreated from the spotlight to give other members of the group more opportunity to star. The group&#x27;s career recovered, however, in 1961, when it appeared in &quot;Black Nativity&quot;, an Off-Broadway production, and toured across North America and Europe.

=== Solo career ===
In 1965, Williams began a solo career. While in Miami for her mother&#x27;s funeral, she felt re-inspired to continue her career and began touring college campuses across the country. The recording that is perhaps her best-known hit, &quot;Standing Here Wondering Which Way to Go&quot;, is from this period.

Williams opens the 1990 video &quot;Amazing Grace with Bill Moyers&quot; singing the signature song. Later in the PBS production, she stylized the song in her own way. In 1991, she performed as a gospel singer in the film &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, though her scene is available only in the director&#x27;s cut. The movie was dedicated to her.

==== Television appearances ====
On &quot;Hootenanny&quot;, a musical variety television show, she performed &quot;Packin&#x27; Up&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got To Live The Life I Sing About In My Song&quot; as Marion Williams and Stars of Faith. Williams also performed two songs on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;; during the appearance she and Griffin sang a duet of &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot;. During this appearance she also discussed her international touring plans.

=== Music ===
A powerful singer with a preternaturally broad range, able to reach the highest registers of the soprano range without losing either purity or volume, she could also swoop down to growling low notes in the style of a country preacher.

=== Influence ===
Williams&#x27; singing helped make the Ward Singers nationally popular when they began recording in 1948, and also inspired rock and roll pioneer Little Richard&#x27;s signature wail.

== Honors and awards ==
Williams was honored by the MacArthur Foundation in 1993, stating that she was among &quot;the last surviving links to gospel&#x27;s golden age...one of the most versatile singers of her generation.&quot;

She was one of the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1993. Her tribute included an all-star lineup including appearances by Billy Preston, Little Richard, and Aretha Franklin.

== Personal life ==
Williams was an esteemed member and Church Mother at the BM Oakley Memorial Church of God in Christ in Philadelphia under the pastorate of the late Mother Irene A. Oakley.

Williams died at the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia on July 2, 1994, aged 66. She was interred at Ivy Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

By a classical result of Honsberger, the number of incongruent integer-sided triangles of perimeter formula_1 is given by the equations formula_2 for even formula_1, and formula_4 for odd formula_1.

48 is the order of full octahedral symmetry, which describes three-dimensional mirror symmetries associated with the regular octahedron and cube. 

There are 48 symmetries of a cube.

<text>49 (forty-nine) is the natural number following 48 and preceding 50.

==In mathematics==
Forty-nine is the square of the prime number seven and hence the fourth non-unitary square prime of the form &quot;p&quot;2.

It appears in the Padovan sequence, preceded by the terms 21, 28, 37 (it is the sum of the first two of these).

Along with the number that immediately derives from it, 77, the only number under 100 not having its home prime known ().

The smallest triple of three squares in arithmetic succession is (1,25,49), and the second smallest is (49,169,289).

49 is the smallest discriminant of a totally real cubic field.

49 and 94 are the only numbers below 100 whose all permutations are composites but they are not multiples of 3, repdigits or numbers which only have digits 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8, even excluding the trivial one digit terms.

49 = 7^2 and 94 = 2 * 47

The number of prime knots with 9 crossings is 49.

=== Decimal representation ===

The sum of the digits of the square of 49 (2401) is the square root of 49.

49 is the first square where the digits are squares. In this case, 4 and 9 are squares.

==== Reciprocal ====
The fraction is a repeating decimal with a period of 42:

: = (42 digits repeat)

There are 42 positive integers less than 49 and coprime to 49. (42 is the period.) Multiplying 020408163265306122448979591836734693877551 by each of these integers results in a cyclic permutation of the original number:

*020408163265306122448979591836734693877551 × 2 = 040816326530612244897959183673469387755102
*020408163265306122448979591836734693877551 × 3 = 061224489795918367346938775510204081632653
*020408163265306122448979591836734693877551 × 4 = 081632653061224489795918367346938775510204

The repeating number can be obtained from 02 and repetition of doubles placed at two places to the right:

==In chemistry==
* During the Manhattan Project, plutonium was also often referred to simply as &quot;49&quot;. Number 4 was for the last digit in 94 (atomic number of plutonium) and 9 for the last digit in Pu-239, the weapon-grade fissile isotope used in nuclear bombs.

==In religion==
* In Judaism: the number of days of the Counting of the Omer and the number of years in a Jubilee (biblical) cycle.
* In Buddhism, 49 days is one of the lengths of the intermediate state (bardo)

==In other fields==
Forty-nine is:
* &quot;49er&quot;, one who participated in the 1849 California Gold Rush. This meaning has endured and things continue to be referred to as &quot;49er,&quot; such as a member of the San Francisco 49ers team of the National Football League.
* A 49 is a party after a powwow or any gathering of American Indians, held by the participants. It is also type of song that is sung on such occasions. A 49 is typically held in an isolated place and features drumming and singing.

<doc id="399116" wikidata="Q7269099" url="?curid=399116" title="Quantum solvent">
<text>A quantum solvent is essentially a superfluid (aka a quantum liquid) used to dissolve another chemical species. Any superfluid can theoretically act as a quantum solvent, but in practice the only viable superfluid medium that can currently be used is helium-4, and it has been successfully accomplished in controlled conditions. Such solvents are currently under investigation for use in spectroscopic techniques in the field of analytical chemistry, due to their superior kinetic properties.

Any matter dissolved (or otherwise suspended) in the superfluid will tend to aggregate together in clumps, encapsulated by a &#x27;quantum solvation shell&#x27;. Due to the totally frictionless nature of the superfluid medium, the entire object then proceeds to act very much like a nanoscopic ball bearing, allowing effectively complete rotational freedom of the solvated chemical species. A quantum solvation shell consists of a region of non-superfluid helium-4 atoms that surround the molecule(s) and exhibit adiabatic following around the centre of gravity of the solute. As such, the kinetics of an effectively gaseous molecule can be studied without the need to use an actual gas (which can be impractical or impossible). It is necessary to make a small alteration to the rotational constant of the chemical species being examined, in order to compensate for the higher mass entailed by the quantum solvation shell. 

Quantum solvation has so far been achieved with a number of organic, inorganic and organometallic compounds, and it has been speculated that as well as the obvious use in the field of spectroscopy, quantum solvents could be used as tools in nanoscale chemical engineering, perhaps to manufacture components for use in nanotechnology.

<doc id="399119" wikidata="Q3835997" url="?curid=399119" title="Lock Up (American band)">
<text>Lock Up was a rock band that featured Tom Morello on guitar before Rage Against the Machine was formed.

The band was founded by the original guitar player Mike Livingston (formerly of The Mau-Mau&#x27;s) and Kevin Wood on bass. They had previously played together in the band Ella and the Blacks, which also included Brian Grillo and Brendan Mullen (founder of The Masque, the first L.A. punk rock club). Grillo became Lock Up&#x27;s lead singer. Grillo had worked several years before with Martin Atkins in the latter&#x27;s Brian Brain project, and then was known in Los Angeles for fronting Brian Grillo&#x27;s Wild Coyote Review.

The original drummer was Michael Lee, (later drummer with Sylvia Juncosa and with The Homebillies), who quit and was replaced briefly by D. H. Peligro, formerly of the Dead Kennedys and later in Red Hot Chili Peppers. After Peligro left, he was replaced by Vince Ostertag .

In early 1987, Lock Up signed a production deal with Third Story Music, which was the company associated with Herb Cohen, by Evan Cohen, who later ran Manifesto Records. Cohen brought the band to the attention of Anna Statman, who was an A &amp; R person at Slash Records. In 1988, Statman moved to a new job at Geffen Records, and Lock Up was her first signing at Geffen, in mid-1988.

Livingston left Lock Up in late 1987. In early 1988, Livingston was replaced by Morello.Chris Beebe on bass completed the lineup that released Lock Up&#x27;s sole album on Geffen Records, &quot;Something Bitchin&#x27; This Way Comes&quot;, which came out in 1989. The title of the album was based on Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;. Vince Ostertag was subsequently replaced by Jon Knox who played drums until the group disbanded.

Following the Lock Up break up, Jon encouraged bassist Tim Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Tom Morello and drummer Brad Wilk who unsuccessfully auditioned for Lock Up. This line-up went on to form Rage Against the Machine.

Most of Morello&#x27;s guitar with Lock Up is unlike his work with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave. His solos, in contrast to Livingston&#x27;s rootsy blues oriented style mainly consist of arpeggios, tapping and overall fast fretwork. Evidence of his experimenting with the toggle switch can be heard in a few tracks (&quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Bleeding&quot;, &quot;Nothing New&quot; and &quot;Punch Drunk&quot;).

The songs &quot;Punch Drunk&quot; and &quot;Half Man Half Beast&quot; were featured in the 1991 comedy film &quot;Ski School&quot;.

In 1997, Manifesto Records licensed the Lock Up album from Geffen, and released it on compact disc. After the release, Manifesto, Morello, and Morello&#x27;s label, Sony, got into a legal dispute over whether Manifesto could place a sticker on the compact disc that read &quot;Featuring Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine.&quot;

<text>The Chicago Urban League, established in 1916 in Chicago, Illinois, is an affiliate of the National Urban League that develops programs and partnerships and engages in advocacy to address the need for employment, entrepreneurship, affordable housing and quality education. As a consequence of the Northern Migration the League was established by an interracial group of community leaders as a resettlement organization assisting African-American migrants arriving in Chicago.

== History ==
Barbara A. Lumpkin was appointed Interim President and CEO of the Chicago Urban League in June 2018.

In the second quarter of 2021, the League received a $100,000 USD grant from Pfizer for a &quot;Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness Campaign&quot;.

When the solvent is water it is called a hydration shell or hydration sphere. The number of solvent molecules surrounding each unit of solute is called the hydration number of the solute.

A classic example is when water molecules arrange around a metal ion. If the metal ion is a cation, the electronegative oxygen atom of the water molecule would be attracted electrostatically to the positive charge on the metal ion. The result is a solvation shell of water molecules that surround the ion. This shell can be several molecules thick, dependent upon the charge of the ion, its distribution and spatial dimensions.

A number of molecules of solvent are involved in the solvation shell around anions and cations from a dissolved salt in a solvent. Metal ions in aqueous solutions form metal aquo complexes. This number can be determined by various methods like compressibility and NMR measurements among others.

==Relation to activity coefficient of an electrolyte and its solvation shell number==
The solvation shell number of a dissolved electrolyte can be linked to the statistical component of the activity coefficient of the electrolyte and to the ratio between the apparent molar volume of a dissolved electrolyte in a concentrated solution and the molar volume of the solvent (water):

==Hydration shells of proteins==

The hydration shell (also sometimes called hydration layer) that forms around proteins is of particular importance in biochemistry. This interaction of the protein surface with the surrounding water is often referred to as protein hydration and is fundamental to the activity of the protein. The hydration layer around a protein has been found to have dynamics distinct from the bulk water to a distance of 1 nm. The duration of contact of a specific water molecule with the protein surface may be in the subnanosecond range while molecular dynamics simulations suggest the time water spends in the hydration shell before mixing with the outside bulk water could be in the femtosecond to picosecond range, and that near features conventionally regarded as attractive to water, such as hydrogen bond donors, the water molecules are actually relatively weakly bound and are easily displaced. Solvation shell water molecules can also influence the molecular design of protein binders or inhibitors.

With other solvents and solutes, varying steric and kinetic factors can also affect the solvation shell.

<doc id="399136" wikidata="Q1062956" url="?curid=399136" title="Niagara Movement">
<text>The Niagara Movement (NM) was a civil rights organization founded in 1905 by a group of activists—many of whom were among the vanguard of African-American lawyers in the United States—led by W. E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter. The Niagara Movement was organized to oppose racial segregation and disenfranchisement. Its members felt &quot;unmanly&quot; the policy of accommodation and conciliation, without voting rights, promoted by Booker T. Washington. It was named for the &quot;mighty current&quot; of change the group wanted to effect and took Niagara Falls as its symbol. The group did not meet in Niagara Falls, New York, but planned its first conference for nearby Buffalo (at the last minute, to avoid disruptions, moved across the Niagara River to Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada). The Niagara Movement was the immediate predecessor of the NAACP.

==Background==

During the Reconstruction Era that followed the American Civil War, African Americans had an unprecedented level of civil freedom and civic participation. In the South, for the first time the former slaves could vote, hold public office, and contract for their labor. With the end of Reconstruction in the 1870s, their freedoms began to narrow. From 1890 to 1908, all the Southern states ratified new constitutions or laws that disenfranchised most blacks and significantly restricted their political and civil rights. After Democrats regained control of state legislatures they passed laws imposing legal racial segregation in public facilities. These policies were entrenched after the United States Supreme Court in 1896 ruled in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; that laws requiring &quot;separate but equal&quot; facilities were constitutional. The separate facilities for African Americans were often shabby, or they did not exist at all. 
The most prominent African-American spokesman during the 1890s was Booker T. Washington, leader of Alabama&#x27;s Tuskegee Institute. In an 1895 speech in Atlanta, Georgia, Washington discussed what became known as the Atlanta Compromise. He believed that Southern African-Americans should not agitate for political rights (such as exercising the right to vote or having equal treatment under the law) as long as they were provided economic opportunities and basic rights of due process. He believed they needed to focus on education and work, to raise their race. Washington politically dominated the National Afro-American Council, the first nationwide African-American civil rights organization.

By the turn of the 20th century, other activists within the African-American community began demanding a challenge to racist government policies and higher goals for their people than those advocated by Washington. They believed that Washington was &quot;accommodationist&quot;. Opponents included Northerner W. E. B. Du Bois, then a professor at Atlanta University, and William Monroe Trotter, a Boston activist who in 1901 founded the &quot;Boston Guardian&quot; newspaper as a platform for radical activism. In 1902 and 1903 groups of activists sought to gain a larger voice in the debate at the conventions of the National Afro-American Council, but they were marginalized because the conventions were dominated by Washington supporters (also known as Bookerites). Trotter in July 1903 orchestrated a confrontation with Washington in Boston, a stronghold of activism, that resulted in a minor melee and the arrest of Trotter and others; the event garnered national headlines.

In January 1904, Washington, with funding assistance from white philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, organized a meeting in New York to unite African American and civil rights spokesmen. Trotter was not invited, but Du Bois and a few other activists were. Du Bois was sympathetic to the activist cause and suspicious of Washington&#x27;s motives; he noted that the number of activists invited was small relative to the number of Bookerites. The meeting laid the foundation for a committee to include both Washington and Du Bois, but it quickly fractured. Du Bois resigned in July 1905. By this time, both Du Bois and Trotter recognized the need for a well-organized anti-Washington activist group.

==Founding==
Along with Du Bois and Trotter, Fredrick McGhee of St. Paul, Minnesota, and Charles Edwin Bentley of Chicago also recognized the need for a national activist group. The foursome organized a conference to be held July 11–13, 1905, in Buffalo, New York. 59 carefully selected anti-Bookerites were invited to attend; 29 showed up, including prominent community leaders and a notable number of lawyers. At the last minute, to avoid disruption, the meeting was moved to the Erie Beach Hotel in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada, across the Niagara River from Buffalo.

The organization founded at this meeting chose Du Bois as its general secretary and Cincinnati lawyer George H. Jackson as treasurer. It set up committees to oversee progress on the organization&#x27;s goals. State chapters would advance local agendas and disseminate information about the organization and its goals. Its name was chosen to reflect the site of its first meeting and to be representative of a &quot;mighty current&quot; of change its leaders sought to bring about. Seventeen founders were each appointed as state secretary to individually represent 17 of the states of the union:
*Massachusetts – CG Morgan
*Georgia – John Hope
*Arkansas – FB Coffin
*Illinois – CE Bentley 
*Kansas – B. S. Smith
*D.C. – L. M. Henshaw
*New York – G. F. Miller
*Virginia – James Robert Lincoln Diggs
*Colorado – C. A. Franklin
*Pennsylvania – G. W. Mitchell
*Rhode Island – Byron Gunner

===Inaugural meeting location===
The First Niagara Conference was originally scheduled for Buffalo, New York, but because of threatened disruptions from partisans of the politically powerful Booker T. Washington fled at the last minute to the Erie Beach Hotel in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada. Du Bois described the meeting as &quot;secret&quot;. One Bookerite, Clifford Plummer, traveled to Buffalo to check up on the proceedings, looked around, and &quot;happily&quot; reported back that there was no conference.

To disguise this, it was said that they were refused accommodation in Buffalo. However, no evidence supports this. According to contemporary reports, Buffalo hotels complied with a statewide anti-discrimination law passed in 1895, and in a recent article it is called an &quot;unlikely...legend&quot;.

===Declaration of Principles===
The attendees of the inaugural meeting drafted a &quot;Declaration of Principles,&quot; primarily the work of Du Bois and Trotter. The group&#x27;s philosophy contrasted with the conciliatory approach by Booker T. Washington, who proposed patience over militancy. The declaration defined the group&#x27;s philosophy and demands: politically, socially and economically. It described the progress made by &quot;Negro-Americans&quot;, 
&quot;particularly the increase of intelligence, the buy-in of property, the checking of crime, the uplift in home life, the advance in literature and art, and the demonstration of constructive and executive ability in the conduct of great religious, economic and educational institutions.&quot; 

It called for blacks to be granted manhood suffrage, for equal treatment for all American citizens alike. Very specifically, it demanded equal economic opportunities, in the rural districts of the South, where many blacks were trapped by sharecropping in a kind of indentured servitude to whites. This resulted in &quot;virtual slavery&quot;. The Niagara Movement wanted all African Americans in the South to have the ability to &quot;earn a decent living&quot;.
On the subject of education, the authors declared that not only should it be free, but it should also be made compulsory. Higher education, they declared, should be governed independently of class or race, and they demanded action to be taken to improve &quot;high school facilities.&quot; This they emphasized: &quot;either the United States will destroy ignorance, or ignorance will destroy the United States.&quot; They demanded for judges to be selected independently of their race, and for convicted criminals, white or black, to be given equal punishments for their respective crimes. 

In his address to the nation, W. E. B. Du Bois stated, &quot;We are not more lawless than the white race; we [are] more often arrested, convicted and mobbed. We want justice, even for criminals and outlaws.&quot; He called for the abolition of the convict lease system. Established after the Civil War before southern states built prisons, convicts were leased out to work as cheap laborers for &quot;railway contractors, mining companies and those who farm large plantations.&quot; Southern states had passed laws targeting blacks and leasing them out to pay off fines or fees they could not manage. The system continued, earning money for local jurisdictions and the state from leasing out prisoners. There was little oversight, and many prisoners were abused and worked to death. Urging a return to the faith of &quot;our fathers,&quot; the declaration appealed for every person to be considered equal and free.

The declaration also targeted the treatment blacks received from labor unions, often oppressed and not fully protected by their employers nor granted permanent employment. It validated the already announced affirmation that such protest against outright injustice would not cease until such discrimination did. Secondly, Du Bois and Trotter stated the irrationality of discriminating based on one&#x27;s &quot;physical peculiarities&quot;, whether it be place of birth or color of skin. Perhaps one&#x27;s ignorance, or immorality, poverty or diseases are legitimate excuses, but not the matters over which individuals have no control. Near its end, the document condemns the Jim Crow laws, the rejection of blacks for enlistment in the Navy and by the military academies, the non-enforcement of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments protecting the rights of blacks, and the &quot;unchristian&quot; behaviors of churches that segregate and show prejudice to their black brothers. The Declaration thanked those who &quot;stand for equality&quot; and the advancement of this cause.

===Opposition===

Booker T. Washington and his supporters tried to discourage growth of this rival movement. Washington, Thomas Fortune, and Charles Anderson met after learning of the Movement&#x27;s formation, and agreed to suppress news of it in the black press. They acquired supporters in Archibald Grimké and Kelly Miller, two moderates who had been friendly with Trotter, but had not been invited by Du Bois to the convention (Grimké was hired by Fortune&#x27;s &quot;New York Age&quot;). The &quot;Age&quot; editorialized that the Movement was little more than an attempt to tear down the house that Washington had labored to set up. A Boston supporter of Washington convinced the printer of Trotter&#x27;s &quot;Guardian&quot; to withdraw his services, but Trotter managed to continue printing anyway. Prominent white activists, including Francis Jackson Garrison and Oswald Garrison Villard (family of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, a hero of Trotter), refused to attend Trotter-organized commemorations of their father&#x27;s birth centennial. They chose a celebration organized by Bookerites.

Despite Washington&#x27;s attempts at suppression, Du Bois reported at the end of 1905 that a number of black publications had published accounts of the Movement&#x27;s activities, and it received further publicity as a consequence of Bookerite press attacks against it. Washington also attacked the Constitution League, a multi-racial civil rights group that was also opposed to his accommodationist policies. The Niagara Movement made common cause with this organization.

After the initial meeting, delegates returned to their home territories to establish local chapters. By mid-September 1905, they had established chapters in 21 states, and the organization had 170 members by year&#x27;s end. Du Bois founded a magazine, &quot;The Moon&quot;, in an attempt to establish an official mouthpiece for the organization. Due to lack of funding, it failed after a few months of publication. A second publication, &quot;The Horizon&quot;, was started in 1907 and survived until 1910.
The movement&#x27;s second meeting, the first to be held on U.S. soil and arguably the movement&#x27;s high point, took place at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, the site of abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s 1859 raid. The three-day gathering, from August 15 to 18, 1906, took place at the campus of Storer College (now part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park). The Hill Top House Hotel hosted many of the guests. Convention attendees discussed how to secure civil rights for African Americans, and the meeting was later described by Du Bois as &quot;one of the greatest meetings that American Negroes ever held.&quot; Attendees walked from Storer College to the nearby Murphy Family farm, relocation site of the historic fort where John Brown&#x27;s quest to end slavery reached its bloody climax. Once there, they removed their shoes and socks to honor the hallowed ground and participated in a ceremony of remembrance.

Several of the organization&#x27;s chapters made substantive contributions to the advance of civil rights in 1906. The Massachusetts chapter successfully lobbied against state legislation for the segregation of railroad cars, but was unable to stop the state from helping to fund the Jamestown Exposition, a commemoration of the founding of racially motivated Jamestown, Virginia, in which Virginia sought to limit black admission. The Illinois chapter convinced Chicago theater critics to ignore a production of &quot;The Clansman&quot;.

During the early months of 1906 friction began to develop between Du Bois and Trotter over the admission of women to the organization. Du Bois supported the idea, and Trotter opposed it, but eventually relented, and the matter was smoothed over during the 1906 meeting. Their division became more significant when Trotter split with longtime supporter and Movement member Clement Morgan over Massachusetts politics and control of the local Movement chapter, with Du Bois siding with the latter. When the Movement met in Boston in 1907 Du Bois not only admitted Grimké and Miller to the organization, he reappointed Morgan to a leading position in the organization. Further attempts to heal the rift failed, and Trotter then resigned from the Movement.

In 1906 there were several proposals floated in the black press that the Movement be merged with other organizations. None of these proposals got off the ground, with the only substance being a meeting between the Movement&#x27;s Washington, DC chapter and members of the Bookerite National Afro-American Council.
The Movement, in conjunction with the Constitution League (which took Du Bois on as a director), began organizing legal challenges to segregationist laws in early 1907. For an organization with a limited budget, this was an expensive proposition: the single case they mounted challenging Virginia&#x27;s railroad segregation law put the organization into debt.

Du Bois had sought to return to Harpers Ferry for the 1907 annual meeting, but Storer College refused to grant them permission, claiming the group&#x27;s presence in 1906 had been followed by financial and political pressure from its supporters to distance itself from them. The 1907 meeting was held in Boston, with conflicting attendance reports. Du Bois claimed 800 attendees, while the Bookerite &quot;Washington Bee&quot; claimed only about 100 in attendance. The convention published an &quot;Address to the World&quot; in which it called on African-Americans not to vote for Republican Party candidates in the 1908 presidential election, citing President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s support for Jim Crow laws.

==End of the Movement==
William Monroe Trotter&#x27;s departure after the 1907 meeting had a serious negative impact on the organization, as did disagreements about which party to support in the 1908 election. Du Bois, with some reluctance, endorsed Democratic Party candidate William Jennings Bryan, but many African-Americans could not bring themselves to break from the Republicans, and William Howard Taft won the election, receiving significant African-American support. The 1908 annual meeting, held in Oberlin, Ohio, was a much smaller affair, and exposed disunity and apathy within the group at both local and national levels. Du Bois invited Mary White Ovington, a settlement worker and socialist he had met in 1904, to address the organization. She was the only white woman to be so honored. By 1908, Washington and his supporters successfully made serious inroads with the press (both white and black), and the Oberlin meeting received almost no coverage. Believing the Movement to be &quot;practically dead&quot;, Washington also prepared an obituary of the organization for the &quot;New York Age&quot; to publish.

In 1909, chapter activities continued to dwindle, membership dropped, and the 1910 annual meeting (held at Sea Isle City, New Jersey) was a small affair that again received no significant press. It was the organization&#x27;s last meeting.

==Legacy==
In the wake of the Springfield Race Riot of 1908, a major race riot in Springfield, Illinois, a number of prominent white civil rights activists called for a major conference on race relations. Held in New York City in early 1909, the conference laid the foundation for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which was formally established in 1910. In 1911, Du Bois (who was appointed the NAACP&#x27;s director of publications) recommended that the remaining membership of the Niagara Movement support the NAACP&#x27;s activities. William Monroe Trotter attended the 1909 conference, but did not join the NAACP; he instead led other small activist civil rights organizations and continued to publish the &quot;Guardian&quot; until his death in 1934.

The Niagara Movement did not appear to be very popular with the majority of the African-American population, especially in the South. Booker T. Washington, at the height of the Movement&#x27;s activities in 1905 and 1906, spoke to large and approving crowds across much of the country. The 1906 Atlanta Race Riot hurt Washington&#x27;s popularity, giving the Niagarans fuel for their attacks on him. However, given that Washington and the Niagarans agreed on strategy (opposition to Jim Crow laws and support of equal protection and civil rights) but disagreed on tactics, a reconciliation between the factions began after Washington died in 1915. The NAACP went on to become the leading civil rights organization for African Americans in the 20th century.

<text>53 (fifty-three) is the natural number following 52 and preceding 54. It is the 16th prime number.

==In mathematics==
Fifty-three is the 16th prime number. It is the second balanced prime, and fifth isolated prime.

53 is a sexy prime with 47 and 59. It is the eighth Sophie Germain prime, and the ninth Eisenstein prime. 

The sum of the first 53 primes is 5830, which is divisible by 53, a property shared by only a few other numbers.

53 cannot be expressed as the sum of any integer and its decimal digits, making 53 the ninth self number in decimal.

53 is the smallest prime number that does not divide the order of any sporadic group, inclusive of the six pariahs; it is also the first prime number that is not a member of Bhargava&#x27;s prime-universality criterion theorem (followed by the next prime number 59), an integer-matrix quadratic form that represents all prime numbers when it represents the sequence of seventeen integers {2, ..., 47, 67, 73}.

In hexadecimal, 53 is 35, that is, the same characters used in the decimal representation, but reversed. Four additional multiples of 53 share this property: 371 = , 5141 = , 99,481 = , and 8,520,280 = 0. Aside from the trivial single digit numbers, these are the only numbers that share this property.

<text>Crispin Hellion Glover (born April 20, 1964) is an American actor, filmmaker and artist. He is known for portraying eccentric character roles on screen. His breakout role was as George McFly in &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985), which he followed by playing Layne, one of the leading roles in &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1986). Through the 1990s, Glover garnered attention for portraying smaller but notable roles, including Cousin Del in &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), Andy Warhol in &quot;The Doors&quot; (1991), Bobby McBurney in &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; (1993) and the Train Fireman in &quot;Dead Man&quot; (1995).

Starting with his role as the Thin Man in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000), he began to star in more mainstream films. The roles in these films include reprising his Thin Man role in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003), portraying the titular character in &quot;Willard&quot; (2003), Grendel in &quot;Beowulf&quot; (2007), The Knave of Hearts in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010) and Phil in &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot; (2010). From 2017 to 2021 he starred as Mr. World in the Starz television series &quot;American Gods&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Glover started his company, Volcanic Eruptions, which publishes his books such as &quot;Rat Catching&quot; (1988) and also serves as the production company for the films he has directed, &quot;What Is It?&quot; (2005) and &quot;It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine.&quot; (2007). These films have never received a traditional theatrical release; instead, Glover tours with the films, holding screenings in theatres around the world.

==Early life==
Glover was born in New York City. He moved to Los Angeles with his family at the age of five. He is the son of actor Bruce Glover and actress and dancer Marion Elizabeth Lillian &quot;Betty&quot; Krachey, who retired upon his birth. He was named after the Saint Crispin&#x27;s Day speech from William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry V&quot;, which his parents enjoyed. &quot;Hellion&quot;, his real middle name, had earlier been used as a false middle name by his father, who did not like his own real Germanic middle name, Herbert.

Glover&#x27;s father is of English, Czech, and Swedish descent, while his mother has Czech and German ancestry. As a child, Glover attended the Mirman School from first through ninth grades. He then attended both Venice High for 10th and 11th grades, and Beverly Hills High School for 12th grade; he graduated in 1982.

==Career==

===Acting===

Glover began acting professionally at the age of 13, his first role being Friedrich von Trapp in a theatre production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with Florence Henderson. He appeared in several sitcoms as a teenager, including &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Family Ties.&quot; He appeared in a main role alongside Nicolas Cage in a television pilot titled &quot;The Best Of Times&quot; (1981) which aired on ABC, but was never picked up by the network. His first film role was in &quot;My Tutor&quot; (1983), which he subsequently followed with roles in &quot;Teachers&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot; (both 1984). He then worked with director Trent Harris on the third chapter of the Beaver Trilogy, entitled &quot;The Orkly Kid&quot; (1985).

His breakout role was as George McFly in Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985), an international box office success. His character was the father of Marty McFly, despite being three years younger than Michael J. Fox in real life. During filming, Glover vocalized his objections to the film&#x27;s ending, believing it to be too capitalistic and materialistic in intent. Zemeckis ignored his complaints. Due to these initial disagreements and a salary dispute, Glover did not return for either of the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; sequels and his role was taken over by Jeffrey Weissman.

After the success of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Glover sought to star in films that &quot;questioned&quot; the status quo and contained themes that aligned with his own interests. This pursuit led him to star as Layne in &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1986). Struggling to find any other films that reflected his own interests, Glover sought to work with film directors he admired. These include David Lynch on &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990) and &quot;Hotel Room&quot; (1993), John Boorman on &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; (1990), Dennis Hopper on &quot;Chasers&quot; (1994), and Miloš Forman on &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; (1996). He also became the first actor to portray Andy Warhol in a widely released film, Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;The Doors&quot; (1991).

Beginning in the 2000s, Glover chose the funding of his own films as a filmmaker to be the primary factor in deciding what films he would act in. After this decision, Glover would feature more prominently in more mainstream films, starting with &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000), playing the role of The Thin Man, a role he would reprise in the 2003 sequel. The character had initially been written as a speaking role, but Glover, noting that the lines as written were exposition, convinced the producers to eliminate the lines to create a precise image for the character. He would go on to portray the titular character in &quot;Willard&quot; (2003), his first time portraying the protagonist in a studio-funded film. Glover appeared in &quot;Beowulf&quot; (2007), as the creature Grendel, playing the part through performance capture technology. The film was his first collaboration with director Robert Zemeckis since the original &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. In 2010, Glover played Ilosovic Stayne/the Knave of Hearts in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and the one-armed bellhop Phil in &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot;.

Glover portrayed his first series regular role on television as Mr. World in &quot;American Gods&quot; (2017–2021), while continuing to still act in films like &quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&quot; (2018) and Roger Avery&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Day&quot; (2019). He reunited with &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot; director Tim Hunter on the Bret Easton Ellis-scripted slasher film &quot;Smiley Face Killers&quot; (2020), as the main antagonist. In 2022, he appeared in the Netflix horror anthology series &quot;Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s Cabinet of Curiosities&quot; in the episode &quot;Pickman&#x27;s Model&quot; (based on the H. P. Lovecraft work of the same name), as the title character.

===Filmmaking===

Glover made his directorial debut with 2005&#x27;s &quot;What Is It?&quot;, a surreal film featuring a cast of actors with Down syndrome. He considers it to be part of a trilogy he has dubbed the &quot;It?&quot; trilogy. It premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. With a budget of only $150,000, it took almost a decade to complete, and was originally intended to be a short film. Most of the primary footage was shot in 12 days, stretched over a two-and-a-half-year period.

Glover&#x27;s second film and second part of the &quot;It?&quot; trilogy, &quot;It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine.&quot;, was written by Utah writer and actor Steven C. Stewart. Stewart was born with severe cerebral palsy and had been confined to a nursing home for about 10 years. The film is a fantastical psychosexual retelling of life from Stewart&#x27;s point of view. Production was mostly funded by Glover&#x27;s salary earned from &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and other films. It premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival.

Aside from select film festivals, Glover has not screened either film outside the confines of his live performances, which have taken place at theatres and venues around the world. The films have received accolades from associations such as the Ann Arbor Film Festival and Sitges Film Festival. In 2013, Glover was recognized for his directorial work when the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City staged the series &quot;It Is Crispin Hellion Glover&quot;. The program consisted of screenings of all of his directorial work, live performances, and speaking engagements.

Glover has completed shooting his third feature film as a director, which he developed as a vehicle for his father Bruce Glover and himself to act together. He shot the film on his property in the Czech Republic. This film is not part three of the &quot;It?&quot; trilogy.

He lists Luis Buñuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Stanley Kubrick and Werner Herzog as influences on his filmmaking. Glover was a co-interlocutor with Norm Hill and Werner Herzog for the special feature commentary for the DVD of Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Even Dwarfs Started Small&quot; and &quot;Fata Morgana&quot;, in which he spoke of their influence on &quot;What Is It?&quot;.

===Books===
Glover, himself, reports to have published between 15 and 20 books. &quot;Oak-Mot&quot;, &quot;Rat Catching&quot; and other titles he has created are featured prominently during his live show presentation entitled &quot;Big Slide Show&quot;, where he reads aloud and performs sections of the books while visual art from the books are projected behind him.

He constructs the books by reusing old novels and other publications that have fallen into the public domain due to their age (for example, &quot;Rat Catching&quot; was constructed from an 1896 book &quot;Studies in the Art of Rat Catching&quot;, and &quot;Oak-Mot&quot; was constructed from an 1868 novel of the same title). He rearranges text, blacks out certain standing passages, and adds his own prose (and sometimes images) into the margins and elsewhere, thus creating an entirely new story. Six of his books have been published to be bought publicly so far, through his publishing company, Volcanic Eruptions. Other known titles include &quot;The Backward Swing&quot; and &quot;A New World&quot;.

* &quot;Billow and the Rock&quot; (1983)
* &quot;Rat Catching&quot; (1988)
* &quot;Oak-Mot&quot; (1989)
* &quot;Concrete Inspection&quot; (1990)
* &quot;What it is, and How it is Done&quot; (1992)
* &quot;Round My House&quot; (2016)
* The publishing years listed above may not represent first-edition publication dates, but subsequent available editions.

He also wrote a short essay for Adam Parfrey&#x27;s book &quot;Apocalypse Culture II&quot; in 2000. Sharing a title with his directional debut, &quot;What Is It?&quot;, the essay is an overtly provocative questioning of the cooperate restraints on American contemporary media and society.

===Music===
In 1989, during a hiatus from films, Glover released an album titled &quot;The Big Problem Does Not Equal the Solution, The Solution Equals Let It Be&quot; through Restless Records, produced by Barnes &amp; Barnes. The album features original songs such as &quot;Clowny Clown Clown&quot;, odd versions of Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;, and Charles Manson&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Say Never to Always&quot; (sung in falsetto), and readings from his art books &quot;Rat Catching&quot; and &quot;Oak Mot&quot;. Sample pages from these books are featured in the album&#x27;s liner notes. He also directed a music video for &quot;Clowny Clown Clown&quot;.

Glover recorded a version of the Michael Jackson song &quot;Ben&quot; to coincide with the release of his 2003 film &quot;Willard&quot;; the song had been written for the sequel to the original 1971 version of the film. In the music video for the song directed by Glover, he sings to a rat named Ben in front of a crowd of aroused women.

Several songs using Glover&#x27;s name as the title have been recorded by various artists, including shoegaze/gothic rock band Scarling., Chicago outsider musician Wesley Willis, and a New Jersey–based band called Children in Adult Jails.

==Personal life==
Glover has residences in Los Angeles, New York City, and the Czech Republic. His residence Zámek Konárovice, 45 minutes east of Prague by train, is a 17th-century chateau that is recognized as historically significant by the Czech government. The property requires constant upkeep and restoration; according to Glover, &quot;[The property] is a lifetime project that will be in continuous flux and repair for hundreds of years from now, as it has been the hundreds of years before I &#x27;owned&#x27; it.&quot;

Glover is single, and has no children, citing his busy career as one of the reasons for which he feels unfit to be a father, as he feels that a father should be there for his children. From 2001 to 2003, Glover dated Alexa Lauren, a &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine &#x27;Pet of the Month&#x27; for September 1999.

===&quot;Late Night&quot; appearance===
Glover appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; on July 28, 1987, to promote &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot;. To the surprise of Letterman and the audience, Glover appeared wearing platform shoes and a wig. During the interview, Glover behaved erratically and nearly kicked Letterman in the face, causing Letterman to walk off the set, to get the &quot;Top-10 List&quot; ready. Four years later, the film &quot;Rubin &amp; Ed&quot; premiered, in which Glover had a starring role as titular character Rubin Farr. After the release of &quot;Rubin &amp; Ed&quot;, some speculated that Glover was acting in-character as Rubin Farr during his appearance on &quot;Late Night&quot;. Glover has refused to go into detail about the reasons for his behavior on the show, other than to mention that he was flattered that fans are still speculating on the performance decades later. The character Rubin Farr also appears in Glover&#x27;s music entitled &quot;Clowny Clown Clown&quot; and in the song&#x27;s videoclip.

===&quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; lawsuit===
In &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, Zemeckis reused brief footage of Glover that had been filmed for the first film. Glover was billed as &quot;George McFly in footage from &quot;Back to the Future&quot;&quot; in the closing credits. The older footage was combined with new footage of actor Jeffrey Weissman wearing a false chin, nose and cheekbones, and various obfuscating methods – in the background, wearing sunglasses, rear shot, upside down – to play George McFly. Because these methods suggested that Glover himself had performed for the film, he successfully sued the producers on the grounds that they had used his likeness without permission, as well as not having paid him for the reuse of the footage from the original film. The case was resolved outside of court and Glover was awarded a reported $760,000. As a result of the lawsuit, clauses in the Screen Actors Guild collective bargaining agreements now state that producers and actors are not allowed to use such methods to reproduce the likeness of other actors, effectively putting to an end the decades-long use of the Fake Shemp technique among living actors. The lawsuit is often evoked in cases for actors involving the misuse of their likeness through digital recreation and other technological methods to replicate their appearance without their permission.

<text>The Spanish Colonial Revival architecture (), often known simply as Spanish Revival, is a term used to encompass a number of revivalist architectural styles based in both Spanish colonial architecture and Spanish architecture in general. These styles flourished throughout the Americas, especially in former Spanish colonies, from California to Argentina.

In the United States, the earliest use of this style was in Florida and California. St. Augustine, Florida was founded on September 8, 1565, by Spanish admiral Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, Florida&#x27;s first governor. The city had served as the capital of Florida for over 250 years when Spain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819. By the late 1880s, St. Augustine was being developed by Henry M. Flagler as a winter resort for wealthy northern families. He built two grand hotels in the Mediterranean Revival and Spanish Revival styles: the Ponce de Leon Hotel (Carrère and Hastings, 1882) and the Alcazar Hotel (Carrère and Hastings, 1887). These influenced the development of the Spanish Colonial Revival style. A few years later, at the Panama–California Exposition of 1915 in San Diego, highlighting the work of architect Bertram Goodhue, Spanish Colonial Revival was given further national exposure. Embraced principally in Florida and California, the Spanish Colonial Revival movement enjoyed its greatest popularity between 1915 and 1931.

In Mexico, the Spanish Colonial Revival in architecture was tied to the nationalist movement in the arts encouraged by the post–Mexican Revolution government. The Mexican style was primarily influenced by the Baroque architecture of central New Spain, in contrast to the U.S. style which was primarily influenced by the northern missions of New Spain. Subsequently, the U.S. interpretation saw popularity in Mexico and was locally termed &quot;colonial californiano&quot;.

Modern-day tract home design in Southern California and Florida largely descends from the early movement. The iconic terracotta shingles and stucco walls have been standard design of new construction in these regions from the 1970s to present.

==Development of style==

===Mediterranean Revival===
The antecedents of the Spanish Colonial Revival Style in the United States can be traced to the Mediterranean Revival architectural style. In St. Augustine, Florida, a former Spanish colony, a winter playground was developing for wealthy people from northern cities in the United States. Three architects from New York City John Carrère and Thomas Hastings of Carrère and Hastings and Bostonian Franklin W. Smith, designed grand, elaborately detailed hotels in the Mediterranean Revival and Spanish Revival styles in the 1880s. With the construction of the Ponce de Leon Hotel (designed by Carrère and Hastings, 1882), the Alcazar Hotel (Carrère and Hastings, 1887), and the Casa Monica Hotel (later the Hotel Cordova) built by Franklin W. Smith in 1888, Spanish-influenced architecture spread to several other parts of Florida. These three hotels were influenced not only by the centuries-old buildings remaining from the period Spanish rule in St. Augustine but also by &quot;The Old City House&quot;, constructed in 1873 and still standing, an excellent example of early Spanish Colonial Revival architecture.

===Mission Revival===
The possibilities of the Spanish Colonial Revival Style were brought to the attention of architects attending late 19th and early 20th centuries international expositions. For example, California&#x27;s Mission Revival style Pavilion in white stucco at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, and the Mission Inn, along with the Electric Tower of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1900 introduced the potential of Spanish Colonial Revival. They also integrated porticoes, pediments and colonnades influenced by Beaux Arts classicism as well.

===Florida===


By the early years of the 1910s, Florida was major center for Spanish Colonial Revival style in the United States. Frederick H. Trimble&#x27;s Farmer&#x27;s Bank in Vero Beach, completed in 1914, is a fully mature early example of the style. The city of St. Cloud, Florida, espoused the style both for homes and commercial structures and has a fine collection of subtle stucco buildings reminiscent of colonial Mexico. Many of these were designed by architectural partners Ida Annah Ryan and Isabel Roberts.

One of the most significant examples of the emerging popularity of Spanish Colonial Revival in the United States at the time was is the architecture of Coral Gables, Florida. A planned city established in the 1920s, the city&#x27;s architecture is almost entirely Mediterranean Revival style, mandated in the original plan. The city was developed by George E. Merrick, a real estate developer from Pennsylvania, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The Coral Gables Congregational Church, donated by Merrick, and the Catholic Church of the Little Flower, were classic examples of the Spanish Renaissance style. 
Early in the city&#x27;s planning and development, Merrick shared his vision for Coral Gables as &quot;a most extraordinary opportunity for the building of &#x27;Castles in Spain&#x27;. Merrick&#x27;s success in executing this vision for the city would catch the attention of Spain&#x27;s King, Alfonso XIII, who awarded Merrick the Order of Isabella the Catholic for his support of Spanish culture in Coral Gables.

Several other cities in southern Florida showcased the Spanish Revival of the time, including Palm Beach. The Palm Beach Town Hall, built in 1925 by Harvey and Clarke, with renovations later made by several notable architects.

===California===

The major location of design and construction in the Spanish Colonial Revival style was California, especially in the coastal cities. In 1915 the San Diego Panama–California Exposition, with architects Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow Sr., popularized the style in the state and nation. It is best exemplified in the California Quadrangle, built as the grand entrance to that Exposition. In the early 1920s, architect Lilian Jeannette Rice designed the style in the development of the town of Rancho Santa Fe in San Diego County.

The city of Santa Barbara adopted the style to give it a unified Spanish character after widespread destruction in the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake. The County Courthouse designed by William Mooser III and the Arlington Theatre designed by Edwards and Plunkett are prime examples. George Washington Smith designed many residences in Santa Barbara including Casa del Herrero and Jackling House, along with businesses Lobero Theatre and the Santa Barbara News-Press.

Real estate developer Ole Hanson favored the Spanish Colonial Revival style in his founding and development of San Clemente, California in 1928. The Pasadena City Hall by John Bakewell, Jr. and Arthur Brown, Jr., the Sonoma City Hall, and the Beverly Hills City Hall by Harry G. Koerner and William J. Gage are other notable civic examples in California. Between 1922 and 1931, architect Robert H. Spurgeon constructed 32 Spanish colonial revival houses in Riverside and many of them have been preserved.

===Mexico===

 The Spanish Colonial Revival of Mexico has a distinct origin from the style developed in the United States. Following the Mexican Revolution, there was a wave of nationalism that emphasized national culture, including in architecture. The neocolonial style arose as a response to European eclecticism (favored during the Porfiriato). The 1915 book &quot;La patria y la arquitectura nacional&quot; by architect Federico E. Mariscal (es) was influential in advocating viceregal architecture as integral to national identity. During the government of President Venustiano Carranza (serving 1917 to 1920), tax exemptions were offered to those that built houses in a colonial style. In the early 1920s there was a surge of houses built with Plateresque elements; such as grotesques, pinnacles and mixtilinear arches (es).

Secretary of Education José Vasconcelos (who shaped the cultural philosophy of the post-Revolution government) was an active promoter of neocolonial architecture. Traditional materials such as tezontle, cantera and Talavera tiles were incorporated into neocolonial buildings.

The colonial-era National Palace was significantly altered between 1926 and 1929: the addition of a third floor and changes to the facade. The modifications were done in a manner corresponding to the original style. Similarly, the colonial Mexico City government building was remodeled in the 1920s and a neocolonial companion building was built in the 1940s.

====Colonial californiano====
The style, as developed in the United States, came full circle to its geographic point of inspiration as in the late 1930s, single-family houses were built in Mexico City&#x27;s then-new upscale neighborhoods in what is known in Mexico as &quot;colonial californiano&quot; (Californian Colonial). That is, a Mexican reinterpretation of the California interpretation of Spanish Colonial Revival. Many houses of this style can still be seen in the Colonia Nápoles, Condesa, Polanco and Lomas de Chapultepec areas of Mexico City. The Pasaje Polanco shopping court is an example of the style&#x27;s application in commercial architecture.

===Australia===
Influential Australian architects such as Emil Sodersten and Professor Leslie Wilkinson brought back styles from Italy and Spain in the early 20th century convinced that Mediterranean styles would be well-suited for the Australian climate and lifestyle. Mediterranean style became popular in places like Sydney suburbs Manly and Bondi in the 1920s and 1930s. One variant, known as Spanish Mission or Hollywood Spanish, became popular as Australians saw films of and read in magazines about the glamorous mansions in that style that Hollywood movie stars had. Spanish mission houses began to appear in the wealthier suburbs, the most famous being Boomerang, at Elizabeth Bay. The Plaza Theatre in Sydney is a celebrated cinema in the style.

===China===
In the 1930s, numerous houses in Spanish Revival style were built in Shanghai, particularly in the former French Concession. Although Shanghai was not culturally linked to the Spanish-speaking world, these buildings were probably inspired by Hollywood movies, which were highly influential in the city at the time. Local architectural magazines of the period like &quot;The Chinese Architect&quot; and &quot;The Builder&quot; regularly printed detailed examples of the style for local builders to copy and implement.

===Spanish East Indies===

After being conquered and ruled for the Spanish crown, and for the most part being administered as a territory under the jurisdiction of the kingdom of New Spain (Mexico), the Philippines and Mariana islands received Iberian and Latin-American influences in its architecture. By the time the United States occupied the Philippines, the Mission-style and Spanish Colonial Revival architecture also arrived, with inspirations from California. American architects further developed this style in the Philippines, modernizing the buildings with American amenities.

The best example of the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture and California mission style is the famed Manila Hotel designed by William E. Parsons and built in 1909. Other examples exist throughout the country such as Gota de Leche, Paco Market, and thousands more, especially in the churches and cathedrals throughout the country.

==Design elements==
Spanish Colonial Revival architecture shares some elements with the earlier Mission Revival style derived from the architecture of the California missions, and Pueblo Revival style from the traditional Puebloan peoples in New Mexico. Both precedents were popularized in the Western United States by Fred Harvey and his Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Depots and Hotels. The Spanish Colonial Revival style is also influenced by the American Craftsman style and Arts and Crafts Movement.

Spanish Colonial Revival architecture is characterized by a combination of detail from several eras of Spanish Baroque, Spanish Colonial, Moorish Revival and Mexican Churrigueresque architecture. The style is marked by the prodigious use of smooth plaster (stucco) wall and chimney finishes, low-pitched clay tile, shed, or flat roofs, and terracotta or cast concrete ornaments. Other characteristics typically include small porches or balconies, Roman or semi-circular arcades and fenestration, wood casement or tall, double–hung windows, canvas awnings, and decorative iron trim.

Structural form:

* Rectangular, courtyard, or L-plan.
* Horizontal massing.
* Predominantly one-story.
* Interior or exterior courtyards.
* Asymmetrical shape with cross-gables and side wings.

==Notable architects==
One of the most accomplished architects of the style was George Washington Smith who practiced during the 1920s in Santa Barbara, California. His own residences &quot;El Hogar&quot; (1916, a.k.a. &quot;Casa Dracaena&quot;) and &quot;Casa del Greco&quot; (1920) brought him commissions from local society in Montecito and Santa Barbara. An example landmark house he designed is the Steedman estate &quot;Casa del Herrero&quot; in Montecito, now a registered National Historic Landmark and restored historic house—landscape museum. Other examples are the Jackling House and Lobero Theatre also in California.

<text>54 (fifty-four) is the natural number and positive integer following 53 and preceding 55. As a multiple of 2 but not of 4, 54 is an oddly even number and a composite number.

54 is related to the golden ratio through trigonometry: the sine of a 54 degree angle is half of the golden ratio. Also, 54 is a regular number, and its even division of powers of 60 was useful to ancient mathematicians who used the Assyro-Babylonian mathematics system.

It is also an abundant number, since the sum of its proper divisors (66) is greater than itself.

==In mathematics==
===Number theory===

54 is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (66), which excludes 54 as a divisor, is greater than itself. Like all multiples of 6, 54 is equal to some of its proper divisors summed together, so it is also a semiperfect number. These proper divisors can be summed in various ways to express all positive integers smaller than 54, so 54 is a practical number as well. Additionally, as an integer for which the arithmetic mean of all its positive divisors (including itself) is also an integer, 54 is an arithmetic number.

===Trigonometry and the golden ratio===
If the complementary angle of a triangle&#x27;s corner is 54 degrees, the sine of that angle is half the golden ratio. This is because the corresponding interior angle is equal to /5 radians (or 36 degrees). = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{\phi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.}} If that triangle is isoceles, the relationship with the golden ratio makes it a golden triangle. The golden triangle is most readily found as the spikes on a regular pentagram.

If, instead, 54 is the length of a triangle&#x27;s side and all the sides lengths are rational numbers, the 54 side cannot be the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem, there is no way to construct 54 as the sum of two other square rational numbers. Therefore, 54 is a nonhypotenuse number. 

However, 54 can be expressed as the area of a triangle with three rational side lengths. Therefore, it is a congruent number. One of these combinations of three rational side lengths is composed of integers: 9:12:15, which is a 3:4:5 right triangle that is a Pythagorean, a Heronian, and a Brahmagupta triangle.

===Regular number used in Assyro-Babylonian mathematics===
As a regular number, 54 is a divisor of many powers of 60. This is an important property in Assyro-Babylonian mathematics because that system uses a sexagesimal (base-60) number system. In base 60, the reciprocal of a regular number has a finite representation. Babylonian computers kept tables of these reciprocals to make their work more efficient. Using regular numbers simplifies multiplication and division in base 60 because dividing by can be done by multiplying by &#x27;s reciprocal when is a regular number.

For instance, division by 54 can be achieved in the Assyro-Babylonian system by multiplying by 4000 because = = 4000. In base 60, 4000 can be written as 1:6:40. Because the Assyro-Babylonian system does not have a symbol separating the fractional and integer parts of a number and does not have the concept of 0 as a number, it does not specify the power of the starting digit. Accordingly, 1/54 can also be written as 1:6:40. Therefore, the result of multiplication by 1:6:40 (4000) has the same Assyro-Babylonian representation as the result of multiplication by 1:6:40 (1/54). To convert from the former to the latter, the result&#x27;s representation is interpreted as a number shifted three base-60 places to the right, reducing it by a factor of 60.

===Graph theory===

The second Ellingham–Horton graph was published by Mark N. Ellingham and Joseph D. Horton in 1983; it is of order 54. These graphs provided further counterexamples to the conjecture of W. T. Tutte that every cubic 3-connected bipartite graph is Hamiltonian. Horton disproved the conjecture some years earlier with the Horton graph, but that was larger at 92 vertices. The smallest known counter-example is now 50 vertices.

==In literature==
In &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams, the &quot;Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot; famously was 42. Eventually, one character&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to divine the Ultimate Question elicited &quot;What do you get if you multiply six by nine?&quot; The mathematical answer was 54, not 42. Some readers who were trying to find a deeper meaning in the passage soon noticed the fact was true in base 13: the base-10 expression 54 can be encoded as the base-13 expression = 42. Adams said this was a coincidence.

<text>Mount Kitchener is a mountain located within the Columbia Icefield of Jasper National Park, which is part of the Canadian Rockies. The mountain can be seen from the Icefields Parkway (highway 93) near Sunwapta Pass.

Mt. Kitchener was originally named Mount Douglas by J. Norman Collie after David Douglas. In 1916, the mountain was renamed Mount Kitchener, its present-day name, after Lord Kitchener, who had just been killed in World War I.

<doc id="399152" wikidata="Q2459817" url="?curid=399152" title="Francis Cooke">
<text>Francis Cooke (c.1583 – April 7, 1663) was a Leiden Separatist, who went to America in 1620 on the Pilgrim ship &quot;Mayflower&quot;, which arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts. He was a founding member of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and a signer of the Mayflower Compact.

== Early life ==
Cooke&#x27;s ancestry is unknown, and there are no definite records regarding his birth. In Plymouth Colony in 1643, Cooke&#x27;s name appears on the list of those &quot;Able to Bear Arms&quot;. This suggests that he was under the age of sixty to be on such a list, and would probably have been born no earlier than 1583.

Cooke&#x27;s first appearance in the historical record occurs on April 25, 1603, in Leiden, Holland, where he is named a witness at Raphael Roelandt&#x27;s betrothal. Cooke lived in Leiden for about six years before the 1609 arrival of the congregation of English Separatists led by Pastor John Robinson. Cooke was betrothed to Hester Mahieu at the French Walloon Church in Leyden, the Vrouwekerk (&quot;Church of Our Lady&quot;). She had joined the church one month prior. Her family were Protestant (Walloon) refugees who left Lille in the Spanish Netherlands to escape religious conflict and persecution, and who then left for England. According to historian Charles Edward Banks, Leiden records show Francis Cooke&#x27;s betrothal to be June 9, 1603. In the Leiden church &quot;Betrothal Book&quot;, Cooke is recorded as &quot;Franchois Couck&quot; and his bride, Hester Mahieu, with the witnesses to the marriage being two Walloons. They are identified as &quot;..from England...&quot; (Francis) and &quot;...from Canterbury...&quot; (Hester). Cooke and his wife departed Leiden in August 1606 to go to Norwich, England. The Leiden congregation had some Separatist members who had fled from Norwich. The Cooke&#x27;s did not remain in Norwich long, because their son, John, was baptized at the Walloon Church in Leiden between January and March 1607, and then the couple, identified as &quot;Franchoys Cooke et Esther sa femme&quot; in the Leiden records, received communion on January 1, 1608.

In February 1609, members of Robinson&#x27;s church came to Leiden. The Cookes did not immediately become members, but did join the Leiden congregation sometime after daughter Elizabeth was baptized on December 26, 1611. When the congregation decided to go to America in 1620, Cooke and his thirteen year–old son John committed to the voyage, but his wife, Hester, and the younger children remained in Leiden, waiting until the colony was better established.

== The Mayflower Voyage ==

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed Plymouth, England, on , 1620. The small, 100-foot ship held 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped quarters. By the second month at sea, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales that caused the ship&#x27;s timbers to be badly shaken. The caulking failed to keep out seawater, and the passengers—even in their berths—lay wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions, contributed to the death of a crew member and a passenger.

They spotted Cape Cod Hook (now Provincetown Harbor), on after about nine weeks at sea. The vessel struggled for two days against strong winter seas while they tried to head south to their planned destination of the Virginia Colony. They were forced to abandon the effort, however, and return to the harbor at Cape Cod Hook. There they anchored on . The Mayflower Compact was signed later that day. Almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter that followed—in the space of just a few months.

== In Plymouth Colony ==
After the Pilgrims&#x27; arrival at Cape Cod, Cooke was one of those who signed the Mayflower Compact on November 11, 1620. William Bradford noted Cooke&#x27;s presence in his journal: &quot;...Francis Cooke and his son John ... but his wife and children came afterwards.&quot;

The plot of land for Cooke&#x27;s house in New Plymouth was assigned to them late in 1620. It was located between the plots of Isaac Allerton and Edward Winslow. In the Division of Land in 1623, Cooke received two acres, one for himself and one acre for his son John. He also received four &quot;Akers&quot; for his wife and children who &quot;...came ouer in the shipe called the Anne&quot; in 1623.

In his book, &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647&quot;, Bradford writes:
There was an agreement signed in 1626 in which fifty-eight planters, including Cooke and many other &quot;first comers&quot;, later known as &quot;Purchasers&quot;, bought from the Merchant Adventurers from London all their colony stock, shares, and land. Later these Purchasers assigned all shares and debts in the company to eight Plymouth notables, and four former Merchant Adventurers, then to be known as &quot;Undertakers&quot;. This was to be an investment organization with profits going largely to the colony.

In the 1627 Division of Cattle at Plymouth, Cooke and Hester are mentioned: &quot;The first lot fell to Francis Cooke &amp; his Companie Joyned to his wife Hester Cooke.&quot; Also named in the 1627 records were their children John, Jacob, Jane, Hester, and Mary as well as two men—Cooke&#x27;s nephew Phillip Delanoy (Delano) and Experience Mitchell, who married Cooke&#x27;s daughter, Jane, soon after.

On January 3, 1627/8, Cooke was one of six men named to lay out the boundaries for the twenty-acre land grants that would be made to everyone who came as a planter, under the employ of the joint-stock company. In early 1633, Cooke was assigned by the court to help resolve a dispute of a financial nature between Peter Browne and Dr. Samuel Fuller. These men are believed the men of the same names who were companions of Cooke on the Mayflower voyage, both dying later in 1633. During the 1630s and 1640s, Cooke held several public sector positions but was never in government or politics. In 1634, he was one of several Plymouth men tasked with laying out the highways. In 1637 he was appointed, along with others, to lay highways about the towns of Plymouth, Duxbury, and Eel River. Cooke and the others performed the task and two months later reported back to the Plymouth Court.

On October 1, 1636, John Harmon, son of Edmund Harmon, tailor, of London, became an apprentice to Cooke for seven years.

Cooke was awarded damages by the court on March 7, 1636/7 in a civil case involving the abuse of his cattle against Mr. John Browne the younger, who had previously been an assistant and magistrate. Others also charged, all being in the service of John Browne the elder and Thomas Willet, were Thomas Lettice, James Walker, and Thomas Teley. On June 7, 1637, due to Browne&#x27;s failure to the damages, the court reaffirmed the verdict and ordered John Browne to pay.

In May 1640, Cooke and his son John were among those tasked to compute the number of acres of Edward Doty&#x27;s meadows and make a report to the next court.

In October 1640, Cooke was appointed to compute the land boundaries between Thomas Prence and Clement Briggs at Jones River.

In 1640/41 he was one of twelve men tasked by the court to designate additional highways, and make a formal survey and mark the boundaries of plots of land in the town of Plain Dealing. The next year he was one of four Plymouth surveyors and was tasked to survey the highway for Jones River. In 1645 he was again highway surveyor for Plymouth. In June 1650, when he was almost seventy, he was still doing survey work, as when he and twelve others reported to the court that they had marked a new way from Jones River to the Massachusetts Path through John Rogers property. And even in August 1659, in his late 70s, he was again called upon by the Plymouth Court to resolve a land boundary dispute between Thomas Pope and William Shurtliff.

Although he was specially qualified to survey new highways, he did do other public service work, being on several petty and grand juries. He also served on civil case juries in late 1639, March 1640, mid-and-late 1642, and March 1643 court sessions. Most of the civil cases involved trespass, debts, or slander. He was also on grand juries in 1638, 1640, 1642, and 1643, which involved crimes of a misdemeanor or felony nature. 

In 1643, Able to Bear Arms (ATBA) List, Cooke and his sons Jacob and John (&quot;John Cooke, Jnr, his boy&quot;) are listed with those from Plymouth.

In 1651, Bradford recorded his impression of Cooke and his family in his later years: &quot;Francis Cooke is still living, a very old man, and hath seen his children&#x27;s children have children; after his wife came over, (with other of his children,) he hath 3 still living by her, all married, and have 5 children; so their increase is 8. And his son John, which came over with him, is married, and hath 4 children living.&quot;

On June 3, 1662, the General Court approved a list of thirty-three names &quot;as being the firstborn children of this government,&quot; to receive two tracts of land purchased from the Indians by the colony. The list was wider in scope than just being for &quot;firstborn&quot; settlers, as it named several of the original Mayflower passengers, including Cooke, but was presumably for their children.

<doc id="399155" wikidata="Q1034522" url="?curid=399155" title="Cape Wrath">
<text>Cape Wrath (, known as &quot; in Lewis) is a cape in the Durness parish of the county of Sutherland in the Highlands of Scotland. It is the most north-westerly point in Great Britain.

The cape is separated from the rest of the mainland by the Kyle of Durness and consists of of moorland wilderness known as the Parph. The first road was built in 1828 by the lighthouse commission across the Parph/Durness. This road connects a passenger ferry that crosses the Kyle of Durness with the buildings on the peninsula.

Much of the cape is owned by the Ministry of Defence and is used as a military training area, including as live firing range. Areas of it are also designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area, a Special Area of Conservation and a Special Landscape Area.

==Etymology==
The name Cape Wrath is derived from Old Norse &quot; (&quot;turning point&quot;), accordingly, &quot;wrath&quot; is pronounced (&quot;a&quot; as in &quot;cat&quot;), Vikings are believed to have used the cape as a navigation point where they would turn their ships.

== History==

Cape Wrath was once the home of a series of small crofting communities, although by 1845 the only families remaining on the Parph were those of shepherds. In the 1930s it supported a population of 30 to 40 people, including a small side school at Achiemore which had up to ten pupils in the 1930s but closed in 1947. Building remains at locations such as Kearvaig have been dated to the 18th century. The Cape has few archaeological remains which can be dated to earlier than this, although a promontory fort at Eilean nan Caorach to the east of the headland may date to the late prehistoric age.

Much of the area has been used for sheep grazing, a use which continues today, and shielings, shelters built for shepherds, can be found across the Cape. The area declined in population in the mid-20th century and is now almost entirely unpopulated, although military and tourism use continues. The Cape Wrath Lighthouse was built in 1828 and the access road from the Kyle of Durness dates from the same period. A Lloyd&#x27;s of London signal station was built close to the lighthouse at the end of the 19th century to track shipping around the Cape.

On 27 September 1915, while sailing for Scapa Flow, HMS &quot;Caribbean&quot;, known as before being requisitioned for wartime service, foundered off Cape Wrath in bad weather. A tow by HMS &quot;Birkenhead&quot; was unsuccessful, and 15 died. An inquiry later blamed the ship&#x27;s carpenter for being insufficiently familiar with the ship and for failing to shut all the scuttles. Like most of the crew, he had joined the ship just 10 days earlier. The wreck was found in 2004, off Cape Wrath, in of water and undisturbed except for fishing nets.

== Geography==

Cape Wrath is located in the traditional county of Sutherland within Highland Region. Durness is the closest village, southeast with Inverness around to the south.

The sea cliffs around the cape are composed of Torridonian sandstone and Lewisian gneiss. These rise to above sea level and include the highest sea cliffs on the British mainland at Clò Mòr around to the east of the headland. Sea stacks, such as Stac an Dùnain at the cape itself and Stac Clò Kearvaig to the east, rise out of the sea off the coastline, with Duslic, a reef, north of the cape. The cape is part of the North West Highlands Geopark, a area with UNESCO geopark status.

Crofting townships of two or three houses with associated enclosures existed at Daill, Achiemore, Kearvaig and Inshore into the mid-20th century. The land originally formed part of the Sutherland estates owned by the Duke of Sutherland. An area of , covering almost all of the northern part of the peninsula, is owned by the Ministry of Defence for use as a military training area.

===Climate===
As with the rest of the British Isles, Cape Wrath has an Oceanic (Köppen Cfb) climate. This is especially pronounced due to its western coastal location.

Its exposed northerly position can give rise to some exceptionally low winter sunshine levels: in January 1983 it recorded just 38 minutes of sunshine, a record low for Scotland. This exposed position, however, also means severe frost is rare compared to inland locations such as Altnaharra or Kinbrace. The record low of is comparable to those recorded in Shetland, the Hebrides and the Scilly Isles of England. A slight föhn effect can also occur with the right angle of southerly winds, exemplified by the record December high of .

Strong winds can be a feature of weather conditions at the cape, with gusts of recorded.
==Natural environment==
Because its landscape is largely untouched by man, Cape Wrath has a wide diversity of wildlife, including red deer, hooded crow, rock pipit, golden eagle, cormorant and gannet. An area of is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The cliffs around the cape are an internationally important nesting site for over 50000 seabirds, including colonies of puffin &quot;Fratercula arctica&quot;, razorbill &quot;Alca torda&quot;, guillemot &quot;Uria aalge&quot;, kittiwake &quot;Rissa tridactyla&quot; and fulmar &quot;Fulmarus glacialis&quot;. The SPA extends out to sea and includes the sea bed and marine environment which is a source of food for the bird population of the area.

Numbers of seabirds in the area saw significant declines in the early 21st century with puffin numbers falling by 50%. An area of is also designated as a Special Area of Conservation. Marine species present in the area include harbour porpoise, common seal and bottle-nosed dolphin as well as species such as sea squirts and sponges.

The cliff-top vegetation at sites such as Clò Mòr includes common scurvygrass &quot;Cochlearia officinalis&quot; and a wide range of habitats are present. These include cliff-top sand dunes at the cape itself as well as montane habitats found at sea level.

An area of around the coastline is designated as a Special Landscape Area. This area extends from Oldshoremore in the south-west to Durness in the east and includes the entire coastline of the cape area. Just offshore is Stac Clò Kearvaig, also known as &quot;The Cathedral&quot; due to the appearance of two spires and a natural window created by erosion. To the east lies Garvie Island (An Garbh-eilean), one of the main targets for live firing by the military.

Inland the landscape is primarily covered in peat and is often boggy with difficult terrain and a number of lochans, the largest of which, Loch Airigh na Beinne, is around in area. The area has been described as one of the few coastal wildernesses in Britain. Plant species include heather &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;, juniper &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; and ferns.

==Cape Wrath Lighthouse==

The lighthouse at Cape Wrath was built in 1828 by Robert Stevenson and was staffed until 1998, when it was converted to automatic operation by the Northern Lighthouse Board. The lighthouse, which is a Category A listed building, is a tall white-washed tower built of granite with a single storey semi-circular base building. The light, which is above sea level, is visible for .

A complex of buildings close to the lighthouse were built by Lloyd&#x27;s of London between 1894 and 1903 as a signal station to track shipping around the Cape. This closed in 1932, although the buildings were reused at the start of World War II as a coastguard station.

==Military use==
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) owns a area of the cape, known as the Cape Wrath Training Centre. The cape was used for training exercises from the early years of the 20th century, with the first by-laws established in 1933 to allow use of the area as a firing range. The area was used originally as a naval gunnery range and was bought by the MoD in 1999. Since 2005 the area has been used as a multi-services training area and is one of the sites used in the Joint Warrior exercises, Europe&#x27;s largest military exercise, and by other NATO operations. Training is allowed on up to 120 days a year, usually taking place in the spring and autumn, although times can be unpredictable. The range is usually open for public access during the summer period and there is rarely firing on Sundays.

The MoD owns a number of the surviving buildings in the area and operates observation posts and sentry posts during training. It is used for naval gunfire practice and for army artillery and mortar range firing. Disused military vehicles are often used as targets. The RAF uses An Garbh-eilean (Garvie Island) as a target for a range of training operations. It is the only place in the Northern Hemisphere where NATO forces combine land, air and sea capabilities in assault mode for training manoeuvres, deploying ordnance up to bombs. Firing on the range is controlled from Faraid Head close to Balnakeil.

In 2008 a heath fire was caused on the range during a period of live firing. An area of around was affected. Scottish Natural Heritage estimated that the area would take 10 years to return to its normal environmental conditions. Concern has also been raised of the effects of military exercises on nesting birds, on sheep during lambing season and the effects of noise on local residents. A shell fired during exercises caused concern in 2002 when it landed off-target near the mouth of Loch Eriboll and around from houses.

The MoD expressed an interest in extending its land holdings on the Cape in 2012 after being given the opportunity to purchase surrounding Cape Wrath Lighthouse by the Northern Lighthouse Board. The plans were opposed by the Durness Development Group which cited concerns that historic buildings might be destroyed and that visitors may be unable to access cliff top paths. The group registered an interest in the land using community right to buy legislation and a petition opposing the sale attracted thousands of signatures. In May 2013, the MoD announced that it would not be continuing with the purchase.

==Tourism==

The cape is visited by between 2,000 and 6,000 tourists a year, attracted by the lack of settlements, plants, animals, cliffs, mountain backdrop and lighthouse. The tourist industry is estimated to be worth between £400,000 and £620,000 to the economy of the local area around Durness.

The Cape is the northern trail head of two trails.
#The Cape Wrath Trail, through isolated country from Fort William
#The Scottish National Trail, from Kirk Yetholm on the Scottish border.

Cape Wrath is also the turning point for the Cape Wrath Marathon. It runs for to the lighthouse and the same distance back to the ferry dock on the Cape side. The final leg of the race is run from the mainland side from the ferry dock and finishes at Durness Community Centre. The marathon is held each year as the final event of a week of races, &quot;the Cape Wrath Challenge&quot;.

The sole inhabitants of the Cape are the Ure family, renting the main building. They converted it into a three-bedroomed home, and opened what is claimed to be Britain&#x27;s most remote cafe, the Ozone Cafe, in 2009. The cafe was opened by the Princess Royal, and seats eight people.

The Durness Development Group has made proposals, assisted by the Highlands and Islands Social Enterprise Zone, to develop Cape Wrath as a visitor location. These may see the number of visitors rise to 10,000 and facilities at the Cape developed.

== Transport ==

From the south, the only route to the Cape is on foot from Sandwood Bay and Kinlochbervie. Access is restricted at times by military operations on the Cape.

A rough road of around links the lighthouse with the Kyle of Durness which is crossed by a passenger ferry service operating between May and September. The road was built as part of the lighthouse construction in 1828 and, in places, uses a series of rock causeways to cross peat bogs and revetments to maintain a route along steep slopes. Materials for the road were quarried locally and there are a number of quarrying sites along it. The road is marked with milestones and crosses the Allt na Guaille and Kearvaig River on contemporary arched bridges. The original slipway on the Kyle of Durness was built north of Daill with an associated storehouse similar to that at Clais Charnach. This was linked by a rough track with the road being extended south the slipway at Ferry House during the 1830s.

The road, the U70, passes the hamlet of Achiemore where a Ministry of Defence check-point blocks access to the cape during live firing exercises. It passes the farmsteads of Daill and Inshore, where the MoD uses the remaining house, before a track to the right links the road to the old hamlet of Kearvaig, where there is a beach and Kearvaig House which the Mountain Bothies Association have converted into a bothy. Margaret Davies, a walker, was found there dying of starvation in 2002. A minibus service operates along the road during the summer period linking the ferry slipway with the lighthouse. The road, ferry and minibus service are suspended during military training operations on the cape.

<text>Lea Katherine Thompson (born May 31, 1961) is an American actress, singer, dancer, and director.

She is best known for her roles as Lorraine Baines-McFly in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film trilogy (1985–1990), Beverly Switzler in &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (1986), and Amanda Jones in &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; (1987). Other films for which she is known include &quot;All the Right Moves&quot; (1983), &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1993). In the 1990s, she played the title character Caroline Duffy in the sitcom &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;. From 2011 to 2017, she co-starred as Kathryn Kennish in the ABC Family-turned-Freeform series &quot;Switched at Birth&quot;.

== Early life ==
Lea Thompson was born on May 31, 1961, in Rochester, Minnesota, one of five children of Clifford and Barbara Barry Thompson, a musician. She has two sisters, Coleen Goodrich and Shannon Katona, and two brothers, Andrew and Barry. Thompson is of Irish, English, Scots-Irish, German, and distant Dutch ancestry

She studied ballet as a child (as did her older brother Andrew) and was dancing professionally by age 14, winning scholarships to the San Francisco Ballet, the Pennsylvania Ballet, and the American Ballet Theatre.

At 20, Thompson was dancing with American Ballet Theatre&#x27;s Studio Company, then known as ABT II. Mikhail Baryshnikov, who was the artistic director at the time, told her, &quot;You&#x27;re a lovely dancer, but you&#x27;re too stocky.&quot; She said it was &quot;my epiphany when I decided to stop dancing and not be a ballet dancer. It was a wonderful moment because I could&#x27;ve been banging my head against the wall for another 10 years.&quot; She left ballet, but her older brother continued and went on to have a long career in the field.

Thompson changed her focus to acting and moved to New York at age 20. She appeared in a number of Burger King advertisements in the 1980s with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Elisabeth Shue, her later co-star in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;.

==Career==
In 1982, Thompson played Cecily &quot;Sissy&quot; Loper in the interactive live-action video game &quot;MysteryDisc: Murder, Anyone?&quot;. She made her movie debut in 1983 with &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;. Thompson recalled the film as &quot;the very first movie I ever got, but I lied and said I had done a couple of other movies, so when I showed up, I really knew absolutely nothing. Also, I had said that I knew how to water ski. And I did not. So I had, like, five days to learn really, really complicated water-skiing things, because I had to fit into the Sea World water-skiing show. I don&#x27;t even know how to swim!&quot; She followed this with &quot;All the Right Moves&quot; (1983), &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Wild Life&quot; (1984).

Thompson&#x27;s most famous role is that of Lorraine Baines McFly in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, with the first film released in 1985. Thompson&#x27;s character is the mother of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), whom Marty meets when she is a 1950s teenager after he travels back in time. He has to avoid letting Lorraine fall in love with him instead of with his future father, George McFly (Crispin Glover), leading to awkward scenes in which Lorraine is attracted to Marty.

In 1986, Thompson starred in &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; and &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;. For the latter film, she sang several songs on the soundtrack in character, as musician Beverly Switzler, who was the lead vocalist for a band called Cherry Bomb. The recordings appeared on the soundtrack album and on singles. Rounding out film appearances in the late 1980s, Thompson starred in &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Casual Sex?&quot;, and &quot;The Wizard of Loneliness&quot;. She also had a prominent role in the 1989 TV film &quot;Nightbreaker&quot;, for which she was nominated for a CableACE Award. In the early 1990s, Thompson starred as Alice Mitchell, the mother of the eponymous character Dennis Mitchell (Mason Gamble) in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993), the villainess Laura Jackson in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1993), and Ms. Roberts, a snooty ballet instructor in &quot;The Little Rascals&quot; (1994). She also appeared in several TV films throughout the 1990s, including &quot;The Substitute Wife&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Right to Remain Silent&quot; (1996).

Thompson found moderate critical and popular success as the star of the NBC sitcom &quot;Caroline in the City&quot; from 1995 to 1999. In 1996, Thompson received a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Female Performer in a New TV Series, while her show won for Favorite New TV Comedy Series at the 22nd People&#x27;s Choice Awards. Thompson also starred in &quot;A Will of Their Own&quot;, a 1998 American television mini-series directed by Karen Arthur. The film follows six generations of females within one family, and their struggle for power and independence in America. The film debuted on October 18, 1998, on NBC to strong critical reviews.

After a break from acting, Thompson went on to star in several Broadway plays. She later appeared in a TV series called &quot;For the People&quot;, which only lasted one season. She then starred in a TV film, &quot;Stealing Christmas&quot; (2003), starring Tony Danza and Betty White. Thompson also appeared in several episodes of the dramedy series &quot;Ed&quot; and in a guest role for one episode in 2004 on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;; she played Michelle Osborne, a woman whose embryos were stolen.
In 2005, Thompson began a series of made-for-TV films for the Hallmark Channel, &quot;Jane Doe&quot;, in which she played Cathy Davis, an ex-secret agent turned housewife, who helps the government solve mysteries. Thompson directed two films from the &quot;Jane Doe&quot; series – &quot;Jane Doe: The Harder They Fall&quot; and &quot;Jane Doe: Eye of the Beholder&quot;.

Thompson was a featured singer on &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot; and the second contestant eliminated in 2006. In April 2007, she starred in another television film, &quot;A Life Interrupted&quot;, which premiered on Lifetime.

Thompson guest-starred on the show &quot;Head Case&quot; in January 2008. She appeared in the TV film &quot;Final Approach&quot;, which debuted in the U.S. on May 24, 2008. Her film credits include &quot;Exit Speed&quot;, &quot;Spy School&quot;, &quot;Splinterheads&quot;, and &quot;Adventures of a Teenage Dragon Slayer&quot;. She starred in the television movie &quot;The Christmas Clause&quot;, which received good reviews and ratings.

Thompson starred in &quot;Mystery Case Files: Shadow Lake&quot;, an adventure game released in November 2012 by Big Fish Games. In the game, Thompson&#x27;s daughter Madelyn Deutch played Kelli, a paranormal television-series host.

From 2011 to 2017, Thompson starred in the ABC Family series &quot;Switched at Birth&quot;, about a family realizing their 16-year-old daughter Bay Kennish (Vanessa Marano) is not biologically theirs and was switched with another baby Daphne Vasquez (Katie Leclerc) at the hospital.

In 2014, Thompson was a competitor on the 19th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was paired with professional dancer Artem Chigvintsev. The couple was eliminated in the quarterfinals, finishing sixth place. She also played Irene Steele in the film &quot;Left Behind&quot;.

On April 27, 2017, Thompson was cast in the film &quot;Little Women&quot;, the seventh adaptation of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s novel of the same name, written and directed by first-time director Clare Niederpruem. Thompson portrayed Margaret &quot;Marmee&quot; March, the mother who helps her daughters navigate the struggles and heartbreaks of adolescence and adulthood. The film was released on September 28, 2018, to coincide with the book&#x27;s 150th-anniversary publishing date.

She directed &quot;Family Day&quot;, episode 5 of season 2 of the Syfy series &quot;Resident Alien&quot;, first aired in February 2022.

She directed &quot;Assimilation&quot; and &quot;Watcher&quot; episodes 3 and 4 and had a cameo role as Dr. Diane Werner in &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, episode 5 of season 2 of the Paramount+ series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, which aired in March 2022.

== Personal life ==
Thompson was engaged to Dennis Quaid from 1984 to 1987. She met film director Howard Deutch on the set of &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; in 1987 and they were married in 1989.

<text>Summerside is a Canadian city in Prince County, Prince Edward Island. It is the second largest city in the province and the primary service centre for the western part of the island.

== History ==
Summerside was officially incorporated as a town on April 1, 1877. On April 1, 1995, the Town of Summerside amalgamated with the incorporated communities of St. Eleanors and Wilmot. At the same time, the amalgamated Summerside annexed portions of the Community of Sherbrooke and the Lot 17 township. It was PEI&#x27;s second incorporated city, after the provincial capital of Charlottetown.

Summerside is named for an inn owned by George Linkletter II, called Summer Side House.

== Economy ==
The largest single employer within the city is the Summerside Tax Centre, a Government of Canada agency which principally processes the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

The Slemon Park business park (formerly a military airbase, CFB Summerside) hosts a concentration of several aerospace and transportation companies in former military buildings; StandardAero (formerly Vector Aerospace/Atlantic Turbines) repairs and overhauls Gas Turbine aircraft engines, Testori Americas produces interiors for aircraft and mass transit surface vehicles, and Honeywell manufactures and repairs parts for aircraft.

Amalgamated Dairies Limited is based in Summerside, founded in 1953 by six dairies as a co-operative and owned by dairy producers.

The outlying community of New Annan is home to the operations of Cavendish Farms, Prince Edward Island&#x27;s largest private sector employer. Cavendish Farms maintains two large frozen foods processing plants in New Annan. Other outlying communities, such as Borden-Carleton have important employers for Summerside residents.

Since the closure of CFB Summerside in 1990, the city has been aggressive in courting new business opportunities and has created an Economic Development Office for the purpose of encouraging investment in the city. CFB Summerside is now the location of the Summerside Airport.

The Summerside area was at one time home to the world&#x27;s largest concentration of Tame Silver Fox farms. This is highlighted at the PEI Fox Museum in the Summerside Armoury, a heritage building acquired by the City of Summerside in 1996.

== Government ==
The Summerside City Council is governed by a mayor and eight councillors who represent geographic areas called wards. The current mayor is Dan Kutcher.

The Summerside Police Department is responsible for law enforcement within the city. The East Prince Detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is located in North Bedeque, southeast of the city, however its only responsibility is to patrol, with the Summerside Police Department, the provincial Route 1A and Route 2 highways which pass along the east and north sides of the city.

== Politics ==
For elections to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island, Summerside is covered by Summerside-Wilmot and Summerside-South Drive.

For elections to the House of Commons of Canada, Summerside is covered by Egmont.

==Education==
Summerside has seven English public schools: four elementary, two junior high, and one senior high school. The English Language School Board has an office in the city.

The city also has one French public school operated by the Commission scolaire de langue française.

Holland College, Prince Edward Island&#x27;s community college system, maintains three facilities in Summerside;

* Summerside Waterfront Campus
* Marine Training Centre
* Atlantic Police Academy

The College of Piping and Celtic Performing Arts of Canada is also located in Summerside.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Summerside had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Energy ==

The City of Summerside operates the only municipally-owned electric utility in Prince Edward Island. After buying Charlottetown Light &amp; Power in 1918, Maritime Electric consolidated electric distribution on the island. The company offered to take over the operations in Summerside, but backed down after citizens rejected various offers. The Summerside distribution grid has had an inter-connection with the Maritime Electric transmission grid since 1961.

Similar to Maritime Electric, Summerside Electric purchases the majority of its electricity from NB Power. In 2008, 76.5% of its power was acquired from NB Power. Although the Summerside Electric Commission has its own diesel engines at the Harvard Street Generating Station which can operate for several days independently of NB Power&#x27;s supply, it is only used in exceptional circumstances such as when the NB Power or Maritime Electric transmission grids that feed the city are interrupted. They also run their engines on the last day of every month, for maintenance reasons and they sell that power back to NB Power.

In 2007 the city signed a 20-year agreement with a private wind energy company to supply about 23% of its electricity from a private wind farm in West Cape.

Construction started on a city owned wind farm in 2009 comprising four wind turbines, each capable of producing 3 megawatts of electricity. The wind farm became fully operational in late 2009 and was immediately tied into the city&#x27;s power. This is Canada&#x27;s first municipally owned and operated wind farm. On an average day the wind farm produces about 25% of the electricity for the entire city. At times when electricity usage in the city is low and the winds are high the wind farm has potential to produce more power than the city consumes.

The city is a supporter of clean electric vehicles. As of September 2013 there are over 10 electric car charging stations in the city with another 30 to be installed in the coming months. There are more charging stations per capita in Summerside than any other city in Canada.

== Medical services ==

The Prince County Hospital, located in the city&#x27;s north end, is the main referral hospital in the western part of the province.
Island Emergency Medical Services operates two Advanced Life Support Paramedic Ambulances 24/7 from its base downtown.

==Climate==
Summerside has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm but somewhat moderate summers. It has cold winters with heavy snowfall, with some maritime moderation compared to areas farther inland.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Summerside was on 15 July 2013. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 12 January 1930.
==Attractions==

The Summerside Raceway is a standardbred harness racing track which is believed to be the oldest operating racing track in Canada, having opened in 1886. It is adjacent to Credit Union Place, the largest indoor sports facility in the province with a large hockey arena seating 4000, a bowling alley, a 25-metre swimming pool and other fitness and meeting facilities. Other attractions include the Harbourfront Theatre, the College of Piping and Celtic Performing Arts the Silver Fox Curling &amp; Yacht Club, the Summerside Golf &amp; Country Club, the PEI Sports Hall of Fame and Spinnakers&#x27; Landing.

The city has redeveloped several waterfront industrial sites, abandoned by the railway and marine terminal during the 1990s, into new parkland. A major reconstruction of the west end seawall has resulted in a new waterfront boardwalk for residents and visitors.

The former post office on Summer Street was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1983. The former railway station, designed by architect Charles Benjamin Chappell and built in 1927, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2007.

The fish industry has also thrived recently and created a whole new division of tourism industry. According to 2016 demographics of the city, most of the tourism in recent years, is from families just wanting to go sail out on the ocean, and catch some fish to sell to a market, or bring home.

* U-18 Men&#x27;s Softball World Cup (1989 and 2005)

<text>William Monroe Trotter, sometimes just Monroe Trotter (April 7, 1872 – April 7, 1934), was a newspaper editor and real estate businessman based in Boston, Massachusetts. An activist for African-American civil rights, he was an early opponent of the accommodationist race policies of Booker T. Washington, and in 1901 founded the &quot;Boston Guardian,&quot; an independent African-American newspaper he used to express that opposition. Active in protest movements for civil rights throughout the 1900s and 1910s, he also revealed some of the differences within the African-American community. He contributed to the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Trotter was born into a well-to-do family and raised in Hyde Park, Massachusetts. J. M. Trotter, a Recorder of Deeds, and Virginia Trotter were his parents. He earned his graduate and post-graduate degrees at Harvard University, and was the first man of color to earn a Phi Beta Kappa key there. Seeing an increase in segregation in northern facilities, he began to engage in a life of activism, to which he devoted his assets. He joined with W. E. B. Du Bois in founding the Niagara Movement in 1905, a forerunner of the NAACP. Trotter&#x27;s style was often divisive, and he ended up leaving that organization for the National Equal Rights League. His protest activities were sometimes seen to be at cross purposes to those of the NAACP.

In 1914, he had a highly publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, in which he protested Wilson&#x27;s introduction of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in shutting down productions of &quot;The Clansman&quot; in 1910, but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, which also portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in favorable terms. He was not able to influence the peace talks at the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In 1921, in an alliance with Roman Catholics, he got a revival screening of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; banned. He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home.

==Early life and education==
William was the third child, and first to survive infancy, of James Monroe Trotter and Virginia (Isaacs) Trotter. His father James was born into slavery in Mississippi; James&#x27; mother Letitia was enslaved, and his father was her white master Richard S. Trotter. Letitia, her son and two daughters were freed by their master after his marriage and sent to Cincinnati, Ohio, which had a thriving free black community. After working as a teacher, James Trotter enlisted in the United States Colored Troops during the American Civil War, and was the first man of color to be promoted to lieutenant in the 55th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry (Colored).
Virginia Isaacs, also of mixed race, was born free in 1842 in either Ohio or Virginia. Her mother Ann-Elizabeth Fossett was born into slavery at Monticello, where she was a daughter of Joseph Fossett and Edith Hern Fossett, and great granddaughter of Elizabeth Hemings. Virginia&#x27;s father Tucker Isaacs was a free person of color. He purchased the freedom of Ann-Elizabeth Fossett, Virginia&#x27;s mother. The family moved to Chillicothe in the free state of Ohio, where Virginia grew up in its thriving black community. There she met and married James Trotter.

Shortly after the Civil War, the Trotters moved from Ohio to settle in Boston, Massachusetts. After their first two children died in infancy, they returned to the Isaacs farm of Virginia&#x27;s parents, where their son William Monroe Trotter was born on April 7, 1872. When he was seven months old, the family moved back to Boston, where they settled in the South End, far from the predominantly African-American west side of Beacon Hill. The family later moved to suburban Hyde Park, a white neighborhood. The Trotters had two more children, both daughters.
Trotter&#x27;s father broke through many racial obstacles placed before him, but was often frustrated in his attempts to gain equal treatment or fair consideration. While serving in the Union Army, he protested the inequality of pay between blacks and whites. In Boston he was the first man of color to be employed by the Post Office Department (now the U.S. Postal Service), a job he left after he was repeatedly passed over for promotion because of discriminatory Republican-led federal government policy. Politically active, the elder Trotter was a leading African-American Democrat in New England. He supported Grover Cleveland for President, and was rewarded in 1886 when Cleveland appointed him Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia, the highest federal position filled by black men at the time. Two other prominent men of color of that era, Frederick Douglass and Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce, also held the post. The job was a lucrative one, and the Trotter family prospered.

The young Trotter (who was usually called by his middle name &quot;Monroe&quot;) grew up in this environment, and was introduced to Archibald Grimké, another politically active African American who also lived in Hyde Park. He excelled in school, graduating from the otherwise all-white Hyde Park High School as valedictorian and president of his high school class. He went on to Harvard University, where he continued to distinguish himself academically. He was awarded merit scholarships after his father died, and was the first man of color to be awarded a Phi Beta Kappa key at Harvard. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1895 and a Masters in 1896, working a variety of odd jobs to help pay his tuition.

During his years at Harvard, he adopted a number of habits which he maintained for much of his life. He organized and led the Total Abstinence League, a temperance organization; he was a teetotaler and never drank alcohol. He was active in the Baptist church, in which he had considered becoming a minister.

==Marriage and family==
Following his graduation, Trotter participated in the upper echelons of Negro society in Boston, a number of whose members had ancestors free before the Civil War. He belonged to an exclusive literary society that met at the home of Cambridge educator Maria Baldwin. On June 27, 1899, Trotter married Geraldine Louise (&quot;Deenie&quot;) Pindell (October 3, 1872 – October 8, 1918), who was from another activist family. He had known her since childhood. She assisted him throughout his career until her death in the 1918 flu pandemic. The couple had no children.

==Early career==
Trotter&#x27;s career began inauspiciously. His initial attempts to get jobs at established banking and real estate firms were unsuccessful, leading him through a succession of lower-paying clerking jobs. He finally landed a job in a white-owned real estate firm in 1898, but decided the next year to open his own business selling insurance and brokering mortgages. He was not particularly active in agitating for civil rights in these years, although his strong opinions on racial equality were evident in an 1899 paper in which he called on African Americans to seek admission to institutions of higher learning. (It was a common practice of the time to direct African Americans away from higher education opportunities and into industrial training programs.) Trotter&#x27;s business was relatively successful, and he was able to purchase investment properties.

Trotter was increasingly troubled by what he saw as the accommodationist policies of Booker T. Washington, one of the leading African-American figures of the 1890s and founder of the Tuskegee Institute. Washington&#x27;s policies were enshrined in the Atlanta Compromise, outlined in an 1895 speech he gave in Atlanta, Georgia. He said that Southern African Americans should not agitate for political rights (such as the right to vote and equal treatment under the law) as long as they were provided economic opportunities and basic rights of due process. Washington actively promoted the idea that African Americans, once they had proven themselves as productive members of society, would be granted full political rights. Trotter, Grimké, W. E. B. Du Bois, and other northern radicals disagreed with these ideas, arguing that it was necessary for African Americans to agitate for equal treatment and full constitutional rights, because doing so would bring other benefits. By the turn of the century, African Americans in the South had been effectively disfranchised by violence around elections, and restrictions in voting registration rules, and, finally, constitutional amendments or new constitutions in Southern states.

Although Boston was comparatively congenial when compared to other parts of the country, Trotter and others felt that Washington&#x27;s stance was leading to an increase in more typically Southern racist attitudes in the city. &quot;The conviction grew upon me&quot;, he wrote, that his business successes could be endangered &quot;if race prejudice and persecution and public discrimination from mere color was to spread up from the South and result in a fixed caste of color&quot;.

==The &quot;Guardian&quot;==

Trotter&#x27;s racial activism blossomed in 1901. He helped found the Boston Literary and Historical Association, which became, according to biographer Stephen Fox, &quot;a forum for militant race opinion&quot;. He also joined the Massachusetts Racial Protective Association, another local group that promoted political goals of equality. Under the aegis of the latter group, Trotter in October 1901 gave his first major protest speech, attacking Washington&#x27;s accommodationist stance: &quot;In Boston [Washington] said that the Negro should wait for the franchise until he had got property, education and character. Washington&#x27;s attitude has ever been one of servility.&quot;

With George W. Forbes, another Protective Association member, in 1901 Trotter co-founded the &quot;Guardian&quot;, a weekly newspaper. At first Forbes, an Amherst College graduate with some experience in publishing, was the driving operational force in its production, while Trotter funded the effort and served as its managing editor. The paper became a forum for a more outspoken and forceful approach to gaining racial equality, and its contributors and editorials (which were generally written by Trotter) regularly attacked Washington. The paper&#x27;s editorial stance brought a stream of criticism from more mainstream African-American publications: the &quot;New York Age&quot;, calling it &quot;putrescent&quot;, wrote that &quot;Editor Trotter ... makes himself smelt if not felt&quot;; another wrote that the &quot;Guardian&quot; was &quot;carrying its cases too fast and too far&quot;, and that Trotter suffered from a &quot;mental malady&quot;. The &quot;Guardian&quot; had limited circulation, but was highly influential as one of only 200 African-American publications in the country. It suffered financially due to Trotter&#x27;s poor accounting and inattention due to his heavy schedule. Forbes, who principally worked as a librarian in the city library, left the business in 1904 because of Booker T. Washington&#x27;s legal assaults on the newspaper and pressure by Washington supporters on his employers. Trotter&#x27;s wife, and later his sister, assisted in the paper&#x27;s publication.

Trotter, in a deliberate move, transferred the &quot;Guardian&quot; offices in 1907 to the same building that had once housed William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s &quot;Liberator&quot;. Trotter idolized Garrison, a leading abolitionist agitator before the Civil War, and had studied his methods. He was a regular correspondent with Garrison&#x27;s sons William Jr. and Francis Garrison.

The &quot;Guardian&quot; was always unprofitable, a condition that was exacerbated by Trotter&#x27;s refusal to take advertising for alcohol and tobacco. He sold off all of his Boston-area properties by 1910 to raise funds for the newspaper, and he was lax in collecting payments from his subscribers. In his later years, the quality of the publication noticeably declined, and its operations were propped up by a local community group&#x27;s fund-raising activities.
==Attacking the African-American establishment==

In the early 1900s Trotter noticed that racial segregation was spreading in Boston: the number of hotels, restaurants, and other public establishments refusing service to African Americans was increasing. He came to realize that, in order to effect real change, the radical message needed to be taken out of Boston, and began organizing protest meetings across New England in 1903. At the suggestion of Trotter, William H. Ferris went to Washington D.C. in January 1903. Ferris gave a presentation critical to Booker T. Washington in front of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society on January 6, 1903. Richard W. Thompson spoke in support of Washington as replies at the Second Baptist Lyceum on January 25 and Jesse Lawson did the same on February 3. In 1999, Jacqueline M. Moore argued that Thompson&#x27;s paper failed to hold his ground against Ferris, who was present at the talk.

His long-term objective was to effect policy changes in the National Afro-American Council, then the only national-level organization of African Americans. At the group&#x27;s annual meeting in Louisville, Kentucky, Trotter and others introduced resolutions calling for more activism, but Booker T. Washington supporters (also known as &quot;Bookerites&quot;), who controlled the council, saw to their defeat. One commentator wrote that the &quot;Boston idiots&quot; had been treated &quot;in delightful fashion&quot;. The &quot;Guardian&quot; described the convention as &quot;dominated to death by one man&quot;. The activities of the radicals at the convention did bring them some national press. Trotter continued to criticize Washington in the &quot;Guardian&quot;; his attacks were particularly harsh and personal, and brought a bitter tinge to the disagreement.

In this period, while the Great Migration of African Americans out of the South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with different conditions. The vast majority of the millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.

Following their failure to advance the radical agenda in Louisville, Trotter and the other radicals sought a more sympathetic forum in which to attack Booker T. Washington. An opportunity arrived when Washington was set to speak in Boston in July 1903. When the Tuskegee Institute leader was introduced to a visibly hostile crowd, a small riot broke out. Trotter, who had arrived prepared with several provocative questions to ask Washington, attempted to read them over the din of the melee. He was among the arrested, and the &quot;Boston riot&quot; received national press coverage. Trotter later claimed that there was no plan to break up the meeting. Bookerites pressed charges against Trotter for disrupting the meeting; defended by Archibald Grimké, Trotter was convicted and spent thirty days in the Charles Street Jail. Although the Bookerites had hoped to discredit the radicals with the trial, they gained them wider publicity. After the trial, Trotter founded the Boston Suffrage League (1903), and when a New England Suffrage League was founded in 1904, Trotter was elected president.

Washington countered Trotter&#x27;s attacks with a variety of tactics. He took various legal actions against Trotter, including at least one libel suit and criminal charges. In addition, he used his network to apply pressure to Trotter&#x27;s supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others. Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter&#x27;s radical voice. As a result of such activities, Trotter&#x27;s printer dropped the activist and his newspaper as a client. But Trotter found another printer and continued publishing the &quot;Guardian&quot; despite the setback.

==Niagara Movement and the NAACP==
In the early months of 1905, Booker T. Washington sought to create an umbrella organization to represent all the major African-American leaders of the day. Du Bois and Grimké were the two most radical leaders invited to its early organizational meetings, but both eventually refused to ally with Washington, whom they saw as dominating the group. Du Bois, Trotter, and two others organized a meeting of radicals from across the nation in western New York. Meeting in July just across the Canada–US border in Fort Erie, Ontario they founded the Niagara Movement. Organized so that no one man could dominate it, the group espoused a radical declaration of principles (authored by Trotter and Du Bois), calling for agitation for equal economic opportunity and exercise of full civil rights for African Americans. The organization was soon divided internally by political and personal disagreements, and Washington worked from outside against its growth.
During the early months of 1906, friction began to develop between Du Bois and Trotter over the admission of women to the organization. Du Bois supported the idea, and Trotter opposed it, but eventually relented. The matter was smoothed over during the 1906 meeting. Their division became more significant when Trotter split with Clement Morgan, a longtime supporter and Movement member, over Massachusetts politics and control of the local Movement chapter. Du Bois sided with Morgan and, when the Movement met in Boston in 1907, he reappointed Morgan to a leading position in the organization. Attempts to heal the rift failed, and Trotter resigned from the Movement. Because of these difficulties, the organization had effectively collapsed by 1908. The break between Trotter and Du Bois was permanent, and they never worked directly together again. Du Bois wrote in 1909 that it was &quot;utterly impossible to work with Mr. Trotter.&quot;

Despite the Niagara Movement&#x27;s failure, its goals had appealed to white supporters of racial equality. They participated in the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which drew an inter-racial coalition of support. Trotter and Du Bois were both present at meetings in 1909 in which its foundation was laid. Although some of Trotter&#x27;s proposals were accepted (to address segregated transportation as a grievance), others were not (such as his proposal for a bill to make lynching a federal crime). Trotter was not invited to be on the organization&#x27;s executive committee; neither was Booker T. Washington, who boycotted the effort.

Trotter never played a significant role in the NAACP, and in its early years actively competed with it. In 1911 Trotter&#x27;s group and the NAACP both held rallies in Boston to mark the centennial of abolitionist Charles Sumner&#x27;s birth. Trotter was peripherally involved with the NAACP for a few years, but he did not approve of the amount of white involvement in the interracial group. His feud with Du Bois ran deep, so he rarely contributed to the organization at the national level. He was also troubled by the attitudes expressed in the Boston chapter, which he told NAACP leader Joel Spingarn needed more &quot;radical, courageous activity.&quot; He eventually drifted away from the NAACP.

== National Independent Political League ==
After Trotter split from the Niagara Movement, he helped organize a conference of like-minded activists held in Philadelphia in April 1908, and served as the conference chair. In this capacity, he excluded any attendees whose racial ideology he opposed, as well as those who supported Republican William Howard Taft in the upcoming presidential election. (Trotter opposed Taft because he had tired of what he considered the Republican Party &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policies on race.) This conference led to the formation of the Negro American Political League, which eventually became known as the National Independent Political League (NIPL) and National Equal Rights League (NERL). Trotter described this group as &quot;of the colored people and for the colored people and led by the colored people.&quot;
NIPL, which biographer Fox describes as Trotter&#x27;s &quot;personal fief&quot;, was unable to attract high-profile membership as the NAACP did. Trotter did not want white members, and was unable to work effectively with other African-American leaders. NIPL and the NAACP, while both working toward similar goals, regularly feuded over matters public and personal.

As the NAACP attracted more money and talent, and became the center of anti-Bookerite civil rights activity, Trotter and the NIPL became increasingly marginalized on the left. Trotter would not have as prominent a role in the civil rights dialogue again. By 1921 the league had been reduced to a handful of Trotter supporters.

==Trotter and Woodrow Wilson==
Trotter&#x27;s opposition to Booker T. Washington placed him at odds with Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, Republican presidents who relied on Washington as an adviser and otherwise enjoyed widespread African-American support. Trotter supported the Southern Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 election. Wilson, in a brief meeting with Trotter and other NERL members, made vague statements about fair treatment of African Americans. But, he succumbed to pressure from Southerners in his cabinet and agreed to segregate federal offices. The NAACP and NERL (then known as the National Independent Political League, or NIPL) protested, and Trotter secured a meeting with Wilson at the White House in November 1913. Wilson said that his policies were not segregationist, but Trotter characterized Wilson&#x27;s denial as &quot;preposterous&quot;.

Trotter continued his protests, eventually gaining a second invitation to the White House in November 1914. This meeting with Wilson ended with a heated exchange between the two men. Wilson claimed to be dealing with a &quot;human problem&quot; from which politics should be left out, and suggested to Trotter&#x27;s group that they could always vote for someone else in the next election. Trotter continued to argue that the segregationist policy was humiliating to African Americans. Wilson responded, &quot;If you take it as a humiliation, which it is not intended as, and sow the seed of that impression all over the country, why the consequences will be very serious.&quot; After Trotter said this was an insult, Wilson angrily ordered him to leave, saying &quot;If this organization wishes to approach me again, it must choose another spokesman ... your tone, sir, offends me.&quot;

Trotter&#x27;s second meeting with the President was widely covered in the press, featured on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other leading newspapers. A white Texas newspaper described Trotter as &quot;merely a nigger&quot; and &quot;not a Booker T. Washington type of colored man&quot;, and Northern papers also criticized him for his &quot;insolence&quot; to the president. The &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, while observing that Wilson&#x27;s policy was segregationist and divisive, pointed out that although Trotter was basically correct, he &quot;offends many of his own color by his ... untactful belligerency&quot;. African Americans were divided in their response to the incident: some claimed that he did not represent them, while others, notably Du Bois, grudgingly admired Trotter&#x27;s audacity. Du Bois wrote that Wilson was &quot;insulting &amp; condescending&quot; in the meeting. Trotter parlayed the publicity into a series of speaking engagements, in which he denied &quot;that in language, manner, tone, in any respect or to the slightest degree I was impudent, insolent, or insulting to the President.&quot;
Trotter continued to protest segregationist policies of the Wilson administration. When the country began large-scale recruiting for the military in World War I, Trotter opposed the establishment of segregated officer training facilities. Through his influence, recruitment of blacks in the Boston area was lower than expected. During World War II, the military integrated the officer corps, and President Harry Truman afterward completed integration of the armed services.

When the Great War ended, Trotter sought to use the 1919 Paris Peace Conference as a vehicle to raise international awareness of US government policy toward African Americans. He viewed the reality of segregation as incompatible with Wilson&#x27;s war vision to &quot;make the world safe for Democracy.&quot; Trotter organized a meeting in Washington, DC related to the peace conference; he and ten other African-American delegates were chosen to attend the peace conference. The State Department refused to issue passports to those delegates, or to African Americans planning to attend a Pan-African Congress that Du Bois was organizing to be held concurrently with the peace conference in Paris. Du Bois and other African Americans were supporting African colonies&#x27; desire for independence.

To get to Europe, Trotter posed as a seaman seeking work in New York, and got a job as a cook on the SS &quot;Yarmouth&quot; to gain passage to France. He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook&#x27;s clothing, only to find that the principal peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did not include any statement of racial equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States, but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference. He also missed Du Bois&#x27; Pan-African Congress, which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.

Trotter returned to the United States in July 1919 to learn of ongoing race riots at major cities across the country. Postwar economic and social tensions had erupted, and blacks fought back against white violence in cities such as Chicago and Omaha. Trotter quickly supported active resistance to white-on-black violence, writing, &quot;Unless the white American behaves, he will find that in teaching our boys to fight for him he was starting something that he will not be able to stop.&quot; His writings prompted calls in Congress for the censorship of the Negro press: South Carolina Congressman James F. Byrnes accused Trotter of &quot;doing his utmost to incite riots and bloodshed.&quot; Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge gave Trotter a chance to testify during Senate deliberations on ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, which Lodge opposed on grounds other than Trotter&#x27;s. Lodge&#x27;s opposition was successful: the Senate never ratified the treaty.

==Other protests and later years==

Trotter mounted a campaign against Thomas Dixon&#x27;s play &quot;The Clansman&quot; when it opened in Boston in 1910; the play portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in heroic terms during Reconstruction. His protests succeeded in closing the production. While on his speaking tour in early 1915, he learned that D. W. Griffith&#x27;s movie, &quot;The Birth of a Nation,&quot; adapted from &quot;The Clansman&quot;, would be opening in Boston. He rushed back to lead protests against the film. In April, the Tremont Theatre denied Trotter and a group of African Americans tickets to the showing. When they refused to leave the lobby, plainclothes police moved in, sparking a scuffle. Trotter and ten others were arrested; other protests took place both inside and outside the theater. Trotter, united with other factions of the African-American community, tried but could not get the film banned in Boston. This united front, along with the death later in 1915 of Booker T. Washington, reduced for a time the internal hostilities in the Boston African-American community.

The KKK had a revival for a decade after 1915, especially in industrial cities and the Midwest. In 1921, Trotter was successful in shutting down new screenings of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; in Boston; he allied with Roman Catholic organizations, who objected to the KKK&#x27;s anti-Catholic stance of the 20th century, and were strong in the city as a result of extensive Irish and Italian immigration.

Trotter&#x27;s wife had died in the 1918 influenza pandemic. She had been a partner in all his activities and he missed her greatly.
Through the 1920s and 1930s, Trotter subsided into a genteel poverty, using the &quot;Guardian&quot; as an ongoing voice of protest. He lobbied for anti-lynching bills in Congress, with limited success. Even when the House overwhelmingly passed such a bill in 1922, the Southern bloc in the Senate filibustered and effectively killed passage of the bill for three years running. (White Democrats effectively controlled nearly all the Congressional seats apportioned to the total population of the South, after having disfranchised blacks.) They controlled chairmanships of numerous important committees, which were established by seniority.

In 1923 Trotter eventually came to an uneasy truce with the NAACP. His attempts to promote his style of activism, however, were eclipsed by activities of younger leaders, such as Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican immigrant in New York City and leader of the UNIA.

Through these years, Trotter routinely wrote in the &quot;Guardian&quot; about incidents of racial injustice, including the 1931 trials of the Scottsboro boys. They had been accused and were convicted of raping two white women in Alabama. Historians have concluded they were innocent.

On the morning of April 7, 1934, his 62nd birthday, William Monroe Trotter died after a fall from the roof of his home in Boston. The cause is uncertain, but it is known that he was depressed and troubled at the time. He may have committed suicide. He was buried in Boston&#x27;s Fairview Cemetery.

==Legacy and honors==
*Several schools and academic institutions were named for him: the William Monroe Trotter Elementary School in Dorchester, the William Monroe Trotter Institute at the University of Massachusetts Boston (a research institute for the study of black history and black culture), and the William Monroe Trotter Multicultural Center (aka Trotter House) at the University of Michigan.
*Trotter&#x27;s first home in Dorchester, the William Monroe Trotter House, was designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition of his significance in the civil rights cause.
*In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed William Monroe Trotter among his 100 Greatest African Americans.

<text>A dormer is a roofed structure, often containing a window, that projects vertically beyond the plane of a pitched roof. A dormer window (also called &quot;dormer&quot;) is a form of roof window.

Dormers are commonly used to increase the usable space in a loft and to create window openings in a roof plane. A dormer is often one of the primary elements of a loft conversion. As a prominent element of many buildings, different types of dormer have evolved to complement different styles of architecture. When the structure appears on the spires of churches and cathedrals, it is usually referred to as a &quot;lucarne&quot;.

==History==
The word &quot;dormer&quot; is derived from the Middle French , meaning &quot;sleeping room&quot;, as dormer windows often provided light and space to attic-level bedrooms.

One of the earliest uses of dormers was in the form of lucarnes, slender dormers which provided ventilation to the spires of English Gothic churches and cathedrals. An early example are the lucarnes of the spire of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. Dormer windows have been used in domestic architecture in Britain since the 16th century. 

Dormer windows were popularised by French architect François Mansart, who used dormers extensively in the mansard roofs he designed for 17th-century Paris.

Today dormers are a widespread feature of pitched roof buildings.

==Types==

Some of the different types of dormer are:

; Gable-fronted dormer: Also called simply a gabled dormer, this is the most common type. It has a simple pitched roof of two sloping planes, supported by an outward face (any combination of glazed and unglazed materials). It thus includes a triangular section below the roofline, i.e. a gable. It is also known as a dog-house dormer (due to its similar shape).
; Hip roof dormer: Also called a hipped dormer, it has a roof composed of three sloping planes that rise from each side of the dormer frame and converge at the ridge—analogous to the hip roof.
; Flat roof dormer: The roof of this dormer is a single flat plane approximately horizontal (although usually slightly inclined to allow rain water to run off).
; Shed dormer: This dormer also has a single flat plane roof, but in this case, it is sloped in the same direction as the principal roof, only at a shallower angle. A shed dormer can provide head room over a larger area than a gabled dormer, but as its roof pitch is shallower than the main roof, it may require a different roof covering.
; Wall dormer: As opposed to the dormer being set part way up the slope of the roof, this is a dormer whose face is coplanar with (shares the horizontal position of) the face of the wall below. This means that the face of the dormer is essentially a continuation of the wall above the level of the eaves. Later structures (during the period of revival styles in 19th-century architecture) feature wall dormers as an important part of eclectic assemblies of elements that make up such styles as New World Queen Anne Revival architecture and the French-inspired Châteauesque style.
; Eyebrow or eyelid dormer: A low and wide dormer with a curved roof and no sides. Instead, the roof covering is gradually curved up and over the dormer in a flattened bell curve. 
; Link dormer: This can be a dormer that houses a chimney or a dormer that joins one part of a roof to another.
; Bonneted dormer: An arched roof dormer, rounded in shape when viewed from front. Popular in Victorian homes, especially in certain areas, like the Southcott-style row-houses called Jellybean Row in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.
; Nantucket dormer: A three-in-one dormer structure composed of two gable dormers connected by a shed dormer in between.
; Lucarne: A dormer on the slope of a Gothic spire, usually slender and gable-fronted.
; Blind or false dormer: A dormer that is only external; it provides no light and may provide no space internally. Often used to make the building appear more aesthetic.

== Requirements for permission to construct ==
In some localities, permission must be sought for construction of dormers and other features. In England and Wales, the General Permitted Development Order states classes of development for which such planning permission is &quot;not&quot; required. Such rights are only applicable outside conservation areas, national parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty or The Broads. Dormers may introduce imbalance in the street scene and be seen as inappropriate within the local setting of streets and buildings.

In Vancouver, there are regulations for laneway houses stating the minimum setback of the face of the dormer from the wall below, with exceptions. This is to prevent overshadowing neighbouring yards.

==Popularity==

Dormers are popular in Ulster, and commonly used to create extra space when a loft is converted into a habitable room.

The battalion has two main roles; it serves as the Norwegian King&#x27;s bodyguards, guarding the royal residences (the Royal Palace in Oslo, Bygdøy Kongsgård and Skaugum) in Oslo, and is also the main infantry unit responsible for the defence of Oslo. The HMKG is located in Huseby leir in Oslo. Huseby leir is located on the old Oslo farm Nordre Huseby gård (Northern Huseby farm), which was acquired by the Norwegian government in the late 19th century.

==History==

The first all-Norwegian unit of the royal guard of Sweden and Norway were a 38-man strong squadron of despatch riders from the Akerhusiske ridende Jægercorpses gevorbne Escadron, and its main function was to go as messengers between Stockholm and Christiania. By 1856 this service was obsolete, and the king decided to form a new Norwegian infantry company to be part of the guard. 

The Norwegian guards company was formally formed from members of the Norwegian Corps of Jäger, mainly from Stjørdal Municipality, on 8 November 1856 by King Oscar I, in order to underline his status as king of both Norway and Sweden. The company moved from Stockholm to Kristiania in 1888, where, in addition to its guards duties, it served as a trials unit. On Norway&#x27;s independence in 1905, the company became the new guards unit for King Haakon VII and was increased to battalion size. The battalion served with distinction during the Second World War, where it prevented the Wehrmacht from capturing the Royal Family and the Cabinet at the Midtskogen Gård on 10 April. This gave the Guards its first battle honour. Later in the campaign, the Guards fought with distinction on Dovrefjell and at Lundehøgda, near Lillehammer, winning their third battle honour. During the campaign in central Norway they were known among the German soldiers who fought them as &quot;die schwarzen Teufel&quot; or &quot;the black devils&quot;, due to their ferocity and dark uniforms.

In August 2022, 30 Royal Guards were kicked out of the armed forces after a process that was said to involve drug testing; however, the chief of the Royal Guard said later in August that the hair samples were not analyzed, due to a &quot;technical failure&quot;. Authorities had earlier in August claimed that the test kits that (allegedly) were used were not considered reliable, therefore the positive tests - the evidence - were not kept in evidence. &quot;The ex-soldiers&quot; are claiming that coersion was used; they were (allegedly) told that &quot;the case&quot; would be on their civilian police-record; however, the Norwegian Armed Forces went over to a new practice two years ago: drug cases do not get turned over to civilian police authorities. The drug tests in 2022 - by taking hair samples - were done by corporals taking hair samples; none of the personnel that work in the &quot;narcotics group&quot; of the military police, were present; the soldiers were given an impression that they would get reduced punishment if they admitted to illegal use of drugs; One soldier called the process a bluff so that one could elicit confessions. The chief of the armed forces&#x27; &quot;narcotics group&quot;, says that drug tests can be done, however if they are done against specific suspects, then (each) drug test has to be part of (any number of individual) criminal cases. As of 26 August 2024, the Chief of Defence is satisfied with the report that he has been given. In December 2024, a trial is underway; 6 of the former soldiers, are suing the government.

==Military organization==

The HMKG is organized as a light infantry battalion of five companies:

Each of the rifle companies takes turns in carrying out guard duty at the royal residences in between other duties. The majority of Guardsmen are National Servicemen who are posted to the regiment after their basic training. On arriving at the battalion from basic training, they spend their first five weeks in ceaseless drill practice, hand-to-hand fighting, physical training, close range firing and case solving exercises before they are allowed to perform their first duties outside the royal palace or around the Royal Family&#x27;s country residence. In addition the guards practice specialized operations within their platoons, and whenever a company becomes the oldest unit within the battalion (longest period of conscription), the company enters service as gardestridsgruppe (guard battle group), GSG, with a 72-hour emergency response time. The mission of the GSG is classified, but it was used during the 22 July attacks on Oslo in 2011.

The changing of the guard ceremony in front of The Palace takes place at 1330–1400 hours every day and is a popular event with tourists and the people of Oslo alike. In addition to performing guard duty, the Guards is also on parade whenever important state events take place in the capital. These include the annual opening of parliament by the King, visits by foreign heads of state, or anniversaries of major events in the history of the nation.

==Traditions==
===Uniform===
The dark blue dress uniforms have remained virtually unchanged throughout the regiment&#x27;s existence. One noteworthy detail of the uniform is the plumed bowler hat, which was copied from the hat of the Italian Bersaglieri troops—a regiment that so impressed the Swedish princess Louise (the great grandmother of King Harald V) that she insisted the Norwegian guards be similarly hatted in 1860. The regiment&#x27;s cap badge is a rosette in the royal colours of Norway, with the monogram of the current monarch.

===Mascot in Scotland===

The regiment&#x27;s official mascot is a king penguin named Nils Olav, a resident of Edinburgh Zoo. The first penguin was adopted during the regiment&#x27;s first participation in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo in 1961 and was given the rank of visekorporal (lance corporal). Nils Olav was promoted each time the King&#x27;s Guard has returned to the Tattoo. In 1982 he was made corporal and was promoted to sergeant in 1987. Nils Olav died shortly after his promotion to sergeant, and his place of honour was taken by Nils Olav II, his two-year-old near-double. He was promoted in 1993 to the rank of regimental sergeant major. On 18 August 2005 he was promoted to Colonel-in-Chief. Nils Olav was the first penguin to hold this rank in the Norwegian army. He was also awarded the Norwegian Army&#x27;s Long Service and Good Conduct medal on that date.
The current mascot is Nils Olav III, who on 15 August 2008 was knighted, then on 22 August 2016 he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier at a ceremony outside the zoo&#x27;s penguin enclosure by British Major General Euan Loudon acting on behalf of Norway&#x27;s King Harald V. Reuters reported that a detachment of the King&#x27;s Guard in full dress uniform was reviewed by the penguin, who wore his new insignia on a badge strapped to one flipper.

<doc id="399199" wikidata="Q239487" url="?curid=399199" title="Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange">
<text>Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange (12 January 1759) was the second child and eldest daughter of King George II of Great Britain and his consort Caroline of Ansbach. She was the wife of William IV, Prince of Orange, the first hereditary stadtholder of all seven provinces of the Northern Netherlands. She was Regent of the Netherlands from 1751 until her death in 1759, exercising extensive powers on behalf of her son William V. She was known as an Anglophile, due to her English upbringing and family connections, but was unable to convince the Dutch Republic to enter the Seven Years&#x27; War on the side of the British. Princess Anne was the second daughter of a British sovereign to hold the title Princess Royal. In the Netherlands she was styled Anna van Hannover.

== Early life ==
Anne was born at Herrenhausen Palace, Hanover, five years before her paternal grandfather, Elector George Louis, succeeded to the thrones of Great Britain and Ireland as George I. She was christened shortly after her birth at Herrenhausen Palace. She was named after her paternal grandfather&#x27;s second cousin Anne, Queen of Great Britain.

She learned German, French and English, and was taught music (including singing, harpsichord, and composition) by Georg Friedrich Händel. Händel did not like teaching, but said he would &quot;make the only exception for Anne, flower of princesses&quot;. She remained a lifelong supporter, attending his operas and subscribing to his music.
Anne contracted and survived smallpox in 1720, and two years later her mother helped to popularise the practice of variolation (an early type of immunisation against smallpox), which had been witnessed by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Charles Maitland in Constantinople. At the direction of Caroline, six prisoners condemned to death were offered the chance to undergo variolation instead of execution: they all survived, as did six orphan children given the same treatment as a further test. Convinced of its medical value, the Queen had her two younger daughters, Amelia and Caroline, inoculated successfully. Anne&#x27;s face was scarred by the disease, and she was not considered as pretty as her two younger sisters.

On 30 August 1727, George II created his eldest daughter Princess Royal, a title which had fallen from use since its creation by Charles I for his daughter Mary, Princess of Orange in 1642.

In 1725, a potential marriage contract between Anne and King Louis XV of France was considered. From a French viewpoint, such a marriage could give France valuable neutrality from The Netherlands and Prussia, as well as protection against Spain. However, the religious issues caused problems. While it was taken for granted that Anne would have to convert to Catholicism, there were concerns that this would still not be enough for the Pope, whose support was needed, particularly regarding the broken betrothal between Louis XV and a Spanish princess, and the prospect of Anne becoming Regent of France in case of a minor regency was feared because of her presumed religious inclinations toward the Huguenots in France. The plans was eventually discarded when the French insisted that Anne must convert to Roman Catholicism.

On in the Chapel Royal at St. James&#x27;s Palace, she married William IV, Prince of Orange. She then ceased to use her British title in favour of the new one she gained by marriage. The music played at her wedding, &quot;This is the day&quot; was set by Handel to the princess&#x27;s own words based on Psalms 45 and 118. Handel also composed an operatic entertainment, &quot;Parnasso in Festa&quot;, in honour of her wedding which was performed for the first time at the King&#x27;s Theatre, London, on 13 March 1734, with great success. 

Nassau Street, Soho, London (renamed Gerrard Place in 1910) was named in honour of the marriage.

William suffered from a spinal deformity, which affected his appearance, but Anne said she would marry him even &quot;if he were a baboon&quot;. Her reason for being so insistent upon this marriage was reported to be simply that she wished to be married, to avoid a life as a spinster at the court of her father and her brother, with whom she did not get along; and as the only match considered suitable for her was with a monarch or heir to a throne, William was essentially her only remaining Protestant choice, and when questioned by her father, she stated that it was not a matter of whether she should marry William, the question was rather whether she should marry at all. She quarreled with her brother, the Prince of Wales, about her choice.

William and Anne sailed to Holland after a honeymoon at Kew. In the Netherlands, they resided at Leeuwarden. Anne soon felt homesick when William went on campaign in the Rhineland, and she travelled back to England, believing herself to be pregnant, Anne thought she should give birth to the child in her homeland as the child would be in the line of succession to the British throne. However, this decision was not well received with her husband and her father, who both commanded her to return to Holland after a brief stay. By April 1735, it was clear that Anne was not with child after all. In 1736, she did become pregnant, but the child (a daughter) was stillborn.

Anne was not well liked by the Dutch people and did not get on well with her mother-in-law Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel. However, Anne was considered to have a regal essence but seemed to have a belief in British superiority over the Dutch; she was also thought to be neglectful of her duties and seemed to isolate herself in her interests in music and literature; and she was accused of displaying little consideration for her courtiers, for example by forcing her ladies-in-waiting to read for her for hours, ignoring their fatigue. Her relationship with William, however, which was at first distant, eventually developed into harmony and intimacy, which is displayed in their correspondence. In 1747, William became stadtholder of all the Seven United Provinces, and this was followed by a constitutional reform which made his new wider authority hereditary. William and Anne moved to the Hague, where Anne introduced Händel to the Netherlands: he accepted her invitation to her music life at the Hague in 1750. The composer Josina van Aerssen was one of her ladies-in-waiting.

== Regency ==

William IV died on 22 October 1751, at the age of forty, and Anne was appointed as regent for her three-year-old son, William V. She gained all the prerogatives normally held by a hereditary stadtholder of the Netherlands, with the exception of the military duties of the office, which were entrusted to Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg. She was hard-working, but arrogant and imperious, which made her unpopular. The 1750s were years of increasing tension and commercial rivalry between Holland and Great Britain, which placed her in a difficult position.

Anne&#x27;s interior policy focused on defending the authority of the central hereditary stadtholder government over the traditional rights of the Dutch states. The reform of the hereditary post of stadtholder had been introduced during the reign of her late husband; it was new and controversial and was questioned after his death, but Anne effectively defended the centralized government. In the conflict with the city of Haarlem, for example, she prevented the city from holding its election by refusing the release of its list of candidates. Her harsh rule was resented, but her consolidation policy effectively secured the new hereditary Stadtholder rule in the Netherlands. 

In her foreign policy, Anne favoured the British alliance with the Emperor before the French, a policy which was not popular in the Netherlands, and her fortification of the southern provinces against the French Netherlands was met with great opposition. 

Anne continued to act as regent until her death from dropsy in 1759, at The Hague, when she was replaced by her mother-in-law, Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel, who was assisted by Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg. When she too died in 1765, Anne&#x27;s daughter, Carolina, was made regent until William V reached the age of eighteen in 1766.

== Works ==
The princess took drawing and painting lessons from Herman van der Mijn and made a self-portrait in 1740 that is in the collection of the House of Orange-Nassau Historic Collections Trust. She also made a portrait of van der Mijn himself while he was at work making portraits of other family members.

== Legacy ==
Princess Anne, Maryland, is named for her.

== Arms ==
On 31 January 1719, as a grandchild of the sovereign, Anne was granted use of the arms of the realm, differenced by a &quot;label argent of five points, each bearing a cross gules&quot;. On 30 August 1727, as a child of the sovereign, Anne&#x27;s difference changed to a &quot;label argent of three points, each bearing a cross gules&quot;.

<text>Booker is a hamlet within the parish of West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, England, which has absorbed into the expanding suburbs of High Wycombe. There are several housing areas in Booker, mainly modern estates. At the 2011 Census the hamlet was included in the High Wycombe Ward of Booker and Cressex.

Booker is also the name frequently given to the local airfield, more properly known as Wycombe Air Park, one of the busiest general aviation airfields in the South East of England. The airfield is used for general aviation and gliding and is home to both helicopters and fixed wing planes.

The airfield is home to the Airways Flying Club and Wycombe Air Centre.

Main parts are mistaken for Cressex, the neighbouring village to the east of the hamlet. This is because there are no proper, recognised borders between Booker, Cressex, Sands and Castlefield.

==History==
The &quot;tithing of Bokar&quot; was referred to in the 13th-century. The etymology of the name is unknown, though it may come from &quot;bōc-ora&quot;.

<text>Friedberg () is a town in the district Aichach-Friedberg, Bavaria, Germany, with some 30,000 inhabitants. It is located next to Augsburg at the river Lech. The town was founded in the 13th century in order to collect a toll from people using the bridge across the Lech.

The town lies almost entirely on the western edge of the hills along the Lechleite, where the river Lech has formed a wide bed from glacial melt water.

==History==
Settlements in the area of Friedberg can be traced to Roman times through archeological findings of pottery and brickworks in the Hügelshart, Rohrbach (dating from the last third of the 3rd Century AD), Stätzling (late 3rd Century to 4th Century AD) and Wulfertshausen districts.

The town is mentioned in historical documents for the first time in letter of protection from Conrad of the House of Hohenstaufen together with Duke Ludwig II, also called &quot;the Strict&quot;, of Bavaria and the Burghers of Augsburg, in 1264. The &quot;Fridberch&quot; castle was subsequently built to serve as a border security and customs post for the Duchy of Bavaria, but put the town in opposition to the free city of Augsburg. The castle was the cause of the first burning of Friedberg by Augsburg in 1396. The town was subject to the many frequent wars between Swabia, Bavaria and Augsburg.

In 1485 Balthasar Hubmaier, a leading figure of the Anabaptist Reformation, was born in the town.

A revival in the town&#x27;s fortunes came when, in 1568, the Duchess Christine chose Friedberg castle as her seat following her husband&#x27;s death. The town became the centre of Bavarian court life, but was short lived when the town was ravaged by the plague in 1599. More suffering came as the town was sacked twice by the Swedes during the Thirty Years War. After the war only the town hall, castle and city walls were left standing. The town was soon flourishing again as the Dukes of Bavaria encouraged artisans to settle in the area with the establishment of guilds in neighbouring Augsburg. Due to overcrowding, Friedberg offered accommodation to those displaced artisans who could not find rooms in Augsburg, and were not yet Master Craftsmen.

The Pilgrimage church of &quot;Our Lord&#x27;s Rest&quot;, the Herrgottsruh, was built in 1753, is considered one of the most beautiful churches of the Bavarian rococo.

The town survived World War II virtually unscathed.

<text>Parbold is a village and civil parish in West Lancashire, England.

==Local government==
Parbold had a population of 2,582 at the 2011 Census.

West Lancashire is divided into 19 parish councils, the first tier of local government. Parbold is bordered by Hilldale to the north, Wrightington to the east, Dalton to the south and Newburgh to the west.

From 1894 to 1974 Parbold was part of the Wigan Rural District, along with Dalton, Haigh, Shevington, Worthington and Wrightington.

==Location==
Parbold lies in the valley of the River Douglas, at the bottom of the western side of Parbold Hill. The village centre is about west of junction 27 of the M6 motorway on the A5209.

The village can also be reached by rail on the line from Manchester to Southport. Close to the village centre the Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes over the River Douglas. The nearest sizable towns are Skelmersdale (about 5 miles away), Ormskirk (7 miles), and Wigan (9 miles).

The village is dominated by Parbold Hill which rises to 400 feet above sea level, the top of which is approximately 1 mile to the east of the village. The top of the hill overlooks the West Lancashire plain and the North West of England across to Liverpool, Manchester and Wales. Wood Lane, just off the main road, is also known for its views of the surrounding countryside.

==History==

The earliest known reference to Parbold is in the late 12th century, where grants of land were made to nearby Burscough Priory (pronounced &quot;Bursk-owe&quot;). After the Norman Conquest, Parbold was part of the Barony of Manchester. Little development occurred from this time to the mid 18th century. Parbold became a civil parish in 1894.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, a number of coal mines worked nearby, rather meagre, seams; hard sandstone was also quarried. Both coal and sandstone could be exported over the waterways; boatbuilding was a minor economic activity in Parbold around this time. The old windmill that is located next to the canal replaced an earlier water cornmill which once stood on Alder Lane, and was in use until 1985.

Parbold railway station, built in the mid 19th century by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, radically altered the village; it allowed middle class workers to live in Parbold and commute to urban areas throughout the north-west. In recent years a direct hourly service has operated to Manchester Airport railway station giving quick access (less than 1 hour and 15 minutes journey time) to flights from Manchester Airport. The railway station also provided a natural centre for the village which it still is today.

Parbold&#x27;s war memorial is in the local Anglican church, Christ Church, near the top of Parbold Hill. The village&#x27;s other church – Our Lady and All Saints – was consecrated by Bishop Robert Cornthwaite on 28 May 1884.

Composer Hugh Wood (1932–2021) was born in Parbold.

==Amenities==
Parbold has two churches, two primary schools and a nursery, a library built in 1989, a purpose-built village hall which doubles as a cinema and community centre, a telephone exchange, a doctor&#x27;s surgery, a sub post office and a number of other shops including a pharmacy, a newsagent, an estate agent, three hairdressers and both Chinese and Indian takeaways plus a greengrocery. There are two pubs along the main road through the centre of the village – the &quot;Windmill&quot; and the &quot;Stocks Tavern&quot;. Along with a branch of the Miller and Carter Steakhouse at the top of the hill and the Wayfarer: brew pub and dining rooms providing al a carte and Italian style foods. The windmill in the village was built in 1794 but has not milled since about 1850 and is now a gallery for James Bartholomew.

==Sport==

Two semi-professional football clubs are based nearby: Skelmersdale United (Northern Premier League Division One North) and Burscough (Conference North). Shevington Sharks ARLFC youth teams train and play on the Alder Lane Playing Fields.

An annual fell race is run over Parbold Hill.

<doc id="399213" wikidata="Q349785" url="?curid=399213" title="Paul Volcker">
<text>Paul Adolph Volcker Jr. (September 5, 1927 – December 8, 2019) was an American economist who served as the 12th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987. During his tenure as chairman, Volcker was widely credited with having ended the high levels of inflation seen in the United States throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, with measures known as the &quot;Volcker shock&quot;. He previously served as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1975 to 1979.

President Jimmy Carter nominated him to succeed G. William Miller as Fed chairman and President Ronald Reagan renominated him once. Volcker did not seek a third term at the Fed and was succeeded by Alan Greenspan. After his retirement from the Board, he chaired the Economic Recovery Advisory Board under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 during the subprime mortgage crisis.

==Early life and education==
Volcker was born in Cape May, New Jersey, the son of Alma Louise (née Klippel, 1892–1990) and Paul Adolph Volcker (1889–1960). All his grandparents were of German origin. Volcker grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey, where his father was the township&#x27;s first municipal manager. Paul Sr. thrived in the role for 20 years as he improved the burgeoning town&#x27;s economic stability and the local government&#x27;s effectiveness. Paul Jr. had four older sisters: Ruth (1916–1991), Louise (1918–1966), Elinor (1922–1923) and Virginia Streitfeld (1924–2011). As a child, he attended his mother&#x27;s Lutheran church, while his father went to an Episcopal church. Volcker graduated from Teaneck High School in 1945, where he participated in several student groups and impressed his peers and teachers with his knowledge of politics.

Volcker attended Princeton University as an undergraduate student and graduated with highest honors from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs (now the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs) in 1949. In his senior thesis, titled &quot;The Problems of Federal Reserve Policy since World War II&quot;, Volcker criticized the Federal Reserve&#x27;s post-WWII policies for failing to curb inflationary pressures, writing, &quot;a swollen money supply presented a grave inflationary threat to the economy. There was a need to bring this money supply under control if the disastrous effects of a sharp price rise were to be avoided.&quot; Following a summer as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he moved to Harvard University to earn an M.A. in political economy from its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Graduate School of Public Administration. He worked a second summer as a New York Fed research assistant before graduating in 1951. After Harvard, Volcker attended the London School of Economics from 1951 to 1952 as a Rotary Foundation Ambassadorial Fellow under Rotary&#x27;s Ambassadorial Scholarships program.

==Career==
In 1952, Volcker joined the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a full-time economist. He left that position in 1957 to become a financial economist with the Chase Manhattan Bank. In 1962, Robert Roosa, who had been his mentor at the Federal Reserve, hired him at the Treasury Department as director of financial analysis. In 1963, he became deputy under secretary for monetary affairs. He returned to Chase Manhattan Bank as vice president and director of planning in 1965.

Appointed by the Nixon Administration, Volcker served under secretary of the Treasury for international monetary affairs from 1969 to 1974. He played an important role in President Richard Nixon&#x27;s decision to suspend gold convertibility of the dollar on August 15, 1971, which resulted in the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Volcker considered the suspension of gold convertibility &quot;the single most important event of his career.&quot; Because of his position as under secretary, Volcker served as a board member for OPIC and Fannie Mae. Across the policies he worked on, he acted as a moderating influence on policy, advocating the pursuit of an international solution to monetary problems and acting as a negotiator with other nations&#x27; policymakers. After leaving the U.S. Treasury, he spent a year as a senior fellow at Princeton&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson School (his alma mater). In 1975, he became President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and he retained that role until he became Federal Reserve Chairman in August 1979.

===Chairman of the Federal Reserve===

After G. William Miller&#x27;s confirmation as Secretary of the Treasury, President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s confirmation of Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Frederick H. Schultz&#x27;s role as Acting Chairman sent markets panicking. Carter resultingly sought a reassuring, qualified nominee who would confront inflation head-on, and nominated Paul Volcker to serve as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on July 25, 1979. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 2, 1979, and took office on August 6, 1979. President Ronald Reagan renominated Volcker to a second term in 1983.

Inflation emerged as an economic and political challenge in the United States during the 1970s. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve board, led by Volcker, were widely credited with curbing the rate of inflation and expectations that inflation would continue. US inflation, which peaked at 14.8 percent in March 1980, fell below 3 percent by 1983. The Federal Reserve board led by Volcker raised the federal funds rate, which had averaged 11.2% in 1979, to a peak of 20% in June 1981. The prime rate rose to 21.5% in 1981 as well, which helped lead to the 1980–1982 recession, in which the national unemployment rate rose to over 10%. In addition to the rises in key interest rates, the so-called &#x27;Volcker shock&#x27; included monetarist-inspired policies, such as targeting the money supply. Despite the fact that monetarist economists did not recognize Volcker policies to be totally monetarist, some members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) claimed to follow monetarist principles.

Volcker&#x27;s Federal Reserve board elicited the strongest political attacks and most widespread protests in the history of the Federal Reserve (unlike any protests experienced since 1922), due to the effects of high interest rates on the construction, farming, and industrial sectors, culminating in indebted farmers driving their tractors onto C Street NW in Washington, D.C. and blockading the Eccles Building. Aggrieved homebuilders mailed the Fed pieces of 2x4 lumber in protest. The &#x27;Volcker shock&#x27; also entailed strong disturbances within the European Monetary System and has therefore been deeply criticized in Europe. US monetary policy eased in 1982, helping lead to a resumption of economic growth.

In July 1984, Volcker was summoned to a meeting with President Reagan and then White House Chief of Staff James Baker. In the meeting, Baker ordered him not to raise rates in the lead-up to the 1984 presidential election. Volcker wrote in his memoir that he was &quot;stunned,&quot; but since he had not intended to raise rates and felt the White House wouldn&#x27;t publicize it, he did not speak of the meeting to the press.

The US current account was in permanent deficit by the 1990s. Volcker himself tried to remedy the situation by the Plaza Accord in 1986, which called for Germany and Japan to revalue relative to the US dollar.

The combination of the Fed&#x27;s tight money policies and the expansive fiscal policy of the Reagan Administration (large tax cuts and a major increase in military spending) produced large federal budget deficits and significant macroeconomic imbalances in the U.S. economy. The combination of growing federal debt and high interest rates led to a substantial rise in federal net interest costs. The sharp rise of interest costs and large deficits led Congress to take some steps towards fiscal constraint.

Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz said about him in an interview:

Paul Volcker, the previous Fed Chairman known for keeping inflation under control, was fired because the Reagan administration didn&#x27;t believe he was an adequate de-regulator.

Congressman Ron Paul, well known as a harsh critic of the Federal Reserve, offered qualified praise of Volcker:

Being in Congress in the late 1970s and early 1980s and serving on the House Banking Committee, I met and got to question several Federal Reserve chairmen: Arthur Burns, G. William Miller, and Paul Volcker. Of the three, I had the most interaction with Volcker. He was more personable and smarter than the others, including the more recent board chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.

In 1983, Volcker received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

==Post-Federal Reserve==

After leaving the Federal Reserve in 1987, he became chairman of the prominent New York investment banking firm, Wolfensohn &amp; Co., a corporate advisory and investment firm run by James D. Wolfensohn (who later became President of the World Bank).

In 1992, Volcker was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1993 he chaired the Group of 30 Report on the Derivatives market entitled &quot;Derivatives: Practices and Principles&quot; with several appendices and a survey on how practices may have changed since the original 1993 report. The Group of 30 is a &quot;consultative group on international economic and monetary affairs.&quot; Volcker was their Chairman &quot;emeritus.&quot;

In 1996, he took up the chair of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (Volcker Commission) to look into the dormant accounts of Jewish victims of the Holocaust lying in Swiss banks. This included a &quot;massive accounting of Swiss bank records.&quot; In the midst of a contentious process (the committee was formed by three Jewish representatives and three representatives of Swiss banks), he was able to bring about an agreement among the parties for a settlement of $1.25 billion.

Volcker was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1992.

In 2000 he accepted the Chairmanship of the IFRS Trustees, the not-for-profit funding arm of the International Accounting Standards Board (later the IFRS Foundation). The IFRS Foundation is a private sector enterprise based in London which seeks to develop a single global accounting model, subject to adoption country by country under their rules of law.

In 2001 Paul Volcker joined The Conference Board, an economic and business think-tank based in NY, as a senior advisor supporting research on corporate governance, analysis of business cylcles and economic policy. His activities there primarily focused on guiding the research staff and engaging global business leaders to support The Conference Board&#x27;s activities promoting free-markets, economic analysis and responsible corporate governance. Other Federal Reserve Chairs affiliated with The Conference Board include Alan Greenspan, who was a researcher there from 1948 to 1953, when it was known as the National Industrial Conference Board.

In April 2004, the United Nations assigned Volcker to research possible corruption in the Iraqi Oil for Food program. In the report summarizing its research, Volcker criticized Kojo Annan, son of then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA, Kojo&#x27;s employer, for trying to conceal their relationship. He concluded in his March 2005, report that &quot;there is no evidence that the selection of Cotecna, in 1998, was subject to improper influence of the Secretary General in the bidding or selection process.&quot; While Volcker did not implicate the Secretary General in the selection process, however, he did cast serious doubt on Kofi Annan, whose &quot;management performance ... fell short of the standards that the United Nations Organization should strive to maintain.&quot; Volcker was a director of the United Nations Association of the United States of America between 2000 and 2004, prior to his being appointed to the Independent Inquiry by Kofi Annan.

As of October 2006, he was the chairman of the board of trustees of the influential Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty, and a member of the Trilateral Commission. He had a long association with the Rockefeller family, not only with his positions at Chase Bank and the Trilateral Commission, but also through membership of the trust committee of Rockefeller Group, Inc., which he joined in 1987. That entity managed, at one time, the Rockefeller Center on behalf of the numerous members of the Rockefeller family. He was a chairman and an honorary trustee of International House, the cultural exchange residence and program center in New York City. He was a founding member of the Trilateral Commission and a long-time member of the Bilderberg Group.

In January 2008, he endorsed Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama in the upcoming presidential election.

On April 8, 2008, he was the featured speaker at The Economic Club of New York. Volcker discussed &quot;what appears to be in substance a direct transfer of mortgage and mortgage-backed securities of questionable pedigree from an investment bank to the Federal Reserve,&quot; and offered his detailed analysis and evaluation of interrelationships among the U.S. capital markets, Federal Reserve policies, and the economy as whole.

Paul Volcker appeared in the Charles Ferguson&#x27;s movie &quot;Inside Job&quot;. He was interviewed about current Wall Street CEO pay, claiming it is &quot;excessive.&quot;

Volcker was an economic advisor to President Barack Obama, heading the President&#x27;s Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Volcker had also been Obama&#x27;s first pick as United States Secretary of the Treasury, but he was considered too old. During the financial crisis, Volcker was extremely critical of banks, saying that their response to the financial crisis was inadequate, and that more regulation of banks is called for. Specifically, Volcker called for a break-up of the nation&#x27;s largest banks, prohibiting deposit-taking institutions from engaging in riskier activities such as proprietary trading, private equity, and hedge fund investments (see Volcker Rule). Volcker left the board when its charter expired on February 6, 2011, without being included in discussions on how the board would be reconstituted.

On January 21, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed bank regulations which he dubbed &quot;The Volcker Rule,&quot; in reference to Volcker&#x27;s aggressive pursuit of these regulations. Volcker appeared with the president at the announcement. The proposed rules would prevent commercial banks from owning and investing in hedge funds and private equity, and limit the trading they do for their own accounts. According to SEC Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar, &quot;[t]he success or failure of the Volcker Rule will depend on the manner in which banking entities comply with the letter and spirit of the rule, and on the willingness of regulators to enforce it.&quot;

Volcker was known to defy the stereotype of a Wall Street insider. A profile in &quot;The Week&quot; for February 5, 2010, stated that Volcker does not agree with the conventional wisdom that &quot;financial innovation&quot; is necessary for a healthy economy. In fact, he likes to say, &quot;the only useful banking innovation was the invention of the ATM.&quot;

On April 6, 2010, at the New-York Historical Society&#x27;s Global Economic Panel, Volcker commented that the United States should consider adding a national sales tax similar to the Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed in European countries, stating &quot;If, at the end of the day, we need to raise taxes, we should raise taxes.&quot;

In 2011, Volcker and former Secretary of State George Shultz authored an article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; voicing their opinion that the War on Drugs had failed. They did not advocate for the legalization of drugs, but rather for a reexamination of the costs of drug prohibition in the United States.

In 2015, Volcker donated his public service papers to Princeton University&#x27;s Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library.

===World Justice Project===
Volcker served as an honorary co-chairman for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works to lead a global, multi-disciplinary effort to strengthen the rule of law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.

=== Volcker Alliance ===
In 2013, Volcker founded the nonprofit organization the Volcker Alliance to address the challenge of effective execution of public policies and to rebuild public trust in government. The nonpartisan Alliance works toward that objective by partnering with other organizations—academic, business, governmental, and public interest—to strengthen professional education for public service, conduct needed research on government performance, and improve the efficiency and accountability of governmental organization at the federal, state, and local levels.

===Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget===
Volcker served on the board of directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The nonpartisan organization is &quot;committed to educating the public on issues with significant fiscal policy impact.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Volcker married Barbara Bahnson, the daughter of a physician, on September 11, 1954. They had two children, Janice, a nurse and a Georgetown University graduate, and James, a research assistant and a New York University graduate who was born with cerebral palsy. They also had four grandchildren. His younger sister died young, and two of his three older sisters, Louise and Ruth, never married. His other older sister, Virginia, was married to and divorced from Harold Streitfeld; they have five children.

Volcker was an avid fly-fisherman, who recounted in 1987, &quot;The greatest strategic error of my adult life was to take my wife to Maine on our honeymoon on a fly-fishing trip.&quot; Volcker was known as &quot;Tall Paul&quot; for his height of , standing exactly a foot (30 cm) taller than his first wife, Barbara, when they first met. She died on June 14, 1998, having suffered from lifelong diabetes, as well as rheumatoid arthritis. Over Thanksgiving, 2009, he became engaged to Anke Dening, a long-time assistant. They married in February 2010.

===Death===
Volcker died in New York City on December 8, 2019, at age 92. He had reportedly been treated for prostate cancer since being diagnosed the year prior.

==Honorary degrees==
Volcker received honorary degrees from several educational institutions, including: Baytown Christian Academy, Hamilton College (1980), University of Notre Dame, Princeton University, Dartmouth College, New York University, University of Delaware, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Bryant College, Adelphi University, Lamar University, Bates College (1989), Fairfield University (1994), York University (2001), Williams College (2003), Northwestern University (2004), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (2005), Brown University (2006), Georgetown University (2007), Syracuse University (2008), Queen&#x27;s University (2009), Amherst College (2011), and at the University of Toronto (2015).

Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, where Volker served on the advisory board from 2001 until his death, established the &quot;Paul Volcker Chair&quot; in Behavioral economics in 2011.

<text>Mesoamerican chronology divides the history of prehispanic Mesoamerica into several periods: the Paleo-Indian (first human habitation until 3500 BCE); the Archaic (before 2600 BCE), the Preclassic or Formative (2500 BCE – 250 CE), the Classic (250–900 CE), and the Postclassic (); as well as the post European contact Colonial Period (1521–1821), and Postcolonial, or the period after independence from Spain (1821–present).

The periodisation of Mesoamerica by researchers is based on archaeological, ethnohistorical, and modern cultural anthropology research dating to the early twentieth century. Archaeologists, ethnohistorians, historians, and cultural anthropologists continue to work to develop cultural histories of the region.

==Overview==
===Paleo-Indian period===
18000–8000 BCE
The Paleo-Indian (less frequently, Lithic) period or era is that which spans from the first signs of human presence in the region, which many believe to have happened due to the Bering Land Bridge, to the establishment of agriculture and other practices (e.g. pottery, permanent settlements) and subsistence techniques characteristic of proto-civilizations. In Mesoamerica, the termination of this phase and its transition into the succeeding Archaic period may generally be reckoned at between 10,000 and 8000 BCE. This dating is approximate only and different timescales may be used between fields and sub-regions.

===Archaic Era===

Before 2600 BCE

During the Archaic Era agriculture was developed in the region and permanent villages were established. Late in this era, use of pottery and loom weaving became common, and class divisions began to appear. Many of the basic technologies of Mesoamerica in terms of stone-grinding, drilling, pottery etc. were established during this period.

===Preclassic Era or Formative Period===
2000 BCE – 250 CE

During the Preclassic Era, or Formative Period, large-scale ceremonial architecture, writing, cities, and states developed. Many of the distinctive elements of Mesoamerican civilization can be traced to this period, including the dominance of corn, the building of pyramids, human sacrifice, jaguar-worship, the complex calendar, and many of the gods.The Olmec civilization developed and flourished at such sites as La Venta and San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, eventually succeeded by the Epi-Olmec culture between 300–250 BCE. The Zapotec civilization arose in the Valley of Oaxaca, the Teotihuacan civilization arose in the Valley of Mexico. The Maya civilization began to develop in the Mirador Basin (in modern-day Guatemala) and the Epi-Olmec culture in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (in modern-day Chiapas), later expanding into Guatemala and the Yucatan Peninsula.

In Central America, there were some Olmec influences, the archaeological sites of Los Naranjos and Yarumela in Honduras stand out, built by ancestors of the Lencas, which reflect an architectural influence of this culture on Central American soil. Other sites with possible Olmec influence have been reported, such as Puerto Escondido, in the Sula Valley, near La Lima, and Hato Viejo in the department of Olancho, where a jadeite statuette has been found that shares many characteristics with those found in Mexico.

===Classic Period===

250–900 CE

The Classic Period was dominated by numerous independent city-states in the Maya region and also featured the beginnings of political unity in central Mexico and the Yucatán. Regional differences between cultures grew more manifest. The city-state of Teotihuacan dominated the Valley of Mexico until the early 8th century, but little is known of the political structure of the region because the Teotihuacanos left no written records. The city-state of Monte Albán dominated the Valley of Oaxaca until the late Classic, leaving limited records in their script, which is as yet mostly undeciphered. Highly sophisticated arts such as stuccowork, architecture, sculptural reliefs, mural painting, pottery, and lapidary developed and spread during the Classic era.

In the Maya region, under considerable military influence by Teotihuacan after the &quot;arrival&quot; of Siyaj K&#x27;ak&#x27; in 378 CE, numerous city states such as Tikal, Uaxactun, Calakmul, Copán, Quirigua, Palenque, Cobá, and Caracol reached their zeniths. Each of these polities was generally independent, although they often formed alliances and sometimes became vassal states of each other. The main conflict during this period was between Tikal and Calakmul, which fought a series of wars over the course of more than half a millennium. Each of these states declined during the Terminal Classic and were eventually abandoned.

===Postclassic Period===

900–1521 CE

In the Postclassic Period many of the great nations and cities of the Classic Era collapsed, although some continued, such as in Oaxaca, Cholula, and the Maya of Yucatan, such as at Chichen Itza and Uxmal. This is sometimes thought to have been a period of increased chaos and warfare.

The Postclassic is often viewed as a period of cultural decline. However, it was a time of technological advancement in architecture, engineering, and weaponry. Metallurgy (introduced c. 800) came into use for jewelry and some tools, with new alloys and techniques being developed in a few centuries. The Postclassic was a period of rapid movement and population growth—especially in Central Mexico post-1200—and of experimentation in governance. For instance, in Yucatan, &#x27;dual rulership&#x27; apparently replaced the more theocratic governments of Classic times, while oligarchic councils operated in much of central Mexico. Likewise, it appears that the wealthy &quot;pochteca&quot; (merchant class) and military orders became more powerful than was apparently the case in Classic times. This afforded some Mesoamericans a degree of social mobility.

The Toltec for a time dominated central Mexico in the 9th–10th century, then collapsed. The northern Maya were for a time united under Mayapan. Oaxaca was briefly united by Mixtec rulers in the 11th–12th centuries.

The Aztec Empire arose in the early 15th century and appeared to be on a path to asserting dominance over the Valley of Mexico region not seen since Teotihuacan. By the 15th century, the Mayan &#x27;revival&#x27; in Yucatan and southern Guatemala and the flourishing of Aztec imperialism evidently enabled a renaissance of fine arts and science. Examples include the &#x27;Pueblan-Mexica&#x27; style in pottery, codex illumination, and goldwork, the flourishing of Nahua poetry, and the botanical institutes established by the Aztec elite.

Spain was the first European power to contact Mesoamerica. Its conquistadors, aided by numerous native allies, conquered the Aztecs.

===Colonial Period===

1521–1821 CE

The Colonial Period was initiated with the Spanish conquest (1519–1521), which ended the hegemony of the Aztec Empire. It was accomplished with Spaniards&#x27; strategic alliances with enemies of the empire, most especially Tlaxcala, but also Huexotzinco, Xochimilco, and even Texcoco, a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance.

Although not all parts of Mesoamerica were brought under control of the Spanish Empire immediately, the defeat of the Aztecs marked the dramatic beginning of an inexorable process of conquest in Mesoamerica and incorporation that Spain completed in the mid-seventeenth century.

Indigenous peoples did not disappear, although their numbers were greatly reduced in the sixteenth century by new infectious diseases brought by the Spanish invaders; they suffered high mortality from slave labor, and during epidemics. The fall of Tenochtitlan marked the beginning of the three-hundred-year colonial period and the imposition of Spanish rule.

=== Chronology ===


==Cultural horizons of Mesoamerica==
Mesoamerican civilisation was a complex network of different cultures. As seen in the time-line below, these did not necessarily occur at the same time. The processes that gave rise to each of the cultural systems of Mesoamerica were very complex and not determined solely by the internal dynamics of each society. External as well as endogenous factors influenced their development. Among these factors, for example, were the relations between human groups and between humans and the environment, human migrations, and natural disasters.

Historians and archaeologists divide pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican history into three periods. The Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire (1519–1521) marks the end of indigenous rule and the incorporation of indigenous peoples as subjects of the Spanish Empire for the 300 year colonial period. The postcolonial period began with Mexican independence in 1821 and continues to the present day. European conquest did not end the existence of Mesoamerica&#x27;s indigenous peoples, but did subject them to new political regimes. In the chart below of prehispanic cultures, the dates mentioned are approximations, and that the transition from one period to another did not occur at the same time nor under the same circumstances in all societies.

===Timeline of pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica===
===Preclassic Era===
The Preclassic period ran from 2500 BCE to 200 CE. Its beginnings are marked by the development of the first ceramic traditions in the West, specifically at sites such as Matanchén, Nayarit, and Puerto Marqués, in Guerrero. Some authors hold that the early development of pottery in this area is related to the ties between South America and the coastal peoples of Mexico. The advent of ceramics is taken as an indicator of a sedentary society, and it signals the divergence of Mesoamerica from the hunter-gatherer societies in the desert to the north.

The Preclassic Era (also known as the Formative Period) is divided into three phases: the Early (2500–1200 BCE), Middle (1500–600 BCE), and Late (600 BCE – 200 CE). During the first phase, the manufacture of ceramics was widespread across the entire region, the cultivation of maize and vegetables became well-established, and society started to become socially stratified in a process that concluded with the appearance of the first hierarchical societies along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the early Preclassic period, the Capacha culture acted as a driving force in the process of civilizing Mesoamerica, and its pottery spread widely across the region.

By 2500 BCE, small settlements were developing in Guatemala&#x27;s Pacific Lowlands, places such as Tilapa, La Blanca, Ocós, El Mesak, Ujuxte, and others, where the oldest ceramic pottery from Guatemala have been found. From 2000 BCE a heavy concentration of pottery in the Pacific Coast Line has been documented. Recent excavations suggest that the Highlands were a geographic and temporal bridge between Early Preclassic villages of the Pacific coast and later Petén lowlands cities. In Monte Alto near La Democracia, Escuintla, in the Pacific lowlands of Guatemala, some giant stone heads and potbelly sculptures () have been found, dated at , of the so-named Monte Alto Culture.
Around 1500 BCE, the cultures of the West entered a period of decline, accompanied by an assimilation into the other peoples with whom they had maintained connections. As a result, the Tlatilco culture emerged in the Valley of Mexico, and the Olmec culture in the Gulf. Tlatilco was one of the principal Mesoamerican population centers of this period. Its people were adept at harnessing the natural resources of Lake Texcoco and at cultivating maize. Some authors posit that Tlatilco was founded and inhabited by the ancestors of today&#x27;s Otomi people.

The Olmecs, on the other hand, had entered into an expansionist phase that led them to construct their first works of monumental architecture at San Lorenzo and La Venta. The Olmecs exchanged goods within their own core area and with sites as far away as Guerrero and Morelos and present day Guatemala and Costa Rica. San José Mogote, a site that also shows Olmec influences, ceded dominance of the Oaxacan plateau to Monte Albán toward the end of the middle Preclassic Era. During this same time, the Chupícuaro culture flourished in Bajío, while along the Gulf the Olmecs entered a period of decline.
One of the great cultural milestones that marked the Middle Preclassic period is the development of the first writing system, by either the Maya, the Olmec, or the Zapotec. During this period, the Mesoamerican societies were highly stratified. The connections between different centers of power permitted the rise of regional elites that controlled natural resources and peasant labor. This social differentiation was based on the possession of certain technical knowledge, such as astronomy, writing, and commerce. Furthermore, the Middle Preclassic period saw the beginnings of the process of urbanization that would come to define the societies of the Classic period. In the Maya area, cities such as Nakbe c. 1000 BCE, El Mirador c. 650 BCE, Cival c. 350 BCE, and San Bartolo show the same monumental architecture of the Classic period. In fact, El Mirador is the largest Maya city. It has been argued that the Maya experienced a first collapse c. 100 CE, and resurged c. 250 in the Classic period. Some population centers such as Tlatilco, Monte Albán, and Cuicuilco flourished in the final stages of the Preclassic period. Meanwhile, the Olmec populations shrank and ceased to be major players in the area.

Toward the end of the Preclassic period, political and commercial hegemony shifted to the population centers in the Valley of Mexico. Around Lake Texcoco there existed a number of villages that grew into true cities: Tlatilco and Cuicuilco are examples. The former was found on the northern bank of the lake, while the latter was on the slopes of the mountainous region of Ajusco. Tlatilco maintained strong relationships with the cultures of the West, so much so that Cuicuilco controlled commerce in the Maya area, Oaxaca, and the Gulf coast. The rivalry between the two cities ended with the decline of Tlatilco. Meanwhile, at Monte Albán in the Valley of Oaxaca, the Zapotec had begun developing culturally independent of the Olmec, adopting aspects of that culture but making their own contributions as well. On the southern coast of Guatemala, Kaminaljuyú advanced in the direction of what would be the Classic Maya culture, even though its links to Central Mexico and the Gulf would initially provide their cultural models. Apart from the West, where the tradition of the Tumbas de tiro had taken root, in all the regions of Mesoamerica the cities grew in wealth, with monumental constructions carried out according to urban plans that were surprisingly complex. The circular pyramid of Cuicuilco dates from this time, as well as the central plaza of Monte Albán, and the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacan.

Around the start of the common era, Cuicuilco had disappeared, and the hegemony over the Mexican basin had passed to Teotihuacan. The next two centuries marked the period in which the so-called &quot;city of the gods&quot; consolidated its power, becoming the premier Mesoamerican city of the first millennium, and the principal political, economic, and cultural center for the next seven centuries.

====The Olmec====

For many years, the Olmec culture was thought to be the &#x27;mother culture&#x27; of Mesoamerica, because of the great influence that it exercised throughout the region. However, more recent perspectives consider this culture to be more of a process to which all the contemporary peoples contributed, and which eventually crystallized on the coasts of Veracruz and Tabasco. The ethnic identity of the Olmecs is still widely debated. Based on linguistic evidence, archaeologists and anthropologists generally believe that they were either speakers of an Oto-Manguean language, or (more likely) the ancestors of the present-day Zoque people who live in the north of Chiapas and Oaxaca. According to this second hypothesis, Zoque tribes emigrated toward the south after the fall of the major population centers of the Gulf plains. Whatever their origin, these bearers of Olmec culture arrived at the leeward shore some eight thousand years BCE, entering like a wedge among the fringe of proto-Maya peoples who lived along the coast, a migration that would explain the separation of the Huastecs of the north of Veracruz from the rest of the Maya peoples based in the Yucatán Peninsula and Guatemala.

The Olmec culture represents a milestone of Mesoamerican history, as various characteristics that define the region first appeared there. Among them are the state organization, the development of the 260-day ritual calendar and the 365-day secular calendar, the first writing system, and urban planning. The development of this culture started 1600 to 1500 BCE, though it continued to consolidate itself up to the 12th century BCE. Its principal sites were La Venta, San Lorenzo, and Tres Zapotes in the core region. However, throughout Mesoamerica numerous sites show evidence of Olmec occupation, especially in the Balsas river basin, where Teopantecuanitlan is located. This site is quite enigmatic, since it dates from several centuries earlier than the main populations of the Gulf, a fact which has continued to cause controversy and given rise to the hypothesis that the Olmec culture originated in that region.

Among the best-known expressions of Olmec culture are giant stone heads, sculptured monoliths up to three meters in height and several tons in weight. These feats of Olmec stonecutting are especially impressive when one considers that Mesoamericans lacked iron tools and that the heads are at sites dozens of kilometers from the quarries where their basalt was mined. The function of these monuments is unknown. Some authors propose that they were commemorative monuments for notable players of the ballgame, and others that they were images of the Olmec governing elite.

The Olmec are also known for their small carvings made of jade and other greenstones. So many of the Olmec figurines and sculptures contain representations of the were-jaguar, that, according to José María Covarrubias, they could be forerunners of the worship of the rain god, or maybe a predecessor of the future Tezcatlipoca in his manifestation as Tepeyolohtli, the &quot;Heart of the Mountain&quot;

The exact causes of the Olmec decline are unknown.

In the Pacific lowlands of the Maya Area, Takalik Abaj c. 800 BCE, Izapa c. 700 BCE, and Chocola c. 600 BCE, along with Kaminaljuyú c. 800 BCE, in the central Highlands of Guatemala, advanced in the direction of what would be the Classic Maya culture. Apart from the West, where the tradition of the Tumbas de tiro had taken root, in all the regions of Mesoamerica the cities grew in wealth, with monumental constructions carried out according to urban plans that were surprisingly complex. La Danta in El Mirador, the San Bartolo murals, and the circular pyramid of Cuicuilco date from this time, as do the central plaza of Monte Albán and the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacan.

Toward the end of the Preclassic period, political and commercial hegemony shifted to the population centers in the Valley of Mexico. Around Lake Texcoco there existed a number of villages that grew into true cities: Tlatilco and Cuicuilco are examples. The former was found on the northern bank of the lake, while the latter was on the slopes of the mountainous region of Ajusco. Tlatilco maintained strong relationships with the cultures of the West, so much so that Cuicuilco controlled commerce in the Maya area, Oaxaca, and the Gulf coast. The rivalry between the two cities ended with the decline of Tlatilco. Meanwhile, at Monte Albán in Oaxaca, the Zapotec had begun developing culturally independent of the Olmec, adopting aspects of that culture and making their own contributions as well.
In Peten, the great Classic Maya cities of Tikal, Uaxactun, and Seibal, began their growth at c. 300 BCE.

Cuicuilco&#x27;s hegemony over the valley declined in the period 100 BCE to 1 CE. As Cuicuilco declined, Teotihuacan began to grow in importance. The next two centuries marked the period in which the so-called &quot;City of the gods&quot; consolidated its power, becoming the premier Mesoamerican city of the first millennium, and the principal political, economic, and cultural center in Central Mexico for the next seven centuries.

===Classic period===


The Classic period of Mesoamerica includes the years from 250 to 900 CE. The end point of this period varied from region to region: for example, in the center of Mexico it is related to the fall of the regional centers of the late Classic (sometimes called Epiclassic) period, toward the year 900; in the Gulf, with the decline of El Tajín, in the year 800; in the Maya area, with the abandonment of the highland cities in the 9th century; and in Oaxaca, with the disappearance of Monte Albán around 850. Normally, the Classic period in Mesoamerica is characterized as the stage in which the arts, science, urbanism, architecture, and social organization reached their peak. This period was also dominated by the influence of Teotihuacan throughout the region, and the competition between the different Mesoamerican states led to continuous warfare.

This period of Mesoamerican history can be divided into three phases. Early, from 250 to 550 CE; Middle, from 550 to 700; and Late, from 700 to 900. The early Classic period began with the expansion of Teotihuacan, which led to its control over the principal trade routes of northern Mesoamerica. During this time, the process of urbanization that started in the last centuries of the early Preclassic period was consolidated. The principal centers of this phase were Monte Albán, Kaminaljuyu, Ceibal, Tikal, and Calakmul, and then Teotihuacan, in which 80 per cent of the 200,000 inhabitants of the Lake Texcoco basin were concentrated.

The cities of this era were characterized by their multi-ethnic composition, which entailed the cohabitation in the same population centers of people with different languages, cultural practices, and places of origin. During this period the alliances between the regional political elites were strengthened, especially for those allied with Teotihuacan. Also, social differentiation became more pronounced: a small dominant group ruled over the majority of the population. This majority was forced to pay tribute and to participate in the building of public structures such as irrigation systems, religious edifices, and means of communication. The growth of the cities could not have happened without advances in agricultural methods and the strengthening of trade networks involving not only the peoples of Mesoamerica, but also the distant cultures of Oasisamerica.

The arts of Mesoamerica reached their high-point in this era. Especially notable are the Maya stelae (carved pillars), exquisite monuments commemorating the stories of the Royal families, the rich corpus of polychrome ceramics, mural painting, and music. In Teotihuacan, architecture made great advances: the Classic style was defined by the construction of pyramidal bases that sloped upward in a step-wise fashion. The Teotihuacan architectural style was reproduced and modified in other cities throughout Mesoamerica, the clearest examples being the Zapotec capital of Monte Alban and Kaminal Juyú in Guatemala. Centuries later, long after Teotihuacan was abandoned c. 700 CE, cities of the Postclassic era followed the style of Teotihuacan construction, especially Tula, Tenochtitlan, and Chichén Itzá.

Many scientific advances were also achieved during this period. The Maya refined their calendar, script, and mathematics to their highest level of development. Writing came to be used throughout the Mayan area, although it was still regarded as a noble activity and practiced only by noble scribes, painters, and priests. Using a similar system of writing, other cultures developed their own scripts, the most notable examples being those of the Ñuiñe culture and the Zapotecs of Oaxaca, although the Mayan system was the only fully developed writing system in Precolumbian America. Astronomy remained a matter of vital significance because of its importance for agriculture, the economic basis of Mesoamerican society, and to predict events in the future such as lunar and solar eclipses, an important feature for the rulers, proving to the commoners their links with the heavenly world.

The Middle Classic period ended in Northern Mesoamerica with the decline of Teotihuacan. This allowed other regional power centers to flourish and compete for control of trade routes and natural resources. In this way the late Classic era commenced. Political fragmentation during this era meant no city had complete hegemony. Various population movements occurred, caused by the incursion of groups from Aridoamerica and other northern regions, who pushed the older populations of Mesoamerica south. Among these new groups were the Nahua, who would later found the cities of Tula and Tenochtitlan, the two most important capitals of the Postclassic era. In addition, southern peoples established themselves in the center of Mexico, including the Olmec-Xicalanca, who came from the Yucatán Peninsula and founded Cacaxtla and Xochicalco.

In the Maya region, Tikal, an ally of Teotihuacan, experienced a decline, the so-called Tikal Hiatus, after being defeated by Dos Pilas, and Caracol, ally of Calakmul, lasted about another 100 years. During this hiatus, the cities of Dos Pilas, Piedras Negras, Caracol, Calakmul, Palenque, Copán, and Yaxchilán were consolidated. These and other city-states of the region found themselves involved in bloody wars with changing alliances, until Tikal defeated, in order, Dos Pilas, Caracol, with the help of Yaxha and El Naranjo, Waka, Calakmul&#x27;s last ally, and finally Calakmul itself, an event that took place in 732 with the sacrifice of Yuknom Cheen&#x27;s son in Tikal. That led to construction of monumental architecture in Tikal, from 740 to 810; the last date documented there was 899. The ruin of the Classic Maya civilization in the northern lowlands, begun at La Passion states such as Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Ceibal and Cancuén, c. 760, followed by the Usumacinta system cities of Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras, and Palenque, following a path from south to north.

Toward the end of the late Classic period, the Maya stopped recording the years using the Long Count calendar, and many of their cities were burned and abandoned to the jungle. Meanwhile, in the Southern Highlands, Kaminal Juyú continued its growth until 1200. In Oaxaca, Monte Alban reached its apex c. 750 and finally succumbed toward the end of the 9th century for reasons that are still unclear. Its fate was not much different from that of other cities such as La Quemada in the north and Teotihuacan in the center: it was burned and abandoned. In the last century of the Classic era, hegemony in the valley of Oaxaca passed to Lambityeco, several kilometers to the east.

====Teotihuacan====

Teotihuacan (&quot;The City of the Gods&quot; in Nahuatl) originated toward the end of the Preclassic period, c. 100 CE. Very little is known about its founders, but it is believed that the Otomí had an important role in the city&#x27;s development, as they did in the ancient culture of the Valley of Mexico, represented by Tlatilco. Teotihuacan initially competed with Cuicuilco for hegemony in the area. In this political and economic battle, Teotihuacan was aided by its control of the obsidian deposits in the Navaja mountains in Hidalgo. The decline of Cuicuilco is still a mystery, but it is known that a large part of the former inhabitants resettled in Teotihuacan some years before the eruption of Xitle, which covered the southern town in lava.

Once free of competition in the area of the Lake of Mexico, Teotihuacan experienced an expansion phase that made it one of the largest cities of its time, not just in Mesoamerica but in the entire world. During this period of growth, it attracted the vast majority of those then living in the Valley of Mexico.

Teotihuacan was completely dependent on agricultural activity, primarily the cultivation of maize, beans, and squash, the Mesoamerican agricultural trinity. However, its political and economic hegemony was based on outside goods for which it enjoyed a monopoly: Anaranjado ceramics, produced in the Poblano–Tlaxcalteca valley, and the mineral deposits of the Hidalgan mountains. Both were highly valued throughout Mesoamerica and were exchanged for luxury merchandise of the highest caliber, from places as far away as New Mexico and Guatemala. Because of this, Teotihuacan became the hub of the Mesoamerican trade network. Its partners were Monte Albán and Tikal in the southeast, Matacapan on the Gulf coast, Altavista in the north, and Tingambato in the west.

Teotihuacan refined the Mesoamerican pantheon of deities, whose origins dated from the time of the Olmec. Of special importance were the worship of Quetzalcoatl and Tláloc, agricultural deities. Trade links promoted the spread of these cults to other Mesoamerican societies, who took and transformed them. It was thought that Teotihuacan society had no knowledge of writing, but as Duverger demonstrates, the writing system of Teotihuacan was extremely pictographic, to the point that writing was confused with drawing.

The fall of Teotihuacan is associated with the emergence of city-states within the confines of the central area of Mexico. It is thought that these were able to flourish due to the decline of Teotihuacan, though events may have occurred in the opposite order: the cities of Cacaxtla, Xochicalco, Teotenango, and El Tajín may have first increased in power and then were able to economically strangle Teotihuacan, trapped as it was in the center of the valley without access to trade routes. This occurred around 600 CE, and even though people continued to live there for another century and a half, the city was eventually destroyed and abandoned by its inhabitants, who took refuge in places such as Culhuacán and Azcapotzalco, on the shores of Lake Texcoco.

====The Maya in the Classic period====

The Maya created one of the most developed and best-known Mesoamerican cultures. Although authors such as Michael D. Coe believe that the Maya culture is completely different from the surrounding cultures, many elements present in Maya culture are shared by the rest of Mesoamerica, including the use of two calendars, the base 20 number system, the cultivation of corn, human sacrifice, and certain myths, such as that of the fifth sun and cultic worship, including that of the Feathered Serpent and the rain god, who in the Yucatec Maya language is called Chaac.

The beginnings of Maya culture date from the development of Kaminaljuyu, in the Highlands of Guatemala, during the middle Preclassic period. According to Richard D. Hansen and others researchers, the first true political states in Mesoamerica consisted of Takalik Abaj, in the Pacific Lowlands, and the cities of El Mirador, Nakbe, Cival and San Bartolo, among others, in the Mirador Basin and Peten. Archaeologists believe that this development happened centuries later, around the 1st century BCE, but recent research in the Petén basin and Belize have proven them wrong. The archaeological evidence indicates that the Maya never formed a united empire; they were instead organized into small chiefdoms that were constantly at war. López Austin and López Luján have said that the Preclassic Maya were characterized by their bellicose nature. They probably had a greater mastery of the art of war than Teotihuacan, yet the idea that they were a peaceful society given to religious contemplation, which persists to this day, was particularly promoted by early- and mid-20th century Mayanists such as Sylvanus G. Morley and J. Eric S. Thompson. Confirmation that the Maya practiced human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism came much later (e.g. by the murals of Bonampak).

Writing and the Maya calendar were quite early developments in the great Maya cities, c. 1000 BCE, and some of the oldest commemorative monuments are from sites in the Maya region. Archaeologists once thought that the Maya sites functioned only as ceremonial centers and that the common people lived in the surrounding villages. However, more recent excavations indicate the Maya sites enjoyed urban services as extensive as those of Tikal, believed to be as large as 400,000 inhabitants at its peak, circa 750, Copan, and others. Drainage, aqueducts, and pavement, or Sakbe, meaning &quot;white road&quot;, united major centers since the Preclassic. The construction of these sites was carried out on the basis of a highly stratified society, dominated by the noble class, who at the same time were the political, military, and religious elite.

The elite controlled agriculture, practiced by means of mixed systems of ground-clearing, and intensive platforms around the cities. As in the rest of Mesoamerica, they imposed on the lowest classes taxes—in kind or in labor—that permitted them to concentrate sufficient resources for the construction of public monuments, which legitimized the power of the elites and the social hierarchy. During the Early Classic Period, c. 370, the Maya political elite sustained strong ties to Teotihuacan, and it is possible that Tikal may have been an important ally of Teotihuacan that controlled commerce with the Gulf coast and highlands. Finally, it seems the great drought that ravaged Central America in the 9th century, internal wars, ecological disasters, and famine destroyed the Maya political system, which led to popular uprisings and the defeat of the dominant political groups. Many cities were abandoned, remaining unknown until the 19th century, when descendants of the Maya led a group of European and American archaeologists to these cities, which had been swallowed over the centuries by the jungle.

===Postclassic period===

The Postclassic period is the time between the year 900 and the conquest of Mesoamerica by the Spaniards, which occurred between 1521 and 1697. It was a period in which military activity became of great importance. The political elites associated with the priestly class were relieved of power by groups of warriors. In turn, at least a half-century before the arrival of the Spaniards, the warrior class was yielding its positions of privilege to a very powerful group that was unconnected to the nobility: the &quot;pochtecas&quot;, merchants who obtained great political power by virtue of their economic power.

The Postclassic period is divided into two phases. The first is the early Postclassic, which includes the 10th to the 13th century, and is characterized by the Toltec hegemony of Tula. The 12th century marks the beginning of the late Postclassic period, which begins with the arrival of the Chichimec, linguistically related to the Toltecs and the Mexica, who established themselves in the Valley of Mexico in 1325, following a two-century pilgrimage from Aztlán, the exact location of which is unknown. Many of the social changes of this final period of Mesoamerican civilization are related to the migratory movements of the northern peoples. These peoples came from Oasisamerica, Aridoamerica, and the northern region of Mesoamerica, driven by climate changes that threatened their survival. The migrations from the north caused, in turn, the displacement of peoples who had been rooted in Mesoamerica for centuries; some of them left for Centroamerica.

There were many cultural changes during that time. One of them was the expansion of metallurgy, imported from South America, and whose oldest remnants in Mesoamerica come from the West, as is the case also with ceramics. The Mesoamericans did not achieve great facility with metals; in fact, their use was rather limited (a few copper axes, needles, and above all jewelry). The most advanced techniques of Mesoamerican metallurgy were developed by the Mixtec, who produced fine, exquisitely handcrafted articles. Remarkable advances were made in architecture as well. The use of nails in architecture was introduced to support the sidings of the temples, the mortar was improved, and the use of columns and stone roofs was widespread—something that only the Maya had used during the Classic period. In agriculture, the system of irrigation became more complex; in the Valley of Mexico especially, chinampas were used extensively by the Mexica, who built a city of 200,000 around them.
The political system also underwent important changes. During the early Postclassic period, the warlike political elites legitimized their position by means of their adherence to a complex set of religious beliefs that López Austin called &quot;zuyuanidad&quot;. According to this system, the ruling classes proclaimed themselves the descendants of Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Serpent, one of the creative forces, and a cultural hero in Mesoamerican mythology. They likewise declared themselves the heirs of a no less mythical city, called Tollan in Nahuatl, and Zuyuá in Maya (from which López Austin derives the name for the belief system). Many of the important capitals of the time identified themselves with this name (for example, Tollan Xicocotitlan, Tollan Chollollan, Tollan Teotihuacan). The Tollan of myth was for a long time identified with Tula, in Hidalgo state, but Enrique Florescano and López Austin have claimed that this has no basis. Florescano states that the mythical Tollan was Teotihuacan; López Austin argues that Tollan was simply a product of the Mesoamerican religious imagination. Another feature of the &quot;zuyuano&quot; system was the formation of alliances with other city-states that were controlled by groups having the same ideology; such was the case with the League of Mayapan in Yucatán, and the Mixtec confederation of Lord Eight Deer, based in the mountains of Oaxaca. These early Postclassic societies can be characterized by their military nature and multi-ethnic populations.
However, the fall of Tula checked the power of the &quot;zuyuano&quot; system, which finally broke down with the dissolution of the League of Mayapán, the Mixtec state, and the abandonment of Tula. Mesoamerica received new immigrants from the north, and although these groups were related to the ancient Toltecs, they had a completely different ideology than the existing residents. The final arrivals were the Mexica, who established themselves on a small island on Lake Texcoco under the dominion of the Texpanecs of Azcapotzalco. This group would, in the following decades, conquer a large part of Mesoamerica, creating a united and centralized state whose only rivals were the Purépecha Empire of Michoacán. Neither one of them could defeat the other, and it seems that a type of non-aggression pact was established between the two peoples. When the Spaniards arrived many of the peoples controlled by the Mexica no longer wished to continue under their rule. Therefore, they took advantage of the opportunity presented by the Europeans, agreeing to support them, thinking that in return they would gain their freedom, and not knowing that this would lead to the subjugation of all of the Mesoamerican world.

====Aztec====
Of all prehispanic Mesoamerican cultures, the best-known is the Mexica of the city-state of Tenochtitlan, also known as the Aztecs. The Aztec Empire dominated central Mexico for close to a century before the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire (1519–1521).

The Mexica people came from the north or the west of Mesoamerica. The Nayaritas believed that the mythic Aztlán was located on the island of Mexcaltitán. Some hypothesize that this mythical island could have been located somewhere in the state of the Zacatecas, and it has even been proposed that it was as far north as New Mexico. Whatever the case, they were probably not far removed from the classic Mesoamerican tradition. In fact, they shared many characteristics with the people of central Mesoamerica. The Mexicas spoke Nahuatl, the same language spoken by the Toltecs and the Chichimecs who came before them.

The date of the departure from Aztlán is debated, with suggested dates of 1064, 1111, and 1168. After much wandering, the Mexicas arrived at the basin of the Valley of Mexico in the 14th century. They established themselves at various points along the bank of the river (for example, Culhuacán and Tizapán), before settling on the Islet of Mexico, protected by Tezozómoc, king of the Texpanecas. The city of Tenochtitlan was founded in 1325 as an ally of Azcapotzalco, but less than a century later, in 1430, the Mexicas joined with Texcoco and Tlacopan to wage war against Azcapotzalco and emerged victoriously. This gave birth to the Triple Alliance that replaced the ancient confederation ruled by the Tecpanecas (which included Coatlinchan and Culhuacán).

In the earliest days of the Triple Alliance, the Mexica initiated an expansionist phase that led them to control a good part of Mesoamerica. During this time only a few regions retained their independence: Tlaxcala (Nahua), Meztitlán (Otomí), Teotitlán del Camino (Cuicatec), Tututepec (Mixtec), Tehuantepec (Zapotec), and the northwest (ruled at that time by their rivals, the Tarascans). The provinces controlled by the Triple Alliance were forced to pay a tribute to Tenochtitlan; these payments are recorded in another codex known as the Matrícula de Los tributos (Registry of Tribute). This document specifies the quantity and type of every item that each province had to pay to the Mexicas.

The Mexica state was conquered by the Spanish forces of Hernán Cortés and their Tlaxcalan and Totonac allies in 1521. The defeat of Mesoamerica was complete when, in 1697, Tayasal was burned and razed by the Spanish.

==Postconquest era==

===Colonial Period, 1521–1821===

With the destruction of the superstructure of the Aztec Empire in 1521, central Mexico was brought under the control of the Spanish Empire. Over the course of the succeeding decades, virtually all of Mesoamerica was brought under Spanish control, which resulted in a fairly uniform policies toward indigenous populations. Spaniards&#x27; established the fallen Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan as Mexico City, the seat of government for the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The great initial project for Spanish conquerors was converting the indigenous peoples to Christianity, the only permitted religion. This endeavor was undertaken by Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustinian friars immediately after conquest. Divvying up of the spoils of the war was of key interest to the Spanish conquerors. The major ongoing benefit to conquerors after the obvious material plunder was to appropriate the existing system of tribute and obligatory labor to the Spanish victors.

This was done by the establishment of the &quot;encomienda&quot;, which awarded the tribute and labor from individual indigenous polities to particular Spanish conquerors. In that way, the economic and political arrangements at the level of the indigenous community were largely kept intact. The indigenous polity (&quot;altepetl&quot;) in the Nahua area, &quot;cah&quot; in the Maya region was the key to cultural survival of indigenous under Spanish rule, while at the same time also providing the structure for their economic exploitation. Spaniards classified all indigenous peoples as &quot;Indians&quot; (&quot;indios&quot;), a term that the indigenous peoples never embraced. They were classified legally as being under the jurisdiction of the &quot;República de Indios&quot;. They were legally separated from the &quot;República de Españoles&quot;, which comprised Europeans, Africans, and mixed-race castas. In general, indigenous communities in Mesoamerica kept much of their prehispanic social and political structures, with indigenous elites continuing to function as leaders in their communities. These elites acted as intermediaries with the Spanish crown, so long as they remained loyal. There were significant changes in Mesoamerican communities during the colonial era, but during the entire colonial period Mesoamericans were the largest single non-Hispanic group in the colonial Mexico, far larger than the entire Hispanic sphere. Although the Spanish colonial system imposed many changes on Mesoamerican peoples, they did not force the acquisition of Spanish and Mesoamerican languages continued to flourish to the present day.

===Postcolonial Period, 1821–present===

Mexico and Central America became independent from Spain in 1821, with some participation of indigenous in decade-long political struggles, but for their own motivations. With the fall of colonial government, the Mexican state abolished distinctions between ethnic groups, that is the separate governance for indigenous populations in the &quot;República de Indios&quot;. The new sovereign country made, in theory at least, all Mexicans citizens of the independent nation-state rather than vassals of the Spanish crown, with different legal standing. A long period of political chaos in the post-independence period among white elites largely did not affect indigenous peoples and their communities. Mexican conservatives were largely in charge of the national government and kept in place practices from the old colonial order. 

However, in the 1850s, Mexican liberals gained power and attempted to formulate and implement reforms that did affect indigenous communities, as well as the Catholic Church. The Mexican Constitution of 1857 abolished the ability of corporations to hold land, which aimed at taking assets out of the hands of the Catholic Church in Mexico and forcing indigenous communities to divide their community-held lands. Liberals&#x27; aimed at turning indigenous community members pursuing subsistence farming into yeoman farmers holding their own land. Mexican conservatives repudiated the liberal reform laws since they attacked the Catholic Church, but indigenous communities also participated in a three-year civil war. 

In the late nineteenth century, liberal army general Porfirio Díaz, a Mestizo did much for modernizing Mexico and integrating it into the world economy, but there were renewed pressures on indigenous communities and their lands. These exploded in certain areas of Mexico during the ten-year long civil war, the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920). In the aftermath of the Revolution, the Mexican government attempted simultaneously shore up indigenous culture, while at the same time also attempting to integrate the indigenous as citizens of the nation, turning indigenous into peasants (&quot;campesinos&quot;). This has proved more difficult than policy planners imagined, with resilient indigenous communities continuing to struggle for rights within the nation.

<text>Botolph Claydon is a hamlet in the civil parish of East Claydon, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is situated about east of Bicester in Oxfordshire, and north west of Aylesbury.

Anciently the hamlet was called Botyl Claydon. The prefix comes from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;botyl&quot; meaning &#x27;house&#x27;. The word Claydon is also Anglo Saxon, and means &#x27;clay hill&#x27;.
The village hall, built in 1912, was once the village library and was donated to the villages of East and Botolph Claydon by the Verney Family.

<doc id="399230" wikidata="Q1649527" url="?curid=399230" title="Emir of Qatar">
<text>The Emir of the State of [[Qatar]] () is the monarch and head of state of the country. The emir is also the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces and guarantor of the Constitution. The emir holds the most powerful position in the country, and has a prominent role in foreign relations. 

The emirs are members of the House of Al Thani, whose origins are in the Banu Tamim, one of the largest tribes in the Arabian Peninsula. The present ruler is Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who succeeded on 25 June 2013.

==Historical background==
There have been eight rulers of Qatar, all members of the Al Thani family. Sheikh Mohammed bin Thani is recognised as the first ruler from 1851 when he achieved union of the country&#x27;s tribes under his leadership.

Qatar became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1871, although Sheikh Mohammed retained control of its internal affairs. Following his army&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Al Wajbah in March 1893, the second ruler Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani has been recognised as Founder of the State of Qatar, although it remained part of the Ottoman Empire until July 1913.

The Ottomans maintained a military presence in Qatar until August 1915 and Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani signed the Anglo-Qatari Treaty on 3 November 1916. Sheikh Abdullah was the Qatari ruler from 1913 to 1949 and is one of the few, including Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, whose tenure extended through both world wars (1914–1945). Qatar&#x27;s first oil well was drilled in October 1938 and oil was found at Dukhan in January 1940.

Qatar became an independent state on 3 September 1971 and, since then, the ruler has been styled emir (amir).

==Succession==
The permanent constitution of the state of Qatar published in 2005 dictates that the rule is hereditary and limited to descendants of Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. The order of succession in Qatar is determined by appointments within the House of Al Thani.

The former emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani (), appointed his fourth son, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani (), as heir apparent on 5 August 2003, after his older son Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani (who held the position between 1996 and 2003) renounced his rights to the throne in favour of Sheikh Tamim.

==Career==
Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Qatar Armed Forces upon graduation from Sandhurst. He became the heir apparent to the Qatar throne on 5 August 2003, when his elder brother Sheikh Jassim renounced his claim to the title. Since then he was groomed to take over rule, working in top security and economics posts. On 5 August 2003, he was appointed deputy commander-in-chief of Qatar&#x27;s armed forces. Sheikh Tamim promoted sport as part of Qatar&#x27;s bid to raise its international profile. In 2005 he founded Oryx Qatar Sports Investments, which owns Paris Saint-Germain F.C. among other investments.

<doc id="399231" wikidata="Q326921" url="?curid=399231" title="Concussion">
<text>A concussion, also known as a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a head injury that temporarily affects brain functioning. Symptoms may include headache, dizziness, difficulty with thinking and concentration, sleep disturbances, mood changes, a brief period of memory loss, brief loss of consciousness; problems with balance; nausea; blurred vision; and mood changes. Concussion should be suspected if a person indirectly or directly hits their head and experiences any of the symptoms of concussion. Symptoms of a concussion may be delayed by 1–2 days after the accident. It is not unusual for symptoms to last 2 weeks in adults and 4 weeks in children. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.
Common causes include motor vehicle collisions, falls, sports injuries, and bicycle accidents. Risk factors include physical violence, drinking alcohol and a prior history of concussion. The mechanism of injury involves either a direct blow to the head or forces elsewhere on the body that are transmitted to the head. This is believed to result in neuron dysfunction, as there are increased glucose requirements, but not enough blood supply. A thorough evaluation by a qualified medical provider working in their scope of practice (such as a physician or nurse practitioner) is required to rule out life-threatening head injuries, injuries to the cervical spine, and neurological conditions and to use information obtained from the medical evaluation to diagnose a concussion. Glasgow coma scale score 13 to 15, loss of consciousness for less than 30 minutes, and memory loss for less than 24 hours may be used to rule out moderate or severe traumatic brain injuries. Diagnostic imaging such as a CT scan or an MRI may be required to rule out severe head injuries. Routine imaging is not required to diagnose concussion.
Prevention of concussion approaches includes the use of a helmet and mouth guard for certain sporting activities, seatbelt use in motor vehicles, following rules and policies on body checking and body contact in organized sport, and neuromuscular training warm-up exercises. Treatment of concussion includes relative rest for no more than 1–2 days, aerobic exercise to increase the heart rate and gradual step-wise return to activities, school, and work. Prolonged periods of rest may slow recovery and result in greater depression and anxiety. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or NSAIDs may be recommended to help with a headache. Prescribed aerobic exercise may improve recovery. Physiotherapy may be useful for persisting balance problems, headache, or whiplash; cognitive behavioral therapy may be useful for mood changes and sleep problems. Evidence to support the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and chiropractic therapy is lacking.
Worldwide, concussions are estimated to affect more than 3.5 per 1,000 people a year. Concussions are classified as mild traumatic brain injuries and are the most common type of TBIs. Males and young adults are most commonly affected. Outcomes are generally good. Another concussion before the symptoms of a prior concussion have resolved is associated with worse outcomes. Repeated concussions may also increase the risk in later life of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and depression.
==Signs and symptoms==
Concussion symptoms vary between people and include physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms. Symptoms may appear immediately or be delayed by 1–2 days. Delayed onset of symptoms may still be serious and require a medical assessment. Up to one-third of people with concussion experience longer or persisting concussion symptoms, also known as post concussion syndrome or persisting symptoms after concussion, which is defined as concussion symptoms lasting for 4 weeks or longer in children and adolescents, and symptoms lasting for more than 14 days in an adult. The severity of the initial symptoms is the strongest predictor of recovery time in adults.

===Physical===
Headaches are the most common mTBI symptom. Others include dizziness, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, difficulty balancing, or other problems with movement or sensation. Visual symptoms include light sensitivity, seeing bright lights, blurred vision, and double vision. Tinnitus, or a ringing in the ears, is also commonly reported. In one in about seventy concussions, concussive convulsions occur, but seizures that take place during or immediately after a concussion are not &quot;post-traumatic seizures&quot;, and, unlike post-traumatic seizures, are not predictive of post-traumatic epilepsy, which requires some form of structural brain damage, not just a momentary disruption in normal brain functioning. Concussive convulsions are thought to result from temporary loss or inhibition of motor function and are not associated either with epilepsy or with more serious structural damage. They are not associated with any particular sequelae and have the same high rate of favorable outcomes as concussions without convulsions.

===Cognitive and emotional===
Cognitive symptoms include confusion, disorientation, and difficulty focusing attention. Loss of consciousness may occur, but is not necessarily correlated with the severity of the concussion if it is brief. Post-traumatic amnesia, in which events following the injury cannot be recalled, is a hallmark of concussions. Confusion may be present immediately or may develop over several minutes. A person may repeat the same questions, be slow to respond to questions or directions, have a vacant stare, or have slurred or incoherent speech. Other concussion symptoms include changes in sleeping patterns and difficulty with reasoning, concentrating, and performing everyday activities.

A concussion can result in changes in mood including crankiness, loss of interest in favorite activities or items, tearfulness, and displays of emotion that are inappropriate to the situation. Common symptoms in concussed children include restlessness, lethargy, and irritability.

==Mechanism==
===Forces===
The brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which protects it from light trauma. More severe impacts, or the forces associated with rapid acceleration, may not be absorbed by this cushion. Concussions, and other head-related injuries, occur when external forces acting on the head are transferred to the brain. Such forces can occur when the head is struck by an object or surface (a &#x27;direct impact&#x27;), or when the torso rapidly changes position (i.e. from a body check) and force is transmitted to the head (an &#x27;indirect impact&#x27;).

Forces may cause linear, rotational, or angular movement of the brain or a combination of them. In rotational movement, the head turns around its center of gravity, and in angular movement, it turns on an axis, not through its center of gravity. The amount of rotational force is thought to be the major component in concussion and its severity. 
As of 2007, studies with athletes have shown that the amount of force and the location of the impact are not necessarily correlated with the severity of the concussion or its symptoms, and have called into question the threshold for concussion previously thought to exist at around 70–75 &quot;g&quot;.

The parts of the brain most affected by rotational forces are the midbrain and diencephalon. It is thought that the forces from the injury disrupt the normal cellular activities in the reticular activating system located in these areas and that this disruption produces the loss of consciousness often seen in concussion. Other areas of the brain that may be affected include the upper part of the brain stem, the fornix, the corpus callosum, the temporal lobe, and the frontal lobe. Angular accelerations of 4600, 5900, or 7900 rad/s2 are estimated to have 25, 50, or 80% risk of mTBI respectively.

===Pathophysiology===
In both animals and humans, mTBI can alter the brain&#x27;s physiology for hours to years, setting into motion a variety of pathological events. As one example, in animal models, after an initial increase in glucose metabolism, there is a subsequent reduced metabolic state which may persist for up to four weeks after injury. Though these events are thought to interfere with neuronal and brain function, the metabolic processes that follow concussion are reversible in a large majority of affected brain cells; however, a few cells may die after the injury.

Included in the cascade of events unleashed in the brain by concussion is impaired neurotransmission, loss of regulation of ions, deregulation of energy use and cellular metabolism, and a reduction in cerebral blood flow. Excitatory neurotransmitters, chemicals such as glutamate that serve to stimulate nerve cells, are released in excessive amounts. The resulting cellular excitation causes neurons to fire excessively. This creates an imbalance of ions such as potassium and calcium across the cell membranes of neurons (a process like excitotoxicity).

At the same time, cerebral blood flow is relatively reduced for unknown reasons, though the reduction in blood flow is not as severe as it is in ischemia. Thus cells get less glucose than they normally do, which causes an &quot;energy crisis&quot;.

Concurrently with these processes, the activity of mitochondria may be reduced, which causes cells to rely on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy, increasing levels of the byproduct lactate.

For a period of minutes to days after a concussion, the brain is especially vulnerable to changes in intracranial pressure, blood flow, and anoxia. According to studies performed on animals (which are not always applicable to humans), large numbers of neurons can die during this period in response to slight, normally innocuous changes in blood flow.

Concussion involves diffuse (as opposed to focal) brain injury, meaning that the dysfunction occurs over a widespread area of the brain rather than in a particular spot. It is thought to be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury, because axons may be injured to a minor extent due to stretching. Animal studies in which rodents were concussed have revealed lifelong neuropathological consequences such as ongoing axonal degeneration and neuroinflammation in subcortical white matter tracts. Axonal damage has been found in the brains of concussion patients who died from other causes, but inadequate blood flow to the brain due to other injuries may have contributed. Findings from a study of the brains of deceased NFL athletes who received concussions suggest that lasting damage is done by such injuries. This damage, the severity of which increases with the cumulative number of concussions sustained, can lead to a variety of other health issues.

The debate over whether concussion is a functional or structural phenomenon is ongoing. Structural damage has been found in the mildly traumatically injured brains of animals, but it is not clear whether these findings would apply to humans. Such changes in brain structure could be responsible for certain symptoms such as visual disturbances, but other sets of symptoms, especially those of a psychological nature, are more likely to be caused by reversible pathophysiological changes in cellular function that occur after concussion, such as alterations in neurons&#x27; biochemistry. These reversible changes could also explain why dysfunction is frequently temporary. A task force of head injury experts called the Concussion In Sport Group met in 2001 and decided that &quot;concussion may result in neuropathological changes but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than structural injury.&quot;

Using animal studies, the pathology of a concussion seems to start with mechanical shearing and stretching forces disrupting the cell membrane of nerve cells through &quot;mechanoporation&quot;. This results in potassium outflow from within the cell into the extracellular space with the subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters including glutamate which leads to enhanced potassium extrusion, in turn resulting in sustained depolarization, impaired nerve activity and potential nerve damage. Human studies have failed to identify changes in glutamate concentration immediately post-mTBI, though disruptions have been seen 3 days to 2 weeks post-injury. In an effort to restore ion balance, the sodium-potassium ion pumps increase activity, which results in excessive ATP (adenosine triphosphate) consumption and glucose utilization, quickly depleting glucose stores within the cells. Simultaneously, inefficient oxidative metabolism leads to anaerobic metabolism of glucose and increased lactate accumulation. There is a resultant local acidosis in the brain and increased cell membrane permeability, leading to local swelling. After this increase in glucose metabolism, there is a subsequent lower metabolic state which may persist for up to 4 weeks after injury. A completely separate pathway involves a large amount of calcium accumulating in cells, which may impair oxidative metabolism and begin further biochemical pathways that result in cell death. Again, both of these main pathways have been established from animal studies and the extent to which they apply to humans is still somewhat unclear.

==Diagnosis==
Head trauma recipients are initially assessed to exclude a more severe emergency such as an intracranial hemorrhage or other serious head or neck injuries. This includes the &quot;ABCs&quot; (airway, breathing, circulation) and stabilization of the cervical spine, which is assumed to be injured in any athlete who is found to be unconscious after head or neck injury. Indications that screening for more serious injury is needed include &#x27;red flag symptoms&#x27; or &#x27;concussion danger signs&#x27;: worsening headaches, persisting vomiting, increasing disorientation or a deteriorating level of consciousness, seizures, and unequal pupil size. Those with such symptoms, or those who are at higher risk of a more serious brain injury, require an emergency medical assessment. Brain imaging such as a CT scan or MRI may be suggested, but should be avoided unless there are progressive neurological symptoms, focal neurological findings, or concern of skull fracture on exam.

Diagnosis of concussion requires an assessment performed by a physician or nurse practitioner to rule out severe injuries to the brain and cervical spine, mental health conditions, or other medical conditions. Diagnosis is based on physical and neurological examination findings, duration of unconsciousness (usually less than 30 minutes) and post-traumatic amnesia (usually less than 24 hours), and the Glasgow Coma Scale (people with mTBI have scores of 13 to 15). A CT scan or MRI is not required to diagnose concussion. Neuropsychological tests such as the SCAT5/child SCAT5 may be suggested measure cognitive function. Such tests may be administered hours, days, or weeks after the injury, or at different times to demonstrate any trend. Some athletes are also being tested pre-season (pre-season baseline testing) to provide a baseline for comparison in the event of an injury, though this may not reduce risk or affect return to play and baseline testing is not required or suggested for most children and adults.

If the Glasgow coma scale is less than 15 at two hours or less than 14 at any time, a CT is recommended. In addition, a CT scan is more likely to be performed if observation after discharge is not assured or intoxication is present, there is suspected increased risk for bleeding, age greater than 60, or less than 16. Most concussions, without complication, cannot be detected with MRI or CT scans. However, changes have been reported on MRI and SPECT imaging in those with concussion and normal CT scans, and persisting concussion symptoms may be associated with abnormalities visible on SPECT and PET scans. Mild head injury may or may not produce abnormal EEG readings. A blood test known as the Brain Trauma Indicator was approved in the United States in 2018 and may be able to rule out the risk of intracranial bleeding and thus the need for a CT scan for adults.

Concussion may be under-diagnosed because of the lack of the highly noticeable signs and symptoms while athletes may minimize their injuries to remain in the competition. Direct impact to the head is not required for a concussion diagnosis, as other bodily impacts with a subsequent force transmission to the head are also causes. A retrospective survey in 2005 suggested that more than 88% of concussions are unrecognized. Particularly, many younger athletes struggle with identifying their concussions, which often result in the non-disclosure of concussions and consequently under-representing the incidence of concussions in the context of sport.

Diagnosis can be complex because concussion shares symptoms with other conditions. For example, persisting concussion symptoms such as cognitive problems may be misattributed to brain injury when, in fact, due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

There are no fluid biomarkers (i.e., blood or urine tests) that are validated for diagnosing concussion in children or adolescents.

===Classification===
No single definition of concussion, minor head injury, or mild traumatic brain injury is universally accepted. In 2001, the expert Concussion in Sport Group of the first International Symposium on Concussion in Sport defined concussion as &quot;a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by traumatic biomechanical forces.&quot; It was agreed that concussion typically involves temporary impairment of neurological function that heals by itself within time, and that neuroimaging normally shows no gross structural changes to the brain as the result of the condition.

However, although no structural brain damage occurs according to the classic definition, some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred, and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain&#x27;s synapses. Also, by definition, concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness. However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs. This debate resurfaces in some of the best-known concussion grading scales, in which those episodes involving loss of consciousness are graded as being more severe than those without.

Definitions of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) were inconsistent until the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) provided a consistent, authoritative definition across specialties in 1992. Since then, various organizations such as the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Psychiatric Association in its &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; have defined mTBI using some combination of loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, and the Glasgow Coma Scale.

Concussion falls under the classification of mild TBI, but it is not clear whether concussion is implied in mild brain injury or mild head injury. &quot;mTBI&quot; and &quot;concussion&quot; are often treated as synonyms in medical literature but other injuries such as intracranial hemorrhages (e.g. intra-axial hematoma, epidural hematoma, and subdural hematoma) are not necessarily precluded in mTBI or mild head injury, as they are in concussion. mTBI associated with abnormal neuroimaging may be considered &quot;complicated mTBI&quot;. &quot;Concussion&quot; can be considered to imply a state in which brain function is temporarily impaired and &quot;mTBI&quot; to imply a pathophysiological state, but in practice, few researchers and clinicians distinguish between the terms. Descriptions of the condition, including the severity and the area of the brain affected, are now used more often than &quot;concussion&quot; in clinical neurology.

==Prevention==

Prevention of mTBI involves general measures such as wearing seat belts, using airbags in cars, and protective equipment such as helmets for high-risk sports. Older people are encouraged to reduce fall risk by keeping floors free of clutter and wearing thin, flat shoes with hard soles that do not interfere with balance.

Protective equipment such as helmets and other headgear and policy changes such as the banning of body checking in youth hockey leagues have been found to reduce the number and severity of concussions in athletes. Secondary prevention such as a Return to Play Protocol for an athlete may reduce the risk of repeat concussions. New &quot;Head Impact Telemetry System&quot; technology is being placed in helmets to study injury mechanisms and may generate knowledge that will potentially help reduce the risk of concussions among American Football players. Mouth guards have been put forward as a preventative measure, and there is mixed evidence supporting its use in preventing concussions but rather has support in preventing dental trauma.

Educational interventions, such as handouts, videos, workshops, and lectures, can improve concussion knowledge of diverse groups, particularly youth athletes and coaches. Strong concussion knowledge may be associated with greater recognition of concussion symptoms, higher rates of concussion reporting behaviors, and reduced body checking-related penalties and injuries, thereby lowering risk of mTBI.

Due to the incidence of concussion in sport, younger athletes often do not disclose concussions and their symptoms. Common reasons for non-disclosure include a lack of awareness of the concussion, the belief that the concussion was not serious enough, and not wanting to leave the game or team due to their injury. Self-reported concussion rates among U-20 and elite rugby union players in Ireland are 45–48%, indicating that many concussions go unreported. Changes to the rules or enforcing existing rules in sports, such as those against &quot;head-down tackling&quot;, or &quot;spearing&quot;, which is associated with a high injury rate, may also prevent concussions.

==Treatment==
Adults and children with a suspected concussion require a medical assessment with a doctor or nurse practitioner to confirm the diagnosis of concussion and rule out more serious head injuries. After life-threatening head injuries, injuries to the cervical spine, and neurological conditions are ruled out, exclusion of neck or head injury, observation should be continued for several hours. If repeated vomiting, worsening headache, dizziness, seizure activity, excessive drowsiness, double vision, slurred speech, unsteady walk, or weakness or numbness in arms or legs, or signs of basilar skull fracture develop, immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed. Observation to monitor for worsening condition is an important part of treatment. While it is common advice that someone who is concussed should not be allowed to fall asleep in case they go into a coma, for general cases this is not supported by current evidence. People may be released after assessment from their primary care medical clinic, hospital, or emergency room to the care of a trusted person with instructions to return if they display worsening symptoms or those that might indicate an emergent condition (&quot;red flag symptoms&quot;) such as change in consciousness, convulsions, severe headache, extremity weakness, vomiting, new bleeding or deafness in either or both ears. Education about symptoms, their management, and their normal time course, may lead to an improved outcome. 

=== Rest and return to physical and cognitive activity ===
Physical and cognitive rest is recommended for the first 24–48 hours following a concussion after which injured persons should gradually start gentle low-risk physical and cognitive activities that do not make current symptoms worse or bring on new symptoms. Any activity for which there is a risk of contact, falling, or bumping the head should be avoided until the person has clearance from a doctor or nurse practitioner. Low-risk activities can be started even while a person has symptoms. Resting completely for longer than 24–48 hours following concussion has been shown to be associated with longer recovery.

=== Return-to-school ===
The resumption of low-risk school activities should begin as soon as the student feels ready and has completed an initial period of cognitive rest of no more than 24–48 hours following the acute injury. Long absences from school are not suggested, however; the return to school should be gradual and step-wise. Prolonged complete mental or physical rest (beyond 24–48 hours after the accident that lead to the concussion) may worsen outcomes, however, rushing back to full school work load before the person is ready, has also been associated with longer-lasting symptoms and an extended recovery time. Students with a suspected concussion are required to see a doctor for an initial medical assessment and for suggestions on recovery, however, medical clearance is not required for a student to return to school. Since students may appear &#x27;normal&#x27;, continuing education of relevant school personnel may be needed to ensure appropriate accommodations are made such as part-days and extended deadlines. Accommodations should be based on the monitoring of symptoms that are present during the return-to-school transition including headaches, dizziness, vision problems, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and abnormal behavior. Students must have completely resumed their school activities (without requiring concussion-related academic supports) before returning to full-contact or competitive sports.

=== Return-to-sport ===
For persons participating in athletics, it is suggested that participants progress through a series of graded steps. These steps include:
* Stage 1 (Immediately after injury): 24–48 hours (maximum) of relative physical and cognitive rest. This can include gentle daily activities such as walking in the house, gentle housework, and light school work that do not make symptoms worse. No sports activities.
* Stage 2: Light aerobic activity such as walking or stationary cycling
* Stage 3: Sport-specific activities such as running drills and skating drills
* Stage 4: Non-contact training drills (exercise, coordination, and cognitive load)
* Stage 5: Full-contact practice (requires medical clearance) 
* Stage 6: Return to full-contact sport or high-risk activities (requires medical clearance)

At each step, the person should not have worsening or new symptoms for at least 24 hours before progressing to the next. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms begin, athletes should drop back to the previous level for at least another 24 hours.

Intercollegiate or professional athletes, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.

=== Medications ===
Medications may be prescribed to treat headaches, sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen can be taken for headaches, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred to minimize the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.

About one percent of people who receive treatment for mTBI need surgery for a brain injury.

=== Return to work ===
Determining the ideal time for a person to return to work will depend on personal factors and job-related factors including the intensity of the job and the risk of falling or hitting one&#x27;s head at work during recovery. After the required initial recovery period of complete rest (24–48 hours after the concussion began), gradually and safely returning to the workplace with accommodations and support in place, should be prioritized over staying home and resting for long periods of time, to promote physical recovery and reduce the risk of people becoming socially isolated. The person should work with their employer to design a step-wise &quot;return-to-work&quot; plan. For those with a high-risk job, medical clearance may be required before resuming an activity that could lead to another head injury. Students should have completed the full return-to-school progression with no academic accommodations related to the concussion required before starting to return to part-time work.

==Prognosis==
The majority of children and adults fully recover from a concussion, however some may experience a prolonged recovery. There is no single physical test, blood test (or fluid biomarkers), or imaging test that can be used to determine when a person has fully recovered from concussion.

A person&#x27;s recovery may be influenced by a variety of factors that include age at the time of injury, intellectual abilities, family environment, social support system, occupational status, coping strategies, and financial circumstances. Factors such as a previous head injury or a coexisting medical condition have been found to predict longer-lasting persisting concussion symptoms. Other factors that may lengthen recovery time after mTBI include psychological problems such as substance abuse or clinical depression, poor health before the injury or additional injuries sustained during it, and life stress. Longer periods of amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the injury may indicate longer recovery times from residual symptoms. Other strong factors include participation in a contact sport and body mass size.

=== Pediatric concussion ===
Most children recover completely from concussion in less than four weeks, however 15–30% of youth may experience symptoms that last longer than a month.

=== People aged 65+ with concussion ===
Mild traumatic brain injury recovery time in people over age 65 may have increased complications due to elevated health concerns, or comorbidities. This often results in longer hospitalization duration, poorer cognitive outcomes, and higher mortality rates.

=== Repeat concussion ===
For unknown reasons, having had one concussion significantly increases a person&#x27;s risk of having another. Having previously sustained a sports concussion has been found to be a strong factor increasing the likelihood of a concussion in the future. People who have had a concussion seem more susceptible to another one, particularly if the new injury occurs before symptoms from the previous concussion have completely gone away. It is also a negative process if smaller impacts cause the same symptom severity. Repeated concussions may increase a person&#x27;s risk in later life for dementia, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and depression.

===Post-concussion syndrome===

In post-concussion syndrome, symptoms do not resolve for weeks, months, or years after a concussion, and may occasionally be permanent. About 10% to 20% of people have persisting concussion symptoms for more than a month. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, memory and attention problems, sleep problems, and irritability. Rest, a previously recommended recovery technique, has limited effectiveness. A recommended treatment in both children and adults with symptoms beyond 4 weeks involves an active rehabilitation program with reintroduction of non-contact aerobic activity. Progressive physical exercise has been shown to reduce long-term post-concussive symptoms. Symptoms usually go away on their own within months but may last for years. The question of whether the syndrome is due to structural damage or other factors such as psychological ones, or a combination of these, has long been the subject of debate.

===Cumulative effects===
As of 1999, cumulative effects of concussions were poorly understood, especially the effects on children. The severity of concussions and their symptoms may worsen with successive injuries, even if a subsequent injury occurs months or years after an initial one. Symptoms may be more severe and changes in neurophysiology can occur with the third and subsequent concussions. As of 2006, studies had conflicting findings on whether athletes have longer recovery times after repeat concussions and whether cumulative effects such as impairment in cognition and memory occur.

Cumulative effects may include chronic traumatic encephalopathy, psychiatric disorders and loss of long-term memory. For example, the risk of developing clinical depression has been found to be significantly greater for retired American football players with a history of three or more concussions than for those with no concussion history. An experience of three or more concussions is associated with a fivefold greater chance of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease earlier and a threefold greater chance of developing memory deficits.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or &quot;CTE&quot;, is an example of the cumulative damage that can occur as the result of multiple concussions or less severe blows to the head. The condition was previously referred to as &quot;dementia pugilistica&quot;, or &quot;punch drunk&quot; syndrome, as it was first noted in boxers. The disease can lead to cognitive and physical disabilities such as parkinsonism, speech and memory problems, slowed mental processing, tremor, depression, and inappropriate behavior. It shares features with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Second-impact syndrome===

Second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells dangerously after a minor blow, may occur in very rare cases. The condition may develop in people who receive a second blow days or weeks after an initial concussion before its symptoms have gone away. No one is certain of the cause of this often fatal complication, but it is commonly thought that the swelling occurs because the brain&#x27;s arterioles lose the ability to regulate their diameter, causing a loss of control over cerebral blood flow. As the brain swells, intracranial pressure rapidly rises. The brain can herniate, and the brain stem can fail within five minutes. Except in boxing, all cases have occurred in athletes under age 20. Due to the very small number of documented cases, the diagnosis is controversial, and doubt exists about its validity. A 2010 &quot;Pediatrics&quot; review article stated that there is debate whether the brain swelling is due to two separate hits or to just one hit, but in either case, catastrophic football head injuries are three times more likely in high school athletes than in college athletes.

==Epidemiology==

Most cases of traumatic brain injury are concussions. A World Health Organization (WHO) study estimated that between 70 and 90% of head injuries that receive treatment are mild. However, due to under reporting and to the widely varying definitions of concussion and mTBI, it is difficult to estimate how common the condition is. Estimates of the incidence of concussion may be artificially low, for example, due to under reporting. At least 25% of people with mTBI fail to get assessed by a medical professional. The WHO group reviewed studies on the epidemiology of mTBI and found a hospital treatment rate of 1–3 per 1000 people, but since not all concussions are treated in hospitals, they estimated that the rate per year in the general population is over 6 per 1000 people.

===Age===
Young children have the highest concussion rate among all age groups. However, most people with a concussion are young adults. A Canadian study found that the yearly incidence of mTBI is lower in older age groups (graph at right). Studies suggest males develop mTBI at about twice the rate of their female counterparts. However, female athletes may be at a higher risk of sustaining a concussion than their male counterparts.

===Sports===
Up to five percent of sports injuries are concussions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 300,000 sports-related concussions occur yearly in the U.S., but that number includes only athletes who lost consciousness. Since loss of consciousness is thought to occur in less than 10% of concussions, the CDC estimate is likely lower than the real number. Sports in which concussion is particularly common include American football, the rugby codes, MMA and boxing (a boxer aims to &quot;knock out&quot;, i.e. give a mild traumatic brain injury to, the opponent). The injury is so common in the latter that several medical groups have called for a ban on the sport, including the American Academy of Neurology, the World Medical Association, and the medical associations of the UK, the US, Australia, and Canada.

=== Workplace ===
Concussions may also be common and occur in the workplace. According to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, the most common causes of mTBI-related hospitalizations and deaths from the workplace are falls, force of heavy objects, and vehicular collisions. As a consequence, jobs in the construction, transportation, and natural resource industries (e.g. agriculture, fishing, mining) have more elevated mTBI incidence rates ranging from 10 to 20 cases per 100,000 workers. In particular, as vehicular collisions are the leading cause of workplace mTBI-related injuries, workers from the transportation sector often carry the most risk. Despite these findings, there still remain important gaps in data compilation on workplace-related mTBIs, which has raised questions about increased concussion surveillance and preventive measures in private industry.

==History==

The Hippocratic Corpus, a collection of medical works from ancient Greece, mentions concussion, later translated to &quot;commotio cerebri&quot;, and discusses loss of speech, hearing, and sight that can result from &quot;commotion of the brain&quot;. This idea of disruption of mental function by &quot;shaking of the brain&quot; remained the widely accepted understanding of concussion until the 19th century. In the 10th century, the Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi was the first to write about concussion as distinct from other types of head injury. He may have been the first to use the term &quot;cerebral concussion&quot;, and his definition of the condition, a transient loss of function with no physical damage, set the stage for the medical understanding of the condition for centuries.

In the 13th century, the physician Lanfranc of Milan&#x27;s &quot;Chiurgia Magna&quot; described concussion as brain &quot;commotion&quot;, also recognizing a difference between concussion and other types of traumatic brain injury (though many of his contemporaries did not), and discussing the transience of post-concussion symptoms as a result of temporary loss of function from the injury. In the 14th century, the surgeon Guy de Chauliac pointed out the relatively good prognosis of concussion as compared to more severe types of head trauma such as skull fractures and penetrating head trauma. In the 16th-century, the term &quot;concussion&quot; came into use, and symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and memory problems were described. The 16th century physician Ambroise Paré used the term &quot;commotio cerebri&quot;, as well as &quot;shaking of the brain&quot;, &quot;commotion&quot;, and &quot;concussion&quot;.
Until the 17th century, a concussion was usually described by its clinical features, but after the invention of the microscope, more physicians began exploring underlying physical and structural mechanisms. However, the prevailing view in the 17th century was that the injury did not result from physical damage, and this view continued to be widely held throughout the 18th century. The word &quot;concussion&quot; was used at the time to describe the state of unconsciousness and other functional problems that resulted from the impact, rather than a physiological condition. In 1839, Guillaume Dupuytren described brain contusions, which involve many small hemorrhages, as &quot;contusio cerebri&quot; and showed the difference between unconsciousness associated with damage to the brain parenchyma and that due to concussion, without such injury. In 1941, animal experiments showed that no macroscopic damage occurs in concussion.

==Society and culture==
===Costs===
Due to the lack of a consistent definition, the economic costs of mTBI are not known, but they are estimated to be very high. These high costs are due in part to the large percentage of hospital admissions for head injury that is due to mild head trauma, but indirect costs such as lost work time and early retirement account for the bulk of the costs. These direct and indirect costs cause the expense of mild brain trauma to rival that of moderate and severe head injuries.

===Terminology===
The terms mild brain injury, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), mild head injury (MHI), and concussion may be used interchangeably; although the term &quot;concussion&quot; is still used in sports literature as interchangeable with &quot;MHI&quot; or &quot;mTBI&quot;, the general clinical medical literature uses &quot;mTBI&quot; instead, since a 2003 CDC report outlined it as an important strategy. In this article, &quot;concussion&quot; and &quot;mTBI&quot; are used interchangeably.

The term &quot;concussion&quot; is from Latin &quot;concutere&quot;, &quot;to shake violently&quot; or &quot;concussus&quot;, &quot;action of striking together&quot;.

==Research==
Minocycline, lithium, and N-acetylcysteine show tentative success in animal models.

Measurement of predictive visual tracking is being studied as a screening technique to identify mild traumatic brain injury. A head-mounted display unit with eye-tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern for the person to follow with their eyes. People without brain injury will be able to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory while it is hypothesized that those with mild traumatic brain injury cannot.

=== Grading systems ===

National and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend a concussion grading system for use by medical professionals.

==== Historical information on grading systems ====
In the past, the decision to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on the grade of concussion. However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers&#x27; Association recommend against such use of these grading systems. Currently, injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests have returned to pre-injury levels.
Three grading systems have been most widely followed: by Robert Cantu, the Colorado Medical Society, and the American Academy of Neurology. Each employs three grades, as summarized in the following table:

At least 41 systems measure the severity, or grade, of a mild head injury, and there is little agreement about which is best. In an effort to simplify, the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a &#x27;simple&#x27; or &#x27;complex&#x27; classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days) and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents.

<doc id="399233" wikidata="Q2059003" url="?curid=399233" title="Bourne End, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Bourne End is a village mostly in the parish of Wooburn, but partly in that of Little Marlow in Buckinghamshire, England. It is about five miles (8 km) south-east of High Wycombe and three miles (5 km) east of Marlow, near the boundary with Berkshire and close to where the Buckinghamshire River Wye empties into the Thames.

==History==
Bourne End&#x27;s original location differed from today&#x27;s established village centre, and was a half-mile downstream on the River Thames. The name refers to the end of the river (&quot;bourne&quot; being an obsolete term for river), and derived from the mouth of the River Wye. Then a hamlet, it appears on Morden&#x27;s 1722 map of Buckinghamshire as &quot;Born end&quot;. It was noted in the 19th century, however, that the name had been corrupted to &quot;Bone End&quot;, apparently through local mispronunciation and thence on official maps and documents. In 1858, the vicar of Wooburn succeeded in reversing the change, and the corrected name remains in use today.

The length of the River Wye was the provider of water power for many mills in the valley for hundreds of years, and Bourne End was no exception. There were four on the final stretch of the river: Princes Mill, Jacksons (or Gunpowder) Mill, Hedsor Mill and Lower Mill. These mills were historically the predominant employers in the area, along with the local farms and two wharfs on the Thames.

In the early nineteenth century, the settlement known as Bourne End was a hamlet of Wooburn parish, along with others such as Spring Gardens, Eghams Green, Cores End, Heavens Lea and Upper Bourne End. This changed with the emergence of the Wycombe Railway Company in 1846. By 1854, Isambard Kingdom Brunel had designed and constructed a railway linking Maidenhead to High Wycombe, via Bourne End. The station at Bourne End was originally named Marlow Road; then in 1873 a branch line to Marlow was built, and a year later the station was renamed Bourne End station to avoid confusion with the new station at Marlow town. The railway created more travel opportunities for locals and greatly benefited the mills, and thus Bourne End expanded, on a greater scale than other similar settlements in the surrounding area. &quot;See Marlow Branch Line and Marlow Donkey for more information.&quot;
The hamlets soon merged into what is now known as Bourne End, as did Well End and Coldmoorholme (or Coldmoorholm, formerly &quot;Coldmoorham&quot; or &quot;Coldmorham&quot;) in the neighbouring parish of Little Marlow. Locally, the area of Coldmoorholm is known as &#x27;Spade Oak&#x27;. Both a church and school were built at the turn of the century for the residents&#x27; convenience. The Parade became established as the focal point of the village for shops and services.

In the 1920s Bourne End became home for two distinguished literary figures; Enid Blyton, a perennially popular children&#x27;s writer, moved into Old Thatch on Coldmoorholme Lane, and Edgar Wallace, a prolific crime author and dramatist, bought Chalklands off Blind Lane. Another resident at this time was Louis Blériot, the French aviator and aircraft builder, who lived at New York Lodge beside the Thames.

The Royalty Cinema opened in The Parade in 1934. The late 1940s saw extensive development in Bourne End, of the Chalklands estate and the Council Estate north of The Parade. The 1960s saw the building of the Community Centre and Library in Wakeman Road after some years of local campaigning.

The Beeching Axe hit the village in 1969, as it was announced that the line between Bourne End and High Wycombe, which had suffered reduced usage after the direct connection between Wycombe and London by the opening of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway in 1899, would be closed. The track bed was lifted soon after closure in 1970. A commercial estate was developed adjacent to the station, though most of the course taken by the railway remains as a footpath between the village and Wooburn.

==Geography==
===Locale===
Bourne End lies between the M4 and M40 motorways, and retains its railway station on the Maidenhead to Marlow Branch Line. With rail and road accessibility to London, it has become a popular place for commuters to live.

All of the mills along the Wye Valley have now been shut down and demolished, Jacksons Mill in Furlong Road being the last (in Bourne End) in the late 1980s. These have been replaced by houses, offices or industrial estates, which has led to the continuation of the village as an employment centre.

Bourne End remains a distinct settlement, although the continued house-building over the past century means it is threatened by the evident ribbon development, through to High Wycombe. In 1997, when the Local Plan was in preparation, the Residents Associations of Bourne End and Wooburn successfully lobbied to stop Slate Meadow (the field which separates the two settlements) being designated for housing for the time being. Other undeveloped land around the village looks likely to remain so, as it has been specified as Green Belt, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, or a combination of the three. In parts, Bourne End is surrounded by farmland. Somewhat further away, Cliveden and Hedsor overlook the village from higher ground to the south east.

===Community===
Bourne End sustains many businesses and services whilst still retaining a village atmosphere. There is a Community Centre in the centre of the village, with a large hall, function rooms and a bar, which is open for member&#x27;s use. It is, for many, considered the focal point of village activity.

In the early 2000s, a Twinning Association was established, and subsequently Octeville-sur-Mer, a town on the north coast of France, was chosen to be its twin town. Frequent events are held by members of the association to foster and enhance the relationship between the two settlements.

===Administration and services===
The local government of the village is made up of two tiers. Wooburn and Bourne End Parish Council (formerly Wooburn Parish Council, until 2005), based in Wooburn; and Buckinghamshire County Council, based in Aylesbury which was established as a unitary authority in 2020. The local police force is Thames Valley Police. Local healthcare services are commissioned by Buckinghamshire Primary Care Trust (PCT); GPs operate from The Hawthornden Surgery in Wharf Lane, and The Orchard Surgery in Station Road. Pound House Surgery at Wooburn Green is part of the same group of practices and nurses and other medical staff operate between all three. There are two dentists, the Bourne End Dental Practice, and Advance Dental Services, both in Station Road.

==Leisure==

The village has two recreation grounds (Furlong Road and Blind Lane), riverside open space at the marina and Spade Oak Reach, a Junior Sports Club and fitness centre and the long-established Upper Thames Sailing Club. For many residents and visitors alike, the river is the central attraction of Bourne End, and many leisure pursuits involve or revolve around it. The Sailing Club traditionally host a week-long regatta every year in June, known as &quot;Bourne End Week&quot;.

Bourne End hosts a number of restaurants of varying cuisines. There are also a number of public houses.

Near Bourne End, across the River Thames, is Cock Marsh, an area of common land and floodplain owned by the National Trust. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and includes a prehistoric burial mound. Cock Marsh is accessible via the footbridge attached to the railway bridge over the river, and footpaths continue to Cookham, Cookham Dean and beyond.

The Thames Path National Trail follows the River Thames through Bourne End; upstream on the Buckinghamshire side, crossing the river at the footbridge, and downstream through Berkshire.

==Education==
Bourne End has three schools:
*Westfield School, on Highfield Road, a special school which was the village First School until 1995.
*Claytons Primary School, in Wendover Road, the village junior school which was formerly a Middle School and was merged with Westfield.
*Bourne End Academy, in New Road, an upper school which has specialist Sports College status. Before its amalgamation with Pembroke School, Flackwell Heath, in 1985, this was known as Deyncourt School, and subsequently as Wye Valley School until 2014. From late 2012 to late 2014, the school was suffering from poor results in OFSTED evaluations, and was ultimately placed into Special Measures and given the academy status.

There are a number of pre-schools and nurseries across the village.

==Religion==
The village currently has three active churches. The Anglican parish church, in Station Road, is dedicated to St Mark. It was built in 1889 as a daughter church of St Paul&#x27;s, Wooburn. The Roman Catholic church of St Dunstan is in the centre of the village, off Cores End Road. The longest established is the United Reformed Church in Cores End, which was founded as a Congregational Chapel in 1773, as a nonconformist alternative to St Paul&#x27;s in Wooburn.

Bourne End had a Methodist Church in Furlong Road, which closed in 2002. Well End once had a Congregational mission hall, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; this is now a residential house named The Chapel.

Bourne End also has the only UK branch of the Ramakrishna Mission, Ramakrishna Vedanta centre .

==Shopping==
Bourne End continues to support a bustling array of shops, chiefly in The Parade. Community events focused on the village centre, such as &quot;Fun Night&quot; in December, have attempted to turn residents&#x27; attention to upholding local trade and businesses. There is a small parade of shops in Furlong Road, including the main Post Office.

<doc id="399238" wikidata="Q1215896" url="?curid=399238" title="Winterbourne, Gloucestershire">
<text>Winterbourne is a large village and civil parish in the South Gloucestershire district, in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England, lying just beyond the north fringe of Bristol. The parish of Winterbourne is centred on the village and includes the neighbouring communities of Winterbourne Down, Whiteshill, Hambrook, Frenchay and Watley&#x27;s End. To the north-east is the village of Frampton Cotterell and to the west lies the town of Bradley Stoke. The parish had a population of 10,250 at the 2021 census.

== History ==
Winterbourne was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Wintreborne&quot;, meaning &#x27;Winter Stream&#x27;. The village is believed to have derived its name from the nearby Bradley Brook, as much of medieval Winterbourne was originally built up around St Michael&#x27;s Church, which stands near the river.

The modern village is largely built on top of a hill, with woodlands and fields encompassing its urban features. The River Frome flows through a valley between the village and nearby Frampton Cotterell, continuing on towards Frenchay, and eventually draining via Mylne&#x27;s Culvert, into the tidal Bristol Avon New Cut, to the east of what is now Gaol Ferry Bridge. The Bradley Brook divides Winterbourne from Bradley Stoke and Stoke Gifford to the west, before flowing into the Frome at Hambrook. Since the 1960s, the M4 motorway has bypassed the village to the southwest.


The Huckford Viaduct carries the Great Western Railway over the River Frome. Beneath the viaduct is the abandoned Huckford Quarry, a public nature reserve. Winterbourne is known for its large duck pond, which overlooks the Frome Valley and is a common spot for fishing and feeding the ducks and swans.

The parish church is St Michael&#x27;s, a building dating from the 12th century, which celebrated its 800th anniversary in 1998. St Michael&#x27;s sits amid fields, flanked by cottages, with its prominent spire visible for miles around. At the altar is a stone depiction of the &quot;Last Supper&quot;, based on the painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Winterbourne Court Farm Barn is immediately adjacent to the church. This is a Grade II* listed 14th century tithe barn and is an outstanding example of its type.

== Amenities ==
Winterbourne has a number of pubs including the George and Dragon, the Swan and the Mason&#x27;s Arms. In recent years, a number of the village&#x27;s pubs have become restaurants; two of which now serve Indian cuisine. The village has three social hubs: St Michael&#x27;s Rooms, Fromeside Community Centre and Greenfield, which host clubs, functions and other public events. Salem, the local Methodist church, is in Watley&#x27;s End.
Winterbourne contains branches of the Co-op and Tesco Express, a chemist, optician, a handful of dental practices and a library. Other village amenities include a bakery, butcher and a Post Office serving the community. Horses and cattle are a common sight in the fields, including in the Cloisters area, which has views of the Frome Valley and the Huckford Viaduct.

==Governance==

An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches from &quot;Winterbourne&quot; in the north west to Hambrook in the southeast. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,994.

==Schools==

Winterbourne contains several schools. The main primary schools are Elm Park and St Michael&#x27;s, with most students going on to attend the nearby secondary school, Winterbourne Academy, originally named The Ridings High School when formally opened by Tony Benn in 1957. Silverhill School and Day Nursery is an independent preparatory school for children aged 6 months to 11 years. St Michael&#x27;s was founded in 1813 by the abolitionists and educational reformers, Hannah More and William Wilberforce. The original school was located upstairs in the George and Dragon pub. Larger rooms were then provided in Bourne House, where the school remained until a permanent building was erected on the High Street. St Michael&#x27;s present location on Linden Close was opened in 1970.
St Michael&#x27;s alumna, J. K. Rowling, is reputed to have based much of her character, Albus Dumbledore, on Alfred Dunn, who was headmaster during her studies.

==Notable residents==
*Tim Bowles, politician and first Mayor of the West of England.
*James Bracey, Gloucestershire and England cricketer.
*Edward Colston, merchant, slave trader and Member of Parliament, is believed to have spent much of his childhood in Winterbourne.
*Joe Fry, racing driver, was born in Winterbourne in 1915.
*Harry Grindell Matthews, inventor, was born in Winterbourne in 1880. His childhood home was located at what is now The Grove Residential Home for the Elderly on the High Street where there is a blue plaque commemorating this link.
*Dan Norris, MP and second Mayor of the West of England.
*J. K. Rowling, author of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, lived in Winterbourne until she was nine years old. Potter&#x27;s surname originated from some of her friends in the village.

==Sport and leisure==

Winterbourne has a Non-League football club Winterbourne United F.C. who play at Parkside Avenue and a popular village cricket club that fields 5 senior sides - Winterbourne CC - who share the same ground. Winterbourne Down Border Morris performs during the year at events such as wassailing, and especially on Boxing Day when they perform a Mummers play.

<text>A child harness (alternative: &quot;child tether&quot;, &quot;walking harness&quot;, British English: &quot;walking reins&quot;) is a safety device sometimes worn by children when walking with a parent or carer. Child harnesses are most commonly used with toddlers and children of preschool age, though they may also be used with older children, especially if they have special supervisory needs such as ADHD or autism. Various types exist, though all are worn by the child and have a lead (tether) or rein which is held by a parent or caregiver. As child harness designs and purposes have evolved with cultural norms and parenting techniques, they have become subject to common debate.

== Use and purpose ==

Child harnesses are designed to provide safety for a child when walking by preventing them from being separated from their parent or caregiver. Additionally, some may be used to help keep a child safely seated in a stroller or high chair. Typically used for children between one and four years of age, the use of child harnesses depends on a variety of factors including the age and maturity of the child, as well as any perceived dangers such as busy roads, large crowds, and potential distractions. Other factors such as neurological and health conditions may also be considered, particularly for older children with unique supervisory requirements.

== History ==

===Pre-1900===

While there is little documentation on child harnesses before the twentieth century, they may have emerged from leading strings used during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the late nineteenth century, evidence suggests they were mostly considered as items of clothing, primarily worn by young children learning to walk. The &quot;Baby-Exercising Corset&quot; patented in New Jersey in 1874 aimed to &quot;enable them to learn to walk much sooner, and much more readily, than they could with out its use.&quot;

===Early 20th century===

After 1900, designs evolved from a type of garment into dedicated safety harnesses most commonly &quot;in the form of a waist belt, shoulder straps connecting the waist belt...and a suspending strap for a person to sustain the weight of the child.&quot; While earlier patent applications for child harnesses mention protection from potential dangers, designs beginning in the twentieth century were &quot;particularly directed to the prevention of injury.&quot;, With the transition towards safety as the main priority, designs changed &quot;to provide a readily applicable harness for retaining a child in standing position in a chair, go-cart, or the like, and thereby obviating the danger of the child falling.&quot;. Harnesses at this time were usually made of leather, and some designs also had small bells attached.

===1940s–1980s===

By the 1940s in the United Kingdom, child harnesses were fairly common. Designs in the United Kingdom and the United States began to change in the 1950s with the straps being made of webbing instead of leather, and purposely designed fittings to make the harnesses easier to use for parents and caregivers.

In the mid-1950s, various local campaign groups in the United Kingdom began to recommend the use of child harnesses as part of road safety campaigns. In addition to recommendations, the campaigns also focused on abolishing the thirty percent sales tax payable on child harnesses, arguing removing the tax would be &quot;a sign that the Government was sincerely interested in the safety of young children.&quot; The debate around possible legislation for child harnesses continued into the 1960s, with the British Standards Institute issuing new safety standards. The &quot;stringent specifications&quot; sought to address the &quot;harnesses on the market which were not sufficiently strong to restrain a bouncing baby in a pram, or to take the weight of a falling toddler,&quot; with all designs after November 1964 being subject to &quot;rigorous performance tests&quot; for both design and materials.

Designs advanced further in the 1960s with Roland Cheetham (W.H. Cheetham &amp; Sons Limited) inventing the first terylene webbing harness in 1961. Going on sale in 1962, the new webbing material had &quot;a high resistance...to abrasion and moisture&quot; with the company claiming the design was &quot;virtually ever-lasting.&quot; The new materials were lighter than previous versions, and the company also claimed the material was more hygienic as the harness could be washed and dried in five minutes. The new design and was awarded the certificate of the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene. The design also featured improved fittings &quot;so that the mother does not have to bother with buckles&quot; and could &quot;vary the size easily.&quot; The harness was sold in four different colors with a suggested retail price of twelve shillings and sixpence.

Child harness designs remained largely unchanged between the 1970s and 1990s, the most significant change being the replacement of metal parts with plastic parts. The most notable exception, patented in 1987, was the &quot;wrist link&quot; or &quot;wrist strap&quot; which dispensed with the chest harness section, instead consisting of a length of webbing with a loop at each end. One loop secures around the wrist of the child, while the other is held by the parent or caregiver. The idea was to address how parents and/or caregivers could find it &quot;very impractical to use one hand to hold the child at all times&quot; and thus &quot;leaves the parent&#x27;s hands free.&quot; The wrist link/strap design was also noted to be &quot;adaptable to children of any size or age&quot;. Other hands-free adaptions to the established designs of child harnesses were also developed in the late 1980s.

===Post-1990===

In the United Kingdom, following the 1993 James Bulger murder case, sales of child harnesses &quot;dramatically increased&quot; and some stores sold out when &quot;trying desperately to meet demand.&quot; Two years later, child harnesses were recommended by the Child Accident Prevention Trust as part of their &quot;Seven Steps for Safety Campaign.&quot;

In 2005, after a largely standardized design for forty years, an alternative design for child harnesses was created which merged the basic strap elements with a soft toy. The new design, developed by Goldbug, Inc. in the United States, evolved into &quot;a backpack...in the form of a novelty character of animal or human form&quot; which also included a &quot;storage pouch&quot; with &quot;the shoulder and waist straps of the harness representing the limbs or extremities of the character, and a tether attached to the harness in the form of a character tail.&quot; The alternative designs, which included a variety of popular soft toys such as monkeys, giraffes, and teddy bears, were developed and marketed as &quot;Harness Buddies&quot; to discourage any objections of a child to wearing a safety harness through providing more comfort, padding, and overall novelty.

In 2007, Scottish primary school teacher Elaine Stephen, MBE launched the Walkodile harness. The design, developed in partnership with &quot;The Design Unit&quot; at De Montfort University, was the first child harness which could be used for multiple children, allowing for two or more children to walk together side-by-side. Each child has their own simplified safety belt which can be attached to any connection point located on an extendable modular section which is located between the parallel rows of children.

In May 2014, British retailer Boots was criticized for its range of child harnesses as some felt the colors and designs reinforced traditional gender roles. The company sold two harnesses; a blue version with the words &quot;Train Driver&quot; and another pink version which featured the words &quot;Little Cupcake&quot; specifically labelled as a &quot;Girls Walking Rein and Harness&quot;. After a consumer photo of the harnesses went viral, the retailer responded by promising to change the packaging to demonstrate their &quot;commitment to prevent gender stereotyping.&quot;

== Types ==

===Standard harness===
The standard design usually consists of a waist or chest strap and two shoulder straps forming a simple chest harness, most commonly with the closure behind the child. A walking lead, tether, or rein attaches at the back or sides of the chest harness and is held by the parent or caregiver behind the child. This design is sometimes used to safely secure a child in a stroller or high chair as well as for walking. The most historically established design, standard style child harnesses are made of either leather or webbing and are primarily sold for children between four years of age or younger.

===Character harness===

Character harnesses integrate the functions of the standard child harness and a soft toy. Some designs are based around simple generic soft toy characters such as monkeys, teddy bears, or bunnies; while others are based around well-known children&#x27;s entertainment characters. Character harnesses share the same basic features as standard child harnesses, but often have a front closure and are designed to be more appealing for the child, parent, and/or caregiver via additional comfort and novelty. Some also feature small storage pockets.
===Backpack harness===

Backpack harnesses integrate the functions of a standard child harness and a backpack. Designs are generally based around a basic backpack, suitably sized for a child with a connection for a lead or tether. Like character harnesses, backpack harnesses usually feature closures at the front of the harness and are marketed as an alternative to standard child harnesses for a similar age group.

===Wrist link===

A wrist link (sometimes called a wrist strap or wrist rein), is a simple length of webbing with two loops; one at each end. One loop is worn on the child&#x27;s wrist and the other is held by the parent or caregiver. Usually, the loops are adjustable for size and the strap often features an elastic section to prevent injury by absorbing shock from any sudden movements. Some wrist links use a strong coiled line instead of webbing or elastic. Wrist links are sometimes marketed as suitable for those in the &quot;junior&quot; age range and are occasionally worn by children who may have outgrown the standard or backpack style child harnesses.
===Special needs harness===

For older children and adolescents who have special supervision requirements due to health or behavioral conditions, larger, and sometimes bespoke, versions of child harnesses are available. These designs vary, but often include features atypical of standard child harnesses designed for younger kids such as support handles, lockable closures, and additional straps to prevent removal.

===Sports/recreational harness===

While not designed for everyday use, some specialist child harnesses exist for specific recreational purposes such as hiking or skiing. These types of harnesses feature unique elements such as longer leads to assist children in sports training techniques.

==Common debate==
There is some disagreement about the use of child harnesses which focuses on a number of aspects including safety, physical health, mental development/behavior, as well as parenting philosophies and styles. Opinion is divided among parents (and non-parents) but also among childcare and educational professionals.

===Safety===

Those who use or suggest using child harnesses say that they provide more safety for the child, especially for more active children. Parents and caregivers who advocate using child harnesses cite the impulsivity of toddlers or young children to unknowingly put themselves in danger as a main reason for their use. Some childcare professionals cite the preventative principle of child harnesses to help avert situations where the child might place themselves at risk. A 1991 report in the Archives of Disease in Childhood journal stated that six childhood fatalities which occurred within the Greater London and Birmingham areas of the United Kingdom could have been prevented by the use of child harnesses (reins). For those involved in childcare who believe that &quot;care and safety is their number one priority,&quot; harnesses can be &quot;the best option&quot; in some circumstances.

Others contend that the safety benefits of child harnesses are minimal, or at least unknown according to studies. In 2019, Benjamin Hoffman, the Chair of the Injury Prevention Council at the American Academy of Pediatrics stated that there was no &quot;data on injuries associated with [safety] leashes&quot; and that there was a &quot;lack information about why parents use them, and what any benefit might be,&quot; adding that &quot;from an injury standpoint&quot; there are potential concerns over entanglement or choking similar to the cords on window blinds and that &quot;there&#x27;s also the risk of accidentally tripping your child with the tether.&quot; Other medical professionals have also stated that certain designs of child harnesses such as the wrist link/strap maybe potentially dangerous for children as they do not provide adequate physical support when needed and also require a degree of cooperation from the child which may be intermittent.

===Physical health===

Those who use, or agree with the use of child harnesses, often contend that they improve the physical health of child by allowing them to walk and thereby provide opportunities for exercise. These arguments are especially prevalent when the use of child harnesses is compared to the time a child might otherwise spend in a stroller and thus not able to walk (or jog or run). A 2001 textbook aimed at students studying for the Child Development GCSE states that &quot;walking reins with a safety harness are essential for toddlers, as they can experience walking skills while remaining under the control of an adult.&quot; The 2019 OCR handbook for the Cambridge National qualification in Child Development lists child harnesses as a &quot;key factor&quot; in considering the right equipment to &quot;promote the well-being and development&quot; of children aged between one and five years.

Those who oppose child harnesses on grounds of physical health often cite the risk of injury and/or misuse of harnesses. Such concerns include how some parents or caregivers might &quot;tug on the tether or drag the child.&quot;. Additionally, some individuals who oppose the use of child harnesses often contend they function as a &quot;leash&quot; to restrict movement and therefore offer negligible, little, or even reduced physical health benefits compared to children who are able to explore beyond the limits of movement which harnesses create. Furthermore, some opponents contend child harnesses operate as a substitute for rule making which can result in parents generating (albeit knowingly or unknowingly) &quot;more freedom to be less present&quot; and reduce their awareness of their child&#x27;s behavior in &quot;potentially dangerous places&quot;.

===Mental development/behavior===

Advocates and users of child harnesses argue that harnesses allow a safe range of exploration for the child, as well as being a useful &quot;communication tool and teaching method to help children learn to stay beside their parent or caregiver&quot; and thus assist them in understanding boundaries, recognizing potential dangers, and when exploration maybe unsafe or improper. Proponents claim that when used in the appropriate &quot;manner as a teaching tool&quot; harnesses will &quot;not have a negative effect&quot; on the child. Additionally, some supporters of child harness use have cited their own memories of how wearing a harness could be a form of enjoyment or play. In certain circumstances, child harnesses are also recommended by professionals specializing in the health of special needs children whose supervisory requirements may be different from those of neurotypical children.

Many who oppose child harnesses view them as a tool which delays or restricts learning and mental development about rules and potential dangers. Some contend child harnesses are substitute &quot;babysitters,&quot; a way for parents or caregivers to &quot;check out,&quot; and equate to a &quot;short-term, Band-Aid&quot; solution which results in parents not teaching children important safety and cultural rules. Some psychologists have argued that child harnesses limit the natural curiosity of young children and prohibit them from acquiring skills in self-control which subsequently reduces their ability to understand and respect rules as they grow older. Additionally, other psychologists contend child harnesses could be a source of embarrassment for the child.

===Parenting/caregiver philosophy/style===

The advocacy or disapproval of child harnesses is also determined by parenting styles and beliefs.

Parents and caregivers who use child harnesses often cite safety as the primary reason for doing so, fearing losing contact with the child. However, for some the use of child harnesses is only a temporary and/or reserve measure during the education and generation of trust in a child. Once the child has proved they have learned such knowledge &quot;the use of the tether can be faded&quot; showing that &quot;when used short term and in a loving manner as a teaching tool&quot; a harness &quot;should not have a negative effect on the child.&quot; Some parents and caregivers also claim that the use of harnesses can be more comfortable for the child as having to raise their arm to hold their parent&#x27;s hand for extended periods can be uncomfortable. Similarly, some parents argue that compared to having their child in a stroller, using a harness allows for more awareness of their child&#x27;s needs or wants. Equally, some parents have also observed that their children are more positive and happier during outdoor activity when wearing a harness compared to being a stroller, and that using a child harness &quot;has more to do with how it reflects on us as parents than how it actually affects our children.&quot; Additionally, some argue if a &quot;parent experiences a lot of anxiety&quot; to such an extent that &quot;it interferes with them taking their children outdoors or on other events&quot; if &quot;the tether increases the parents&#x27; feelings of competence and allows the child to go places ... than tethering could be beneficial&quot; for both adult and child.

Those who disapprove of child harnesses argue that their use can be socially degrading for children &quot;like treating a child like a dog or an animal&quot; which results in others possibly perceiving &quot;a parent who can&#x27;t control her toddler.&quot; Such viewpoints claim that making and enforcing appropriate rules is the primary job of the parent and a child harness avoids such responsibilities. Other childcare specialists have also raised concerns over the effect on the confidence of parents and caregivers with the &quot;worst part of using these harnesses and wrist links are the stares that you get from other people who don&#x27;t understand that they are a safety precaution.&quot; Others have expressed similar concerns regarding how such &quot;reactions could negatively impact a child&quot; as well as the parent or caregiver as &quot;the stigma from being stared at ... could play a larger role in traumatizing the child than the correct use of a tether.&quot; Some have also drawn philosophical parallels between using child harnesses for toddlers and the use of GPS and smartphone tracking apps for older children. These arguments contend that children benefit when having to solve problems alone or by seeking appropriate help, neither of which are possible if the child has a permanent form attachment to their parent or caregiver.

==Governmental and regulatory positions==

===European Union and United Kingdom===
Regulations can be traced back to old British Standards for mass-manufactured child harnesses. These British regulations were further developed within the European Union, where the harnesses must comply with the safety requirements as defined in the EN13210:2004 &quot;Children&#x27;s harnesses, reins and similar type articles&quot; standard. These rules cover a range of attributes such as strength, durability, use of small parts, shapes of components, substances or chemicals used for manufacturing, safety markings, and instructional information on safe use. They also define testing procedures. This European Standard still has the status of a British Standard (BS EN 13210:2004) in the UK.

A new version of the standard is under preparation in the EU; it will split into Part 1 (Children’s harnesses, reins –
Safety requirements and test methods) and Part 2 (Children’s harnesses incorporating backpacks and reins – Safety requirements and test methods).

In 2013, the European Child Safety Alliance (Eurosafe) recommended that a child harness approved to the EN13210:2004 safety standard will provide additional safety for children when using a second-hand stroller not yet equipped with a five-point harness.

As of 2019, rule four of the Highway Code of the United Kingdom, recommends that parents or caregivers use child harnesses (reins) for very young pedestrian children when walking alongside or crossing roads as a possible alternative to a pushchair (stroller) to ensure safety.

The use of such child harnesses is sometimes recommended by local authorities in certain areas where risk and potential dangers to children are considered much higher than usual. These include areas such as mountain paths which are steep or unpredictable underfoot thereby posing an increase of slipping or falling to young children or children inexperienced walking on such terrain.

===Other regions===
In the United States, the standards, safety, and potential recall process for child harnesses is overseen by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. In Australia, parallel standards of safety are developed and enforced through the Australian Product Safety System, overseen by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission.

<text>Boveney is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Dorney, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is situated near Windsor, between the villages of Eton Wick in Berkshire, and Dorney and Dorney Reach in Buckinghamshire. Since boundary changes in 1974 and 1995, Boveney is the southernmost village in Buckinghamshire. In 1931 the parish had a population of 630.
==Origin of name==

The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means &quot;above island&quot;. This refers to the island in the River Thames next to the village. The Anglo-Saxon name for the village was &quot;Bufanege&quot;.
==History==

Boveney was once a hamlet within the parish of Burnham, though it has long since been considered a separate village, particularly since the urban growth of nearby Slough. It became a separate civil parish in 1866, having been a chapelry before, and was part of Eton Rural District from 1894 to 1934. On 1 April 1934 the parish of Boveney was abolished, under a County Review Order, with the more urbanised part being added to Elton in Eton Urban District, and a larger, less populous part being added to the parish of Dorney.

The Church of St Mary Magdalene is in a remote part of the village by the River Thames. In 1983 the church was declared redundant and vested in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches, who repair and conserve it for visitors and local people to enjoy. In 2004 a major campaign was undertaken to repair the 14th century timber-framed tower and a further programme of repairs was planned for 2007, so the church was closed to visitors.

Dorney Common, which borders the village, is one of several locations to view Windsor Castle from outside the town of Windsor itself; the large open space affords panoramic views of the castle as well as parts of Eton.

==In literature==
The village is twice briefly mentioned in Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s book &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; (1889).

==Filming location==
Many TV and film companies use the village as a location.

The Church of St Mary Magdalene was used as a location for many Hammer Horror movies which were made at nearby Bray Studios. The &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;Silent World of Nicholas Quinn&quot; and the Kevin Costner movie &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; were partly filmed here. The signpost for the village appeared very briefly in the 1976 Sweeney episode &quot;I Want the Man&quot; as a white Mercedes Benz limousine turns left towards the village (06m 48secs standard Freemantle DVD).

<text>William Howard Gass (July 30, 1924 – December 6, 2017) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, critic, and philosophy professor. He wrote three novels, three collections of short stories, a collection of novellas, and seven volumes of essays, three of which won National Book Critics Circle Award prizes and one of which, &quot;A Temple of Texts&quot; (2006), won the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism. His 1995 novel &quot;The Tunnel&quot; received the American Book Award. His 2013 novel &quot;Middle C&quot; won the 2015 William Dean Howells Medal.

==Early life and education==
William Howard Gass was born on July 30, 1924, in Fargo, North Dakota. Soon after his birth, his family moved to Warren, Ohio, a steel town, where he attended local schools. He described his childhood as an unhappy one, with an abusive, racist father and a passive, alcoholic mother; critics would later cite his characters as having these same qualities. His father had been trained as an architect but, while serving during the First World War, had sustained back injuries that forced him to take a job as a high school drafting and architectural drawing teacher. His mother was a housewife.

As a boy, Gass read anything he could get his hands on. From &quot;The Shadow&quot; to &quot;The History of the French Revolution&quot;, Gass read constantly, although there were no bookstores in the town of Warren. Later he would claim that the advent of &quot;pocketbooks&quot; saved his literary life. He&#x27;d save up all the money he earned or obtained and, every two weeks, head down and buy as many pocketbooks as he could afford. Even though Gass was always a reader, his father disapproved of his aspirations and often berated him for it.

He attended Ohio Wesleyan University after graduating from Warren G. Harding High School, where he did very well, except for some difficulties in mathematics, then served as an ensign in the Navy during World War II for three and a half years, a period he described as perhaps the worst of his life. He earned his A.B. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in philosophy from Kenyon College (1947), where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. From there he entered Cornell University as a Susan Linn Fellow in Philosophy and, by 1954, had earned his PhD in that subject. While at Cornell, he studied under Max Black and, briefly, Ludwig Wittgenstein. His dissertation, &quot;A Philosophical Investigation of Metaphor&quot;, was based on his training as a philosopher of language. In graduate school, Gass read the work of Gertrude Stein, who influenced his writing. He named the twelve most influential books of his life: Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;, Virginia Woolf&#x27;s Diaries, Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot;, James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;A Country Doctor and Other Stories&quot;, Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot;, Colette&#x27;s &quot;Break of Day&quot;, W. B. Yeats&#x27;s &quot;The Tower&quot;, William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, Stein&#x27;s &quot;Three Lives&quot; and William Gaddis&#x27;s &quot;The Recognitions&quot;.

== Teaching ==
Gass taught at The College of Wooster for four years, Purdue University for sixteen years, and Washington University in St. Louis, where he was a professor of philosophy (1969–1978) and the David May Distinguished University Professor in the Humanities (1979–1999). His colleagues there included the writers Stanley Elkin, Howard Nemerov (1988 Poet Laureate of the United States), and Mona Van Duyn (1992 Poet Laureate). After 2000, Gass was the David May Distinguished University Professor Emeritus in the Humanities.

== Personal life ==
In 1952, before graduating from Cornell, he married Mary Pat O&#x27;Kelly. The marriage ended in divorce. He had two sons and a daughter with his first wife: Richard, Robert and Susan.

Gass later married architect Mary Henderson Gass, author of &quot;Parkview: A St. Louis Urban Oasis&quot; (2005). They had twin daughters, Catherine and Elizabeth Gass-Boshoven. Catherine is an artist teaching at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and is a photographer for the Newberry Library.

==Writing and publications==
Earning a living for himself and his family from university teaching, Gass began to publish stories that were selected for inclusion in &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; of 1959, 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1980, as well as &quot;Two Hundred Years of Great American Short Stories&quot;. His debut novel, &quot;Omensetter&#x27;s Luck&quot;, about life in a small town in Ohio in the 1890s, was published in 1966. Critics praised his linguistic virtuosity, establishing him as an important writer of fiction. Richard Gilman in &quot;The New Republic&quot; called it &quot;the most important work of fiction by an American in this literary generation.&quot; In 1968 he published &quot;In the Heart of the Heart of the Country&quot;, five stories dramatizing the theme of human isolation and the difficulty of love. That same year Gass published &quot;Willie Masters&#x27; Lonesome Wife&quot;, an experimental novella illustrated with photographs and typographical constructs intended to help readers free themselves from the linear conventions of narrative. He also published several collections of essays, including &quot;Fiction and the Figures of Life&quot; (1970) and &quot;Finding a Form&quot; (1996). &quot;Cartesian Sonata and Other Novellas&quot; was published in 1998, and his novel &quot;Middle C&quot; was published in 2013. His work also appeared in &quot;The Best American Essays&quot; collections of 1986, 1992, and 2000.

Gass cited the anger he felt during his childhood as a major influence on his work, even stating that he wrote &quot;to get even.&quot; Despite his prolific output, he said that writing was difficult for him. In fact, his epic novel &quot;The Tunnel&quot;, published in 1995, took Gass 26 years to write. On the subject of his slow and methodic pace he said, &quot;I write slowly because I write badly. I have to rewrite everything many, many times just to achieve mediocrity.&quot; Critical responses to &quot;The Tunnel&quot; upon its release included Robert Kelly&#x27;s declaration that it was an &quot;infuriating and offensive masterpiece,&quot; and Steven Moore&#x27;s claim that it was ”a stupendous achievement and obviously one of the greatest novels of the century.” Michael Silverblatt of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in his review of the novel: &quot;A bleak, black book, it engenders awe and despair. I have read it in its entirety 4½ times, each time finding its resonance and beauty so great as to demand another reading. As I read, I found myself devastated by the thoroughness of the book&#x27;s annihilating sensibility and revived by the beauty of its language, the complexity of its design, the melancholy, horror and stoic sympathy in its rendering of what we used to call the human condition.&quot; Gass, in reference to the harsh and disquieting nature of &quot;The Tunnel&quot; said &quot;I don&#x27;t think anything is sacred and therefore I am prepared to extol or make fun of anything. People who have very settled opinions are going to dislike this book because Kohler [the main character] is the worm inside all that stuff.&quot; An unabridged audio version of &quot;The Tunnel&quot; was released in 2006, with Gass reading the novel himself.

Gass typically devoted enormous attention to sentence construction. His prose has been described as flashy, difficult, edgy, masterful, inventive, and musical. Steven Moore, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, called Gass &quot;the finest prose stylist in America.&quot; Much of Gass&#x27;s work is metafictional. In an interview with &quot;Anglistik&quot; Gass commented on the subject of his genre and form defying works, laughing off the title &quot;Postmodern,&quot; and coining himself &quot;&quot;Late&quot; or &quot;Decayed Modern&quot;&quot;

==Gass&#x27;s opinion of metaphor==
Though much of Gass&#x27;s central aesthetic has remained constant, there have been gradual shifts in his views of metaphor and ontology of the text. His view of metaphor is far more expansive than that proposed in his dissertation [&quot;A Philosophical Investigation of Metaphor&quot;]. Gass tells LeClair that &quot;[m]etaphor has been thought to be a pet of language, a peculiar relation between subject and predicate ... [b]ut you can make metaphors by juxtaposing objects and in lots of other ways&quot; (&quot;The Paris Review&quot;). In other words, metaphor need not be a purely linguistic matter, and perhaps not surprisingly Gass&#x27;s change in his explanation of metaphor from graduate school to now signals a change in the focus of his fiction. As noted earlier Gass claims to construct self-contained systems of ideas, but in these interviews, one can trace a growing concern with the relationship of his fiction to the world, as he makes clear to LeClair: &quot;I&#x27;ve been principally interested in establishing the relationship between fiction and the world. If we can see that relationship as a metaphorical one, then we are already several steps in the direction of our models.&quot;
==Major works==

===&quot;Omensetter&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1966)===

In this debut novel, William Gass details characters in a small town in rural Ohio during the 1890s and their reaction to the presence of a man named Brackett Omensetter whose confrontations with the crazed Reverend Jethro Furber galvanize the community. &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; described it as &quot;A rich fever, a parade of secrets, delirious, tormented, terrifying, comic...one of the most exciting, energetic and beautiful novels we can ever hope to read.&quot;

===&quot;The Tunnel&quot; (1995)===

&quot;The Tunnel&quot; is a novel about a man named William Frederick Kohler and his attempt to write an introduction to his historical &quot;magnum opus,&quot; &quot;&quot;Guilt and Innocence in Hitler&#x27;s Germany&quot;.&quot; But when Kohler tries to flesh out this minor introduction, mostly for the purposes of gloating over his colleagues, he instead finds himself writing a deeply personal book about the history of his own life. As the novel progresses we see the lies, half-truths, violent emotions, and relative chaos of Kohler&#x27;s life laid bare, and while he continues to dig away at the memories of his past he also begins digging a tunnel out from the basement where he works, a reflection of his tunneling through himself. The novel addresses ideas about history, evil, and the living and the dead.

===&quot;Middle C&quot; (2013)===

&quot;Middle C&quot; is the story of Joseph Skizzen, a middling professor leading a middling life in the middle of Ohio. His father got the family out of Austria before the War by pretending they were Jewish. In London during the war, the father disappeared, presumed to have escaped to Canada or the United States, and the rest of the family makes it to Ohio. As an adult, Skizzen lives with his mother and has a rich fantasy life, centered on his Inhumanity Museum and Arnold Schoenberg.

==Awards and honors==
Gass received many awards and honors, including grants from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1965, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1970. He won the Pushcart Prize awards in 1976, 1983, 1987, and 1992, and in 1994 he received the Mark Twain Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Literature of the Midwest. In 1959 he was awarded the Longview Foundation Prize for Fiction for his story &quot;The Triumph of Israbestis Tott&quot; (a story later included as the first part of his novel &quot;Omensetter&#x27;s Luck&quot;). Chicago Tribune Writers&#x27; and Critics&#x27; Poll named him one of the ten best American writers and one of the ten best Midwest writers in 1973. He has teaching awards from Purdue University and Washington University; in 1968 the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Award as One of the Ten Best Teachers in the Big Ten. In 1975 he received the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Fiction. He was a Getty Foundation Fellow in 1991–1992. He received the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997; and the American Book Award for &quot;The Tunnel&quot; in 1996. In 2000 he was honored with the PEN/Nabokov Award and the PEN/Nabokov Lifetime Achievement award which he has called his &quot;most prized prize.&quot; Gass has received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism three times, for &quot;Habitations of the Word&quot; (1985), &quot;Finding a Form&quot; (1997) and &quot;Tests of Time&quot; (2003). Gass also received the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay for &quot;Test of Time&quot; in 2003. In 2007 he was the recipient of the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates

Gass founded the International Writers Center at Washington University in 1990, whose purpose was to &quot;build on the strengths of its resident and visiting faculty writers; to serve as a focal point for writing excellence in all disciplines and in all cultures; to be a directory for writers and writing programs at Washington University, in St. Louis, in the United States, and around the world; and to present the writer to the reader.&quot; He made numerous presentations of his photography, and he has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. He also served on the contributing editorial board of the literary journal &quot;Conjunctions&quot;. In 2006, William H. Gass was a featured speaker at Lake Forest College for the 2006 &amp;NOW Festival and the Lake Forest Literary Festival.

In Dan Simmons&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Hyperion&quot;, Gass is referred to as &quot;the twentieth century&#x27;s most honoured writer&quot; by the poet Martin Silenus.

More recently, Gass won the 2007 Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in Memory of Newton Arvin. The winner of this award is chosen by a panel of six authors, and s/he also receives a cash prize of $30,000. The panel awarded Gass for his 2006 collection of essays, &quot;A Temple of Texts&quot;.

<text>Rankin Inlet, which fronts to Hudson Bay, is an Inuit hamlet on the Kudlulik Peninsula in Nunavut, Canada. It is the largest hamlet and second-largest settlement in Nunavut after the territorial capital, Iqaluit. Rankin Inlet is the regional centre for the Kivalliq Region.

In the 1995 Nunavut capital plebiscite, voters chose Iqaluit over Rankin Inlet to become the territorial capital of Nunavut.

==Inuktitut==
Rankin Inlet is also known in Inuktitut as ; Inuktitut syllabics: ᑲᖏᕿᓂᖅ or &quot;Kangirliniq&quot;, ᑲᖏᖅᖠᓂᖅ, or &quot;Kangir&amp;iniq&quot; meaning &quot;deep bay/inlet&quot;.

== History ==

Archaeological sites suggest the area was inhabited around 1200 CE by Thule people who were bowhead whale hunters. By the late 18th century, they were succeeded by Kivallirmiut (Caribou Inuit) who hunted the inland barren-ground caribou, and fished for Arctic char along the coast, as well as the Diane River and Meliadine River. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) established itself throughout the bay in the 17th century, and after 1717, sloops from Churchill, Manitoba traded north to Rankin Inlet and beyond. There was an unfortunate expedition shipwrecked on Marble Island, east of Rankin Inlet: James Knight&#x27;s expedition died on the island around 1722. It was surveyed by William Moor in 1747. HBC contact was followed in the mid-19th century by American and European whalers, who were followed by fur traders trapping Arctic foxes for their skins in the early 20th century, followed by missionaries who brought a written language system.

The town itself was founded by the owners of the Rankin Inlet Mine, just north of Johnston Cove. Starting in 1957, the mine produced nickel and copper ores from an underground operation. The mine was the first case of Inuit miners in Canada. When the mine closed in 1962, Rankin Inlet had a population of approximately 500 Inuit, and 70-80% had been mine workers. Several unsuccessful attempts followed to develop alternate sources of income for the town. These included a pig ranch in 1969 and a chicken-raising venture in the 1970s. Both animal groups were fed a diet of local fish, which gave the meat an unpleasant flavour. It was also common for the animals to freeze to death or be eaten by polar bears.

The Meliadine Gold Mine operated by Agnico Eagle opened in 2019 and is expected to produce until at least 2032. It is the second mine opened in the low Arctic, after the Meadowbank Gold Mine, and is both an underground and open-pit mine.

From 1985 to 1997, Kivalliq Hall operated as a boarding school for Inuit pupils; it had been recognized as a residential school for the pre-1995 period when it was operated by the Federal government.

Voters chose Iqaluit over Rankin Inlet to become the new territorial capital of Nunavut in the 1995 Nunavut capital plebiscite.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Rankin Inlet had a population of 2,975 living in 826 of its 1,026 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 2,842. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Arts and culture ==
Rankin Inlet is not only notable for its artists and artisans; it is recognized as housing the only Inuit fine-arts ceramics production facility in the world. Community artists work in a variety of media including ceramics, prints, bronze castings, carvings, watercolour and drawing. The Matchbox Gallery, founded in 1987, showcases art work and provides educational resources.

The community is served by &quot;Kivalliq News&quot;, a weekly newspaper which publishes in both English and Inuktitut.

The annual spring festival Pakallak Tyme includes a fishing competition and snowmobile races.

== Transportation ==
Due to the remoteness of the community and the fact that there is no all-season road to access the community, the primary mode of year-round transportation into and out of the community is by airplane. Two passenger airlines fly into the hamlet: Calm Air and Canadian North.

Calm Air flies direct to Winnipeg, with round-trip service twice daily on weekdays. Rankin Inlet serves as a hub for transit further into the Kivalliq region. Destinations from Rankin Inlet include Arviat, Baker Lake, Chesterfield Inlet, Coral Harbour, Naujaat, and Whale Cove.

Canadian North also serves the community, with service to Edmonton, Yellowknife, Iqaluit, and Montreal, on a milk-run that flies very infrequently.

The community is also serviced by sealifts originating from Montreal.

== Broadband communications ==

The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSi Canada. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.

== Geography ==
Rankin Inlet is notable for the chilling wind, severe winter storms, and water resources. The Diana River empties from the north into the hamlet&#x27;s namesake inlet. The Kivalliq Region has several lakes, the largest being Nipissa Lake, and is flanked by two bays, Melvin Bay on the west and Prairie Bay on the east. Paniqtoq Peninsula, on the inlet&#x27;s far western shore, provides a barrier shelter for the smaller Kivalliq Region. Dozens of islands dot the inlet, including Thomson Island, the largest, and the Barrier Islands, the longest chain. These natural resources attract tourists who hunt, fish, and canoe. The Iqalugaarjuup Nunanga Territorial Park, northwest of Rankin Inlet, is notable for hiking, fishing, bird watching and Thule archaeological sites.

===Climate===
Rankin Inlet has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Ecld&quot;), just short of a tundra climate. It is above the tree line. Temperatures stay below freezing from late September to early June. Although the climate is subarctic, temperatures rise and fall too rapidly and do not stay above for long enough (30 days) for trees to grow. Under the alternate formula for determining the boundary between Arctic and subarctic climates posited by Otto Nordenskjöld, however, Rankin Inlet, along with Arviat and Baker Lake, qualify as Arctic based on the relationship between the temperatures of the coldest and warmest months; in the case of Rankin Inlet, with a coldest-month (January) mean of , said boundary for the warmest month would be using the Nordenskjöld formula and Rankin Inlet&#x27;s warmest month (July) averages only .

Beginning on 16 January 2008, Rankin Inlet endured the longest recorded blizzard in Canada. Wind speed was or above, with gusts to , and wind chill values were as low as . This blizzard lasted 7 days 5 hours.

<text>In Irish mythology, Ethniu (; , ) in modern spelling, is the daughter of the Fomorian leader Balor, and the mother of Lugh. She is also referred to as Ethliu ().

==Name==

Ethniu is a fine example of the difficulty of conducting research into Irish mythology. The oldest version of her name is probably Ethliu or Ethniu, giving rise to the modern Irish name Eithne. However thanks to changes in the Irish language, the lack of standardised spelling for many centuries, and attempts to anglicise the name, variations have arisen. Linguistic ignorance has further confused the issue: the genitive form of &quot;Ethniu&quot; is &quot;Ethnenn&quot; (modern &quot;Eithneann&quot;) and the genitive of &quot;Ethliu&quot; is &quot;Ethlenn/Ethlinn&quot; (modern &quot;Eithleann&quot;, &quot;Eithlinne&quot;), as in &quot;mac Ethlenn&quot; (&quot;Ethliu&#x27;s son&quot;). This genitive has often been taken for a nominative, or a mistaken nominative has been inferred.

Variations and anglicizations include: Ethnea, Eithliu, Ethlend, Ethnen, Ethlenn, Ethnenn, Ethne, Aithne, Enya, Lily, Aine, Ena, Etney, Eithnenn, Eithlenn, Eithna, Ethni, Edlend, and Edlenn.

In the &quot;Wooing of Étaín&quot;, we are told that Eithne&#x27;s other name is Boand and in the Banshenchas Ethniu&#x27;s &quot;true name&quot; is revealed to be Feada.

==Relationships==

Eithne is the daughter of Balor and mother of Lugh. In some traditions Eithne is the daughter of Delbáeth, the mother of the Dagda and Ogma, and the wife of Nuada Airgetlám. In a variant version of the birth of Aengus, she is the wife of Elcmar who is seduced by the Dagda: as such she may be a double, and is explicitly named as such, of Boann, who plays that role in the best-known version of the tale. 

Although in most texts she is a female figure, there are some in which Ethniu is a male name. In the ancient text &quot;Baile in Scáil&quot; (&quot;The Phantom&#x27;s Ecstatic Vision&quot;), Lugh is said to the son of &quot;Ethliu son of Tigernmas&quot;, or the son of &quot;Ethniu son of Smretha son of Tigernmas&quot;. James Bonwick identifies Tigernmas, the king who introduced the worship of Crom Cruach, with Balor. R. A. Stewart Macalister also suggests that Cethlenn is originally a variant of Ethlenn arising from the frequent identification of Lugh as Lugh Mac Ethlenn (thus &quot;Mac Ethlenn&quot; → &quot;Mac Cethlenn&quot;).

==Mythology==
Her union with Lugh&#x27;s father, Cian (Cían) of the Tuatha Dé Danann, is presented in early texts as a simple dynastic marriage, but later folklore preserves a more involved tale, similar to the birth of Perseus in Greek mythology. A folktale recorded John O&#x27;Donovan in 1835 tells how Balor, in an attempt to avoid a druid&#x27;s prophecy that he will be killed by his own grandson, imprisons Ethniu in a tower on Tory Island away from all contact with men. 

Mac Cinnfhaelaidh (Cían), whose magical cow was stolen by Balle, gains access to Ethniu&#x27;s tower, with the magical help of the &quot;leanan sídhe&quot; Biróg, and seduces her. Ethniu gives birth to triplets, but Balor gathers them up in a sheet and sends a messenger to drown them in a whirlpool. The messenger drowns two of the babies, but unwittingly drops one in the harbour, where he is rescued by Biróg. She takes the child back to his father, who gives him to his brother, Gavida the smith, in fosterage. The boy grows up to kill Balor. 

By comparison with texts like &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; and the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, the unnamed boy is evidently Lugh, and his father, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh, is a stand-in for Cian. The Banshenchas states that her real name was Feada: &quot;Feada was the real name of noble Ethne who was wife of strong stout Cain, and mother of Lug the impetuous superman, and daughter of swift smiting Balor son of Dod son of mighty Net a greater man than pleasant Hector. From him is famed the cairn at Ath Feindead because he fought a duel.&quot;

The &quot;Fosterage of the Houses of the Two Methers&quot; has St. Patrick saying of Eithne:
&lt;poem&gt;I shall leave these virtues
for the story of Eithne from the fair Maigue.
Success in children, success in foster-sister or brother,
to those it may find sleeping with fair women.

If you tell of the fosterage 
before going in a ship or vessel,
you will come safe and prosperous
without danger from waves and billows.

If you tell of the fosterage
(before going to a) judgment or a hunting,
your case will be (prosperous),
all will be submissive before you.

To tell the story of Eithne
when bringing home a stately wife,
good the step you have decided on,
it will be a success of spouse and children.

Tell the story of noble Ethne
before going into a new banqueting house,
(you will be) without bitter fight or folly,
without the drawing of valiant, pointed weapons.

Tell to a king of many followers
the story of Ethne to a musical instrument,
he gets no cause to repent it,
provided he listen without conversation.

If you tell this story 
to the captives of Ireland,
it will be the same as if were opened
their locks and their bonds.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Popular culture==
* Ethniu is the primary antagonist of &quot;Peace Talks&quot; and &quot;Battle Ground&quot; (2020) by Jim Butcher, where she spearheads a Fomor invasion of Chicago.
