<text>Ethiopian Airlines (), formerly Ethiopian Air Lines (EAL), is the flag carrier of Ethiopia, and is wholly owned by the country&#x27;s government. EAL was founded on 21 December 1945 and commenced operations on 8 April 1946, expanding to international flights in 1951. The firm became a share company in 1965 and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines.

The airline has been a member of the International Air Transport Association since 1959 and of the African Airlines Association (AFRAA) since 1968. Ethiopian is a Star Alliance member, having joined in December 2011. The company slogan is &#x27;The New Spirit of Africa.&#x27; Ethiopian&#x27;s hub and headquarters are at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, from where it serves a network of 155 passenger destinations—22 of them domestic—and 68 freighter destinations. The airline has secondary hubs in Togo and Malawi. Ethiopian Airlines is Africa&#x27;s largest airline in terms of passengers carried, destinations served, fleet size, and revenue. Ethiopian Airlines is also the world&#x27;s fourth-largest airline by the number of countries served.

==History==
===The 1940s: early years===
After the liberation of Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie I asked the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to help him establish an airline as part of his modernization effort. According to the BBC News it is possible that the Emperor intended the creation of a quality national airline to help dispel impressions of Ethiopian poverty. In 1945, the Ethiopian government began negotiations with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express (later merged into TWA). On 8 September 1945, TWA signed an agreement with the American historian and foreign affairs advisor to Ethiopia John H. Spencer to establish a commercial aviation company in Ethiopia.

The carrier, originally called Ethiopian Air Lines (EAL), was founded on 21 December 1945, with an initial investment of ETB 2,5 million, divided in 25,000 shares that the government entirely held. The company was financed by the Ethiopian government but managed by TWA. At the beginning, it relied upon American pilots, technicians, administrators and accountants; even its General Managers were from TWA. Minister of Works and Communications Fitawrari Tafasse Habte Mikael became EAL first president and chairman, whereas H. H. Holloway —who was American— was appointed by TWA as general manager. The board held the first meeting on 26 December 1945, with a key point of the agenda being the deposit of E£75,000 in a bank in Cairo for the acquisition of aircraft and spare parts. Shortly afterwards, the airline negotiated for landing rights with Aden, Egypt, French Somaliland, Saudi Arabia and Sudan, and five Douglas C-47s were bought; these aircraft were flown to Addis Ababa in February 1946.

The new airline&#x27;s maiden flight to Nairobi carried a shipment of East African currency equivalent to  million in February 1946, but the first revenue scheduled service was on 8 April 1946; it travelled the Addis Ababa–Asmara–Cairo route using one of five Douglas C-47 Skytrains acquired from the US Government. This route later operated on a weekly basis. The Skytrains were initially intended for military use, although Ethiopian operated them in a mixed passenger-cargo configuration. Soon afterwards, the carrier launched services to Aden and Djibouti, as well as a domestic flight to Jimma. The main five routes in the early years were Addis Ababa–Asmara, Addis Ababa–Djibouti–Aden, Addis Ababa–Khartoum, Addis Ababa–Cairo (routed via Jeddah or Khartoum) and Asmara–Khartoum.

Henry Bruce Obermiller replaced Holloway as a general manager in June 1946. In July of the same year, four more Skytrains joined the fleet. New scheduled services to Sheikh Othman and Nairobi were launched in July 1946 and June 1947, respectively. In 1947, Waldon Gene Golien became the general manager, and the company started operating charter flights to Jeddah during the Hajj season. That year in February, three more Douglas C-47s were acquired to operate new international routes. A service to Mukalla was inaugurated in June 1947. In September, Port Sudan was added to the route network (it was previously a technical stop en route to Cairo), Lydda was incorporated as a scheduled destination in October and charter flights to Bombay were launched in November. Services to Lydda and Mukalla were discontinued in February and , respectively. In September, the route to Bombay became scheduled, with EAL flying as far as Aden, and BOAC operating the Aden–Bombay sector. The route also included stops at Mesirah Island in Oman and Karachi. For a brief period until April 1948, Mesirah Island was used as a refuelling stop; since then, services to French Somaliland and Aden started on a twice-weekly basis. EAL was allowed to fly to Aden using Sheik &#x27;Othman Airport, located away from the city, whereas BOAC used the Khormaksar Airport facilities, just from the city. Aden was under British rule at the time as was Sudan, and the British Empire denied EAL landing rights at Khartoum, forcing the airline to move the refuelling stop on the Aden route to Port Sudan. The carrier recorded a £40,000 profit for 1949.

=== The 1950s: start of long-haul routes ===

Services to Bombay were withdrawn in . Also this year, a loan granted from the Ex-Im Bank enabled the carrier to incorporate Convair CV-240s, aimed at operating international routes. Two CV-240s, named &quot;Eagle of Ethiopia&quot; and &quot;Haile Selassie I&quot;, entered the fleet in December 1950; starting January 1951, these aircraft were subsequently deployed on the Addis Ababa–Cairo, Addis Ababa–Nairobi, and Addis Ababa–Jeddah–Dhahran–Karachi routes, with Dhahran and Sharjah being incorporated to the route network on 20 February. In April 1952, the airline was appointed general sales agent for TWA in Kenya, Tanganyka, Uganda and Zanzibar, and by May the same year the fleet consisted of two Convair-Liner 240s and nine Douglas DC-3s or their subtypes, operating a route network that was long. Services to India and Sharjah were discontinued in 1953. On 14 July, a new agreement with TWA that succeeded the original one was signed. Unlike other companies, the airline&#x27;s preamble stated that it was &quot;the ultimate aim that EAL shall eventually be operated entirely by Ethiopian personnel&quot;.

A new service to Athens via Khartoum and Wadi Halfa was launched on 3 April 1954. A third Convair CV-240 (&quot;The Spiritual Power&quot;) was purchased from Sabena in 1955 for . These aircraft were equipped with rocket-assisted take-off devices. This was a common practice for a small number of airlines in the World that EAL had abandoned by . Also in 1955, Ethiopian inaugurated a self-owned maintenance facility. That year, Vic Harrell succeeded Swede Golien as general manager of the company. The carrier required newer and larger aircraft, and three different aircraft types —two from the Lockheed Corporation, the Constellation and the Electra, and the Douglas DC-6— were considered for the fleet renewal programme. Two Douglas DC-6Bs were eventually ordered in 1956 for  million, including spares; an option for a third machine was also taken. Another loan obtained from the Ex-Im Bank, a  million one dating back to 1955, was partly used to finance the two purchased aircraft.

Benghazi was briefly served between 7 November 1956 and 15 January 1957. In 1957, a third DC-6B was purchased. Likewise, that year the airline had been asked to take a Lockheed L-749 that had been given as a gift to the Emperor, who declined it. Ethiopian paid  million for this airframe, and it was incorporated into the fleet on 4 June; the aircraft was destroyed by fire on 10 July in an accident in Sudan. Two Yemeni cities, Hodeida and Taiz were first served on 1 September 1957. On , flights to Wadi Halfa were terminated. The incorporation of three Douglas DC-6Bs took place between May and July, and EAL started a new link between Addis Ababa and Athens, via Cairo, using these recently delivered aircraft. On 21 Jun, the route was extended both to the north and to the south so that Frankfurt and Nairobi became linked by the same corridor, operated with DC-6Bs. By this time, the Convairs were redeployed to serve domestic and regional routes. Given that radio operators were no longer required as part of flight crews, they were assigned other tasks with the airline. Swissair handled the pilot training for the DC-6B aircraft at Zürich. The suspension of fifth freedom rights between Djibouti and Aden prompted the discontinuance of the route that linked them. EAL joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on 1 January 1959. During the year, two Boeing 720Bs were ordered and scheduled for delivery in December 1961, two more DC-6Bs entered the fleet, services to Nairobi were suspended once more and the airline list of domestic destinations saw the incorporation of Bulchi, Dodollo, Lalibela and Masawa.

===The 1960s and 1970s: the jet age===

Port Sudan was removed from the list of destinations on . The airline had its first fatal accident on 15 July when a DC-3 crashed en route from Bulchi to Jimma, killing the pilot. A Convair 240 was sold to Allied Stores of Israel on 18 July. On 12 August, an order with Boeing for two Boeing 720B aircraft was placed. EAL general manager had already brought the idea of acquiring two jet aircraft for long-haul operations up in February, suggesting the Boeing 720B. The Sud SE-210 Caravelle, the de Havilland D.H.106 Comet 4 and the Boeing 720B were all taken into account. Hot and high condition of some EAL operations made the Caravelle inappropriate, whereas the Comet was considered obsolete. The first east-west link made by an African airline started on 8 November, when the Addis Ababa–Accra–Lagos–Monrovia route was launched using DC-6B equipment.

The second fatal accident took place on 5 September 1961 when another DC-3 crashed shortly after takeoff from Sendafar; a flight attendant and four passengers lost their lives in the accident. The event urged the Civil Aviation Department to investigate the accidents. It was found that the lack of infrastructure at many airfields, marginal even for DC-3 operations, was a major contribution. Landing sites at Gore, Mizan Teferi and Tippi were included in the list of airfields that would require closure. On 13 January 1962, the crew and passengers lost their lives in another accident involving a DC-3 ET-T-1, EAL first aircraft of the type—this time the crash taking place at Tippi while the aircraft was taking off. The event prompted the government to decide to close the airfields at both Mizan Teferi and Tippi. In March 1962, more DC-3s were acquired and registered ET-ABE and ET-ABF. During the year, the &quot;ET-T-&quot; registration would change to simply &quot;ET-&quot;. Jack B. Asire became general manager in April 1962.
It was also decided to build a new airport to replace the Lideta Airfield, which was unable to accommodate the Boeing 720 jetliner the company intended to acquire. This was the birth of Bole International Airport, where the company set its headquarters.

In December 1962, the arrival of Boeing 720s ordered directly from Boeing marked the carrier entrance into the jet age. These two aircraft were registered ET-AAG and ET-AAH and were named the &quot;Blue Nile&quot; and &quot;White Nile&quot;, respectively. The first jet service took place on 15 January 1963 when one of these aircraft was deployed on the route to Nairobi. The following day, a new service to Madrid was flown using the new jet equipment, with Frankfurt joining the jet network soon afterwards. On 1 April, the Boeing 720 replaced the DC-6B on the Addis Ababa–Athens route; during that month, the West African corridor also benefited from jet operations. The airline entered into a pool agreement with Aden Airways and Sudan Airways on the Khartoum–Asmara–Aden service. A new flight to Conakry was launched on 8 May 1963. Kano, which had been served since 18 March 1962, was removed from the list of destinations that day. On 30 November 1963, the airline lost another DC-3 (ET-AAT) in a test flight at Addis Ababa; the crew of suffered minor injuries. Rome was served for the first time on 5 June 1964 on a weekly basis; the flight was routed via either Khartoum or Athens as part of a pool agreement with Alitalia.

Also in the early 1960s, the carrier provided some initial aviation support to the Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission in its operation to acquire topographic maps of Ethiopia. The firm changed from a corporation to a share company in 1965 and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines.

By 1966, the contractual relationship with TWA was adjusted to reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an Ethiopian deputy general manager, and Col. Semret Medhane was appointed to the post.
Two Boeing 720s were in operation and a Boeing 707-320C was due to be phased in by March 1968, when the carrier ordered a second -320C.

In 1970, the fifth renewal of the original 1945 contract changed TWA&#x27;s role from manager to adviser. On its 25th anniversary in 1971, the company was ready to continue without foreign assistance. Since then, Ethiopian Airlines has been managed and staffed by Ethiopian personnel. The first Ethiopian General Manager was Col. Semret Medhane, appointed in 1971. Two Boeing 720Bs were acquired from Continental Airlines in 1973. In 1975, the carrier ordered five Dash 7s. By then, Ethiopian Airlines had ended its 30-year relationship with TWA. The airline became a new customer for the Boeing 727 in 1978, ordering two. The 727s arrived in the late 1970s as a replacement for the oldest Boeing 720s.

===The 1980s and 1990s===

The DHC-5 Buffalo entered Ethiopian&#x27;s fleet in the early 1980s. In 1982, Ethiopian became the first African carrier in ordering the Boeing 767, as well as the first airline to order the Boeing 767-200ER. On 1 June 1984, the first of these aircraft set a new distance record for a twinjet, flying non-stop from Washington, D.C. to Addis Ababa, on delivery to the company. The came to replace the remaining Boeing 720s. ATR 42s and Twin Otters were incorporated into the fleet in the mid-1980s, with the first of six Twin Otters entering the fleet in early 1985. The Boeing 737-200 joined the fleet in late 1987.

In 1990 the carrier secured a $90 million credit through the AfDB to expand the main airport in the capital. Ethiopian became the first passenger airline in taking delivery of the Boeing 757 Freighter, receiving the first of five in 1991. By 1996 the airline was flying to Bangkok, Beijing, Durban and Johannesburg; routes to Ivory Coast and Senegal were also being operated. The Fokker 50 entered the fleet to operate domestic routes; Ethiopian became the last company to take delivery of this aircraft in 1997, just after the collapse of Fokker due to financial problems. In the late 1990s the carrier saw the incorporation of Copenhagen and Maputo to its international network, as well as New York City and Washington, D.C. as transatlantic destinations; the frequent-flyer program, named &quot;Sheba Miles&quot; after the legendary Queen of Sheba, was launched too. In 1998, the airline&#x27;s flights to the Eritrean capital Asmara were disrupted when a war erupted between the two countries.

===2000present===

A fleet renewal started in the early 2000s, with the incorporation of the Boeing 737-700 and the Boeing 767-300ER; The airline discontinued its service to Newark in favour of serving Washington, D.C. in 2004. In the late 2000s the airline announced it would be the launch customer of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and placed orders to acquire new Airbus A350-900s, Boeing 777-200LRs and Bombardier equipment.

In late September 2010, Ethiopian Airlines was invited to join Star Alliance under the mentoring of Lufthansa. The carrier became a member of the alliance in December 2011, the third Africa-based carrier to do so—following EgyptAir and South African Airways—and the 28th member worldwide.

In 2024, Ethiopia offered the unrecognised country Somaliland equity in the airline in exchange for the use of a Somaliland port. On 20 January 2025, Ethiopia announced that the airline will be launching flights between Addis Ababa and Hyderabad, offering three weekly flights on its Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft.

==Corporate affairs==

===Business trends===
Performance figures for the government-owned Ethiopian Airlines are available in their Annual Reports and occasional press reports. Available recent trends are (as of year ending 30 June):

===Management and ownership===
The airline, which is wholly owned by the Government of Ethiopia, has traditionally been unfettered by government intervention, even during times of significant turmoil and domestic hardship. Whereas many African state-owned airlines were and remain often poorly run, with staffings often serving nepotistic purposes, and business decisions being made on political grounds, Ethiopian Airlines remained professionally run and managed, leading &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; to term it in 1988 a &quot;capitalist success in Marxist Ethiopia&quot;.

The Derg, after expanding the airline&#x27;s workforce, which had resulted in a decline in service quality and revenues, allowed the airline to be run on a &quot;strictly commercial basis&quot;. The carrier had gone through a period of difficulties pending the nomination of Captain Mohammed Ahmed, who would be CEO throughout the entire 1980s, and slashed the workforce by 10%. The airline continued the acquisition of Western, rather than Soviet aircraft, despite the links between the communist government and the Soviet Union, purchasing the Boeing 727 in 1979 and the Boeing 767 in 1984. Despite famine, unfavorable exchange rates, and general economic disarray, the airline managed to retain its reputation, particularly in the provision of maintenance and training. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; noted that it managed to remain one of the most profitable airlines in Africa throughout the decade.

Despite the violent overthrow of the communist government by the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front in 1991, the airline managed to post a profit for the fiscal year. In 1994, 40 top executives including the general manager Capt. Zelleke Demissie were fired after they signed a letter rebuking a government report, and a new general manager from outside the industry, Dr. Ahmed Kellow, was appointed.
The airline would regain operational independence when longtime company veteran Bisrat Nigatu was appointed to the top post in 1997, and remained fiscally sound, despite disruptions caused by the Eritrean-Ethiopian War.

In 2018 it was announced that the Ethiopian government would partially or wholly privatize several state-owned enterprises, amongst them Ethiopian Airlines, although it would retain a majority stake in key firms, including the airline. The CEO at the time suggested other African states like Nigeria purchase a minority stake in the airline. In October 2020, the Ministry of Finance postponed the planned privatization of the state-owned airline.

The current CEO is Mesfin Tasew, who was appointed by the airline&#x27;s board of directors on 24 March 2022. Mesfin has been working at Ethiopian Airlines since 1984. He also was the CEO of Asky Airlines, a strategic partner of Ethiopian Airlines. Before that, Tewolde GebreMariam served as the airline&#x27;s Group CEO from 2011 until his resignation in March 2022.

===Organization===
The Ethiopian government reorganized the airline as a fully owned aviation holding group in July 2017. The aim was to maximize efficiency, enhance customer service to a global standard, and ease longterm planning. The initial group consisted of: The Ethiopian Airports Enterprise (EAE), the Passenger Airline company, Cargo Airline, and Logistics Company, Ethiopian Aviation Academy, Ethiopian In-flight Catering Services, Ethiopian MRO Services, and Ethiopian Hotel and Tourism Services. The MRO Services is the largest such operation serving the continent and the Med-Eastern region; fully accredited by FAA and EASA. The Cargo and Logistical division is expanding to increase annual capacity to 1.5 million tons. Ethiopian Aviation Academy (now upgraded to Aviation University) inaugurated a second campus for pilot training in Hawassa city in 2023.

===Head office===

Ethiopian Airlines currently has its head office at Bole International Airport, Addis Ababa, but intends to build a new head office facility. A contest for the design was held in 2009, but none of those plans were proceeded with. On 16 February 2011, it held a second round, and in September 2011 it was announced that BET Architect Plc won the contest. The airline stated that the estimated Br300 million complex will be constructed on a plot at Bole International Airport. The company that received 4th place in the competition&#x27;s second round has threatened to take legal action, accusing the airline of not giving due consideration to the proposed design.

===Strategic ambitions and landmarks===
The airline was featured by &quot;The Economist&quot; as an example of excellence in late 1987, and economist Paul B. Henze recognized it in 2000 as being &quot;one of the most reliable and profitable airlines in the Third World&quot;. In July 2011, Ethiopian was named Africa&#x27;s most profitable airline for the year 2010 by &quot;Air Transport World&quot;, and it has also been praised by AFRAA for its sustained profitability over recent years.

As a long-term company policy, in addition to the carrier&#x27;s main activities, revenues are also generated by providing aircraft maintenance to foreign airlines, and specialist training for both Ethiopian and foreign trainees. Every year, pilots and technicians graduate from both the Pilot School, inaugurated in 1964, and the Aviation Maintenance Technician School, established in 1967. The American Federal Aviation Administration accredited the airline&#x27;s maintenance division with licence No. ETIY 102F.

Ethiopian Airlines started Vision 2010 in 2005, which aimed to increase passenger traffic to 3 million, revenue to  billion and employees to 6,000 by 2010. By 2010, Ethiopian had exceeded all goals set in Vision 2010, and the company&#x27;s net profit for the fiscal year ended 2010-6-30 was  million. The results were attributed in part to an aggressive marketing campaign and major cost-cutting measures.

In 2010, Ethiopian adopted Vision 2025, a 15-year development strategy, under which the airline anticipated increasing its fleet to 120, the number of destinations to 90, carrying more than 18 million passengers and of cargo, with 17,000 employees. Vision 2025 also considered a fourfold expansion of the capacity building for trainees in the airline&#x27;s aviation academy. Ethiopian achieved its vision 2025 well ahead of time in 2018, with an average growth rate of 25% throughout the decade, a fleet size of 126, and 127 destinations during the 2019/2020 FY. Its net profit in the 2018/19 financial year rose to 260 million USD, while its operating revenue rose to 4 billion USD – figures unmatched by any other carrier on the continent. Tewolde GebreMariam, the then Group CEO, told The Africa Report &quot;Some of the targets we set in 2010 to be achieved by 2025, we achieved by 2016.&quot; In 2021/22 FY, the airline posted a revenue of 5 billion USD — a 79% growth compared to the previous year and achieved a 90% growth in profit, culminating in a total of 937 million USD &quot;despite the headwinds of worsening global economic outlook, rising fuel cost and global pandemic&quot;.

Having met its 15-year strategic plan Vision 2025 ahead of time, Ethiopian has charted out a more ambitious strategic roadmap called Vision 2035 to further bolster its continuous growth. With this new roadmap, Ethiopian plans to nearly double the fleet size from 145 to 271, and to increase from 133 to 207 international destinations. It aims to increase its passenger traffic from 14 million in 2022 to 65 million passengers in 2035. It has also planned to grow its cargo from 723,000 tons in 2022 to 3 million tons/year. The airline aims to generate 25 billion USD in revenue by the end of the roadmap as compared to 6.1 billion USD in 2022 FY. The overarching goal of Vision 2035 is to position Ethiopian Airlines among the top 20 aviation groups globally.

The airline announced in 2020, its plans to build a new 6 billion dollar mega-airport with the capacity to handle 100 million passengers a year. The new airport will be built in Bishoftu, 38 km south of Addis Ababa. Though existing Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa has undergone massive expansion in 2019, from just 7 million to a capacity of 22 million passengers per year, it is still significantly below the airline&#x27;s projected capacity demands. Therefore, the new airport is needed to take the pressure off the existing airport as passenger travel grows. Addis Ababa Bole International Airport has taken the crown from Dubai International Airport, in 2018, as the gateway to and from Africa travel.

Ethiopian ordered 67 Boeing aircraft Including 737 MAX &amp; 787 Dreamliners at the Dubai Air Show, in 2023 making it the largest-ever purchase of Boeing airplanes in African history. The order is consistent with the airlines&#x27; Vision 2035 roadmap. It has also committed to buy 11 additional Airbus A350-900s with six more purchase rights. The 737 MAX aircraft order came nearly five years after one of the airline&#x27;s fatal 2019 MAX aircraft crash that led to the grounding of the global fleet. Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines Mesfin Tasew stated; &quot;We have renewed our confidence in that aircraft. We believe we have checked and confirmed that the design defect of that aircraft has been fully corrected by Boeing.&quot; A 2023 report from Brand Finance, a global brand valuation and strategy consultancy firm, listed Ethiopian Airlines as one of the world&#x27;s top 50 most valuable and strongest airline brands ahead of Juneyao Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Jetstar and Spring Airlines. The firm named Ethiopian Airlines &quot;the fastest-growing airline brand globally, (brand value up 79% to US$498 million)&quot; and &quot;Africa&#x27;s largest airline brand&quot; with Qatar Airways as its significant challenger (brand value up 23% to US$2.5 billion).

===Forging strategic partnerships===
Ethiopian signed in July 2013 a deal for the acquisition of 49% of the Malawian carrier. The new airline was named Malawi Airlines. The remaining 51% shareholding held by the government of Malawi and private Malawian investors. Malawi Airlines started operations in January 2014. For the operation year 2013–14, Ethiopian Airlines was ranked the most profitable airline in Africa and the 18th most profitable airline in the world with a profit of $228 million.

In January 2018, Ethiopian signed a strategic partnership agreement with the Zambian government to assist in the relaunch of Zambia Airways. The airline has a 45% stake in the airline; the rest of the shares are held by the Zambian government. This move is aimed at developing Lusaka as an aviation hub for Southern Africa and fits with the airline&#x27;s multiple hub strategy outlined in its 15-year Vision 2025 strategic plan.

In February 2018, Ethiopian and its Togo-based regional airline partner ASKY Airlines formed a strategic partnership with the Guinean government to establish a startup carrier Guinea Airlines by June. This partnership is in line with the airline&#x27;s 15-year Vision 2025 strategic plan to establish strategic partnerships with many African countries, enabling them to regain market share for travel. It is also in line with the recently launched African Single Air Transport Market.

Ethiopian Cargo and Logistics Services has formed a joint venture entity with DHL, DHL-Ethiopian Airlines Logistics Services S.C. in 2018. The focus of the new company will be providing ground logistics to and from airports, seaports, and the rapidly expanding industrial parks of the region. The company is based in Ethiopia and carries out business all over Africa. The company has opened a container freight station, an 800 sqm facility at Modjo Dry Port, close to the capital, Addis Ababa. Ethiopian Cargo, the largest air cargo service provider in Africa, is building Africa&#x27;s largest and first of its kind e-commerce hub at $50 million cost at its facility in Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. Upon completion, the e-commerce hub will be equipped with an automated sortation system and electronic transport vehicles (ETV) to handle up to 23 million parcels per annum (150,000 tons per year) of shipments ranging from small parcels to boxes, skids, and built-up units. The airline has also partnered with postal firm MailAmericas, a Latin American company, to develop cross-border e-commerce services within Africa and the Middle East using Addis Ababa as a hub. The tie-up will see Ethiopian Airlines offer MailAmericas its air transport services for carrying goods across its network. As part of the partnership, Ethiopian Airlines will gain access to all bilateral agreements and private networks of MailAmericas, enabling it to offer services to customers in Africa, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and other parts of the world.

The business growth continued with an announcement, in April 2018, of a planned aerospace manufacturing facility. There is a small existing unit, under Ethiopian MRO Services, that manufactures wire harnesses for Boeing. The new division, a joint venture with Aerosud of South Africa, will be capable of designing, and manufacturing, aircraft parts for plane makers. Negotiations are underway with Boeing, Honeywell, Airbus, and Bombardier Aerospace among others in search of clients. Accreditation will be sought from the FAA and EASA. The needed human resources will be groomed from the local technical schools and higher learning institutions. In July 2018, Ethiopian Airlines signed an agreement with German ACM Aerospace to set up a facility that will manufacture and supply aircraft seat covers, safety belts, carpets, and other interior parts. In 2023, The airline has signed a deal with the Ethiopian Investment Commission (EIC) and the Ethiopian Industrial Parks Development Corporation (IPDC) to build a new hangar in Addis Ababa for aircraft parts manufacturing through a joint venture with Boeing. The facility will be used to manufacture aerospace parts, including aircraft thermo-acoustic insulation blankets, electrical wire harnesses, and other parts. Ethiopian airlines had inaugurated a manufacturing facility in Addis Ababa in September 2022, to produce insulation blankets for Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in a joint venture with Italy&#x27;s Geven-SkyTecno. Ethiopian Airlines holds 51% and SkyTecno 49% of the new Joint venture company called &quot;Ethiopian Sky Technologies&quot; which intends to make the aerospace manufacturing company one of the key strategic business units of the airline alongside Ethiopian International flights, Ethiopian Express (domestic), Ethiopian Cargo and Logistics services, Ethiopian MRO, Ethiopian Aviation University, Ethiopian In-flight Catering, Ethiopian Skylight Hotel, Ethiopian airports, and Ethiopian Ground Services.

In 2021, the Ethiopian MRO facility in collaboration with Israel Aerospace Industries established a Passenger to Freighter Conversion Site for Boeing 767-300 Aircraft. The conversion site is to provide solutions in the field of converting passenger aircraft to cargo configuration, aircraft maintenance, and overhaul, staff training and guidance, as well as assistance in acquiring certification and licenses. The site, the largest and the first of its kind in the continent, completed its Boeing B767 freighter conversion in 2022, the first of the airline&#x27;s three similar aircraft due to be converted. After the start of the Covid pandemic, Ethiopian temporarily converted around 25 of its widebody passenger aircraft into freighters using its in-house MRO capability. The initiative boosted its cargo operations and enabled it to transport around 1bn doses of the COVID-19 vaccine worldwide.

Ethiopian Airlines launched a Mozambican subsidiary, Ethiopian Mozambique Airlines, in December 2018.

==Controversies==
===Ethnic profiling allegations===
In November and December 2020, Ethiopian Airlines was accused of banning or placing on leave those who are ethnic Tigrayans a minority, in relation to the Tigray War. The company denied the allegation, stating no employee was &quot;suspended or terminated due to their ethnic background&quot;. A December 2020 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed the airlines&#x27; CEO, Tewolde Gebremariam, who is of Tigrayan origin, was also banned from leaving Ethiopia after the Tigray War started. Tewolde has been seen and interviewed at international events in October 2021.

===CNN allegations of military activities===
A CNN investigation alleged that cargo aircraft belonging to the airline transported weapons to airports in Eritrea during the Tigray War. The airline billed Ethiopia&#x27;s Ministry of Defense at least six times in November 2020. The article&#x27;s reporter claimed that using civil aircraft to &quot;smuggle&quot; military weapons violates international aviation law. However, CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo explained in a subsequent interview that it is not a violation of international law for commercial airlines to provide cargo services to governments in times of war. Ethiopian Airlines denied transporting weapons for the war and stated the goods transported were &quot;food stuff and refill&quot;. On 7 October 2021, a since-deleted post on Ethiopian Airlines&#x27; Facebook page quoted the CEO as saying the airline had started an investigation of &quot;treasonous&quot; employees and that the airline &quot;will continue fulfilling demands of the government. The airline later stated that the Facebook account was temporarily compromised and the posted statement was fake.

====Government possible involvement regarding China-Airline stake====
In 2023, Girma Wake, the airlines&#x27;s current chairman and former CEO of the airlines: has resigned, and has been replaced by current Ethiopian Airforce Marshal Yilma Merdassa. This has been speculated that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed replaced such a key airline figure because Girma denied the PM&#x27;s purpose to sell the airline&#x27;s cargo department to China. When asked regarding the replacement of civilian board chairman by a military officer, the Ethiopian GCEO said &quot;that would not change how the airline conducts its business. Ethiopian Airlines executive management is intact, We don&#x27;t anticipate any change. The new chairman will not alter that. We&#x27;ll work with him; he&#x27;s a pilot, and he knows about aviation, but from the military side. We don&#x27;t expect the Air Force chief to intervene or interfere in our day-to-day management.&quot;

===Transportation of wild animals===
In 2021, Ethiopian Airlines was one of a handful of carriers accused in a World Animal Protection report of involvement in the global export of live wild-caught animals, including species of ‘high biosecurity concern’, such as bats and primates. The NGO reported concerns that Ethiopia Airlines in particular was not operating in compliance with International Air Transportation Association (IATA) Live Animal Regulations.

In 2024, PETA launched a campaign against the carrier&#x27;s alleged treatment of animals, and two PETA representatives and an 11-year-old boy were detained by Ethiopian authorities for over 24 hours after planning a protest outside the carrier&#x27;s headquarters in Addis Ababa in July. Shortly thereafter, Ethiopian Airlines CEO Mesfin Tasew stated that the airline has been transporting live animals, such as monkeys, sheep, goats, fish, cows, and bulls, in full compliance with international aviation laws and regulations. &quot;We transport live animals as long as payment is effected and they are transported by a legal entity,&quot; he said.

<text>FUDOFSI (), headed by Constant Chevillon (1880–1944), was a federation of independent esoteric orders similar to FUDOSI, but strongly opposed to the other group.

==History==
FUDOFSI was established in defense of the Orders of Lyon and other societies that were not involved with FUDOSI. FUDOFSI was strongly opposed to FUDOSI, Harvey Spencer Lewis and his organisation Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC). Very little information is known about FUDOFSI since neither the organisation or its leader survived the Second World War (in 1944, Constant Chevillon, the head of FUDOFSI, was murdered by the Gestapo).

==First meeting==
The first meeting of FUDOFSI took place in Paris in February 1939.

List of people present:
* Constant Chevillon
* Reuben Swinburne Clymer
* Count Jean de Czarnomsky
* Henri Dubois
* Henri-Charles Dupont
* Andre Fayolle
* Raoul Fructus (former member of the FUDOSI)
* Camille Savoir
* Alfred I. Sharp

Hans Rudolf Hilfiker-Dunn and Arnoldo Krumm-Heller joined FUDOFSI later.

== Organisations represented in the first convention of 1939 ==
* Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Misraïm
* Brotherhood of the Illumined Brethren of the Rose-Croix
* Eglise Gnostique Universelle
* Fraternitas Rosae Crucis
* Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua
* Order of Knight Masons Elus Cohen of the Universe
* Ordre de Saint Graal
* Ordre Kabbalistique De La Rose Croix
* Ordre Martiniste-Martineziste de Lyon
* Rite Ecossais Rectifie

==Dissolution==
FUDOFSI ceased to exist at some point during World War II. However, in 1947 some of its members contacted each other and tried to establish a new organisation. Hans-Rudolf Hilfiker and R. Swinburne Clymer (1878–1966) tried to create a &quot;Worldwide Alliance of Rosicrucian Orders&quot;. In Rio de Janeiro, Clymer successfully merged his organisation with Krumm-Heller&#x27;s. Hilfiker and Clymer had a meeting on May 7, 1947 and also on June 5, 1948, in Zürich, Switzerland at the hotel Baur au Lac. The Fraternitas Rosae Crucis official biography of Emerson Myron Clymer, son of R. S. Clymer, describes him as &quot;Supreme Grand Master of FUDOFSI&quot; after his father&#x27;s death, so it is possible that the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis considers FUDOFSI to have survived later.

<text>A criminal code or penal code is a document that compiles all, or a significant amount of, a particular jurisdiction&#x27;s criminal law. Typically a criminal code will contain offences that are recognised in the jurisdiction, penalties that might be imposed for these offences, and some general provisions (such as definitions and prohibitions on retroactive prosecution).

Criminal codes are relatively common in civil law jurisdictions, which tend to build legal systems around codes and principles which are relatively abstract and apply them on a case-by-case basis. Conversely they are not as common in common law jurisdictions. Where a jurisdiction is a federation, the subnational units of such jurisdiction may or may not use separate penal codes. For example, in India, the entire country (the federal government, states, and union territories) all operate under one criminal code, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and in Canada the process is roughly the same, with the entire country being subject to a single criminal code. However, in Australia, the federal government and the states operate under different criminal codes (for instance, New South Wales would not necessarily use the federal criminal code, but rather, its own criminal code.)
The proposed introduction of a criminal code in England and Wales was a significant project of the Law Commission from 1968 to 2008. Due to the strong tradition of legal precedent in the jurisdiction and consequently the large number of binding legal judgements and ambiguous &#x27;common law offences&#x27;, as well as the often inconsistent nature of English law, the creation of a satisfactory code became very difficult. The project was officially abandoned in 2008 although as of 2009 it has been revived. 

A statutory Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee for Irish criminal law met from 2007 to 2010 and its &quot;Draft Criminal Code and Commentary&quot; was published in 2011.

In the United States, a Model Penal Code exists which is not itself law but which provides the basis for the criminal law of many states. Individual states often choose to make use of criminal codes which are often based, to a varying extent, on the model code. Title 18 of the United States Code is the criminal code for federal crimes. However, Title 18 does not contain many of the general provisions concerning criminal law that are found in the criminal codes of many so-called &quot;civil law&quot; countries.

Criminal codes are generally supported for their introduction of consistency to legal systems and for making the criminal law more accessible to laypeople. A code may help avoid a chilling effect where legislation and case law appears to be either inaccessible or beyond comprehension to non-lawyers. Alternatively critics have argued that codes are too rigid and that they fail to provide enough flexibility for the law to be effective.

Jurisdictions of many countries, such as Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States, use different penal codes.

<doc id="394932" wikidata="Q3311934" url="?curid=394932" title="Fontanelle (album)">
<text>Fontanelle is the second studio album by the American punk rock band Babes in Toyland, released on August 11, 1992, by Reprise Records. It was the band&#x27;s first release on a major label, and their first recording to feature Maureen Herman on bass.

==Recording==
After extensive touring throughout 1991, the band entered the studio to record their major label follow-up to their debut album, &quot;Spanking Machine&quot;. Bassist Michelle Leon left the group in December 1991, shortly before the recording of &quot;Fontanelle&quot; began, due to the murder of Joe Cole, her then boyfriend. Maureen Herman was recruited as her replacement.

The album was co-produced by frontwoman and guitarist Kat Bjelland with Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth heading production. Brian Paulson was also studio engineer and the final product was mixed by Dave Ogilvie. The cover photo — an image of a naked doll held up in front of a mirror — was taken for the album by photographer Cindy Sherman.

The band has explained the album&#x27;s name as referring to the soft spot on the top of a baby&#x27;s skull, as well as to a little fountain used by fairies. It is also the name of a magician consulted by Gilles de Rais, the real-life murderer who inspired the fairy tale &quot;Bluebeard&quot;.

The process of recording the album is described in the book &quot;Babes in Toyland: The Making and Selling of a Rock and Roll Band&quot;, by Neal Karlen. Recording took place at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, and at Sorcerer Sound Recording Studios in New York City.

==Reception==
&quot;Fontanelle&quot; is Babes in Toyland&#x27;s most critically and commercially successful album, selling 220,000 copies approximately in the United States alone. Reviews of the album were very positive, with Steve Huey from AllMusic noting:
Measured by any standard, &quot;Fontanelle&quot; is a frighteningly primal record, one whose sheer ferocity Babes in Toyland never quite captured this convincingly anywhere else.

The album&#x27;s success also prompted them to tour more and were eventually offered a place on the Lollapalooza tour in 1993, playing alongside such acts as Tool, Primus, Alice in Chains, Dinosaur Jr. and Rage Against the Machine. During dates at Lollapalooza, the band released their third and final EP, &quot;Painkillers&quot;, in June 1993, which consisted of a re-recording of one of their most notable songs &quot;He&#x27;s My Thing&quot;, and outtakes from &quot;Fontanelle&quot;.

<doc id="394934" wikidata="Q7871243" url="?curid=394934" title="USS Lexington (1776)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Lexington&quot; of the Thirteen Colonies was a brig purchased in 1776. The &quot;Lexington&quot; was an two-mast wartime sailing ship for the fledgling Continental Navy of the Colonists during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).

==History==
Originally named the Wild Duck, Abraham van Bibber purchased her for the Maryland Committee of Safety, at St. Eustatius in the Dutch West Indies in February 1776. She soon got underway for the Delaware Capes and reached Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 9 March with a cargo of sorely needed gunpowder for the patriot forces. Four days later, the Marine Committee purchased &quot;Wild Duck&quot;, renamed her &quot;Lexington&quot; after the Battle of Lexington (the first battle of the war), and turned her over to Wharton and Humphry for fitting out.

Commanded by Capt. John Barry, &quot;Lexington&quot; dropped down the Delaware River 26 March and slipped through the British blockade 6 April. The following day she fell in with British sloop &quot;Edward&quot;, a tender to the frigate . After a fierce fight which lasted about an hour &quot;Edward&quot; struck her colors. &quot;Lexington&quot; took her prize into Philadelphia and as soon as the ship was back in fighting trim, Barry put to sea again. On 26 April &quot;Lexington&quot; encountered Sir Peter Parker&#x27;s fleet sailing to attack Charleston, South Carolina. Two of the British ships gave chase on 5 May off the Delaware Capes. and chased &quot;Lexington&quot; for eight hours and came close enough to exchange fire with the American ship before Barry managed to elude his pursuers and reach Philadelphia safely.

&quot;Lexington&quot; and dropped down the Delaware to Cape May on the 20th, there joining and . &quot;Liverpool&quot; stood off the Delaware Capes preventing the American ships from escaping to sea. On 28 June Pennsylvania&#x27;s brig &quot;Nancy&quot; arrived in the area with 386 barrels of powder in her hold and ran aground while attempting to elude British blockader &quot;Kingfisher&quot;. Barry ordered the precious powder rowed ashore during the night leaving only 100 barrels in &quot;Nancy&quot; at dawn. A delayed action fuse was left inside the brig, which exploded the powder just as a boatload of British seamen boarded &quot;Nancy&quot;.
This engagement became known as the Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet.

On 10 July &quot;Lexington&quot; slipped to sea. On the 27th she captured &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, a ship of Lord Dunmore&#x27;s Tory Fleet which operated out of the Chesapeake Bay. This privateer was commanded by William Goodrich, a member of the notorious Tory family which had plagued the shipping of Virginia and Maryland. (Richard Dale, one of seven members of the &quot;Lady Susan&quot; crew who signed on Lexington, later won fame under John Paul Jones.) Early in September, &quot;Lexington&quot; took another sloop, &quot;Betsy&quot;. About a fortnight later lightning struck &quot;Lexington&quot; forcing the brigantine home for repairs. &quot;Lexington&quot; anchored off Philadelphia 26 September, and two days later Barry relinquished command.

With repairs completed, &quot;Lexington&quot;, Capt. William Hallock in command, got underway for Cape Francois to obtain military cargo. On the return voyage, British frigate overhauled the brigantine just short of the Delaware Capes 20 December and captured her. The commander of the frigate removed &quot;Lexington&quot;&#x27;s officers, but left 70 of her men on board under hatches with a prize crew. But by luring their captors with a promise of rum, the Yankee sailors recaptured the ship and brought her to Baltimore.

&quot;Lexington&quot;, now with Capt. Henry Johnson in command, sailed for France 20 February 1777 and took two prizes before reaching Bordeaux in March. In France, the brigantine joined &quot;Reprisal&quot; and for a cruise seeking the Irish linen fleet scheduled to leave Dublin early in June. The American ships, commanded by Capt. Lambert Wickes, got underway 28 May and were carried far to westward by heavy winds. Approaching Dublin from the north they entered the north channel 18 June and hove to off the Mull of Kintyre. During the next four days they captured nine prizes, sinking three, releasing one, and retaining five. Heading south again on the 22nd, they took and scuttled a brig before arriving off Dublin Bay. The next morning they took another brig and released a ship bringing sugar, rum, and cotton from Jamaica. After placing prize crews on both vessels, they resumed their voyage around Ireland. On the 24th they stopped and released a smuggler and the next day took their last prize, a snow.

When they sighted ship-of-the-line near Ushant on the 26th, the American ships scattered and made their way individually to safety in France. &quot;Lexington&quot; remained at Morlaix, a Brittany fishing village, throughout the summer, hemmed in by British warships. However, France, under strong British diplomatic pressure, ordered the American ships out of French waters 12 September. &quot;Lexington&quot; got underway the next morning but made little headway because of light wind. She lay becalmed near Ushant on the morning of 19 September when British 10-gun cutter , commanded by John Bazely, came into view. In the ensuing fight, &quot;Lexington&quot; rigging was seriously damaged, precluding flight. When the American brigantine ran out of powder, Captain Johnson reluctantly struck his colors.

<text>Bellarmine University ( ; BU) is a private Catholic university in Louisville, Kentucky. It opened on October 3, 1950, as Bellarmine College, established by Archbishop John A. Floersh of the Archdiocese of Louisville and named after Saint Robert Bellarmine. In 2000, it became Bellarmine University. The university is organized into seven colleges and schools and confers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in more than 50 academic majors, along with seven doctoral degrees; it is classified among &quot;D/PU: Doctoral/Professional Universities&quot;.

The university has an enrollment of around 3,000 students on its main academic and residential campus in Louisville&#x27;s Belknap neighborhood.

Its athletic teams are known as the Knights. Bellarmine is a member of NCAA Division I and competes in the ASUN Conference, with exceptions in: wrestling (Southern Conference), field hockey (Mid-American Conference), and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving (Coastal Collegiate Sports Association). Bellarmine&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2011 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division II Basketball Tournament, the first athletic national championship in school history. In only its second year in Division I, the Bellarmine men&#x27;s basketball team captured the ASUN Championship in 2022.  

==History==
===Early history===
Bellarmine University has been led by four presidents: Alfred Horrigan (1950–1972), Eugene V. Petrik (1973–1990), Joseph J. McGowan (1990–2016), and Susan M. Donovan (2017–present). Horrigan, elevated to Domestic Prelate by the pope in 1955, led the school during its formative years. Petrik strengthened Bellarmine&#x27;s financial footing. McGowan led the school in a massive building program, culminating in his Vision 2020 plan. Raymond J. Treece served as interim president in 1972–73, between presidents Horrigan and Petrik. John Oppelt served as acting president during McGowan&#x27;s sabbatical in 1999.

The first important public announcement of the establishment of Bellarmine College was made in November 1949 by the Archbishop of Louisville, John A. Floersh. He selected Horrigan and Treece, associate editors of the Louisville Archdiocesan newspaper, &quot;The Record&quot;, to begin the school. The two designed a curriculum and the school&#x27;s core philosophy, taking cues from The Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, and seeking advice from a number of Catholic institutions, including the University of Notre Dame, the University of Scranton, and the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas.
In 1950, The Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville founded Bellarmine College with a pioneer class of 115 freshmen. The only building, Pasteur Hall, was still without its front door on the first day of classes. Archbishop John A. Floersh called the school into existence at its first Convocation, saying, &quot;We are looking forward to the day when the college ranks with the great colleges of our country.&quot; From its opening day under founding president Horrigan, Bellarmine welcomed people of all faiths and races. In 1953 the college added the Administration Building (now Horrigan Hall). At its first commencement in 1954, Bellarmine graduated 42 students. The Korean War interrupted or ended the educations of many in the pioneer class, but the school persevered despite rumors of closure. In December 1956, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools formally announced Bellarmine&#x27;s accreditation. Enrollment rose from the initial 115 in 1950 to 1,033 in 1959.

===Expansion and growth===
The 1960s was an era of growth for the university. The university added Knights Hall, Bonaventure Hall, Lenihan Hall, Newman Hall, Kennedy Hall, an addition to Pasteur Hall and a small student activities building. 1963 witnessed the arrival of students from 17 states and 2 foreign countries. In 1964 the school awarded its 1,000th diploma. By the end of the decade, enrollment exceeded 2,000 and the college installed its first computer.

In 1967, Thomas Merton designated Bellarmine as the official repository of all his manuscripts leading to the formation of Bellarmine&#x27;s Catholic identity in the inclusive Merton spirit. And in 1968, Bellarmine College merged with Ursuline College, becoming coeducational and independent of the Archdiocese. The college now had its own self-perpetuating board of trustees.

In May 1971, president Horrigan issued a report describing the state of Bellarmine College, especially in light of the Second Vatican Council, noting that the school&#x27;s board of trustees consisted of representatives from a number of groups, reflecting the &quot;open, progressive, ecumenical and experimental spirit&quot; of that papal council. Also mentioned were various distinctions Bellarmine&#x27;s students had achieved, including 14 Woodrow Wilson Fellowships, 7 National Science Foundation fellowships, 3 Fulbright Scholars, and 2 Danforth Fellowships and two East-West Fellowships, achievements he attributed to Bellarmine&#x27;s commitment to excellence.

The college welcomed its second president when Horrigan resigned in 1972. His vice president, Raymond J. Treece, served as interim president for one year. Enrollment had fallen sharply, to 1,306 by 1973, and several years of deficit budgets put the school at risk of closure. The board of trustees appointed Eugene V. Petrik of California to the presidency in 1973 and he quickly began to revitalize the college with new programs and directions. He added the first graduate program – the MBA in 1975 – found resources for marketing and publicity, and brought enrollment back above 2,000. The school also added women&#x27;s basketball in 1973, and men&#x27;s soccer and women&#x27;s volleyball in 1976.

The 1980s saw another decade of growth. Enrollment rose from 2,284 to 2,660. The Brown Activities Center (named for George G. Brown), Wyatt Center for the Arts (named for Wilson W. Wyatt), Norton Fine Arts Complex (named for Jane Morton Norton), Alumni Hall (Humanities Building), and Maurice D.S. Johnson quadrangle (named for former board chair) were added during these years, along with the W. Fielding Rubel School of Business and the Donna and Allan Lansing School of Nursing and Health Sciences (1984). The subject of changing the name of the school from Bellarmine College to Bellarmine University was broached, but it was decided that the school should become a university in fact before it became one in name. More opportunities were added for women to participate in athletics, including softball, track, cross country, tennis and field hockey. A $20 million capital campaign propelled the college into the 1990s.

===Recent history===
Joseph J. McGowan, became Bellarmine&#x27;s third president in 1990. McGowan named buildings on campus for his predecessors, Horrigan and Petrik, and oversaw the addition of Miles Hall and the W.L. Lyons Brown Library. The Annsley Frazier Thornton School of Education was added in 1998 and the college added women&#x27;s soccer and women&#x27;s golf. The decade also saw the beginning of Bellarmine&#x27;s transition from a commuter school to a residential college. In 1995, a record 396 students lived in residence halls. In 1991, McGowan began instituting change in the form of a Five Year Strategic Plan, which later became the Master Plan. In 1994, the school began making perennial appearances in the &quot;Princeton Review&quot; and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, which both list Bellarmine among the top regional universities.

In 2000, the school&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the board of trustees changed the name from Bellarmine College to Bellarmine University to reflect its status as a Masters-I university. The university&#x27;s subsequent strategic plan, Vision 2020, called for tripling enrollment, doubling the number of buildings on campus, and adding schools of architecture, law, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine by 2020. In addition, the possibility of moving the remaining athletic programs to NCAA Division I (joining lacrosse) was considered. Acquisitions and renovations continued, including Our Lady of the Woods Chapel, The President&#x27;s Residence in Glenview, the 2120 Building, the Norton Health Sciences Center (named in honor of Norton Healthcare support), The Siena Residence Halls complex, Owsley B. Frazier Stadium, Joseph A. and Janet P. Clayton Field, Via Cassia and Ponte Juneja, and the expansion of Miles Hall. Enrollment reached a record 2,881 students by 2009, with more than 700 in residence on the campus. Bellarmine launched many new academic programs including The School of Continuing and Professional Studies, the Institute of Media, Culture and Ethics and the School of Communication, The Center for Regional Environmental Studies and Bellarmine Farm.
Growth at the university includes 20 new academic programs, a 60% increase in full-time enrollment, and a 56% increase in the number of residential students. The campus was expanded from 15 buildings in 1990 to 40 buildings, winning 11 architectural awards. Future plans include a new life fitness and recreation center with an Olympic pool, and Bellarmine Centro, a campus center to be anchored by an extensively remodeled Horrigan Hall connected to three new buildings.

McGowan died on March 1, 2016. Bellarmine&#x27;s executive vice president, Doris Tegart, was appointed the university&#x27;s interim president, with a national search planned for a new president.

In February 2017, the board of trustees unanimously selected Susan M. Donovan as the university&#x27;s fourth president. She assumed the presidency on June 1, 2017, following a long career at Loyola University Maryland. Under Donovan&#x27;s tenure, the school cut nearly a dozen majors. In May 2023, the faculty held a vote of no confidence in President Donovan, citing the school&#x27;s &quot;dire fiscal realities&quot; and the president&#x27;s &quot;poor financial decisions&quot;.

The multi-purpose stadium serves as home to Bellarmine&#x27;s soccer, field hockey, lacrosse, and track and field teams. The stadium opened on August 24, 2007, in a Bellarmine Knights women&#x27;s soccer game, and was officially dedicated on August 28. Construction took approximately 18 months and cost $5.1 million. The stadium features Joseph P. and Janet A. Clayton Field, which is composed of artificial turf with permanent markings for soccer, field hockey and lacrosse games. Surrounding the field is an eight-lane, 400 meter track. The track has a dual-durometer, polyurethane poured surface provided by Beynon Sport Surfaces, a company that has installed tracks at other college facilities including Illinois, Maryland, and Purdue.

===Our Lady of The Woods Chapel===
The chapel was dedicated on May 11, 2001, as a place of worship for Bellarmine students. Alfred Horrigan, the original president of Bellarmine University, always dreamed of building a chapel on campus. Although the project was not completed under his presidency, his vision for the chapel was respected during construction. Construction for Our Lady of the Woods was completed under Joseph McGowan&#x27;s presidency and stands in memory of Archbishop of Louisville John A. Floersh, who founded Bellarmine in 1950. Although construction was completed in 2001, Alfred Horrigan did not consider the project complete until he published the book &quot;Our Lady of the Woods Chapel&quot; just before his death in 2005. 
The interior building has two large stained glass windows, designed by Guy Kemper, an artist from Lexington, KY. The stained glass windows reflect different colors depending on the season and weather. On a bright day, you are more likely to see the blue and white reflections while the gray and lead are reserved for winter weather. The green and yellow of the stained glass are evident through most of the seasons with the exception of winter when the bare branches cast an illusion of intermingling with the lead. The majestic purple is always present, allowing visitors focus and peace. Stations of the Cross can be seen etched into the walls of the chapel. They depict the 14 stops that Jesus made on his way to the cross where He was crucified. 
Outside of the chapel is the Grotto. It is located down the steps that lead to a little nook tucked away beneath the chapel. There you&#x27;ll find a wall of candles surrounding a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes. Bellarmine provides candles to give students, staff, and alumni a chance to light a candle and meditate.
The surrounding community celebrates Mass in the chapel on Sundays and holy days of obligation, and uses the chapel for retreats and interfaith services. Because it does not have parish status, its use is restricted. No weddings, baptisms, or funerals are held there. There is no &quot;Our Lady of the Woods&quot; in Catholic tradition. The statue in the chapel is actually Our Lady of Grace. Bellarmine College&#x27;s earliest administrators had a particular devotion to Mary and suggested the chapel be named for her. Because of its setting, the chapel committee chose the name &quot;Our Lady of the Woods.&quot; 

===Siena Complex===
The Siena Complex is composed of four residence halls: Siena Primo, Siena Secondo, Siena Terzo and Siena Quarto. The complex is modeled after the Piazza del Campo, the main town center of Siena, Italy. Bellarmine&#x27;s namesake, St. Robert Bellarmine, was a native of Tuscany, where Siena is. The Siena buildings were built by F.W. Owens Co. Inc. and designed by Godsey Associates Architects Inc. They have private restrooms, wireless Internet access, kitchens, balconies, laundry facilities, group study spaces, lobby gathering areas, and a 200-seat dining hall. When completed, the four buildings will enclose a landscaped courtyard with fountains, a small amphitheater and possibly bocce courts. The &quot;Siena Housing Project&quot; is a project to have half of the school&#x27;s undergraduate population live on campus. Cumulatively, the Siena Complex will house 519 students and cost $33.6 million. 

===University Dining Hall===
In 2010 Bellarmine opened a new 540-seat, dining hall. It features indoor and outdoor seating areas with a tall panoramic window that provides natural light and view of rolling hills. It was built as part of a $7.5 million overhaul of the George G. Brown Center, which also includes a renovated and expanded School of Communication and the Amelia Brown Frazier Convocation Hall. The dining hall is managed by Sodexo Inc., which operated the previous cafeteria.

===Knights Hall===
Knights Hall is home to Bellarmine&#x27;s volleyball team and men&#x27;s wrestling team; the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams practice in Knights Hall but play in Louisville&#x27;s Freedom Hall as of 2020. The arena was built in 1960 and can seat up to 2,196 fans. It is also used for high school games, graduation ceremonies, and concerts. The hall was dedicated in 1960 with a home game against the University of Louisville and has hosted matchups with rival and NAIA national champion Kentucky State, Fly Williams and his teams from Austin Peay, and the Knights women&#x27;s basketball regional championship games of the 1990s. The Bellarmine men&#x27;s basketball team won back-to-back NCAA Division II Midwest Regional Tournaments in 2011 and 2012 at Knights Hall, and then again in 2015 and 2017. The women&#x27;s basketball team hosted the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Regional Tournament in the venue in 1986 and 1990, both of which were won by the Knights. In December 2010, Knights Hall played host to the quarterfinal, semifinal, and national championship matches of the NCAA Division II Women&#x27;s Volleyball Championship. Concordia-St. Paul defeated Tampa in four sets to capture their fourth consecutive volleyball title. The arena has also hosted some very special guests including Mother Teresa, the Grateful Dead, Jimmy Buffett and Pete Rose, among others. In 2007, Knights Hall was featured on ESPN when NBA greats such as Bill Walton, Darrell Griffith, and Kenny Walker judged the McDonald&#x27;s High School All-American Slam Dunk Contest. Additional speakers in the venue include Salman Rushdie (2005), Bob Woodward (2007), and Wendell Berry (2007). 

===The W.L. Lyons Brown Library===
The campus library was completed in the fall of 1996, costing $6.5 million. Its exterior is made up of brown brick, anodized aluminum-frame windows and slate roofs. It has long spanning brick arches with vertical piers, limestone columns and banding, steep sloping roofs, and a clock tower marking the entry, establishing a focal point on campus.

The library supports 150,000 volumes and includes a print and electronic-based reference center, micro forms, media services, periodicals, general collections, and a special-collections center. It houses the campus computer center and is wired throughout to promote flexibility in computer usage.

===Eddie Weber Tennis Complex &amp; SuRF Center===
The Eddie Weber Tennis Complex was dedicated on September 12, 2009, and is adjacent to the Student Recreation and Fitness Center (SuRF). The courts are named for Eddie Weber, the only man to have been a head coach for both the University of Louisville and Bellarmine. The complex houses 6 outdoor tennis courts with 3 additional indoor courts in the SuRF Center. Inside the SuRF Center are two multi-purpose basketball courts, the exercise and fitness area, locker rooms, and offices. The fitness area is supplied with treadmills, bikes, elliptical weight machines, and free weights. 

===Norton Health Science Center===
Bellarmine&#x27;s main science and research facility is the Norton Health Science Center (NHSC). NHSC was completed in 2004 and has of floor space. The floor space is divided into laboratories, faculty offices and classrooms. The facility also includes a courtyard for the science quadrangle. NHSC cost $6.5 million to build and was funded primarily by private donations.

===Horrigan Hall===

Horrigan Hall is named after the university&#x27;s first president, Alfred Horrigan, and serves as the campus center. Architects Thomas J. Nolan &amp; sons designed the facility in &quot;modern&quot; 1950s style and Al J. Schneider Company was the general contractor. The exterior is of rough textured brick with limestone trim. The three-story building sits atop a hill on campus featuring a six-story tower. Originally known as the Administration Building, Horrigan Hall was constructed in February 1953, costing $1 million. The facility was completely funded by private donations. Horrigan Hall has gone through a few remodeling and upgrades over the years. In December 1961 a new sound system was added, with central air following in 1970. In 1986–87 an elevator was installed and a new 2001 Newburg Road entrance was added as an alternative to the original 2000 Norris Place street entrance. Further remodeling and expansion is planned. Three new buildings have been proposed in front of and connected to the existing hall. The project is dubbed &quot;Bellarmine Centro&quot; and calls for the addition of more than of new space and approximately of remodeled space in the existing building. There will be space for a new Graduate School of Management, bookstore, admissions, registrar, bursar and financial aid offices. Classrooms will be added and expanded and a new space dedicated to triple the size of the Thomas Merton Center, the official repository of Merton&#x27;s manuscripts, which hosts approximately 3,000 research international scholars and visitors annually. A garden and green space will be added, including a green roof accessible to students and faculty. Bellarmine Centro is estimated to cost $38 million and will be funded entirely by private sources.

==Athletics==
The Bellarmine athletic teams are called the Knights. The university is a member of the NCAA Division I ranks, primarily competing in the ASUN Conference for most sports since the 2020–21 academic year. The Knights previously competed in the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) of the NCAA Division II ranks from 1978–79 to 2019–20.

Bellarmine competes in 25 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, sprint football, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading and dance.

;Notes:
===Overview===
Bellarmine sponsors five sports that are not sponsored by the ASUN, one of which will become an ASUN sport in July 2021. The men&#x27;s lacrosse team, the only NCAA Division I lacrosse team in Kentucky, is a member of the ASUN&#x27;s relaunched men&#x27;s lacrosse league. Bellarmine added men&#x27;s wrestling to its SoCon membership when it joined the ASUN. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving joined the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association (CCSA) upon the Knights&#x27; arrival in the ASUN. The women&#x27;s field hockey team was independent for its first Division I season in 2020–21, and became a single-sport member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) in July 2021.

===Accomplishments===
In 2011 the Knights won the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division II Basketball Championship. In 2015, the Bellarmine University Dance Team won their first national title at the 2015 NDA collegiate championship. In 2019, the team won their second national title at the 2019 NDA collegiate championship. In 2012 Bellarmine announced the start of its swimming program. The university&#x27;s newest sport is wrestling, added for the 2016–17 school year; Bellarmine effectively absorbed the wrestling program of St. Catharine College, an NAIA member that closed at the end of the 2015–16 school year. This returned NCAA wrestling to the state of Kentucky for the first time since the University of Kentucky dropped the sport in 1982. Bellarmine wrestling continues to compete in the SoCon after most other sports moved to the ASUN.

The Bellarmine Co-Ed Cheer Team also landed a national title in 2019, taking the &quot;Intermediate Small Coed Division II&quot; competition of the National Cheerleaders Association.

<doc id="394940" wikidata="Q7552995" url="?curid=394940" title="Bullseye (philately)">
<text>Bullseye, in philately, also called Socked on the nose (SON), refers to a cancellation of a postage stamp in which the postmark, typically a circle with the date and town name where mailed, has been applied centered on the stamp. The ideal bullseye has the entire postmark inside the margins, although this is not always possible, because the stamp may be too small or the postmark too large. The colloquial expression &quot;Socked on the nose&quot; does not seem to be used in Europe: the terms &quot;Oblitération centrale&quot; in French or &quot;luxus&quot; in German are in common usage.

Austria introduced ca 1868 a set of cancellations of small diameter (&lt; 20 mm), so that they could be seen entirely on all stamps.

Some philatelists and collectors of cancellations have a special interest in bullseyes primarily because the date, time, and place the stamp was used, or postmarked, can be identified by the cancellation. This allows specialised collectors to collect, for example, all of the postmarks of a particular country, state, city, county, date range, etc., without collecting entire covers.

There can be some confusion with the term &quot;Bullseye&quot; as it can mean both the type of cancel, such as the early American concentric ring cancel (as well as other countries that used them) and to have a cancel positioned right in the center of a stamp. So while an SON cancel is always near the centre of a stamp and can be an example of a Circular Date Stamp (CDS) or a &quot;Bullseye&quot; cancel or other shapes that were used as cancelling devices, (Square, Oval etc.) strictly speaking a &quot;Bullseye Cancel&quot; literally is a cancel that looks like a &quot;bullseye&quot;. 

Because modern machine cancellations are normally arranged so that the wavy lines, slogans, or other killers are applied to the stamp, leaving the postmark clear, dealers and collectors desiring SONs will position the stamp on the cover so as to fall under the postmark.

<text>White Buffalo Calf Woman (&quot;Lakȟótiyapi&quot;: &quot;Ptesáŋwiŋ&quot;) or White Buffalo Maiden is a sacred woman of supernatural origin, central to the Lakota religion as the primary cultural prophet. Oral traditions relate that she brought the &quot;Seven Sacred Rites&quot; to the Lakota people. 

== Story ==
The traditional story is that, 19 generations ago, there was a time of famine. The chief of the Lakota sent out two scouts to hunt for food. While the young men travelled they saw a white cloud in the distance. Then, from the cloud, they saw a woman. As they approached, they saw that it was a beautiful young Native woman in white buckskin. She had dark hair, dark skin and dark eyes. One of the men was filled with lust for the woman. He approached her, telling his companion he would attempt to claim her as a wife. His companion warned him that she appeared to be a sacred woman, and to do anything sacrilegious would be dangerous and disrespectful, but his advice was ignored.

The second man watched as the first approached and embraced the woman, during which time the cloud enveloped the pair. When the cloud disappeared, only the mysterious woman and a pile of the first man&#x27;s bones remained. The remaining man was frightened, and began to draw his bow. But the holy woman beckoned him forward, telling him that no harm would come to him, as she could see into his heart and he did not have the motives the first man had. As the woman spoke Lakota, the young man decided she was one of his people, and came forward.

At this time, the woman explained that she was &quot;wakȟáŋ&quot; (holy, having spiritual and supernatural powers). She further explained that if he did as she instructed, his people would rise again. The scout promised to do what she instructed, and was told to return to his encampment, call the Council, and prepare a feast for her arrival. She taught the Lakota seven sacred ceremonies to protect the Mother Earth and gave them the čhaŋnúŋpa, the sacred ceremonial pipe.

The seven ceremonies are: 
#Inípi (purification lodge)
#Haŋbléčheyapi (crying for vision)
#Wiwáŋyaŋg Wačhípi (Sun Dance)
#Huŋkalowaŋpi (making of relatives)
#Išnáthi Awíčhalowaŋpi (female puberty ceremony)
#Tȟápa Waŋkáyeyapi (throwing of the ball)
#Wanáǧi Yuhápi (soul keeping) 

Each part of the čhaŋnúŋpa (stem, bowl, tobacco, breath, and smoke) is symbolic of the relationships of the natural world, the elements, humans and the spiritual beings that maintain the cycle of the universe.

<text>António Artur Sanhá (born 1965) is a Bissau-Guinean politician. He was the Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau from 28 September 2003 to 10 May 2004 and also served as Secretary-General of the Party for Social Renewal (PRS).

== Career ==
Following the election of PRS leader Kumba Ialá as President, Sanhá was appointed as Minister of Internal Administration in the government named on 19 February 2000, under Prime Minister Caetano N&#x27;Tchama. In March 2001, the PRS wanted Ialá to appoint Sanhá, the Secretary-General of the PRS, as Prime Minister to replace N&#x27;Tchama, but Ialá resisted this, considering Sanhá too radical; he appointed Faustino Imbali as Prime Minister instead.

Sanhá was removed from his position as Interior Minister by Ialá in August 2001 following suspicions regarding the death of a woman, Florinda Baptista, with whom Sanhá was said to have been romantically involved, although Ialá did not give a reason for Sanhá&#x27;s dismissal. Sanhá said that he did not know the woman, but her family said that people close to Sanhá had forced her into having an abortion.

After Ialá was ousted in a military coup on 14 September 2003, the military junta chose Sanhá as Prime Minister of the transitional government, although its choice of Sanhá was opposed by 15 of the 17 involved political parties because Sanhá was not a political independent; concerns also remained about the 2001 incident. Sanhá was nevertheless sworn in as Prime Minister on 28 September in Bissau. His transitional government, which was planned to govern for six months prior to a new parliamentary election, was sworn in on 3 October. Following the parliamentary election, which was held in March 2004, a report accused Sanhá of interfering in the election and thereby causing disorganization to worsen; he defended himself by saying he had gotten involved &quot;only after things began to go wrong&quot;. A new government under PAIGC leader Carlos Gomes Júnior took office in May.

In June 2005, during protests by Ialá&#x27;s supporters alleging fraud in the first round of the presidential election, in which Ialá officially took third place, police fired on the protesters and arrested Sanhá, who was leading the march and was found by police to be carrying a loaded gun.

Sanhá was angered by the failure of the PRS to place his name at the top of the party&#x27;s candidate list for the November 2008 parliamentary election, and he resigned in October 2008. At a press conference on 21 October, he stated that he could &quot;no longer endure the injustice that prevails within the PRS&quot;, arguing that it was &quot;adrift because of some opportunists&quot;.

<doc id="394947" wikidata="Q1244568" url="?curid=394947" title="Hartland, Devon">
<text>The village of Hartland, whose parish incorporates the hamlet of Stoke to the west and the village of Meddon in the south, is the most north-westerly settlement in the county of Devon, England.

Now a large village which acts as a centre for a rural neighbourhood and has minor tourist traffic, until Tudor times Hartland was an important port. It lies close to the promontory of Hartland Point, where the coast of Devon turns from facing north into the Bristol Channel to face west into the Atlantic Ocean. There is an important lighthouse on the point. The town&#x27;s harbour, Hartland Quay, is to the south of the point: the quay was originally built in the late 16th century but was swept away in 1887. The high tower of the Church of Saint Nectan in Stoke remains a significant landmark for ships in the Bristol Channel. The appropriate electoral ward is called &quot;Hartland&quot; &quot;and Bradworthy&quot;. Its population at the 2011 census was 3,019.

==Communications==

Hartland is a convenient centre for walking parts of the South West Coast Path, and the wild coastal scenery around the point is some of the most dramatic on the path, with views across to Lundy Island. From Hartland Point, the Lundy Company operates its helicopter service to Lundy between November and March. The 319 bus service, a council-supported infrequent route operated by Stagecoach Devon, runs from Barnstaple to Hartland and return. There is also a 519 service, which runs to Bude.

==History and notable buildings==
The town was in the past known as Harton and was an unreformed borough, finally abolished in 1886. In medieval times there was an important abbey at Hartland, where the shrine of St Nectan was venerated. Hartland Abbey and the parish church are located some away in Stoke.

===Hartland Abbey===

Hartland Abbey was built in 1157 and consecrated by Bartholomew Iscanus in 1160 (Bartholomew was appointed Bishop of Exeter the following year). It was converted into an Augustinian abbey in 1189. In 1539 it was the last monastery to be dissolved by Henry VIII. The King gave the building to William Abbot, his Sergeant of the Wine Cellar at Hampton Court. William Abbot converted what had been the Abbot&#x27;s Lodging into a mansion. The present house incorporates a few components from Tudor times but is mainly the wing added to the old house in 1705 (the north-west corner being the work of &#x27;Mr Mathews&#x27; (according to the author of the &quot;Beauties of England and Wales&quot;). Further alterations were made in about 1860. The gardens were laid out by Gertrude Jekyll.

===Churches===
Saint Nectan, sometimes styled Saint &quot;Nectan of Hartland&quot;, was a 5th-century holy man who lived in Stoke. The Anglican church is St Nectan&#x27;s Church, Stoke, Hartland. The Roman Catholic Church (Our Lady and St Nectan&#x27;s Church, Hartland) was opened in 1964: it was also dedicated to St Nectan. The building was closed in 2010 due to no priests being available to celebrate mass there, and was demolished in 2012.

The Parish Church of St Nectan has the highest tower in Devon (), built in the late Perpendicular style. The church is large () and was built in the mid-14th century. Notable features include the fine Norman font, the rood screen (described as the finest in north Devon) and the old wagon roofs. The monuments include an elaborate medieval tomb-chest, a small brass of 1610 and a metal-inlaid lid of a churchyard tomb from 1618.

===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Hartland&quot; presumably derives from the Old English word &quot;heort&quot; for a deer (compare with Swedish &quot;hjort&quot; and Dutch &quot;hert&quot;), and it is therefore surprising that it is not more common in England. The many places in other English-speaking countries called Hartland probably bear witness to the historic importance of Hartland rather than being independent derivations, since the word &quot;hart&quot; was largely obsolete before the European discovery of the New World. Before the discovery of America, the word Hart was common in surnames. Family names such as Hartshorne were first mentioned in the Domesday Book. The nearby Hartland Point was named &quot;promontory of Hercules&quot; during the Roman occupation, which could have influenced the later naming of the village and parish.

Natural history The coast at Hartland is part of the North Devon Coast AONB. The British Geological Survey operates a magnetic observatory (one of three in the UK) just to the north of Hartland.

Television In early 2008, scenery and a cottage on the Hartland Abbey estate were featured in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. Episode 2 of the BBC&#x27;s 2016 adaptation of &quot;The Night Manager&quot; features Fore Street (Hartland&#x27;s main street, including the Anchor Inn pub, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Grocers and Heard&#x27;s Garage), Hartland Quay and the same Hartland Abbey cottage as featured in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.

Community magazine The &quot;Hartland Times,&quot; ‘A bi-monthly review of life in Hartland’, reported on events and village life. It was first published in 1981, taking inspiration from the &quot;Hartland Chronicle&quot;, a local newspaper written and edited by Thomas Cory Burrow from 1896 to 1940. Its editor was Tony Manley. The final edition was published in September 2014, after which Manley retired. The &quot;Times&#x27;&quot; successor, the &quot;Hartland Post&quot;, is published quarterly, with its first issue released in the winter of 2015/16.

<text>Samuel Archibald Anthony Hinds (born 27 December 1943) is a Guyanese politician who was Prime Minister of Guyana almost continuously from 1992 to 2015. He also briefly served as President of Guyana in 1997. He was awarded Guyana&#x27;s highest national award, the Order of Excellence (O.E.) in 2011.

He first became prime minister under Cheddi Jagan in 1992, following the October 1992 election, which was won by the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) welcoming Hinds and others (Civics) to work with them. When Jagan died in March 1997, Hinds became President himself, and appointed Jagan&#x27;s widow Janet as prime minister. For the December 1997 general elections, the PPP/C nominated Hinds as candidate for prime minister while Janet Jagan was the candidate for the presidency. Following the election, Janet Jagan was elected president and re-appointed Hinds as prime minister.

Prior to this, Hinds worked for the Alcan founded bauxite operation which was nationalized in 1971 rising to Vice President for Product Quality and Research and Development. By education, Hinds is a licensed and qualified chemical engineer, having graduated from the University of New Brunswick.

In August 1999, President Janet Jagan decided to resign, and temporarily replaced Hinds with Bharrat Jagdeo; Jagdeo thus became president upon her resignation, and he reappointed Hinds as prime minister. After the re-election of the government in the 28 August 2006 election, Hinds was sworn in as prime minister again in early September.

He was re-nominated as the 2011 prime ministerial candidate for the PPP in October 2011, although there were suggestions that he might step aside. After PPP/C candidate Donald Ramotar was elected president, Hinds was sworn in as prime minister again on 5 December 2011.

Following the opposition&#x27;s victory in the May 2015 general election, Hinds was succeeded as prime minister by Moses Nagamootoo on 20 May 2015.

Sam Hinds is honored in the scientific name of a species of lizard, &quot;Kaieteurosaurus hindsi&quot;.

Hinds has served as the Guyanese Ambassador to the United States since July 2021. He presented his credentials on 7 July 2021.

<doc id="394953" wikidata="Q2143963" url="?curid=394953" title="Yvon Neptune">
<text>Yvon Neptune (born 8 November 1946 in Cavaillon, Haiti) is a Haitian politician and architect who served as the Prime Minister of Haïti from 2002 to 2004. He was appointed by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and took office on 15 March 2002. He had previously served as President of the Senate from 2000 to 2002.

==Overview of activity from 2004==
On 2 March 2004, shortly after Aristide&#x27;s removal, a mob attempted to arrest Neptune on corruption charges, however it was unsuccessful. The mob was reportedly organized by Guy Philippe after Neptune gave an interview to Kevin Pina of KPFA Flashpoints in California and the Black Commentator, and Andrea Nicastro of the Italian daily &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;. In the interview Neptune claims he was not even present when interim-president Boniface Alexandre was sworn into office. He also referred to himself as a prisoner in his own office and backed Aristide&#x27;s claims that he was forced out of office under duress. U.S. Marines guarding his residence killed two gunmen there. Neptune was replaced on 12 March 2004 by an unelected provisional government led by Gérard Latortue, which had been appointed three days earlier.

On 27 March 2004, the provisional government banned Neptune from leaving the country, along with 36 other senior officials of the Aristide administration, in order to more easily investigate corruption allegations. On 27 June 2004, after hearing about a warrant for his arrest on the radio, Neptune turned himself into the Haitian police and was held without charge. According to the Haitian constitution, a hearing before a judge is required within 48 hours for anyone arrested, but Neptune was not given such a hearing. On 4 May 2005, Thierry Fagart, the chief of the human rights division at the UN&#x27;s Haiti mission, called Neptune&#x27;s detention illegal.

On 19 February 2005, Neptune was taken into protective custody by United Nations peacekeeping forces and handed himself back to Haitian authorities after a Port-au-Prince penitentiary breakout.

On 18 April 2005, Neptune began a hunger strike, refusing hospitalization and offers of medical attention abroad. On May 5, he was reported as being &quot;near death&quot;. On 23 June, Juan Gabriel Valdes - the UN&#x27;s special envoy to Haïti - criticized the Haitian government&#x27;s handling of Neptune and called for his release from prison.

On 14 September 2005, 14 months after Neptune was first imprisoned, a formal statement of charges against him appeared. He was accused of participating in the &quot;La Scierie Massacre,&quot; an alleged attack by Lavalas supporters in the La Scierie neighborhood of St. Marc. Subsequent investigations, including by the United Nations, revealed the massacre to be a struggle between two armed groups, with casualties on both sides. The Haitian Appeals Court prosecutor found that there was no credible evidence of Neptune’s involvement. Lawyers at the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights said that the statement of charges &quot;contain[ed] no indication that Mr. Neptune directly perpetrated the crimes alleged against him nor is there a clearly defined connection between Mr. Neptune and those who are alleged to have perpetrated the crimes...The mental and factual elements necessary to establish Mr. Neptune’s responsibility…remain entirely unclear.”

In May 2006, the Haitian prosecutor recommended dropping the charges against Neptune because there was no credible evidence to support them.

After spending two years in prison and never having been tried, he was released on 28 July 2006. The charges against him were not dropped; he was released on health and humanitarian grounds. Hundreds of other members or supporters of the deposed Aristide administration remained in custody without trial.

On 13 April 2007, the Appeals Court of Gonaives ruled that the courts had never had jurisdiction to try Neptune. Under Haiti’s Constitution, regular courts in Haiti cannot try high public officials unless the High Court of Justice has previously convicted them, a special court formed by the legislature, similar to impeachment in the United States. In September 2009, the Haitian Government served this decision on Neptune and the other parties. When the appeal period elapsed a few days later, the dismissal of all charges became official.

==Inter-American System Proceedings==

In April 2005, the Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti (IJDH), the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux and the Hastings Human Rights Project for Haiti filed a petition on Neptune&#x27;s behalf with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in Washington. In July 2006, the Commission ruled that the Government of Haiti&#x27;s treatment of Neptune violated his international human rights. The Commission referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR), an autonomous judicial institution of the Organization of American States based in San José, Costa Rica, for further proceedings.

On 6 May 2008, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that the State of Haiti violated 11 different provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights by illegally imprisoning former Prime Minister Yvon Neptune for two years and allowing the case to drag on in the courts for almost two more. The IACHR ordered Haiti to end what it called Mr. Neptune’s continuing “judicial insecurity” and to pay him $95,000 in damages and costs. The Court also ordered Haiti to start bringing its inhumane prisons in line with minimum international standards within two years.

“From the beginning, the State failed its obligation to protect Mr. Neptune’s right to be heard by a court competent to hear the charges against him…as well as to an effective recourse,” the IACtHR said in a 60-page judgment issued publicly on June 6. The Court denounced the State’s continued failure to bring Neptune before a qualified judge, thereby leaving him in a situation of “absolute judicial uncertainty.”

The IACtHR criticized nearly every aspect of Haiti’s prosecution of Neptune, which began in June 2004 and continues today. It found Neptune’s 25-month-long detention illegal, and the prison conditions he endured to be inhumane and degrading. Although Neptune has been out of prison since July 2006, the IACHR found that the violations of his rights continue because the case has not been dismissed, and he could be returned to prison at any time. The Court also condemned the State’s ongoing failure to provide Neptune a fair hearing. The ongoing violations amount to “an unjustifiable delay in access to justice,” the Court decided.

The IACHR found numerous other violations of Neptune’s human rights. Given the state courts’ lack of jurisdiction, Neptune’s rights against illegal imprisonment and arbitrary detention were violated. Because Neptune was jailed for 14 months before receiving a statement of the charges against him, the State violated his right to be informed within a reasonable time of the charges against him. And because the case against him has still not been resolved—more than four years after Neptune was imprisoned—the State stands in violation of Neptune’s right to be judged within a reasonable amount of time.

Haiti also violated Neptune’s rights by subjecting him to inhumane prison conditions, the IACHR found. The Court singled out the National Penitentiary’s overcrowding, squalor, and lack of general security, as well as multiple threats to Mr. Neptune’s life during his incarceration.

In total, the State violated 11 different provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights, the Court found. These are: Article 1.1, on the State’s duty to respect and ensure human rights; Articles 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4, concerning the right to humane treatment; Articles 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5, concerning the right to personal liberty; and Article 8.1, in conjunction with Art. 25, on the right to a fair trial and the right to judicial protection.

<doc id="394956" wikidata="Q494800" url="?curid=394956" title="Pak Pong-ju">
<text>Pak Pong-ju (; born 10 April 1939) is a North Korean politician who served as the Premier of North Korea from 2003 to 2007 and again from 2013 to 2019. He was elected a member of the Presidium of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea (WPK) in 2016.

==Early career==

Pak Pong-ju was born in 1939. Pak began his career in 1962 as manager of the Yongchon food factory in North Pyong&#x27;an Province. He became an alternative member of the ruling Korean Workers&#x27; Party (KWP) Central Committee in October 1980, and chief of the Namhung Youth Chemical Combine Committee in July 1983. In May 1993, he became vice director of the KWP&#x27;s Light Industries Department, and in March 1994, he was the vice director of the party&#x27;s Economic Policy Supervisory Department. In July of that year, Pak ranked 188th out of 273 members on the funeral committee of the late leader Kim Il Sung, indicating that he was on the periphery of the elite hierarchy. However, in September 1998, he was appointed to the chemical-industries portfolio under premier Hong Song-nam, and replaced him five years later.

==First Premiership (2004–2007)==

In 2005, in a plenary session of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly Pak spoke regarding the reintroduction of the public distribution system. Pak proposed an administrative solution to food distribution and labeled it the party&#x27;s position: &quot;By all means, we must reach this year’s grain production targets by thoroughly implementing the party’s policy of agricultural revolution by fully concentrating and mobilizing the entire country’s efforts into the agricultural front&quot;.

On 11 April 2007, the Korean Central News Agency reported that during the 5th session of the 11th Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly of the DPRK, Pak Pong-ju was &quot;relieved … of premiership&quot; and Kim Yong-il elected the new premier. He had not been seen in public since May 2006. It is rumored that he was removed from office because he misused oil funds to be used for the farming sector, or that he was too heavily focused on economic development suggestions from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, instead of home-grown ideas.

As Premier, Pak Pong-ju is the head of government in the DPRK, and formed the top executive leadership of the DPRK with other executive officials. The other branch of the executive government was the National Defense Commission of North Korea, led by Chairman of the National Defence Commission Kim Jong Un. As premier, he is responsible for organizing the cabinet and appoints ministers and vice-premiers upon confirmation by the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly. Prior to becoming Premier, Pak had served as Chemical Industry Minister. He serves as part of a committee heading the executive branch of the North Korean government, along with Kim Jong Un and SPA Presidium chairman Kim Yong-nam. Each man nominally holds one-third of the powers held by a president in most presidential systems. Pak handles domestic affairs, Kim Yong-nam conducts foreign relations and Kim Jong Un commands the armed forces.
On 23 August 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Pak Pong-ju &quot;resurfaced at a state function in the capital, Pyongyang, on Saturday, carrying the title of first deputy director of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, according to the North’s state-run Korean Central Television.&quot; He effectively replaced Kim Jong Il&#x27;s sister Kim Kyong-hui as director of the Party Light Industry Department in 2012 (he was its vice-director from 1992–1998 and 2010–2012).

He was reputedly close to Jang Sung-taek and part of the current shifting of the government&#x27;s attention to the consumer economy.

==Second Premiership (2013–2019)==
On 31 March 2013 he was elected to Politburo Standing Committee. On 1 April, he replaced Choe Yong-rim for a second term as Premier. On 22 April, he chaired the first full session of the cabinet which included a discussion of the &quot;&quot;byungjin&quot; line&quot; of co-developing the economy and nuclear weapons, as well as budgetary issues for the People&#x27;s Economy in the first and second quarters of 2013. In July, it was announced that Pak&#x27;s cabinet had taken full authority over economic measures by calling to &quot;unconditionally executing the cabinet’s decisions and instructions&quot;. On 11 April 2019, Pak was replaced by Kim Jae-ryong during the first session of the 14th Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly and given vice-chairmanship of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea.

==Post-Premiership==
Pak Pong-ju has been seen in the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, visiting the building on the 26th anniversary of the death of Kim Il Sung. During the 2022 celebration of the Day of the Foundation of the Republic, he participated in the central concert and banquet.

<text>The Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862 were a series of acts of Congress that promoted the construction of a &quot;transcontinental railroad&quot; (the Pacific Railroad) in the United States through authorizing the issuance of government bonds and the grants of land to railroad companies. In 1853, the War Department under then Secretary of War Jefferson Davis was authorized by the Congress to conduct surveys of five different potential transcontinental routes from the Mississippi ranging from north to south. It submitted a massive twelve volume report to Congress with the results in early 1855. However, no route or bill could be agreed upon and passed authorizing the Government&#x27;s financial support and land grants until the secession of the southern states in 1861 removed their opposition to a central route. The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 () was the original act. Some of its provisions were subsequently modified, expanded, or repealed by four additional amending Acts: The Pacific Railroad Act of 1863 (), Pacific Railroad Act of 1864 (), Pacific Railroad Act of 1865 (), and Pacific Railroad Act of 1866 ().

The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 began the practice of granting federal government owned lands directly to corporations; before that act, land grants were made to the states, for the benefit of corporations.

==Act of 1862, and amended 1864–65==

The original 1862 Act&#x27;s long title was &quot;An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes&quot;. It was based largely on a proposed bill originally reported six years earlier on August 16, 1856, to the 34th Congress by the Select Committee on the Pacific Railroad and Telegraph. Signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on July 1, 1862, the 1862 Act authorized extensive land grants in the Western United States and the issuance of 30-year government bonds (at 6 percent) to the Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad (later the Southern Pacific Railroad) companies in order to construct a continuous transcontinental railroad between the eastern side of the Missouri River at Council Bluffs, Iowa (opposite from Omaha, Nebraska) and the navigable waters of the Sacramento River in Sacramento, California. Section 2 of the Act granted each Company contiguous rights of way for their rail lines as well as all public lands within on either side of the track.

Section 3 granted an additional 10 square miles (26 km2) of public land for every mile of grade except where railroads ran through cities or crossed rivers. The method of apportioning these additional land grants was specified in the Act as being in the form of &quot;five alternate sections per mile on each side of said railroad, on the line thereof, and within the limits of ten miles on each side&quot; which thus provided the companies with a total of for each mile of their railroad. (The interspersed non-granted area remained as public lands under the custody and control of the United States General Land Office.) The U.S. Government Pacific Railroad Bonds were authorized by Section 5 to be issued to the companies at the rate of $16,000 per mile of tracked grade completed west of the designated base of the Sierra Nevadas and east of the designated base of the Rocky Mountains (UPRR). Section 11 of the Act provided that the issuance of bonds &quot;shall be treble the number per mile&quot; (to $48,000) for tracked grade completed over and within the two mountain ranges (but limited to a total of at this rate), and doubled (to $32,000) per mile of completed grade laid &quot;between&quot; the two mountain ranges Section 12 of the Act provided that the grades and curves were not to exceed the maximum grades and curves of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. 

The 30-year U.S. government bonds authorized by the act would be issued and backed by the U.S. government, which would then provide the capital raised to the railroad companies upon completion of sections of the railroads in exchange for a lien on that section. The liens covered the railroads and all their fixtures, and all the loans were repaid in full (and with interest) by the companies as and when they became due.

Section 10 of the 1864 amending Act (13 Statutes at Large, 356) additionally authorized the two charter companies to issue their own &quot;First Mortgage Bonds&quot; in total amounts up to (but not exceeding) that of the bonds issued by the United States, and that such company issued securities would have priority over the original Government Bonds.

The amending Act of March 3, 1865 ratified and confirmed the assignment made by Central Pacific Railroad to Western Pacific Railroad to construct the westernmost leg of the Pacific Railroad from Sacramento to San Jose and authorized Western Pacific as one of the charter companies.

From 1850 to 1871, the railroads received more than 175 million acres (71 million ha) of public land – an area more than one tenth of the whole United States and larger in area than Texas.

Railroad expansion provided new avenues of migration into the American interior. The railroads sold portions of their land to arriving settlers at a handsome profit. Lands closest to the tracks drew the highest prices, because farmers and ranchers wanted to locate near railway stations.

==Act of 1863==

The act of March 3, 1863 (12 Sta. 807) was:
:&quot;AN ACT to establish the gauge of the Pacific railroad and its branches.&quot;
:&quot;Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the gauge of the Pacific railroad and its branches throughout their whole extent, from the Pacific coast to the Missouri river, shall be, and hereby is, established at four feet eight and one-half inches.&quot;

This act set the gauge to be used by the railroads at four feet and eight and one-half inches, a gauge that had previously been used by George Stephenson in England for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (1830) and was already popular with railroads in the Northeastern states. Due in part to the 1863 Act the gauge would come to be widely (but not universally) adopted in the United States and is known as standard gauge. A common gauge choice allowed easy transfer of cars between different railroad companies and facilitates trackage rights between companies.

==Thurman Act==
An act of Congress (May 7, 1878, 20 Stat. 56), which became known as the Thurman Act, was an amendment to solve disputes over the railroad subsidies, revenues, and loan repayments consequential to the original act.

<doc id="394961" wikidata="Q7798464" url="?curid=394961" title="Through the Keyhole">
<text>Through the Keyhole is a British comedy panel game show created by the TV producer Kevin Sim and originally presented by Sir David Frost in the studio and Loyd Grossman on location. The location presenter explores celebrities&#x27; houses and a panel of other celebrities in the studio try to guess who the famous homeowner is.

The show was originally produced by Yorkshire Television and was broadcast on ITV from 3 April 1987 to 1 May 1995, then on Sky One from 22 February to 23 December 1996 before moving to BBC One from 5 May 1998 to 2004 and its sister channel BBC Two from 26 February 2006 to 4 June 2008.

In 2013, the show was revived for ITV with Leigh Francis as the host. In February 2020, it was reported that the programme had been cancelled after six series.

==History==
===Original series===
&quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; originally started as a segment on TV-am, first being broadcast on its launch day on 1 February 1983. The idea was created by Kevin Sim as a chance to look around some of the most influential homes with Grossman at the helm as the tour presenter. Grossman was mistakenly given the job after someone had confused him with another journalist. It became a regular feature of TV-am throughout 1983 until May 1985. 

In Spring 1986 Frost transferred the concept to Yorkshire Television who picked up format, to produce a full half-hour programme for ITV, where a celebrity panel tries to guess whose house is being looked at From 1987. It ran in primetime on Friday nights for eight years on ITV and was rarely out of the top ten entertainment programmes on TV. The executive producers were Kevin Sim and Chantal Rickards. From 1996, it was produced by Frost&#x27;s own production company, Paradine Productions, at Yorkshire Television. That same year, the show also moved to Sky One for one series. It then moved to BBC One &quot;Daytime&quot; in 1998 until 2004. The final three series aired on BBC Two from 2006 to 2008, when it was cancelled by the BBC. However, a special aired in March 2011 for &quot;Red Nose Day 2011&quot; as part of marathon panel show &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot;.

===Revival===

In 2013, the programme returned on its original broadcast channel ITV with Leigh Francis (in character as Keith Lemon) taking up the dual roles of studio presenter and house detective. The new series was filmed at Pinewood Studios until 2018, with series 6 filmed at the BBC Elstree Centre&#x27;s Studio D in the latter half of the year. Dave Berry was a regular panellist. The first episode of the revived series aired on the same day that former host Sir David Frost died, although the news did not break until the following morning.

Before his death in August 2013, Frost gave his backing to ITV&#x27;s remake, saying: &quot;I am delighted that the Keyhole format is now entering its fourth decade on TV. I know the pilot show went down very well with the studio audience and I wish Keith and his team the very best of luck for the series.&quot;

==Format==
At the start of each episode, Frost introduces a panel of three celebrities with the catchphrase &quot;And &quot;what&quot; a panel they are ...&quot; and some gently humorous or mocking descriptions. He then hands over to the location presenter who gives the panellists a guided tour of a property, noting particular items, though there is typically a large amount of involved as the items pointed out by the presenter are not necessarily the most pertinent clues to the person&#x27;s identity. Items not specifically mentioned may provide much more useful clues. Once completed, Frost reveals the identity of the guest to the audience and the panel are given turns at guessing their identity. The audience participate with varying degrees of applause according to the accuracy of the panellists&#x27; guesswork.

The panellists are either successful at identifying the guest or Frost reveals their identity, after which they are interviewed and given a key-shaped trophy as a memento. Starting during Loyd Grossman&#x27;s reign as location presenter, the geographic spread was extended with one of the properties on each episode being located in the US and one in Europe. When Stefanie Powers joined in 2007, she was based in the US and conducted the US property tours, whilst in the UK Lisa Snowdon conducted the European part.

<doc id="394962" wikidata="Q380681" url="?curid=394962" title="Goh Kun">
<text>Goh Kun (, born 2 January 1938) is a South Korean politician who served as the prime minister of South Korea from 1997 to 1998 and again from 2003 to 2004. He was also the acting president of South Korea at the time of Roh Moo-hyun&#x27;s suspension in 2004 and a former mayor of Seoul.

==Early life and education==
Goh Kun was born on 2 January 1938 in modern day Seoul, South Korea and attended Kyunggi High School from 1953 to 1956. In 1960, Goh earned a Bachelor of Science degree in political science from Seoul National University, where he was President of the Student Council. He returned to the university in 1968 and graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in 1971, majoring in urban planning.

==Career==
Goh began his career in civil service in the 1960s, when he joined the Ministry of Home Affairs as a probationary officer. He was promoted through various positions, including the Governor of South Jeolla from 1975 to 1979, the Minister of Transportation from 1980 to 1981 and Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1981 to 1982.

In 1985, Goh was elected as a Member of the National Assembly, before being appointed the mayor of Seoul in 1988. When he refused to approve a questionable development proposal in 1990, he was removed from office. However, he returned to the position in 1998, this time by election, and served until 2002. During his tenure, he initiated a &quot;10 million trees of life&quot; program in the Seoul and sought more aggressive emissions standards, which led to a significant greening of the city.

He served as Prime Minister of South Korea from 1997 to 1998 and from 2003 to 2004.

He assumed the role of interim President following President Roh Moo-Hyun&#x27;s impeachment, from 12 March 2004 until 14 May 2004, when the South Korean Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment decision and restored Roh&#x27;s powers as President. He resigned from the office of Prime Minister on 24 May 2004 after refusing to comply with the President&#x27;s request to replace cabinet members. He was succeeded in the office by Lee Hae-chan, who was approved on 30 June. Along with Goh, three other cabinet members were also replaced.

In June 2006, Goh announced his candidacy for the presidential race.

On 16 January 2007, he announced that he would no longer be a candidate for the presidential elections and that he would retire from political life. Despite his retirement, he was named head of social unity council by President Lee Myung-bak on 21 December 2009.

<text>Gmane (pronounced &quot;mane&quot;) is an e-mail to news gateway. It allows users to access electronic mailing lists as if they were Usenet newsgroups, and also through a variety of web interfaces. Since Gmane is a bidirectional gateway, it can also be used to post on the mailing lists. Gmane is an archive; it never expires messages (unless explicitly requested by users). Gmane also supports importing list postings made prior to a list&#x27;s inclusion on the service.

The project was initiated in 2001 by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen, one of the authors of Gnus, a newsreader for Emacs. It began operating publicly on 11 February 2002 after a one-month test period.

, Gmane&#x27;s homepage stated that it included 129,592,482 messages in its archives, from a total of 20,070 mailing lists.

In July 2016, Ingebrigtsen announced that he was considering shutting Gmane down, and the web interface was taken offline. In August 2016 Gmane was acquired by Yomura Holdings. Only the message spool was transferred, with the software behind the site having to be redeveloped. On the 6 September 2016, it was announced that the Gmane web interface would be coming online again. However, by February 2018 a LWN.net article observed that the web interface did &quot;never [...] return, breaking thousands of links across the net. The front page still says &#x27;some things are very broken&#x27; and links to a blog page that was last updated in September 2016.&quot;

In January 2020, the server hosting the e-mail to news service, still operated by Ingebrigtsen, needed to be moved following the sale of a company Ingebrigtsen had co-founded. Due to failure of the current owners of gmane.org to update a DNS entry—resulting in the unavailability of news.gmane.org—Ingebrigtsen obtained a replacement domain, codice_1, and migrated the 15,000 mailing lists to a new server at the new address using a combination of automation, volunteer labor, and manual processes. It is currently available only by newsreader as the website formerly operated by Yomura has not been recreated.

==Example==
codice_2 is an electronic mailing list for discussion concerning the English-language Wikipedia. Via the standard email interface, users post messages by emailing them to codice_3, and these are forwarded by email to everyone who subscribes to the list.

Gmane permits users to access this mailing list as if it were a Usenet newsgroup instead, by using the news server codice_4 and group name codice_5. Messages posted to the list by email will appear in the Gmane newsgroup, and vice versa.

==Spam protection==
Incoming mail is checked by SpamAssassin and anti-virus software so that spam and viruses are hidden or deleted. Outgoing mail is checked by TMDA to make sure that no spam will be posted to the lists using Gmane.

==Other list-archiving services==
Other services which can archive mailing lists include The Mail Archive, Nabble, MarkMail, MARC, MailBrowse, the old Google Groups user interface (the interface which was standard until 2012), Gossamer Threads, and OpenSubscriber.

<doc id="394966" wikidata="Q692848" url="?curid=394966" title="Democratic Representative Caucus">
<text>The Democratic Representative Caucus, also called the Democratic Representative Association, was a parliamentary group in the 37th Canadian Parliament consisting of Members of Parliament who left the Canadian Alliance in 2001 in protest against the leadership of Stockwell Day.

== Formation ==
Following the Alliance&#x27;s disappointing performance in the 2000 election, Day came under severe criticism from his own party, and several high-profile Alliance MPs began publicly calling for him to step down. Through the spring of 2001, several members of the Alliance resigned their shadow cabinet seats, the most high-profile resignation being that of deputy leader Deborah Grey.

On May 2, Art Hanger was the first Alliance MP formally suspended from caucus for criticizing Day. Over the next two months, 11 other Alliance MPs were either suspended from caucus or resigned. On May 16, Hanger was followed by Chuck Strahl, Gary Lunn, Jim Pankiw, Val Meredith, Grant McNally, Jay Hill and Jim Gouk. In late June, they were joined by Monte Solberg, Andy Burton and Brian Fitzpatrick, and in the first week of July by Grey and Inky Mark.

At this time Day attempted to solve the crisis by offering to take a temporary leave of absence from the leadership if the dissidents returned to the party, but he withdrew the offer after the dissident MPs refused his conditions. Through the summer, the MPs sat as &quot;Independent Alliance Caucus&quot;, and were jokingly dubbed the &quot;Rebel Alliance&quot; by political commentators.

In early September, a new offer was made to the MPs in which they would be readmitted to the Alliance caucus if they promised to refrain from criticizing Day&#x27;s leadership. The MPs surveyed their constituents, and the offer was accepted by Hanger, Gouk, Solberg, Fitzpatrick and Burton. The remaining seven MPs refused, and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus on September 12, with Strahl as its parliamentary leader and Grey as deputy leader. This was not intended as a new political party, but simply as a group caucus. The MPs immediately entered a coalition agreement with the Progressive Conservatives.

==Coalition with the Progressive Conservatives==
The PC-DRC Coalition was intended to be PC leader Joe Clark&#x27;s framework for proving that the two parties could be united on his terms rather than Day&#x27;s. To that end, Clark and Strahl tried to propose common policies that would appeal to both PC and Alliance members. Clark remained the leader of the coalition caucus, with Strahl as deputy leader and Grey as caucus chairwoman.

Two weeks later, on September 24, the &quot;Progressive Conservative - Democratic Reform Coalition Caucus&quot; made their formal debut in the House of Commons of Canada. Speaker Peter Milliken ruled that the arrangement would be recognized as a coalition, but would not gain all of the parliamentary privileges of being a unified party; for example, although the coalition caucus now had more MPs than the New Democratic Party, Milliken ruled that the coalition would not outrank the NDP in party precedence matters, such as speaking order or seating.

While the DRC members insisted that they remained loyal to the Canadian Alliance despite their opposition to Day&#x27;s leadership, the group founded the Democratic Representative Association (DRA) to support their re-election campaigns as DRC Members of Parliament.

On November 19, Lunn left the DRC to rejoin the Alliance shortly after Day agreed to hold a new Alliance leadership race, although the party forced him to issue a public apology for his role in the schism before readmitting him to the caucus. The remaining DRC members were formally expelled as members of the Canadian Alliance in December.

==End of the coalition==
In March 2002, Day lost that leadership race to Stephen Harper. In April five of the seven DRC members returned to the Alliance caucus, terminating their coalition agreement with the PCs. Pankiw&#x27;s request for readmission to the Alliance caucus was denied, as he was embroiled in a political controversy involving a violent confrontation with a First Nations constituent. Mark chose not to return to the Alliance caucus, instead sitting as an Independent Conservative, then joining the PC caucus in August.

==Conservative Party of Canada==
Clark&#x27;s successor, Peter MacKay, negotiated a merger with the CA in late 2003, and he, along with Mark and most of the PC caucus, joined with the CA caucus to form the Conservative Party of Canada, fulfilling the DRC&#x27;s main goal of a unified centre-right. Clark and a few other prominent PC MPs and senators refused to join the new party, whilst Pankiw was again refused admission along with another Saskatchewan CA MP, Larry Spencer.

<text>The Church of Jesus Christ in Zion is a small church in the Latter Day Saint movement based on the teachings of &quot;latter day prophet&quot; Kenneth Asay. The church is based on early teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

== History ==
The Church of Jesus Christ in Zion was established in 1984. Asay died in 1985, after which the church was taken over by Roger Billings. Billings incorporated the church in Missouri in 1989. As of 2004, the church was based in Independence, Missouri.

== Doctrine ==
According to Church doctrines, there was not to be a formal Church organization but rather individual families were to be the organizational units, presided over by a father or a family patriarch. The Church of Jesus Christ does not consider itself to be a Church organization as is the conventional model of our day. Rather, the Church claims to be a concept or a life plan by which individual families may find encouragement and support in their religious practice.

The Church adopted all of the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, including the teaching that any person who can &quot;bear testimony of Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Ghost&quot; is a prophet.

<text>Ranil Wickremesinghe (; ; born 24 March 1949) is a Sri Lankan politician who served as the ninth president of Sri Lanka from 2022 to 2024. Previously, he served as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 1993–1994, 2001–2004, 2015–2018, 2018-2019 and in 2022. He held several ministerial roles, including Minister of Finance, Minister of Defence, Minister of Technology and Minister of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment. Wickremesinghe has led the United National Party (UNP) since 1994 and has been Prime Minister of Sri Lanka on six occasions.

Born into a political family, Wickremesinghe graduated from the University of Ceylon and qualified as a lawyer from the Ceylon Law College in 1972. He entered politics in the mid-1970s with the UNP, first being elected to Parliament in 1977. Over the years, he held various ministerial positions, including Minister of Foreign Affairs, Youth Affairs and Employment, and Industry, Science and Technology. He first became prime minister in 1993 following the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa.

Wickremesinghe ran unsuccessfully in 1999 and 2005 presidential elections. In 2015, he was appointed prime minister by President Maithripala Sirisena, leading a coalition government until 2019. During his tenure, he faced a constitutional crisis in 2018 but was reappointed as prime minister after it was resolved. He lost his parliamentary seat in 2020 but re-entered Parliament in 2021 as a National List MP.

In May 2022, Wickremesinghe was reappointed as prime minister amidst a political crisis. Following the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in July 2022, Wickremesinghe became acting president and was subsequently elected as the 9th President of Sri Lanka by Parliament on 20 July 2022. He took office the following day. He attempted to run for a term in his own right in 2024 but failed to win reelection, finishing in third place with 17.27% of the vote.

== Early life and education ==
Born on 24 March 1949 in Colombo, Wickremesinghe was the second son of Esmond Wickremesinghe and Nalini Wickremesinghe née Wijewardena. His father was a lawyer who became a press baron taking over the Lake House Group of newspapers. His grandfathers were Cyril Wickremesinghe of the Ceylon Civil Service and the press baron, D. R. Wijewardhena.

Wickremesinghe was educated at the Royal Preparatory School and at the Royal College, Colombo where he was a classmate and friend of Anura Bandaranaike, son of then Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike; and Dinesh Gunawardena, son of socialist leader Philip Gunawardena. Wickremesinghe entered the Faculty of Law of the University of Ceylon at its Colombo Campus which is now the University of Colombo. After graduation, he completed the law exams at the Ceylon Law College and took oaths as an advocate in 1972 after having apprenticed under H. W. Jayewardene, QC. He became an Attorney at law following the changes to the legal profession in 1973. Wickremesinghe received an honorary doctorate from Deakin University in Australia on 14 February 2017 for his significant contributions in reforms in economy, education and human rights.

== Political career ==
Wickremesinghe joined the United National Party (UNP) and progressed through its ranks. He was appointed as the chief organizer of the Kelaniya Electorate in the mid-1970s, and was later appointed as the chief organizer of the Biyagama Electorate, which he won in the 1977 parliamentary elections and entered parliament. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in the new government of J. R. Jayewardene, and was soon promoted to the post of Minister of Youth Affairs &amp; Employment on 5 October 1977, which made him the youngest cabinet minister of Sri Lanka. During his term as minister, he initiated the Sri Lanka National Guard and the National Youth Services Council (NYSCO), which provides vocational and career training to school leavers. Wickremesinghe was later made the Minister of Education on 14 February 1980.

Under the presidency of Ranasinghe Premadasa, Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Minister of Industry on 18 February 1989, under which he initiated industrial reforms and established the Biyagama Special Economic Zone. In 1990, he was given the additional portfolios of Science and Technology. Wickremesinghe had competition from his senior colleagues in the UNP, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, who had been rivals of President Premadasa. He was appointed Leader of the House in 1989.

=== Batalanda incident ===

It was alleged by the People&#x27;s Alliance government that Wickremesinghe, as Minister, was the political authority behind an illegal detention centre in the Batalanda housing and industrial complex outside Colombo between 1988 and 1990 which was allegedly run by a government-backed counter-subversive unit as part of the state&#x27;s operation to put down an armed insurgency by the JVP. The People&#x27;s Alliance government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga appointed a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate activities of Batalanda and on 3 September 1997 Wickremesinghe was summoned to testify before the commission. The Commission&#x27;s report was released on 12 April 1998. The commission was a fact-finding mission and had no judicial powers; however, it recommended the government to &quot;bring the guilty to book&quot;. One of its findings was that &quot;Wickremesinghe and the SSP Nalin Delgoda, are indirectly responsible for the maintenance of places of unlawful detention and torture chambers in houses at the Batalanda Housing Scheme&quot;. It further stated that Wickremesinghe held &quot;unauthorised meetings of police officers involved in counter-insurgency operations in the housing complex, and that as such, he had abused his authority&quot;. No criminal proceedings took place thereafter.

=== First premiership (1993–1994) ===
On 7 May 1993, Wickremesinghe was sworn in as prime minister after President Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated by the Tamil Tigers and Prime Minister D. B. Wijetunga was appointed president. During his ephemeral term, he was credited for pushing the country through an impressive economic transformation and was generally backed by the business community.

=== Opposition (1994–2001) ===
In the 1994 parliamentary elections, the UNP lost to Chandrika Kumaratunga&#x27;s People&#x27;s Alliance (PA), and Kumaratunga was appointed Prime Minister of the country. Wickremesinghe was defeated in the race for Opposition Leader by two votes by fellow UNP member Gamini Dissanayake, who had re-joined the party. This gave Gamini Dissanayake the default leadership of the party and made him the presidential nominee of the UNP. The UNP was progressing well under Gamini Dissanayake&#x27;s leadership when he too was assassinated by the Tamil Tigers. Gamini Dissanayake&#x27;s widow, Srima Dissanayake replaced him as the candidate of the UNP in the 1994 election. Securing just 35% of the vote, she lost to Chandrika Kumaratunga in every electorate except Mahiyangana. Afterwards, Wickremesinghe was appointed as the opposition leader as well as the UNP leader.

Wickremesinghe was seen as a cooperative opposition leader who gave the government a chance to carry out its agenda in its early days.

==== 1999 presidential election ====
In the 1999 presidential election, Wickremesinghe was nominated as the UNP presidential candidate. After a tense election campaign in the wake of the violent North Western Provincial Council election, the Tamil Tigers carried out a suicide bomb attack in an election campaign rally, in which President Kumaratunga lost her right eye. Voting was held two days later on 21 December 1999 and amidst a wave of sympathy, Kumaratunga was re-elected to a second term with 51% of the popular vote. After this electoral loss, Wickremesinghe unsuccessfully led his party in the 2000 parliamentary elections, again losing out to the PA.

=== Second premiership (2001–2004) ===

In the 2001 parliamentary elections, Wickremesinghe led the newly formed United National Front (UNF) to victory, winning 109 seats compared to the PA&#x27;s 77 seats. Consequently, Wickremesinghe was able to form a new UNF government and sworn as the 17th Prime Minister of Sri Lanka on 9 December 2001. Chandrika Kumaratunga still remained the president of the country. This led to a confusing situation where the president and the prime minister were from two opposing parties. Although, according to the constitution, the president was both head of state and head of government, Wickremesinghe was able to appoint his own cabinet and he had the actual control over the government. President Chandrika Kumaratunga also chaired cabinet meetings as &quot;de facto&quot; head, but her influence over decision making was strictly limited.

During his second premiership, Wickremesinghe proposed to initiate the &quot;Western Region Megapolis&quot; project. Planned with the assistance of architects and town planners of a Singaporean firm CESMA, it proposed to build a large new city in the western province that can rival major cities in the world. However, the project did not proceed after the end of his government. He also requested the international community to assist in development during the ceasefire – the Tokyo Donor Conference on Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka was held in June 2003, during which Sri Lanka received more than 4.5 billion dollars in reconstruction and development aid.

Wickremesinghe&#x27;s foreign policy during his tenure as prime minister pushed closer relations with the West. He expected their economic backing to overcome the economic crisis. He also largely took assistance, especially from Norway, to resolve the ongoing ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. In July 2002 he was able to meet United States President George W. Bush. It was the first time a Sri Lankan leader met the US president in the White House in 18 years. This visit was primarily focused on building new relationships based on economical links between United States and Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the US government pledged to support his peace efforts with LTTE. He also met the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In September 2003, Wickremesinghe made his first official visit to Malaysia since taking office as prime minister. Over his two-day visit, he met with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Putrajaya and urged Malaysian investors to explore opportunities in tourism, infrastructure, and agriculture. He also reassured them about the positive developments in the peace process.

==== Peace talks ====
Wickremesinghe believed a political solution based on a United Sri Lanka was the permanent solution to the civil war in the country. He also believed that such a solution could be reached through a peaceful negotiation process with LTTE. Three months after the election, Wickremesinghe&#x27;s government entered a ceasefire agreement (CFA) with LTTE. The agreement was signed on 22 February 2002 at different locations in the war zone by both parties and the Norwegian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Jon Westborg acted as the facilitator. It was said that the main objective of this agreement was to find a negotiated solution to the ongoing ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. Both parties agreed to halt all offensive military operations. An international monitoring mission called the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) was formed to inquire into any instance of violation of the terms and conditions of this agreement. In the aftermath of signing the CFA, the island was deemed a safe place once again, after decades of war. The tourism industry in particular experienced a significant escalation where the number of tourists arriving in the country was suddenly increased. The A9 Highway was reopened up to Kilinochchi on 15 February 2002 after 18 years.

After signing the CFA, Wickremesinghe held a few rounds of peace talks with LTTE between 2002 and 2003. Prof. G. L. Peiris, minister Milinda Moragoda and minister Rauff Hakeem led the government delegation and LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham, LTTE political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan and military leader Karuna Amman led the LTTE faction during the peace talks. The Norwegian government acted as the chief facilitator during the peace talks. There were six rounds of peace talks which were held at different locations around the world:

# 16–18 September 2002, Bangkok
# 31 October-3 November 2002, Bangkok
# 2–5 December 2002, Oslo
# 6–9 January 2003, Bangkok
# 7–8 February 2003, Berlin
# 18–21 March 2003, Tokyo

After the Oslo round of peace talks in December 2003, a concluding statement was declared by the Norwegian facilitators which later became known as the Oslo Declaration. In this statement, it was stated that &quot;both parties have decided to explore a political solution founded on internal self-determination based on a federal structure within a united Sri Lanka&quot;. This was considered one of the most significant incidents in the history of finding a political solution to the ethnic problem in Sri Lanka.

After the sixth round of peace talks in March 2003, the LTTE abruptly withdrew from the peace talks. In October 2003, the LTTE again showed some intentions of entering into the peace process, calling for an Interim Self Governing Authority (ISGA). The proposal was handed over to the government through Norwegian Ambassador Hans Brattskar.

Analysts saw Wickremesinghe was fanning the internecine feuds among the Tigers and systematically weakening them and a foreign policy intended to tighten the global dragnet against the LTTE. Agreements were signed with the US which allowed Sri Lanka to get assistance in terms of military training, military technology, intelligence, special training in counterterrorism and direct monetary assistance for military development. During the ceasefire period, the United States Pacific Command assessment team conducted a study from 12 September to 24 October 2002, which made several recommendations to strengthen the capabilities of the Sri Lanka Army, Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Air Force in case of the peace process failing. After studying the weakness of the military, the study recommended the use of cluster bombs (which unbanned until 2010 when the Cluster Munitions Convention came into effect) to destroy unarmoured area targets and recommended arming Kafirs and Mi-24 gunships with guided weapons in case of fighting close to enemy forces. The US also donated the SLNS Samudura during this time.

The opposition and nationalist movements of the country strongly opposed CFA and the overall peace process of Wickremesinghe&#x27;s regime. They continuously criticized and protested against the CFA claiming it as a threat to the sovereignty of the country which would ultimately lead the way to the formation of a separate state for the LTTE, or Tamil Eelam. It was later claimed by Karuna Amman who defected from the LTTE during Wickremesinghe&#x27;s regime that the LTTE dragged the peace talks to smuggle weapons and ammunition including aircraft.

The LTTE continuously violated the CFA on many occasions. In August 2007, the SLMM agreed that the LTTE had violated the CFA on a total of 3830 occasions while the government of Sri Lanka had violated CFA in only 351 occasions. Several Sri Lankan Army intelligence operatives were allegedly killed by the LTTE during this period.

=== Opposition (2004–2015) ===
A few days after LTTE proposed the Interim Self Governing Authority (ISGA), President Chandrika Kumaratunga sacked three ministers of the cabinet and took over the ministries using her constitutional powers, ending the uneasy coalition between her and Wickremesinghe while he was out of the country. Addressing the nation she claimed that this decision was taken in the interest of national security. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna also allied with the PA to defeat Wickremesinghe&#x27;s government, which they claimed to be a threat to the sovereignty of the country. President Chandrika Kumaratunga dissolved the parliament on 7 February 2004 which effectively ended Wickremesinghe&#x27;s government.

President Kumaratunga unexpectedly dissolved the Parliament on 7 February 2004 and called for new parliamentary elections. In the 2004 parliamentary elections held on 2 April Wickremesinghe&#x27;s UNF lost governmental office. Despite the expectation of a full six-year term, and planned projects cut short by the defeat, the UNP was optimistic that it could regain power in a future election. Within 14 months of UPFA&#x27;s victory, the radical JVP wing&#x27;s (composed of over 30 members) parting of ways with the government, left the UPFA&#x27;s parliamentary composition well short of the required majority. He remained in the post of the Opposition Leader until 2015, when Maithripala Sirisena who was sworn in as the President, appointed him as the Prime Minister.

==== 2005 presidential election ====
In December 2004, Wickremesinghe was chosen by the United National Party as its presidential candidate for the presidential elections due in late 2005. The Supreme Court decided in August 2005 that the elections should be held that year despite the president&#x27;s argument that her term would end in 2006. Mahinda Rajapaksa, then prime minister, was nominated as the presidential candidate of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. In the presidential election held on 17 November 2005, Wickremesinghe was narrowly defeated by Mahinda Rajapaksa, who won 50.29% of the vote to Wickremesinghe&#x27;s 48.43%. A large number of the minority Tamil population in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country, who were largely expected to vote for Wickremesinghe in the election, were prevented from voting by the LTTE which had enforced a boycott of the polls.

==== Dissent within the UNP ====
After the defeat in the 2004 parliamentary election, a senior member of UNP and a former minister of Wickremesinghe&#x27;s prime ministerial government, Rohitha Bogollagama, crossed over to the UPFA government. Soon after the UNP&#x27;s defeat in the 2005 presidential election, Mahinda Samarasinghe and Keheliya Rambukwella also defected to the government.

In 2007, Wickremesinghe established a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Mahinda Rajapaksa government agreeing to UNP&#x27;s collaboration with the government on issues of national interest. However, shortly afterwards, 17 of the UNP&#x27;s 60 members in parliament, including the group who had challenged Wickremesinghe&#x27;s leadership, led by deputy leader Karu Jayasuriya crossed over to the governing UPFA ranks in parliament and were given ministerial appointments. The group consisted of senior members of UNP and many of them were former ministers of Wickremesinghe&#x27;s 2001–2004 government: Karu Jayasuriya (Deputy Leader of UNP), M. H. Mohamed (former speaker of the parliament), Milinda Moragoda, G. L. Peiris, Bandula Gunawardane, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Gamini Lokuge, P. Dayaratna, Mano Wijeyeratne, Rajitha Senaratne, R.A.D. Sirisena, Mahinda Wijesekara, Naween Dissanayake, Hemakumara Nanayakkara, R. M. Dharmadasa Banda, Neomal Perera and Chandrasiri Sooriyaarachchi. The defection of the party stalwarts to join the government continued thereafter with several members such as; Susantha Punchinilame, Mahinda Ratnatilaka, Nandimithra Ekanayake, Thilanga Sumathipala, R. Duminda Silva, Ravindra Randeniya and Ashoka Wadigamangawa. However, in late 2008, Jayasuriya crossed over once again to the opposition and was given back the deputy leader post.

In February 2008, Wickremesinghe was under pressure to step down from the party leadership to accept an advisory position, from a majority of the UNP&#x27;s parliamentary group. In March, the UNP working committee decided to create a new post called Senior Leader of the party and appointed Wickremesinghe to the post. This was amid discussion with the UNP&#x27;s parliamentary group about the need for Wickremesinghe to relinquish his post (of party leader) so that a new leader could be appointed. However, in late March the party working committee decided that he should remain as the party leader.

Wickremesinghe was accused of being a dictator in UNP during his time as opposition leader. Udugama Sri Buddharakkitha Thero said that Wickremesinghe was acting like a dictator. In 2010, UNP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara accused that within the constitution of the UNP, Ranil Wickremesinghe is not a democratic leader but a dictator. Former minister and UNP MP Mahinda Wijesekara commented that &quot;We don&#x27;t need a dictator in the party,&quot; saying that Wickremesinghe opposed party reforms.

More than 60 UNP MPs allegedly left the party during Wickremesinghe&#x27;s leadership as opposition leader.

==== End of the civil war and 2010 presidential election ====
With the military defeat of the LTTE in the civil war, the government held a series of provincial elections in 2008 and 2009 for 8 provincial councils (Eastern, North Central, Sabaragamuwa, North Western, Central, Western, Uva, and Southern). On all occasions, the ruling UPFA soundly defeated the UNP in a landslide victory. Out of all the elections, the UNP obtained only 30% of the total vote and UPFA won 59% of the total polled. The UPFA won by a margin of 2,527,783, compared to 180,786 in the 2005 presidential election.

Wickremesinghe signed an Alliance Agreement with twelve other opposition parties in November 2009 and he announced that a common candidate would be fielded for the presidential election which would be held in 2010. Later, he announced that former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka had been selected as the common candidate and pledged to support him.

In August 2012, Minister of Health and SLFP general secretary Maithripala Sirisena alleged that during the 1994 presidential election campaign, all campaign details concerning the UNP presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake had been secretly passed on to his opponent, Chandrika Kumaratunga by Wickremesinghe. Sirisena made this disclosure while addressing an election committee meeting held at Siripura, Polonnaruwa. Sirisena asserted that he had ample proof to validate his claim and allegations. Consequently, both parties started to challenge each other for open media debates.

=== Third, fourth and fifth premierships (2015–2019) ===
The UNP along with several other parties and civil organizations signed an Understanding Agreement and decided to field the then Secretary-General of Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate for the 2015 presidential election. Sirisena pledged to appoint Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister if he won the election.

In the elections held on 8 January 2015, Maithripala Sirisena was elected as the 6th President of Sri Lanka, beating incumbent president Mahinda Rajapaksa in his bid for a third term. Sirisena appointed Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka during his inauguration on 9 January 2015.

Wickremesinghe&#x27;s UNP-led UNFGG won the 2015 parliamentary elections held on 17 August 2015, thus he was officially inaugurated as the Prime Minister for a fourth time, with 106 seats in the 225-member Parliament (though short of 7 seats to secure the simple majority of the Parliament) defeating the political rivalry UPFA leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his bid to return as prime minister after his defeat as president. Wickremesinghe also scored the highest preferential votes in the election with 500,556 votes, beating his rival Rajapaksa by a considerable margin whilst setting a new record as the candidate with the highest number of preferential votes in Sri Lankas&#x27; elections history.

Wickremesinghe vowed to regain the majority in the Parliament and make it as the United National Party&#x27;s Government, at the same time he also promised to secure the futures of younger generations and instantly confirmed that the Government will launch 1 million jobs for the youth as well advancement for the education and health sectors will maintain as promised. He also took steps to develop the former war-zones by touring the affected areas and met civil activists to discuss the issues faced by the Jaffna civilians and schools and to expedite investigations of missing persons. He also took steps to uplift Northern Province communities and to improve their standard of living.

Wickremesinghe also restarted the Megapolis plan which he started in when he was PM in 2001–2004. Surbana was consulted to revise the master plan to suit newer needs. The Ministry of Megapolis and Western development was created for project and the project which expects to convert the currently unplanned Western Province into a major megapolis by 2030 with an estimated population of 8.4 million and expects to solve the issues concerning traffic congestion, waste management and slum dwellers in urban areas. Wickremesinghe also showed interest in Surbana creating a similar plan for Trincomalee in the Eastern province and an agreement was later signed with Surbana for the purpose.

Wickremesinghe proposed major economic reforms and proposed a knowledge based social market economy which will be built on social justice principles that will also focus on the availability of global opportunities for education and strengthening of the health system to face health concerns of the 21st century. He also planned on reducing high income disparity levels in the domestic economy and increasing exports. He launched a plan to reform state-owned enterprise, enter into trade agreements with India and China to increase market access and regain GSP+ to regain EU markets, restructure key investment promotion agencies, develop tourism, attract high spending tourists, and develop the rural economy. Special economic zones and a special financial and business hub in Colombo were also proposed. Wickremesinghe also organized the Sri Lanka Economic Forum 2016 with the presence of international investor and Founder Chairman of Open Society George Soros and Nobel Laureate Economist Joseph Stiglitz and many other experts such as Ricardo Hausmann. The forum was seen as a boost to the Sri Lankan economy and during the forum Soros decided to invest in Sri Lanka the initial investments were expected to be around $300 Million. He also launched a loan and grant scheme for small and medium enterprises named &quot;Swa Shakthi&quot; empower rural entrepreneurs and develop the rural economy. However, in 2017, during his tenure Sri Lanka recorded just 3.1% economic growth rate, the lowest for 16 years.

During the Rajapaksa Administration which oversaw the rise of lawlessness and abuse of state power by Rajapaksa&#x27;s government ministers and officers after the defeat of the Administration, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe decided to set up the Financial Crimes Investigation Division. This led to arrest Basil Rajapaksa the younger brother of Mahinda Rajapaksa and his political henchmen who were involved in large-scale corruption also were arrested within months after forming the committee. However several family members and friends of Rajapaksa were questioned by the FCID, Rajapaksa fears that his entire family and friends could be prosecuted and brought down to justice. Former President Rajapaksa asked President Sirisena over the pending charges against his family members and political associations be dropped. However, President Sirisena refused to drop the charges that were ongoing, The meeting between President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa ended up unsuccessful over the President&#x27;s refusal to consider the key demands of Rajapaksa to be appointed as prime ministerial candidate and the charges against his family members and close associations to be dropped. Rajapaksa&#x27;s faction in SLFP criticised that the FCID was used as a tool to revenge on his associations and threatened to take legal action against FCID.

The United National Party led by Wickremesinghe suffered a landslide defeat in the 2018 local authority elections. His party was only able to secure 34 councils out of 340 total councils. Mahinda Rajapaksa’s proxy Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna won 231 councils. After the election defeat some MPs of UNP and party members asked Wickremesinghe to resign from the party leadership and prime minister position. Some media reported that President Maithripala Sirisena also urged Ranil Wickremesinghe Rajapaksa to resign from his position. On the evening of 26 October 2018, President Maithripala Sirisena appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister after the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance withdrew from the unity government. He also informed Wickremesinghe was removed from office. Wickremesinghe said he refused to accept the dismissal claiming that it was unconstitutional which triggered a constitutional crisis. Following rulings by the Supreme court and the Appeal court, Rajapaksa backed down and Wickremesinghe was re-instated at prime minister on 16 December 2018.

Following many internal party negotiations Wickremesinghe agreed to back Sajith Premadasa as the party candidate for the 2019 Sri Lankan presidential election. Premadasa was defeated by Gotabaya Rajapaksa who gained 52.25% of the votes against 41.99% by Premadasa.

==== Foreign policy ====

Wickremesinghe&#x27;s foreign policy in his third premiership was aimed at re-balancing relations with India and the West that were strained during the previous regime while sustaining good relations with China as well. He also chose to restart discussions to solve the Indo-Sri Lanka fishing dispute but strongly defended the Sri Lankan navy&#x27;s right to shoot Indian fishermen that fish in Sri Lankan waters, stating:

His foreign policy was seen as moving away from the Rajapaksa government&#x27;s isolationist policies, which distanced Sri Lanka from the Western world. His policies were seen to attract investments and financial aid.

His government allowed a 99-year lease of a port to a Chinese company which caused protests in 2017.

He also worked to develop relations with Japan and Singapore, choosing them as his second and third foreign state visits after being elected as prime minister. During his visit to Japan, he promised to support Japan&#x27;s bid to secure a seat on the United Nations Security Council and entered to a &quot;comprehensive partnership&quot; with Japan covering political, economic and security issues. During his visit to Singapore, in an interview with &quot;The Straits Times&quot; he invited Singaporean submarines and frigates to visit Sri Lanka.

==== Government bonds controversy ====
In February 2015 CBSL advertised the sale of Rs. 1 billion in 30 year government bonds at a coupon of 12.5%, though several accounts erroneously cite an indicative rate of 9.5%. The sale was oversubscribed with 36 bids totaling Rs. 20 billion. The majority of bidders, 26, bidded for Rs. 100 million or less at a rate of 9.5%–10.5%. However, a few bidders, including Perpetual Treasuries Limited, wanted interest rates of 11%–12%. On 27 February 2015 the CBSL accepted Rs. 10 billion in bids at rates of 9.5%–12.5%. The issuing of ten times the advertised bonds, and at a higher than expected rate, was alleged to cost the Sri Lankan government an additional Rs. 1.6 billion ($10.6 million), though this was disputed by the Leader of the House of Parliament. A petition was lodged in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka contesting the methodology used to allege such a loss. Perpetual Treasuries was issued, directly and indirectly, with Rs. 5 billion in bonds at 12.5%. Perpetual Treasuries was one of the primary dealers in the sale and is owned by son-in-law of the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Arjuna Mahendran, who was appointed by Wickremesinghe.

On 28 October 2016 the Committee On Public Enterprises, after a lengthy investigation, found Mahendran responsible for the bond issue scam and recommended legal action be taken against him. However, President Maithripala Sirisena announced that he had appointed a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry to further investigate the case. The commission handed over the report on Central Bank bond issuance to Sirisena on 30 December 2017, and the Presidential Secretariat made available the full report in PDF form from its website for public viewing. During the investigation Wickremesinghe had to appear before the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry. A group of ministers from the President&#x27;s party along with opposition MPs failed in a recent attempt to pass a motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister in Sri Lanka&#x27;s Parliament. On 15 March 2018 Colombo Fort Magistrate&#x27;s Court issued an arrest warrant on Arjuna Mahendra on charges of criminal breach of trust for allegedly providing confidential information of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to Perpetual Treasuries Limited.

=== Opposition (2019–2022) ===
Following his defeat, Premadasa left the party to form his own party, Samagi Jana Balawegaya from which he contested the 2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary election. Wickremesinghe led the remaining party members in the parliamentary election which was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 parliamentary elections resulted in a landslide victory of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna led by Mahinda Rajapaksa gaining 59.09% of the votes and securing 145 seats in parliament and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya gained 23.90% of votes and 54 seats. The United National Party suffering the worst defeat in its history received a total of 249,435 votes, which was 2.15% of votes cased. For the first time in its history, it failed to win a single seat in parliament, having only gained one national list seat. Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the national list member of parliament of the UNP on 23 June 2021.

Wickremesinghe actively continued to serve as vice chairman of the International Democrat Union and chairman of the Asia Pacific Democrat Union.

=== Fifth premiership (2022) ===
By May 2022, the country was in sovereign default and facing hyperinflation, leading to political and social unrest. With events leading to Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s resignation on 9 May 2022, due to the 2022 Sri Lankan protests, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed Wickremesinghe as prime minister on 12 May 2022. He was assured the support of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna members of parliament, while other parties refused to join his cabinet initially.

Reuters described Wickremesinghe as an &quot;economic liberal who has experience dealing with the International Monetary Fund&quot;. Wickremesinghe has stated that he intends to form a national government with the participation of all political parties in the parliament and lead the country through the worst economic crisis in its history with less than one million USD in foreign reserves and unable to import essential fuel, food, and medicines, calling the months to come the most difficult in the country&#x27;s history.

On 25 May, Wickremesinghe was appointed Minister of Finance, Economic Stability and National Policies.

On 9 July, the Prime Minister&#x27;s office announced that Wickremesinghe was ready to resign to make way for an all-party government as protesters stormed and burned his residence that day. Later in the evening, protesters broke into the 115 Fifth Lane, Wickremesinghe&#x27;s private residence in Colombo, and set it on fire.

== Presidency (2022–2024) ==


On 13 July, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives, with Wickremesinghe taking charge of the presidency in an acting capacity due to his premiership and imposing a state of emergency in Sri Lanka. Following Rajapaksa&#x27;s official resignation, Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the acting president of Sri Lanka before Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya on 15 July. Wickremesinghe, who had formerly been a National List MP with his party represented by only one seat in the Parliament, became the President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Minister of Technology, and Minister of Finance all at the same time. Upon becoming the acting president, Wickremesinghe prohibited the usage of &quot;His Excellency&quot; as an honorific prefix for the President and officially abolished the usage of a presidential flag.

On 20 July, he was elected as the 9th President of Sri Lanka by the Parliament of Sri Lanka in a secret ballot to serve the remainder of Rajapaksa&#x27;s term, which was supposed to end in November 2024. He defeated his main rival, Dullas Alahapperuma, with 134 votes to 82. On 21 July, he was sworn in as the ninth (eighth executive) President of Sri Lanka at the Parliament premises before Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya. A day later, he appointed Dinesh Gunawardena as prime minister.

In September 2022, Wickremesinghe visited the UK as the head of state to attend the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, at the invitation of King Charles III. 

=== Crackdown on anti-government protests ===
Soon after he was appointed as the president, Wickremesinghe vowed to crack down on the 2022 anti-government protests. Wickremesinghe denounced the protestors as &quot;fascists&quot;. Security forces raided the protest site in Galle Face Green in the early hours of 22 July, a day after Wickremesinghe was sworn in. 50 protestors were injured and two were hospitalised. BBC journalists were also attacked during the raid. Saliya Pieris, president of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, condemned the raid. British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Sarah Hulton, also expressed concerns.

=== Handling of economic crisis ===

Wickremesinghe continued the government policies for economic recovery initiated during the last few days of his predecessor&#x27;s term. His administration continued power rationing and introduced fuel rationing to control the country&#x27;s energy crisis, while increasing direct taxes with the aim of increasing government revenue to secure an IMF bailout package by late 2022. These tax increases were largely unpopular and triggered protests organized by the affected sectors. Sri Lanka saw a contraction of 11% of its economy in 2022, with inflation peaking at 54% in December 2022. Wickremesinghe was criticized for hosting celebrations of the 75th anniversary of Sri Lankan independence on 4 February 2023, while the country was amidst an economic crisis.

A significant milestone was achieved by the Wickremesinghe administration in early March 2023, when Wickremesinghe announced to parliament that the IMF has approved the first tranche of US$330 million of its bailout package for Sri Lanka. The IMF bailout was expected to open up additional support of over US$3.75 billion from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other lenders; paving the way for Sri Lanka to rework a substantial part of its $84bn worth of public debt. Under the IMF program, his administration initiated a number of economic reforms including enforcing cost reflective pricing for state owned Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), enacting the Central Bank (CB) Act of Sri Lanka to give freedom to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in its decision making, enacting several other key economic bills such as Economic Transformation Bill, and improving the relationship with Japan which soured under Gotabaya Rajapaksa over the cancellation of the LRT project. Furthermore, his administration was able to complete most of the debt restructuring process including local and international debt. 
=== 2023 local government elections ===
In August 2024, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgement which held that Wickremesinghe as the Minister of Finance, former Chairman and members of the Election Commission and the Attorney General, violated the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Sri Lankan Constitution of Dr Harini Amarasuriya, MP of the National People&#x27;s Power; Ranjith Madduma Bandara, General Secretary of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya; and the Centre for Policy Alternatives and People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL); by arbitrary and unlawful conduct which led to the 2023 local government elections not taking place at the time that they should have been held. In response, Wickremesinghe acknowledged the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling that citizens’ basic rights were violated by the postponement of the local government elections, however stated that he does not regret the decision, stating that he was &quot;dedicated to ensuring the people’s right to live and in maintaining their safety&quot; at the time.

=== 2024 presidential election ===
Since the start of 2024, there were many speculations whether Wickremesinghe would run for a term of his own right in the 2024 presidential election. By mid-2024, Wickremesinghe himself was hinting that he would run for re-election. As the election was called in August 2024, Wickremesinghe announced that he would run for re-election as an independent candidate. He was endorsed by the United National Party and a breakaway faction of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. He was also endorsed by the Ceylon Workers&#x27; Congress, Eelam People&#x27;s Democratic Party, and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna. This was Wickremesinghe&#x27;s third bid for the presidency, and his first time not running as a candidate of the UNP.

Wickremesinghe was eliminated at the end of the first phase of the vote counting, finishing in third place with only 17.27% of the vote. As no candidate secured a majority of the vote in the polls, the elections moved on to a second phase of preferential vote counting where only the two leading candidates remained in the competition. The eliminated candidates&#x27; second and third preferences were counted to elect the president between the top two candidates, Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa. As the second preferences count concluded, Anura Kumara Dissanayake was declared the 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka.

Wickremesinghe left the Presidential Secretariat on 23 September 2024, allowing for a peaceful transition of power to Dissanayake, who succeeded him as President.

== Post-presidency ==
Following the electoral defeat, UNP deputy leader Ruwan Wijewardena stated that Wickramasinghe won’t contest the upcoming parliamentary election. However, Wickramasinghe actively campaigned for the parties that supported him during the presidential elections, contesting under the New Democratic Front.

== Family and personal life ==
Wickremesinghe married Maithree Wickremesinghe, a Sri Lankan academic and Professor of English in 1994. Wickremesinghe has made several efforts to keep his private life out of politics. His personal life is rarely publicized or discussed. Maithree Wickremesinghe avoided the political spotlight until Wickremesinghe&#x27;s re-election as prime minister in 2015.

His paternal grandfather was Cyril Leonard Wickremesinghe, of the Ceylon Civil Service who was the first Sinhalese Land Commissioner and his grandmother was Esme Moonemalle Goonewardene, daughter of Proctor Edward Goonewardene and Ada Moonemalle of Moonemalle Walawwa, Kurunegala whose brother was Theodore Barcroft L. Moonemalle Proctor and Member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon.

His maternal grandfather was D. R. Wijewardena son of Muhandiram Tudugalage Don Philip Wijewardena and Helena Wijewardena née Dep Weerasinghe. His grandmother was Alice Ruby Meedeniya, daughter of J. H. Meedeniya Adigar of Meedeniya Walawwa, Ruwanwella and Corneliya Magdleine Senanayake whose mother was Corneliya Regina Senanayake née Obeyesekere, sister of Lambertus Obeyesekere Maha Mudaliyar of Kataluwa Walawwa.

A number of Wickremesinghe&#x27;s close relations were active in the government. His cousins Ruwan Wijewardene was the State Minister of Defence, Wasantha Senanayake was the State Minister of Foreign Affairs and his aunt Amari Wijewardene was the Sri Lanka High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.

<text>John Milton Chivington (January 27, 1821 – October 4, 1894) was a Methodist pastor and Mason who served as a colonel in the United States Volunteers during the New Mexico Campaign of the American Civil War. He led a rear action against a Confederate supply train in the Battle of Glorieta Pass that had the effect of ending the Confederacy&#x27;s campaigns in the Western states, and was then appointed a colonel of cavalry during the Colorado War.

Colonel Chivington gained infamy for leading the 700-man force of Colorado Territory volunteers responsible for one of the most heinous atrocities in American military history: the November 1864 Sand Creek massacre. An estimated 70 to 600 peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho – about two-thirds of whom were women, children, and infants – were murdered and mutilated by Col. Chivington and the volunteer troops under his command. Chivington and his men also took scalps and many other human body parts as trophies, including unborn fetuses, as well as male and female genitalia. The Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War conducted an investigation of the massacre, but while they condemned Chivington and his soldiers in the strongest possible terms, no court-martial proceedings were brought against him or them. The only punishment Col. Chivington suffered was public exposure and the end of his political aspirations.

Three years prior to Sand Creek, on August 2, 1861, he became the first Grand Master of Masons of Colorado. Several Freemasons, some of whom were present at the Sand Creek Massacre, objected to Chivington&#x27;s actions and publicly denounced them, while others supported him.

==Early life==
Chivington was born in Lebanon, Ohio on January 27, 1821, the son of Isaac and Jane Chivington, who had fought under General William Henry Harrison against members of Tecumseh&#x27;s Confederacy at the Battle of the Thames.

Drawn to Methodism, Chivington became a minister. Following ordination in 1844, his first appointment was to Payson Circuit in the Illinois Conference. On the journey from Ohio to Illinois, Chivington contracted smallpox. He served the Illinois conference for ten years. In 1853, he worked in a Methodist missionary expedition to the Wyandot people in Kansas, a part of the Kansas–Nebraska Annual Conference. His outspoken views in favor of abolitionism put him in danger, and upon the advice of &quot;Congressman Craig and other friends,&quot; Chivington was persuaded to leave the Kansas Territory for the Nebraska Territory.

As a result, the Methodist Church transferred Chivington to a parish in Omaha, Nebraska. Chivington left this position after a year. Historian James Haynes said of Chivington&#x27;s pastoral abilities: &quot;Mr. Chivington was not as steady in his demeanor as becomes a man called of God to the work of the ministry, giving his ministerial friends regret and even trouble in their efforts to sustain his reputation.&quot;

In May 1860, Chivington moved, with his family, to the Colorado Territory and settled in Denver. From there, he sought to establish missions in the South Park mining camps in Park County. He was elected Presiding Elder of the new Rocky Mountain District and served in that capacity until 1862. Controversy began to mar Chivington&#x27;s appointment, who stopped performing his function as presiding elder. Chivington was not reappointed at the 1862 conference; rather, his name was recorded as &quot;located.&quot; According to early Methodist polity, describing a minister as &quot;located&quot; means that the minister has effectively been retired. Historian of Methodism Isaac Beardsley, a personal friend of Chivington, suggested that Chivington was &quot;thrown out&quot; because of his involvement with the armed forces. Chivington&#x27;s status as being &quot;located&quot; did not remove him completely from Methodist politics. His name appears as a member of the executive board of Colorado Seminary, the historic precursor of the University of Denver and the Iliff School of Theology. His name also appears in the incorporation document issued by the Council and House of Representatives of the Colorado Territory, which was approved by then governor John Evans.

==Battle of Glorieta Pass==
When the Civil War broke out, Colorado Territorial Governor William Gilpin offered him a commission as a chaplain, but Chivington refused it, saying he wanted to fight. He was commissioned a major in the 1st Colorado Infantry Regiment under Colonel John P. Slough.

During Confederate General Henry Hopkins Sibley&#x27;s offensive in the East Arizona and New Mexico territories, Chivington led a 418-man detachment to Apache Canyon. On March 26, 1862, they surprised about 300 Confederate Texans under Major Charles L. Pyron. The startled Texans were routed with four killed, 20 wounded and 75 captured, while Chivington&#x27;s men lost five killed and 14 wounded. This small victory raised morale in Slough&#x27;s army. On March 28, Slough sent Chivington and his men on a circling movement, with orders to hit Sibley in the flank once Slough&#x27;s main force had engaged his front at Glorieta Pass, New Mexico. Chivington got into position above the Pass, but waited in vain for either Slough or Sibley to arrive. While they waited, scouts reported that Sibley&#x27;s entire supply train was nearby at Johnson&#x27;s Ranch.

Chivington&#x27;s command, among whom there was a detail of Colorado Mounted Rangers, descended the slope and crept up on the supply train. They waited for an hour in concealment, then attacked, driving off or capturing the small Confederate guard detail without any casualties. Chivington ordered the supply wagons burned, and the horses and mules slaughtered. Meanwhile, the Battle of Glorieta Pass was raging at Pigeon&#x27;s Ranch. Chivington returned to Slough&#x27;s main force to find it rapidly falling back. The Confederates had won the battle, but because of Chivington&#x27;s forces, they had no supplies to sustain their advance and were forced to retreat, rendering their victory moot. Sibley&#x27;s men reluctantly retreated back to Texas and never again threatened New Mexico.

Chivington earned high praise for his decisive stroke at Johnson&#x27;s Ranch, even though his discovery of the Confederate supply train was accidental. Critics have suggested that had Chivington returned quickly to reinforce Slough&#x27;s army when he heard gunfire, his 400 extra men might have allowed the Union to win the battle. A captured Confederate chaplain also complained that Chivington had threatened to kill the prisoners he took at Johnson&#x27;s Ranch.

==Colorado District command==

The victory at Glorieta Pass gave Chivington a reputation as a bold and daring commander. Along with his ardent advocacy of statehood, he hoped it could help him become the first member of the U.S. House of Representatives elected from Colorado. To that end he cultivated his connections with political leaders like territorial governor John Evans. But he also knew that his chances would be best if he could secure another key military victory. The wars with various local Indian tribes, a matter that affected Coloradans more directly than the Civil War, offered an opportunity.

In April 1862, Chivington was appointed colonel of the 1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment, and commander of the military district of Colorado. In November, Chivington was appointed brigadier general of volunteers, an appointment withdrawn in February 1863. His superiors expressed enough concern that he was putting his political interests ahead of his duties that he had to write Major General Samuel Ryan Curtis, commander of the Department of Kansas, a letter of reassurance.

==Sand Creek Massacre==

Following the Hungate massacre in June 1864, tensions between settlers and Indians rose. War seemed likely, and Evans wrote to the War Department in Washington to request both more troops and the authority to raise more for a hundred days. The latter was granted, and Chivington formed the 3rd Colorado Cavalry Regiment from a group of volunteers who largely lacked combat experience, to protect Denver and the Platte road. For political reasons, Evans had stoked the fears of the populace regarding Indian attacks, and he and Chivington both hoped successful military engagements against the Indians would further their careers. But most of the Indian war parties and attacks were occurring hundreds of miles away.

In the fall of 1864, Major Edward Wynkoop received a letter from Black Kettle requesting a peace council and an exchange of prisoners, and Wynkoop succeeded in holding a conference with multiple Cheyenne and Arapaho chiefs, including Black Kettle and Left Hand, and securing the release of some prisoners who had been taken during earlier Dog Soldier raids. Wynkoop and Captain Silas Soule, after the peace conference, traveled to Denver with both the returned prisoners and some of the chiefs. Wynkoop convinced a reluctant Evans, along with Chivington, to meet with the chiefs. Known as the Camp Weld Conference, it resulted in Evans making an offer of protection to those Indians who would surrender to Wynkoop at Fort Lyon. The chiefs agreed, and, after gathering their peaceful tribes, camped about north of the fort, at Big Sandy Creek.

In October 1864, the 100-day enlistment of the 3rd was almost over, and Chivington&#x27;s Civil War enlistment had expired, meaning he would soon lose his command position after the 3rd was disbanded. Tensions had eased even before the Camp Weld conference, meaning the battle Chivington had hoped for less likely. After learning of the agreement reached with the chiefs, Chivington complained to Curtis that Wynkoop, whom he resented for having dealt with the Indians without clearing most of those actions with him, was too conciliatory with the Indians. Curtis replaced him with Major Scott Anthony, who agreed with Chivington&#x27;s goal of Indian eradication. But Anthony requested that Wynkoop stay and advise him for a short period, despite being under orders from Curtis to end the protection of the Arapaho and Cheyenne encamped near Fort Lyon, and end the promised distribution of provisions.

After resettling his mostly Southern Cheyenne people, and hearing from Major Anthony that the distribution of provisions was ended, Black Kettle sent most of his warriors to hunt, leaving only 60 men in the village, most of them too old or too young to hunt. Dog soldiers and other Indian warriors were not part of the Sand Creek encampment.

In November, Chivington and his 800 troops of the 1st and 3rd Colorado cavalry regiments along with a company of 1st New Mexico Volunteer Infantry marched to Fort Lyon. On the way there, they learned from those going the other way how many Arapaho and Cheyenne were camped near the fort, that the Indians had not left and stated their peaceful intentions. Upon reaching the fort, with Wynkoop and Anthony still present, Chivington posted guards outside so no one could leave or enter and placed soldiers known to have helped the Indians under arrest.

Chivington then briefed the other troops on his plans to march on the Indians the next morning and slaughter as many of them as possible. Some junior officers demurred. &quot;Any man that would take part in the murders, knowing the circumstances as we do&quot;, said Captain Silas Soule, &quot;is a low-lived cowardly son of a bitch.&quot; Lt. Joe Cramer also said that with the Indians currently showing no signs of preparing for war, Chivington&#x27;s plans amounted to mass murder. Chivington threatened to hang Soule for attempting to incite mutiny and told the others who had challenged his orders that they should leave the Army.

Afterwards the troops marched nearly to the reservation. On the night of November 28, after camping, Chivington&#x27;s men drank heavily and celebrated the anticipated fight. The next morning Chivington ordered his troops to attack.

Soule, who had come along, refused to follow Chivington&#x27;s order and told his men to hold fire. Other soldiers in Chivington&#x27;s force, however, immediately attacked the village. Ignoring the U.S. flag, and a white flag they raised shortly after the soldiers began firing, Chivington&#x27;s soldiers massacred the majority of the mostly unarmed Cheyenne, taking scalps and other body parts as battle trophies, including human fetuses and male and female genitalia. The attack became known as the Sand Creek Massacre. 

The Colorado forces lost 15 killed and more than 50 wounded, mostly due to friendly fire (likely caused by their heavy drinking). Between 150 and 200 Indians were estimated dead, nearly all women and children. Chivington testified before a Congressional committee that his forces had killed 500 to 600 Indians and that few of them were women or children. Others testified against him.

A prominent mixed-race Cheyenne witness named Edmund Guerrier, said that about 53 men and 110 women and children were killed.

With Chivington&#x27;s declaring his forces had won a battle against hostile Cheyenne, the action was initially celebrated as a victory. On the way back from the site, he wrote an official account of a long march through snow to a battle against fierce and dedicated opposition won by troops who performed &quot;nobly&quot;. Some soldiers displayed Indian body parts as trophies in Denver saloons. However, the testimony of Soule, Cramer and his men contradicted their commander and resulted in a U.S. Congressional investigation into the incident, which concluded that Chivington had acted wrongly.

Soule and some of the men whom he commanded testified against Chivington at his U.S. Army court martial. Chivington denounced Soule as a liar. Within three months, Soule was murdered by a soldier who had been under Chivington&#x27;s command at Sand Creek. Some believed Chivington may have been involved.

Chivington was soon condemned for his part in the massacre, but he had already resigned from the Army in June or July of 1865 . The general post-Civil War amnesty meant that criminal charges could not be filed against him. An Army judge publicly stated that the Sand Creek massacre was &quot;a cowardly and cold-blooded slaughter, sufficient to cover its perpetrators with indelible infamy, and the face of every American with shame and indignation&quot;. Public outrage at the brutality of the massacre, particularly considering the mutilation of corpses, was intense. Even those who favored harsher action towards the Indians condemned Chivington as they knew it had cost them any trust the Indians might have had in them. It was believed to have contributed to public pressure to change Indian policy. The Congress later rejected the idea of a general war against the Indians of the Middle West.

The panel of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War declared:
As to Colonel Chivington, your committee can hardly find fitting terms to describe his conduct. Wearing the uniform of the United States, which should be the emblem of justice and humanity; holding the important position of commander of a military district, and therefore having the honor of the government to that extent in his keeping, he deliberately planned and executed a foul and dastardly massacre which would have disgraced the verist [sic] savage among those who were the victims of his cruelty. Having full knowledge of their friendly character, having himself been instrumental to some extent in placing them in their position of fancied security, he took advantage of their in-apprehension and defenceless [sic] condition to gratify the worst passions that ever cursed the heart of man. Whatever influence this may have had upon Colonel Chivington, the truth is that he surprised and murdered, in cold blood, the unsuspecting men, women, and children on Sand creek, who had every reason to believe they were under the protection of the United States authorities.

==Later life and death==

Chivington resigned from the army in February 1865. In 1865 his son, Thomas, drowned and Chivington returned to Nebraska to administer the estate. There he became an unsuccessful freight hauler. He seduced and then married his daughter-in-law, Sarah. In October 1871, she obtained a decree of divorce for non-support.

Public outrage forced Chivington to withdraw from politics and kept him out of Colorado&#x27;s campaign for statehood. The editor of the &quot;Omaha Daily Herald&quot; tagged Chivington a &quot;rotten, clerical hypocrite.&quot;

In July 1868, Chivington went to Washington, D.C. in an unsuccessful pursuit of a $37,000 (~$ in ) claim for Indian depredations. He returned to Omaha, but journeyed to Troy, New York, during 1869 to stay with Sarah&#x27;s relatives. He borrowed money from them but did not repay. Sarah recalled that they returned to Washington in the spring of 1870 and Chivington &quot;spent his time trying to get money without labor. ...

The early spring of 1871 he skipped as I heard afterward to Canada ... Left me without means of support. I had no desire to live with a criminal. 

After living briefly in California, Chivington returned to Ohio to farm. Later he became editor of a local newspaper. In 1883, he campaigned for a seat in the Ohio legislature, but withdrew when his opponents drew attention to the Sand Creek Massacre.

He returned to Denver where he worked as a deputy sheriff until shortly before his death from cancer in 1894. His funeral took place at the city&#x27;s Trinity United Methodist Church before his remains were interred at Fairmount Cemetery.

To the end of his life, Chivington maintained that Sand Creek had been a successful operation. He argued that his expedition was a response to Cheyenne and Arapaho raids and torture inflicted on wagon trains and white settlements in Colorado.

Chivington violated official agreements for protection of Black Kettle&#x27;s friendly band. He also overlooked how the massacre caused the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Sioux to strengthen their alliance and to accelerate their raids on white settlers. Until he died, Chivington still claimed to have been justified in ordering the attack, consistently stating, &quot;I stand by Sand Creek.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1887, the unincorporated settlement of Chivington, Colorado, was established and named after John Chivington. The railroad town on the Missouri Pacific Railroad line was fairly close to the site of the massacre. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was largely depopulated by the Dust Bowl, but some buildings still remain.

Because of Chivington&#x27;s position as a lay preacher, in 1996 the General conference of the United Methodist Church expressed regret for the Sand Creek massacre. It issued an apology to the Southern Cheyenne for the &quot;actions of a prominent Methodist&quot;.

In 2005, the City Council of Longmont, Colorado, agreed to change the name of Chivington Drive in the town following a two-decade campaign. Protesters had objected to Chivington being honored for the Sand Creek Massacre. The street was renamed Sunrise Drive.

==In popular culture==
*In George Sherman&#x27;s 1951 Western &quot;Tomahawk&quot;, set several years after the Sand Creek massacre, Army Lt. Rob Dancy brags to Julie Madden, whose wagon his patrol is escorting, about having ridden with Chivington years before. The movie&#x27;s main character, frontiersman Jim Bridger, later tells Julie that his wife had been chief Black Kettle&#x27;s daughter and that the teenage Cheyenne girl accompanying him, Monahseetah, is her sister and the only survivor of a massacre perpetrated by Chivington and his men. Bridger suspects Dancy to be his wife&#x27;s murderer and pursues him after Dancy escapes from a battle with the Sioux he had provoked against orders. When confronted, Dancy confirms Bridger&#x27;s suspicion by claiming to have acted on orders. While Bridger is still beating him up, Dancy is shot by a young Sioux whose friend Dancy had killed (thus initiating the conflict) early in the story.
*The American television series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; broadcast &quot;Massacre at Sand Creek&quot; on December 27, 1956. It recounted the massacre and the court-martial of Chivington, but changed the names of those involved. Chivington became John Templeton, played by Everett Sloane.
*Ainslie Pryor had an uncredited role as Chivington in the 1957 film, &quot;The Guns of Fort Petticoat&quot;, with Audie Murphy as Lt. Frank Hewitt, Hope Emerson as Hannah Lacey, Jeanette Nolan as Cora Melavan, and Sean McClory as Emmett Kettle.
*The episode &quot;Handful of Fire&quot; (December 5, 1961) of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Laramie&quot; western series is loosely based on historical events. A Colonel John Barrington, played by George Macready, and presumably modeled on John Chivington, escapes while facing a court martial at Fort Laramie for his role in the Wounded Knee Massacre in South Dakota in 1890. The &quot;Laramie&quot; episode reveals that series character Slim Sherman (John Smith) had been present at Wounded Knee and hence testified against Barrington. Then Barrington&#x27;s daughter, Madge, played by Karen Sharpe, takes Slim hostage. She has papers which she contends justify her father&#x27;s harsh policies against the Indians. Slim escapes but is trapped by the Sioux and must negotiate with the Indians to save the party from massacre.
*Lewis B. Patten wrote several historical novels about the Cheyenne. In the first story in &quot;Gun The Man Down, a Western Duo&quot;, The White Cheyenne is the story of Julien Tremeau, son of mountain man and rancher Charles Tremeau and his Indian wife Red Earth Woman. Charles Tremeau thought his son should know the white world as well as the Indian, and so sent Julien East to school, only for Julien to return to the West, marry Bird Woman, and live with the Cheyenne in Chief Black Kettle&#x27;s village. The morning Colonel Chivington and his volunteer army encircled the village and began the slaughter that would result in more than two hundred dead, Bird Woman was killed, their two children taken prisoner to be put on exhibit in a tent show in Denver, and Julien left for dead. But he was not dead and he vowed vengeance on all whites, including the man who had stolen his children.

<text>Your Arsenal is the third studio album by English singer Morrissey, released on 27 July 1992 by record label His Master&#x27;s Voice.

The album received critical acclaim and reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart.

== Content ==

Morrissey had been rehearsing with a new band prior to the release of &quot;Your Arsenal&quot;, which was the first official album of this new line-up.

Commencing with &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Need Someone on Your Side&quot;, the album represents a clear change in direction for Morrissey from indie pop to a more muscular rock sound; with some elements of rockabilly. It also contains a glam rock influence, due to the involvement of ex-David Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson. Songs such as &quot;Certain People I Know&quot;, &quot;Glamorous Glue&quot; and &quot;I Know It&#x27;s Gonna Happen Someday&quot;, which are respectively influenced by T. Rex, and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; period songs (e.g. &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; and the last by &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot;). Bowie himself later covered the track &quot;I Know It&#x27;s Gonna Happen Someday&quot; on his 1993 album &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;.

== Release ==

&quot;Your Arsenal&quot; was released on 27 July 1992 by record label His Master&#x27;s Voice. It reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart.

The album earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Album.

In 2014, Rhino Records issued a &quot;Definitive Master&quot; of the album. This version was remastered and substitutes the original album version of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; for the U.S. single mix. It also includes a bonus DVD of a 1991 concert from Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.

==Critical reception ==
&quot;Your Arsenal&quot; was praised by critics. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it his &quot;most consistent solo set to date&quot;. Bill Wyman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that guitarist Alain Whyte &quot;provides the very melodic, sometimes rockabilly-inflected settings Morrissey demands, and frequently they end up triumphant.&quot;

Referring to the album as &quot;a dynamic, invigorating fusion of glam rock and rockabilly&quot; and noting that it &quot;rocks harder than any other record Morrissey ever made&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic cited &quot;Your Arsenal&quot; as Morrissey&#x27;s &quot;finest solo record and his best work since &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Your Arsenal&quot; was listed as one of the top 50 albums of 1992 by &quot;Q&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="394975" wikidata="Q572660" url="?curid=394975" title="Hassan Abshir Farah">
<text>Hassan Abshir Farah (, ; June 20, 1945 – July 12, 2020) was a Somali politician. He previously served as mayor of Mogadishu and interior minister of Puntland. From November 12, 2001 to November 8, 2003, he was also prime minister of Somalia. Farah was an MP in the Federal Parliament of Somalia.

==Biography==
Farah was born in 1945 in the former Italian Somaliland. He hailed from Majeerteen subclan of Darod. Between 1961 and 1965, he attended secondary school in Mogadishu, the nation&#x27;s capital. He spent the next two years at the Egyptian Military Academy in Cairo, Egypt. Between 1980 and 1986, Hassan also studied at the Somali National University, where he obtained a degree in Law.

==Political career==

===Mayor of Mogadishu===
Farah&#x27;s political career began in 1969, when he was a junior member of the military junta that took control of Somalia in 1969 under Siad Barre. His first official role was working as vice district commissioner of Mogadishu. In the 1970s, Hassan was appointed mayor of Mogadishu. During this period, he worked with the National Security Service to have many opponents to the government arrested. He also served as governor of Shabeellaha Dhexe and Bakool, and as the Somali ambassador to Japan and Germany. While governor, he opposed the rising force of the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), which resisted Siad Barre&#x27;s rule.

===Interior Minister of Puntland===
In December 1999, acting as the Interior Minister of the autonomous northeastern Puntland region and serving under then-President of Puntland, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, Farah ordered the eviction of three NGO workers, citing &quot;unsatisfactory services&quot; as reasons for their dismissal: Eddie Johns of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Remmelt Hummeyn of UNDP and Said Al-Naimari of UNICEF.

===Prime Minister of the Transitional National Government (TNG)===
Farah was prime minister in the Transitional National Government (TNG) of Somalia from November 12, 2001 until December 8, 2003, when then President Abdiqassim Salad Hassan held a session of parliament, which cast a vote of no confidence with regard to the Prime Minister and the Parliamentary Speaker at the time, Abdallah Derow Isaak.

During Farah&#x27;s first month in office, which was a few months after the September 11 attacks in 2001, he said the United States would be welcome to deploy troops to Somalia for the first time since the withdrawal of US forces from the UN missions of the 1990s, and to help monitor terrorist activities in the country. He was referring to Al-Itihaad Al-Islamiya (AIAI), which the US did name as a terrorist organization. On December 15, 2001, he stated there were no members of Al-Qaeda in Somalia, though a rival warlord claimed there were 50 armed fighters of the terrorist organization who had entered the country. In any event, the United States did not deploy any troops to Somalia at the time.

He was the primary representative of the TNG at the October 2002 Somali Reconciliation Conference held in Eldoret, Kenya. However, those efforts failed to produce a lasting settlement, since the TNG was heavily contested by the rival Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC). The Somali National Reconciliation Conference meetings of July 2003 finally settled problems between the TNG and the SRRC, but by then the TNG had lost most of its momentum and funding. The three-year mandate for the TNG officially ended in August 2003, but the organization continued to carry on between the formal date and the creation of the successor TNG of 2004. President Abdiqassim Salad removed the Prime Minister and the Parliamentary Speaker in August 2003; the no-confidence vote of the Parliament in December 2003 was undertaken to formalize the decision. Writing from Nairobi, Hassan Abshir and Abdallah Derow Isaak both said any attempts to extend the terms of the TNG were &quot;unconstitutional.&quot;

===Transitional Federal Government (TFG)===
In 2004, Hassan Abshir Farah became the Fisheries Minister of the new Transitional Federal Government (TFG), which replaced the TNG. He was mostly active in the National Peace Process in the country. In late 2006, he secured a $55 million pirate-fighting contract with New York-based Top Cat Marine Security.

On August 1, 2006, Farah resigned along with seven other ministers, in protest at Prime Minister Ali Mohammed Ghedi&#x27;s postponement of talks with the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). He said &quot;We had no option but to resign because we believe if the talks are postponed again it will affect the reconciliation efforts&quot;.

===Puntland presidential elections===

In 2008, Farah launched a campaign to run for the president of Puntland an autonomous state in the Horn of Africa 2009 elections. Abdirahman Mohamud Farole was eventually elected to office in 8 January 2009 as he defeating incumbent president Mohamud Muse Hersi second round and then third third General Abdullahi Ahmed Jama.

===Federal Parliament===
Following the establishment of the Federal Government of Somalia in August 2012, Farah began serving as a legislator in the new Federal Parliament.

===Death===
Farah died from COVID-19 in Turkey in 2020.

<doc id="394976" wikidata="Q268586" url="?curid=394976" title="Culture shock">
<text>Culture shock is an experience a person may have when one moves to a cultural environment which is different from one&#x27;s own; it is also the personal disorientation a person may feel when experiencing an unfamiliar way of life due to immigration or a visit to a new country, a move between social environments, or simply transition to another type of life. One of the most common causes of culture shock involves individuals in a foreign environment. Culture shock can be described as consisting of at least one of four distinct phases: honeymoon, negotiation, adjustment, and adaptation.

Common problems include: information overload, language barrier, generation gap, technology gap, skill interdependence, formulation dependency, homesickness (cultural), boredom (job dependency), ethnicity, race, skin color, response ability (cultural skill set). There is no true way to entirely prevent culture shock, as individuals in any society are personally affected by cultural contrasts differently.

Culture shock is experienced by students who participate in study abroad programs. Research considering the study abroad experiences states that in-country support for students may assist them in overcoming the challenges and phases of culture shock. As stated in a study by Young et al., the distress experienced by culture shock has long-lasting effects therefore, universities with well-rounded programs that support students throughout the study abroad program, including preparation and post-program assistance, can alleviate challenges posed by culture shock, allow for global development and assist with the transition back into the home culture.

==Oberg&#x27;s four phases model==
Kalervo Oberg first proposed his model of cultural adjustment in a talk to the Women&#x27;s Club of Rio de Janeiro in 1954.

=== Honeymoon ===
During this period, the differences between the old and new culture are seen in a romantic light. For example, in moving to a new country, an individual might love the new food, the pace of life, and the locals&#x27; habits. During the first few weeks, most people are fascinated by the new culture. They associate with nationals who speak their language, and who are polite to the foreigners. Like most honeymoon periods, this stage eventually ends.

===Negotiation===
After some time (usually around three months, depending on the individual), differences between the old and new culture become apparent and may create anxiety. Excitement may eventually give way to unpleasant feelings of frustration and anger as one continues to experience unfavorable events that may be perceived as strange and offensive to one&#x27;s cultural attitude. Language barriers, stark differences in public hygiene, traffic safety, food accessibility and quality may heighten the sense of disconnection from the surroundings.

While being transferred into a different environment puts special pressure on communication skills, there are practical difficulties to overcome, such as circadian rhythm disruption that often leads to insomnia and daylight drowsiness; adaptation of gut flora to different bacteria levels and concentrations in food and water; difficulty in seeking treatment for illness, as medicines may have different names from the native country&#x27;s and the same active ingredients might be hard to recognize.

Still, the most important change in the period is communication: People adjusting to a new culture often feel lonely and homesick because they are not yet used to the new environment and meet people with whom they are not familiar every day. The language barrier may become a major obstacle in creating new relationships: special attention must be paid to one&#x27;s and others&#x27; culture-specific body language signs, linguistic faux pas, conversation tone, linguistic nuances and customs, and false friends. Such cultural adjustments may also cause a sense of identity confusion as individuals try to balance their original cultural identity with the pressures of assimilating into a new one. Having to preserve one&#x27;s identity while adhering to new standards may be psychologically taxing, which can result in emotional tiredness or even despair.

In the case of students studying abroad, some develop additional symptoms of loneliness that ultimately affect their lifestyles as a whole. Due to the strain of living in a different country without parental support, international students often feel anxious and feel more pressure while adjusting to new cultures—even more so when the cultural distances are wide, as patterns of logic and speech are different and a special emphasis is put on rhetoric.

=== Adjustment ===
Again, after some time (usually 6 to 12 months), one grows accustomed to the new culture and develops routines. One knows what to expect in most situations and the host country no longer feels all that new. One becomes concerned with basic living again, and things become more &quot;normal&quot;. One starts to develop problem-solving skills for dealing with the culture and begins to accept the culture&#x27;s ways with a positive attitude. The culture begins to make sense, and negative reactions and responses to the culture are reduced.

===Adaptation===
In the mastery stage individuals are able to participate fully and comfortably in the host culture. Mastery does not mean total conversion; people often keep many traits from their earlier culture, such as accents and languages. It is often referred to as the bicultural stage.

==Development==

Gary R. Weaver wrote that culture shock has &quot;three basic causal explanations&quot;: loss of familiar cues, the breakdown of interpersonal communications, and an identity crisis. Peter S. Adler emphasized the psychological causes. Tema Milstein wrote that it can have positive effects.

==Reverse culture shock==
Reverse culture shock (also known as &quot;re-entry shock&quot; or &quot;own culture shock&quot;) may take place—returning to one&#x27;s home culture after growing accustomed to a new one can produce the same effects as described above. These are results from the psychosomatic and psychological consequences of the readjustment process to the primary culture. The affected person often finds this more surprising and difficult to deal with than the original culture shock. This phenomenon, the reactions that members of the re-entered culture exhibit toward the re-entrant, and the inevitability of the two are encapsulated in the following saying, also the title of a book by Thomas Wolfe: &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;.

Reverse culture shock is generally made up of two parts: idealization and expectations. When an extended period of time is spent abroad we focus on the good from our past, cut out the bad, and create an idealized version of the past. Secondly, once removed from our familiar setting and placed in a foreign one we incorrectly assume that our previous world has not changed. We expect things to remain exactly the same as when we left them. The realization that life back home is now different, that the world has continued without us, and the process of readjusting to these new conditions as well as actualizing our new perceptions about the world with our old way of living causes discomfort and psychological anguish.

==Outcomes==
There are three basic outcomes of the adjustment phase:
* Some people find it impossible to accept the foreign culture and to integrate. They isolate themselves from the host country&#x27;s environment, which they come to perceive as hostile, withdraw into an (often mental) &quot;ghetto&quot; and see return to their own culture as the only way out. This group is sometimes known as &quot;Rejectors&quot; and describes approximately 60% of expatriates. These &quot;Rejectors&quot; also have the greatest problems re-integrating back home after return.
* Some people integrate fully and take on all parts of the host culture while losing their original identity. This is called cultural assimilation. They normally remain in the host country forever. This group is sometimes known as &quot;Adopters&quot; and describes approximately 10% of immigrants.
* Some people manage to adapt to the aspects of the host culture they see as positive, while keeping some of their own and creating their unique blend. They have no major problems returning home or relocating elsewhere. This group can be thought to be cosmopolitan. Approximately 30% of immigrants belong to this group.

Culture shock has many different effects, time spans, and degrees of severity. Many people are hampered by its presence and do not recognize why they are bothered.

There is evidence to suggest that the psychological influence of culture shock might also have physiological implications. For example, the psycho-social stress experienced during these circumstances is correlated with an early onset of puberty.

==Transition shock==

Culture shock is a subcategory of a more universal construct called transition shock. Transition shock is a state of loss and disorientation predicated by a change in one&#x27;s familiar environment that requires adjustment. There are many symptoms of transition shock, including:
* Anger
* Boredom
* Compulsive eating/drinking/weight gain
* Desire for home and old friends
* Excessive concern over cleanliness 
* Excessive sleep or trouble falling asleep
* Feelings of helplessness and withdrawal
* Getting &quot;stuck&quot; on one thing
* Glazed stare
* Homesickness
* Hostility towards host nationals
* Impulsivity
* Irritability
* Mood swings
* Physiological stress reactions
* Stereotyping host nationals
* Suicidal or fatalistic thoughts
* Withdrawal

<doc id="394977" wikidata="Q707504" url="?curid=394977" title="Brendan O'Brien (record producer)">
<text>Brendan O&#x27;Brien (born June 30, 1960) is an American record producer, mixer, and engineer. He has worked with many groups and artists during his career, such as AC/DC, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bob Dylan, Rage Against the Machine, and Bruce Springsteen. O&#x27;Brien was also credited on a plethora of nu metal albums with such artists as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Incubus, and Papa Roach

== Career ==
Raised in Atlanta, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s career blossomed as a young guitarist with a local band by the name of Pranks, signed by what was then Century Artists Management. The management company had what many considered the best of Atlanta and the surrounding region in those days, including the likes of Mother&#x27;s Finest, Ezra Pound and a dozen other &quot;super-regional&quot; acts. In the late 1970s, he moved on to writing, performing, and recording with the band Samurai Catfish.

O&#x27;Brien became a successful local engineer, considered to be the go-to guy to &quot;make a record in a few days for $1500&quot;. His studio career was propelled by the success of the first Black Crowes album, &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;, which he engineered and for which he also performed guitar, bass, and &quot;a potpourri of instruments&quot;. The following year he produced and mixed Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; debut album &quot;Core&quot; and engineered and mixed Red Hot Chili Peppers breakthrough album &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;. These two records launched his career as an in-demand, multi-platinum producer, engineer and mixer. He produced and mixed nearly the entire catalog of Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam. Most of his productions were engineered by Nick DiDia, whom he worked with throughout most of his career.

O&#x27;Brien often engineered and recorded his own sessions with the help of various assistant engineers. A majority of the records that he produced and/or mixed were made at Southern Tracks Recording Studio near his home, in Atlanta, from the late 1980s until its closure.

In the mid-1990s, O&#x27;Brien became vice president of Epic Records and the Epic imprint 57 Records. He also played a Hammond organ for Bob Dylan&#x27;s appearance on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. In 1995, he joined Pearl Jam and Neil Young on keyboards for the &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; tour across Europe.

In 2002, he won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album for his work on Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;The Rising&quot;. In 2009, he was awarded the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. In 2015, he produced &quot;Higher Truth&quot;, the final release by Chris Cornell.

He produced the Italian bluesman artist Zucchero Fornaciari&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Black Cat&quot; and received production credits for track three of the 2017 EP &quot;Cold Dark Place&quot; by the progressive metal band Mastodon.

<text>Nikolay Timofeyevich Tanayev (; 5 November 1945 – 19 July 2020) was a Kyrgyz politician, who served as the Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan from 2002 to 2005, under President Askar Akayev.

==Career==
He served as Deputy Prime Minister under Kurmanbek Bakiyev and was made acting PM on 22 May 2002 after Akayev fired Bakiyev. He officially became PM eight days later when the Supreme Council confirmed him.

As Prime Minister he survived a motion of no confidence vote on 8 April 2004. The legislature voted 27 to 14 to remove him from office, short of the necessary 30 votes.

He was the first ethnic non-Asian Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan since independence.

==Revolution and exile==
On 24 March 2005 Tanayev resigned as Prime Minister in the midst of the Tulip Revolution. Almost a month later he became special envoy for foreign economic relations in his native Penza region in Russia. However, by June the Acting Prosecutor-General, Azimbek Beknazarov told Parliament that his office had issued an order for Tanayev&#x27;s arrest. One of the charges relates to 40 million soms ($977,000) in state funds allegedly transferred to a company controlled by his son. He lived in exile in St. Petersburg on 6 Bolshaya Morskaya Street.

<text>Bounnhang Vorachit (; born 15 August 1937) is a Laotian politician. He was previously General Secretary of the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party and President of Laos from 2016 to 2021.

==Early life==
Bounnhang Vorachit joined the Pathet Lao resistance movement in 1951 and worked in the propaganda department of the armed forces in Savannakhet. In 1956, he was transferred to the fighting troops. He studied in Vietnam from 1958 to 1961, then returned to Laos to help prepare for the conquest of Luang Namtha Province. After the victory in Luang Namtha in 1962, he returned to Vietnam and studied at a military college.

In 1964, he returned to Laos and in 1969, became head of the organizing committee of the province Xieng Khuang. In 1972, he became Deputy Commander of the Northern Front in Luang Prabang Province. Here he also joined the coalition in 1974 and became party secretary of the defence forces of the neutral city Luang Prabang. In 1976 he became political leader of the armed forces of the northern half of the country. In 1978, he returned to Vietnam to study political theory. In 1981, he became political leader of the armed forces, and in the same year up to 1991, he also worked as Governor of Savannakhet Province until 1996, when he became Deputy Prime Minister.

==Political career==
Prior to becoming Prime Minister in 2001, he served as Deputy Prime Minister since 1996. In addition, he was from 1996 to 1999 Chairman of the Lao-Vietnamese Cooperation Committee and from 1999 to 2001 Minister of Finance. On 26 March 2001, he was elected Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) of Laos. On 8 June 2006, he was followed by the former 1st Deputy Prime Minister Bouasone Bouphavanh in the office of Prime Minister. He himself became vice-president of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Laos on March 8, 2006 and thus deputy to Choummaly Sayasone.

Bounnhang&#x27;s ties with Vietnam run deep. He underwent military training there and, after taking part in founding the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic in 1975, he studied socialist thought there.

He became Vice President on 8 June 2006, when Bouasone Bouphavanh was appointed as Prime Minister. At the 10th Congress of the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party, he was elected to succeed Choummaly Sayasone as General Secretary on 22 January 2016, effectively making him the leader of Laos.
Bounnhang Vorachit is married to Khammeung Vorachit and is the father of three sons and two daughters. One of his daughters, Bounkham Vorachit, was elected to the 11th LPRP Central Committee.

At the 11th congress of the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (2021), he stepped down as General Secretary in favor of Thongloun Sisoulith.

<doc id="394985" wikidata="Q192778" url="?curid=394985" title="Rafic Hariri">
<text>Rafic Bahaa El Deen al-Hariri (; 1 November 1944 – 14 February 2005) was a Lebanese businessman and politician who served as prime minister of Lebanon from 1992 to 1998 and again from 2000 to 2004.
Hariri headed five cabinets during his tenure. He was widely credited for his role in constructing the Taif Agreement that ended the 15-year Lebanese Civil War. He also played a huge role in reconstructing the Lebanese capital, Beirut. He was the first post-civil war prime minister and the most influential and wealthiest Lebanese politician at the time. During Hariri&#x27;s first term as prime minister, tensions between Israel and Lebanon increased, as a result of the Qana massacre. In 2000, during his second premiership, his biggest achievement was the Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, ending an 18-year old occupation, while his government solidified relations with Ba&#x27;athist Syria.

On 14 February 2005, Hariri was assassinated in a suicide truck bomb explosion in Beirut. Four Hezbollah members of Unit 121 were indicted for the assassination and were tried &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. Salim Ayyash, the unit&#x27;s leader was convicted for his role in the assasination. The Tribunal eventually convicted three Hezbollah members before it&#x27;s closure in 2023, but stated that it could find no evidence that the bombing had been directed by the group&#x27;s senior leadership. The assassination was a catalyst for dramatic political change in Lebanon. The massive protests of the Cedar Revolution helped achieve the withdrawal of Syrian troops and security forces from Lebanon and a change in government.

At one point, Hariri was one of the world&#x27;s 100 wealthiest men and the fourth-richest politician.

==Early life and education==
Hariri was born on 1 November 1944 to a modest Sunni Muslim family in the Lebanese port city of Sidon. He had two siblings (brother Shafic and sister Bahia). He attended elementary and secondary school in Sidon, and graduated in business administration from Beirut Arab University.

==Business career==
In 1965, Hariri went to Saudi Arabia to work. There, he taught for a short period of time before moving to the construction industry. In 1978, he gained Saudi Arabian citizenship, in addition to his Lebanese citizenship.

In 1969, Hariri established Ciconest, a small subcontracting firm, which soon went out of business. He then went into business with the French construction firm Oger for the construction of a hotel in Ta’if, Saudi Arabia, the timely construction of which earned him praise from King Khaled. Hariri took over Oger, forming Saudi Oger, which became the main construction firm used by the Saudi Royal family for all their important developments. As a result, a few years after his first contract with King Khaled, Hariri had become a multi-billionaire.

Having accumulated his wealth, Hariri started a number of philanthropic projects, including the building of educational facilities in Lebanon. His first initiative in Lebanon was the Islamic Association for Culture and Education, which he founded in 1979. The association was later renamed the Hariri Foundation. Hariri became progressively more embroiled in politics. His appeals to the United Nations and services as an emissary to the Saudi Royal family won him international recognition on the political stage for his humanitarian efforts.

In 1982, Hariri donated $12 million to Lebanese victims of the 1978 South Lebanon conflict and helped clean up Beirut&#x27;s streets with his company&#x27;s money and contributed to early reconstruction efforts during lulls in the Lebanon war. Said to have heavily financed opposing militias during the war, his former deputy Najah Wakim later accused him of helping to destroy downtown Beirut to rebuild it again and make billions of dollars in the process. After the conflict, he acted as an envoy of the Saudi royal family to Lebanon. He laid the groundwork that led to the 1989 Taif Accord, which Saudi Arabia organised to bring the warring factions together. Taif put an end to the civil war, building goodwill for Hariri politically. While acting as the Saudi envoy to Lebanon, he spent more time in Damascus than in Beirut where he ingratiated himself with the Assad regime; he had a new presidential palace built in Damascus as a gift to the Syrian dictator but Assad didn&#x27;t use it personally.

==Political career==
Hariri returned to Lebanon in the early 1980s as a wealthy man and began to build a name for himself by making large donations and contributions to various groups in Lebanon. However, he continued to serve as a political advisor to Prince Bandar bin Sultan in 1983. He was implanted as the Saudis&#x27; strong man following the collapse of the PLO and the paucity of any viable Sunni leadership in the country as well as a response to the rising power of the Shiite militia Amal. As a former Saudi diplomatic representative, he played a significant role in constructing the 1990 Taif Agreement that ended Lebanon&#x27;s sixteen-year civil war. In 1992, Hariri became the first post-civil war prime minister of Lebanon under president Elias Hrawi. In addition, he was the minister of finance. After the 1996 elections he also took on the role of minister of post and telecommunications. Hariri put the country back on the financial map through the issuing of Eurobonds and won plaudits from the World Bank for his plan to borrow reconstruction money as the country&#x27;s debt grew to become the largest per capita in the world. Between 1992 and 1996 the public debt grew from $3 billion to $9 billion. His first premiership lasted until 1998, and Hariri was replaced by Salim Hoss as prime minister. In fact, as a result of the power struggle between Hariri and newly elected president Émile Lahoud, he left office.

In October 2000, Hariri was again appointed prime minister, replacing Salim Hoss, and formed the cabinet. In September 2004, Hariri defended UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which called for &quot;all remaining foreign forces to withdraw from Lebanon.&quot; On 20 October 2004, his second term ended when he resigned from office. Omar Karami succeeded him as prime minister.

== First premiership (1992–1998) ==

=== Economic policies ===
Hariri implemented an aggressive new economic policy. In 1992, inflation was running at 131% but such was the confidence in Hariri&#x27;s leadership that within two years it had been reduced to 12%. Perhaps Hariri&#x27;s most important creation in the beginning of his career was &quot;Horizon 2000&quot;, the government&#x27;s name for its new rejuvenation plan. A large component of &quot;Horizon 2000&quot; was Solidere, the privately owned construction company that was established to reconstruct post-war Lebanon. Solidere was owned by the government and private investors. Solidere was largely focused on redeveloping Beirut&#x27;s downtown and turning it into a new urban center as quickly as possible as one aspect of the various infrastructure redevelopment plans that would be implemented by &quot;Horizon 2000&quot;. Solidere was given powers of compulsory purchase, compensating in Solidere shares rather than cash, and was accused of harassment and underpaying former land owners. Another aspect of the decade-long plan was the privatization of major industries. Numerous contracts were awarded in important industries such as energy, telecommunications, electricity, airports, and roads.

The last and perhaps most significant aspect of &quot;Horizon 2000&quot; was economic stimulus via foreign direct investment. Specifically, Hariri supported foreign firms and individuals taking an interest in Lebanon&#x27;s developmental potential. Hariri simplified tax codes and provided tax breaks to foreign investors. Due to his previous successes in the private sector and the numerous resulting international connections, Hariri was able to garner a significant amount of low-interest loans from foreign investors. Hariri also pursued aggressive macroeconomic policy such as maintaining strict regulations on bank reserves and inter-bank interest rates to curb inflation and raise the value of the Lebanese pound relative to the dollar.

Hariri&#x27;s economic policies were a remarkable success during his first year in office. From 1992 to 1993, there was a 6% increase in real national income, the capital base of commercial banks effectively doubled, the budgetary earnings hovered at around a billion dollars, and commercial banks&#x27; consolidated balance sheets increased about 25%. By 1998, however, real GDP growth was around 1%, a year later it would be −1%, national debt had skyrocketed 540% from two to eighteen billion dollars.

In 1996, it was estimated that 30% of Lebanon&#x27;s population were living below the poverty line and that there were 500,000 Syrian laborers working illegally in the country.

=== Criticism ===
August 11, 1994, the Hariri government issued a ban on organized demonstrations, relying on the Lebanese Army to enforce the decree. According to Human Rights Watch, following the demonstration ban, on September 13, 1994, &quot;army troops used force to disperse demonstrations, with disastrous results: seven men and one woman were killed and about forty other peaceful demonstrators injured.&quot; On 17 September 1996, Information Minister Farid Makari ordered a ban on the broadcasting of news programs. This was followed eight days later by a government decree ordering the closure of Lebanon&#x27;s 150 privately owned radio stations and 50 TV stations. Licenses were then issued to Hariri&#x27;s Future Television, the Christian-owned Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International (LBCI), Murr Television (MTV) owned by the brother of Interior Minister Michel Murr, and the National Broadcasting Network (NBN), set up by Nabih Berri. The radio stations which were given licenses were Hariri&#x27;s Orient Radio, Berri&#x27;s NBN, and the Lebanese Forces’s Voice of Free Lebanon. The following year, however, &quot;the cabinet handed out licenses to one television station and eight radio stations, including Hizballah&#x27;s Al-Manar TV, Voice of Lebanon (formerly owned by the Phalange party), and Voice of the People (Communist Party).&quot; These groups had been previously excluded from licensing in September 1996. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the ongoing Syrian occupation and military presence in Lebanon made it difficult for Lebanese media to criticize the Syrian regime, adding that &quot;Syria&#x27;s continued dominant political and military influence&quot; created an atmosphere of self-censorship. 

== Second premiership (2000—2004) ==

=== Hariri and Lebanon&#x27;s political environment ===

Amid the political crisis brought on by the extension of President Émile Lahoud&#x27;s term, Hariri resigned as Prime Minister, saying: &quot;I have... submitted the resignation of the government, and I have declared that I will not be a candidate to head the (next) government.&quot;

During a BBC interview in 2001, Hariri was asked by Tim Sebastian why he refused to hand over members of Hezbollah that were accused by America of being terrorists. He responded that Hezbollah were the ones protecting Lebanon against the Israeli occupation and called for implementation of passed United Nations resolutions against Israel. 

During the interview, also accused of making the American coalition in the War on Terrorism worthless and asked if he was ready for the consequences of his refusal, reminding him that George W. Bush had said: &quot;Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.&quot; He replied that he had hoped there would be no consequences, but would deal with them if they arrive. Hariri also said that he opposed the killing of all humans – Israeli, Palestinian, Syrian or Lebanese – and believed in dialogue as a solution. He further went on to say that Syria would have to stay in Lebanon for protection of Lebanon until they are no longer needed and Lebanon asks them to leave.

=== Opposition to Syrian occupation ===
Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, a recent recruit of the anti-Syrian opposition, emboldened by popular anger and civic action now being called Lebanon&#x27;s Cedar Revolution, alleged in the wake of the assassination that on 26 August 2004 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad threatened Hariri, saying &quot;[President of Lebanon] Lahoud is me. ... If you and Chirac want me out of Lebanon, I will break Lebanon.&quot; He was quoted as saying &quot;When I heard him telling us those words, I knew that it was his condemnation of death.&quot; This meeting between Hariri and Assad, which had been on 26 August 2004, lasted for just fifteen minutes.

=== Criticism ===
Hariri was accused of corruption, which plagued Lebanon during the Syrian occupation. The Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut&#x27;s Central District (French: &quot;Société Libanaise pour le Développement et la Reconstruction du Centre-ville de Beyrouth&quot;), more commonly known by the French-derived acronym &quot;Solidere&quot;, expropriated most property in the central business district of Beirut, compensating each owner with shares in the company which were worth as little as 15% of the property&#x27;s value. As the primary shareholder of the company, Hariri and his business associates profited from this project. Moreover, it was reported by &quot;Middle East International in&quot; November 1996 that $26 million had been embezzled from the Lebanese Ministry of Finance while Hariri was in office in office. Hariri was accused of allowing allowed kickbacks from public spending to enrich government figures. For instance, contracts for the import of petroleum were awarded to the two sons of President Elias Hrawi.

==Personal life==
Hariri married twice. He had six children. In 1965, he married an Iraqi woman, Nidal Bustani, who is the mother of his three sons; Bahaa (born 1967), who is a businessman, Saad (born 1970), who succeeded his father as leader of the future movement, and Houssam—who died in a traffic accident in the US in the late 1980s. They divorced. He married his second spouse, Nazik Audi, in 1976 and she is the mother of three of Hariri&#x27;s children: Ayman, Fahd and Hind.

From 1982 until his death, Hariri owned 2–8a Rutland Gate, a large house in London&#x27;s Knightsbridge district. The house was gifted to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Sultan bin Abdulaziz, after Hariri&#x27;s assassination.

==Assassination==
On 14 February 2005, Hariri was killed when explosives equivalent to around of TNT concealed inside a parked Mitsubishi van were detonated as his motorcade drove near the St. George Hotel in Beirut. 23 people, including Hariri himself, were killed. Among the dead were several of Hariri&#x27;s bodyguards and his friend and former Minister of the Economy Bassel Fleihan. Hariri was buried along with his bodyguards, who died in the bombing, in a location near Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque.

A 2006 report by Serge Brammertz indicated that DNA evidence collected from the crime scene suggests that the assassination might be the act of a young male suicide bomber.

In its first two reports in 2014, the United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission indicated that the Syrian government may be linked to the assassination. Lawyers tasked with prosecuting those responsible for the 2005 bombing said they had received evidence linking Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s phone to the case. In its tenth report, the UNIIIC concluded &quot;that a network of individuals acted in concert to carry out the assassination of Rafic Hariri.&quot;

Although Hezbollah blamed the assassination on Israel, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation news investigation stated that the special UN investigation team had found evidence for the responsibility of Unit 121 of Hezbollah in the assassination. A UN-backed tribunal issued four arrest warrants to members of Hezbollah. Later, Hezbollah members Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi, Hussein Hassan Oneissi, and Assad Hassan Sabra have been indicted for the assassination and were tried &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.

===Funeral &amp; Memorial Commemoration===
Hariri was well regarded among international leaders. He was one of French President Jacques Chirac&#x27;s closest friends. Chirac was one of the first foreign dignitaries to travel to Lebanon, where he personally offered his condolences to Hariri&#x27;s widow, Nazik Hariri at her home in Beirut. He also attended the funeral, accompanied by his wife, Bernadette Chirac.

Among the foreign dignitaries attending the burial in Beirut were several European and Arab ministers, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, US Assistant Secretary of State William J. Burns, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud bin Faisal Al Saud, and Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa.

Approximately 200,000 people gathered in Martyr&#x27;s Square to get a glimpse of the coffin draped in Lebanon&#x27;s red, white, and green flag. Christians, Muslims, and Druze marched together in the procession, which concluded at the Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, a structure Hariri had built in Beirut Central District. Church bells rang out, blending with the resounding calls to Islamic prayers and the beat of a military band&#x27;s drums. The attendees turned the funeral of Hariri on February 16, 2005, into a powerful display of public anger against Syria, blamed by opposition leaders for the bomb that killed him, with some witnesses estimating that hundreds of thousands of mourners flooded the nearby streets in one of Lebanon&#x27;s largest and most diverse gatherings in decades.

A month later, on March 14, 2005, to commemorate the one-month anniversary of his assassination, between 1.2 and 1.5 million people gathered in Martyr&#x27;s Square for the memorial service, marking the largest public assembly in the country&#x27;s history to date.
 People from all sects and regions of Lebanon, from Wadi Khaled in the north to Ain Ebel in the south, gathered to demand an end to Syria&#x27;s occupation of Lebanon. About a month later, under increasing international pressure, Syria withdrew after a thirty-year-long occupation.

===Aftermath===

 The Special Tribunal for Lebanon was also created at his instigation. Syria was initially accused of the assassination, which led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon following widespread protests.

Major General Jamil Al Sayyed, then head of Lebanese General Security, Brigadier General Mustafa Hamdan, Major General Ali Hajj and Brigadier General Raymond Azar were all arrested in August 2005 at the request of German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis, who was carrying out the UN investigation about the assassination. Sayyed was one of the persons who decided to assassinate Rafic Hariri according to a leaked draft version of the Mehlis report along with other Syrian high-rank intelligence and security officers and officials, namely Assef Shawkat, Maher Assad, Hassan Khalil and Bahjat Suleyman. However, later reports about the assassination did not repeat the allegations against Jamil Al Sayyed and other three Lebanese generals. Four Lebanese generals were held in Roumieh prison, northeast of Beirut from 2005 to 2009. They were released from the prison due to lack of evidence in 2009.

Following Hariri&#x27;s death, there were several other bombings and assassinations against minor anti-Syrian figures. These included Samir Kassir, George Hawi, Gebran Tueni, Pierre Amine Gemayel, Antoine Ghanem and Walid Eido. Assassination attempts were made on Elias Murr, May Chidiac, and Samir Shehade (who was investigating Hariri&#x27;s death).

An indictment against alleged Hezbollah members Salim Jamil Ayyash, Mustafa Amine Badreddine, Hussein Hassan Oneissi, and Assad Hassan Sabra was issued and confirmed by the Pre-Trial Judge of the United Nations special tribunal (see Special Tribunal for Lebanon) in 2011. In February 2014, the case against Hassan Habib Merhi was joined with the &quot;Ayyash et al.&quot; case. Proceedings against the accused Mustafa Badreddine were terminated in July 2016 following credible reports of his death. Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi, Hussein Hassan Oneissi, and Assad Hassan Sabra currently remain on trial &quot;in absentia&quot;.

In 2009 the German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported that some of the evidence supporting the indictment of Hezbollah involved a number of cellphones purchased in Tripoli shortly before the assassination, and were used by members of Hezbollah solely for the coordination of the assassination, except for a call from one of them to his girlfriend. The ties to Hezbollah were exposed by Captain Wissam Eid of the Lebanese Internal Security Force, who was assassinated himself before the conclusion of the investigation, as was Lebanese Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, one of the leading figures of the Special tribunal. 

In August 2010, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah presented intercepted Israeli spy-drone video footage to CNN, which he said implicated Israel because &quot;they were tracking Hariri&#x27;s whereabouts and the roads that he took every day.&quot; When asked what Israel&#x27;s motive would have been, Nasrallah said, &quot;They just wanted to start an internal strife.&quot; 

After an altercation between male Tribunal staff and women at a gynecology clinic in October 2010, Hezbollah demanded that the Lebanese government stop all cooperation with the Special Tribunal investigation, claiming the tribunal to be an infringement on Lebanese sovereignty by Western governments. 

On 1 November 2010, a report was leaked by &quot;Al Akhbar&quot;, a local secular, leftist newspaper, stating that Hezbollah drafted plans for a quick takeover of the country in the case an indictment against its members is issued by the UN Special Tribunal. The report states that Hezbollah conducted a simulation of the plan on 28 October, immediately following a speech by its secretary general.

On the other side, it was revealed by leaked US embassy cables that then Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate director Omar Suleiman reported that Syria &quot;desperately&quot; wanted to stop the investigation of the Tribunal.

In 2024, Salim Jamil Ayyash, the assassin of Hariri was reportedly killed by an IDF strike near al-Qusayr in the Homs region.

== Legacy ==
On 22 June 2005, Beirut International Airport was renamed Rafic Hariri International Airport. Additionally, Beirut General University hospital was renamed Rafiq Hariri Hospital. Rafic Hariri was succeeded by his son Saad Hariri as leader of the Future Party.

<text>Bethuel Pakalitha Mosisili (born 14 March 1945) is a former Mosotho politician who was the fourth prime minister of Lesotho from May 1998 to June 2012 and again from March 2015 to June 2017. He led the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) to a near-total victory in the 1998 election, and under his leadership the party also won majorities in the 2002 and 2007 elections. While serving as Prime Minister, Mosisili was also Minister of Defence.

Following the snap election held on 28 February 2015, he formed and led a coalition government. He was sworn in on 17 March 2015.

==Early life and career==
Mosisili was born at Waterfall in Qacha&#x27;s Nek on March 14, 1945. He was educated at the Eagle&#x27;s Peak High School, where he attained his Cambridge Overseas School Certificate in 1965. He did his primary schooling at Tebellong, Souru and Tsoelike and then pursued his higher education at the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland and graduated with a BA in Education.
Upon graduation in July 1970, he was imprisoned because of his political activism and was released the next year in November. He was a member of the Basotho Congress Party.

In 1976, he attained his MA from the University of Wisconsin in the United States and then completed a BA honours program via distance education from the University of South Africa. In 1982, he graduated from Simon Fraser University in Canada with a Master of Education degree.

==Political career==
In 1993, Mosisili was elected to parliament from the Qacha&#x27;s Nek Constituency and became Minister of Education. On April 14, 1994, he was briefly kidnapped along with three other ministers by soldiers; a fifth minister, Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo, was killed in this incident. Mosisili was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in late January 1995, while remaining Minister of Education; on July 20, 1995, he was named Minister of Home Affairs and Local Government instead, while remaining Deputy Prime Minister. A new ruling party, the LCD, was formed in 1997 under the leadership of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle as a split from the Basutoland Congress Party. On February 21, 1998, Mosisili was elected leader of the LCD after Mokhehle chose to step down due to poor health.

After his party&#x27;s victory in 1998 there were accusations of vote rigging and mass protests from the opposition parties, which culminated with their occupation of the grounds to the palace. In the ensuing debacle which saw the army, police and king complicit in an attempt to unseat his government, Mosisili had to resort to asking the regional grouping, Southern African Development Community (SADC), for an intervention to stem the imminent coup. To this end, joint force, consisting of South African and (later) Botswana troops, entered Lesotho on September 22, 1998, to put down the mutiny and restore the democratically elected government.

New elections were eventually held in May 2002, which his party won, this after a major split led by his former deputy, Kelebone Maope, and Shakhane Mokhehle, the brother of the late founder of his party. On this occasion, Mosisili himself was elected to a seat from the Tsoelike constituency, receiving 79.2% of the vote; in his previous constituency, Qacha&#x27;s Nek, Pontso Sekatle was the LCD candidate.

In October 2006, Tom Thabane left the LCD and formed a new party, the All Basotho Convention (ABC), and 17 other members of parliament joined him; this left the LCD with a narrow majority of 61 out of 120 seats. On Mosisili&#x27;s advice, King Letsie III dissolved parliament on November 24, 2006, and a new election was scheduled for February 17, 2007; they had previously been expected in April or May. The LCD won this election, taking 61 seats; the National Independent Party, allied with the LCD, won an additional 21 seats.

Whilst attending a funeral in his home district of Qacha&#x27;s Nek in late 2006, Mosisili gave a speech which quoted a Basotho idiom, &quot;Se sa feleng sea hlola&quot;, meaning &quot;anything that does not finish/end is not good&quot;. Some believed that he was referring to his term in office and his embattled political party.

Armed men attacked Mosisili&#x27;s residence on April 22, 2009, apparently intending to kill him; three of the attackers, one of whom was reportedly a soldier, were killed by police, and Mosisili was unharmed. Six people appeared before a South African court in July 2009 on charges of helping in the attempt. The Lesotho Communications Minister described the attack as a plot by South African and Mozambican mercenaries to stage a coup in Lesotho.

Following the snap election held on 28 February 2015, he managed to form and lead a coalition government. Two years later, on 1 March 2017, he was defeated in a parliamentary vote of confidence, and an early election was expected to be held, although the opposition wanted Mosisili to step aside and allow Monyane Moleleki, Mosisili&#x27;s former deputy turned rival, to take over. Mosisili then advised King Letsie III to dissolve Parliament, and the King did so on 7 March, despite an opposition effort to obstruct the move.

The election was held on 3 June 2017 and resulted in a victory for Tom Thabane and his party, the ABC, which won 48 seats against 30 for Mosisili&#x27;s Democratic Congress. A government statement on 8 June said that Mosisili had submitted his resignation to King Letsie but would continue in a caretaker capacity. Thabane succeeded Mosisili as Prime Minister on 16 June.

In November 2018, Mosisili announced his retirement from politics. The Democratic Congress held its elective conference in January 2019 and Mathibeli Mokhothu was elected as his successor. Mokhothu had served as a government minister in Mosisili&#x27;s last cabinet.

==Personal life==
He is married to Mathato Mosisili.

<doc id="394988" wikidata="Q739669" url="?curid=394988" title="Black Kettle">
<text>Black Kettle (Cheyenne: Mo&#x27;ohtavetoo&#x27;o) (November 27, 1868) was a leader of the Southern Cheyenne during the American Indian Wars. Born to the &quot;Northern Só&#x27;taeo&#x27;o / Só&#x27;taétaneo&#x27;o&quot; band of the Northern Cheyenne in the Black Hills of present-day South Dakota, he later married into the &quot;Wotápio / Wutapai&quot; band (one mixed Cheyenne-Kiowa band with Lakota Sioux origin) of the Southern Cheyenne.

Black Kettle is often remembered as a peacemaker who accepted treaties with the U.S. government to protect his people. On November 27, 1868, while attempting to escape the Battle of Washita River with his wife, he was shot and killed by soldiers of the U.S. 7th Cavalry.

==Early life==
Black Kettle was born around 1803 in South Dakota into the Cheyenne Nation. Little is known of Black Kettle&#x27;s life prior to 1854, when he was made a chief of the Council of Forty-four, the central government of the Cheyenne tribe. The Council met regularly at the Sun Dance gatherings, where they affirmed unity.

After 1851, relations between the Cheyenne and the U.S. government were nominally conducted under the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Still, the U.S. government remained unwilling to control white expansion into the Great Plains, particularly after the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush began in 1859. European Americans displaced the Cheyenne from their lands in violation of the treaty, and consumed important resources of water and game. Increasing competition eventually led to armed conflict between the groups.

Chief Black Kettle was a pragmatist who believed that U.S. military power and the number of immigrants were overwhelming and unable to be resisted. In 1861, he and the Arapaho surrendered to the commander of Fort Lyon under the Treaty of Fort Wise, believing he could gain protection for his people. The treaty was highly unfavorable to the Southern Cheyenne. Black Kettle visited Washington, D.C., where President Abraham Lincoln gave him a large American flag.

The Cheyenne led their bands to the Sand Creek reservation, which occupied a small corner of southeastern Colorado Territory about 40 miles from Fort Lyon. The land was not arable and was located far away from buffalo, their major source of meat. Many Cheyenne warriors, including the Dog Soldiers, did not accept the treaty and began to attack white settlers. Whether Black Kettle opposed these actions, tolerated them, or encouraged them remains controversial among historians.

==Colorado War==

By the summer of 1864, the situation had reached a boiling point. Southern Cheyenne hardliners, along with allied Kiowa and Arapaho bands, raided American settlements for livestock and supplies. Sometimes they took captives, generally only women and children, to adopt into their tribes as replacements for lost members. On June 11, 1864, indigenous people killed a family of settlers, an attack which the white people called the Hungate massacre after the family. Pro-war white people displayed the scalped bodies in Denver. Colorado governor John Evans believed tribal chiefs had ordered the attack and were intent on a full-scale war.

Evans issued a proclamation ordering all &quot;Friendly Indians of the Plains&quot; to report to military posts or be considered &quot;hostile&quot;. He sought and gained from the War Department authorization to establish the Third Colorado Cavalry. Colonel John M. Chivington led the unit, composed predominantly of &quot;100-daysers&quot;, who enlisted for limited 100-day terms specifically for fighting against the Cheyenne and Arapaho.

Black Kettle decided to accept Evans&#x27; offer and entered negotiations. On September 28, he concluded a peace settlement at Fort Weld outside Denver. The agreement assigned the Southern Cheyenne to the Sand Creek reservation and required them to report to Fort Lyon, formerly Fort Wise. Black Kettle believed the agreement would ensure the safety of his people. After he went to the reservation, the commanding officer at the fort was replaced by one who was an ally of Chivington.

===Betrayal at Sand Creek===
Ambitious, Chivington felt pressure from Governor Evans to make use of the Third Colorado Cavalry before their terms expired at the end of 1864. On November 28, Chivington arrived with 700 men at Fort Lyon. According to an eyewitness, John S. Smith:
[H]e stopped all persons from going on ahead of him. He stopped the mail, and would not allow any person to go on ahead of him at the time he was on his way from Denver city to Fort Lyon. He placed a guard around old Colonel Bent, the former agent there; he stopped a Mr. Hagues and many men who were on their way to Fort Lyon. He took the fort by surprise, and as soon as he got there he posted pickets all around the fort, and then left at 8 o&#x27;clock that night for this Indian camp.

At dawn on November 29, Chivington attacked the Sand Creek reservation; the event became known as the Sand Creek massacre. Most of the warriors were out hunting. Following Indian agent instructions, Black Kettle flew an American flag and a white flag from his tipi, but the signal was ignored. The 3rd Colorado Cavalry killed 163 Cheyenne by shooting or stabbing. They burned down the village encampment. Most of the victims were women and children. For months afterward, members of the militia displayed trophies in Denver of their battle, including body parts they had taken for souvenirs.

===Aftermath===
Black Kettle escaped the massacre and returned to rescue his severely injured wife, who suffered nine bullet and shrapnel wounds. He continued to counsel pacifism, believing that military resistance was doomed to fail. The majority of the Southern Cheyenne chiefs disagreed. Allied with the Comanche and Kiowa, they went to war against U.S. civilians and military forces.

Black Kettle said of that time:
Black Kettle moved south and continued to negotiate with U.S. officials. He signed the Treaty of Little Arkansas River on October 14, 1865. By this document, the U.S. promised &quot;perpetual peace&quot; and lands in reparation for the Sand Creek massacre. However, its practical effect was to dispossess the Cheyenne yet again and require them to move to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Black Kettle&#x27;s influence continued to wane. Roman Nose and his Dog Soldiers took a prevailing hard line and continued warfare.

==Medicine Lodge Treaty==
Black Kettle&#x27;s dwindling band proclaimed their desire to live peacefully alongside European Americans. Black Kettle signed yet another treaty, the Medicine Lodge Treaty, on October 28, 1867. The Dog Soldiers continued their raids and ambushes across Kansas, Texas, and Colorado.

The relationship between the two groups is a subject of historical dispute. According to Little Rock, second-in-command of Black Kettle&#x27;s village, most of the warriors came back to Black Kettle&#x27;s camp after their attacks. White prisoners, including children, were held within his encampment. By this time Black Kettle&#x27;s influence was waning, and it is unclear whether he could have stopped the younger warriors&#x27; actions.

==Battle of Washita River==
In response to the continued raids and massacres, General Philip Sheridan devised a plan of punitive reprisals. He planned to attack Cheyenne winter encampments, destroying both supplies and livestock, and killing any people who resisted. At dawn on the morning of November 27, 1868, Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer led his 7th Cavalry Regiment to attack Chief Black Kettle and his village along the Washita River in what is now western Oklahoma. Custer&#x27;s troops killed more than 100 Native Americans, mostly Southern Cheyenne.

==Death and legacy==
While trying to cross the Washita River, Black Kettle and his wife were shot in the back and killed. 

The Cheyenne have recognized Black Kettle as a peacemaker. Black Kettle National Grassland in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma and Hemphill County, Texas is named after him. Near the site of his death, in present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma, the Black Kettle Museum commemorates his legacy.

==In popular culture==
Black Kettle was a recurring character in the CBS family drama &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; for its first three seasons, played by Nick Ramus. Black Kettle plays a key role for the series in the pilot episode. Dr. Quinn saves Black Kettle&#x27;s life by performing a tracheotomy and removing a bullet lodged in his neck. She later receives a Cheyenne name from Black Kettle meaning &quot;Medicine Woman&quot;.

Black Kettle and the fate of his village are featured in Episode 4 of TNT miniseries &quot;Into the West&quot;. Black Kettle is portrayed by Wes Studi.

On ska band Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s &quot;Our Newest Album Ever!&quot;, the song &quot;Banner Year&quot; is about Black Kettle, how he was betrayed, and his eventual murder at the hands of Custer.

Deathcab for Cutie&#x27;s 2022 album Asphalt Meadows references Black Kettle during the Sand Creek Massacre in the song/spoken word piece &quot;Foxglove Through The Clearcut.&quot;

<text>Allan Kemakeza (born 11 September 1950) was the prime minister of Solomon Islands from 2001 to 2006. He represented Savo/Russel Constituency in the National Parliament of Solomon Islands from 1989 to 2010 and was most recently Minister of Forestry December 2007 to August 2010. He served as Speaker of the National Parliament, from September 2010 to 2014.

== Overview ==


Kemakeza was born on the island of Savo. He joined the police force in 1972 and served in various positions until he resigned in December 1988 in order to stand in the 1989 parliamentary election. He won a seat from Savo/Russel in that election, and in 1989, he was also appointed Minister for Police and Justice, serving in that position until 1990. From 1991 to 1993, he served as Minister for Housing and Government Services; he was re-elected in the May 1993 election and was Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 1993 to 1994. He was Minister for Forests, Environment &amp; Conservation from 1995 to 1996. Re-elected to Parliament in the August 1997 election, he became Deputy Leader of the Opposition again in that year.

In June 2000, Kemakeza was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace under Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. In August 2001, Kemakeza was sacked from these positions by Sogavare following allegations of corruption. Further controversy surfaced when he received SI$850,000 as part of a program compensating individuals who lost property during the Civil War. Kemakeza denies the allegations of corruption.

His People&#x27;s Alliance Party won 20 of 49 seats in the parliamentary election of 5 December 2001, becoming the largest party in parliament. He was elected as prime minister by Parliament on 17 December 2001 in the first round of voting, receiving 29 votes out of the 50 seats in parliament, and sworn in on 19 December 2001.

Before he became prime minister, there was much turmoil in Solomon Islands because of rivalry between militias from the various islands, which reached its height in June 2000, when a coup took place. Problems still continue today, but Kemakeza&#x27;s government allowed the international community, including peacekeepers, to help solve the problems.

An Australian-led peace-keeping force named RAMSI (Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands) is in place, based in Honiara. He has attracted some controversy through his 2005 visit to Japan&#x27;s Yasukuni War Shrine, which honours Japanese WWII combatants and 14 convicted war criminals.

Kemakeza remained in office through a full four-year parliamentary term, a distinguishing feat in Solomon Islands politics; he survived three motions of no confidence during the term. At the end of the parliamentary term in December 2005, Parliament was dissolved and Kemakeza and his Cabinet served in a caretaker capacity until the next election, which was held on 5 April 2006. In this election, Kemakeza&#x27;s People&#x27;s Alliance Party lost more than 10 seats; Kemakeza himself was re-elected to his seat. Kemakeza soon announced his resignation as prime minister, but one of his allies, Deputy Prime Minister Snyder Rini, was elected to succeed him. Kemakeza was appointed leader of the governing coalition and it seemed that he would still have much power within the government. His term as prime minister was to end on 19 April, but he remained in office until the following day because of riots over Rini&#x27;s controversial election. He became Deputy Speaker of the National Parliament on 24 April 2006, having been elected with 25 votes from the members of the 50-seat Parliament.

In early November 2007, Kemakaza was convicted of demanding money with menace, intimidation and larceny in connection with a raid that he allegedly ordered in May 2002 on a law firm, Sol Law, in Honiara. The raid was allegedly an attempt to drive the firm&#x27;s Australian lawyers, who Kemakeza thought held too much influence over national financial institutions, out of Solomon Islands. He faced a potential prison sentence as a result of the conviction. After the conviction, it was reported that he discussed a deal with Sogavare&#x27;s government for a pardon. The government claimed that Kemakeza had left the opposition and was named as the chairman of the board of the Solomon Islands Water Authority, but Kemakeza denied this and said that he was not making a deal. In December, Kemakeza, having previously been neutral, backed the opposition led by Fred Fono; soon afterward, Sogavare&#x27;s government was defeated in a no-confidence vote. Kemakeza eventually served a five-month prison sentence in 2008.

Following Sogavare&#x27;s defeat, Kemakeza became Minister of Forestry under Prime Minister Derek Sikua on 22 December 2007, leaving the post of Deputy Speaker on that date.

He lost his seat, and Cabinet position, in the August 2010 general election. He then announced he was a candidate for the position of Speaker of the National Parliament, to be chosen from outside Parliament. Two other former MPs, who had likewise lost their seat in the 2010 election, Francis Billy Hilly and Fred Fono, also stood for the job of Speaker. Kemakeza was elected by Parliament with 27 votes, to 17 for Billy Hilly and 4 for Fono.

<doc id="394990" wikidata="Q471125" url="?curid=394990" title="Shukri Ghanem">
<text>Shukri Mohammed Ghanem ( 9 October 1942 – 29 April 2012) was a Libyan politician who was the General Secretary of the General People&#x27;s Committee of Libya (prime minister) from June 2003 until March 2006 when, in the first major government reshuffle in over a decade, he was replaced by his deputy, Baghdadi Mahmudi. Ghanem subsequently served as the Minister of Oil until 2011. On 29 April 2012, his body was found floating on the New Danube, Vienna.

Early in the Libyan Civil War he reportedly &quot;fled&quot;, but after the city of Ra&#x27;s Lanuf was recaptured by pro-government forces, AP reported on 13 March that he asked Eni SpA for help with putting out a fire at the Ra&#x27;s Lanuf Refinery. On 16 May, Al Arabiya and the NTC reported that Shukri Ghanem had defected to Tunisia. The next day Tunisian security officials confirmed that he was indeed in Tunisia.

==Early life and education==
Ghanem was born in Tripoli, at the time capital of Italian Libya, on 9 October 1942. He studied economics at Garyounis University in Benghazi and graduated in 1963. He also held PhD in international economics from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and Harvard University in 1975.

==Career==
Ghanem was previously in charge of the OPEC secretariat, and was the director of its research division. He served as deputy director and director of foreign trade at the Ministry of Economy in Libya; was director of marketing of Libya&#x27;s National Oil Corporation (NOC); was director of economic affairs and under secretary and chief advisor at the Ministry of Petroleum in Libya. In 2003, Ghanem was appointed general secretary of the General People&#x27;s Committee or Prime Minister. In March 2006, Ghanem was appointed Chairman of Libya&#x27;s NOC. He tendered his resignation from NOC in August 2009 amidst probable disagreements within the Libyan government over the development of the oil sector.

After defection to Vienna in 2011, he served as a consultant for a Vienna-based company until his death.

==Post Lockerbie bombing raproachment==
Libya had been diplomatically isolated and subject to international sanctions since the November 1991 indictment of two Libyans for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 on 21 December 1988 (the Lockerbie bombing). Following Ghanem&#x27;s appointment as prime minister, Libya successfully sought re-entry into the international community and the lifting of sanctions. Ghanem was seen as the main spokesman and architect of this rapprochement, which included paying $2.16 billion compensation in August 2003 to the families of the 270 people who died in the bombing, and renouncing weapons of mass destruction.

In February 2004, Ghanem was interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Today&quot; program. He stirred controversy in the interview by repudiating Libya&#x27;s responsibility both for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and the 1984 murder of British WPC Yvonne Fletcher (who was shot and killed in April 1984 outside the Libyan Embassy in London). This incident led to the severing of UK/Libya diplomatic relations.

After the problems we [Libya] have been facing because of the sanctions, the loss of money, we thought that it was easier for us to buy peace and this is why we agreed a compensation,&quot; Ghanem said in the interview.

When asked whether the payment of compensation meant that Libya did not accept any guilt or responsibility, Ghanem replied:

I agree with that, and this is why I say we bought peace.

Under pressure from the United States and Britain, Ghanem&#x27;s comments were quickly retracted by Gaddafi.

It is unclear whether Shukri Ghanem&#x27;s dismissal as prime minister in 2006 was a consequence of those controversial remarks he made two years earlier.

==Libyan civil war==
On 16 May 2011, it was reported that Ghanem has defected from the Gaddafi government and fled, which was confirmed the next day by Tunisian security officials. On 8 April 2011, against the background of the Libyan Civil War, the US Treasury department announced sanctions against him. In May 2011, he defected to Rome and then, Vienna. On 1 June 2011, Ghanem confirmed in Rome, that he had decided to join the Libyan opposition.

He was mistrusted by the new Libyan government due to his close friendship with the Gaddafi family, and particularly Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. Prior to his death, the interim Libyan government was preparing an Interpol arrest warrant against him, to investigate his mismanagement of oil production. At the same time, he was also wanted as a witness in the trial against Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. His diary had also been acquired by investigators of financing allegations against French President Nicolas Sarkozy during the former president&#x27;s 2007 election campaign.

==Personal life==
Ghanem was married and had three daughters and one son.

==Death==
Ghanem then lived with his family in Vienna, Austria, where he had an apartment and where his daughters also lived. Prior to his death, Ghanem had expressed concerns about the latest developments in Libya. 
Ghanem&#x27;s body was found on 29 April 2012 in a branch of the River Danube. He was 69. An Austrian foreign ministry official said the family initially told the ministry that Ghanem had died of a heart attack, which was later denied by police. A BBC report noted the cause of death was not clear and that police had ordered a post-mortem. Toxicology tests were still being undertaken after Ghanem&#x27;s body had been released for burial. His body, in a coffin wrapped in a white flag, was returned to Tripoli and buried there at the beginning of May 2012.

== Posthumous allegations ==
On 1 May 2012, Reuters reported that Ghanem&#x27;s associates at other OPEC countries, including former Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Chalabi, did not believe the official account of his death.

In March 2019, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Ghanem was the go-between for many of the bribes paid to the Gaddafi regime by companies in the Western world, most notably Yara International. According to Norwegian and Swiss prosecutors, Ghanem&#x27;s son Mohammed served as the &quot;bag man&quot; in the Yara case and Yara had deposited at least $1.5 million into an account belonging to a company registered in the British Virgin Islands that was operated by Mohammed Ghanem. Dutch prosecutors were simultaneously pursuing a case against a $700 million hedge fund operated by Ghanem&#x27;s son-in-law, Ismael Abudher. According to Dutch investigators, Abudher owned at least twelve British Virgin Islands shell companies and were using them to embezzle money from Libya&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority.

In June 2022, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; alleged that Ghanem was worth billions of Qaddafi&#x27;s ill-gotten money at the time of his death due to corruption and raised the possibility that his death was due to foul play.

<doc id="394992" wikidata="Q6046657" url="?curid=394992" title="Interim leader (Canada)">
<text>An interim leader, in Canadian politics, is a party leader appointed by the party&#x27;s legislative caucus or the party&#x27;s executive to temporarily act as leader when a gap occurs between the resignation or death of a party leader and the election of their formal successor. Usually a party leader retains the leadership until a successor is formally chosen — however, in some situations this is not possible, and an interim leader is thus appointed by the party&#x27;s caucus or the party executive. An interim leader may also be appointed while a leader is on a leave of absence due to poor health or some other reason, and then relinquish the position upon the leader&#x27;s return.

An interim leader has all the rights and responsibilities of an elected party leader, with the exception that the person does not have the discretion to choose the timing of their departure — an interim leader serves only until the party organizes and holds a leadership convention. By virtue of lacking a mandate from the party membership, however, an interim leader is not generally seen as possessing the authority to truly put his or her own ideological and organizational stamp on the party, and is thus effectively limited to a caretaker role in most cases.

There have been a number of instances where instead of a competitive leadership race between multiple candidates, the leadership convention directly ratified the interim leader as the party&#x27;s new permanent leader, but a convention must still take place in some form.

By convention, if a competitive leadership race between sitting members of the party&#x27;s caucus is taking place, the interim leader should normally be a caucus member who is not standing as a candidate in the leadership race, so they do not gain unfair advantage in the contest. Only in rare cases, such as when a minor party&#x27;s interim leader is also its only caucus member in the legislature or when no other caucus colleagues are competing for the leadership positions, will an interim leader stand as a candidate for permanent leadership.

An interim leader may, if necessary, lead the party into an election, but by Canadian custom, an election is usually not called while one of the parties is in a leadership race.

==Practice==
In most circumstances, a leader who has decided to step down gives extended notice, and a leadership convention is organized to choose their successor. The outgoing leader remains in the position for the duration of the leadership campaign, and then hands over power to the successor shortly after the convention.

However, sudden vacancies may occur for a variety of reasons.

===Death in office===
Wilfrid Laurier died in 1919, while holding the leadership of the Liberal Party. Daniel Duncan McKenzie was selected as the party&#x27;s interim leader, serving until William Lyon Mackenzie King was selected as the party&#x27;s leader later in the year.

Jack Layton initially took a leave of absence from the leadership of the New Democratic Party in 2011 for cancer treatment, and Nycole Turmel was named the interim leader of the party; Layton died before his intended date of return to office, and Turmel continued as interim leader pending the results of the 2012 leadership election.

===Scandal===
Glen Clark was forced to resign the leadership of the British Columbia New Democratic Party, and the premiership, after a criminal investigation against him was announced. He was succeeded by Dan Miller, who served until Ujjal Dosanjh won the resulting leadership convention.

===Creation of a new party===
In 2000, after the Reform Party was folded into the new Canadian Alliance, Deborah Grey served as the party&#x27;s interim leader until the party&#x27;s first leadership convention selected Stockwell Day. Similarly, after the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged in 2003, Senator John Lynch-Staunton was named interim leader of the new Conservative Party until the first leadership convention selected Stephen Harper.

===Internal dissension===
In 1983, Joe Clark received only 66.9 per cent support in an internal leadership review process conducted by the Progressive Conservative Party. Feeling that he did not have sufficiently strong support within the party, he thus scheduled a leadership convention. Initially, he remained the party&#x27;s leader in the meantime — however, as he was also standing as a candidate in the leadership process, he eventually stepped down and Erik Nielsen was installed as the party&#x27;s interim leader.

In early 2002, Stockwell Day&#x27;s leadership of the Canadian Alliance came under criticism due to party infighting. Like Clark, he thus announced a new leadership campaign in which he would reoffer as a candidate, and John Reynolds became the party&#x27;s interim leader.

===Leader defeated in an election===
In several cases, a party&#x27;s leader has been defeated in his or her own riding in an election, and has resigned soon afterward. A resignation is not necessarily required in such a scenario, as other leaders in the same situation have retained the leadership until they were able to run in a by-election. However, for personal or political reasons some leaders have opted to immediately resign the leadership instead.

Andy Brandt became interim leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party following the party&#x27;s defeat in the 1987 provincial election, in which leader Larry Grossman lost his own seat. He served until 1990, when he was succeeded by Mike Harris following a leadership convention.

Jean Charest became interim leader of the federal Progressive Conservatives following the party&#x27;s defeat in the 1993 election, in which Kim Campbell lost her own seat. At the next leadership convention in 1995, Charest was acclaimed to the full leadership of the party. Additionally, having subsequently become leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, Charest resigned as leader following the party&#x27;s defeat in the 2012 provincial election, in which he lost his seat. As a result, Jean-Marc Fournier was named interim leader.

Joy MacPhail served as interim leader of the New Democratic Party of British Columbia from 2001 to 2003, following the party&#x27;s defeat in the 2001 provincial election, in which Ujjal Dosanjh lost his seat. She served until Carole James was selected as the party&#x27;s new leader in 2003.

John Tory was defeated in the 2007 Ontario election, in which he ran in a different seat than the one where he was an incumbent. He stayed on as leader, despite facing some internal criticism — notably, a leadership review in 2008 gave him just 66.9 per cent support, the very same result which Joe Clark had deemed &quot;not&quot; sufficient to justify staying on as leader of the federal Progressive Conservatives in 1983. Bob Runciman served as interim parliamentary leader, but Tory retained the actual leadership of the party. Tory eventually resigned in 2009, after losing a by-election in Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock, and Runciman became the party&#x27;s interim leader.

Bob Rae was named interim leader of the Liberal Party following the 2011 election, in which his party&#x27;s previous leader, Michael Ignatieff, was defeated in his own riding.

===Internal disorganization===
In one case, Ontario Liberal Party interim leader W.E.N. Sinclair led his party through two consecutive elections in 1926 and 1929. He was interim leader from 1923 to 1930 since, due to the party&#x27;s state of disorganization, there was no leadership convention held in that period to choose a successor to Wellington Hay. When a convention was finally held, Sinclair drew little support and withdrew before balloting began. He was succeeded by future Premier Mitchell Hepburn.

===Leader accepts another position===

Sometimes an outgoing leader decides to resign immediately in order to ensure party unity, because they have accepted an appointment or chosen to stand as a candidate for (or been elected to) another position.

Following the resignation of Daniel Johnson as leader of the Quebec Liberal Party in 1998, the prospect of Jean Charest becoming the party&#x27;s new leader began to attract widespread public support. When Charest subsequently decided to stand as a candidate, he resigned as leader of the federal Progressive Conservatives, and Elsie Wayne became the party&#x27;s interim leader.

Similarly, Thomas Kennedy served as interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario from 1948 to 1949, after George Drew resigned to contest the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservatives.

===Leave of absence===
From November 1954 to February 1955 William Earl Rowe acted as interim Leader of the Opposition when Progressive Conservative leader George A. Drew was in poor health following an attack of meningitis. Drew returned but later fell ill again, and Rowe again became as interim leader of the opposition in August 1956. Drew resigned in September and Rowe became interim party and opposition leader until December, when John Diefenbaker was elected party leader.

An interim leader, Nycole Turmel was appointed to lead the NDP on July 28, 2011, while Jack Layton was on a medical leave of absence to fight cancer. She continued in the position following Layton&#x27;s death on August 22, 2011.

===Political circumstances===
Following the 2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute, Stéphane Dion&#x27;s continued leadership of the federal Liberals was felt to be an impediment to the party&#x27;s popular support, but with a situation where the party had to be almost immediately prepared to either take over the government or face an election, many party members felt that the party did not have the time to go through a conventional leadership race. After some internal debate, leadership candidates Dominic LeBlanc and Bob Rae withdrew from the race, and the only remaining candidate, Michael Ignatieff, was immediately named interim leader. His leadership was formally ratified at a party convention in May 2009.

===Personal circumstances===
Pam Barrett resigned the leadership of the Alberta New Democrats in 2000, but for health reasons she opted not to retain the leadership until her successor could be chosen, instead announcing that her resignation was effective immediately. Raj Pannu was named interim leader, and was then acclaimed leader at the subsequent convention. Brian Mason, who succeeded Pannu to the leadership in 2004, also took the position of interim leader before securing the full leadership at convention.

Danny Williams resigned the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador, similarly choosing to step down immediately rather than serving until a leadership convention, and Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale was elevated to the interim leadership of the party and to the premiership.

==Interim parliamentary leaders==
In certain circumstances, a party may also have an interim parliamentary leader who is &quot;not&quot; officially the party&#x27;s leader, particularly when the party leader is not a sitting member of the legislature. Herb Gray served as parliamentary leader of the Liberals following the selection of Jean Chrétien as leader in 1990, until Chrétien could run in a by-election to enter the House of Commons. Similarly, Bob Runciman served as parliamentary leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party following the 2007 election, in which party leader John Tory lost his seat in the legislature. He became the party&#x27;s full interim leader in 2009 after Tory was defeated in an attempt to re-enter the Legislative Assembly in a by-election.

Bill Graham served as interim parliamentary leader of the Liberals in early 2006, while outgoing party leader Paul Martin was still sitting as an MP and retained the formal leadership of the party. After this situation created some media confusion over which man would lead the party into an election if one were to occur, Martin stepped down as party leader in March, and Graham assumed the full interim leadership until Stéphane Dion was selected as leader in December.

Louis Plamondon became interim parliamentary leader of the Bloc Québécois on June 2, 2011, at the beginning of the first session of the 41st Canadian Parliament, following the 2011 federal election and the defeat and resignation of BQ leader Gilles Duceppe, while Vivian Barbot succeeded Duceppe as interim president of the BQ.

Major James Coldwell became parliamentary leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in October 1940, following the stroke and incapacitation of party leader J. S. Woodsworth, who retained the title of &quot;honorary president&quot; (leader). Coldwell was officially elected leader in July 1942, several months following Woodsworth&#x27;s death.

<text>Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas (, 1932 – 2010) was a Lithuanian politician who served as the fourth president of Lithuania from 1993 to 1998. He also served as the prime minister of Lithuania from 2001 to 2006. Brazauskas was the first democratically elected president of post-Soviet Lithuania.

He also served as head of the Communist Party of Lithuania that broke with Moscow.

==Biography==
Brazauskas was born in Rokiškis, Lithuania. Brazauskas traces his family back to the 18th century. In the village of Mikailiškii (now Radviliškis District Municipality). His father was Kazimieras Brazauskas (1906–1997) and mother was Sofija Perezilevičiūtė-Brazauskienė (1904–1979). He finished Kaišiadorys High School in 1952 and graduated from Kaunas Polytechnic Institute in 1956 with a degree in civil engineering. He later served as a Conscript sailor in the Soviet Navy, serving as a Fire controlman on board the Riga-class frigate &quot;Rosomacha&quot; until 1960. In 1967, Brazauskas started working in the Governmental Planning Committee, as a Committee&#x27;s head&#x27;s assistant. In 1974, Brazauskas received a PhD in economics.

He divorced his first wife, Julia, with whom he had two daughters; he married Kristina Butrimienė in 2002.

==Political career==
===In the Lithuanian SSR and early independent Lithuania===
Brazauskas held various positions in the government of Lithuanian SSR and Communist Party of Lithuania from 1965 onwards:
* 1965–1967, the minister of construction materials industry of Lithuanian SSR
* 1967–1977, deputy chairman of State Planning Committee of Lithuanian SSR.
* 1977–1987, secretary of Central Committee of Communist Party of Lithuania.
In the 1980s, he transformed himself from a Communist Party apparatchik to a moderate reformer. He was seen as cautious by nature, and when confronted by the tide of nationalist feeling in the Soviet Union, Brazauskas initially believed that the USSR might be reconstituted as a looser federation of independent, but communist, states. In seeing the tide of an independent democracy, he joined the reformist cause observing in 1990 that &quot;We are realists now, and we cannot be propagating any utopian ideas. It&#x27;s no secret [that] the Communist Party has a dirty history.&quot;

In 1988, he became the first secretary of the Communist Party of Lithuania. Under his leadership, the majority of the Communist Party of Lithuania supported the Lithuanian independence movement, broke away from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and transformed itself into social-democratic Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (now merged into the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party). Brazauskas was Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (head of state) from 15 January until 11 March 1990.

Though he sought to avoid a breach with Moscow in 1989, as leader of Lithuania&#x27;s Communist Party, he formally severed the party&#x27;s links with Moscow. This was rare in that no other local communist party organizations in the former Soviet Union dared to take this step. Some historians and journalists have later suggested that this act was the earliest certain indication of the inevitability of the demise of the Soviet Union.

After the 1992 parliamentary elections, the first since 1938, he became speaker of parliamentary and acting President of Lithuania on 25 November 1992. He then won the presidential election in a single round with 60 percent of the vote and was confirmed as president on 25 February 1993. He immediately suspended his membership in the Democratic Labour Party; the Constitution does not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his tenure.

===President of Lithuania===
Political scientist and diplomat Laimonas Tallat-Kelpša described Brazauskas&#x27;s presidency as an &quot;ambusher regime&quot;. Though he was elected with the backing of his political party, the Democratic Labour Party, he attempted to stay within the limitations of constitutional powers and avoid direct intervention in politics - except in moments of crisis, when he would &quot;leave his ambush&quot; and demand actions from the elected government.

He proposed Democratic Labour Party politician Adolfas Šleževičius as Prime Minister, who formed the Šleževičius Cabinet, but avoided interference in cabinet choices and allowed Šleževičius to form his cabinet. By 1994, the president&#x27;s relations with his party&#x27;s cabinet had turned cold, and Brazauskas stated that he &quot;could not agree [with him] on the simplest things&quot;. In late 1995, Šleževičius entered a scandal regarding his actions during the collapse of the Lithuanian bank &quot;Lietuvos akcinis inovacinis bankas&quot; - the prime minister withdrew his assets from the bank a day before it stopped its activities. After the Democratic Labour Party&#x27;s central committee expressed their continued confidence in him, Brazauskas suddenly demanded his resignation, which prompted parts of the LDDP, alongside the opposition, to force him to resign after a vote of no confidence.

Brazauskas supported Lithuania&#x27;s accession to NATO and the European Union, though he was initially sceptical towards the United States and membership in NATO, and described Homeland Union proposals of demanding reparations from Russia to be &quot;the politics of a hunched hedgehog&quot;. He supported pragmatic relations with Russia. However, he played an important part in the early 1993 diplomatic crisis with Russia, in which Russia suspended negotiations on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuania. After a personal phone call with Boris Yeltsin, negotiations were renewed and the withdrawal was completed.

In 1995, speaking before the Knesset, Brazauskas officially apologized for the Lithuanian people&#x27;s actions during the Holocaust.

In spite of high approval ratings, he decided not to seek reelection, and handed the presidency to his successor, Valdas Adamkus, on 25 February 1998.

===Retirement and return to politics===
Brazauskas said he planned to retire from politics and wanted to be &quot;an ordinary pensioner.&quot; During the first two years in retirement he wrote a book, though it was incomplete. He said he would continue writing it after his second stint in government. He also said he would finish &quot;household work&quot; and that he likes physical work. He added that &quot;I have no estates, but the property I own needs to be put in good order.&quot; He wanted to live &quot;in a way that other people live.&quot;

He subsequently returned to politics saying he &quot;always had something to do in life.&quot; He was Prime Minister from 3 July 2001, appointed by the parliament, until 1 June 2006, when his government resigned as President Valdas Adamkus expressed no confidence in two of the ministers, former Labour Party colleagues of Brazauskas, over ethical principles.

His government resigned on 2006 after the Labour Party left the governing coalition. Brazauskas decided not to remain in office as acting Prime Minister, and announced that he was finally retiring from politics. He said &quot;I tried to be a pensioner for several years, and I think I was successful. I hope for success this time, as well.&quot;

He led the ruling Social Democratic Party of Lithuania for one more year, until 2007, when he passed the reins to Gediminas Kirkilas. He served as the honorary chairman of the party, and remained an influential voice in party politics.

==Honours==
Algirdas Brazauskas was honored with the various decorations, among others the Order of Vytautas the Great with the Golden Chain, Grand Cross Order of Vytautas the Great. Days before his death Russian President Dmitry Medvedev awarded Brazauskas with the Order of Honour for his significant contribution to cooperation between Russia and Lithuania and good neighborly relations. Brazauskas was also an honorary member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

==Illness and death==

Brazauskas was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer in December 2008. He died on 26 June 2010 from cancer, aged 77. At the time of his death, he was still considered an influential figure in Lithuanian politics.

Following his death the obituaries wrote of him that he had a &quot;frame to match his indefatigable stature and a calm but commanding presence that could fill any stage.&quot; His successor as president, Valdas Adamkus, said that he &quot;dared to decide which side to choose in a critical moment.&quot;

Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė said &quot;The memory of the first directly elected president of Lithuania after it restored its independence, of a strong and charismatic personality, will remain for a long time in the hearts of the Lithuanian people.&quot;

<doc id="394998" wikidata="Q80561" url="?curid=394998" title="Antakya">
<text>Antakya (), modern form of Antioch, is a municipality and the capital district of Hatay Province, Turkey. Its area is . Prior to the devastating 2023 earthquakes, its population was recorded at 399,045 (2022). It is in the Hatay Province, which is the southernmost region of Turkey. The city is located in a well-watered and fertile valley on the Orontes River, about from the Levantine Sea.

Today&#x27;s city stands partly on the site of the ancient Antiochia (also known as &quot;Antioch on the Orontes&quot;), which was founded in the fourth century BC by the Seleucid Empire. Antioch later became one of the Roman Empire&#x27;s largest cities and was made the capital of the provinces of Syria and Coele-Syria. It was also an influential early center of Christianity; the New Testament asserts that the name &quot;Christian&quot; first emerged in Antioch. The city gained much ecclesiastical importance during the times of the Byzantine Empire. Captured by Umar ibn al-Khattab in the seventh century AD, the medieval Antakiyah was conquered or re-conquered several times: by the Byzantines in 969, the Seljuks in 1084, the Crusaders in 1098, the Mamluks in 1268, and eventually the Ottomans in 1517, who would integrate it to the Aleppo Eyalet then to the Aleppo Vilayet. The city joined the Hatay State under the French Mandate before joining the Turkish Republic.

On 6 February 2023, the city was heavily damaged by two powerful earthquakes with their epicenter in Kahramanmaraş. Some of the historical sites, including the Church of St Paul, were destroyed. The earthquakes destroyed several neighborhoods in the city and left thousands homeless. The death toll in Hatay Province, which includes Antakya, was estimated at over 20,000.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

Humans have occupied the area of Antioch since the Chalcolithic (6th millennium BCE), as revealed by archaeological excavations of Alalakh, among others.

The Macedonian King Alexander the Great, after defeating the Achaemenid Empire in the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, followed the Orontes south into Syria and occupied the area. The city of Antioch was founded in 300 BC, after the death of Alexander, by the Seleucid emperor Seleucus I Nicator. It played an important role as one of the largest cities in the Seleucid, Roman, and Byzantine empires. The city swapped hands between the Romans and the Sasanian Empire in the 3rd century. It was the battleground for the siege of Antioch (253) when Shapur I defeated the Roman army and the later Battle of Antioch (613) where the Persians were successful at capturing the city for the last time. It was a key city during the early history of Christianity, in particular that of the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Antiochian Orthodox Church and the Maronite Church, as well as during the spread of Islam and the Crusades.

=== Biblical era ===
From &quot;The Acts of the Apostles&quot;, Chapter 11 Verse 26.

&quot;&quot;And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch&quot;.&quot;

=== Rashidun period ===
In 637, during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, Antioch was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate during the Battle of the Iron Bridge. The city became known in Arabic as (). Since the Umayyad Caliphate was unable to penetrate the Anatolian plateau, Antioch found itself on the frontline of the conflicts between two hostile empires during the next 350 years, so that the city went into a precipitous decline. After the demise of Umayyad rule, Antioch became part of the Abbasid empire (except for a brief rule of the Tulunids), Ikhshidids and Hamdanids.

In 969, the city was reconquered for the Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas by Michael Bourtzes and the &quot;stratopedarches&quot; Peter. It soon became the seat of a &quot;dux&quot;, who commanded the forces of the local themes and was the most important officer on the Empire&#x27;s eastern border, held by such men as Nikephoros Ouranos. In 1078, Philaretos Brachamios, an Armenian hero, seized power. He held the city until the Seljuk Turks captured it from him in 1084. The Sultanate of Rum held it only fourteen years before the Crusaders arrived.

=== Crusader era ===


The Crusaders&#x27; Siege of Antioch between October 1097 and June 1098 during the First Crusade resulted in its fall. The Crusaders caused significant damage, including a massacre of its population, both Christian and Muslim. Following the defeat of Seljuk forces arriving with the aim to break the siege only four days after its capture by the crusaders, Bohemond I became its overlord. It remained the capital of the Latin Principality of Antioch for nearly two centuries.

In 1268 it fell to the Egyptian Mamluk Sultan Baybars after another siege. Baibars proceeded to massacre the Christian population. In addition to suffering the ravages of war, the city lost its commercial importance because trade routes to East Asia moved north following the 13th century Mongol conquests. Antioch never recovered as a major city, with much of its former role falling to the port city of Alexandretta (&quot;İskenderun&quot;). An account of both cities as they were in 1675 appears in the diary of the English naval chaplain Henry Teonge.

=== Ottoman city ===

The city was initially the centre of the Sanjak of Antakya, part of the Damascus Eyalet. It was laterly centre of Sanjak of Antakya in Aleppo Eyalet. It was finally kaza centre in Sanjak of Aleppo, part of Aleppo Vilayet.

In 1822 (and again in 1872), Antakya was hit by an earthquake and damaged. When Egyptian general Ibrahim Pasha established his headquarters in the city in 1835, it had only some 5,000 inhabitants. Supporters hoped the city might develop thanks to the Euphrates Valley Railway, which was supposed to link it to the port of Sueida (now Samandağı), but this plan never came to fruition. This scheme is the subject of Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poem (1836) in which she reflects of the superiority of trade and commerce over war and conflict. The city suffered repeated outbreaks of cholera due to inadequate infrastructure for sanitation. Later the city developed and rapidly resumed much of its old importance when a railway was built along the lower Orontes Valley.

=== French Mandate and Turkish annexation ===
Antioch was part of the Sanjak of Alexandretta during the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, until it was made the Hatay State in 1938, after Turkish pressure. An Arab nationalist newspaper in the city, run by Zaki al-Arsuzi, was shut down by the Turks. On 30 May 1938, an Arab was killed during a riot by a Turkish crowd. On 7 July 1938, the Turkish army entered Antioch. The annexation of the Hatay State by Turkey in 1939, creating the Hatay Province, caused an exodus of Christians and Alawites from Antioch east to the French Mandate.

The district Antakya was created in 2013 from part of the former central district of Hatay.

== Demographics ==
=== Language ===
A British traveller visiting Antakya in 1798 reported that generally, Turkish was spoken, while, by contrast, the prevalent language in Aleppo at the time was Arabic. Most Alawites and Armenians spoke Turkish as a second language.

=== Religion ===
In 1935, Turkish and Arab Muslims made more than 80% of the population.
Antakya was home to one of the most ancient Jewish communities for over 2200 years.

== Recent history ==


Mount Habib-i Neccar and the city walls which climb the hillsides symbolise Antakya, making the city a formidable fortress built on a series of hills running north-east to south-west. Antakya was originally centred on the east bank of the river. Since the 19th century, the city has expanded with new neighbourhoods built on the plains across the river to the south-west, and four bridges connect the old and new cities. Many of the buildings of the last two decades are styled as concrete blocks, and Antakya has lost much of its classic beauty. The narrow streets of the old city can become clogged with traffic.

Antakya is a provincial capital of considerable importance as the centre of a large district. The draining of Lake Amik and development of land have caused the region&#x27;s economy to grow in wealth and productivity. The town is a lively shopping and business centre with many restaurants, cinemas and other amenities. This district is centred on a large park opposite the governor&#x27;s building and the central avenue &quot;Kurtuluş Caddesı&quot;. The tea gardens, cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood of &quot;Harbiye&quot; are popular destinations, particularly for the variety of &quot;meze&quot; in the restaurants. The Orontes River can be malodorous when water is low in summer. Rather than formal nightlife, in the summer heat, people will stay outside until late at the night to walk with their families and friends, and munch on snacks.

Its location near the Syrian border makes Antakya more cosmopolitan than many cities in Turkey. It did not attract the mass immigration of people from eastern Anatolia in the 1980s and 1990s that radically swelled the populations of Mediterranean cities such as Adana and Mersin. Both Turkish and Arabic are still widely spoken in Antakya, although written Arabic is rarely used. A mixed community of faiths and denominations co-exist peacefully here. While almost all the inhabitants are Sunni Muslim, a substantial proportion adhere to the Alevi and Alawite traditions of Islam, in &quot;Harbiye&quot; there is a place to honour the saint Hızır. Numerous tombs of saints, of both Sunni and Alawite, are located throughout the city. Several small Christian communities are active in the city, with the largest church being St. Peter and St. Paul on Hürriyet Avenue. With its long history of spiritual and religious movements, Antakya is a place of pilgrimage for Christians. The Jewish community of Antakya had shrunk to 14 members in 2014. In 2023, the last Jew in the city announced that he was leaving the city after a devastating earthquake.

It has a reputation in Turkey as a place for spells, fortune telling, miracles and spirits.
Local crafts include a soap scented with the oil of bay tree.

=== 2023 earthquakes ===

On 6 February 2023, Antakya suffered heavy damage as a result of a major earthquake. Many parts of the city were totally destroyed. As of 7 February, the BBC reported that at least 1,200 buildings in the city center and the districts of Kırıkhan and İskenderun were razed. Officials said &quot;almost all&quot; houses in the Cebrail District had collapsed. Many historical sites, including churches and mosques, were destroyed, St. Paul&#x27;s Church being one of them. The historic Antakya Synagogue and Hatay State Assembly Building were also destroyed.

In the aftermath, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan promised to an immediate reconstruction of the affected areas. During a visit to the city in September 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that heavily damaged buildings were still being demolished and no large-scale reconstruction works were observed. Many damaged buildings remained standing but abandoned while survivors continue to live in tents. Hatay&#x27;s mayor, Lütfü Savaş, said only half of the estimated 38,000 buildings registered to be dismantled had been fulfilled. In Gülderen, there were ongoing works to build 2,300 apartment units in 122 blocks.

== Geography ==
Antakya is located on the banks of the Orontes River (), approximately inland from the Mediterranean coast. The city is in a valley surrounded by mountains, the Nur Mountains (ancient Amanos) to the northwest and Mount Keldağ (Jebel Akra) to the south, with the 440 m high Mount Habib-i Neccar (the ancient Mount Silpius) forming its eastern limits. The mountains are a source of a green marble. Antakya is at the northern edge of the Dead Sea Rift and vulnerable to earthquakes.

The plain of Amik to the north-east of the city is fertile soil watered by the Orontes, the Karasu and the Afrin rivers; the lake in the plain was drained in 1980 by a French company. At the same time channels were built to widen the Orontes and let it pass neatly through the city centre. The Orontes is joined in Antakya by the Hacı Kürüş stream to the north-east of the city near the church of St Peter, and the Hamşen which runs down from Habib-i Neccar to the south-west, under Memekli Bridge near the army barracks. Flora includes the bay trees and myrtle.

== Main sights ==

The long and varied history has created many architectural sites of interest. There is much for visitors to see in Antakya, although many buildings have been lost in the rapid growth and redevelopment of the city in recent decades:
* Hatay Archaeology Museum has the second largest collection of Roman mosaics in the world;
* The rock-carved &quot;Church of St Peter&quot;, with its network of refuges and tunnels carved out of the rock, a site of Christian pilgrimage. There are also tombs cut into the rock face at various places along the Orontes valley;

* The panoramic view of the city from the heights of Mount Habib-i Neccar;
* St. Paul Orthodox Church.

With its rich architectural heritage, Antakya is a member of the Norwich-based European Association of Historic Towns and Regions. The Roman bridge (thought to date from the era of Diocletian) was destroyed in 1972 during the widening and channelling of the Orontes.

== Cuisine ==
The cuisine of Antakya is renowned. Its cuisine is considered Levantine rather than Turkish. The cuisine offers plenty of meals, where beef and lamb are mainly used. Popular dishes include the typical Turkish &quot;kebab&quot;, served with spices and onions in flat unleavened bread, with yoghurt as &quot;ali nazik&quot; kebab, oruk, kaytaz böreği and katıklı ekmek. Hot, spicy food is a feature of this part of Turkey, along with Turkish coffee and local specialties.

Here are some savoury foods:

* &quot;Müşebbek&quot; - rings of deep fried pastry;
* &quot;Peynirli irmik helvası&quot; - Peynirli İrmik Helvası is a dessert that is made of semolina, sugar and traditional cheese that is the same as used in künefe. It is served warm, especially in restaurants in the region Harbiye, rather than künefe shops that are located in the centre.

<text>Jacques Hugues Sylla (22 July 1946 – 26 December 2009) was a Malagasy politician. He was the Prime Minister of Madagascar under President Marc Ravalomanana from February 2002 to January 2007. He subsequently served as the President of the National Assembly of Madagascar from October 2007 to March 2009.

==Life and career==
Sylla was born on the island of Sainte-Marie, Analanjirofo, off the east coast of Madagascar. He was the son of Albert Sylla, who served as Foreign Minister under Madagascar&#x27;s first President, Philibert Tsiranana, until being killed in a plane crash in July 1967. He served as Foreign Minister himself from 1993 to 1996, under President Albert Zafy. He was an opponent of President Didier Ratsiraka and was one of the lawyers advising Marc Ravalomanana when he was elected Mayor of Antananarivo in 1999. Sylla was also a founder of the Toamasina section of the National Committee for the Observation of Elections.

Sylla backed Ravalomanana in the crisis that followed the December 2001 presidential election and argued Ravalomanana&#x27;s case before the High Constitutional Court. On February 26, 2002, in the midst of the crisis, Ravalomanana named Sylla as Prime Minister, a few days after Ravalomanana declared himself president. After Ravalomanana was sworn in for a second time in early May, Sylla was reappointed as Prime Minister on May 9.

Later in 2002, Sylla became the Secretary General of the ruling Tiako I Madagasikara (TIM) party; this marked the first time that he had ever been a member of a political party.

Sylla resigned as Prime Minister on 19 January 2007, at the end of Ravalomanana&#x27;s first term; his resignation was accepted by Ravalomanana, who appointed Charles Rabemananjara as Prime Minister on 20 January.

In the September 2007 parliamentary election, Sylla stood as a TIM candidate in the Sainte-Marie constituency, winning with 51.04% of the vote according to provisional results. When the new session of the National Assembly began, Sylla was elected as President of the National Assembly on October 23, 2007; he was the only candidate and received 123 votes from the 124 deputies present, with one blank vote.

As President of the National Assembly, Sylla was an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the national political bureau of TIM and therefore remained on the political bureau at TIM&#x27;s May 2008 congress.

Sylla was a Catholic, a Côtier, and had dual Malagasy and French nationality.

===Role in 2009 political crisis===
During the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, Sylla participated in negotiations between President Ravalomanana and opposition leader Andry Rajoelina on February 24, 2009. Subsequently, at an opposition rally on March 14, 2009, Sylla announced that he was joining the opposition and said that Ravalomanana should resign; according to Sylla, that was the only solution and &quot;as President of the National Assembly, I have to recognise reality.&quot;

Rajoelina appointed Sylla as President of the Transitional Congress on 8 September 2009; he also appointed a new government on the same date. He ostensibly did so in the spirit of the Maputo agreement between Malagasy political leaders, which called for the creation of a national unity government, but the opposition denounced Rajoelina&#x27;s appointments, and Sylla was considered to have completely broken with Ravalomanana.

Sylla died on 26 December 2009 at the age of 63 after a long illness.

<text>A wireless gateway routes packets from a wireless LAN to another network, wired or wireless WAN. It may be implemented as software or hardware or a combination of both. Wireless gateways combine the functions of a wireless access point, a router, and often provide firewall functions as well. They provide network address translation (NAT) functionality, so multiple users can use the internet with a single public IP. It also acts like a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to assign IPs automatically to devices connected to the network.

There are two kinds of wireless gateways. The simpler kind must be connected to a DSL modem or cable modem to connect to the internet via the internet service provider (ISP). The more complex kind has a built-in modem to connect to the internet without needing another device. This converged device saves desk space and simplifies wiring by replacing two electronic packages with one. It has a wired connection to the ISP, at least one jack port for the LAN (usually four jacks), and an antenna for wireless users. The wireless gateway could support wireless 802.11b and 802.11g with speed up to 56 Mbit/s, 802.11n with speed up to 300Mps and recently the 802.11ac with speed up to 1200 Mbit/s. The LAN interface may support 100 Mbit/s (Fast) or 1000 Mbit/s (Gigabit) Ethernet.

All wireless gateways have the ability to protect the wireless network using security encryption methods such as WEP, WPA, and WPS. WPA2 with WPS disabled is the most secure method. There are many wireless gateway brands with models offering different features and quality. They can differ on the wireless range and speed, a number of LAN ports, speed, and extra functionality. Some available brands in the market are Motorola, Netgear, and Linksys. However, most internet providers offer a free wireless gateway with their services, thus limiting the user&#x27;s choice. On the other hand, the device provided by the ISP has the advantage that it comes pre-configured and ready to be installed. Another advantage of using these devices is the ability of the company to troubleshoot and fix any problem via remote access, which is very convenient for most users.

<text>Ahmed Mohamed ag Hamani (born 1942) was the prime minister of Mali from 2002 to 2004.

==Life and career==
Hamani was born in Goundam, and is an ethnic Tuareg. He became a technical advisor to the Minister of Planning in 1975 before entering the government on January 7, 1978, as Minister for the Supervision of Companies and State Enterprises. He then became Minister of Information and Telecommunications in the government named on June 28, 1979 and Minister of Planning in the government named on August 2, 1980; in the latter position, he became the second ranking person in the government after Moussa Traoré, who was President and Minister of Defense. He subsequently became Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture on December 31, 1984, and then Minister of Transport and Public Works on June 6, 1986. He left the government on January 20, 1987 and became High Commissioner of the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River, in which post he remained until 1992. In 1993, he was named Ambassador to Morocco by President Alpha Oumar Konaré; after six years in that post, he became Ambassador to Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and the European Union.

He served there until he was named Prime Minister by Amadou Toumani Touré on June 9, 2002, after Touré took office following his victory in that year&#x27;s presidential election, and his government was named on June 14. His initial appointment was regarded as being on a temporary basis extending through the period of the July 2002 parliamentary election. After the election, he was reappointed on October 12, 2002, with a new government being named on October 16. At Touré&#x27;s request, he submitted his government&#x27;s resignation on April 28, 2004, and Ousmane Issoufi Maïga was appointed as Prime Minister on April 29.

<text>Estrées-Deniécourt (Picard: &quot;Étrée-Dgnincourt&quot;) is a commune in the Somme department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.

==Geography==
The commune lies on the national highway N29, at the junction with the A1 autoroute, west of the river Somme and east of Amiens. It has the remains of a Roman road, the &quot;Chaussée Brunehaut&quot; passing through the village.

==History==
It is one of many villages in the north of France bearing the name &quot;Estrées&quot;. The etymology of the name is from &quot;strata&quot; (cognate of English &quot;street&quot;), the word for the stone-layered Roman roads in the area (some of which turned into modern highways). Hence &quot;Estreti&quot;, &quot;village on the road&quot; which developed into &quot;Estrées&quot;.

It was the scene of heavy fighting during the Battle of the Somme. The probable (unmarked) burial site of Raynal Bolling, the first U.S. officer of high rank to fall in combat.

The Estrées-Deniécourt Military Cemetery, is located at the west end of the village and the German Cemetery is located on the way to the commune of Fay.

==Population==
==Miscellaneous==
The commune holds an annual &quot;brocante&quot; (flea-market) each June.

<doc id="395009" wikidata="Q152511" url="?curid=395009" title="Eddie Fenech Adami">
<text>Edoardo &quot;Eddie&quot; Fenech Adami (born 7 February 1934) is a Maltese and Nationalist politician who served as the prime minister of Malta from 1987 until 1996, and again from 1998 until 2004. Subsequently, he was the seventh president of Malta from 2004 to 2009. He led his party to win four general elections, in 1987, 1992, 1998 and 2003, as well as the majority of votes in 1981. Staunchly pro-European, Fenech Adami was fundamental for Malta&#x27;s accession to the European Union.

Originally a lawyer, Fenech Adami was co-opted Member of Parliament (MP) in 1969. He served in a number of senior party positions, including president of the Administrative and General Councils, and was elected to succeed Giorgio Borġ Olivier as party leader. From April 1977 onwards, Fenech Adami led the Nationalist opposition in a campaign of civil disobedience against the Mintoff and Mifsud Bonnici administrations of the late seventies and eighties, focusing on a message of respect for democratic principles and human rights.

Upon moving into Auberge de Castille in 1987, Fenech Adami began a policy of national reconciliation, initiating a series of political and economic reforms intended to open up the economy, reverse high unemployment and the islands&#x27; problems following sixteen years of socialist policies. His political ideology and economic policies highlighted deregulation, more flexible labour markets, the overhaul of the country&#x27;s physical infrastructure and the privatisation of state-owned companies. The legal and business structures were also overhauled and trade liberalised. The communications, financial services and banking sectors were deregulated or privatised. Malta also began a period of integration with the EU, formally applying for membership in 1990.

Fenech Adami was re-elected with a modest majority in 1992; his popularity, however, wavered during his second term of office amid further economic reforms, particularly the introduction of VAT, and the re-branding of the main opposition party with a new and more dynamic leader, Alfred Sant. Losing power in 1996, Fenech Adami was returned as prime minister within twenty-two months, after the Labour government&#x27;s decision to call a snap election backfired. Reversing the unpopular economic policies of the Labour Party, Fenech Adami reactivated Malta&#x27;s EU membership application and initiated further economic reforms.

He successfully led the pro-EU movement in the 2003 EU membership referendum campaign and won the successive election. He signed Malta&#x27;s Accession Treaty with the European Union and represented Malta in various EU Summits and Commonwealth meetings. 

Fenech Adami resigned as Leader of the Nationalist Party in February 2004, resigning his premiership and giving up his parliamentary seat in March 2004. He became the seventh President of Malta in April 2004.

==Education and professional career==
Edward (Edoardo) Fenech Adami was born in Birkirkara, British Malta, the son of Josephine Fenech Adami, née Pace, and Luigi Fenech Adami, a customs officer. The fourth boy in a family of five children, his early childhood was marked by the air raids and deprivation in Malta during the Second World War.

He began his education at St Aloysius&#x27; College in Birkirkara, continuing his studies there until sitting for his matriculation exams. He attended the Royal University of Malta, studying economics, classics, and then law. He was called to the bar in 1959, and started his career in the law courts. He was married to Mary née Sciberras, who died in 2011. The couple had five children – John, Beppe (a Nationalist MP), Michael (a Nationalist Local Councillor for Birkirkara), Maria and Luigi.

==Early political career==
Fenech Adami joined the Nationalist Party in the early sixties, first as a constituency official, then as president of the Administrative and General Councils, assistant secretary general, and editor of its newspaper &quot;Il-Poplu&quot; (English: &quot;The People&quot;). He contested two unsuccessful campaigns in 1962 and 1966, becoming a Member of Parliament in 1969 following a by-election for the newly vacant seat of Ġorġ Caruana. Prime Minister Borġ Olivier was instrumental in picking Fenech Adami for this co-option to Parliament.

Believing that the Borġ Olivier administration ought to seize the initiative, Fenech Adami pleaded with Borġ Olivier to reshuffle the cabinet, and call early elections in 1970 when the British were negotiating the renewal of the islands&#x27; financial and defence agreement. The Nationalist Party was returned to the Opposition in 1971, with the Party&#x27;s clubs being in the islands&#x27; villages and towns being vandalised or destroyed – a trend which continued right up to the late eighties. Fenech Adami served as spokesman for the Opposition on labour relations and social services. His political frailty peaked with his agreement with Mintoff to declare a Maltese republic in 1974, without consulting the electorate; at the time, Guido de Marco called this &quot;an unacceptable act of betrayal.&quot; Borġ Olivier&#x27;s growing weakness led to a successive electoral defeat in 1976. Fenech Adami resisted strongly the Party&#x27;s proposal to abolish income tax as not being credible. Ultimately, the loss of two successive elections brought about Borġ Olivier&#x27;s downfall and opened up the Nationalist Party for the choice of a new leader, and modernisation. This only happened following a 1977 Opposition parliamentary group meeting in de Marco&#x27;s Ħamrun home, which forced Borġ Olivier to accept a designate-leader in his stead.

==Leader of the Nationalist Party==
A relative newcomer to the Party, Fenech Adami contested the party leadership election against two other established MPs, Ċensu Tabone and de Marco in 1977. Fenech Adami swept the leadership contest in April 1977 with a two-thirds majority; upon his election, Fenech Adami chose to keep his two contenders in highly visible roles. Taking the lead from Borġ Olivier in 1978, Fenech Adami immediately set out to reform the Nationalist Party, adapting to the needs of a more socially aware electorate. This modernisation process attracted a new, and younger party membership.

On 15 October 1979, following hearsay about an attempt on the life of Dom Mintoff, a large group of thugs attacked and burnt down the premises and printing presses of the independent conservative newspaper, &quot;The Times of Malta.&quot;&quot; &quot;The thugs proceeded to ransack various Nationalist Party clubs and the private residence of Fenech Adami in Birkirkara.&quot; &quot; Fenech Adami&#x27;s neighbours locked themselves in their homes as soon as they heard the commotion. Approaching her house from mass, Mary Fenech Adami was shocked at the mayhem: the front door was wide open, with ten men inside ransacking valuables and stealing heirlooms, smashing glass doors and shutters, hurling books and furniture outside onto the street. The thugs had wooden clubs, which appeared to be solid sawn-off table legs. The six rooms forming the ground floor of the Fenech Adami residence were completely wrecked. Mary Fenech Adami was attacked and slammed against a wall. Her earrings were ripped off, and she was punched on her chest and face. She was then kicked and pushed onto the street. Mary Fenech Adami, her four sons and her mother-in-law only escaped by going up to the third storey of their house and jumping onto a neighbour&#x27;s house. These incidents marked an escalation of violence in the islands, and came to be known as &quot;Black Monday&quot;. The attack consolidated Fenech Adami&#x27;s leadership, with a mass meeting held outside Fenech Adami&#x27;s residence attracting one of the largest crowds ever, signalling the changing mood in the country.

The Nationalist Party&#x27;s support grew enough to attract the majority of votes in the controversial 1981 elections, but failed to gain a majority of seats. This was caused by heavily gerrymandered districts, which ensured Labour would retain the Constitutionally required majority of seats in Parliament. The election led to years of bitter struggles against an entrenched Labour government. Fenech Adami led a successful campaign of civil disobedience, boycotting Parliament repeatedly from 1981 to 1983. An upsurge in political violence against the Nationalist Party began, with Fenech Adami pushing for democratic renewal in the nation. The Nationalist Party instructed supporters to boycott government-friendly businesses, bringing prominent Labour supporters to their knees thus forcing Labour to acknowledge the anomalous situation. In March 1983, the Nationalist opposition returned to their seats in Parliament on the basis of starting negotiations to enact constitutional amendments to prevent perverse results in future general elections.

On 30 November 1986, Nationalist Party supporters gathered on the Tal-Barrani road to walk towards Żejtun, where Fenech Adami was to address a mass meeting. This was only allowed after the Party challenged its right to do so in the Constitutional Court. The crowd found that the road to Żejtun was blocked by boulders, poles and burning tyres. A group of Labour supporters, some wearing balaclavas, began to assault the crowd. The situation precipitated with the arrival on site of the police&#x27;s Special Mobile Unit, which fired tear-gas canisters and rubber bullets on the Nationalist Party supporters. Twenty-three people were injured, with many treated at an improvised emergency clinic at the Party headquarters in Tal-Pietà. This incident was followed a month later by the murder of Raymond Caruana, who was killed by a stray bullet fired through the door of a Nationalist Party club in Gudja by unknown Labour activists. In Parliament, Fenech Adami used his allotted Budget reply to denounce the crime, and the subsequent arrest of Pietru Pawl Busuttil, who was a Nationalist Party activist framed for the murder by the police. Fenech Adami held that the Budget was irrelevant for the Maltese people, in that the defence of liberty and democracy is what the Maltese people shall vote for. The parliamentary session and Fenech Adami&#x27;s speech were interrupted by animated Labour MPs, led by ministers Wistin Abela and Lorry Sant, who almost assault him.

==Prime Minister (1987–1996)==
Following a set of constitutional changes, the party winning an absolute majority of votes would be guaranteed a parliamentary majority. In 1987, following a two-month-long campaign and thousands of workers employed with governmental agencies, parastatal and state-owned enterprises, the Nationalist Party won the general elections with a majority of 5,000 votes.

Between 1987 and 1992, Fenech Adami ushered a major period of change in Malta. Foreign relations were expanded, with Malta starting its transition towards a modern European democracy. Under Fenech Adami, the islands steered a more pro-Western course. Malta maintained its economic and political ties with Libya, diplomatic ties it built under the socialist administration, but the friendship treaty between the two countries was renegotiated. Fenech Adami widened Malta&#x27;s political distance with Gaddafi, eliminating military obligations on both sides. Fenech Adami also severed Malta&#x27;s air links with Libya, and honoured the UN embargo on the country.

The country&#x27;s physical infrastructure was completely overhauled, with many roads reconstructed, a new airport, reverse osmosis plants and power station built, as well as the removal of import licenses and quotas. Telecommunications, financial services and the banking sectors were deregulated or privatised. By the early nineties, Fenech Adami started to direct his economic and governmental policies to integrate Malta into the European Economic Community. This included the gradual removal of local import and customs duties. As prime minister he asked for a number of presidential pardons including one for Joseph Fenech, who was a well known criminal. The pardon was proffered on the basis of Joseph Fenech acting as a star witness in a trial for the attempted murder of Richard Cachia Caruana, then personal assistant to prime minister Fenech Adami.

Fenech Adami was reconfirmed as Prime Minister in the February 1992 elections, with a modest majority. The gradual decrease in income taxes, and the reduction in levies on trade with EEC countries led to a worrying decrease in government revenues. In order to ensure sustainable public finances, the Nationalist government introduced a value-added tax (VAT) to counterbalance the loss in tariff income. VAT proved to be very unpopular, with the new leader of the Labour Party, Alfred Sant, riding a wave of popular dissatisfaction at the pace and depth of the reforms intended to allow Malta to join the European Union. Disgruntled businesses, vocal minority groups (such as hunters and trappers) and the newly found dynamism of the Labour Party led to the loss of the 1996 general elections, with the Nationalist Party gaining only 47.8% of cast votes.

==Leader of the Opposition (1996–1998) ==

Between 1996 and 1998, Fenech Adami served as Leader of the Opposition. The Labour government held a one-seat majority, which led to a period of severe political instability. Labour introduced several economic policies, fulfilling its pledge to remove VAT by replacing it with a complex customs and excise tax system (CET), the introduction of further taxes to counter the shortfall in revenues, and increased utility bills. The delicate situation, which saw the resignation of the finance minister, and other prominent members of the party and government, was further complicated with the actions of Dom Mintoff.

The latter, who was a backbencher in the Sant government, rose against his own government. Unable to contain Mintoff&#x27;s protests against the austere 1997 Budget, and a waterfront redevelopment project in Cottonera, the Labour government called snap elections. Fenech Adami reclaimed the floating vote, winning a 13,000 vote majority, with his Party returned to office in September 1998.

==Prime Minister (1998–2004)==

Malta&#x27;s European Union application, which was put on hold by the previous Labour government, was reactivated and negotiations were concluded by December 2002. Fenech Adami successfully led the pro-EU movement in the 2003 EU membership referendum campaign, and won the successive election. He signed Malta&#x27;s Accession Treaty with the European Union on 16 April 2003, and represented Malta in various EU Summits and Commonwealth meetings. In December 2003, he received the European of the Year 2003 Award from the influential Brussels-based newspaper &quot;European Voice&quot; in recognition of his unfaltering efforts to bring Malta into the European Union. Fenech Adami resigned as Leader of the Nationalist Party in February 2004, resigning his premiership and giving up his parliamentary seat on 23 March 2004, thus becoming the longest serving Prime Minister since Malta&#x27;s independence.

==President of Malta==
Following his resignation as Prime Minister, Fenech Adami was appointed President of Malta on 4 April 2004. He served a five-year term, leaving office on 4 April 2009, when he was succeeded by George Abela.

<doc id="395019" wikidata="Q1740482" url="?curid=395019" title="Khaki election">
<text>In Westminster systems of government, a khaki election is any national election which is heavily influenced by wartime or postwar sentiment. In the British general election of 1900, the Conservative Party government of Lord Salisbury was returned to office, defeating a disunited Liberal Party. The reason for this name is that the election was held in the midst of the Second Boer War and khaki was the colour of the relatively new military uniform of the British Army that had been universally adopted in that war.

The term was later used to describe two later elections like the 1918 general election, fought at the end of World War I, which resulted in a huge victory for David Lloyd George&#x27;s wartime coalition government and the 1945 general election, held after the end of World War II in Europe and in the closing days of the Pacific War, where Labour Party leader Clement Attlee won by a landslide. Another such case is the 1983 general election in which the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher was elected into office despite its previous unpopularity, which was linked to the economic situation. The Falklands War, along with a divided opposition, ensured the next Conservative term in office.

The term is also applied to the 1917 Canadian federal election, which was held during World War I. By allowing servicemen and women related to servicemen to vote, Sir Robert Borden&#x27;s Unionist Party won a majority.

The term also has currency in Australia. In 2015, the Labor Party Opposition accused the Coalition federal government of attempting to manufacture a khaki election by emphasising terror and military action in response to the 2014 rise of violent Islamic extremism from the Islamic State terrorist group.

<text>Sghair Ould M&#x27;Bareck (; born 1954) is a Mauritanian politician. He was the 9th Prime Minister of Mauritania from July 6, 2003, when he was appointed by President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya following an attempted coup in the previous month, until August 7, 2005, when he resigned following a successful coup against Maaouya. Sghair is a Haratin. 

== Biography ==
Sghair, who was born in Néma, entered the government as Minister of National Education in April 1992. In 1993 he became Minister of Rural Development and the Environment, and in late 1995 he became Minister of Health and Social Affairs. He was Minister of National Education again from 1997 to 1998, then Minister of Trade, the Craft Industry and Tourism from 1998 to 1999. He became Minister of Equipment and Transport in late 1999, Minister of National Education again in 2000, and Minister of Justice in November 2001. 

He was then appointed as Prime Minister in July 2003. He replaced Cheikh El Avia Ould Mohamed Khouna, who came from the same part of eastern Mauritania as many of the accused 2003 coup plotters.

President Maaouya was deposed in a military coup on August 3, 2005. Although the coup leaders requested on the following day that Sghair and other Government ministers remain in their posts, on August 7 he and his government resigned and the coup leaders named a new Prime minister, Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar, who had previously held that office from 1992 to 1996. 

As of 2009, Sghair holds the post of Mediator of the Republic. He was one of four candidates standing in the June 2009 presidential election. He met with Interim President Ba Mamadou M&#x27;Bare in late April to submit a request for a two-month leave of absence in order to concentrate on his presidential candidacy.

<doc id="395021" wikidata="Q889228" url="?curid=395021" title="Think Tank (Blur album)">
<text>Think Tank is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Blur, released on 5 May 2003. Continuing the jam-based studio constructions of the group&#x27;s previous album, &quot;13&quot; (1999), the album expanded on the use of sampled rhythm loops and brooding, heavy electronic sounds. There are also heavy influences from dance music, hip hop, dub, jazz, and African music, an indication of songwriter Damon Albarn&#x27;s expanding musical interests.

Recording sessions started in November 2001, taking place in London, Morocco and Devon, and finished a year later. The album&#x27;s primary producer was Ben Hillier with additional production by Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim), and William Orbit. At the start of the sessions, guitarist Graham Coxon had been in rehab for alcoholism, so was not present. Initially unaware of how long Coxon would be in rehab for, Albarn, James and Rowntree decided to start work in the studio without Coxon.

After he re-joined, relationships between him and the other members became strained. After initial recording sessions, Coxon left, leaving little of his presence on the finished album. This is the only Blur album to not feature Coxon as a full-time member; he reunited with Damon Albarn in 2008, resulting in Blur starting to play live again in 2009, and returned to the band for their next album &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; (2015).

&quot;Think Tank&quot; is a loose concept album, which Albarn has stated is about &quot;love and politics&quot;. Albarn, a pacifist, had spoken out against the invasion of Afghanistan and, after Western nations threatened to invade Iraq, took part in the widespread protests against the war. Anti-war themes are recurrent in the album as well as in associated artwork and promotional videos.

After leaking onto the internet in March, &quot;Think Tank&quot; was released on 5 May 2003 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, making it Blur&#x27;s fifth consecutive studio album to reach the top spot. The album was later certified Gold. &quot;Think Tank&quot; also reached the top 20 in many other countries, including Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway and Japan. It was their highest charting album in the United States at the time, reaching number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album produced three singles, which charted at number 5, number 18 and number 22 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. After the album was released, Blur announced a world tour with Simon Tong filling in for Coxon.

==Background==
Although Blur had been associated with the Britpop movement, they had experimented with different musical styles more recently, beginning with &quot;Blur&quot; (1997) which had been influenced by indie rock bands under the suggestion of guitarist Graham Coxon. Since the mid to late 1990s, Blur&#x27;s members had been working on other projects as well as Blur: Albarn had co-created Gorillaz, a virtual band, in 1998 with comic artist Jamie Hewlett whom Albarn had met through Coxon. Gorillaz&#x27; 2001 debut was financially successful and received critical acclaim. Since composing the Blur song, &quot;You&#x27;re So Great&quot;, Coxon had started a solo career and as of 2001 had released three solo albums. The members&#x27; differing musical interests had alienated some of the band members, with Coxon explaining, &quot;we&#x27;re all very concerned for each other and we do genuinely like each other an awful lot. Because we&#x27;re into so much different stuff, it becomes daunting.&quot; Nevertheless, Coxon, along with Alex James and Dave Rowntree were keen for a new album, whilst Albarn was more reluctant.

Blur&#x27;s prior album, &quot;13&quot;, had made heavy use of experimental and electronic music with the guidance of producer William Orbit. Despite the success of the album and its associated singles, the overall sound of the album had been deemed as &quot;deliberately uncommercial&quot; compared to their previous efforts. Despite the broader musical landscaping which Blur were engaging in, Albarn said in a January 2001 interview that he wanted to make a more accessible album again, stating &quot;I&#x27;m trying to go back to the kind of songwriting aesthetic I had on (hit album) Parklife. They won&#x27;t be arranged in the same way at all – they&#x27;ll just be songs that are accessible to the public.&quot; He also explained his reasoning for this approach, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s too complicated being anything other than mainstream with Blur. That&#x27;s where it belongs. We still feel that the mainstream in Britain is not represented well enough by intelligent musicians.&quot;

After the September 11 attacks, a series of controversial military campaigns were launched, known as the War on Terror. In November 2001, shortly after the Invasion of Afghanistan, the MTV Europe Music Awards were held in Frankfurt, where Gorillaz won an award for Best Dance Act. As Albarn and Hewlett walked onto stage to make a speech, Albarn sported a T-shirt with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament logo on it. In Albarn&#x27;s speech, he said &quot;So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [pointing to the t-shirt] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bombing one of the poorest countries in the world is wrong. You&#x27;ve got a voice and you have got to do what you can about it, alright?&quot;

In 2002, Iraq was under threat of invasion from western nations. Opposition from the public led to protests being organised by a number of organisations. Albarn, who has described himself as being anti-war, spoke out against the invasion,&lt;ref name=&quot;NME 20/8/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; citing the lack of democratic process as an issue. Anti-war views had been shared with Albarn&#x27;s parents and grandparents. His grandfather, Edward Albarn, had died after going on a hunger strike the previous year. Albarn has labelled his grandfather, father, and himself as conscientious objectors.

Albarn teamed up with Robert &quot;3D&quot; Del Naja of Massive Attack and various campaigns to raise awareness of the potential dangers of the UK&#x27;s involvement in the war. Albarn was due to speak in Hyde Park on the rally in March 2003 when a million people took to the streets of London in protest at the imminent war. In the event, he was too emotional to deliver his speech.

==Recording==
Recording sessions for &quot;Think Tank&quot; started in November 2001 at Albarn&#x27;s 13 Studio in London. Albarn, James and Rowntree had come to the studio along with Ben Hillier, who explained that &quot;there was tension to begin with. Alex had made some belittling comment about Gorillaz in the press, but there was a &#x27;fuck you&#x27; and a &#x27;fuck you&#x27; and it was all mates again but for the fact that Graham was missing&quot;. During 2001, Coxon had been battling alcoholism and depression, and was unable to attend the initial recording session due to being in rehabilitation. Despite Coxon&#x27;s absence, the rest of the band decided to start recording without him.

By January 2002, the rest of the band were mainly recording demos that Albarn had started on a four-track and subsequently transferred into Logic with 13&#x27;s in-house engineers Tom Girling, Jason Cox and assistant, James Dring. Coxon rejoined the rest of the band for recording sessions in February and May 2002, with the foreknowledge that it would be &quot;tense in the studio&quot;. Coxon spent, what he described as &quot;awkward afternoons&quot;, contributing on the track &quot;Battery in Your Leg&quot;, and non-album B-sides &quot;The Outsider&quot;, &quot;Morricone&quot; and &quot;Some Glad Morning&quot;.

It was clear that during Coxon&#x27;s departure, the sound and musical direction was not to Coxon&#x27;s taste, and he no longer had a justifiable place in the band. Additionally, Coxon was advised by health professionals to avoid touring, which would naturally leave him in a more vulnerable position mentally. This was not received well with the band, or their record label, due to touring being a major part of promoting and selling a record.

In what has been described as &quot;miscommunication&quot;, Blur&#x27;s manager was directed to tell Coxon to not return to the studio for an indefinite time, prompting Coxon to leave the band after these few recording sessions. The remaining members of Blur decided to carry on recording alone, Albarn stating that &quot;the spirit of Blur was more important than the individuals&quot;.

In June, the band went back into the studio, doing &quot;tracking, overdubs and reworking what we&#x27;d already done, and all the time new songs would be popping up – I think we had 28 of them at one point.&quot; Albarn desired to have multiple producers involved in the album, wanting to get a &quot;name producer&quot; involved. Albarn had previously been in talks with Norman Cook, commonly known as Fatboy Slim, to be involved on the record, although he originally wanted to contribute &quot;just feedback and nothing else&quot;. Albarn eventually invited him to try and work with the band. Hillier and the band also spent time working with other producers, including the Dust Brothers, whilst the Neptunes were also reported to be involved at one point.

In August, the remaining members of Blur, along with Hillier, travelled to Morocco. James released a statement on the band&#x27;s website saying &quot;I suppose the idea at the bottom of this is to escape from whatever ghetto we&#x27;re in and free ourselves by going somewhere new and exciting.&quot; The band settled at Marrakesh where they equipped an old barn with a studio. Albarn claimed that most of the album&#x27;s lyrics were written &quot;under a cypress tree in Morocco&quot;. The sessions in Marrakesh produced &quot;Crazy Beat&quot;, &quot;Gene by Gene&quot;, and &quot;Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club&quot;. The vocal sessions took place at this time. While in Morocco, Albarn wrote a song about Cook and his partner, Zoë Ball, who were having troubles with their relationship. The song started out as a jam session, eventually evolving into &quot;Put It Back Together&quot;, which ended up on Fatboy Slim&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Palookaville&quot;, which was released in October 2004. After the band came back from Morocco, the remaining sessions took place in a barn on National Trust land in Devon.

William Orbit, who was the main producer on &quot;13&quot; was also involved in the album&#x27;s production, with Hillier stating that &quot;we sent a couple of tunes to William to work on in his studio, working round the clock in a computer environment the way he does. He&#x27;s a nutter and works all night. That was quite an interesting juxtaposition, us doing office hours then going to see William after work, just as he was getting up!&quot; Of Orbit&#x27;s productions, &quot;Sweet Song&quot; ended up on the album. Coxon&#x27;s absence also bolstered the role of Alex James and Dave Rowntree who provided backing vocals throughout the album. Rowntree also played the electric guitar on &quot;On the Way to the Club&quot; and provided a rap on a demo version of &quot;Sweet Song&quot;. A Moroccan orchestra is featured on the lead single, &quot;Out of Time&quot;.

==Musical style==

Despite Albarn stating that he originally wanted to return to their more commercial sound, &quot;Think Tank&quot; continues the jam-based studio constructions of previous album &quot;13&quot;. The album expanded on the use of sampled rhythm loops and brooding, heavy electronic sounds. Almost entirely written by Albarn, &quot;Think Tank&quot; placed more emphasis on lush backing vocals, simple acoustic guitar, drums, bass guitar, and a variety of other instruments.

&quot;We knew we had to come back with the best thing we&#x27;d ever done,&quot; observed James. &quot;I think it is. It&#x27;s next level shit!&quot;

Like many of Blur&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Think Tank&quot; is a loose concept album. Albarn has stated that it is an album about &quot;love and politics&quot;, stating that &quot;[Unease] forces people to value what they&#x27;ve got. And that, hopefully, will pay dividends and help change the world to a better place. Hopefully. Touch wood.&quot; Albarn also stated that the album is about &quot;what are you supposed to do as an artist other than express what is going on around you.&quot; Some of the songs are concerned with a sense of paranoia and alienation in British club culture. Damon also cited punk rock music, particularly the Clash, as an inspiration.
The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Ambulance&quot;, starts off with a complex drum beat. Sam Bloch of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; praised the song&#x27;s intro, describing the beat as &quot;an offbeat rhythmic synapse that nearly collapses into itself [...] Heavy electronic drums. A flash. A kick. At first, it&#x27;s really hard to believe that this is a song, functioning on its own. The beat needs crutches to stand upright.&quot; Devon Powers of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote that &quot;the first bars [...] are stricken with throbbing beats that sound simultaneously futuristic and primitive.&quot; Bloch went on to write: &quot;as a low, thunderous bass enters [the listener&#x27;s] speakers, the whole thing slowly grows. Distinctive African percussion is leisurely incorporated into the bass overtone—it&#x27;s the darkness in a thunderstorm, the pure, simple fury that comes before a glorious lightning streak.&quot;

At 0:52 Albarn&#x27;s lead vocals come in, repeating the lyrics &quot;I ain&#x27;t got nothin&#x27; to be scared of&quot; in a &quot;gauzy&quot; falsetto. This is accompanied by a &quot;languid&quot; bass groove and backing vocals described by Bloch as &quot;gospel-twinged&quot;, as well as a baritone sax line described by Powers as &quot;[cutting] underneath the back-up singers, at an angle—so quirky it feels like Morphine could have played it.&quot; As Albarn delivers the next line (cause I love you&quot;), a synthesizer kicks in, described by stylus as &quot;illustrious&quot;, &quot;otherworldly&quot; and &quot;flooding the song&#x27;s deathly stomp. But within this death there is love. Albarn makes this clear in the structure of this song.&quot; In Albarn&#x27;s next vocal lines, he drops out of falsetto into &quot;his low swinging monotone&quot;. Powers stated that he &quot;croons, carelessly, almost as if he&#x27;s freestyling. Things change again. They keep changing.&quot; Powers speculated that the song was about love but said &quot;it&#x27;s also a fitting introduction to a record that&#x27;s such an extreme departure from their past work, and so drastically left field from the garage and post-punk and easily accessible poprock currently drenching the airwaves&quot;.

In an XFM radio interview, Albarn spoke on the composition of the track, stating, &quot;I try to do a lot of stuff once I&#x27;ve got the melody and the chord structure. I try to just sing it in one go without thinking about it too much. It comes out a sort of partially formed song and sometimes you&#x27;re lucky and it comes out almost kind of sort of perfect and sometimes it&#x27;s just a mess.&quot; He stated that this was a case of the former. James said that &quot;Ambulance&quot; was &quot;the first song that I thought, right this is Blur again. Like I&#x27;m in the right place again. I suppose the lyrics have something to do with that, you know, having nothing to be scared of anymore.&quot;

Greenwald claimed that &quot;Out of Time&quot; was &quot;the album&#x27;s highlight&quot;. Describing the song as &quot;failure-soaked&quot; and &quot;heart-stoppingly lovely&quot;, Greenwald went on to say that it &quot;perfectly captures the jumble of beauty and dread that defines life under orange alert. &quot;Are we out of time?&quot; Albarn asks, desperate for one last peace march or one last snog.&quot; Powers described the song as &quot;a much more straightforward, apace ballad [compared to the previous song]. Dominant in the track are Albarn&#x27;s unadulterated vocals and steady, simplistic drums, but beyond that are ethereal, hard-to-identify noises. In the middle of the track, an Andalucian string group rears its head, as does a tambourine.&quot;

&quot;Crazy Beat&quot; was compared to &quot;Song 2&quot; from the band&#x27;s self-titled album. XFM described the song as &quot;Fatboy Slim meets Middle Eastern Punk rock ... energetic, punked-out rocker. But as much as this song might appeal to the neo-DIY set—complete with its jumpy chorus and lively melody—Blur are anything but. If there&#x27;s one thing Blur are known for, it&#x27;s lots and lots and lots of production. Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim), builds this number with tons of sound, so there&#x27;s always another active level to uncover.&quot; According to Albarn, the song &quot;started off in such a different way. The nearest thing I could compare it to is a really bad version of Daft Punk. So, we got sick of it and then put in that descending guitar line over it to rough it up a bit.&quot; He also stated &quot;It had this sort of mad vocoder-ish vocal and the melody was over a real sort of skanky groove and just this almost descending semi tonal guitar. The melody worked over it and it was amazing coz it shouldn&#x27;t have worked, another little magic moment for us.&quot;

Powers claimed that &quot;the best moments of this album are those when vintage Blur styles are evoked with new expertise. The meandering &quot;Good Song&quot; is a beautiful case in point. Acoustic guitar picking is matched with temperate drums and a sweet, steady bass countermelody. Albarn&#x27;s singing is mostly in his mid-range, falling out as easily as breath. Signature background vocal harmonies are there to brighten up the track, but their muted nature doesn&#x27;t descend into campiness. What&#x27;s also new is the expert use of electronic noises and drumbeats to fatten the sound.&quot; Albarn said &quot;well, that was originally called &#x27;De La Soul&#x27; on our huge list of songs, half finished ideas. It was called &#x27;De La Soul you know, right until the end. And I just always thought it was a good song and just called it &#x27;Good Song&#x27;. I love that, I love the sort of intimacy of it and I just think everyone really played gently on it, the melodies. It was a good melody.&quot;

&quot;On the Way to the Club&quot; was described by Albarn as &quot;a hangover song which we sort of write from time to time.&quot; Albarn also said that &quot;it&#x27;s definitely got a very individual sound. Someone said that it&#x27;s a sort of revived &quot;Screamadelica&quot;. Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of the good intentions of which you participate in revelry and then actually the reality of it.&quot;

&quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; was one of the last additions to the album. &quot;It was a kind of track that took quite a different direction for most of its life&quot;, said Rowntree. &quot;...And then right at the end we switched about and took it in a different direction, it wasn&#x27;t quite so dark.&quot; &quot;It sounded more like The Velvet Underground when we started&quot;, claimed Albarn. &quot;It was too overtly about one thing. It was too druggy, in a way, which is a kind of weird thing, &#x27;cause the song is all about drugs so I think we just pushed ourselves a bit more with it and gave it a lot more space – countered by the list and the list was kind of sort of inspired by the life of JFK and his need to have 28 drugs everyday of his Presidency just to keep him functioning.&quot;

Albarn described &quot;Caravan&quot; as &quot;a kind of song that you could play anywhere. And I mean I remember we just finished it and when everyone left to go back to London, I went down to Mali for a couple of days &#x27;cause Honest Jon&#x27;s [were] still working with musicians and stuff. I was sitting in a mango grove with a wild turkey and had a little CD player and I put it on there. It was just nice seeing everyone sitting around getting stoned to it. It was nice, &#x27;cause the guitar is very, much inspired by Afel; a great Malian tradition of blues guitar.&quot; &quot;I think this one&#x27;s about the sun going down, for me&quot;, James claimed. &quot;That was like a perfect studio moment; sitting on top of a strange barn in the Moroccan desert listening to Damon do a vocal and it a was a perfectly still time of day and the sun was perfectly red and there was just an immense sense of calm and this music.&quot;

Albarn claimed that &quot;Sweet Song&quot; was inspired by Coxon. Explaining the habit of putting &#x27;song&#x27; in the title, Albarn stated that it was &quot;another African thing that I&#x27;ve picked up. They do call things like &#x27;Tree Song&#x27;. You know what I mean; they give it something quite simple. It&#x27;s not, it doesn&#x27;t have an agenda so much, it&#x27;s offered out as a nice bit of music to everyone and that&#x27;s something that has changed massively in my life, I don&#x27;t see the ownership of things quite so strongly anymore.&quot;

There is a hidden track, &quot;Me, White Noise&quot; in the pregap before track 1 on some CD copies. The song guest features Phil Daniels, who previously appeared on &quot;Parklife&quot;, on vocals. Japanese versions of the album feature the song at track 30, after silent tracks at index points 15–29. On the &quot;Blur 21&quot; edition, the hidden track is placed after a few minutes of silence at the end of the last track.

The case contains a Parental Advisory logo in some regions, because &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; contains many drug references. Also, the hidden track &quot;Me, White Noise&quot; is one of the few Blur songs to contain an expletive.

==Artwork and packaging==
The album cover was stenciled by the graffiti artist Banksy. Despite Banksy stating that he normally avoids commercial work, he later defended his decision to do the cover, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve done a few things to pay the bills, and I did the Blur album. It was a good record and [the commission was] quite a lot of money. I think that&#x27;s a really important distinction to make. If it&#x27;s something you actually believe in, doing something commercial doesn&#x27;t turn it to shit just because it&#x27;s commercial. Otherwise you&#x27;ve got to be a socialist rejecting capitalism altogether, because the idea that you can marry a quality product with a quality visual and be a part of that even though it&#x27;s capitalistic is sometimes a contradiction you can&#x27;t live with. But sometimes it&#x27;s pretty symbiotic, like the Blur situation.&quot; The album&#x27;s cover art sold at auction in 2007 for £75,000. The fold out booklet of the album features the text &quot;Celebrity Harvest&quot;, which was the working name for a proposed, but ultimately unmade Gorillaz film. The name of the album comes from Bassist Alex James who said in a 2003 Interview &quot;It seemed to sum everything up.&quot;

==Release==
Prior to the album&#x27;s official release, it was leaked onto the internet. Rowntree said &quot;I&#x27;d rather it gushed&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m rabidly pro the internet and as many people hearing our albums as possible. If it hadn&#x27;t been leaked by someone we probably would&#x27;ve leaked it ourselves&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;xfm 2/7/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Albarn speculated that the leak helped the reception of their live shows, due to the songs&#x27; lyrics being more familiar to the audience.

===Commercial performance===
The album debuted in the US at number 56 with first-week sales of 20,000, becoming the highest peak of any Blur album in the US at that time. It has sold 94,000 copies in the US as of April 2015.

In the UK, the album debuted at the top spot, becoming their fifth consecutive number one album. The album remained in the top 10 for three weeks and the top 75 for a total of eight weeks, lacking the longevity and sales success of their previous releases.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Think Tank&quot; received mostly positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 83, which indicates &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, based on 26 reviews. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; writer Andrew Future deemed the album &quot;a genuine pleasure to behold&quot; and whilst stating that previous albums &quot;Blur&quot; and &quot;13&quot; were &quot;full of jump-start arrangements and fractured experimentalism&quot;, he described &quot;Think Tank&quot; as being &quot;lush in melody, flowing in windswept electronica with a myriad of bombastic orchestral backing one minute, before retracting into cocoons of melancholic and clustered acoustics the next.&quot; Playlouder called the album &quot;an extraordinary record that pushes boundaries and sets new standards.&quot; &quot;The beat-driven tracks,&quot; observed Steve Lowe in &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;veer towards the arty, white-boy-with-beatbox line of Talking Heads and The Clash (actually, the low-slung hip-pop of &#x27;Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club&#x27; even recalls Big Audio Dynamite). Only the trudging, tedious six-minute squib &#x27;Jets&#x27; really needs taking back to the shops.&quot; However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the album &quot;is the sound of Albarn run amuck, a (perhaps inevitable) development that even voracious Blur supporters secretly feared could ruin the band — and it has.&quot; He also described &quot;Think Tank&quot; as a &quot;lousy album&quot; on which the few strong tracks are &quot;severely hurt by Coxon&#x27;s absence&quot;.

Albarn became critical of the record over time. In 2015 he said: &quot;It&#x27;s... got some real stinkers on it – there&#x27;s some bollocks on there.&quot;

===Accolades===
Blur received a number of awards and nominations for &quot;Think Tank&quot;. At the 2003 Q Awards, &quot;Think Tank&quot; won the award for Best Album. This was the third time the band had received this award, previously winning in 1994 and 1995 for &quot;Parklife&quot; and &quot;The Great Escape&quot; respectively. Blur also received nomination for Best Act in the World Today and, along with Ben Hillier, were nominated in the Best Producer category. The album also won in the Best Album category at the South Bank Show Awards in 2004 and was nominated in a similarly titled category at the Danish Music Awards the same year. &quot;Think Tank&quot; was nominated for Best British Album at the 2004 Brit Awards. The promo videos for &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Good Song&quot; also won several awards.

At the end of the year, &quot;The Observer&quot; listed &quot;Think Tank&quot; as the best album of 2003, Miranda Sawyer writing that, &quot;&quot;Think Tank&quot; is the band&#x27;s first warm album. They have hopped genres in the past, from baggy to mod to pop to grunge to art-rock, but the sound has always stayed urban, Western, cool. &quot;Think Tank&quot; is none of these things. It&#x27;s all over the place, and that place is foreign. Odd noises, strange instruments, keening vocals; its tunes wind themselves around your heart like drifting smoke. They waft in from faraway lands; trail and trickle their scent across your life. It is the most peculiar stuff that stays with you; &quot;Ambulance&quot;&#x27;s slurred symphony; &quot;Caravan&quot;&#x27;s star-speckled wonder.&quot;

==Tour==
After the album&#x27;s release, Blur went on a world tour with former The Verve&#x27;s guitarist and keyboardist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon on guitar, in both new and old songs. However, Albarn later said that he felt the live shows were &quot;rubbish&quot; and bassist Alex James admitted that touring was not the same without Coxon.

Since Blur&#x27;s reunion with Coxon in 2009, the album has largely been absent from Blur&#x27;s setlists, with the exception of &quot;Out of Time&quot; (in a new arrangement with additional guitar parts by Coxon) and occasional performances of &quot;Battery in Your Leg&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Caravan&quot; in 2015.

<text>Idrissa Seck (born 9 August 1959) is a Senegalese politician who was Prime Minister of Senegal from November 2002 to July 2004. He was a leading member of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) and was considered a protégé of President Abdoulaye Wade, but he subsequently went into opposition and was a candidate in the February 2007 presidential election, coming second place with about 15% of the vote.

==Biography==
He was born in Thiès and studied in Paris as well as at Princeton University. He joined the PDS when he was 15 years old and was Wade&#x27;s campaign director in the 1988 Senegalese presidential election.

Seck served as Minister of Trade, Crafts, and Industrialization as an opposition member of Abdou Diouf&#x27;s government. He became deputy leader of the PDS in 1998, replacing Ousmane Ngom. After Wade took office in April 2000, he appointed Seck as Minister of State and Director of the Cabinet. The PDS was restructured after this election; Seck&#x27;s position of Executive Secretary was eliminated and he instead became Deputy National Secretary. He also became Mayor of Thiès.

Seck was appointed as prime minister by Wade on November 4, 2002, replacing Mame Madior Boye; this was the first time that Wade had appointed a prime minister from the PDS since he took office as president. Seck served as prime minister until July 21, 2004, when he was dismissed by Wade.

Seck was detained in July 2005 for alleged corruption in connection with a road project in Thiès, and he was additionally charged with threatening state security. In a decision made on August 4 and announced on August 6, he was expelled from the PDS by its steering committee, along with three of his supporters: Papa Diouf, Awa Gueye Kebe, and Oumar Sarr. He never faced trial; on January 27, 2006, the charge of threatening state security was dismissed, and in early February the corruption charges were also partially dismissed and he was released from prison. On April 4, 2006, he announced his intention to run for president in 2007.

On September 24, 2006, Seck announced the formation of a new party, Rewmi (Wolof for &quot;the country&quot;). On January 22, 2007, Wade said that Seck had agreed to return to the PDS. Seck confirmed this on February 1, but said that he would still run for president.

According to final results released after the presidential election, which was held on February 25, 2007, Seck took second place with 14.92% of the vote, falling far behind Wade, who won a majority in the first round. He won one of the country&#x27;s 34 departments, that of Thiès. Following the election, Wade announced that several opposition leaders would face prosecution for corruption, including Seck. Wade said that Seck had stolen 40 billion CFA francs and deposited the money abroad; he also said that Seck would not be his successor. Subsequently, after the final results were released on March 11, Seck congratulated Wade on his victory; he was the only major opposition leader to do so.

Seck&#x27;s Rewmi party participated in a boycott of the June 2007 parliamentary election, announced in early April. Seck said that Wade had broken off dialogue with the opposition and that it would reconsider the boycott if he engaged in dialogue.

After the election, a rapprochement between Wade and Seck and their respective parties began, and Seck sought to return to the PDS. On August 13, 2007, Wade said that the PDS steering committee would have to decide whether or not to readmit Seck and his supporters into the party. Seck and Wade met for several hours on January 12, 2009, and afterwards Seck announced that the two had resolved their &quot;misunderstandings&quot; and had reconciled.

Following the March 2009 local election in Thiès, Seck was again elected as Mayor of Thiès on April 21, 2009. He received 64 out of 69 votes from the municipal councillors.

On July 31, 2005, the parliamentary majority voted to indict Seck, as well as that of the Minister of Housing, Salif Bâ, before the High Court of Justice for « serious irregularities in the process of concluding public contracts ». The indictment obtained 69 votes out of 120 with 35 deputies voting against. The result of the vote was contested by some who maintained that the resolution did not obtain the number of votes necessary for its adoption (it would have taken at least 72 votes, i.e. the three-fifths required by Article 101 of the Constitution instead of the 69 obtained).

In 2006, the indictment against Idrissa Seck was reversed and after 199 days in prison, he was discreetly released on February 7.

<text>Nambaryn Enkhbayar (, ; born 1 June 1958) is a Mongolian politician. He served as the Prime Minister of Mongolia from 2000 to 2004, as Chairman of the State Great Khural from 2004 to 2005, and as President of Mongolia from 2005 to 2009. He is the first person to have held all of the top three positions in the Mongolian government. He was the chairman of the Mongolian People’s Party from 1997 to 2005 and head of Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party from 2010 to 2021. His eldest son, Batshugar Enkhbayar is a member of the State Great Khural from Mongolian People&#x27;s Party. Due to his corruption scandal he is regarded as the godfather of corruption in Mongolian politics by the public media.

==Early life and education==
Nambaryn Enkhbayar was born on 1 June 1958 in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. He finished a secondary school in 1975, and earned an undergraduate degree majoring in literature and language studies from Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow, Russia in 1980. He studied at an English language and literature course at Leeds University in the United Kingdom in 1985–1986. As a young man, he translated the works of Mongolian poet Mend-Ooyo Gombojav into English. Enkhbayar became the chairman of the Association of Mongolian Writers in 1990. He is married to Onongiin Tsolmon since 1987 and they have four children.

==Legislative career==
In 1992, as a member of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (MPRP) Enkhbayar was elected to the State Great Khural (Mongolian Parliament). Mongolia voted to retain former communist MPRP during its first venture into democratic elections, and Enkhbayar was appointed to serve as the country&#x27;s Minister of Culture. He held that post until 1996, when the Democratic Party ousted the MPRP in the parliamentary elections that year. In 1996 Enkhbayar became the secretary general of the MPRP and led the opposition MPRP group in the Parliament. In 1997 he was elected as the chairman of the MPRP.

==Prime minister==
In 1999, the country was hit by one of its infamous zud spells, when summer drought and cold weather blizzards resulted in severe food shortages and loss of thousands of livestock. The government responded poorly to the disaster and the MPRP received an unexpected boost from the climatological disaster. In 2000, the MPRP won 72 out of 76 seats in parliamentary elections. With the MPRP controlling the parliament, Enkhbayar became the country&#x27;s prime minister. He initiated an ambitious Millennium Road project to connect Mongolian territory from east to west. During Enkhbayar&#x27;s time as prime minister, he successfully eliminated Mongolia&#x27;s debt to the former Soviet Union; this was the first time since the 1920s that Mongolia did not owe debt to its northern neighbor. The debt was controversial due to Mongolia being a raw material supplier to the Soviet Union pricing the materials almost free for former USSR. International exposure of Mongolia&#x27;s vast mineral resources led to the economy experiencing 10% real GDP growth in 2004.

==Speaker of Parliament==
In 2004, MPRP lost to Motherland Democratic Coalition-a coalition of Democratic Party and Motherland Party. Due to election result where none of the coalition and the MPRP became the enough majority to hold the government, grand coalition government was formed and Enkhbayar became the speaker of the Parliament and served on this post in 2004–2005.

==President==
He won the 2005 presidential election and became the Mongolian president. He welcomed U.S. President George W. Bush who paid an official visit to Mongolia. It was the first visit of a U.S president to the country. Mongolia received US$285 million aid from the United States&#x27; Millennium Challenge Compact (MCC) which United States President George W. Bush signed with Enkhbayar in 2007.

In the 2009 Mongolian presidential election, incumbent president Enkhbayar was defeated by Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj of Democratic Party. Elbegdorj won 51.21% of total votes while Enkhbayar got 47.41%. Thus Enkhbayar became the first Mongolian president to lose re-election.

==New political party establishment==
In 2010, Enkhbayar established a political party and named it Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party. The party received approval to use the previous name of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party from the Supreme Court of Mongolia on 26 June 2011. Enkhbayar became the chairman of his established party.

==Convicted of corruption==
The Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) arrested Enkhbayar at the dawn of 13 April 2012. The IAAC stated that it arrested Enkhbayar for questioning in a graft case involving the illegal privatization of a government-owned hotel because he never showed up for questioning.

Over 1000 members of Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party and Enkhbayar&#x27;s supporters participated in Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party&#x27;s organized demonstration demanding Enkhbayar&#x27;s release on the same day of his arrest. On 4 May 2012, Enkhbayar announced a dry hunger strike demanding his release. He lost around 12 kilograms in 16 days. Amnesty International issued a statement demanding the Mongolian authority to respect human rights of Enkhbayar compatible to international standards. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made a phone call to President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj expressing concern over Enkhbayar&#x27;s health. Enkhbayar was released on bail on 14 May 2012. United States Senator Dianne Feinstein expressed to the U.S.Senate her pleasure for Enkhbayar&#x27;s release on bail and said &quot;For any democracy, due process and the rule of law are essential.&quot;

On 8 June 2012, the General Elections Committee (GEC) refused to register Enkhbayar as a candidate for the 2012 parliamentary elections in the MPRP party list listed as number one. It stated that the official documents sent from the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office and Sukhbaatar District Court of Ulaanbaatar required the rejection of Enkhbayar&#x27;s application pending the case. However, Enkhbayar and his lawyers argue that the incumbent president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, who took office in 2009, engineered the corruption case to keep him from running in the coming elections. They claim that the court gave them insufficient time to review the prosecutors&#x27; evidence and witness statements. The election authorities&#x27; denial of Enkhbayar&#x27;s candidacy on 6 June, they say, violates his constitutional right to be considered innocent until proven guilty. According to a US-based independent trial observer, the five charges leveled against Enkhbayar seem overblown and unsubstantiated. One accuses him of misappropriating TV equipment that was intended for a Buddhist monastery. Another alleges that he illegally shipped eight copies of his autobiography to South Korea on a government plane.

On 2 August 2012, after a three-day trial Sukhbaatar District Court convicted Enkhbayar of corruption and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, three of which was pardoned and then gave four years prison term and fined with over MNT 1.7 billion for misusing state properties and government power. Enkhbayar&#x27;s sentence was reduced to two and a half year prison term without the fine by the Supreme Court of Mongolia-the highest court in Mongolia.

On 1 August 2013, President of Mongolia Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj issued a decree to pardon Enkhbayar thus releasing him from the rest of his jail term effective on the decree date.

==Sports==
Enkhbayar climbed the highest peak in Mongolia, Khüiten Peak, with mountaineers of the Mongolian Mountaineering Federation and the Nepal Mountaineering Association on 23 June 2011.

==Religion==
Enkhbayar is a follower of Tibetan Buddhism. He translated several Buddhist texts into Mongolian.

<doc id="395035" wikidata="Q317670" url="?curid=395035" title="Driss Jettou">
<text>Driss Jettou (, ; born 24 May 1945) is a Moroccan politician, who served as the 13th prime minister of Morocco from 2002 to 2007.

==Early life and education==
Jettou was born in the town of El Jadida on 24 May 1945. After secondary studies at &quot;El Khawarizmi&quot; college in Casablanca, he obtained a technical Baccalauréat in mathematics in 1964. He then joined the Faculty of Sciences of Rabat University where he graduated in physics and chemistry in 1966. He also received a diploma of adjustment and management of company of Cordwainers Colleges of London in 1967.

==Career==
Between 1968 and 1993, Jettou occupied many managerial positions of several Moroccan companies. He then chaired the Moroccan Federation of industries of leather (FEDIC) and was a member of the General Confederation of the Companies in Morocco (CGEM) and later became the vice-president of the Moroccan Association of Exporters (ASMEX).

He holds the Wissam of the Throne (Grand Chevalier).

In 2008, he was decorated at the Throne Festival, the grand cordon of Wissam Al Arch by King Mohammed VI.
In 2005, on the eve of the visit of King Juan Carlos I of Spain to Morocco, he was elevated to the dignity of Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella (High Spanish distinction).
In 2010, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Carlos III. It is the highest civil distinction in Spain, created by Carlos III of Spain in a royal decree of 19 September 1771. The decoration aims at &quot;recognition of the citizens who, by their efforts, their initiative and work, have rendered a service extraordinary to the Spanish Nation&quot;.

==Political career== 

Jettou started his political career in 1993 when King Hassan II appointed him to be Minister of Trade and Industry. He was Minister of Economy and Finance from August 1997 to March 1998. Then he served as Minister of Interior from 2001 in the cabinet of Abderrahmane Youssoufi until he was appointed as prime minister by King Mohammed VI on 6 October 2002. His appointment was controversial as he was not then a member of any party, although he governed with a coalition that held a parliamentary majority. The Socialist Union of Forces for Progress and Istiqlal Party were the major parties of this coalition. In late 2004, he successfully led Morocco into a historic free trade agreement with the United States.

Following the September 2007 parliamentary election, Mohammed VI named Istiqlal leader Abbas El Fassi as Jettou&#x27;s successor as prime minister on 19 September 2007.

Jettou was appointed as President of the Audits Court on 9 August 2012, a move interpreted as meaning that King Mohammed would take full control of managing corruption cases.

In December 2019, he was appointed by the king of Morocco in the Special Committee on Model of Development.

<doc id="395037" wikidata="Q753290" url="?curid=395037" title="'Salem's Lot">
<text>Salem&#x27;s Lot is a 1975 horror novel by American author Stephen King. It was his second published novel. The story involves a writer named Ben Mears who returns to the town of Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot (or &#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot for short) in Maine, where he lived from the age of five through nine, only to discover that the residents are becoming vampires. The town is revisited in the short stories &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot&quot; and &quot;One for the Road&quot;, both from King&#x27;s story collection &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1978). The novel was nominated for the World Fantasy Award in 1976 and the Locus Award for the All-Time Best Fantasy Novel in 1987.

In two separate interviews in the 1980s, King said that, of all his books, &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; was his favorite. In his June 1983 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, the interviewer mentioned that because it was his favorite, King was planning a sequel, but King has said on his website that because &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series already continued the narrative in &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; and &quot;Song of Susannah&quot;, he felt there was no longer a need for a sequel. In 1987, he told Phil Konstantin in &quot;The Highway Patrolman&quot; magazine: &quot;In a way it is my favorite story, mostly because of what it says about small towns. They are kind of a dying organism right now. The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!&quot;

&quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; has been adapted into a 1979 two-part miniseries directed by Tobe Hooper and a 2004 television miniseries directed by Mikael Salomon. A feature film adaptation, written and directed by Gary Dauberman and starring Makenzie Leigh, Lewis Pulman, and Spencer Treat Clark, was released on Max in October 3, 2024. 

==Plot==
Ben Mears, a writer, has returned to Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot, Maine, after 25 years to try to write his next novel. He quickly becomes friends with high school teacher Matt Burke and starts a romantic relationship with Susan Norton, a young college graduate with ambitions of leaving town. Ben returned to &quot;the Lot&quot; to write a book about the long-abandoned Marsten House, where he had a bad childhood experience when he saw a hanging ghost. He learns that the house—the former home of Depression-era hitman Hubert &quot;Hubie&quot; Marsten—has been purchased by Kurt Barlow, ostensibly an Austrian immigrant who has arrived in the Lot to open an antique furniture store. Barlow is supposedly on an extended buying trip; only his business partner, Richard Straker, is publicly seen. The truth, however, is that Barlow is an ancient vampire, and Straker is his human familiar.

The duo&#x27;s arrival coincides with the disappearance of a young boy, Ralphie Glick, and the death of his 12-year-old brother, Danny, who becomes the town&#x27;s first vampire turned by Barlow. Barlow also turns town dump custodian Dud Rogers and telephone repairman Corey Bryant. Danny turns other locals into vampires, including the graveyard digger, Mike Ryerson, a newborn baby, Randy McDougall, a man named Jack Griffen, and Danny&#x27;s mother, Marjorie. Danny fails to turn his classmate Mark Petrie, who resists him by holding a plastic cross in Danny&#x27;s face. To fight the spread of the new vampires, Ben and Susan are joined by Matt Burke and his doctor, Jimmy Cody, along with Mark and the local priest, Father Callahan. Susan is captured by Barlow, who turns her. She is eventually staked through the heart by Ben.

When Father Callahan and Mark go to Mark&#x27;s house to explain the danger that his family is in, the power is suddenly cut off, and Barlow appears. After killing Mark&#x27;s parents, Barlow takes the boy hostage. Callahan pulls out his cross to drive him off until Barlow challenges him to throw the cross away. Callahan, not having faith enough to do so, is soon overwhelmed by Barlow, who forces Callahan to drink his blood, making him &quot;unclean.&quot; When Callahan tries to re-enter his church, he receives an electric shock, preventing him from going inside. Defeated, Callahan leaves Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot.

Matt suffers a fatal heart attack, while Jimmy is killed when he falls from a rigged staircase and is impaled by knives set up by the vampires. Ben and Mark destroy Barlow, but they are lucky enough to escape with their lives and are forced to leave the town to the now-leaderless vampires. Ben returns the following day to retrieve and bury the bodies of Mark&#x27;s parents and Jimmy Cody in a clearing behind the Petrie residence. The novel&#x27;s prologue, set shortly after the end of the story proper, describes Ben and Mark&#x27;s flight across the country to a seaside town in Mexico, where they attempt to recover from their ordeal. Mark is received into the Catholic Church by a friendly local priest and confesses for the first time what they have experienced. An epilogue reveals the two return to the town one year later, intending to renew the battle. Knowing that there are too many hiding places for the vampires, Ben starts a brush fire in the nearby woods with the intent of destroying the town.

==Background==
While teaching a course on fantasy and science fiction for students at Hampden Academy, King was inspired by &quot;Dracula&quot;, one of the books covered in the class. &quot;One night over supper I wondered aloud what would happen if Dracula came back in the twentieth century, to America. &#x27;He&#x27;d probably be run over by a yellow cab on Park Avenue and killed,&#x27; my wife said. (In the introduction to the 2004 audiobook recording that Stephen King read himself, he says it was he who said, &quot;Probably he&#x27;d land in New York and be killed by a taxi cab, like Margaret Mitchell in Atlanta&quot; and that it was his wife who suggested a rural setting for the book.) That closed the discussion, but in the following days, my mind kept returning to the idea. It occurred to me that my wife was probably right – if the legendary Count came to New York, that is. But if he were to show up in a sleepy little country town, what then? I decided I wanted to find out, so I wrote &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, which was originally titled &quot;Second Coming&quot;.&quot; Though King initially planned to title the novel &quot;Second Coming&quot;, he changed it to &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot&quot; on the advice of his wife, novelist Tabitha King, who thought the original title sounded too much like a &quot;bad sex story.&quot; King&#x27;s publishers then shortened it to the current title, thinking the author&#x27;s choice sounded too religious. King&#x27;s paperback publisher bought the book for $550,000.

King expands on this thought of the 20th-century vampire in his essay for &quot;Adeline Magazine&quot;, &quot;On Becoming a Brand Name&quot; (February 1980): &quot;I began to turn the idea over in my mind, and it began to coalesce into a possible novel. I thought it would make a good one, if I could create a fictional town with enough prosaic reality about it to offset the comic-book menace of a bunch of vampires.&quot; Yet the inspirations for &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; go back even further. In &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, a non-fiction overview of the modern horror genre, King recalls a dream he had when he was eight years old. In the dream, he saw the body of a hanged man dangling from the arm of a scaffold on a hill. &quot;The corpse bore a sign: ROBERT BURNS. But when the wind caused the corpse to turn in the air, I saw that it was my face – rotted and picked by birds, but obviously mine. And then the corpse opened its eyes and looked at me. I woke up screaming, sure that a dead face would be leaning over me in the dark. Sixteen years later, I was able to use the dream as one of the central images in my novel &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;. I just changed the name of the corpse to Hubie Marsten.&quot;

King first wrote of Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot in the short story &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, penned in college, but not published until years later in the short story collection &quot;Night Shift&quot;. In a 1969 installment of &quot;The Garbage Truck&quot;, a column King wrote for the University of Maine at Orono&#x27;s campus newspaper, King foreshadowed the coming of &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; by writing: &quot;In the early 1800s a whole sect of Shakers, a rather strange, religious persuasion at best, disappeared from their village (Jeremiah&#x27;s Lot) in Vermont. The town remains uninhabited to this day.&quot;

Politics during the time influenced King&#x27;s writing of the story. The corruption in the government was a significant factor in the inspiration of the story. Of this he recalls,
==Illustrated edition==
In 2005, Centipede Press released a deluxe limited edition of &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; with black and white photographs by Jerry Uelsmann and the two short stories &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot&quot; and &quot;One for the Road&quot;, as well as over 50 pages of deleted material. The book was limited to 315 copies, each signed by Stephen King and Jerry Uelsmann. The book was printed on 100# Mohawk Superfine paper, measured , was over thick, and weighed more than . The book included a ribbon marker, head and tail bands, three-piece cloth construction, and a slipcase. An unsigned hardcover edition limited to 600 copies was later released. Both the signed and unsigned editions sold out. In an interview with the printed trade journal &quot;Fine Books &amp; Collections&quot;, King said of the illustrated folio version of his &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, &quot;I think it&#x27;s beautiful!&quot; A trade edition was later released.

==Reception==
In the short story anthology &quot;A Century of Great Suspense Stories&quot;, editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King
Peter Straub recalls that &quot;One day I wandered into a very good book store and saw &quot;Salem’s Lot&quot; on the main table. If I had known that the book was about vampires, I might not have bought it. But I did buy it, and when I learned that one of the main characters was a vampire, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I thought, &#x27;Oh my God, this guy is working with a very tired, almost exhausted, trope and he’s making something really vibrant out of it.&#x27; So I became a huge Stephen King fan on the spot.&quot;
Neil Gaiman recalls that &quot;My first encounter with Stephen King, long before I met him in the flesh, was on East Croydon station in about 1975. I was fourteen. I picked up a book with an all-black cover. It was called &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;... I stayed up late finishing &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, loving the Dickensian portrait of a small American town destroyed by the arrival of a vampire. Not a nice vampire, a proper vampire. &quot;Dracula&quot; meets &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. After that I bought everything King wrote as it came out. Some books were great, and some weren&#x27;t. It was okay. I trusted him.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
=== Film and television ===
In 1979, &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; was adapted as a three-hour two-part television miniseries of the same name that aired on CBS. It stars David Soul as Ben Mears, and was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards and an Edgar Award. It was filmed on location in Ferndale, California. A truncated two-hour version was also released in cinemas in some countries. In 1987, Larry Cohen directed the film &quot;A Return to Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;. Marketed as a sequel to the 1979 miniseries, the film does not include any of the original characters despite using the image of Barlow from the 1979 version on the poster. In 2004, TNT premiered a new television adaptation of &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, also a three-hour, two-part miniseries, starring Rob Lowe as Ben Mears. It also received a Primetime Emmy nomination.

In 2018, the eighth episode of the &quot;Castle Rock&quot; TV series (centered around the fictional town created by King) entitled &quot;Past Perfect&quot; was aired, which briefly showed a present-day bus stop in Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot. A traffic sign indicated that the town was located 24 miles away from Castle Rock. The Marsten House is a primary location in the show&#x27;s second season. 

The 2021 Epix television series &quot;Chapelwaite&quot;, starring Adrien Brody and Emily Hampshire, is loosely based on the short story &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; set in the 19th century. 

A theatrical film adaptation of &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, from New Line Cinema, was announced in April 2019, with Gary Dauberman set to write and direct, and James Wan attached to produce. Filming began in Boston in September 2021. Lewis Pullman stars as Ben Mears, while Spencer Treat Clark and Makenzie Leigh will co-star as Mike Ryerson and Susan Norton respectively. The film was originally scheduled to be released in cinemas on September 9, 2022, but was pushed back to April 21, 2023, before being pulled from Warner Bros. release schedule indefinitely. The film premiered directly on Max on October 3, 2024.

=== Radio ===

The novel was adapted in the UK as a radio drama on BBC Radio 4 in 1994.

<text>Khin Nyunt (; ; born 23 October 1939) is a retired Burmese army general widely recognized for his influential role in shaping Myanmar&#x27;s political dynamics. Serving as the Chief of Intelligence and Prime Minister of Myanmar from 25 August 2003 to 18 October 2004, he played a crucial part in the nation&#x27;s history. During his tenure, Khin Nyunt oversaw significant developments in Myanmar&#x27;s intelligence and apparatus and government policies. He was instrumental in implementing reforms aimed at modernizing intelligence operations and promoting national security interests. However his leadership faced challenges, and he was eventually removed from power in 2004 amid political reshuffles within the ruling military junta. Despite his removal from office, Khin Nyunt&#x27;s legacy continued to be debated, with some viewing him as a reformist figure and others critiquing his approach to governance.

Born on 23 October 1939 in Kyauktan Township, near Rangoon (now Yangon), His early life was marked by a unique cultural heritage. Hailing from a family of Burmese Chinese descent, his parents were Hakkas from Meixian, Meizhou, Guangdong, China. Khin Nyunt played a significant role in Myanmar&#x27;s political landscape. Khin Nyunt graduated from the 25th batch of the Officers Training School, Bahtoo, in 1960, after he dropped out of Yankin College in the 1950s, forging a path that would intertwine with intelligence operations and key political roles. His military career led him to the position of Chief of Intelligence, where he played a crucial role in the country&#x27;s internal security. His political journey reached its pinnacle when he assumed the office of Prime Minister of Myanmar on 25 August 2003, succeeding Senior General Than Shwe. However, his tenure was short-lived, lasting until 18 October 2004. As Prime Minister, Khin Nyunt faced challenges and controversies, including the proposal of a seven-point roadmap to democracy, criticized for its perceived lack of clarity and military involvement. His leadership oversaw the recalling of the suspended National Convention, influencing Myanmar&#x27;s political trajectory. Dismissed from power on 18 October 2004 amid internal military struggles, Khin Nyunt faced corruption charges and received a 44-year prison sentence. Released from house arrest on 13 January 2012, he entered a new phase, establishing a presence in Yangon with a coffee shop, art gallery, and souvenir shop. In an interview in April 2012, Khin Nyunt claimed that he personally intervened to save Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s life during the Depayin massacre, by ordering his men to take her to a safe location.

==Early life and education==
Khin Nyunt was born on 23 October 1939, in Kyauktan Township, near Rangoon (now Yangon). He is of Burmese Chinese descent, with parents who were Hakkas from Meixian, Meizhou, Guangdong, China. 

Khin Nyunt graduated from the 25th batch of the Officers Training School, Bahtoo in 1960, after dropping out of Yankin College in the late 1950s.

==Political career==
After his military career, he was ordered back to Rangoon in 1984 after an attack on a visiting South Korean delegation. Twenty-one people, including three South Korean cabinet ministers, died during the attack, which occurred on 9 October 1983 and was perpetrated by terrorists sent from North Korea. Khin Nyunt was then appointed Chief of Intelligence. From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s Khin Nyunt was considered to be a protégé of General Ne Win, who supposedly retired from politics in 23 July 1988 but who is thought to have continued to be an influential figure behind the scenes until about the late 1990s.

The 1988 uprising that occurred from March to September 1988 was quelled by the military when the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) was formed on 18 September 1988. The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) was renamed as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in 15 November 1997, and Khin Nyunt was appointed as its first secretary (Secretary −1), a post which he held until his appointment as prime minister in 25 August 2003.

Shortly after Khin Nyunt was appointed as prime minister, he announced a seven-point roadmap to democracy on 30 August 2003; this roadmap was heavily criticized by the Burmese opposition as well as by many foreign governments especially Western ones as it envisaged a permanent military participation in the government. The so-called &#x27;systematic and step-by-step implementation of the road-map to democracy&#x27; also contained no time-line.

The first &#x27;step&#x27; of the road map was the recalling of the suspended National Convention which first met in January 1993. The National Convention (NC) was supposed to &#x27;lay down&#x27; the basic principles for a new Constitution. The NC met sporadically until the approval of a new constitution in 2008 by what many observers considered the rigged 2008 constitutional referendum.

===Prime minister===
After Khin Nyunt&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister of Myanmar, his role in the government gave rise to some hope and speculation that there might be some &#x27;liberalization&#x27;, as Khin Nyunt was considered a moderate pragmatist who saw the need of a dialogue with the democratic opposition. The SPDC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe and his deputy, Vice-Senior General Maung Aye, were seen as hardliners who opposed any relaxation of the military&#x27;s iron grip of the country.

===Controversy===
From 1988 until his purge in 2004, Khin Nyunt oversaw the arrest of around 10,000 people. Many were subjected to torture and farcical trials that resulted in decades-long prison sentences. Dozens of his military intelligence units harassed, intimidated and detained opposition activists. His military intelligence units infiltrated almost every organization in the country and maintained networks of spies in almost every neighbourhood. Their agents were placed in customs, immigration and police departments, and officers military intelligence even monitored other senior military officials, including top generals.

Khin Nyunt was instrumental in closing the universities, then reopening them after they had been relocated to remote, ill-equipped campuses where students could no longer organise protests or get a meaningful education.

===Arrest and release===
On 18 October 2004, in a one-sentence announcement signed by SPDC Chairman Than Shwe, Khin Nyunt was &quot;permitted to retire on health grounds&quot;. However, he was immediately arrested and placed under protective custody.

Allegations of Khin Nyunt&#x27;s corruption were officially made several days later. His dismissal and arrest were the result of a power struggle in which the junta&#x27;s strongman, Than Shwe, successfully managed to clip the power of the &quot;intelligence faction&quot; of the Myanmar Armed Forces which Khin Nyunt led. Most of the Generals and military officers in the SPDC, like Senior General Than Shwe, did not want to negotiate with Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy (NLD).

On 5 July 2005, Khin Nyunt was tried by a Special Tribunal inside Insein Prison near Rangoon on various corruption charges. On 21 July 2005, he was sentenced to 44 years in prison, though it is believed that he is ostensibly serving his sentence under house arrest instead of in prison. His sons were also sentenced to 51 and 68 years respectively. It is unclear whether his wife was also indicted.

In July 2009, a video of Khin Nyunt at the home of former Burmese minister Brigadier-General Tint Swe, taken on 7 July 2009, was leaked to the public and there have been reports that Khin Nyunt and his wife have been able to travel outside their home on occasion, since March 2008. In December 2010, another 16-minute video of Khin Nyunt meeting with the Chief of Police Khin Yi and other senior police officers was circulated on YouTube.

Khin Nyunt&#x27;s brother-in-law was Than Nyein, a long-term political prisoner under military regime and founder of National Democratic Force Party, who died of lung cancer in Yangon on 21 May 2014. Khin Nyunt was released from house arrest on 13 January 2012 by the order of President Thein Sein.

==Later life==
After his release from house arrest, Khin Nyunt resettled in a villa in Yangon. There, he established a coffee shop, art gallery, and a souvenir shop featuring items like wood carvings for tourists. On 2 March 2015, Khin Nyunt published a 657-page autobiography, providing insights into various aspects of his life. On 5 December 2021, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the current Commander-in-Chief of the Tatmadaw, visited Khin Nyunt&#x27;s home. It has been reported that the former general is facing health challenges, specifically from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Personal life==
Khin Nyunt is married to Khin Win Shwe, a medical doctor, and has two sons. He reportedly has seven grandchildren.

<text>The boiling frog is an apologue describing a frog being slowly boiled alive. The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.

While some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to modern biologists the premise is false: changing location is a natural thermoregulation strategy for frogs and other ectotherms, and is necessary for survival in the wild. A frog that is gradually heated will jump out. Furthermore, a frog placed into already boiling water will die immediately, not jump out.

==As metaphor==
The boiling frog story is generally offered as a metaphor cautioning people to be aware of even gradual change lest they suffer eventual undesirable consequences. It may be invoked in support of a slippery slope argument as a caution against creeping normality. It is also used in business to reinforce that change needs to be gradual to be accepted. The term &quot;boiling frog syndrome&quot; is a metaphor used to describe the failure to act against a problematic situation which will increase in severity until reaching catastrophic proportions. It thereby encapsulates the barely noticeable impact of slow environmental degradation that has been described by Daniel Pauly as shifting baselines.

The story has been retold many times and used to illustrate widely varying viewpoints: in 1960 about warning against those who wished for detente during the Cold War; in 1980 about the impending collapse of civilization anticipated by survivalists; in the 1990s about inaction in response to climate change and staying in abusive relationships. It has also been used by libertarians to warn about the slow erosion of civil liberties.

In the 1996 novel &quot;The Story of B&quot;, environmentalist author Daniel Quinn spends a chapter on the metaphor of the boiling frog, using it to describe human history, population growth and food surplus. Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s character Harry Dalton mentioned it in the 1997 disaster movie &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; in reference to the accumulating warning signs of the volcano&#x27;s reawakening. Al Gore used a version of the story in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, in his presentations and the 2006 movie &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; to describe ignorance about global warming. In the movie version the frog is rescued before it is harmed. This use of the story was referenced by writer/director Jon Cooksey in the title of his 2010 comedic documentary &quot;How to Boil a Frog&quot;.

Law professor and legal commentator Eugene Volokh commented in 2003 that regardless of the behavior of real frogs, the boiling frog story is useful as a metaphor, comparing it to the metaphor of an ostrich with its head in the sand. Economics Nobel laureate and &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed writer Paul Krugman used the story as a metaphor in a July 2009 column, while pointing out that real frogs behave differently. Journalist James Fallows has been advocating since 2006 for people to stop retelling the story, describing it as a &quot;stupid canard&quot; and a &quot;myth&quot;. After Krugman&#x27;s column appeared, however, he declared &quot;peace on the boiled frog front&quot; and said that using the story is acceptable if the writer points out that it is not literally true.

==In philosophy==
In philosophy, the boiling frog story has been used as a way of explaining the sorites paradox. It describes a hypothetical heap of sand from which individual grains are removed one at a time, and asks if there is a specific point when it can no longer be defined as a heap.

==Experiments and analysis==
During the 19th century, several experiments were performed to observe the reaction of frogs to slowly heated water. In 1869, while doing experiments searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog that has had its brain removed will remain in slowly heated water, but an intact frog attempted to escape the water when it reached 25 °C.

Other 19th-century experiments were purported to show that frogs did not attempt to escape gradually heated water. An 1872 experiment by Heinzmann was said to show that a normal frog would not attempt to escape if the water was heated slowly enough, which was corroborated in 1875 by Fratscher.

In 1888, William Thompson Sedgwick said that the apparent contradiction between the results of these experiments was a consequence of different heating rates used in the experiments: &quot;The truth appears to be that if the heating be sufficiently gradual, no reflex movements will be produced even in the normal frog; if it be more rapid, yet take place at such a rate as to be fairly called &#x27;gradual&#x27;, it will not secure the response of the normal frog under any circumstances&quot;. Goltz had raised the temperature of the water from 17.5 °C to 56 °C in about ten minutes, or 3.8 °C per minute, in his experiment, whereas Heinzmann heated the frogs over the course of 90 minutes from about 21 °C to 37.5 °C, a rate of less than 0.2 °C per minute. Edward Wheeler Scripture recounted this conclusion in &quot;The New Psychology&quot; (1897): &quot;a live frog can actually be boiled without a movement if the water is heated slowly enough; in one experiment the temperature was raised at a rate of 0.002°C per second, and the frog was found dead at the end of 2½ hours without having moved.&quot;

Modern scientific sources report that the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Douglas Melton, a biologist at Harvard University, said, &quot;If you put a frog in boiling water, it won&#x27;t jump out. It will die. If you put it in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don&#x27;t sit still for you.&quot; George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that &quot;If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out.&quot; In 2002, Victor H. Hutchison, a retired zoologist at the University of Oklahoma with a research interest in thermal relations of amphibians, said that &quot;The legend is entirely incorrect!&quot; He described how a critical thermal maximum for many frog species has been determined by contemporary research experiments: as the water is heated by about 2 °F (about 1 °C), per minute, the frog becomes increasingly active as it tries to escape, and eventually jumps out if it can.

<doc id="395049" wikidata="Q319916" url="?curid=395049" title="Bernard Makuza">
<text>Bernard Makuza (born 30 September 1962) is a Rwandan politician who was Prime Minister of Rwanda from 8 March 2000 to 6 October 2011. He also served as President of the Senate of Rwanda from 14 October 2014 to 17 October 2019.

==Background==
Makuza&#x27;s father was Anastase Makuza, who served as a minister during Grégoire Kayibanda&#x27;s presidency. Like his father, Bernard Makuza attended Saint Léon Minor Seminary of Kabgayi. 

==Career==
Makuza was a member of the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR) before the party was dissolved on 14 April 2003 because of its history of promoting genocide ideology. Makuza resigned his membership in the MDR before being appointed prime minister. In 2006, during his term as prime minister, Makuza identified as belonging to no party.

==Prime minister==
Makuza was the Rwandan Ambassador to Burundi and then Ambassador to Germany before being appointed as prime minister in March 2000. His appointment to the latter post by President Pasteur Bizimungu followed the resignation of Prime Minister Pierre-Célestin Rwigema, who had been heavily criticized in the Rwandan press and by some parliamentarians.

Makuza remained at the head of a new government named on March 8, 2008, which was composed of 21 ministers and six secretaries of state.

==Senate==
On 6 October 2011, President Kagame appointed Pierre Habumuremyi to replace Makuza as prime minister. Makuza was instead appointed to the Senate. In the Senate, Makuza served as Vice-President for Legislation and Government Oversight. He was subsequently elected as President of the Senate, with 25 out of 26 votes in favor and no opposing candidate, and sworn in on 14 October 2014.

<doc id="395058" wikidata="Q654433" url="?curid=395058" title="Theo-Ben Gurirab">
<text>Theo-Ben Gurirab (23 January 1938 – 14 July 2018) was a Namibian politician who served in various senior government positions. He served as the second prime minister of Namibia from 28 August 2002 to 20 March 2005, following the demotion and subsequent resignation of Hage Geingob. Previously he was the country&#x27;s first Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 2002 and was President of the United Nations General Assembly from 1999 to 2000. He was Speaker of the National Assembly of Namibia from 2005 to 2015, when he was replaced by Peter Katjavivi. Gurirab ultimately resigned from politics in 2015.

==Early life and education==
Gurirab was born on 23 January 1938 in Usakos in the Erongo Region. In 1960 he obtained a teaching diploma from the Augustineum Training College in Okahandja, and in 1964 while in exile in the United States, he graduated with a degree in political science from Temple University in Pennsylvania.

==Political career==
Gurirab was in exile from 1962 to 1989. He fled first to Tanganyika, where he won a United Nations study fellowship and relocated to the United States. 
He was Associate Representative of the SWAPO Mission to the United Nations and the United States from 1964 to 1972, then Head of the SWAPO Mission to the United Nations from 1972 to 1986. Subsequently, he was SWAPO&#x27;s Secretary for Foreign Affairs from 1986 to 1990.

He was a SWAPO member of the Constituent Assembly which was in place from November 1989 to March 1990, immediately before independence, and the &quot;key drafter&quot; of Namibia&#x27;s Constitution. From 1990 to 2015 he was a member of the National Assembly, and he also served on the Central Committee and Politburo of SWAPO. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs from independence in 1990 until he was appointed as prime minister by President Sam Nujoma on 27 August 2002, replacing Hage Geingob.

While serving as Foreign Minister, he was elected as the president of the United Nations General Assembly on 14 September 1999, serving in that position until September 2000. Among Gurirab&#x27;s achievements at the UN was chairing the negotiations that brought about the reintegration of Walvis Bay into Namibian territory, in fulfillment of Security Council resolution 432.

Following the 2004 election, Gurirab was elected as Speaker of the National Assembly at the beginning of the new parliamentary term on 20 March 2005.

He received the sixth highest number of votes—377—in the election to the Central Committee of SWAPO at the party&#x27;s August 2002 congress. He was again one of the highest-scoring candidates in the election to the Central Committee at SWAPO&#x27;s November 2007 congress.

From 2008 to 2011, Gurirab was the president of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), an international organization of parliaments of sovereign states.

Gurirab was re-elected to the National Assembly in the November 2009 parliamentary election, in which SWAPO retained a large majority of seats. When the MPs took their seats for the new parliamentary term on 19 March 2010, they unanimously re-elected Gurirab to his post as Speaker of the National Assembly. Speaking on that occasion, Guiriab stressed the importance of the Constitution: &quot;As one of its authors, and among the longest-serving public officials, and founders of our Republic, I know of the highest vision the Constitution provides for Namibia, as well as the promise of national unity, reconciliation, democracy, the rule of law, human dignity, socio-economic emancipation and the commitment to protect the gains of our long and bitter struggle for liberation and independence.&quot;

In late August 2014, when SWAPO chose its list of parliamentary candidates for the November 2014 general election, Gurirab was not on the list. When the National Assembly began meeting for its new term on 20 March 2015, Gurirab was succeeded as Speaker by Peter Katjavivi.

==Death==
Gurirab died at a Windhoek hospital on 14 July 2018 of natural causes. He is buried at Heroes&#x27; Acre.

==Awards==
* 1999: Doctorate of Law &quot;honoris causa&quot;, University of Namibia
* Order of the Sun First Class
* since 2002: member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation
* 2000: Honorary Professorship of Foreign Affairs, China Foreign Affairs University, Beijing. Gurirab was only the third foreigner to be bestowed with this title.

<doc id="395059" wikidata="Q544141" url="?curid=395059" title="Hama Amadou">
<text>Hama Amadou (3 March 1950 – 23 October 2024) was a Nigerien politician who was Prime Minister of Niger from 1995 to 1996 and again from 2000 to 2007. He was also Secretary-General of the National Movement for the Development of Society (MNSD-Nassara) from 1991 to 2001 and President of the MNSD-Nassara from 2001 to 2009. Amadou was from the Kurtey, a Fula sub-group, and was raised in the Tillaberi Region, in the Niger River valley, north of Niamey.

Following corruption allegations against his government, he was removed from office as Prime Minister through a 2007 no-confidence vote in the National Assembly of Niger. In 2008, he became the target of a corruption investigation which saw him arrested to face criminal charges at the Nigerien High Court of Justice and removed from his post as MNSD President.

From 2011 to 2014, Amadou was President of the National Assembly of Niger. He was elected to that post as an ally of President Mahamadou Issoufou, but in 2013 he went into opposition. He fled Niger in August 2014 to escape arrest on charges related to a baby-trafficking investigation. Upon those charges, Amadou was sentenced to one year in prison, in March 2017, by the Niamey Court of Appeals. Amadou was tried in absentia, since he was exiled in France.

==Early life==
Hama Amadou was born on 3 March 1950, in Youri.

==Under Kountché and Saibou==
During the regime of Seyni Kountché, Amadou was Director-General of the Office of Radio Broadcasting and Television of Niger (ORTN) from 1983 to 1985 and became Director of the Cabinet in 1985. Following Kountché&#x27;s death, Amadou was named Minister of Information under his successor, Ali Saibou, on 15 July 1988, serving until 20 December 1989.

==Third Republic==
At an MNSD congress held in November 1991, Amadou was elected as its Secretary-General, while Tandja Mamadou was elected as the President of the MNSD.

Amadou was elected to the National Assembly in the February 1993 parliamentary election as an MNSD candidate in Niamey.

In another election held in January 1995, an opposition alliance, primarily composed of the MNSD and the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS), won a majority of seats, resulting in cohabitation between the government, led by Amadou, and President Mahamane Ousmane. Initially, the parliamentary majority put forward Amadou as its sole candidate for the position of prime minister, rather than submit three candidates from which Ousmane would choose the prime minister. Ousmane rejected this and appointed Amadou Cissé, also an MNSD member, as prime minister, but the parliamentary majority would not accept Cissé. Ousmane backed down and appointed Amadou as prime minister after two weeks, on 21 February 1995. Amadou and Ousmane came into sharp conflict with one another, and the political system became paralyzed by the dispute. Beginning in April 1995, Ousmane refused to attend meetings of the Council of Ministers; Amadou replaced parastatal managers in July despite Ousmane&#x27;s objections, and Amadou attempted to assume the presidential role with regard to the Council of Ministers.

==Under Maïnassara==
On 27 January 1996, a military coup led by Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara ousted both Amadou and Ousmane, and they were both placed under house arrest for several months.

On 2 January 1998, Amadou was arrested for allegedly leading a plot to assassinate Maïnassara. He was released on bail on 8 January, but was charged with forming an illegal militia. Amadou denied the charge and said that the arrest was political harassment and a means to distract the people.

==Fourth Republic==
Maïnassara was assassinated in an April 1999 coup, and new elections were held in late 1999. The MNSD&#x27;s presidential candidate, Tandja Mamadou, won the presidential election. In the parliamentary election, held in November, the MNSD again won the largest number of seats, and through an alliance with Ousmane&#x27;s party, the Democratic and Social Convention (CDS-Rahama), it held a majority in the new parliament.

Amadou was again elected to the National Assembly in the 1999 parliamentary election as an MNSD candidate from Niamey, but left his seat to become Prime Minister on 3 January 2000. On this occasion he told the deputies of the National Assembly that Niger faced a &quot;disastrous&quot; financial situation and that &quot;the coffers are absolutely empty&quot;, asking them to temporarily go without their salaries as deputies.

As President of Niger, Tandja had to give up his position as President of the MNSD. Hamidou Sékou acted as interim president of the party until Amadou, who was until that point the party&#x27;s Secretary-General, was elected as President of the MNSD on 21 December 2001.

While Amadou was campaigning for the July 2004 municipal elections, the helicopter in which he was travelling reportedly crashed on 14 July 2004 at Magaria in eastern Niger. Amadou survived the crash. He refused to rely on UN food aid in 2005, stating that the harvest was enough and that such aid was an insult to Niger&#x27;s dignity.

===2007 no-confidence vote===
Amadou&#x27;s government lost a no-confidence vote on 31 May 2007, with 62 deputies out of 113 deputies in favor of the motion. The vote was prompted by allegations of corruption regarding embezzled funds that had been intended for education. Although supported by the MNSD deputies, two other groups, including the CDS, joined the opposition Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS) to form a majority against the government. Amadou submitted his government&#x27;s resignation immediately afterward; he called the vote an &quot;expression of democracy&quot; while also noting that the government had survived past no-confidence votes.

As a result of the no-confidence vote, President Tandja Mamadou had the choice of naming a new prime minister or calling new elections. He named Seyni Oumarou, one of three candidates selected by parliament, as prime minister on 3 June; Oumarou had previously been part of Amadou&#x27;s government as Minister of State for Equipment.

==2008 corruption charges==
Amadou retained his post as President of MNSD-Nassara, but in 2008 faced another challenge. The Gendarmerie Nationale of Niger opened another investigation into the former prime minister, this time on charges he had embezzled 100 million CFA (Euros152,500) of foreign aid for independent press and communications development during the 2000 to 2006 period. Subsequent High Court investigations reduced the alleged amount by two-thirds. Mamadou Tandja called a special session of the National Assembly on 14 June 2008 to examine the case, as all sitting members of parliament hold immunity from prosecution. While the men had previously been close political allies, with Amadou seen as Tandja&#x27;s chosen successor, their relationship had deteriorated during Amadou&#x27;s years in office, and it was rumoured that the two had become rivals. Amadou publicly claimed that the charges were a &quot;political plot&quot; by portions of his own party. Amadou faced both a jail term and the loss of his right to hold political office in Niger if convicted.

A 14-member special panel examined the charges, and passed censure motions to the National Assembly; after over 24 hours of debate, the National Assembly voted 72 to 28 to strip Amadou of his immunity and passed the case on to the Nigerien High Court of Justice. On 26 June 2008, Amadou was arrested, and later transported to the civil prison at Koutoukaté, north of Niamey. His first appearance before the &quot;commission d&#x27;instruction&quot; of the High Court was pushed back from 29 July to 6 August 2008, at which time his request for release on bail was rejected by Bouba Mahamane, the &quot;procureur général&quot; of the High Court. In early August 2008 Zinder and Tillaberi sections of the MNSD proposed that Amadou be removed as party President. Amadou, his legal team, and his remaining supporters with the MNSD-Nassara charged the President and the government with inventing these charges to prevent Amadou from standing as a presidential candidate in the December 2009 election. They pointed to the removal of two of his political allies, Amadou Sala and Omar Hamidou Tchiana, from high political posts following Amadou&#x27;s arrest.

Thousands of Amadou supporters protested his imprisonment at a rally in Niamey on 19 October 2008. Another pro-Amadou rally was planned for 26 October, but it was banned by the authorities.

===Loss of MNSD leadership===
Due to his imprisonment, Amadou designated Habi Mahamadou Salissou, the MNSD Secretary-General, as the party&#x27;s Interim President. This decision was not accepted by Amadou&#x27;s opponents in the party, who voted to instead install Hamidou Sékou as Interim President on 7 September 2008.

Despite ongoing support for Amadou from sections of the MNSD, especially from his political base in Tillabery, Amadou was stripped of the formal leadership of the ruling party in early 2009. A special congress of the MNSD-Nassara held in Zinder on 21 February 2009 elected Prime Minister Oumarou to succeed Amadou as MNSD President. Minister of the Interior Albadé Abouba was voted Secretary-General of the party, replacing Salissou. This result came after months of wrangling between pro-Tandja and pro-Amadou elements in the party that threatened to split the MNSD and saw pro-Amadou groups join opposition protests against a floated plan to extend Tandja&#x27;s term beyond 2009.
===Illness===
Amadou was transferred from Koutoukalé prison to the National Hospital in Niamey in early March 2009, suffering from an unidentified illness, which the government stated was not life-threatening. Three weeks later, at the beginning of April, he was transferred back to prison, despite protests and a march by his supporters in Niamey, and legal action by his lawyers. Agence France-Presse reported that government medical experts brought to clear him for release back to prison had recommended he be transferred instead to a hospital in France, but were overruled. According to his wife, his poor health condition was related to low blood pressure and hypoglycaemia.

===High Court trial and return to politics===
Amadou&#x27;s lawyers announced in April 2009 that the instruction and formation of the High Court of Justice was complete and they expected a trial to commence. The High Court is a provisional institution for the trial of political figures, overseen by the Supreme Court of Niger but formed from seven sitting deputies of the National Assembly of Niger. On 23 April 2009, the High Court of Justice ordered that Amadou be conditionally released for health reasons; in accordance with the High Court&#x27;s decision, he was promptly released from prison after being detained for 10 months. Amadou complained that conditions in prison were poor and said that they should be improved.

Following his release, Amadou left Niger for medical treatment. Pointing to an inquiry that alleged Amadou held 15,000 shares in Ecobank, Nigerien authorities issued an international warrant for his arrest on 30 July 2009. Amadou spoke on Radio France Internationale on 31 July, deriding the corruption allegations as absurd: &quot;Do you think someone is capable of stealing 16 billion CFA francs from the budget of Niger? If I had stolen 16 billion then why haven&#x27;t the ministers who helped me steal it been named in the file?&quot; He also said that Tandja simply wanted him imprisoned &quot;for some reason or another&quot;.

Tandja was ousted in a February 2010 military coup, and a new junta initiated a transition to elections. Amadou returned from exile in France in March 2010 and created a new party, the Nigerien Democratic Movement (MDN). On 11 July 2010, he publicly announced his desire to stand as the MDN&#x27;s candidate for the January 2011 presidential election and vowed to &quot;fight as hard as I can to win power&quot;.

Placing third in the presidential election, Amadou then threw his support behind Mahamadou Issoufou, who had placed first. Issoufou prevailed in the second round. Amadou also won a seat in the 2011 parliamentary election, and he was elected as President of the National Assembly on 19 April 2011. The vote was nearly unanimous: there were 103 votes in favor and one vote against.

In 2013, Amadou joined the opposition to President Issoufou, although he remained in his post as President of the National Assembly. On 27 August 2014, the National Assembly&#x27;s leadership, in response to a request from the government, decided to allow the arrest of Amadou, who was not present, in connection with an investigation into an illegal network trafficking infants from Nigeria. One of his wives had already been arrested. Within hours of the decision, Amadou fled to Burkina Faso. He had denounced the investigation, and his supporters argued that constitutionally he could only be arrested if his parliamentary immunity was removed through a vote of the National Assembly as a whole.

On 24 November 2014, the National Assembly elected Amadou Salifou to replace Hama Amadou as President of the National Assembly.

===2016 presidential election===
Amadou returned to Niger on 14 November 2015, planning to stand as a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, but he was immediately arrested upon arrival at the airport in Niamey. Although he was still in jail, he was cleared to stand as a presidential candidate by the Constitutional Court in January 2016. An appeals court refused Amadou&#x27;s request to be released on 11 January. Speaking through his lawyer, Amadou said afterward that he was a political prisoner and would not pursue any further appeal.

Provisional results released on 26 February 2016 showed President Issoufou with about 48% of the vote, falling just short of a first round majority. Hama Amadou, still in jail, placed second with 17.8% of the vote. With no candidate winning an outright majority, a second round was planned to be held on 20 March 2016. Although Amadou received a much smaller percentage of the first round vote, most of the other major opposition candidates were expected to support him in the second round.

Speaking on behalf of COPA 2016, the opposition coalition supporting Amadou, Seyni Oumarou (who placed third and backed Amadou for the second round), announced on 8 March that the coalition was boycotting the vote and withdrawing its representatives from the electoral commission. Nevertheless, Amadou&#x27;s lawyer said on 11 March that he would still be a candidate.

Subsequent events were dominated by Amadou&#x27;s health problems. After a medical crisis in which he was said to have briefly lost consciousness, he was moved from the prison in Filingue to Niamey; he was then taken to Paris for treatment on 16 March. COPA again called for a boycott on 18 March.

The second round was held on 20 March 2016 amidst an opposition boycott. Given the boycott, results announced on 22 March showed an unsurprisingly large victory for President Issoufou, who was credited with 92.5% of the vote. COPA denounced the election as fraudulent and rejected the results, saying that Niger would &quot;have no legitimate president&quot; after Issoufou&#x27;s first term ended. The Niamey Court of Appeal issued an order for the &quot;provisional release&quot; of Amadou on 29 March 2016, although by that point he had already been out of the country for nearly two weeks.

A year later, on 13 March 2017, Hama Amadou was sentenced to one year in prison for his alleged involvement in the scheme to sell infants from Nigeria. Amadou remained in France and was not present. 

===2020 presidential election===
Amadou returned to Niger in 2019 and was imprisoned for eight months. He then contested the 2020–21 Nigerien general election but had his candidacy rejected. In February 2021, he was arrested for his role in unrest that followed Mohamed Bazoum&#x27;s victory in the election, but was released in April and went to France. He returned for a final time to Niger following the 2023 Nigerien coup d&#x27;état and refrained from participating in political affairs.

==Death==
Amadou died from malaria in Niamey, on 23 October 2024, at the age of 74. He was buried in his hometown of Youri on 25 October.

<text>Jean-François Ntoutoume Emane (born 6 October 1939) is a Gabonese politician who was Prime Minister of Gabon from 23 January 1999 to 20 January 2006. He was Mayor of Libreville, the capital, from 2008 to 2014.

==Life and career==
Ntoutoume Emane is a member of the Fang ethnic group from Estuaire Province. After working at the Ministry of Finance, Ntoutoume Emane was Personal Adviser to President Omar Bongo from 1976 to 1990. On 13 July 1977, he was appointed as Minister and Personal Adviser to the President, responsible for the coordination of the economic and financial affairs of the Presidency as well as civil and commercial aviation. He served as Minister of Civil and Commercial Aviation until 1984, then as Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs from 1984 to 1987. In 1990, he was elected to the National Assembly as a candidate of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG), defeating opposition leader Paul M&#x27;ba Abessole in the Libreville residential riding of Lalala. He was appointed to the government of Prime Minister Casimir Oyé-Mba on 25 March 1994 as Minister of State Control, Decentralization, Territorial Administration and Regional Integration, but he declined the position.

Ntoutoume Emane led negotiations with the opposition in 1994 that resulted in the Paris Accords. Standing as a PDG candidate in the fifth &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Libreville, he again defeated Mba Abessole in the December 1996 parliamentary election. He was appointed as Minister of State for the Land-Survey Register, Housing, Lodgings, Urban Affairs, and Spatial Planning in the government of Prime Minister Paulin Obame-Nguema on 28 January 1997. Although he had been passed over for the post of Prime Minister earlier in the 1990s, Ntoutoume Emane was appointed as prime minister in January 1999, after serving as the campaign manager for President Omar Bongo during his successful re-election campaign for the December 1998 presidential election. He won a seat from Libreville as a PDG candidate in the December 2001 parliamentary election. After seven years as prime minister, Ntoutoume Emane was replaced by Jean Eyeghe Ndong after Bongo was sworn in for another term in January 2006.

Ntoutoume Emane won a seat in the December 2006 parliamentary election, but on 31 March 2007 his victory was annulled by the Constitutional Court due to irregularities. New elections for his seat and others with invalidated results were planned, but Ntoutoume Emane decided not to participate in the re-vote, and Gisele Akoghé took his place as the PDG candidate.

In the April 2008 local elections, Ntoutoume Emane—a Vice-President of the PDG—headed the PDG list in the 5th &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Libreville, the capital. In the 5th &quot;arrondissement&quot; the PDG achieved its best result in Libreville, with 12 out of 16 councillors; however, the party fell short of an overall majority in the city with 42 out of 98 councillors. Ntoutoume Emane was presented by the PDG as its candidate for Mayor of Libreville, and on 23 May he was elected unopposed as Mayor for a five-year term. He received 84 votes; the remaining 14 votes were invalid.

At the PDG&#x27;s 9th Ordinary Congress in September 2008, Ntoutoume Emane was named as one of two Honorary Vice-Presidents of the PDG.

Reacting to the inauguration of United States President Barack Obama on 20 January 2009, Ntoutoume Emane said the event fulfilled the dream of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr., and he said that he had read Obama&#x27;s books. He expressed optimism that Obama &quot;has the ambition and potential to foster a real momentum for development&quot;.

After the death of President Bongo on 8 June 2009, Ntoutoume Emane ordered the closure of all nightclubs and bars in Libreville to reflect a spirit of national mourning.

Following local elections held in December 2013, Ntoutoume Emane was succeeded as Mayor by Rose Christiane Ossouka Raponda on 10 February 2014. He announced his resignation from the ruling PDG on 2 October 2015 and said that he was creating a new party, the Patriotic and Democratic Movement for the Refoundation of the Republic (&quot;Mouvement patriotique et démocratique pour la refondation de la République&quot;, MPDR).

<doc id="395061" wikidata="Q271966" url="?curid=395061" title="Adrian Năstase">
<text>Adrian Năstase (; born 22 June 1950) is a Romanian jurist, academic/professor, blogger, and former politician who served as the prime minister of Romania from December 2000 to December 2004.

He competed in the 2004 presidential election as the Social Democratic Party (PSD) candidate, but was defeated by the centre-right Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) candidate Traian Băsescu who pertained at that time to the Democratic Party (PD).

He was the president of the Chamber of Deputies from 21 December 2004 until 15 March 2006, when he resigned due to corruption charges. Sentenced to two years in prison in July 2012, he attempted suicide before beginning his term in the penitentiary. Released in March 2013, he was sentenced to four years in another case in January 2014, but released that August.

A controversial figure due to the corruption scandals in which he was involved, Năstase is still regarded by both admirers and rivals (including his archrival Traian Băsescu), as the best and most efficient Romanian post-communist Prime Minister, being praised for his efforts of Euro-Atlantic integration of Romania and for the stabilization and modernization of the Romanian economy.

==Biography==

===Family background===

Năstase was born in Bucharest to a family that originated from Hanul de Pământ village, Tărtășești commune, Dâmbovița County. His father, Marian Năstase, was an officer of the Royal Romanian Army. His mother is named Elena and he has a sister, Dana Barb (&quot;née&quot; Năstase).

===Youth period===
Adrian Năstase finished high school at Nicolae Bălcescu High School (now Saint Sava National College) and then graduated from the University of Bucharest, receiving degrees from both the Department of Law and the Department of Sociology. He worked at various times as a professor, judge, and as president of several organizations involved with law and international relations.

On 31 July 1985, he married Dana Miculescu, the daughter of . They have two sons, Andrei (b. 12 February 1986) and Mihnea (b. 23 June 1993).

===Post-1989 political career===
Năstase was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Romania as member of the National Salvation Front party on 9 June 1990 and served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the governments of Petre Roman and Theodor Stolojan (28 June 1990 – 16 October 1992).

In 1992, he was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a member of the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN) and served as the president of the Chamber of Deputies. Between 1993 and 1997, he was also the executive president of the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR, formerly the FDSN).

When the PDSR lost the 1996 elections, Năstase became leader of the opposition PDSR parliamentary group, vice-president of Chamber of Deputies, and member of Standing Bureau and Member of the Romanian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe where he was the Recording Secretary of Council of Europe commission on judicial problems and human rights with reference to illegal activities by religious sects.

After the victory of the PDSR in the 2000 legislative elections and the re-election of Ion Iliescu as president of Romania, Năstase was elected president of the PDSR, which soon changed its name to the Social Democratic Party (PSD) after merging with another party. Năstase remained PSD president until April 2005 when he was replaced by former foreign minister Mircea Geoană at a party congress. At the same congress, Năstase was elected to be PSD executive president, the second most senior position in the party.

===Term as Prime Minister of Romania===
Năstase was confirmed by the Parliament as prime minister on 28 December 2000, following his appointment to the position in days before by President Ion Iliescu. He held the position concurrently with his leadership of the PSD. His four years as prime minister were characterized by unprecedented political stability in post-communist Romania, continuous economic growth, and a foreign policy strongly oriented toward the West, although during 2001, the press and some of the political opposition questioned this in light of his close association with former Securitate agent Ristea Priboi. Romania joined NATO, and committed Romanian troops in support of international efforts in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

His government completed accession negotiations with the European Union (EU) and aggressively passed legislation and implemented a number of reforms required for EU accession, which was subsequently completed with the 2007 enlargement of the European Union. His government successfully negotiated the lifting of visa restrictions on Romanians traveling to EU Schengen treaty countries.

Inflation decreased and the Romanian leu became stronger. However, critics pointed out that this was at least partially due to an influx of foreign currency into Romania from the estimated two million Romanians working abroad. GDP also grew substantially during each year of his term, with a growth of 8.3% achieved in 2004, the highest in the region. Average wages similarly grew, although they did not match the pace of economic growth. For example, in 2004 wages grew by 10.4%, with a 9.2% inflation rate, thereby leading to a real wage growth of 1.2%, in a year when GDP grew by 7%.

The Năstase government did not make substantial inroads on a number of important issues in Romanian society, such as agricultural policy: about 42% of Romanians continued to work in agriculture (compared to 3% of French and 19% of Poles). Critics also pointed out that economic growth was not evenly distributed among the social classes, and the percentage of people living below the poverty level remained high, especially in the rural areas.

Although the government took initial steps toward meaningful judicial reform, the government was repeatedly criticized, including by the EU, for failing to combat substantially widespread corruption, including at the highest levels.

In 2002, Năstase was appointed a Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania, which was revoked in December 2019 because of his double criminal indictment.

===2004 presidential candidacy===
The 2004 presidential election cycle marked the end of the second term of President Ion Iliescu, who, according to the constitution, could not serve another term. The PSD selected Năstase to be its presidential candidate. His running mate (selected to be prime minister in the event of a Năstase win) was then Foreign Minister Mircea Geoană.

Throughout the autumn of 2004, opinion polls predicted Năstase would win, boosted in areas and among sectors where the PSD traditionally received strong support: in rural areas, in small and medium-sized towns in the south and east of the country, and among pensioners and labor groups. The PSD, which remained by far the largest single political party in the country, was also expected to rely on its network of local party organizations to ensure voters came to the polls.

Năstase was ahead by a substantial margin during 28 November first round of the presidential elections, although he received less than 50 percent of the vote, and therefore was required to compete in a 12 December run-off election against second place center-right Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) candidate Traian Băsescu. Independent civil society organizations alleged incidents of fraud in Năstase&#x27;s favor during the first round of the elections, including alleged multiple voting by PSD supporters as a result of poor controls on voter identification and flaws in the electronic vote tabulation.

At the time the polls closed on the evening of the run-off election, major media outlets released the results of exit polls showing a tie between Năstase and Băsescu. Nonetheless, Băsescu and his supporters interpreted the results as clear indication of a victory. Tens of thousands of Băsescu&#x27;s supporters converged on University Square in the center of Bucharest, and in other parts of the country, to celebrate his presumed victory. The next morning, authorities released figures confirming Băsescu&#x27;s win. Năstase received only 48.77% of the total vote.

Năstase later attributed his surprise defeat to a number of factors, including what he characterized as a failure of Humanist Party (PC) politicians to campaign on his behalf (the Humanist Party had an electoral pact with the PSD at that time); and the endorsement of Băsescu by Greater Romania Party (PRM) leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Other likely factors include Băsescu&#x27;s strong performance during the second presidential debate, as well as persistent allegations of corruption against Năstase and the PSD.

Despite Năstase&#x27;s presidential defeat, the PSD still won the largest bloc of seats in the Parliament in the concurrent legislative elections. Following the elections and in the interim period before Băsescu&#x27;s DA Alliance was able to form a coalition majority, the PSD succeeded in obtaining sufficient support within the parliament to elect Năstase as president of the Chamber of Deputies. Former PSD Prime Minister Nicolae Văcăroiu was elected president of the Senate in the same circumstances. Năstase resigned as prime minister the day after Băsescu&#x27;s inauguration. Later on, at the request of Cozmin Gușă, the campaign manager of Traian Băsescu, who resigned from Băsescu&#x27;s party after he got elected, requested the release of the official results regarding the alleged fraud of the 2004 elections. The investigation concluded that there were no hard evidence of this fraud and that the elected president, Traian Băsescu, had no proofs to make that statement. The accusation of stealing the elections heavily helped Băsescu win the elections, some political analysts argue.
=== Corruption trial, sentence and attempted suicide ===
On 30 January 2012, the courts gave Năstase a two-year prison sentence for misuse of a publicly funded conference to raise cash for his unsuccessful campaign in 2004. Năstase claimed the sentence was influenced by rival politician Traian Băsescu, at the time President of Romania, and indicated that if necessary, he would take his case to the European Court of Human Rights. Responding to the allegations, Băsescu denied the charges were political in nature and claimed they stemmed from denunciations made by members of Năstase&#x27;s party.

Adrian Năstase was convicted of corruption charges on 20 June 2012 and sentenced to a 2-year imprisonment term. At the time when the sentence was pronounced, he was the only head of government sentenced to prison in the 23 years following the Romanian Revolution.

When the police arrived at his home to arrest Năstase, he shot himself in the throat in an apparent suicide attempt and was taken to a hospital. Many people now believe that this apparent suicide was in fact a final botched attempt on his part to evade justice. On that night he was removed by ambulance with a Burberry scarf draped about his neck thus hiding any evidence of serious injury from gathered reporters. After receiving treatment during a six-day period, he was moved to Rahova prison and then transferred to Jilava prison on medical grounds, to be treated for his diabetes and heart condition.

In January 2014, the Romanian Supreme Court sentenced him to a four-year prison sentence for taking bribes and a three-year prison sentence for blackmail, to run concurrently. As a result, Năstase lost his status as a professor. He was eventually released later the same year, and in December 2021, 7 years later, the Romanian Supreme Court accepted Năstase&#x27;s request for judicial rehabilitation with respect to the two sentences, after multiple prior attempts. If the decision remains final, Năstase will be once again able to exercise his right to vote and be elected to public office.

=== Post premiership ===
In recent years, Năstase advises officials regarding state affairs and international relations, including solving bilateral conflicts and strengthening diplomatic and economic ties between countries and organizations.

<text>Martha Beatriz Merino Lucero (born November 15, 1947) is a Peruvian lawyer, academic and politician who served as the first female Prime Minister of Peru, in 2003. She previously served as Senator and Congresswoman from 1990 until 2000. Following her tenure in Alejandro Toledo&#x27;s cabinet, Merino was appointed by the Peruvian Congress as the national ombudswoman for Peru, serving from 2005 to 2011, a position officially known as the &quot;Public Defender&quot;, being the second to hold the position.

Prominently a female leading persona in Peru, Merino is currently a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally, for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

==Early life and education==
Martha Beatriz Merino Lucero was born on November 15, 1947, in Lima, Peru. Her father, Augusto Merino Abrego (1915–2015), was a decorated public servant, serving as Treasurer and Finance Director of the San Isidro municipality. Throughout her career and in various interviews offered to the media, Merino highlighted the influence of her father on her professional development. Her mother was Aída Lucero (1916-2013).

After finishing high school at the Parochial School of Santa Rosa of Lince, Merino enrolled in the National University of San Marcos. Graduating a with law degree in 1970, she was awarded a scholarship in order to attend the London School of Economics graduate program, where she would attain a Master of Laws (LL.M.) in tax law in 1972. Relocating to the United States, she pursued a second Master of Laws at Harvard University with a Fulbright scholarship, becoming the first Peruvian woman to graduate from Harvard Law School, in 1977.

==Career==
Following her graduation from Harvard, Merino pursued a career at Procter &amp; Gamble, serving as Legal, Commercial, International, Environment and Corporate Manager. She held the positions in Lima, Caracas (Latin America headquarters) and Cincinnati (world headquarters). She was also the director of Procter &amp; Gamble for Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia and Colombia, from January 1979 to November 1989, and from July 1992 to December 1994.

In 1989, Mario Vargas Llosa invited her to run for the Peruvian Senate in the 1990 general election. Running as part of the Democratic Front (FREDEMO) coalition, she was ultimately elected along twenty other candidates from the Christian People&#x27;s Party and Popular Action (Peru), being herself a member of the Liberty Movement.

During her time as a Senator, she presided over the Environment, Ecology and Amazon Committee and the Women&#x27;s Rights Committee. Her tenure would be cut-short on April 5, 1992, as president Alberto Fujimori dissolved congress with a self-coup. She would return to the newly inaugurated unicameral Congress in 1995, running as an independent within the Independent Moralizing Front, led by Fernando Olivera. She would serve as a staunch opposition member in Congress, leading numerous bills against the Fujimori regime.

In 1993, Merino founded the Merino &amp; Reaño Law Firm, where she worked extensively in commercial, labor, corporate and environmental legislation. She was senior partner from 1993 to 2001.

Approaching the 2000 general election, mayor Alberto Andrade of Lima invited Merino as his second running mate for the We Are Peru nomination, alongside Luis Guerrero as first running mate. Despite favorable polling numbers at the start of the race, the government&#x27;s machinations led by National Intelligence Service ran a smear campaign against Andrade, ultimately destroying his chances in the general election.

Following Fujimori&#x27;s downfall in late 2000, Merino was appointed Superintendent of the Peruvian Internal Revenue Service, serving from 2001 to 2003. During her two-year tenure, she directed the master&#x27;s degree program in taxation and fiscal policy at the University of Lima.

===Prime Minister of Peru (2003)===
Merino became the President of the Council of Ministers on June 23, 2003, the highest political rank ever held by a woman in the history of Peru, appointed by president Alejandro Toledo. During her brief premiership, she led a successful tax reform bill, and laid over a modernizing restructuring process of the Peruvian government.

On July 18, 2003, she appeared before Congress in order present the general policy of the government and request the confidence vote. Merino referred to the government&#x27;s economic policy and promotion of economic development and employment. Merino received confirmation of Congress with 61 votes in favor, 1 against and 17 abstentions.

Her management was characterized by lifting the Toledo regime&#x27;s approval ratings; however, she resigned on December 15, 2003, at the request of Toledo, citing differences in policy management.

In early December 2003, a television program questioned Merino about an alleged influence peddling to favor friends and family during her time as Superintendent at the Peruvian Internal Revenue Service (SUNAT). Given this, in an appearance before the local press denied that she had influenced the hiring for her friends. After that, Merino traveled to the United States for academic conferences.

On December 13, president Toledo asked for the resignation of all his ministers and the 7 presidential advisers.

Upon her return to Lima, Merino explained to the press that she had resigned from the office of Prime Minister on the first day of December and that President Toledo asked her to stay a while longer until he found a successor. She also commented that she was summoned in October by a senior dignitary of the Catholic Church, who informed her that a political leader made accusations against her and questioned her moral integrity. She was succeeded in the premiership by Carlos Ferrero, a prominent member of Possible Peru and three-year president of Congress.

===Public Defender (2005–2011)===
After stepping down as Prime Minister, Merino held high approval ratings as a public persona. While On September 29, 2005, Congress elected her as the second Public Defender of Peru, succeeding the acting holder, Walter Albán. Congress had been unable to appoint a new holder since the expiration of Jorge Santistevan de Noriega&#x27;s term in 2000. She was nominated by the National Unity parliamentary bench. Until her election as Defender, she served at the World Bank as Senior Specialist in the Public Sector area, in charge of issues related to Tax Administration and Policy, Modernization of the State and Strengthening of Congresses for Latin America.

During her term as Public Defender, she successfully called for the release of peasants from Chaca (Ayacucho) unfairly accused of terrorism, raised the inquiry on the creation of the Ministry of the Environment (2008), recommended the reform of the Pension Standardization Office (2008–2009), took over the Vilma Palma Case achieving a first sentence for discrimination in Peru (2009), and contributed in the Prior Consultation Law (2009). Overall, she has been cited for contributing to the restoration of peace and the restitution of the affected rights of the most vulnerable sectors of the Peruvian population.

===Later career (2011–2015)===
Her term in the Office of the Public Defender expired in 2010, but she remained in office until she tendered her resignation on March 30, 2011, being succeeded by Eduardo Luna Vega, who served as acting defender until the election of Walter Gutiérrez Camacho en 2016. Following her resignation, she was appointed Chairwoman of the Public Pension&#x27;s Administrators Association. She stepped down on January 16, 2012. During her time in office, she contributed to the expansion of knowledge of the private pension&#x27;s system throughout the country, taking over the initiative of improving the benefits of affiliated members.

In November 2011, she was appointed director of the Center for Social Responsibility, Entrepreneurship and Sustainability of CENTRUM, renowned business school of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. She stepped down from the academic post in November 2015. Conjointly, she served as Chairwoman of the National Hydrocarbons Society, from January 2013 to December 2015.

Merino is part of the Advanced Leadership Initiative at Harvard University.

=== César Vallejo University controversies (2016–present) ===
Academically, she currently serves as executive president of the César Vallejo University since February 8, 2016, appointed by then-presidential nominee César Acuña Peralta, who has allegedly committed plagiarism in his doctoral dissertation and has been involved in several cases of money laundering. Following these allegations, Francisco Miró Quesada Rada resigned as executive president, due in particular to the plagiarism allegations against Acuña in the middle of the presidential campaign. 

Under Merino&#x27;s leadership, the university formally implemented the Turnitin plagiarism detection service. Before, there was no plagiarism detection service available at the university, being among the plagiarizers future Peruvian president Pedro Castillo and first lady, Lilia Paredes, both graduate students of the same university back in 2012. Recently, Gavin Jones scientist of the United States Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station denounced that two undergraduate thesis students also plagiarized an academic article of his.

She was the first woman in the Bahamas to hold this office, from 1 January 2002 (on an acting basis since 13 November 2001) until 30 November 2005. She previously served as Minister of Education from 1995 to 2001.

==Early life==
Turnquest was born on 2 October 1930, at Roses on Long Island in the Bahamas. After completing her elementary education in Roses and Buckleys settlements on Long Island, she continued her schooling at the Government High School on New Providence. Attaining her Cambridge Junior Certificate in 1946 and her Cambridge Senior Certificate in 1947, Turnquest graduated in 1948. She furthered her studies at the Bahamas Teachers’ Training College earning her training teaching certificate in 1951. Around this same time, Turnquest married Reginald Dumont (1920 – 17 December 2011) a Guyanese immigrant who was working for the Bahamas Police Force on 24 August 1951. She began working for the Ministry of Education and Culture as a student teacher and earned her full teaching certificate in 1954.

==Career==
Upon receipt of her credentials, Dumont started her career as a classroom teacher. In 1962 and 1963, she studied in the United States as a Fulbright scholar and then in 1965, earned a General Certificate of Education from the Teachers&#x27; Union Institute. From 1968 to 1970, Dumont attended the University of Miami, graduating with her bachelor&#x27;s degree in education. Appointed as head teacher at that time, Dumont then moving into administration, serving as education officer and as deputy director of education, before completing her education career after 21 years in 1975.

Dumont then began working as the deputy permanent secretary of the Ministry of Works and Utilities in 1975. She continued her own education and enrolled at Nova University in 1976. Dumont graduated with a doctorate in public administration in 1978 and that same year left the Ministry of Works and began working for Roywest Trust Corporation/Nat West International Trust Holdings Limited as a training officer. She remained with Nat West for the next thirteen years, serving as an assistant manager, then personnel manager and group relations manager, before retiring in 1991.

In 1992, Dumont was appointed to the Senate as a representative of the Free National Movement (FNM). Simultaneously, she was promoted to the cabinet by Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham, to serve as Minister of Health and Environment. She held this post until 1995, when she was moved to the Ministry of Education and Training. That ministry and Dumont&#x27;s post transitioned to the Ministry of Education in 1997. She retired from the cabinet in 2000, but retained her Senate seat. In 2001, when Sir Orville Turnquest resigned as Governor-General to facilitate his son Tommy Turnquest&#x27;s run for party leadership the following year, Dumont was selected as his interim replacement on 13 November 2001. She was confirmed as the permanent Governor-General on 1 January 2002, becoming the first woman to hold the post. She resigned from the post on 30 November 2005 and the following day was feted with a farewell ceremony commemorating her fifty-eight years in public service.

In 2007, the University of the West Indies conferred an honorary doctor of laws degree upon Dumont. After leaving public service, Dumont wrote her autobiography, &quot;Roses to Mount Fitzwilliam&quot; and remained active, speaking to public schools and encouraging youth to further their education.
