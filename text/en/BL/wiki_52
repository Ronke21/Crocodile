<text>Ernest Bevin (9 March 1881 – 14 April 1951) was a British statesman, trade union leader and Labour Party politician. He cofounded and served as General Secretary of the powerful Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union from 1922 to 1940 and served as Minister of Labour and National Service in the wartime coalition government. He succeeded in maximising the British labour supply for both the armed services and domestic industrial production with a minimum of strikes and disruption.

His most important role came as Foreign Secretary in the post-war Labour government, 1945–1951. He secured Marshall Aid, strongly opposed communism and was the main drive behind the creation of NATO. Bevin was also instrumental to the founding of the Information Research Department (IRD), a secret propaganda wing of the British Foreign Office, which specialised in disinformation, anti-communism and pro-colonial propaganda. Bevin played an important role in the end of the Mandate of Palestine and was strongly opposed to the establishment of the State of Israel. His biographer Alan Bullock said that Bevin &quot;stands as the last of the line of foreign secretaries in the tradition created by Castlereagh, Canning and Palmerston in the first half of the 19th century&quot;.

==Early life==

Bevin was born in the village of Winsford in Somerset, England, to Diana Bevin, who since 1877 had described herself as a widow. His father is unknown. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1889, the young Bevin lived with his half-sister&#x27;s family and moved to Copplestone in Devon. He had little formal education; he had briefly attended two village schools and then Hayward&#x27;s School, Crediton, starting in 1890 and leaving in 1892.

He later recalled being asked as a child to read the newspaper aloud for the benefit of adults in his family who were illiterate. At the age of eleven, he went to work as a labourer, then as a lorry driver in Bristol, where he joined the Bristol Socialist Society. In 1910 he became secretary of the Bristol branch of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers&#x27; Union, and in 1914 he became a national organiser for the union.

Bevin was a large, strong man, and by the time of his political prominence, he was very heavy. He spoke with such a strong West Country accent that on one occasion, listeners at Cabinet had difficulty in deciding whether he was talking about &quot;Hugh and Nye (Gaitskell and Bevan)&quot; or &quot;you and I&quot;. He had developed his oratorical skills from his time as a Baptist lay preacher, which he had given up as a profession to become a full-time labour activist.

Bevin married Florence Townley, daughter of a wine taster at a Bristol wine merchants. They had one child, a daughter, Queenie Mildred Wynne (6 May 1911 – 31 January 2000). Florence Bevin (died 1968) was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1952.

==Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union==
In 1922, Bevin was one of the founding leaders of the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (TGWU), which soon became Britain&#x27;s largest trade union. Upon his election as the union&#x27;s General Secretary, he became one of the country&#x27;s leading labour leaders and the strongest union advocate within the Labour Party. Politically, he was on the right wing of the Labour Party. He was strongly opposed to communism and direct action. His opponents claimed that was partly because of antisemitic paranoia, which made him see communism as a &quot;Jewish plot&quot; against Britain. He took part in the British General Strike in 1926 but without enthusiasm.

Bevin had no great faith in parliamentary politics but had nevertheless been a member of the Labour Party from the time of its formation, and he unsuccessfully fought Bristol Central at the 1918 general election. He was defeated by the Coalition Conservative Thomas Inskip. He had poor relations with the first Labour Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, and was not surprised when MacDonald formed a National Government with the Conservatives during the economic crisis of 1931 for which MacDonald was expelled from the Labour Party.

At the 1931 general election, Bevin was persuaded by the remaining leaders of the Labour Party to contest Gateshead on the understanding that if successful he would remain as general secretary of the TGWU. The National Government won a landslide, which resulted in Gateshead being lost by a large margin to the Liberal National Thomas Magnay.

Bevin was a trade unionist who believed in getting material benefits for his members through direct negotiations with strike action to be used as a last resort. During the late 1930s, for instance, Bevin helped to instigate a successful campaign by the Trades Union Congress to extend paid holidays to a wider proportion of the workforce. That culminated in the Holidays with Pay Act 1938, which extended entitlement to paid holidays to about 11 million workers by June 1939.

==Foreign policy interests==
During the 1930s, with the Labour Party split and weakened, Bevin co-operated with the Conservative-dominated National Government on practical issues, but during that period, he became increasingly involved in foreign policy. He was a firm opponent of fascism and of the British appeasement of the fascist powers. In 1935, arguing that Fascist Italy should be punished by sanctions for its recent invasion of Abyssinia, he made a blistering attack on the pacifists in the Labour Party and accused the Labour leader George Lansbury at the Party Conference of &quot;hawking his conscience around&quot; and of asking to be told what to do with it. Bevin&#x27;s efforts to promote sanctions were successful, with an overwhelming majority of delegates voting in favour of sanctions.

After the vote at the conference, Lansbury resigned and was replaced as leader by his deputy, Clement Attlee, who, along with Lansbury and Stafford Cripps, had been one of only three former Labour Ministers to be re-elected under that party label at the 1931 general election. After the November 1935 general election, Herbert Morrison, who was newly returned to Parliament, challenged Attlee for the leadership but was defeated. In later years, Bevin gave Attlee, whom he privately referred to as &quot;little Clem&quot;, staunch support, especially in 1947, when Morrison and Cripps led further intrigue against Attlee.

Bevin was a member of the British delegation to the second British Commonwealth Relations conference. It was held at Lapstone, Sydney, Australia in 1938 organised by Chatham House and the Australian Institute of International Affairs with delegations from all the then existing Commonwealth countries.

==Wartime Minister of Labour==

In 1940, Winston Churchill formed an all-party coalition government to run the country during the Second World War. Churchill was impressed by Bevin&#x27;s opposition to trade union pacifism and by his appetite for work (according to Churchill, Bevin was by &quot;far the most distinguished man that the Labour Party have thrown up in my time&quot;). He appointed Bevin to the position of Minister of Labour and National Service. As Bevin was not actually an MP at the time, to remove the resulting constitutional anomaly, a parliamentary position was hurriedly found for him, and Bevin was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for the London constituency of Wandsworth Central.

The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939 gave Bevin complete control over the labour force and the allocation of manpower, and he was determined to use the unprecedented authority not just to help win the war but also to strengthen the bargaining position of trade unions in the postwar future. Bevin once quipped: &quot;They say Gladstone was at the Treasury from 1860 until 1930. I&#x27;m going to be at the Ministry of Labour from 1940 until 1990,&quot; suggesting he aspired to have his doctrines remain at the Ministry of Labour as long as Gladstone&#x27;s economic policies had governed the Treasury&#x27;s approach. The industrial settlement he introduced remained largely unaltered by successive postwar administrations until the reforms of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government in the early 1980s.

During the war, Bevin was responsible for diverting nearly 48,000 military conscripts to work in the coal industry (the workers became known as the Bevin Boys), and he used his position to secure significant improvements in wages and working conditions for the working class. He also drew up the demobilisation scheme that ultimately returned millions of military personnel and civilian war workers into the peacetime economy. Bevin remained Minister of Labour until 1945 when Labour left the Coalition government. On VE Day, he stood next to Churchill in looking down on the crowd on Whitehall.

==Foreign Secretary==
After the 1945 general election, Attlee had it in mind to appoint Bevin as Chancellor and Hugh Dalton as Foreign Secretary, but ultimately changed his mind and swapped them round. One of the reasons may well have been the poor relations which existed between Bevin and Herbert Morrison, who was scheduled to play a leading role in Labour domestic policy.

Diplomats were then recruited from public schools, and it was said of Bevin that it was hard to imagine him filling any other job in the Foreign Office except perhaps that of an old and truculent lift attendant. In praise of Bevin, his Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office, Alexander Cadogan, wrote, &quot;He knows a great deal, is prepared to read any amount, seems to take in what he does read, and is capable of making up his own mind and sticking up for his (and our) point of view against anyone&quot;. An alternative view is offered by Charmley, who writes that Bevin read and wrote with some difficulty and that examination of Foreign Office documents shows little sign of the frequent annotations made by Anthony Eden. That suggests that Bevin preferred to reach most of his decisions after oral discussion with his advisers.

However, Charmley dismisses the concerns of contemporaries such as Charles Webster and Lord Cecil of Chelwood that Bevin, a man of very strong personality, was &quot;in the hands of his officials&quot;. Charmley argues that much of Bevin&#x27;s success came because he shared the views of those officials. His earlier career had left him with an intense dislike of communists, whom he regarded as workshy intellectuals whose attempts to infiltrate trade unions were to be resisted. His former Private Secretary, Oliver Harvey, thought Bevin&#x27;s staunchly anti-Soviet policy was what Eden&#x27;s would have been had he not been hamstrung by the Potsdam Conference and Churchill&#x27;s occasional susceptibility to Stalin&#x27;s flattery, and Cadogan thought Bevin to be &quot;pretty sound on the whole&quot;.

According to Geoffrey Warner:
:Bevin&#x27;s personality was a strange mixture of Jekyll and Hyde. He was adored by his officials, not only because there was never any doubt that foreign policy was made in the Foreign Office while he was its head, but also because he was as solicitous of their welfare and conditions of employment as he had been of those of his union members. His word was universally regarded as his bond and his loyalty once given was unstinting. At the same time, as even his admirers have conceded, he was long-winded, vain, vindictive, profoundly suspicious, and prejudiced against—among others and in no particular order—Jews, Germans, Roman Catholics, and intellectuals of all kinds, groups that, when taken together, comprised a large proportion of those with whom he had to deal.

===United States===
The historian Martin H. Folly argues that Bevin was not automatically pro-American. Instead, he pushed his embassy in Washington to project a view of Britain that neutralised American criticisms. He felt that Britain&#x27;s problems were in part caused by American irresponsibility. He was frustrated with American attitudes. His strategy was to bring Washington around to support Britain&#x27;s policies and argued that Britain had earned American support and ought to compensate it for its sacrifices against the Nazis. Folly considers that Bevin was not coldly pragmatic uncritically pro-American or a puppet manipulated by the British Foreign Office.

Bevin&#x27;s complex position on the US is betrayed in the following quotation, which was given in response to an American visitor who asked Bevin why he had a portrait of George III behind his desk: &quot;[He&#x27;s] my hero. If he hadn&#x27;t been so stupid, you wouldn&#x27;t have been strong enough to come to our rescue in the War.&quot;

===Finances===
In 1945, Britain was virtually bankrupt as a result of the war but was still maintaining a huge air force and conscript army in an attempt to remain a global power. Bevin played a key role in securing the low-interest $3.75 billion Anglo-American loan as the only real alternative to national bankruptcy. He had asked originally for $5 billion.

The cost of rebuilding necessitated austerity at home to maximise export earnings while Britain&#x27;s colonies and other client states were required to keep their reserves in pounds as &quot;sterling balances&quot;. Additional funds, which did not have to be repaid, came from the Marshall Plan in 1948 to 1950, which also required Britain to modernise its business practices and to remove trade barriers.

===Europe===
Bevin looked for ways to bring Western Europe together in a military alliance at the beginning of the Cold War. One early attempt was the Dunkirk Treaty with France in 1947. His commitment to the West European security system made him eager to sign the Treaty of Brussels in 1948. It drew Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg into an arrangement for collective security and opened the way for the formation of NATO in 1949. NATO was primarily aimed as a defensive measure against Soviet expansion, but it also helped bring its members closer together, enabled them to modernise their forces along parallel lines and encouraged arms purchases from Britain. Bevin was also instrumental in the creation of the Council of Europe, with the signature of its Statute on 5 May 1949, at St James&#x27;s Palace, London, by the Foreign Ministers of Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Britain was still closely allied to France, and both countries continued to be treated as major partners at international summits alongside the Americans and the Soviets until 1960. Broadly speaking, they remained Britain&#x27;s foreign policy until the late 1950s, when the humiliation of the 1956 Suez Crisis and the economic revival of Continental Europe, much of which was now united as the &quot;Common Market&quot;, caused a reappraisal.

===Empire===

Bevin was unsentimental about the British Empire in places for which the growth of nationalism had made direct rule no longer practicable. He was part of the Cabinet that approved a speedy British withdrawal from India in 1947 and neighbouring colonies. However, Britain still maintained a network of client states in the Middle East (Egypt until 1952, Iraq and Jordan until 1959) and major bases in such places as Cyprus and Suez (until 1956) and expected to remain in control of parts of Africa for many more years. Bevin approved the construction of a huge new base in East Africa. Bevin wrote that, &quot;We have the material resources in the Colonial Empire, if we develop them, and by giving a spiritual lead now, we should be able to carry out our task in a way which will show clearly that we are not subservient to the United States of America or to the Soviet Union.&quot; Colonial exports then earned $150 million a year, mostly Malayan rubber, West African cocoa, and sugar and sisal from the West Indies. By the end of 1948, colonial exports were 50% higher than before the war, and in the first half of 1948, colonial exports accounted for 10.4% of Britain&#x27;s imports. After the war, Britain helped France and the Netherlands recover their Far Eastern colonies in the French Indochina and Dutch East Indies in the hope that could lead towards the formation of a third superpower bloc. Bevin agreed with Duff Cooper, the British Ambassador in Paris, that the Dunkirk Treaty would be a step in this direction and thought that Eden&#x27;s objection in 1944, when Cooper first proposed it, that such moves might alienate the Soviets no longer applied.

In December 1947, Bevin hoped (in vain) that the US would support Britain&#x27;s &quot;strategic, political and economic position in the Middle East&quot;. In May 1950 Bevin told the London meeting of foreign ministers that &quot;the United States authorities had recently seemed disposed to press us to adopt a greater measure of economic integration with Europe than we thought wise.&quot; He was referring to the Schuman Plan to set up the European Coal and Steel Community. In May 1950, he said that because of links with the US and the Commonwealth, Britain was &quot;different in character from other European nations and fundamentally incapable of wholehearted integration with them.&quot;

===Cold War===
Bevin remained a determined anti-Communist and anti-Soviet. In 1946 during a conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov repeatedly attacked British proposals and defended Soviet policies, and in total frustration, Bevin stood, lurched towards the minister and shouted, &quot;I&#x27;ve had enough of this I &#x27;ave!&quot; He was then restrained by security.

He strongly encouraged the United States to take a vigorously anti-Communist foreign policy in the early years of the Cold War. He was a leading advocate for British combat operations in the Korean War. Two of the key institutions of the postwar world, NATO and the Marshall Plan, for aid to postwar Europe, were in considerable part the result of Bevin&#x27;s efforts during these years. The policy, which was little different from that of the Conservatives (&quot;Hasn&#x27;t Anthony Eden grown fat?&quot; as wags had it), was a source of frustration to some backbench Labour MPs, who early in the 1945 Parliament formed a &quot;Keep Left&quot; group to push for a more left-wing foreign policy.

In 1945, Bevin advocated the creation of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly and said in the House of Commons, &quot;There should be a study of a house directly elected by the people of the world to whom the nations are accountable&quot;.

In 1950, Bevin offered recognition to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Atomic bomb===
Attlee and Bevin worked together on the decision to produce a British atomic bomb despite intense opposition from pro-Soviet elements of the Labour Party, groups that Bevin detested. The decision was taken in secret by a small Cabinet committee. Bevin told the committee in October 1946, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to have this thing over here whatever it costs... We&#x27;ve got to have the bloody Union Jack flying on top of it&quot;. It was a matter of both prestige and national security. Those ministers who would have opposed the bomb on grounds of cost, Hugh Dalton and Sir Stafford Cripps, were excluded from the meeting in January 1947 at which the final decision was taken.

===Palestine and Israel===

Bevin was Foreign Secretary during the period when the Mandate for Palestine ended, and the State of Israel was created. In 1944, for the upcoming 1945 United Kingdom general election, the Labour Party had issued a statement pledging to revoke the White Paper of 1939, permit free Jewish immigration to Palestine and turn Palestine into a Jewish state. It had even advocated the population transfers of Arabs and called for the expansion of a future Jewish state&#x27;s borders into Transjordan, Egypt, and/or Syria. However, in office, Bevin maintained the immigration restrictions. Wanting to protect British hegemony in the Middle East, he broke the party&#x27;s promise and instead sought to follow through on the terms of White Paper. While acting mainly out of pragmatism, Bevin was an ideological anti-Zionist who believed that the Balfour Declaration had been a mistake and was concerned that a Jewish state would become a &quot;racial state&quot;. His policies would spark a direct confrontation between British security forces and Zionist paramilitaries in Palestine. Bevin later told David Ben-Gurion that the Balfour Declaration had been the worst Western foreign policy blunder in the first half of the 20th-century.

Bevin&#x27;s stance on Palestine infuriated some members of his party. Party chairman Harold Laski denounced Bevin as &quot;an outrageous blot on the whole Labour movement.&quot; Richard Crossman, a pro-Zionist Labour MP who knew Bevin, said the war was fueled almost entirely by &quot;one man&#x27;s determination to teach the Jews a lesson.&quot; However, Bevin&#x27;s actions were backed by Attlee, who opposed the establishment of a Jewish state on the grounds it would jeopardise Britain&#x27;s position as the dominant power in the Middle East.

Bevin failed to secure the stated British objectives in that area of foreign policy, which included a peaceful settlement of the situation and the avoidance of involuntary population transfers. Regarding Bevin&#x27;s handling of the Middle East situation, at least one commentator, David Leitch, has suggested that Bevin lacked diplomatic finesse.

Leitch argued that Bevin tended to make a bad situation worse by making ill-chosen abrasive remarks. Bevin, undeniably a plain-spoken man, made some remarks that struck some as insensitive. Critics have accused him of being antisemitic. One remark which caused particular anger was made when U.S. President Harry Truman was pressing Britain to immediately admit 100,000 Jewish refugees, survivors of the Holocaust who wanted to immigrate to Palestine. Bevin, who refused to accept this request unless Truman sent American troops to Palestine, told a Labour Party meeting the reasons that he thought were behind the American pressure: pressure was being applied because &quot;There has been agitation in the United States, and particularly in New York, for 100,000 Jews to be put in Palestine. I hope I will not be misunderstood in America if I say that this was proposed by the purest of motives. They did not want too many Jews in New York.&quot; He was merely restating what he said had been told to him by James F. Byrnes, the US Secretary of State.

For refusing to remove limits on Jewish immigration to Palestine in the aftermath of the war, Bevin earned the hatred of Zionists. According to the historian Howard Sachar, his political foe, Richard Crossman, a pro-Zionist member of the postwar Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into the Problems of European Jewry and Palestine, characterised his outlook during the dying days of the Mandate as &quot;corresponding roughly with &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;&quot;, a tsarist fabrication written to inflame antisemitic prejudice. In Sachar&#x27;s account, Crossman intimated that &quot;the main points of Bevin&#x27;s discourse were... that the Jews had successfully organised a conspiracy against Britain and against him personally&quot;. Bevin&#x27;s biographer Alan Bullock rejected suggestions that Bevin was motivated by personal antisemitism.
Britain&#x27;s economic weakness and its dependence on the financial support of the United States (Britain had received a large American loan in 1946, and the Marshall Plan began in mid-1947) left him little alternative but to yield to American pressure over Palestine policy. At the reconvened London Conference in January 1947, the Jewish negotiators were prepared to accept only partition and the Arab negotiators only a unitary state, which would automatically have had an Arab majority. Neither would accept limited autonomy under British rule. When no agreement could be reached, Bevin threatened to hand the problem over to the United Nations. The threat failed to move either side, the Jewish representatives because they believed that Bevin was bluffing and the Arab representatives because they believed that their cause would prevail before the UN General Assembly. Bevin accordingly announced that he would &quot;ask the UN to take the Palestine question into consideration.&quot;

A week later, the strategic logic of Britain retaining a presence in Palestine was removed when the intention to withdraw from India in August that year was announced. The decision to allow the United Nations to dictate the future of Palestine was formalised by the Attlee government&#x27;s public declaration in February 1947 that Britain&#x27;s Mandate in Palestine had become &quot;unworkable&quot;. Of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine which resulted, Bevin commented: &quot;The majority proposal is so manifestly unjust to the Arabs that it is difficult to see how, in Sir Alexander Cadogan&#x27;s words, &#x27;we could reconcile it with our conscience.&#x27;&quot;

The fighting between the Jewish and Arab communities continued to escalate until the end of the Mandate. Britain&#x27;s final withdrawal from Palestine was marked by the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the start of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when five Arab states intervened in the intercommunal fighting. The Arab armies were led by Jordan, the most effective state, whose military forces were trained and led by British officers. The war ended with Israel, in addition to the territory assigned by the UN for the creation of a Jewish state, also in control of much of the Mandate territory that had been assigned by the UN for the creation of an Arab state. The remainder was divided between Jordan and Egypt. Hundreds of thousands of overwhelmingly Arab civilians had been displaced.

Bevin was infuriated by attacks on British troops carried out by the more extreme of the Jewish militant groups, the Irgun and Lehi, commonly known as the Stern Gang. The Haganah carried out less direct attacks until the King David Hotel bombing, when it restricted itself to illegal immigration activities. According to declassified MI6 files, the Irgun and the Lehi attempted to assassinate Bevin himself in 1946.

Bevin negotiated the Portsmouth Treaty with Iraq (signed on 15 January 1948), which, according to Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Fadhel al-Jamali, was accompanied by a British undertaking to withdraw from Palestine in such a fashion as to provide for swift Arab occupation of all its territory.

==Later life==

Owing to failing health, Bevin reluctantly allowed himself to be appointed Lord Privy Seal in March 1951. &quot;I am neither a Lord, nor a Privy, nor a Seal&quot;, he is said to have commented. He died from a heart attack in the following month, still holding the key to his red box. His ashes are buried in Westminster Abbey.

Upon Stafford Cripps&#x27;s death in 1952, Clement Attlee (by this time Leader of the Opposition) was invited to broadcast a tribute by the BBC. He was looked after by announcer Frank Phillips. After the broadcast, Phillips took Attlee to the hospitality room for a drink and in order to make conversation said:&quot;I suppose you will miss Sir Stafford, sir.&quot;Attlee fixed him with his eye: &quot;Did you know Ernie Bevin?&quot;&quot;I have met him, sir,&quot; Phillips replied.&quot;There&#x27;s the man I miss.&quot;

James Chuter Ede, Home Secretary throughout the time that Bevin was at the Foreign Office (and for a few months after his death), had worked with Churchill, Attlee, Keynes and many other significant figures. When Bevin&#x27;s biographer, Alan Bullock, asked Chuter Ede for his view of Bevin, he replied:&quot;Was he the biggest man I met in the Labour movement? He was the biggest man I met in any movement.&quot;

A bust of Bevin has been placed opposite Devon Mansions and the former St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School in Tooley Street, South London. Bevin was offered many honours as his reputation grew, but declined all of them.

==Assessments==
Martin Folly argues that assessments on Bevin as foreign secretary divide into two schools. After the opening of the British archives, historians, led by the biographer Alan Bullock celebrated Bevin as one of the great men in British diplomatic history. They argued that he dominated foreign policy; led the Foreign Office by strength of character and clarity of vision; and carried through on his grand design for Britain&#x27;s revised role in world affairs, especially in close alliance with the United States, his support for NATO, and his rejection of an alternative of Britain as a neutral third force, as advocated by the left wing of his party. He succeeded in convincing the United States to take over some of Britain&#x27;s burdens, especially Greece. He thereby became a major influence in pushing the United States into a leadership role through the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO and the Cold War.

However, a revisionist approach appeared in the late 1980s. It portrays Bevin as a narrow-minded anti-Communist and gives more credit to the Foreign Office for the new foreign-policy. In that interpretation, Bevin lost the opportunity to make Britain a leader in European affairs, and it instead became more of a tail on the American kite.

==In popular culture==
Bevin was featured prominently in Jack Thorne&#x27;s 2023 play &quot;When Winston Went to War with the Wireless&quot;, played by Kevin McMonagle.

<text>Étienne de Silhouette (5 July 1709 – 20 January 1767) was a French Ancien Régime Controller-General of Finances under Louis XV.

==Life==
Sometimes said to be akin to the next Niccolò Machiavelli, he was born at Limoges where his father Chevalier Arnaud de Silhouette, of Biarritz or de Zulueta (in Basque), had been posted as a Bourbon administrator.
De Silhouette studied finance and economics assiduously and spent a year in London learning about the economy of Britain.

He translated into French several works by Alexander Pope, Henry Bolingbroke, William Warburton&#x27;s &quot;The Alliance between Church and State&quot;, (1736) as &quot;Dissertations sur l&#x27;Union de la Religion, de la Morale, et de la Politique&quot; (1742) and Baltasar Gracián&#x27;s &quot;El político&quot;. The Prince of Condé&#x27;s party later used his translations from English to criticize him, but Madame de Pompadour&#x27;s support and vision saw him awarded with the position of Controller-General on 4 March 1759; this was one of the most extensive administrative positions in the Ancien Régime, albeit a very unstable one. His task was to curb France&#x27;s spiralling deficit and strengthen the finances for the Seven Years&#x27; War against Britain (1754–1763). Public opinion preferred his 72-million-livres public loan to the &quot;ferme générale&quot;, an outsourced tax collection system. He managed to curtail Royal household expenditure, revised state pensions and to encourage free trade he reduced some ancient taxes whilst establishing new ones in accordance with the vision of a unified French market.

De Silhouette forecast a bleak budget for 1760: income of 286 million livres compared to expenses of 503 million livres, including at least 94 million in debt service. In an attempt to restore the kingdom&#x27;s finances by the English method of taxing the rich and privileged (nobility and church were exempt from taxes in the Ancien Régime), de Silhouette devised the &quot;general subvention,&quot; i.e., taxes on external signs of wealth (doors and windows, farms, luxury goods, servants, profits). On 26 October, he took the war measure of ordering the melting down of goldware and silverware. He was criticized by the nobility including Voltaire, who thought his measures, though theoretically beneficial, were not suitable for wartime and the French political situation.

On 20 November 1759, after eight months in the position, he left the court and retired to Bry-sur-Marne, where he set about improving the budget. After his death in 1767, his nephew and heir Clément de Laage completed his work.

==The Silhouette legacy==
Despite Étienne de Silhouette&#x27;s short tenure as Treasury Chief, it caused him to become the subject of hostility. His penny-pinching manner led the term &quot;à la Silhouette&quot; to be applied to things perceived as cheap or austere.

During this period an art form of growing popularity was a shadow profile cut from black paper. It provided a simple and inexpensive alternative for those who could not afford more decorative and expensive forms of portraiture, such as painting or sculpture. Those who considered it cheap attached the word &quot;silhouette&quot; to it. This art-form is still practiced and named silhouette cutting, or art, to this day.

Despite his name being applied to the silhouette art form, Étienne de Silhouette ironically has no portraits in existence, not even a silhouette. Although several portraits were created depicting Silhouette, all were oil paintings destroyed during the French Revolution.

<doc id="402770" wikidata="Q317235" url="?curid=402770" title="Bapaume">
<text>Bapaume (original Dutch name Batpalmen) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of northern France.

==Geography==
Bapaume is a farming and light industrial town located some 23 km south by south-east of Arras and 50 km north-east of Amiens. Access to the commune is by the D 917 road from Ervillers in the north which passes through the commune in a zig-zag then continues south-east to Beaulencourt. The D 930 goes east by north-east to Frémicourt. The D 929 branches off the D 917 at the edge of the commune and goes south-west to Warlencourt-Eaucourt. The A1 autoroute passes south down the eastern edge of the commune and serves the city by the exit 14.

===The Bapaume threshold===

Bapaume has been called the &quot;Seuil de Bapaume&quot; (Bapaume threshold) due to its position as a crossing point between Artois and the Flanders plain on one side, and the Somme valley and the Paris Basin on the other. From the mid-11th century there was a Bapaume toll which was revised in 1202 and again in 1442.

Many roads pass through Bapaume, both old roads between the two regions then the autoroute (1965) and the TGV (1993). In the 19th century, however, the city council opposed the passage through its territory of the Paris–Lille railway.

This position was regretted by 1859 when the municipality called for the construction of a railway linking Achiet-le-Grand (on the Paris-Lille route) to Bapaume with animal traction (possibly they were afraid of steam). The first section of the Achiet–Marcoing railway linked the two communes and was commissioned in 1871, with steam traction. The line was later extended to Marcoing. The TGV came to the town in 1993.

==Toponymy==
Bapaume (&quot;Batpalmen&quot; or &quot;Bapalmen&quot; in Flemish) means &quot;beat your palms&quot; in the sense of &quot;suffering&quot; because of the poverty of the land or some past devastation.

==History==
===Early Bapaume===
The current city is not in its original location. During the Gallic period the town was located some 1500 m to the west near an abundant source: the source of the Sensée river. During the Roman Empire the town prospered as it was next to the road linking Bavay to Amiens. This period lasted about three centuries.

The barbarian invasions of 255–280 totally destroyed this first Bapaume.

Under the Late Roman Empire the city was rebuilt in the same place by Batavi settlers who were enlisted as soldier-farmers. Defensive mounds were built around the site of the current Bapaume and the road from Arras to Saint-Quentin and Péronne was diverted to pass near the defences.

This town was called &quot;Helena&quot; and was the place where Aetius repulsed the Frankish invasion attempt in 448. This invasion was successful in 454 and ended the Roman presence. During the following centuries the city was devastated several times. The Franks built a castle on the Roman mound as the area was inhabited by bandits who hid in the Arrouaise forest. A bandit called &quot;Bérenger&quot; seized the castle by a ruse and made his mark on it. After his death the people of &quot;Helluin&quot; (Helena) came to shelter near the fort and thus Bapaume was born. Helluin disappeared gradually. It is through several excavations at this place that traces of this city were found and its history.

===The Counts of Flanders===
The city gradually grew in importance, the main traffic was not east–west but north–south. To ensure the passage against the bandits a toll was established by the counts of Flanders with soldiers escorting the merchants on the part crossing the Arrouaise Forest and north of the city. Churches were built with this toll. The Lords of Bapaume were subject to the Counts of Flanders.
On 28 April 1180 the marriage of Philip Augustus and Isabelle of Hainaut, daughter of Baldwin V was celebrated at Bapaume. Due to this union, in 1191 Bapaume was placed under the control of the King of France.
===The Kingdom of France and the County of Artois===
Philip Augustus returned several times to Bapaume to grant communal charters. The city became independent with the construction of a town hall with a belfry, the creation of a coat of arms and a seal, and a citizens&#x27; militia. In 1202 the toll was first revised then a second time in 1291. It was Louis IX of France, in 1237, who attached Bapaume to the County of Artois from under the thumb of Robert d&#x27;Artois, his brother, provided it paid homage to the kings of France. The city enjoyed a period of prosperity from the toll and its fine linen weaving (Batiste) by &quot;mulquiniers&quot; in the countryside. Robert I, Count of Artois was succeeded by Robert II, Count of Artois then Mahaut, Countess of Artois as head of the County of Artois. The nephew of Mahaut called himself Robert III of Artois and claimed the throne for a long time and, in revenge, helped the English. There followed a long period of war and disasters.

Countess Mahaut often resided at the castle as she traveled frequently. She had her own room there and undertook numerous fortification works. On her death Bapaume passed to the Count of Flanders in 1330. He undertook major works including a surrounding wall and large ditches around the city in 1335. The entire castle and city was one of the most beautiful fortresses and was called the &quot;Key of Artois&quot;.

===The Hundred Years&#x27; War===
The fortifications protected the inhabitants of Bapaume repeatedly from frightful depredations by the English in that war. The Bailiwick of Bapaume suffered terribly during this period: it is during this time that villagers hid in their &quot;muches&quot; (underground hiding places) dug in the chalky soil.

===The Dukes of Burgundy===
Bapaume was under the control of the Dukes of Burgundy from 1383 to 1494 and it was in this city that John the Fearless took refuge after the assassination of the Duke of Orléans in 1407. It was also at Bapaume that he reunited his army to reenter the campaign on 30 January 1414. In July 1414 the King of France laid siege to Bapaume: John&#x27;s garrison surrendered without fear and Charles VI then went to besiege Arras. A peace treaty was signed on 30 August and Bapaume was given to John the Fearless, but it was in such a state that on 3 September there were insufficient voters to elect aldermen. After the death of John, his son Philip the Good spent several days at the castle in 1420 and it was he who in 1437 granted the town of Bapaume two free fairs per year. A period of prosperity followed but on 4 April 1472 a terrible fire destroyed the city. It was then looted and burned by the troops of Louis XI on 7 May 1475 and again in 1477. In 1486 Charles VIII attacked Artois again and thus Bapaume. The area suffered much from the fighting between the Burgundians and the French. On 4 June 1488 fire caused further damage to the city.
===Administration by the Netherlands===
As a result of the Treaty of Senlis of 13 May 1493 concluded between the King of France and Maximilian of Austria, Bapaume came under the rule of the House of Austria and was administered by the governors of the Netherlands and Governors appointed by the kings of Spain until 1641. A new era of prosperity began, troubled by the attempts of Governors to restrict the privileges of the city. On 23 July 1509 Mayor Philippe Leclercq obtained a written statement of the powers of Mayors and Aldermen of Bapaume.

Bapaume suffered much from the rivalry between François I and Charles V. The city was devastated by the French on 15 October 1521 and went to Charles V in the Treaty of Madrid. It was again destroyed by fire in 1543 although in the meantime the Emperor had given the order to rebuild the castle and fortifications. The region was again ravaged by the French armies in 1554.

After an attempt to take the castle by a person called Lelievre, the residents of Bapaume ensured that the fortifications of the castle and the city were rebuilt in 1578. The period troubled by incursions and devastation lasted until 1598 when the Treaty of Vervins was signed on 2 May. An era of peace and prosperity followed, despite a plague epidemic in 1626, which ended in March 1635 when Louis XIII declared war on Philip IV of Spain. On 18 September 1641 Bapaume surrendered after a siege by the French army. This capitulation was highly celebrated in Paris since Bapaume was considered one of the main strongholds of Artois and Flanders.

===Bapaume and the Kingdom of France===
Louis XIII confirmed the powers of the city in 1642. He reinforced the fortifications that had suffered during the siege. The city and the surrounding countryside still had to suffer the presence of Spanish and French armies until 1654 (Arras was taken by Louis XIV who passed through Bapaume twice in August).

The sun king passed through Bapaume several times in 1667 while returning from Flanders. On 11 May 1670 he came to review the troops stationed near the city. On 7 May 1673 he passed the night at the castle after inspecting the fortifications.

In 1681 Bapaume was destroyed by fire after which it was forbidden to rebuild with thatched roofs. In 1723 a statue of Louis XV on a horse was erected in the square. This was the first statue of the young monarch in France. On 24 July 1744 the king passed through Bapaume and was highly acclaimed by the people. He again passed through the city on 6 September 1745, 2 May and 11 June 1746, and 25 September 1747.

===The Fortifications===
Its position subjected Bapaume to multiple wars. Defensive structures were built: first a Roman camp, then a Motte-and-bailey castle, and finally and a castle in the location of the motte. Queen Mahaut of Artois had her chamber in this castle and it seems that Joan of Arc spent one night there.

In 1335 the city itself was fortified away from the castle. These fortifications were not, however, very effective and the city was taken repeatedly. In 1540 Charles V ordered a fortified place to be built. Thick walls with bastions surrounding the city and the castle were included. In 1578 the castle and the city were united into one whole. These fortifications by Charles V were later reinforced by Vauban. Elaborate defensive systems such as mines and tunnels were built.

In 1550 &quot;Wallerand de Hauteclocque&quot;, Squire and Lord of Wail, Havernas, and Hauteclocque, was appointed by the king as lieutenant and captain of the town and castle of Bapaume.

Later Dominique de Grossolles, knight and Lord of Saint-Martin, became &quot;Major of the town and castle of Bapaume&quot;.

In the 19th century Bapaume was not considered a walled city. The dismantling of fortifications was therefore undertaken in 1847. This was done by the Army as part of maneuvers and experiments with explosives. The walls and bastions were leveled and the ditches were filled. Only the tower and part of the Dauphin bastion are still visible.

Work has been done recently to restore the underground galleries and make them available to visit: firstly, the &quot;Bastion of Reyne&quot; south-east of the city and then, on the other side, the Dauphin Bastion. These tunnels served as shelter during the two world wars.

===The French Revolution===
Bapaume society was transformed during the French Revolution. During the Terror, the Castle was not sufficient to imprison citizens suspected of not being favourable to the Revolution. Homes vacated by residents who had fled were requisitioned to serve as prisons.

Joseph Le Bon came to the commune revive the actions of the revolutionary committee.

The city was the capital of the district from 1790 to 1795.

===The Battle of Bapaume on 2 and 3 January 1871===

The Battle of Bapaume was fought on 2 and 3 January 1871 during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 on the territories of Biefvillers-lès-Bapaume and Bapaume.

General Louis Léon César Faidherbe at the head of the Northern Army stopped the Prussians.
===World War I===

In 1916 Bapaume was one of the cities considered to be strategic objectives by the allies in the framework of the Battle of the Somme.
Bapaume was occupied by the Germans on 26 September 1914 then by the British on 17 March 1917. The town hall was destroyed on 25 March by a delayed action mine left by the Germans, killing 24 people including Australian soldiers and two French members of parliament.

On 24 March 1918, the Germans took over the city again.

In 1918 the Second Battle of Bapaume, 21 August–3 September, was part of the second phase of the Battle of Amiens, the British and Commonwealth attack that was the turning point of the First World War on the Western Front and the beginning of the Allies&#x27; Hundred Days Offensive. Improved armoured support and artillery bombardment weakened once impregnable positions and helped the Allied forces tear holes through trench lines. On 29 August the New Zealand Division, after heavy fighting, occupied Bapaume, having broken through, with the British 5th Infantry Division, the very strong Le Transloy-Loupart trench system and having overcome many other strong points around the town.

The Germans set up a trap in the town hall with a mine and a timer which exploded just before the arrival of the Australians. The First Battle of Bapaume ran from 24 to 25 March 1918 and the Second Battle of Bapaume from 21 August to 3 September 1918.

After the armistice the slow and dangerous work of demining began. The city was classified as a red zone and major work was done for reconstruction. The English city of Sheffield provided assistance for reconstruction.

There remains from this time a war memorial and two military cemeteries that also have graves from the Second World War:

*The &quot;Bapaume Communal Cemetery&quot;
*The &quot;Bapaume Australian Cemetery&quot; houses the remains of 88 soldiers from 1914 to 1918 at a place called the &quot;Pré Pot de Chart&quot;. This is a cemetery which was created in March 1917 by the 3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station. It was closed in June 1917 then after that 23 German bodies were added in April and May 1918.

Bapaume church was demolished by shelling in 1916
===World War II===
During World War II Bapaume was again an area of intense fighting. The mayor, Abel Guidet, was a member of the Resistance and was arrested and deported to the camp of Gross-Rosen where he died on 27 November 1944.

Since 1948 there has been a monument showing the moment of his arrest to honour his memory. At the Town Hall are an urn with soil from Groß-Rosen and a painting featuring the mayor.

===Twinning===

Bapaume has twinning associations with:
* Moers-Kapellen, Germany since 1974.

The pairing with Moers is the work of Henri Guidet, the son of Abel Guidet, who is involved in Franco-German reconciliation.

* Anstruther, Fife, Scotland (since October 1991)

==Economy==
There is a &quot;Centre of Detention&quot; which is particularly known for being the last detention centre that hosted Lucien Léger (1937–2008) who was the oldest prisoner in France (and Europe) and stayed there for several years until his release in 2005.

==Sites and monuments==

===The Town Hall and belfry===
The town hall with its current belfry was built in 1931 and 1932 with architecture similar to the previous building built in 1610 and destroyed in 1917. The first belfry was built in the 12th century according to charters that had been issued to the city of Bapaume. Subsequently, the building became too small and aldermen obtained permission to extend it in 1374. Because of the wars that followed the belfry became dangerous and was demolished in 1537. A new belfry was started in 1583 but after many vicissitudes the building was built then destroyed and it was Philip II of Spain in 1590 who authorized the construction of a new building which was completed in 1610. It had columns and arches on the façade similar to the Arras Town Hall. For its construction the Bapaume aldermen had authorisation to establish a right of passage.
===The statue of General Faidherbe===

A statue of Louis Faidherbe was dedicated on 27 September 1891 and originally sculpted by Louis Noël. On 29 September 1916 the statue was requisitioned by the Germans who believed it was bronze and the statue disappeared. The pedestal, pitted by shrapnel, remained empty for 13 years. It was not until 1926 that the town decided to ask the sculptor Déchin, stepson of Louis Noël, from Paris to recreate the statue from the original plans. The new monument was inaugurated on 18 August 1929 by Paul Painlevé, Minister of War. During the redevelopment of the square in 1997 the statue was moved a few metres lower on 26 September.
===Monument to Briquet and Taillandier===

A monument was erected in front of the town hall in memory of Albert Taillandier and Raoul Briquet who were killed in the explosion of the Town Hall on 25 March 1917. They were both elected representatives of Pas-de-Calais but of different parties: Taillandier was a Conservative while Briquet was a Socialist. They were on an inspection mission to the front on behalf of the National Assembly of France and wished to spend the night in the building but they were trapped and killed by the explosion. Ernst Jünger wrote in his &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; that the explosion was caused by an Improvised explosive device (IED) that had been left by retreating German troops.


===The Church of Saint Nicolas===
The origin of the parish of Saint-Nicolas coincides with the origin of the town. The first church was built in 1085 when the town first became important but had disappeared by the end of the 14th century. The second church was built around the year 1600 but destroyed during the First World War. It was rebuilt on the same foundations between 1924 and 1929. The Church contains three items that are registered as historical objects:
*A Bas-relief: the Resurrection (16th century) (disappeared in 1916)
*A Statue: Virgin of Pity (16th century). This statue was the only object from the Church to survive the First World War.
*The Organ (1934) 
===The War memorial===
This structure consists of a stone wall, topped by a pediment decorated with the coat of arms of the city, bordered on either side of a balustrade. Under the pediment above the three column list of soldiers killed in 1914–1918 are the words &quot;Pro Patria&quot; in large size followed by the text &quot;La ville de Bapaume à ses enfants&quot; (The city of Bapaume to its children). Further down on the side there is a standing woman with a child clearly symbolizing a widow and an orphan. The woman, hair partially covered with a veil which descends down her back until mid-legs, has her right arm raised to designate a name using a palm held in her hand. She has, in a sign of protection, her left hand placed on the left shoulder of the child who, in short pants, head high, and confident, holds a beret in his right hand and holding a wreath around the left forearm. The bottom section of the monument contains a list in four columns of the missing from the 1939–1945 war.

===Other sites of interest===
*A Motte-and-bailey castle. Nothing is left of the old castle other than sections of wall from the fortifications of the city. The site itself has retained its crater shape and was converted into a green park and place for walking. This site is nicknamed &quot;Le Donjon&quot; (The Dungeon) by the people of Bapaume.
*The Australian War Cemetery has an area of 459 m2 with 88 graves from the First World War. This cemetery was opened in March 1917 by the 3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station and used until June 1917. In April and May 1918 23 German graves were added.

<text>Little Solsbury Hill (or simply Solsbury Hill) is a small flat-topped hill and the site of an Iron Age hill fort, above the village of Batheaston in Somerset, England. The hill rises to above the River Avon, which is just over to the south, and gives views of the city of Bath and the surrounding area. It is within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The hill is one of several possible locations of the Battle of Badon and shows the remains of a medieval field system. Part of the hill was quarried in the 19th century. In 1930, it was acquired by the National Trust. The hill was the inspiration of the Peter Gabriel song &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;, recorded in 1977. A small turf labyrinth was cut into the turf by protesters during the widening of the A46 in 1994.

==Etymology==
It is sometimes misspelled as &quot;Salisbury&quot;, or &quot;Solisbury&quot;, perhaps because of confusion with Salisbury Plain (a plateau in southern England), or the city of Salisbury. Salisbury and Solsbury can be difficult to distinguish in speech; Salisbury is often pronounced &quot;Saulsbury&quot;, and sometimes the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Salisbury&quot; is pronounced as an &quot;o&quot;, and the &quot;i&quot; is elided, making the pronunciations of the two words practically identical. The name &#x27;Solsbury&#x27; may be derived from the Celtic god Sulis, a deity worshipped at the thermal spring in nearby Bath. A geological map by Horace B Woodward in the back of the 1888 &quot;Handbook of Bath&quot; labels the hill as &#x27;Stilisbury Hill&#x27;.

==Geology==
The hill is formed in layers from a variety of sedimentary rocks of Jurassic age. In common with the Cotswold plateau to the north, the summit is formed from rocks ascribed to the Chalfield Oolite Formation. The oolite, together with the Fuller&#x27;s Earth Formation which underlies it, forms a part of the Great Oolite Group of rocks of Bathonian age. Beneath these are, successively, Bajocian age limestones of the Inferior Oolite Group and sandstones of the Bridport Sand Formation. The last-named unit forms a part of the Lias Group of rocks of Toarcian age. Beneath all of these is the relatively thick Charmouth Mudstone Formation sequence rising from the edge of the valley floor alluvium. All faces of the hill are subject to large areas of landslip.

The high hill is just over north of the River Avon.

==Hill fort==
Solsbury Hill was an Iron Age hill fort occupied between 300 BC and 100 BC, comprising a triangular area enclosed by a single &quot;univallate&quot; rampart, faced inside and out with well-built dry stone walls and infilled with rubble. The rampart was wide and the outer face was at least high. The top of the hill was cleared down to the bedrock, then substantial huts were built with wattle and daub on a timber frame. After a period of occupation, some of the huts were burnt down, the rampart was overthrown, and the site was abandoned, never to be reoccupied. This event is probably part of the Belgic invasion of Britain in the early part of the 1st century BC.

The hillfort is protected as a scheduled monument.

==Later history==
The hill is near the Fosse Way Roman Road as it descends Bannerdown hill into Batheaston on its way to Bath. Solsbury Hill is a possible location of the Battle of Badon, fought between the Britons (under the legendary King Arthur) and the Saxons c. 496, mentioned by the chroniclers Gildas and Nennius. The hilltop also shows the remains of a medieval or post medieval field system.

The hill also has two disused quarries, one listed on the northwest side on a 1911 map, and another one listed between 1885 and 1900 as an old quarry on the west side. It was acquired by the National Trust in 1930. People protesting against the building of an A46 bypass road cut a small turf maze into the hill, during the construction of the bypass in the mid-1990s. In one day of protests, 11 people, including George Monbiot, were hospitalised as a result of beatings by the security guards.

==Wildlife==

The plants and animals that live on Little Solsbury reflect the habitat provided by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist plants and animals, some of which are rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant.

Examples of plant species found include bird&#x27;s foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot;), and scabious. It is one of a series of flower-rich habitats that Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;) nest in the area. Roe deer (&quot;Capreolus capreolus&quot;), badger and red fox are seen. Skylarks also nest on the hill.

==In popular culture==
Solsbury Hill (more accurately &#x27;Little Solsbury&#x27;) is the inspiration for an eponymous song, released in 1977 by rock musician Peter Gabriel as his first solo single. A recording of the natural sounds on the hill forms the track &quot;A Quiet Moment&quot; on Gabriel&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;New Blood&quot;, which precedes the orchestral version of his song.

&quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot;, a historical fiction trilogy of books, places the site of Mount Badon at Solsbury Hill.

<text>Barlin () is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region in northern France.

==Geography==
A small ex-coal mining town, now a light engineering and farming commune, Barlin is situated south of Béthune and southwest of Lille, at the junction of the D57, D179 and the D188 roads.

==History==
Barlin dates to at least 1141, the year of the first mention of the parish of Barlin in a manuscript now kept in the National Archives. It was then spelt &quot;Ballin&quot; or &quot;Bellin&quot;. The name changed several times over the centuries, being recorded as &quot;Ballin&quot; in 1141, &quot;Bellin&quot; in 1438 and &quot;Barlaing&quot; in 1556; it was not until the next century that it became &quot;Barlin&quot;.

In the 12th century, the territory of Barlin was divided into several lordships that depended on Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, Arras or Béthune. In 1207, Thomas Hasbare was seigneur of Barlin. The Melun family succeeded him and one of their lords, nicknamed Le Brun, the king&#x27;s chamberlain, saw his property confiscated by Duke John the Fearless, who had accused him of allegiance with his enemies. The Duke of Burgundy then donated the land and income of Barlin to Walleran de Juhaucourt.

In the mid-nineteenth century, coalmining began at Barlin, and the town flourished. Its mines closed in the 1960s.

Today, Barlin is a modern and dynamic place that offers its residents numerous amenities: schools, colleges, a swimming pool, a library and sports halls.

<doc id="402779" wikidata="Q5477178" url="?curid=402779" title="Foxhole (band)">
<text>Foxhole is a post-rock band from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Founded in November 2000 on the campus of Western Kentucky University, the group was heavily influenced by other Kentucky-linked bands such as Slint and June of 44. Foxhole has released three albums on Philadelphia&#x27;s Burnt Toast Vinyl label and in December 2018 their latest LP, &quot;Well Kept Thing&quot;, was Grammy-nominated for &quot;Best Recording Package.&quot;

==About==

The band initially focused on melding experimental sounds with melody. A staple of early performances was a fully improvised song (designated &quot;X&quot;) randomly inserted into the set list, and which often featured several homemade instruments, including the &quot;juggophone&quot;, &quot;shatterophone&quot;, &quot;topophone&quot;, and &quot;pyrophone&quot;, which utilized the sounds of beating water jugs, breaking bottles, clinking pot tops, and micing fireworks, respectively. They also made frequent use of the sounds of a signal generator. Gradually, Foxhole integrated slightly more traditional song structures and held to typical instruments, dispensing mostly with the use of gimmick instrumentation. Songs typically featured a gradual build in intensity, and featured rare and unaugmented vocals.

2002 brought &quot;EP1&quot;, the debut Foxhole release. 500 CDs were pressed and packaged in hand-stitched canvas and embossed cardstock. That summer, the band embarked on a two-week tour across the Eastern half of the United States. In spring 2003 Foxhole released a second EP, &quot;EP2:X&quot;, a compilation of &quot;X&quot; improvisations recorded mostly during the previous summer&#x27;s tour. It too was hand packaged and screenprinted.

As Foxhole continued to change musically, the lineup also changed. Founding member Nathan McBroom left the band in December 2003; 2004 brought on a partnership with Selah Records, from Lansing, MI. Selah funded the release of the Foxhole&#x27;s first full-length. Recorded by Greg at the church which doubled as the band&#x27;s rehearsal space, We The Wintering Tree was a monumental undertaking for the band. Tim Bushong of T-Bush Record Plant mixed the album, and it was mastered at John Golden Mastering. 1000 copies of &quot;We the Wintering Tree&quot; were released in late 2004 and packaged in letterpress-printed white cardstock. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Matt Wilson left the band, also on good terms. Alex O&#x27;Nan, drummer for Louisville &quot;math-rock&quot; band, Of Asaph, filled in for several shows, as did Adam Tanaka, formerly of the hardcore band With Blood Comes Beauty. In January 2005 the band found a permanent replacement in Jason Torrence, drummer for Nashville Americana act God&#x27;s Lonely Man.

As writing for another EP began, Foxhole also increased the frequency of its live performances. In May 2006 they released &quot;Push/Pull&quot; on Philadelphia&#x27;s Burnt Toast Vinyl, after roughly 18 months of recording and pre-production. Recorded by Torrence and Leppert and mixed and mastered by Torrence, the album was thematically inspired by videographer and band friend Aaron Marrs&#x27; death at sea. The complexity and additional production on &quot;Push/Pull&quot; prompted the band to add a sixth member, Brian Toppenberg, to augment live shows.

In early 2010, Foxhole announced plans to return from their 4-year long hiatus and record a new album; drummer Chris Vicari (formerly of Nashville post-rock group Maps) replaced Torrence around this time. The band set to work recording at Nashville&#x27;s Brown Owl Studio in October 2010, with former drummer Torrence serving as lead engineer; however, due to a variety of life events that saw the members disperse to locales including Austin, TX, Louisville, KY and New York City, the sessions were left to simmer for the next few years.

In December 2016, Foxhole gathered back in Bowling Green to revisit the recordings, undertaking rearranging and additional recording at Tyler Cook&#x27;s The Refinery recording studio just blocks away from Shepherd&#x27;s home; Leppert recorded the final portions in a cabin in Cambridge, Mass., in April 2017. The finished album, &quot;Well Kept Thing&quot;, was released on Sept. 22, 2018 on Burnt Toast Vinyl. It was mixed by Grammy-winning engineer Stephen Roessner, and mastered by Shellac&#x27;s Bob Weston at Chicago Mastering Service. In December 2018, &quot;Well Kept Thing&quot; was nominated for a Grammy for &quot;Best Recording Package.&quot;

<text>Andrew Clement Serkis (born 20 April 1964) is an English actor and filmmaker. He is best known for his motion capture roles comprising motion capture acting, animation and voice work for computer-generated characters such as Gollum in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy (2001–2003) and &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; (2012), King Kong in the eponymous 2005 film, Caesar in the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; reboot series (2011–2017), Captain Haddock / Sir Francis Haddock in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011), Baloo in his self-directed film &quot;&quot; (2018) and Supreme Leader Snoke in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy films &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), also portraying Kino Loy in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Disney+ series &quot;Andor&quot; (2022).

Serkis&#x27;s film work in motion capture has been critically acclaimed. He has received an Empire Award and two Saturn Awards for his motion-capture acting. He earned a BAFTA and a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of serial killer Ian Brady in the British television film &quot;Longford&quot; (2006) and was nominated for a BAFTA for his portrayal of new wave and punk rock musician Ian Dury in the biopic &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (2010). In 2020, Serkis received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema. In 2021, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for the series &quot;The Letter for the King&quot; (2020).

Serkis portrayed Ulysses Klaue in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films &quot;&quot; (2015) and &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), as well as the Disney+ series &quot;What If…?&quot; (2021). He also played Alfred Pennyworth in &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022). Serkis has his own production company and motion capture workshop, The Imaginarium in London, which he used for &quot;&quot;. He made his directorial debut with Imaginarium&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;Breathe&quot; and also directed &quot;&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Serkis was born on 20 April 1964 in Ruislip Manor in Middlesex (now Greater London). He grew up in both Ruislip and Baghdad, Iraq. His mother, Lylie Weech, was half Iraqi and half English, and taught disabled children; his father, Clement Serkis, was an Iraqi-Armenian gynaecologist. His ancestors&#x27; original Armenian surname was &quot;Sarkisian&quot;. His father often worked abroad in the Middle East, while Serkis and his siblings were raised in Britain, with regular holidays in the Middle Eastern cities of Tyre, Sidon, Damascus and Baghdad. Both of his parents were devoutly Catholic.

Serkis was educated at St Benedict&#x27;s School, Ealing. He studied visual arts and theatre as part of his degree at Lancaster University and graduated in 1985. Serkis was a member of The County College and part of the student radio station Bailrigg FM. He joined the Nuffield Studio, getting involved in designing and producing plays.

Having agreed to act in a couple of productions towards the end of his first year, Serkis played the lead role in Barrie Keeffe&#x27;s play &quot;Gotcha&quot; as a rebellious teenager holding a teacher hostage. As a result, he changed his major subject to acting, constructing his Independent Studies Degree around acting and set design, studying Konstantin Stanislavski and Bertolt Brecht, and including minor modules in art and visual graphics. In his final year at Lancaster he adapted Raymond Briggs&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;The Tin-Pot Foreign General and the Old Iron Woman&quot;, a satire about the Falklands War, as a one-man show, which he performed to acclaim.

==Career==
In his third year at university, Serkis joined the backstage team at the local Duke&#x27;s Playhouse to earn his Equity card. On graduating, although advised to take a one-year post-graduate acting course, he joined Dukes as an actor. Under director Jonathan Petherbridge, who used workshops based on the methods of Augusto Boal, he spent 18 months acting in a broad range of productions from Brecht, Shakespeare and modern British playwrights. 

After 16 months, and having gained his Equity card, Serkis joined a series of touring companies, including productions of: &quot;Bouncers&quot; opposite Hull Truck; Florizel in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;; and the fool in &quot;King Lear&quot; with director Max Stafford-Clark. In the early 1990s he settled in London, and took a role in April De Angelis&#x27;s &quot;Hush&quot; (Royal Court) as Dogboy. Also the Royal Court Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Mojo,&quot; and Wilson Milam&#x27;s production of &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; (1997) at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, with Rupert Graves and David Tennant. Serkis also developed a career in television, appearing in small roles such as Greville in an episode of &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1992) and a criminal called Maxwell in an episode of &quot;Pie in the Sky&quot; (1994). Serkis joined director Mike Leigh&#x27;s ensemble for two film productions, and appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;Loop&quot; (1997) alongside Susannah York. Serkis portrayed Victorian choreographer John D&#x27;Auban in &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot;, a 1999 film about Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s creation of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. In 1999, Serkis played Bill Sikes in ITV&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. He appeared alongside Sacha Baron Cohen in &quot;The Jolly Boys&#x27; Last Stand&quot; in 2000.
Serkis first came to wide public notice for his performance as Sméagol / Gollum, in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy (2001–2003), for which he provided motion-capture movements and voice for the CGI character. His work on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; started a debate on the legitimacy of CGI-assisted acting. Producer Barrie M. Osborne campaigned for Serkis to have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, as his voice, body language and facial expressions were used. The marketing director of New Line Cinema, Russell Schwartz, had likewise compared Serkis&#x27;s motion capture presence to John Hurt winning Best Actor while wearing a latex mask in The Elephant Man.

Serkis has performed motion-capture work in several other films, including the title character in the 2005 version of King Kong (in which he also played the ship&#x27;s cook in live-action) and as Caesar in &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2011), &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2014), and &quot;War for the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2017). He also worked with game developers Ninja Theory on the 2007 release &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot;, providing the motion capture and voice for King Bohan (the game&#x27;s main villain).

In 2006, Serkis starred as serial killer Ian Brady in the BAFTA-nominated &quot;Longford&quot;, co-starring Samantha Morton as Myra Hindley and Jim Broadbent as Lord Longford. That same year, Serkis appeared in the role of Mr. Grin in &quot;Stormbreaker&quot;, the film rendition of Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Alex Rider&quot; novel. He also acted in the film &quot;The Prestige&quot; as Mr. Alley (assistant to Nikola Tesla), as the voice of one of the henchrats in the Aardman Animations film &quot;Flushed Away&quot; named Spike, and appeared in Jim Threapleton&#x27;s improvised feature film &quot;Extraordinary Rendition&quot;, which premiered in 2007. In 2007, he appeared in &quot;Sugarhouse&quot;, a low-budget independently made film, playing local crime lord Hoodwink, who terrorises an east London housing estate. For the role, Serkis shaved his head and had sessions lasting 20 hours each to have temporary tattoos stencilled onto his body. The film premiered at the 2007 Edinburgh Festival and released in the UK on 24 August. Also that year, Serkis provided the voiceover for &quot;Monkey Life&quot;, on Five broadcast for three weeks from 13 to 31 August 2007. This series was about Monkey World, the popular ape and monkey sanctuary and zoo near Wool, Dorset. In the joint BBC/HBO production &quot;Einstein and Eddington&quot;, (2008) Serkis played Albert Einstein, following the development of his theory of relativity, while David Tennant played scientist Sir Arthur Eddington. In 2008, Serkis appeared as Rigaud in the BBC Television adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; and as Capricorn in &quot;Inkheart&quot;, the film adaptation of Cornelia Funke&#x27;s novel. In 2010, Serkis played 1970s new wave singer Ian Dury in &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

Serkis reunited with Peter Jackson, as a cast member in Jackson&#x27;s and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; trilogy, based on &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Serkis supplied the voice and motion capture performance of Captain Haddock as well as his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock. Filming began in January 2009 and the film was released in 2011. Filming was due to begin in September 2008, but was delayed due to Universal pulling out of backing the project.

In 2009, Serkis voiced the role of the demon Screwtape in Focus on the Family&#x27;s Radio Theatre audio adaptation of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;. In 2010, Serkis was cast as William Hare, with Simon Pegg as Burke, in the John Landis black comedy film &quot;Burke and Hare&quot; based on the Burke and Hare murders in Scotland in 1828. He also featured in the TV series &quot;The Accused&quot;, in &quot;Liam&#x27;s Story&quot;, written by Danny Brocklehurst and Jimmy McGovern. He played Caesar in the 20th Century Fox science-fiction film &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot;. Serkis was acclaimed for his performance as Caesar in 2011, and in a high-profile campaign by 20th Century Fox for him to be honoured with a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, his co-star James Franco stated: &quot;Andy Serkis is the undisputed master of the newest kind of acting called &#x27;motion capture,&#x27; and it is time that Serkis gets credit for the innovative artist that he is.&quot; In 2010, Serkis played Monkey, the lead character along with Lindsey Shaw in the videogame &quot;&quot;.

Serkis would reprise the role of Gollum in &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, the first film in the three-part &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films. It was released in 2012, and the follow-ups were released in 2013 and 2014. He was also the trilogy&#x27;s second unit director, which included directing aerial shots and battle scenes. He was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2012. In 2014, Serkis reprised his role as Caesar in &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, and again in 2017 for &quot;War for the Planet of the Apes&quot;, the last of the trilogy.

In Gareth Edwards&#x27; 2014 science-fiction monster film &quot;Godzilla&quot;, Serkis was the consultant on the film&#x27;s motion capture sequences in order to &quot;control the souls&quot; of the creatures. Serkis played Ulysses Klaue in Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;&quot; (2015), and was also a motion capture consultant on the film. He reprised the role in Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), and provided the voice in the sixth episode of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;What If...?&quot;. He played Supreme Leader Snoke in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) and reprised the role in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), and &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). Serkis appeared as the Ghost of Christmas Past in the 2019 BBC/FX three-part miniseries &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. In 2019, it was announced that Serkis would play Alfred Pennyworth in &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022).

In late 2015, it was announced that Serkis was working on a modern film adaptation of Rumpelstiltskin, titled &quot;Steelskin&quot;. In addition to starring in the film, Serkis will serve as producer and director.

Serkis received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Performer in a Daytime Fiction Program in 2021 for his role as Mayor of Mistrinaut, the father of his real life daughter Ruby&#x27;s character, in the Netflix fantasy series &quot;The Letter for the King&quot;. Also for Netflix, Serkis is scheduled to star alongside Idris Elba and Cynthia Erivo in &quot;&quot;, a television film continuation of Elba&#x27;s series, &quot;Luther&quot;. In 2022, Serkis returned to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise in a different, non-CGI role in the Disney+ television series &quot;Andor&quot;, as Kino Loy.

In October 2024 it was revealed that Serkis would star as Renoir in the upcoming video game &quot;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&quot;, set to be released on 24 April 2025.

In 2011, Serkis founded The Imaginarium Studios with film producer Jonathan Cavendish. The Imaginarium is a production company and creative digital studio based in Ealing, London and is dedicated to inventing digital characters using performance capture technology, which Serkis has often worked with. On 20 October 2012, the studio acquired rights to &quot;The Bone Season&quot; by Samantha Shannon, and in 2023 was in production with a new motion capture adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s Animal Farm.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, on VE Day, Serkis read the entire book of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to raise money for NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings, a pregnancy charity of which he has been an ambassador. More than 650,000 people tuned in worldwide, and Serkis raised more than £283,000 ($351,000). On 2 July 2020, HarperCollinsUK announced that Serkis would professionally narrate &quot;The Hobbit&quot; again to be published for Audible. The audiobook was released on 3 September 2020 in the UK, published by HarperCollins, and 21 September in the US, published by Recorded Books.

<text>José Miguel Carrera Verdugo (; October 15, 1785 – September 4, 1821) was a Chilean general, formerly Spanish military, member of the prominent Carrera family, and considered one of the founders of independent Chile. Carrera was the most important leader of the Chilean War of Independence during the period of the Patria Vieja (&quot;Old Republic&quot;). After the Spanish &quot;Reconquista de Chile&quot; (&quot;Reconquest&quot;), he continued campaigning from exile after defeat. His opposition to the leaders of independent Argentina and Chile, San Martín and O&#x27;Higgins respectively, made him live in exile in Montevideo. From Montevideo Carrera traveled to Argentina where he joined the struggle against the unitarians. Carreras&#x27; small army was eventually left isolated in the Province of Buenos Aires from the other federalist forces. In this difficult situation Carrera decided to cross to native-controlled lands all the way to Chile to once and for all overthrow Chilean Supreme Director O&#x27;Higgins. His passage to Chile, which was his ultimate goal, was opposed by Argentine politicians and he engaged together with indigenous tribes, among them the Ranquel, in a campaign against the southern provinces of Argentina. After the downfall of Carrera&#x27;s ally, the Republic of Entre Ríos, and several victories against the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Carrera&#x27;s men were finally defeated by numerically superior forces near Mendoza. Carrera was then betrayed by one of his Argentine helpers, leading to his capture and execution in that city.

==Early years==
José Miguel Carrera was of Basque descent. He was born in Santiago, the second son (third child, after his sister Javiera and his brother Juan José) of Ignacio de la Carrera y Cuevas and Francisca de Paula Verdugo Fernández de Valdivieso y Herrera. Carrera carried out his first studies in the &quot;Convictorio Carolino&quot;, the best school in the country at the time. During these years, he became friends with Manuel Rodríguez, a classmate and neighbour, future guerrilla leader of the Chilean independence movement.

After school he was sent to Spain by his parents. There he joined the Spanish Army in 1808. He fought against the Napoleonic forces, obtaining the rank of Sergeant Major and receiving the command of the &quot;Húsares de Galicia&quot; regiment.

In Spain he also made contact with the United States independence movement and joined the Cádiz Order.

==La Patria Vieja (&quot;Old Republic&quot;) (1810–1814)==
When he learned about the &quot;Junta de Gobierno&quot; that had been established in Chile to rule during the absence of the Spanish monarch, he went back to Chile and got involved in politics. As the Carreras were one of the three major political forces, he became part of the government. On 15 November 1811 the Carreras made a coup d&#x27;état and José Miguel became the sole ruler of Chile (his brothers were military commanders). Because of his more personal and Chilean-national point of view about Chilean independence, Carrera came into conflict with the Lautaro Lodge, whose more Latin-Americanist centered objective was to unite all Latin America in the same way as the United States of America.

During his government, he helped create several Chilean national symbols and institutions: Carrera created the first Chilean Constitution, made the first Chilean flag and coat of arms, and promoted the press by bringing the first printing press to Chile, which directly led to the appearance of the first newspaper in Chile: &quot;La Aurora de Chile&quot;. Carrera also established September 18 as the national day of Independence (which is still celebrated in Chile), even though the real independence date is on February 12 of 1818. He also abolished slavery, rescinded the clergy&#x27;s right to legal immunity, and founded the first state-sponsored school in Chile, the Instituto Nacional.

As the Spanish Army and Navy invaded the South of Chile, he became Commander in Chief of the patriotic forces and left the government. He had a successful campaign, expelling the Spaniards from the city of Concepción.

After the Surprise of El Roble, in which Carrera was surrounded and had to jump into a river to save himself (not without first shooting straight at the enemy&#x27;s head of commander), the government relieved him of his duties and appointed Brigadier Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, who had managed to repel the enemy incursion. Carrera was taken prisoner by the Spaniards but managed to escape, he finally exchanged prisoner after the Gainza treaty, and went on to overthrow the government for the third time.

Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins did not acknowledge Carrera and fought against the Carrera&#x27;s army at the Battle of Tres Acequias (Carrera&#x27;s youngest brother, Luis Carrera, defeated O&#x27;Higgins using a cunning defensive strategy). During this chaos, the Spanish army retook Concepción and advanced towards Santiago. Carrera and O&#x27;Higgins decided to re-unite the army; Carrera&#x27;s plan was to draw the Spaniards to the Angostura del Paine, while O&#x27;Higgins wanted to make his stand at the town of Rancagua. It was settled to make it at the Angostura de Paine, a gorge that formed an easily defended bottleneck, which seemed to be the most logical plan considering that the local forces were outnumbered. However, at the last hour and against direct orders, O&#x27;Higgins garrisoned the Chilean forces at the main square of Rancagua. He and his forces were promptly surrounded, and after an entire day of fighting, the Spanish commander Mariano Osorio was victorious in the Disaster of Rancagua, (1–2 October 1814).

==Argentina and the United States==
With the defeat of the Chilean forces, many patriots escaped to Mendoza, which was governed at the time by José de San Martín. As San Martín was a member of the Lautaro Lodge, he welcomed O&#x27;Higgins and his allies. After committing acts of vandalism José Miguel and his brothers were arrested and sent to Buenos Aires, where Carlos María de Alvear, a friend of Carrera since the war against Napoleon in Spain, had just been proclaimed national hero. Alvear would shortly go on to take power in Argentina.

While Alvear was in government, Carrera was in a good position in Buenos Aires. But after Alvear was overthrown, power was taken by members of the Lautaro Lodge, forcing Carrera to leave Buenos Aires for the United States. With the help of Commodore David Porter, and by sheer force of personality, José Miguel Carrera managed to obtain—on credit—four ships with American crews for the Chilean independence enterprise.

However, as he arrived in Buenos Aires with this fleet, the pro-San Martin Argentine government confiscated the ships and put Carrera in prison. During his imprisonment, San Martín organized an army in Mendoza. This group crossed the Andes and defeated the Spaniards in the Battle of Chacabuco, on 12 February 1817.

Carrera received help from the United States&#x27; envoy who came with him, Joel Roberts Poinsett, and was able to escape from San Martin&#x27;s forces, taking refuge in Montevideo under the protection of Brazilian General Carlos Frederico Lecor. While in Montevideo, his brothers Juan José and Luís plotted against O&#x27;Higgins, because of his having betrayed the Carreras to San Martin and the Lautaro Lodge. They were arrested in Mendoza and executed by the command of Bernardo de Monteagudo, after the Royalists defeated San Martin and O&#x27;Higgins at the Second Battle of Cancha Rayada. The Lautaro Lodge had already made plans that, in case of defeat, all political enemies—including the Carrera brothers—would be executed. After José Miguel was informed of this, he openly and vociferously began opposing both San Martin and O&#x27;Higgins.

Subsequently, Jose Miguel Carrera was one of the main promoters of the Argentine federalist war and fought against the Unitarian government. Carrera and the federalist forces defeated the Directorship government and entered Buenos Aires. On 23 February 1820, they signed the Treaty of Pilar, the document that first established the Argentine federal system. However, because of national rivalries, Carrera is not often recognised in Argentine Historiography.

As a result of this treaty, Carrera received money and troops, with which he marched towards Chile. One of Carrera&#x27;s main ally before his death was the Boroanos tribe that had recently migrated from Araucanía to the Pampas. However, he was intercepted in Mendoza and taken prisoner.

==Trial and execution==
After being judged by his enemies on a show trial, Carrera was executed by a firing squad on 4 September 1821.

==Warrior==

Carrera entered the military career, in Chile, as a mere boy at the age of six. At the age of 22 (1808) he entered the Napoleonic Wars participating in the campaigns of 1808, 1809, and 1810. In Europe Carrera became an elite cavalry officer and a captain in the hussar regiment &quot;Húsares de Farnesio&quot;. He also became commander of the &quot;Húsares de Galicia&quot;. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Talavera and was awarded the&quot; Cruz of Talavera&quot;. He was wounded in the Battle of Ocana. In total he participated in some 20 armed engagements and battles on European soil. 
On his return to Chile he led his men in some 10 battles and/or armed engagements against the Spanish Army. Later, following his trip to the US, and in his attempt to return to Chile, from Argentina, he and his men fought the Argentine in a series or armed confrontations and battles some of which were particularly cruel and bloody. Notable in his Argentine campaign was the Battle of Rio Cuarto. In all, Carrera participated in combat in some 40 separate occasions.

==Legacy==
Carrera is today considered one of the Chileans &quot;Padres de la Patria&quot; (Fathers of the Nation). The conflict between followers of O&#x27;Higgins and Carrera continues to some extent to this day, when many declare themselves &quot;Carreristas&quot; or &quot;O&#x27;Higginistas&quot;. &quot;Carreristas&quot; claim that his figure is not given enough recognition, in comparison with O&#x27;Higgins, whom they openly despise.

Apart from ending slavery in Chile, Carrera abolished the titled nobility and ended their legal prerogatives and privileges. He also founded the first free newspaper in the nation, &quot;La Aurora de Chile&quot;; instituted the first national flag and national seal; and founded the first free secular school, which eventually became known as the Instituto Nacional, its full name being &quot;Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera&quot;; several Chilean presidents and dozens of senators and parliamentarians have graduated from its halls.

In the Patagonian region in the south of Chile, there is the General Carrera Lake.

All five of Carrera&#x27;s legitimate offspring married prominently in Chilean society, and their descendants, who number in the few hundred, make up the bulk of the Chilean upper classes .

His prominent descendants include:

* Ignacio Carrera Pinto, his grandson, a hero who died during the Battle of La Concepción, in the War of the Pacific.
* Federico Santa María, industrialist and millionaire, who gave his money to build Federico Santa María Technical University, one of the best technical and engineering schools in Chile.

==In popular culture==
The life of José Miguel Carrera is shown through the television project &quot;Heroes&quot;. The series include 6 related movies about Chilean Founding Fathers and Heroes, and in it, José Miguel Carrera was portrayed by Diego Casanueva.

<text>Dagnall is a village in the parish of Edlesborough, in Buckinghamshire, England.

The place name is derived from the Old English for &quot;Daegga&#x27;s Knoll&quot;. In manorial rolls of 1196 it was listed as &quot;Dagenhale&quot;.
The spelling &quot;Dagenhale&quot; appears in a legal record of 1450. Thomas Bradwater is listed as a husbandman of the place.

Dagnall is in the Chiltern Hills and in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is next to the Ashridge Estate, owned and managed by The National Trust. House prices are significantly higher than average, in common with comparable locations in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

==Location==
Four main roads link Dagnall with the nearby towns of Dunstable, Leighton Buzzard, Tring, Hemel Hempstead and Berkhamsted, and slightly further on to the larger towns of Luton, Aylesbury and Milton Keynes. 
The nearest villages to Dagnall are Ashridge, Studham and Whipsnade. Whipsnade Zoo is on the hill above the village.

The tripoint of Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire is immediately to the south of Dagnall.

==Parish church==
All Saints&#x27; parish church is a Church of England and Methodist local ecumenical partnership and has clergy from both denominations.

==Dagnall C of E School==
Dagnall Church of England School is a mixed, community church primary school, which has capacity for 105 pupils and today educates children from the ages of three to eleven. The school became a voluntary aided church school, under the Diocese of St Albans, in 2016, and changed its name to Dagnall VA C of E School. Dagnall School, as it was then called, opened in 1909. In 1989 the number of registered pupils at Dagnall County First School, as it was then called, had fallen to just 13 and the school was at risk of closure. This risk came partly from the Education Reform Act 1988 which would introduce a National Curriculum that the school might not have been able to meet. A dedicated campaign saved the school by 1990.

==Local amenities==
Amenities include one public house and two local farm shops. A further gastro pub is located just north of the village boundary. School buses are provided for children that go to Edlesborough School and Secondary Schools such as The Cottesloe School in Wing. The village falls within the catchment area of the prestigious and renowned Aylesbury Grammar School. There are also private schools nearby. 

The nearest main line railway stations are a short distance away at Tring and Berkhamsted from where you can link to all destinations throughout the UK. 

The nearest international airport London Luton Airport is a 25 minute drive away - Heathrow can be reached within a 30 mins. drive time

There are many entertainment venues and restaurants close by in Tring, Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead, with popular theatre&#x27;s in both Berkhamsted and Tring, with larger theaters in nearby Watford and Milton Keynes. The art deco Rex Cinema can also be found in Berkhamsted. 

The village is located in an area of outstanding natural beauty, adjoining Ashridge Forest to the west (where herds of wild deer roam) and close to Whipsnade Zoo to its east flank. The Grand Union canal is also not far away. 

The ancientIcknield Way Path passes through the village on its 110-mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes close to the village. The village is also on a popular route for road cyclists of all levels.

==Notable residents==
Tim Sherwood, a former professional footballer, lives on the edge of the village. He played for Watford, Norwich City, Blackburn Rovers, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth and Coventry City.

Graham Barber, retired FA referee, used to live in the village.

A number of films and television shows have been filmed around Dagnall, including &quot;First Knight&quot;, &quot;Dinotopia&quot;, &quot;Humans (TV series)&quot;, &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot;.

==Recent developments==
There have been many improvements made within the village over the last few years, the most notable being the building of a children&#x27;s play area and a running track around the recreation ground which is located towards the north of the village. There are also plans for the village hall to be extended within the near future.

More recently, red kites have been observed in increasing numbers and have become a common sight in the village.

<doc id="402796" wikidata="Q988761" url="?curid=402796" title="Denham, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Denham is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of Buckinghamshire, England, approximately 17 mi from central London, 2 mi northwest of Uxbridge and just north of junction 1 of the M40 motorway. The name is derived from the Old English for &quot;homestead in a valley&quot;. It was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Deneham&quot;. Denham contains the Buckinghamshire Golf Club.

==Buildings==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary has a flint and stone Norman tower and Tudor monuments. The tree-lined Village Road includes several old red brick houses with mature &quot;Wisteria&quot; on them, and has been used as a location in British films and television.

Southlands Manor is a Grade II listed building. Its entry on the English Heritage website states that it was built in the 16th century, with a variety of later changes including the addition of four chimney stacks in the early 17th-century. Analysis of a sample of timbers from the main building and its associated barn have found that they were felled in the winters of 1472/3 and 1473/4, indicating that the relevant parts of the building were erected in 1474 or soon after.

The Old Bakery, built in about C14, it is one of the earliest surviving buildings along the village High Street. It is located along what would have been medieval burgage plots. The plots were for laying out a town. Built for the Abbot of Westminster, probably on instructions by Nicholas de Littlington, for his reeve. One survey suggests a very precise date of building of 1367–68, although no dendrochronology has been undertaken. The building phases and outlay are complex, with much alteration. Prior to the 1950s demolition of the former E wing the building formed three cottages/shops.

Denham Film Studios were near the village and where famous films, including &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; were produced. The buildings were demolished in 1980 and the site re-landscaped as a business park and later as a site for luxury homes.

Bosch has its UK head office in Denham.

<text>Cinderford is a town and civil parish on the eastern fringe of the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, England. The population was 8,777 at the 2021 Census.

The town came into existence in the 19th century, following the rapid expansion of the Forest of Dean Coalfield and the construction of Cinderford Ironworks. Its origins can be seen in the style and layout of the town, with long rows of identical terraced housing similar to those found in the mining villages of the South Wales Valleys. The decline of the coal industry in the 1950s and 1960s significantly affected the town, as most of the male population was employed in mining.

==History==
The name &quot;Cinderford&quot;, used for a crossing-point, is recorded as early as 1258. The name reflects the site of early ironmaking which created deposits of cinders (clinker), sometimes in large mounds.

Following the construction of Cinderford Ironworks in the late 1700s, and the opening of large mines nearby, the town was laid out on a fairly conventional urban plan. In 1841 there were two inns and at least ten beerhouses in and around Cinderford. A new church was consecrated at Cinderford in 1844 and dedicated to St. John the Evangelist. By 1843 Cinderford also had a Baptist church which became by far the largest Baptist meeting in the Forest of Dean. Methodists and Primitive Methodists also had chapels in the area, and there was even an iron building which became known as the Ark, which was registered in 1886 by a group called the Blue Ribbon Gospel Army.

A coke-fired furnace was established in around 1797. It was situated 800 metres north of Cinderford bridge and used coke brought from Broadmoor, to the north, by a short canal. The furnace struggled to compete with iron furnaces elsewhere, and fell idle ten years later. It was revived in 1829 when new works on the old site were established by the Forest of Dean Iron Company, and in 1841 there were three furnaces producing 12,000 tons of iron a year and employing 100 men and boys. Only one furnace at the works was in blast in 1890 and the works closed in 1894.

By the 1840s Cinderford had a number of foundries and small engineering firms supplying the mining industry with machine parts, and it remained a centre for metal industries in the early 20th century.

For many years coal mining was the principal industry in the area. Lightmoor coal mine was being deepened in the late 1830s. Trafalgar colliery which was in production in 1860, was the only large mine in the coalfield run by free miners in the later 19th century. Trafalgar closed in 1925. A deep mine, called Northern United, was begun north-west of Cinderford in 1933, but Lightmoor, with a workforce of 600 in 1934, was the main colliery in the Cinderford area until it closed in 1940. There were still many smaller collieries in the Forest of Dean, employing 84.5 per cent of the adult male population in the Cinderford area, until the industry declined in the 1960s.

Iron ore mines were also worked near the town in the 19th century until the closure of the Cinderford ironworks led to the abandonment of Buckshaft and other ore mines near the town in 1899.

On 26 April 1889, four Frenchmen and their two tame bears were making their way to Ruardean, having performed in Cinderford. They were attacked by a mob, enraged by claims that the bears had killed a child and injured a woman. The bears were killed and the Frenchmen badly beaten. It soon became clear that the bears had not attacked anyone. Police proceedings followed, and 13 colliers and labourers appeared before magistrates at Littledean a week later, charged with ill-treating and killing the bears, and assaulting the Frenchmen. All but two were found guilty on one or more charges, with another convicted a week later. A total of £85 () was paid in fines. A subscription was also launched which generously compensated the Frenchmen. The question &quot;Who killed the bears?&quot; was used for many years as an insult, directed particularly towards the people of Ruardean, despite the fact that all those convicted were from Cinderford.Cinderford Town Trail has been created and researched by school pupils to celebrate the history of the town.

==Governance==
There are two electoral wards in Cinderford.

==Education==

===Primary===
Cinderford has three primary schools; Steam Mills Primary School, on Steam Mills Road, St. White&#x27;s Primary School, on St. Whites Road, and Forest View Primary School based on Latimer Road. Forest View Primary School is an amalgamation of the Latimer Junior School and the Bilson Infants&#x27; School (formerly on Station Street).

===Secondary===
Cinderford has a single, relatively small secondary school on Causeway Road, currently called The Forest High School but previously known as Heywood Community School. The school existed as Double View Secondary Modern School on a previous campus, on Woodville Road, but moved to the Causeway Road campus, in the early-mid-1970s. Until 1979 it was split between the two sites; in the mid-1980s it changed its name from Double View to Heywood Community School, and in 2012 it became an academy called Forest E-ACT Academy. The name changed again to Forest Academy in 2014 and to the current name in 2015.

===Tertiary===
Opened in 2018, Gloucestershire College is situated beside the Forest Vale Industrial Estate.

==Transport==
Cinderford&#x27;s High Street and Belle Vue Road lie on the A4151, which links with the A48 (Gloucester-Chepstow road) to the east.

In former times, Cinderford had a railway station that was opened by the Severn and Wye Railway and later run by the Great Western Railway and Midland Railway as Cinderford Joint railway station, but this was axed in 1958.

Cinderford is served by a regular bus service to Gloucester and Coleford; the bus station was dismantled in the late 1980s and no longer exists.

The closest airports are in Staverton (between Gloucester and Cheltenham), as well as Bristol Airport and Cardiff Airport.

==Religion==
The Church of England Benefice of Cinderford with Littledean consists of three parish churches. The parish church of St Stephen&#x27;s covers the central town and northern parts of Cinderford. The parish church of St John the Evangelist covers the south of Cinderford, Ruspidge and Soudley. The parish church of St Ethelbert&#x27;s Littledean is further down the hill and serves the community there.

==Media==

Dean Radio is a community station that broadcasts from the town. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;The Forester&quot;.

<doc id="402804" wikidata="Q2007406" url="?curid=402804" title="Dinton, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Dinton is a village in Buckinghamshire, England, within the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area. It is in the south of the Aylesbury Vale on the ancient turnpike leading from Aylesbury to Thame (although this road has since been diverted away from the village). It is within the civil parish of Dinton with Ford and Upton. The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Dunna&#x27;s estate&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was listed as &quot;Danitone&quot;.

==History==
There was an ancient mansion house in this parish that belonged to the Mayne family for many years (they were lords of the manor in 1086). This has long since disappeared, but the groundworks of the ancient manor house still remain and are a goldmine of archaeological finds. There is also a ruined mock-fortified building, Dinton Castle also known as Dinton Folly, though this was constructed much later (in 1769) by Sir John Vanhattem. This octagonal folly or &quot;sham castle&quot; is a Grade II listed building.

A BBC article stated that the building was beside a Saxon burial ground. Another source indicates that over the past centuries, and into the 20th century, various artifacts and skeletons had been found near the structure. That report also states that there are 14 other listed buildings nearby, including Dinton Hall. A full restoration of the &quot;castle&quot; was completed in 2018.
The 12th-century parish church of Saints Peter and Paul is a grade I listed building. John Harrison was the vicar here and his only child Henrietta Tindal (c.1817-1879) was a noted poet and writer. There is a memorial to the Royal Navy navigation expert Henry Raper in the church. 

Next to the church is Dinton Hall; this fine many-gabled mansion altered at various periods during its long history, was until the last quarter of the 20th century the seat of the Currie family and is now owned by the Vanbergen family. Following the Curries&#x27; departure it was bought by a Mr. Smith. He carried out a programme of restoration, and placed his own coat of arms above the mansion&#x27;s portals. Since 2004 the mansion is owned by the Vanbergen family, and they have restored the mansion and brought in new facilities.

A notable resident of Dinton in the seventeenth century was John Biggs, the Dinton Hermit, who lived in a cave in the village. He was involved in the execution of King Charles I on 30 January 1649 and was reputed to have been the actual executioner. As one of the regicides, Simon Mayne, lived at Dinton, and was after his death in imprisonment buried at Dinton in 1661, it is possible that the executioner would have been given sanctuary and anonymity on one of the regicide&#x27;s estates.

Within the parish border lay the hamlets of Westlington, Ford, Upton, Waldridge, Gibraltar and Aston Mullins.

There was also anciently a hamlet called Moreton in this parish, though today only the groundworks and ponds remain. This hamlet was wiped out sometime in the sixteenth century. The name mort / ton (death (fr) / town) could suggest that this settlement might have been wiped out and then subsequently abandoned after the inhabitants succumbed to the Black Death, but the usual derivation of the common name &#x27;Moreton&#x27; is &quot;town or settlement by a fen&quot;.

==Education==
Cuddington and Dinton Church of England School is a mixed Church of England primary school. It is a voluntary aided school that has been formed from the merger of Cuddington and Dinton schools. It takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school now has just over one hundred pupils.

==Sport==
Dinton is home to Dinton Cricket club, who have three senior teams playing in the Home Counties Premier Cricket League and Cherwell League, as well as junior age group teams from under 9s to under 17s. Dinton CC also compete in the National Village Cup, reaching the semi-final stage in 2013 and 2014.

<text>Upton-upon-Severn (or Upton on Severn, etc. and locally simply Upton) is a town and civil parish in the Malvern Hills District of Worcestershire, England. Lying on the A4104 (formerly A440), the 2021 census recorded a population of 2,903 for the town. 

Upton is situated on the west bank of the River Severn and is located southeast of Malvern. The town has a distinctive tower and copper-clad cupola – known locally as the &quot;Pepperpot&quot; – the only surviving remnant of the former church. Its replacement, also dedicated to St Peter and St Paul, was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield.

==History==
Until the later half of the 20th century, the bridge at Upton was the only one across the River Severn between Worcester and Tewkesbury; the present bridge was built in 1940. Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers crossed the Severn here to win the battle of Upton before the main Battle of Worcester in the English Civil War. The Upton-upon-Severn Memorial Hall was completed in 1832.

==Today==
The population of the civil parish in 2021 was recorded at 2,903- an increase from 2,881 in 2011. The parish extends westward from the town, including the settlement at Tunnel Hill, but does not include the village of Ryall located close to the town, on the other side of the river. Upton is in the West Worcestershire parliamentary constituency.

Upton lies on the banks of the River Severn and is known for its regular flooding. Low-lying areas of Upton suffered serious flooding in 2000. In the 2007 floods, levels exceeded those in 2000, and the town was inaccessible by road. The town&#x27;s main built up area lies on slightly higher ground than the surrounding countryside, and in the past became an island during severe floods. A connecting causeway now carries the A4104 above the floods to the west, and a viaduct on the other side of the bridge to the east.

The town has three major music festivals, with the spring folk festival, and the summer jazz and blues festivals.

Upton is the home of The White Lion Hotel, a 16th-century coaching inn, where parts of the building date back to 1510. The building has undergone many transformations over the centuries and is easily found on the high street due to its distinctive portico, adorned with its very own lion. Reputed to have played a part in the English Civil War, where soldiers from both sides are alleged to have enjoyed the hospitality of this popular local hostelry prior to the Battle of Worcester. Guests of the hotel can stay in rooms referred to in books VII and VIII of Henry Fielding&#x27;s classic 1749 novel &quot;Tom Jones&quot; in which he refers to the hotel as &quot;A house of exceeding good repute&quot;; these rooms retain many of their original features.

==Education==

Primary education is provided by Upton-upon-Severn CofE Primary School with approximately 194 (in 2019) pupils on its roll. Hanley Castle High School, located in a nearby village, provides secondary education for the region.

==People==
*John Dee, mathematician, astronomer and astrologer, was presented the lay rectorship of Upton upon Severn in 1553.
*Nigel Mansell, Formula One world champion, born at Baughton near Upton.
*Admiral Sir William Tennant (1890–1963), born in Upton.
*General Sir George Alexander Weir (1876–1951), born in Upton

==Transport==

Upton used to be served by Upton-on-Severn railway station, on a branch line Tewkesbury and Malvern Railway from Ashchurch to Malvern, with the intermediate stations Tewkesbury, Ripple, Worcestershire, Upton upon Severn and Malvern Wells (Hanley Road). The Upton to Malvern section closed in December 1952 and the rest in August 1961, before the Beeching Axe.

Bus services 332 and 363 link Upton to Worcester a total of six times per day (Mon-Fri), with four per day on Saturdays.

Although the M5 motorway is close by, the nearest motorway junction is Junction 1 of the M50 (which is from J8 of the M5).

Upton Marina is home to Mercia Inshore Search and Rescue.

<doc id="402815" wikidata="Q1605727" url="?curid=402815" title="Dorton">
<text>Dorton (or Dourton) is a village and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire. It is in the western part of the county, about north of the Oxfordshire market town of Thame.

==Manor==
The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;farm at a narrow pass&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as &quot;Dortone&quot;, and in the 13th century it was &quot;Durtone&quot;.

Before the Norman conquest of England Alric, son of Goding, a thegn of Edward the Confessor, held the manor of Dorton. However, the Domesday Book records that by 1086 the Norman baron Walter Giffard held it.

Dorton House is a Grade I listed Jacobean mansion to the south of the village. It is now a preparatory school, Ashfold School.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of Saint John the Evangelist was originally a chapel of ease to nearby Chilton. St. John&#x27;s has been a parish in its own right since at least 1590.

The nave and chancel of the church building may be 12th century, as is the bowl of the font. There is a 13th-century lancet window in the nave. The south porch was added in the 13th century, es evidenced by a blocked window of that date in its east wall. In the 14th century the Decorated Gothic south aisle was added, the chancel arch was at least partly rebuilt and the present east window and piscina were added. The present stained glass in the east window is 15th century. The present entrance arch to the porch was added in the 15th century, the base of the font is from the same century and the Perpendicular Gothic window in the south wall of the south aisle was added in about 1480.

St. John&#x27;s has three bells hung in a timber-framed bell-cot, plus a small Sanctus bell. Bartholomew Atton of Buckingham cast the tenor bell in 1604 and Robert Atton cast the second bell in 1626. John Taylor and Sons cast the treble bell in 1828, presumably at the bell-foundry they then had at Oxford.

==Economic and social history==
Dorton Spa, a chalybeate spring, is north of the village in Spa Wood. A large pump room and health spa were opened in about 1840 but due to lack of Royal patronage (unlike Royal Leamington Spa and Royal Tunbridge Wells) Dorton Spa declined. Little exists of it now.

The Great Western Railway had the &quot;Bicester cut-off&quot; railway built through the parish in 1910. The line passes within a few yards of the village, and in 1937 the GWR opened to serve it. British Railways closed the halt in 1963. The railway is now part of the Chiltern Main Line.

Dorton was noted in the 1960s and 1970s for the tug-of-war team the Dorton Dons.

<text>Downley is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, which was included in Wycombe district before its abolition. It is high in the Chiltern Hills, overlooking the town of High Wycombe, although today it is almost indistinguishable from the urban spread of the latter town.

The central part of the parish is the common, this extends over about . It is part of the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Downley was originally within the 1890s civil parish of West Wycombe, however, in the 1930s West Wycombe village was incorporated into the Borough of High Wycombe and the remainder of the original civil West Wycombe Parish, which included Downley, became known as West Wycombe Rural Detached Parish. Due to Local Government reorganisation in the 1980s West Wycombe Rural Detached Parish was split into two civil Parishes, one of which was Downley Parish, the other being Piddington &amp; Wheeler End. Downley was once three hamlets, Downley was the largest, with Littleworth and Plummer&#x27;s Green on its south side. Both of these have now been incorporated into Downley as a whole, but there are still names such as Littleworth Road and Plomer Hill. Plomer is a derivative from Plummer.

Downley was extensively built up in the 1950s-1960s and is still changing now, with the parish boundary being extended.

The Memorial Hall, also known as the Village Hall, in the High Street was built in 1923 and is still in use. The old School, built in the 1870s is also still in use. There were also furniture making factories in the village as well as home workshops; a practice which was common in the Chilterns as High Wycombe and surrounding towns were large producers of furniture, in particular chairs from the Industrial Revolution onwards.

Downley was once home to several farms, the largest of these stopped working in the 1990s but can be plainly seen from commonside with its huge barns and unusual listed farm house.

==Toponym==
The toponym &quot;Downley&quot; is derived from the Old English words &quot;dun&quot; (&quot;wood&quot;) or &quot;down&quot; (&quot;hill&quot;) and &quot;lea&quot; (&quot;clearing&quot;). This indicates that the Anglo-Saxons found this area of the Chilterns to be wooded and that Downley was a clearing.

==The Common==
One of the few Chiltern commons that has remained open in the area, rather than become wooded. The common was once part of an Anglo-Saxon tithing, or group of ten dwellings.

Something else that makes this common unusual is the way it has been changed by its industrial past. The biggest change in its landscape is the excavation of clay, chalk and flint from all over the common, this has left behind pits, called dells, some very large and deep. The reason the clay was extracted is slightly vague but is most likely for making bricks and tiles. The smaller pits that are round, usually made on a boundary ditch are saw pits. These are identifiable as the spoil heap is on the downward slope.

Also noticeable, mainly in the woods are ancient parish boundaries. These once separated the land between Hughenden and West Wycombe parishes.

During World War II the Army used the common to test and repair Churchill tanks. The tracks are still visible, but are hard to make out, on the common today. Downley Common was used as a golf course for a short while, hence the name of Golf Link Cottages and the Bricklayers Arms once being called the Golf Links.

At the top of the common next to the cricket pavilion there is a small but distinct Blacksmiths Forge. This was still in use up until the early 1990s. Downley is also home to the rare starfruit flower which has been known to grow on Mannings Pond.

The welfare of the common is maintained by the Downley Common Preservation Society.

Downley Common also plays host to a number of sports clubs, mainly Downley Cricket Club and Downley Albion Football Club.

==History==
The oldest house in the village, Blacksmiths Cottage is situated on the top end of the common, dates from the 12th or 13th century. The oldest pub in Downley is The Le De (not Lady) Spencers Arms at the very top of the common. It&#x27;s known to the locals as the Lee Dee, The Shed or the Top Pub. The building dates from the 17th century and was once a bakery. It is believed to have been a watering hole for drovers who passed through from Wales on their way to London.

West Wycombe estate still leaves its mark on Downley life, there is a large, regular shoot, mostly held on Saturdays during hunting season. This is managed by Cookshall Farm, which is in the parish at the very top end.

==Folklore and events==
Downley has a few interesting road names, such as &quot;Bug Alley&quot; which is now Moor Lane, Coffin Lane which is at the end of Moor Lane and leads to Hughenden Church. Kiln Pond Lane, where apparently a horse and cart reputedly ran into the Kiln Pond.

Downley traditions include the Guy Fawkes Night torch parade, where literally hundreds of people march up the common with tin can torches and throw then into the bonfire. Also there are two Village fetes, one being Downley day and the other being the Jolities which is the older. Downley also claims a strong sporting heritage. With well established cricket and football teams who use the cricket pitch and newly gained space next to Mannings field.

==Schools==
The Downley School (or TDS) is a combined school in Downley with &#x27;Inadequate&#x27; (Ofsted), which teaches pupils from ages 4–11 (Years 1–6 in the British educational system).

==Football Club==
Downley has several local football teams ranging from junior side Downley Dynamos all the way up to the oldest club in the village, Downley Albion Football Club formed in 1885.
Both the Dynamos and Albion play home games at Downley Common and share the sports pavilion which is also used by the local cricket team.

<text>Drayton Beauchamp (pronounced &#x27;Beecham&#x27;) is a village and civil parish within Aylesbury Vale district in Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the east of the county bordering Hertfordshire, about six miles from Aylesbury and two miles from Tring.

==History==
The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;farm where sledges are used&quot;. It is a common place name in England, and refers to places that were perched on the hillside, thus requiring the use of a sledge rather than a cart to pull heavy loads. The suffix &#x27;Beauchamp&#x27; refers to the ancient manorial family of the parish. The village is intersected by the Icknield Way a prehistoric, long-distance trackway of significant importance in providing a trading route between East Anglia and the Thames Valley certainly during the Iron Age and maybe earlier. In more recent times it has been bisected by the Roman Road, Akeman Street now the A41 and by both the Aylesbury Arm and Wendover Arm of the Grand Union Canal.

Following the Norman conquest of England William I awarded land which later became known as Drayton Beauchamp to Robert, Earl of Morton who as Magno le Breton had accompanied William at the time of the Norman Invasion in 1066. The Morton family founded a church at Drayton on the site where the present-day church of St Mary the Virgin now stands. During the early part of the 13th century the manor was owned by William de Beauchamp (de Bello Campo). The lands were passed from the Beauchamp family to the Cobhams. Sir John Cobham gave the property to King Edward III. The King granted it to his shield-bearer Thomas Cheney (also spelt Cheyne) in 1364. It remained in the Cheyne family until the death of William Cheyne, Lord Viscount Newhaven in 1728.

During the period after 1066 in which the Lord of the Manor of Drayton was Magno le Breton the southern end of the manor would have been valued for its summer pasture. This area which became known later as Cholesbury contained a large Iron Age Hillfort. This gradually became a permanent settlement and was subsequently separated off as a separate manor. In 1541 it was sold by Robert Cheyne to Chief Justice John Baldwin and became an autonomous manor.

Drayton Beauchamp was sold by the Cheyne family to John Gumley in 1728 for £22,200 and in 1788 the Lordship of the Manor was inherited by Lady Robert Manners. The manor house beside the church had been demolished around 1760 and a new one built elsewhere in the parish by the Gumleys. In 1835 the Lordship of the Manor passed to Mrs. Caroline Jenney and remained in that family until the death of Miss Airmyne Harpur-Crewe in 1999.

==Parish church of St Mary==
The parish church was extensively rebuilt in the 15th century from materials salvaged from an earlier church. Most notable is the Norman font which dates back to the 12th century. The first rector of the new Church was Richard Hooker who took up his incumbency in 1584. Richard is today remembered for his writings in particular a four-volume work known as &quot;Of the Lawes of Ecclesiastical Politie&quot;.

The church was again restored in 1867 when the rector was the parson-naturalist, Henry Harpur Crewe.

In 1934 Drayton Beauchamp ceded a small parcel of land, adjacent to the previously detached parish of Cholesbury to the new parish of Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards.

<doc id="402823" wikidata="Q760893" url="?curid=402823" title="Jolof Empire">
<text>The Jolof Empire (), also known as Great Jolof, or the Wolof Empire, was a Wolof state that ruled parts of West Africa situated in modern-day Senegal, Mali, Gambia and Mauritania from around the 12th century to 1549. Following the 1549 battle of Danki, its vassal states were fully or &quot;de facto&quot; independent; in this period it is known as the Jolof Kingdom.

==Origins==
Wolof oral traditions relate that the Wolof were the earliest inhabitants of the region that became Jolof, which was named after a local chief Jolof Mbengue. The empire consisted mostly of Wolof, Serer and Fula from north of the Senegal River. The region was ruled by Lamanes of the Mbengue, Diaw and Ngom families. They were related to early rulers of neighboring kingdoms such as Baol.

Jolof was a vassal of the Mali Empire for much of its early history. It remained within that empire&#x27;s sphere of influence until the latter half of the 14th century.

==Ndiadiane Ndiaye ==
Traditional accounts among the Wolof agree that the founder of the state was the possibly mythical Ndiadiane Ndiaye (also spelled Njaajaan Njaay or Njai). Sallah writes: &quot;Some say that Njajan was the son of Abu Darday, an Almoravid conqueror who came from Mecca to preach Islam in Senegal ... Some say that Ndiadiane Ndiaye was a mysterious person of Fulani origin. Others say he was a Serer prince.&quot; In general, Ndiaye is given an Almoravid Islamic lineage and a link on his mother&#x27;s side to the state of Takrur. James Searing adds that &quot;In all versions of the myth, Njaajaan Njaay speaks his first words in Pulaar rather than Wolof, emphasizing once again his character as a stranger of noble origins.&quot;

The legend of Ndiadiane Ndiaye has many variations in detail, but these share some important commonalities. It begins when his father dies and his mother remarries with a slave. This match so enfuriated Ndiaye that he jumped into the Senegal River and began an aquatic life. He made his way downstream to Waalo. At this time, the area was divided into villages ruled by separate &quot;Lamanes&quot;, some of whom were engaged in a dispute over a wood near a prominent lake (in some versions, it is a dispute over a catch of fish). This almost led to bloodshed, but it was stopped by the mysterious appearance of a stranger from the lake. The stranger divided the wood fairly and disappeared, leaving the people in awe. The people then feigned a second dispute and kidnapped the stranger when he returned. They offered him the kingship of their land. When these events were reported to the ruler of the Kingdom of Sine, Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali, also a great magician, he is reported to have exclaimed &quot;Ndiadiane Ndiaye&quot; in his native Serer language in amazement. He then suggested that all rulers between the Senegal River and the Gambia River voluntarily submit to this man, which they did.

===Dating===
Attempting to date Ndiadiane Ndiaye and the establishment of the Jolof Empire, John Donnelly Fage suggests, &quot;the rise of the empire was associated with the growth of Wolof power at the expense of the ancient Sudanese state of Takrur, and that this was essentially a fourteenth-century development.&quot; Ogot proposes that the Jolof became permanently independent during a succession dispute in 1360 between two rival lineages within the Mali Empire. There is no consensus among scholars, however.

==Imperial History==

The earliest centuries of Jolof&#x27;s history are known only through oral histories, but few details have survived. During the relatively dry period (c. 1100–1500) the Jolof empire expanded soutwards and westwards, progressively &#x27;Wolofizing&#x27; the ruling classes. The smaller states thus incorporated into the empire. The states of Cayor and Baol, which were founded around the same time as Jolof, were absorbed early on. Many of the earliest &quot;buurbas&quot; came from maternal lineages native to Baol. The Kingdom of Sine and an early form of the Kingdom of Saloum were absorbed in the late 14th century at the earliest. This completed the core constituent states of the Jolof confederacy: Cayor, Baol and Waalo, and the Serer states of Sine and Saloum.

===Apex===
Beginning in the 1440s, Portuguese ships began to visit the coast, initially looking to capture slaves but soon shifting to trade. The Jolof expansion may have been assisted by the purchase of horses from these traders. At this time, Jolof was at the height of its power. 

&quot;Buurba&quot; Biram Njeme Eler, or possibly Cukli Njiklaan, conquered Namandirou in approximately the 1450s, then extended extended his authority over Takrur. Eler moved the capital from Njiayeen Sabur to Thieung. He was also likely responsible for subduing the Mandinka states on the northern bank of the Gambia, including Niumi, Badibu, Nyani, and Wuli, as the Mali Empire declined. Jolof would also expand its control over the gold trade, conquering Gajaaga and subsequently Bambuk, although Jean Boulègue argues of such conquest being very unlikely. Control over the kingdoms of the Gambia also gave the Buurba some access to the growing commerce there.

===Succession Disputes===
Upon &quot;Buurba&quot; Biram Njeme Eler&#x27;s death, the succession was disputed between his son, Bokar Bige, and his nephew Tase Daagulen. The latter was eventually victorious, with the help of Brak Cukuli Mbooj of Waalo. This conflict was, in a way, a contest between a patrilineal inheritance system (father-son) and a matrilineal one (uncle-nephew), as Biram Eler and Tase Daagulen were both members of the Jonai matrilineage. Between roughly 1455 and 1489, five &quot;buurba&quot;s would claim the throne, sowing chaos and civil war.
In the 1480s, Jelen, the buumi or prince, was ruling the empire in the name of his brother Birayma Kuran Kan, known in Portuguese sources as Bur Birao. Tempted by the Portuguese trade, he moved the seat of government to the coast to take advantage of the new economic opportunities. Other princes, opposed to this policy, deposed and murdered the &quot;buurba&quot; in 1489. Jelen escaped and sought refuge with the Portuguese, who took him to Lisbon. There he exchanged gifts with King John II and was baptized. Faced with the opportunity to put a Christian ally on the throne, John II sent an expeditionary force under a Portuguese commander to put the prince back on the throne of Jolof. The objective was to put him on the throne and a fort at the mouth of the Senegal River. Neither goal was achieved. A dispute between the commander and the prince resulted in the former accusing the bumi of treachery and killing him.

In the early 16th century, the Jolof Empire was still very powerful, and capable of fielding 100,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. But succession disputes were not the only thing tearing it apart. The Atlantic Trade trade, for instance, had brought extra wealth to the empire, but with Jelen&#x27;s failure the rulers of the vassal states on the coast got the lion&#x27;s share of the benefits, which eventually allowed them to eclipse and undermine the emperor. Jolof was located far from the coast, and had no direct access to maritime trade.

There was also the matter of external forces, such as the breakup of the Mali Empire. Mali&#x27;s slipping grip on its far-flung empire had allowed Jolof to become an empire in the first place. But now conflict was spreading to Jolof&#x27;s northern territories. In 1513, Koli Tenguella led a strong force of Fulani and Mandinka into Futa Toro, seizing it from the Jolof and setting up his dynasty, and also destroying Namandirou. In 1520 the Serer kingdoms of Sine and Saloum in the south broke away.

===Battle of Danki and disintegration===

In 1549, Kayor successfully broke from the Jolof Empire under the leadership of the crown prince Amari Ngoone Sobel Fall by defeating Jolof at the Battle of Danki. The battle caused a ripple effect resulting in Waalo and Baol also leaving the empire. By 1600, the Jolof Empire was effectively over. Kayor invaded its southern neighbor, Bawol, and began forming a personal union of its own. Jolof was reduced to a kingdom; nevertheless, the title of Burba remained associated with imperial prestige and commanded nominal respect from its ancient vassals.

==Society==
Jolof society harbored a developed hierarchical system involving different classes of royal and non-royal nobles, free men, occupational castes, and slaves. Occupational castes included blacksmiths, jewelers, tanners, tailors, musicians, and &quot;griots&quot;. Smiths were important to the society for their ability to make weapons of war as well as their trusted status for mediating disputes fairly. Griots were employed by every important family as chroniclers and advisors, without whom much of early Jolof history would be unknown. Jolof&#x27;s nobility were nominally animists, but some combined this with Islam. However, Islam had not dominated Wolof society until about the 19th century, when the empire had long been reduced to a rump state in the form of the Kingdom of Jolof.

===Women===
Throughout the different classes, intermarriage was rarely allowed. Women could not marry upwards, and their children did not inherit the father&#x27;s superior status. However, women had some influence and role in government. The &quot;Lingeer&quot; was head of all women and very influential in state politics. She owned several villages that cultivated farms and paid tribute directly to her. There were also other female chiefs whose main task was judging cases involving women. In the empire&#x27;s most northern state of Walo, women could aspire to the office of &quot;Bur&quot; and rule the state.

==Economy==
Isolated from the main maritime and trans-Saharan trade routes, the economy of Jolof proper was relatively simple. Moor or Jula merchants were the main carriers of trade, which was organized around weekly markets and consisted mostly of millet, salt, beans, cattle and other essentials. Coinage was not used, but iron bars and cloth served as universal means of exchange.

==Political organization==
The ruler of Jolof was known as the &quot;Bour ba&quot; or &quot;Buurba&quot;, who was selected by a college of electors that included the rulers of the five main constituent kingdoms. Although nominally the head of the entire empire, the &quot;Buurba&quot; directly controlled a relatively small portion of Jolof; Lamanes held a lot of power, and became progressively more independent as the royal family became more consumed by succession disputes.

Once appointed, officeholders went through elaborate rituals to both familiarize themselves with their new duties and elevate them to a divine status. From then on, they were expected to lead their states to greatness or risk being declared unfavored by the gods and being deposed. The stresses of this political structure resulted in a very autocratic government where personal armies and wealth often superseded constitutional values.

===Relations with Constituent Kingdoms===
The Jolof Empire included five coastal kingdoms from north to south: Waalo, Kayor, Baol, Sine and Saloum. All of these states were tributary to the land-locked state of Jolof. Each was governed by a ruler were chosen by their respective nobles. Each had practical autonomy but was expected to cooperate with the &quot;Bour&quot; on important matters, and send regular tribute to Jolof. This did not always happen, however, and wars between the constituent kingdoms were common; provinces could gain or lose degrees of independence, or move from one king&#x27;s control to another.

<doc id="402825" wikidata="Q2620203" url="?curid=402825" title="Drayton Parslow">
<text>Drayton Parslow is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, about south of Bletchley, within the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area. In the 2001 census the parish had a population of 596, increasing at the 2011 census to 614.

==Toponym==
In the 11th century the toponym was &quot;Draintone&quot; or &quot;Draitone&quot;. This is derived from Old English and means &quot;farm where sledges are used&quot;. It is a common English toponym for places that were on a hillside, where a sledge rather than a cart was needed for heavy loads. By the 13th century it had become &quot;Draitone Passele&quot;, referring to the Passelewe family, who tenanted the manor of Drayton from the latter part of the 11th century. It evolved through &quot;Draygtone Passelewe&quot; in the 14th century and &quot;Draighton Perselow&quot; in the 17th century before reaching its current form.

==Manor==
In the reign of Edward the Confessor in the 11th century, Lewin de Nuneham held a manor of two hides and one virgate at Drayton. After the Norman conquest of England Lewin was displaced as feudal overlord by the Norman Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances. De Montbray tried unsuccessfully to displace the Passelewes as his tenants, and the family retained Drayton until 1379 when it passed by marriage to the Purcell family. In 1461 it was conveyed to a descendant of the Passelewes, William Laycon, in whose family it then remained until at least 1570.

In Edward the Confessor&#x27;s reign, two brothers held a second, smaller manor of three virgates at Drayton. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 William I&#x27;s half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux held the fief of this manor. However, Odo was tried for fraud in 1076 and disgraced again in 1082 for acting without Royal authority, and his extensive estates were eventually escheated to the Crown. Odo&#x27;s Drayton manor was annexed to the Honour of Ampthill in Bedfordshire. In 1562 it was linked with the manor of East Greenwich, and the last record of overlordship of this manor is dated 1607.

==Church and chapels==
===Church of England===

The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity contains fragments of 12th-century masonry. The first known documentary record of the parish church is from 1232. The chancel was rebuilt in the 14th century in the Decorated Gothic style. In the 15th century the nave was rebuilt and the west tower was built or rebuilt in the Perpendicular Gothic style. Of the same period are the Perpendicular Gothic hexagonal baptismal font, the three-light east window of the chancel, a 15th-century alabaster relief above the altar depicting the Crucifixion of Jesus and fragments of 15th-century stained glass in the windows. In the 16th century the south porch was added. In 1863 the church was restored and the chancel was extended about eastwards, re-using the Perpendicular east window in the new position. Holy Trinity is now a Grade II* listed building.

By 1925 Holy Trinity had a ring of three bells. Bartholomew Atton of Buckingham cast the tenor bell in 1591. John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough, who at the time also had a foundry at Oxford, cast the treble and second bell in 1842. In 1935 these became the fourth and fifth bells as John Taylor &amp; Co cast a new treble, second and third bells, increasing the ring to six.

Holy Trinity has also a Sanctus bell that was cast in 1669 by Anthony Chandler, who worked at his family&#x27;s bell-foundry in the village (see below).

Holy Trinity parish is now part of the Benefice of Newton Longville, Mursley, Swanbourne, Little Horwood and Drayton Parslow.

Drayton Rectory is a Georgian house of five bays built in 1753 or 1754.

Holy Trinity Church has been Grade II* listed (Entry Number: 1289256) since 19 August 1959.
The summary states: &quot;Fragments of C12 masonry, C14 chancel, C15 nave and W. tower,C16 S. porch. All much restored C19&quot;.

===Baptist===
Drayton Baptist Chapel was built in 1830. Worship at the chapel is now on alternate Sunday mornings.

===Methodist===
Drayton&#x27;s first Primitive Methodist chapel was built in 1847. In 1912 it was replaced with a new Gothic Revival red brick chapel, and in 1932 it became part of the Methodist Union. Drayton&#x27;s Methodist congregation declined in the 1960s and 70s, and in 1984 the chapel was sold and converted into a private house.

==History==
The settlement is recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) which lists 18 households. In later years, the top end of the village became known as Hog End and later, Church End. Until the 1800s, most residents worked in agriculture.
===Bell-foundry===
Drayton Parslow had a bell-foundry from 1635 to 1754. It was started by Richard I Chandler and run by members of his family for the next 91 years. In 1726 Edward Hall took over, and continued the business until 1754. By early 1800, the business was no longer in operation, probably because of increasing competition.

Reports indicate that 163 bells that were cast by founders from Drayton Parslow are known to survive. Examples in Buckinghamshire include bells at St James, Aston Abbotts, St Nicholas, Ickford and St Giles, Pitchcott and the Sanctus bell at St John the Evangelist, Whitchurch. There are also examples in Oxfordshire including at The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Beckley, St Michael&#x27;s, Fringford, St Mary the Virgin, Kidlington and SS Peter and Paul, Steeple Aston and the Sanctus bells at St Mary, Chesterton and St Nicholas&#x27;, Emmington. An example in Northamptonshire is at St James the Less, Sulgrave.

===World War I and II===
Residents of the village were involved in both world wars. The village has a memorial obelisk that states: &quot;Commemoration First World War (1914-1918), Second World War (1939-1945)&quot; at the junction of Main Road and Chapel Lane.

According to Historic England, the village was also a World War II outstation to the Government Code and Cipher School at Bletchley Park; some of the work was moved here in 1943 when the group needed more space. Another source indicates that the buildings were also used as a prisoner of war camp, and after the war, as a hostel for displaced persons and those employed at the brick works. After the war, the Post Office used some of the buildings as a training centre. By the late 1980s the site had been redeveloped; a housing estate is now located there, Prospect Close.

==Amenities==
Drayton Parslow Village School is a mixed, community, infant school, which educates children between the ages of four and seven and has about 45 pupils. Since 2007 the school has been in a partnership sharing a single headteacher with the schools in Mursley and Swanbourne. Many parish children older than seven go to Swanbourne C of E School, the Junior school of the Three Schools, while others travel to Stewkley or Winslow.

Drayton Parslow has a public house, The Three Horseshoes. The community has a village hall (Greenacre Hall), a Sports and Social Club, and a recreation field with playground and cricket pitch. A MUGA (multi-use games area) is located beside the village hall. The village school educates children to Year 3; Schools are located in the nearby communities for Grade 4 to 7.

In 2004, part of the village was declared a Conservation Area &quot;of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve
or enhance&quot;.

<doc id="402826" wikidata="Q848554" url="?curid=402826" title="Tambacounda region">
<text>Tambacounda, formerly known as &quot;Sénégal Oriental&quot;, is a region of Senegal. It used to be part of the Mali Empire before the borders were created to separate Mali from Senegal. Tambacounda is physically the largest of Senegal&#x27;s 14 regions, but is sparsely populated and its economy lags behind the rest of the country. The department of Kédougou was separated from Tambacounda in 2008, and became a separate region.

==Departments==
Tambacounda region is divided into 4 departments:
*Bakel département
*Goudiry département
*Koumpentoum département
*Tambacounda département

==Geography==
Tambacounda is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

==Culture==
Tambacounda is famous for its rich djembe and dance culture and heritage. Some of the greatest djembe masters from Segu, Mali came to Tambacounda in the mid 1900s, bringing with them their history, knowledge, and secrets of the djembe. Its official language is French, but Wolof is more widely spoken in Sénégal.

Much knowledge of djembe history was transmitted directly to djembe master Abdoulaye Diakité by his master teacher Suncaru Jara. Jara&#x27;s teacher was Chebleni Traore whose teacher, Numuni Traore, was the first djembe master to bring the djembe out of Bamana secrecy, igniting its diaspora.

The diaspora of the djembe also occurred because there were too many djembe masters in Tambacounda at that time, pressuring some to move on to different towns or countries. Diakité significantly influenced the djembe&#x27;s diaspora, first by touring worldwide with the National Ballet of Senegal for 18 years as their lead soloist, in addition to his later work in the 1990s running the Tambacounda West African Drum and Dance Camp in the Bay Area.

In light of its rich cultural heritage and location, Tambacounda is today known as a djembe &quot;proving ground&quot;, since one never knows who might be passing through. This has had the effect of keeping the local djembe players on their toes, by playing according to tradition. Even in the face of globalization, djembe performances have remained predominantly traditional in Tambacounda.

In 2019, Italian artist Giovanni Hänninen launched a project called People of Tamba, consisting of 200 portraits taken across the Tambacounda region in Senegal exhibited at Also Known as Africa (AKAA) art and design fair, 8-11 November 2019. Inspired by German photographer August Sander’s seminal work, People of the 20th Century, People of Tamba was conceived as dignified portrait of the society of Tambacounda, the largest city in the most remote and rural region of Senegal, and the point of departure for the majority of Senegalese migration, with the aim to counter negative and number-based reporting about migration in western media by bringing individuals and their personal stories to the fore.

==Notable people==

* Moutarou Baldé
* Abdoulaye Bathily
* Clément Cailleau
* Abdou Karim Camara
* Seydou Cissokho
* Karim Coulibaly
* Mohamed Coulibaly (footballer, born 1988)
* Abdoulaye Diakité
* Sidiki Kaba
* Aïda Mbaye
* Mame Bassine Niang
* Nafi Toure

==Economy==
The economy of Tambacounda is based primarily on agriculture, with cash crops including cotton and peanuts. Mining plays a role in the southern part of the region around the city of Kedougou. The region is also home to the Niokolo-Koba National Park, the largest reserve in western Africa, which supports another leg of Tambacounda&#x27;s economy, tourism.

<text>Lev Mikhaylovich Dovator ( 19 December 1941) was a famous Soviet major general who was killed in action during World War II and posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

==Life==
Born in 1903, Dovator came from a Belarusian Jewish peasant family. In 1922, he was elected to be Secretary of Komsomol Committee of Khotino village. He joined the Red Army in 1924 and went on to become an officer after graduating from cavalry school and a military academy. In 1926 he attended Borisoglebsk-Leningrad Cavalry Commanders School, graduating in 1929 to become a platoon commander in the 27th Cavalry regiment, 5th Cavalry Division. In October 1933, he was posted with the 1st Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, as a commissar. From May 1935 to May 1936, Colonel Dovator was commissar of the Independent Reconnaissance Battalion of the 93rd Rifle Division. He attended Frunze Military Academy in 1939, and during the early months of the war, Dovator was with the Western Front Headquarters. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was a colonel in charge of a brigade of Cossack cavalry.

==Operation Barbarossa==

At the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was posted as Chief of Staff of the Red Army&#x27;s 36th Cavalry Division. In July 1941, he won the Order of the Red Banner for bravery in the defensive battles at the Solovyo crossing of the Dniepr. Colonel Dovator conducted a successful fighting withdrawal, crossing a bridge over the river just before the Germans captured it. In August 1941 he was given command of a cavalry group consisting of the 50th and 53rd Cavalry Divisions. General Lev Dovator&#x27;s 50th and 53rd Cavalry divisions were raised exclusively from Kuban Cossacks. Despite his Jewish heritage, unique with the Cossacks, they accepted Dovator as one of their own and considered him a great leader, superb horseman, and master of sabre.

By mid-August, German troops reached the Mezha River. On August 13, Dovator received orders to raid the German rear and disrupt preparations for their next advance. Out of his two divisions of 4,500 men he took 3,000 Cossacks. The group was concentrated in the vicinity of Pozhano, Formino, and Budnits. By mid-August, they were assembled in a swampy and forested region 20 km/12 miles east of Zharkovskii, well behind and beyond the 30th Army&#x27;s right flank. For a week, Dovator&#x27;s Cossacks repeatedly probed the German defenses, seeking to infiltrate. The cavalry pressed its advance into the German rear in a dispersed formation, traveling along cart roads and forest trails. Thanks to excellent reconnaissance his cavalry for 10 days smashed the German rear. During this time they killed more than 2,500 troops of the Wehrmacht, 200 vehicles, and 7 tanks. The famous artists of the Moscow circus from the team of Mikhail Tuganov notably served in this unit. They were reportedly able to shoot standing on the back of a galloping horse or, conversely, by firing from underneath its belly, which influenced the development among Germans of the myth of the &quot;wild Russian&quot;. 

The formation created an illusion that their riding force was much larger than 3,000 sabres, which had a great psychological effect on the Germans. Squadrons unexpectedly materialized from dense forests to cut communication wires, attack supply convoys and isolate German garrisons, only to vanish back into the forests. Once liberated, villagers reported that they had heard from the Germans that 100,000 Cossacks had broken through German lines. Dovator&#x27;s deception was clearly effective. He soon became the commander of a cavalry group, and in August–September 1941 this cavalry group executed the most daring raid through rear areas of the German army in the vicinity of Smolensk. Dovator&#x27;s famous raid in early 1941 was conducted with only 3000 sabres and sixty-five machine guns carried on packhorses. The Germans after the raid appointed an award amounting to 100,000 Marks for his head. On 11 September 1941, he was promoted to major general for this action.

==Battle of Moscow==

On November 20, his unit became the 3rd Cavalry Corps due to its enormous battlefield success. On 27 November, however, it was renamed the 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps. During the Battle of Moscow, Dovator was the commander of 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps, which fended off the enemy advance at Volokolamsk.

He was killed in an offensive action on 19 December 1941, near the outskirts of Ruza. He was reportedly cut down by machine-gun fire while crawling towards a forward position to get a better look near the village of Palashkino.

Dovator was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union two days afterwards, as well as the Order of Lenin. He was replaced in command by Major General Issa Pliyev. Lev Dovator is buried alongside Ivan Panfilov, as they fought together to stop the 9th Army (Wehrmacht) from reaching Moscow.

<text>Thiès is a region of western Senegal. The capital is also called Thiès.

==Geography==
Thiès has two coastlines, one in the north with the Grande Côte housing the Niayes vegetable market, one to the south with the Petite Côte, one of the tourist areas of Senegal.
Principally the main passageway between the peninsula and the rest of the country, the region of Thiès has received a communication route connected to the first rail line and new road infrastructure.
Thiès is relatively small, yet it is the most populous region after Dakar, with a population of 2,467,523 inhabitants in 2023.

The coastal communities are dependent on fishing, growing crops, and coastal tourism for subsistence. The interior of the region was the peanut basin. Phosphates are also mined there.

==History==

The Thiès Region has always been occupied by the Serer people since the ancient Serers and their ancestors. However, in the pre-colonial period, more so around the 16th century, the Wolof immigrants among others have settled in. Like the Fatick Region, the entire Thiès Region is strongly Serer and one of the most important of Serer country. It is also where many of the Serer sacred and historical sites are found. The area is well represented by the Cangin, a sub-group of the Serers, who had a fierce reputation for protecting their country from outsiders in precolonial times as well as during the colonial-era (see Timeline of Serer history and Serer medieval history).

Geographically, the region partially overlaps with the precolonial Kingdoms of Cayor and Baol. The Kingdom of Baol was ruled by the Joof family for several centuries until 1549. During the colonial-era, its development was supported by the railway line - the Dakar-Saint-Louis railway in the late nineteenth century, and then with the Dakar-Niger railway. Thus Administratively, it is one of the oldest in the country.

==Administrative divisions==
Thiès region is divided into 3 departments (départements), 14 communes (soon 15 communes in 2023), 12 arrondissements, 32 communautés rurales and 3 communes d&#x27;arrondissement.

<text>The Department of Health and Social Security (commonly known as the DHSS) was a ministry of the British government in existence for twenty years from 1968 until 1988, and was headed by the Secretary of State for Social Services.

==History==
In 1953, the Ministry of Pensions and the Ministry of National Insurance were merged to create the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. In 1966, the Supplementary Benefits Commission (part of the National Assistance Board) was merged with the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance to form the new Ministry of Social Security, as part of the Ministry of Social Security Act 1966.

In 1968, the Ministry of Social Security and the Ministry of Health were dissolved and their functions merged into a new Department of Health and Social Security by an Order in Council which came into operation on 1 November 1968.

Although the department was titled &#x27;Department of Health and Social Security&#x27;, the title of the cabinet minister with responsibility for the department was &#x27;secretary of state for social services&#x27;.

In 1988 the department was split again into a separate Department of Health and the Department of Social Security.

In 2001 the Department for Work and Pensions was formed from the Department of Social Security, absorbing the employment functions which had previously been the responsibility of the Department for Education and Employment since the dissolution of the Department of Employment in 1995.

== Ministers ==
* Secretary of State for Social Services
* Minister of State for Health
* Minister of State for Social Security

==Impact==
Even two and a half decades after its abolition, the initials &quot;DHSS&quot; continue to be used by the general public to describe the Department for Work and Pensions or some of the benefits it provides (such as Income Support).

==References in popular culture==

* Half Man Half Biscuit the notable cynico-rock group from The Wirral, UK, named their first album &quot;Back in the DHSS&quot; as a pun on the earlier single by the Beatles (&quot;Back in the USSR&quot;) and a nod to the growing unemployment under the Thatcher administration of the 1980s.
* UB40 (a reggae group from Birmingham, whose first album was released in 1980) was named after the form issued by the DHSS to those claiming unemployment benefit, the full name of which was Unemployment Benefit form 40.
* British group Wham! mention the &quot;DHSS&quot; in their song &quot;Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)&quot;.
* Punk poet Attila the Stockbroker&#x27;s poem &quot;Russians in the DHSS&quot; satirized the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union in Thatcher-era Britain.
* In &quot;The Young Ones&quot; episode &quot;Bomb&quot; Rick attempts to write a threatening telegram to the British Government through a DHSS office which he mistakes for the post office.
* In Yes Minister it is mentioned by one of the characters, when sitting in a round-table meeting in relation to equal opportunities for women.

<doc id="402834" wikidata="Q622959" url="?curid=402834" title="Opel Kadett">
<text>The Opel Kadett is a small family car produced by the German automobile manufacturer Opel from 1936 until 1940 and then from 1962 until 1991 (the Cabrio continued until 1993), when it was succeeded by the Opel Astra.

Originally, the Kadett was Opel&#x27;s smallest model; however, as it grew in size with each generation (ultimately competing in the European C-segment), the Opel Corsa became GM/Opel&#x27;s entry-level model.

== Kadett I (1936–1940)==
The first Opel car to carry the Kadett name was presented to the public in December 1936 by Opel&#x27;s commercial-technical director, Heinrich Nordhoff, who would in later decades become known for his leadership role in building up the Volkswagen company. Production was interrupted in 1940 by World War II.

The new Kadett followed the innovative Opel Olympia in adopting a chassis-less unibody construction, suggesting that, like the Vauxhall 10 introduced in 1937 by Opel&#x27;s English , the Opel Kadett was designed for high-volume, low-cost production.

===Kadett serie 11234 (1937)===
For 1937 the Kadett was offered as a small and unpretentious two door &quot;Limousine&quot; (saloon) or, at the same list price of , as a soft top &quot;Cabrio-Limousine&quot;. The body resembled that of the existing larger Opel Olympia and its silhouette reflected the &quot;streamlining&quot; tendencies of the time. The 1,074 cc side-valve engine came from the 1935 Opel P4 and came with the same listed maximum power output of at 3,400 rpm. The wheelbase, at , was right between the little P4 and the larger Olympia. The &quot;11234&quot; nomenclature stands for the engine&#x27;s displacement in deciliters (11) followed by the wheelbase in centimeters (234).

The brakes were now controlled using a hydraulic mechanism. The suspension featured synchronous springing, a suspension configuration already seen on the manufacturer&#x27;s larger models and based on the Dubonnet system for which General Motors in France had purchased the license. The General Motors version, which had been further developed by Opel&#x27;s North American parent, was intended to provide a soft ride, but there was some criticism that handling and road-holding were compromised, especially when the system was applied to small lightweight cars such as the Kadett. By the end of 1937 33,402 of these first-generation Kadetts had been produced.

===Kadett &quot;KJ38&quot; and &quot;K38 Spezial&quot; (1938–1940)===
From December 1937 a modified front grill identified an upgrade. The 1,074 cc Opel engine and the wheelbase were unchanged, with few differences between the cars for 1937 and those for 1938.

The manufacturer now offered two versions of the Kadett, designated the &quot;Kadett KJ38 and the &quot;Kadett K38&quot; the latter also being sold as the &quot;Kadett Spezial&quot;. Mechanically and in terms of published performance there was little to differentiate the two, but the &quot;Spezial&quot; had a chrome stripe below the window line and extra external body trim in other areas such as on the front grill. The interior of the &quot;Spezial&quot; was also better equipped. To the extent that the 300 Mark saving for buyers of the car reflected reduced production costs, the major difference was that the more basic &quot;KJ38&quot; lost the synchromous springing with which the car had been launched, and which continued to be fitted on the &quot;Spezial&quot;. The base car instead reverted to traditional rigid axle based suspension similar to that fitted on the old Opel P4.

The base car was available only as a two-door &quot;Limousine&quot; (saloon). Customers looking for a soft-top &quot;Cabrio-limousine&quot; would need to specify a &quot;Kadett Spezial&quot;. For the first time Kadett buyers, provided they were prepared to choose a &quot;Kadett Spezial&quot; could also specify a four-door &quot;Limousine&quot; (saloon) bodied car, priced at as against for a &quot;Spezial Cabrio-Limousine&quot; and for a two-door &quot;Spezial Limousine&quot;.

The &quot;Kadett KJ38&quot; was intended to fill the market segment of the Opel P4, but the KJ38, priced at , was more expensive than the P4 and its reduced specification left it with the image of a car for poor people (&quot;..Image des Arme-Leute-Autos..&quot;) at a time when economic growth in Germany was finally fostering a less minimalist approach to car buying. The &quot;Kadett K38 Spezial&quot; fared better in the market place: in 1938 and again in 1939 it was Germany&#x27;s top-selling small car. By May 1941 the company had produced 17,871 &quot;Kadett KJ38&quot;s and 56,335 &quot;Kadett K38 Spezial&quot;s.

===Commercial===
Competitive pricing led to commercial success, and Kadetts continued to be produced during the early months of the war: by the time production ended in May 1940, following the intensification of World War II, 106,608 of these Opel Kadetts were produced on the assembly line at Opel&#x27;s Rüsselsheim plant, which had been the first major car plant in Germany to apply the assembly-line techniques pioneered by Henry Ford.

===Soviet afterlife===

After the Second World War, the Soviet Union requested the tooling from the Opel Rüsselsheim car plant in the American occupation zone as part of the war reparations agreed by the victorious powers, to compensate for the loss of the production lines for the domestic KIM-10-52 in the siege of Moscow. Faced with a wide range of German &quot;small litrage&quot; models to choose from, Soviet planners wanted a car that closely followed the general type of the KIM — a 4-door saloon with an all-metal body and 4-stroke engine. They, therefore, rejected both the rear-engined, two-door KdF-Wagen (future VW Beetle) and the two-stroke powered, front-wheel-drive, wooden-bodied DKW F8, built by the Auto Union Chemnitz plant in the Soviet occupation zone. The closest analog of the KIM to be found was the 4-door Kadett K38.

On 26 August 1945, the State Defense Committee published Order No. 9905, which prescribed the start of production of the 4-door Kadett on the Moscow small car plant &quot;without any changes to the design&quot;. The implementation of the plan was far from smooth. The Rüsselsheim plant had been deeply involved in the Nazi war effort, producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe, and consequently has been heavily damaged by the Allied air raids. Very little was left to be salvaged – mostly incoherent drawings and plans, with several stamping dies for the 2-door version of the Kadett to add.

Still, a number of Kadetts had been captured as trophies by the Red Army and were available for study and reverse-engineering. This project was conducted by design bureaus formed as Soviet-German joint ventures under the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD). There were 11 of them in total. One in Berlin reverse-engineered the engine and transmission. Another in Schwarzenberg worked on the steel body. The wooden-bodied estate car was developed in Chemnitz. The vast majority of the personnel of these design bureaus were German specialists and craftsmen hired by the Military Administration. These design bureaus not only prepared the necessary blueprints and documentation, but also provided the wooden master model for the body. They even developed the new trim pieces which distinguished the Moskvitch from its Opel prototype, including hood emblems and hubcaps with a large &quot;M&quot; (for &quot;Moskvitch&quot;). However, the stamping dies and most of the tooling had to be produced in the USSR.

Production started on 4 December 1946. The Moskvitch 400/420 continued to be made in Moscow with some minor changes until 1956, when it was replaced by the Moskvitch 402. The latter was an all-new design apart from the engine, for which Moskvitch continued to use the Kadett side-valve engine until 1958, when it was replaced with a domestically designed OHV engine.

==Kadett A (1962–1965)==

The Kadett was reintroduced in 1962, with deliveries beginning on 2 October, a little more than 22 years after the original model was discontinued in May 1940. The new car (designated the Kadett A) was a small family car like its predecessor, although it was now available in two-door saloon, three-door estate (&quot;Car-A-Van&quot;) and coupé versions.


==Kadett B (1965–1973)==

The Kadett B was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in late summer 1965, The Kadett B was larger all-round than the Kadett A: 5% longer both overall and in terms of the wheelbase, 7% wider and 9% heavier (unladen weight), albeit lower in basic standard &quot;Limousine&quot; (saloon) form. Production ended in July 1973, with the successor model introduced a month later following the summer shutdown, in August. The two-seat Opel GT was heavily based on Kadett B components, its body made by a French contractor, Brissonneau &amp; Lotz, at their Creil factory.


==Kadett C (1973–1979)==

The Kadett C appeared in August 1973 and was Opel&#x27;s version of the General Motors&#x27; &quot;T-Car&quot;. It was the last small Opel to feature rear-wheel drive, and remained in production at Opel&#x27;s Bochum plant until July 1979, by which time Opel had produced 1,701,076. Of these, 52% had been exported outside West Germany, most of them to markets in other parts of western Europe.

The Kadett C was mirrored in Europe by its British derivative — the Vauxhall Chevette. For the first time the Opel Kadett and its Vauxhall equivalent were now very clearly the same car, and marked the gradual convergence of Opel and Vauxhall models, which would be completed with the later Kadett D.


==Kadett D (1979–1984)==

The Kadett D was introduced in the middle of August 1979, with deliveries on the home market beginning early in September 1979. In November 1979, the car went on sale in the United Kingdom, some five months before the Vauxhall Astra Mark 1, the British version, was launched in March 1980. The cars were designed as three- or five-door hatchbacks and estates or estates. There were also two- and four-door saloons featuring separate boots/trunks, which shared the silhouettes of the hatchbacks: in the United Kingdom, the saloon versions were soon withdrawn, until the 1986 launch of the MKII-based Belmont. For the first time since 1965, there was no coupé-bodied Kadett in the range: the previous Kadett C coupé was indirectly replaced by the three-door 1.3 SR sports model.

Technologically, the Kadett D was part of a major investment for Opel (and General Motors as a whole) in a new front-wheel drive architecture, with an all-new family of engines and transmissions which would later be applied in the larger Ascona C and the smaller Corsa A in 1981, and 1982, respectively. It was also the first application of the Family I engine, with a single overhead camshaft, aluminium-alloy cylinder head, hydraulic valve lifters, with capacities of 1297 cc (producing 60 PS and 75 PS) and had a transaxle design that allowed the clutch to be replaced without removing the transmission unit. A carry-over 1196 cc Opel OHV engine from previous generations of the Kadett producing and a top speed of was also offered on entry-level models from launch. The larger Family II engine debuted in 1600 cc form and was offered after Frankfurt 1981, followed by an 1800 cc version introduced for the Kadett GSE/Astra GTE model. The Kadett D was also equipped with a 1600 cc diesel engine, an option which was first presented at the Brussels Motor Show in 1982. Another frugal model, mostly sold in Italy, was the 1.0 liter model with .

This range of engines was also used for later models of the Corsa/Nova, and the mid-sized Cavalier/Ascona. From May 1981, the 1.3 was also available with a three-speed automatic. The automatic was made available to the diesel in September 1982. In the United Kingdom, Opels and Vauxhalls were initially sold through separate marketing operations, with overlapping lineups that competed directly with each other. By 1982 this anomaly had been sorted out and the Opel lineup was limited to the well-equipped five-door Berlina (1.3S or 1.6S) and the sporty 1.6 SR, leaving most of the market to the Vauxhall-badged cars.

One interesting version which first appeared in mid-1982 was the Kadett Pirsch, (for deer stalking, a stealthy form of hunting). In non-German-speaking countries it was generally marketed as the &quot;Kadett Off Road.&quot; This was an estate car with rustic trim, fitted with a limited-slip differential, reinforced suspension and more suitable tires, increased ground clearance, a skid plate, and shortened front fenders. In Sweden, a special postal Kadett (&quot;Opel Kadett Post&quot;) was offered, fitted with a high roof (necessitating a unique and much taller windshield) and a sliding right-hand door, RHD, and the automatic transmission. This version was converted by Karosseriefabrik Voll in Würzburg, Germany. Voll also made a postal version of the later Kadett E.

The Kadett D was also sold as the IDA Kadett and assembled Kikinda, Yugoslavia. In Indonesia, PT. Garmak Motor was also reproduced Kadett D after 1984 in Jakarta, only for local market general buyers and taxi fleets until around 1995. It was later replaced by Opel Optima (Astra F) saloon. Only available as a 5-door hatchback, with carburetted 1298 cc GM Family 1 engine and 5-speed manual transmission.

=== Models ===

===South Africa===
The Opel Kadett D was also built in South Africa by General Motors South African (Pty) Ltd. The South African range was made up of four-door fastback saloons, five-door hatchbacks, and a five-door estate model called the Voyage. The engines used are Opel&#x27;s 1.2-litre overhead valve inline-four (L models only), or the OHC 1.3-litre (GL, GLS, and Voyage). Power is and respectively. Later a 1.6 L was added and also a 1.8 L in the GTE performance model.

Small engine sizes with round lights on the nose while large engine sizes would have square lights on the nose. 
==Kadett E (1984–1995)==

The Kadett E (sold as the Vauxhall Astra Mark 2 in the United Kingdom) was introduced in August 1984, and was voted the 1985 European Car of the Year. The 1984 model was also developed into a more conventional three-box design with a boot (trunk), badged as the Vauxhall Belmont in the United Kingdom, launched at Frankfurt 1985. There was an estate car called the &quot;Caravan&quot; in mainland Europe, available with either three or five doors, as well as a convertible built by Bertone in Italy (from 1987). There was also a van version with a raised roof, called the Opel Kadett Combo in Europe, and the Bedford Astramax in the United Kingdom.

The car was noted for its advanced aerodynamics and distinctive &quot;teardrop&quot; shape — mirroring the trend in the mid 1980s for swooping aerodynamic styling — with the front end styling taken directly from the Opel Tech 1 concept car of 1981, although some styling cues from the Kadett D were retained for continuity such as its &#x27;Kamm tail&#x27; and oversized C-pillar extraction vent. This generation was built and sold as the Chevrolet Kadett in Brazil, while the estate car was called the Chevrolet Ipanema. The Kadett E formed the basis of the Daewoo LeMans (later known as the Daewoo Cielo, Racer and Nexia) in South Korea, Nexia being the hatchback version), which was sold in the United States and New Zealand as the Pontiac LeMans, and in Canada (initially) as the Passport Optima. The Nexia was produced until 2016 at the UzDaewoo plant in Asaka, Uzbekistan.


==Name change to Astra==
In 1991, GM Europe decided to standardise model names across its two brands, and Opel adopted Vauxhall&#x27;s name for the Kadett, Astra, for the replacement car for Europe which debuted that year. Only South Africa kept the Kadett name until the 1999 (Astra/Kadett F), whereafter all models took the Astra name.

However, under Opel&#x27;s internal naming convention, successive generations of the Astra platform are treated as a logical continuation of the Kadett lineage, hence the original 1991 Astra was designated &quot;Astra F&quot; in relation to the previous Kadett E. This convention has continued through the current Astra L.

<text>Dunsmore is a hamlet in the parish of Ellesborough, in Buckinghamshire, England. It occupies a hilltop position in the Chiltern Hills about 2 miles south of Wendover. Access is by two steep, single-track hillside lanes.

The place name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means literally &quot;Dunna&#x27;s moor&quot;.

Much of the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust and is heavily wooded with beech trees, and bracken. Due to its elevation the village is occasionally cut off by treacherous road conditions during harsh winters.

Central features of the hamlet are the village pond, the village hall and the Church of the Resurrection, Dunsmore. In the past the village supported a shop and two public houses, The Fox and The Black Horse, but these have now closed and been converted into residential dwellings.

Dunsmore is close by to Chequers, the country retreat for the serving Prime Minister, and the local Second Boer War memorial on Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire. The memorial stands above Wendover in the Aylesbury Vale. There are many good, rural walks nearby.

<text>Dunton is a village and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England. The village is situated approximately north from Aylesbury and south-east from Winslow.

In 2011, Dunton had a population (including Hoggeston) of 189. The parish contains the Grade II* listed Church of St Martin and six other buildings that are Grade II listed.

==History==
According to &quot;A Dictionary of British Place Names&quot;, the Dunton name is Old English in origin, and means an estate linked to a man called &#x27;Dodda&#x27; or &#x27;Dudda&#x27;. In the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; Dunton it is recorded as &quot;Dodintone.&quot; At that time, the manor was held by Odo of Bayeux, a bishop. Records from 1298 and 1322 discuss a windmill in Dunton. 

In the 1870s, John Marius Wilson described Dunton as: &quot;a parish in Winslow district, Bucks; near the source of the river Thame, 4 miles SE by S of Winslow town and r. station.&quot;

For many years before 1862, the manor was held by the Earl Spencer, but then passed to Lord Carrington. As of 1925, his son, the Marquess of Lincolnshire, held the manor.

Dunton&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to St Martin. The historic listing summary provides these specifics: &quot;C12 nave with S. wall rebuilt late C18, C13 chancel. Cl5 W. tower, all much restored late C18&quot;. Documents from the reign of Edward I of England indicate that the church was an &quot;appurtenant to Dunton Manor&quot;, and had a rectory.

Another source states that the church nave dates to the 12th century, the chancel to the 13th, and the tower to the 15th. Rebuilding and restoration took place in the 18th century. St Martin&#x27;s was Grade II* listed by English Heritage in 1959. The church is the only public building in Dunton, and is a centre for parish social life. Further parish Grade II listed buildings include The Old Rectory, an early 18th-century house; and Dunton Manor, a 16th-century house with later alterations.

==Demographics==
Dunton&#x27;s population in 2011 was 189 according to census data. Historically the parish population has not been this large. Past parish data shows population has only surpassed 100 people twice before 2001: once in 1831, when there were 116 people; and ten years later in 1841, when there were 107.

The numbers of males and females follow a general trend between 1801 and 2011. The only year in which males and females were of equal number was 1961, when each numbered 38.

<text>The Isle of Wight Festival is a British music festival which takes place annually in Newport on the Isle of Wight, England. It was originally a counterculture event held from 1968 to 1970.

The 1970 event was by far the largest of these early festivals and the unexpectedly high attendance levels led, in 1971, to Parliament adding a section to the Isle of Wight County Council Act 1971 preventing overnight open-air gatherings of more than 5,000 people on the island without a special licence from the council. The event was revived in 2002 with Rock Island 2002, and has since been held annually, except for 2020 when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

==Original festival==
The original events were promoted and organised by the Foulk brothers (Ron and Ray Foulk) under the banner of their company Fiery Creations Limited and their younger brother Bill Foulk. The venues were Ford Farm (near Godshill), Wootton and Afton Down (near Freshwater) respectively. The 1969 event featured Bob Dylan and the Band. This was Dylan&#x27;s first paid performance since his motor cycle accident some three years earlier, and was held at a time when many still wondered if he would ever perform again. Followers from across the world trekked to the Isle of Wight for the performance. Estimates of 150,000–250,000 attended. The 1969 festival opened on Friday 29 August—eleven days after the close of Woodstock. Dylan was living in Woodstock, New York, at the time and it was widely believed that he would perform there, after the event had been &quot;put in his own backyard&quot;. As it happened, Dylan left for the Isle of Wight on 15 August—the day the Woodstock festival began.

The 1970 event was by far the largest of these early festivals; indeed it was said at the time to be one of the largest human gatherings in the world, with estimates of over 600,000, surpassing the attendance at Woodstock. Included in the line-up of over fifty performers were Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, The Doors, The Who, Lighthouse, Ten Years After, Terry Reid, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Joni Mitchell, The Moody Blues, Melanie, Donovan, Gilberto Gil, Free, Chicago, Richie Havens, John Sebastian, Leonard Cohen, Jethro Tull, Taste (Irish band) and Tiny Tim. The unexpectedly high attendance levels led, in 1971, to Parliament adding a section to the Isle of Wight County Council Act 1971 preventing overnight open-air gatherings of more than 5,000 people on the island without a special licence from the council.

The 1970 festival was filmed by a film crew under director Murray Lerner, who at that point had just directed the Academy Award-nominated documentary &quot;Festival&quot; of the Newport Folk Festival. The footage passed to Lerner in settlement of legal fees after a dispute with the Foulk brothers in which each side claimed against the other for breach of contract. Lerner distilled material from the festival into the film &quot;Message to Love&quot; (released on video in the US as &quot;Message to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival: The Movie&quot;) released theatrically in 1996 and subsequently on DVD. In addition to this film, Lerner has created full-length films focused on performances by individual artists at the 1970 festival. To date there have been individual films of Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, The Moody Blues, Free, Taste (Irish band), Leonard Cohen, Jethro Tull, The Doors and Joni Mitchell.
Dave Roe (ex Liverpool Collegiate) produced all the psychedelic artwork for posters and advertising material.

===1968===
The first festival was held at Hells Field, Ford farm, near Godshill, on 31 August and 1 September 1968, and was attended by about 10,000 people. Jefferson Airplane headlined, with Arthur Brown, The Move, Smile, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation, Plastic Penny, Fairport Convention, and The Pretty Things also performing.

===1969===

This took place on 29 to 31 August 1969 at Wootton Creek, with an estimated attendance of 150,000. The line-up included Bob Dylan, The Band, The Nice, The Pretty Things, Marsha Hunt, The Who, Third Ear Band, Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Fat Mattress, Joe Cocker. Many celebrities of the day also attended the Festival, including John Lennon and Yoko Ono, George Harrison with Pattie Boyd, Ringo Starr with Maureen Starkey, Keith Richards and Jane Fonda.

===1970===

This event was held between 26 and 30 August 1970 at Afton Down. Attendance has been estimated by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; to have been 600,000 or even 700,000. However promoter Ray Foulk has said he believes it to have been half of that. It was widely reported on, due to its line-up and extremely high attendance. Acts included Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, Jethro Tull, Ten Years After, Chicago, The Doors, Lighthouse, The Who (whose set produced a live album), Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Supertramp, The Moody Blues, Joan Baez, Free, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Kris Kristofferson, Donovan, Ralph McTell, John Sebastian, Terry Reid, Taste (Irish band), Redbone and Shawn Phillips.

==Revived festival details==
The event was revived in 2002 at Seaclose Park, a recreation ground on the outskirts of Newport. It has been held annually since that year, progressively extending itself northwards beyond Seaclose Park along the fields of the eastern Medina valley. Many artists have performed since its revival including The Rolling Stones, Blondie, Amy Winehouse, Robbie Williams, Paolo Nutini, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, The Prodigy, Green Day, Paul McCartney, Fleetwood Mac, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Muse, Boy George, Sex Pistols, Rod Stewart, Calvin Harris, Stereophonics, Yungblud, Pulp, Faithless, Donovan, Ray Davies, Robert Plant, Queen + Adam Lambert, David Bowie, Liam Gallagher, Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Manic Street Preacher, The Who, The High Kings, Placebo, R.E.M., Travis, Coldplay, The Zombies, Pearl Jam, The Proclaimers, Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams, The Police, Foo Fighters, The Killers, Nile Rodgers and Chic, The Stone Roses, Madness, Lewis Capaldi, Paloma Faith, James Marriott, Kings of Leon and Rick Astley. Bowie&#x27;s 13 June 2004 concert would prove to be his last live performance in the UK following emergency angioplasty in Hamburg after a concert in Germany twelve days later which eventually saw him retire from touring. It was sponsored by Nokia from 2004 to 2006. The promoters of the event now are Solo Promoters Ltd.

<text>Charissa Saverio (born 7 December 1968), and better known as DJ Rap, is a British drum and bass, house and progressive electronic music producer and DJ.

While the majority of her work is in the jungle style, her more successful work is in traditional electronic music. DJ Rap owns, records for, runs and A&amp;Rs two record labels Propa Talent and Impropa Talent. She is also a producer, model and actress.

==Biography==
DJ Rap was born in Singapore, daughter of an Italian father and an Irish-Malaysian mother. She is the daughter of actress Elaine Edley . The family moved to Southampton, England, when Saverio was a teenager. She later lived in Walthamstow, East London before she became a DJ.

She has worked as an engineer, often collaborating with other artists. After being the first artist on the scene to self-release her first CD, she signed to Sony along with Grooverider and Leftfield.

Her artist album, &quot;Learning Curve&quot;, was released in 1999 to critical acclaim, and resulted in several stylized music videos, including two versions of &quot;Good to Be Alive&quot; (one for the CD version and another for the radio remix) and &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, a song about having to be a strong woman to survive. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Learning Curve&quot; three and a half stars, stating &quot;this is the record Madonna wanted to make&quot;.

She also released compilation albums &quot;Journeys by DJ&quot;, &quot;Propa Classics Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;Armani Exchange CHEMISTRY&quot; and &quot;Touching Bass&quot;, &quot;Bulletproof&quot;, and &quot;Up All Night&quot;.

DJ Rap has also done vocals for several artists, including BT (for &quot;Giving Up the Ghost&quot;) and Art of Trance (for &quot;Madagascar [Domi Nation Remix]&quot;).

In 2014, she played &quot;Hologram Girl&quot; in &quot;The Principle&quot;, a documentary examining the Copernican Principle.

<doc id="402845" wikidata="Q91451" url="?curid=402845" title="Wire obstacle">
<text>In the military science of fortification, wire obstacles are defensive obstacles made from barbed wire, barbed tape or concertina wire. They are designed to disrupt, delay and generally slow down an attacking enemy. During the time that the attackers are slowed by the wire obstacle (or possibly deliberately channelled into killing zones, or both) they are easy to target with machine gun and artillery fire. Depending on the requirements and available resources, wire obstacles may range from a simple barbed wire fence in front of a defensive position, to elaborate patterns of fences, concertinas, &quot;dragon&#x27;s teeth&quot; (which serve a similar purpose as wire obstacles, but for combat vehicles instead) and minefields (both anti-personnel and anti-armor) hundreds of metres thick.

One example is &quot;low wire entanglement&quot;, which consists of irregularly placed stakes that have been driven into the ground with only some 15 cm (six inches) showing. The barbed wire is then wrapped and tightened on to these. An enemy combatant running through the barrier, which is difficult to see, is apt to trip and get caught.

== History ==
Wire obstacles were used by Union Army general Ambrose Burnside during the Battle of Fort Sanders in the Knoxville campaign of the American Civil War, when telegraph wire was strung between tree stumps 30 to 80 yards in front of one part of the Union line. The Royal Danish Army also used wire fences in front of its Danevirke fortifications during the Second Schleswig War. They first saw significant military use by British forces during the Second Boer War, and reached the pinnacle of visibility during World War I where they indirectly, together with machine guns, were responsible for many (although not the majority of) casualties in the trench warfare that dominated that conflict. Wire obstacles served to magnify the substantial advantage that the repeating rifle and rapid-firing artillery, along with machine guns, had given to the defending side in the new era of warfare.

World War I entanglements could in some places be tens of metres thick and several metres deep, with the entire space filled with a random, tangled mass of barbed wire. Entanglements were often not created deliberately, but by pushing together the mess of wire formed when conventional barbed wire fences had been damaged by artillery shells. Whenever there was time and opportunity to plan and emplace wire obstacles during World War I, it was standard practice to deploy designs that would channel and concentrate attacking troops, through avenues of approach, herding them like cattle into designated killing zones i.e. fixing multiple screw pickets of wire running diagonally, away from the protected zone. This meant that a belt-fed machine-gun such as the Maschinengewehr 08 sited along that diagonal line had easy targets to enfilade when attacking troops were blocked from advancing by the wire and then massed together in a line.

Another method was to deliberately leave attractive-looking gaps in wire obstacles to give the appearance of a weak link in the defences. Such gaps were designed to act like a funnel, luring attacking troops through the opening and straight into the concentrated direct and enfilade fire of different machine gun emplacements. Because multiple water-cooled machine-guns such as the Vickers gun were used, continuous fire could be sustained for hours at a time if required. Methods for soldiers to face this threat were a small wheeled steel plate that was slowly pushed forward in front of the soldier to shield them from bullet fire as they crawled, shielded machine gun carts, the MacAdam Shield Shovel or systems like the mobile personnel shield among others. When the obstacle was reached, access holes in the shield allowed the attacking soldier to cut away at the wire obstacle with pliers from behind the protection of the armored shield.

Stormtrooper platoons included ballistic shields in their equipment list, as infiltration was one of their specialities. Relatively elaborate obstacles were also used in some phases of the Korean War, and continue to be used on the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and a few other borders. However the more fluid nature of modern war means that most obstacles used today are relatively simple, temporary barriers. Tanks and light armored vehicles can generally flatten unmined wire obstacles, although the wire can become entangled in the tracks and immobilize the vehicle. This can also occur to wheeled vehicles once the wire becomes wrapped around the axle. Wire obstacles can also be breached by intense artillery shelling or Bangalore torpedoes.

==Enhanced effectiveness==
The effectiveness of any wire obstacle is greatly increased by planting anti-tank and blast antipersonnel mines in and around it. Additionally, connecting bounding anti-personnel mines (e.g. the PROM-1) to the obstacle with tripwires has the effect of booby-trapping the obstacle itself, hindering attempts to clear it. Dummy tripwires can be added to cause further confusion. If anti-personnel mines are unavailable, it is very easy to connect hand-grenades to the wire using trip-wires. If the use of lethal explosive devices is deemed to be unsuitable, it is easy to emplace tripflares in and around the wire obstacle in order to make night-time infiltration harder.

<doc id="402848" wikidata="Q2604936" url="?curid=402848" title="Murli Manohar Joshi">
<text>Murli Manohar Joshi (born 5 January 1934) is an Indian politician. He is one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of which he was the President between 1991 and 1993. Joshi is the former Member of Parliament from Kanpur Lok Sabha constituency. He is a former professor of physics in University of Allahabad. He is one of the senior most leaders of the BJP and one of the founding members. Joshi later became the Union Human Resources &amp; Development Minister in the National Democratic Alliance government. Joshi was awarded Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award, in 2017 by the Government of India. Joshi has been a member of RSS since his college days.

== Background and personal life ==
Joshi was born in Delhi on 5 January 1934. His family hails from Almora in Kumaon region, which is now part of the Uttarakhand state. His father&#x27;s name was Manmohan Joshi. In 1966, Joshi was married to Tarla Joshi, a lady of his own community and similar family background, in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian way. The lifelong marriage has proven entirely harmonious and conventional. The couple are the parents of two daughters, Nivedita and Priyamvada.

==Education==
Joshi had his early education in Chandpur, district Bijnor and in Almora, from where his family hails. He completed his B.Sc. from Meerut College and M.Sc. from Allahabad University. In Allahabad, one of his teachers was Professor Rajendra Singh, who later became the Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

Joshi did his doctorate in physics at Allahabad University. The subject of his doctoral thesis was spectroscopy. He published a research paper in Physics in Hindi, which was a first of its kind. After completing his PhD, Joshi started teaching physics at Allahabad University.

== Politics and activism ==
Joshi came in contact with the RSS in Delhi at a young age and took part in the Cow Protection Movement in 1953–54, in the Kumbh Kisan Andolan of UP in 1955, demanding halving of land revenue assessment. During the Emergency period (1975–1977) in India, Joshi was in jail from 26 June 1975 until the Lok Sabha elections in 1977. He was elected Member of Parliament from Almora. When the Janata Party (which then included his party) came to power forming the first non-Congress government in Indian history, Joshi was elected General Secretary of the Janata Parliamentary Party. After the fall of the government, his party came out of Janata Party in 1980, and formed the Bharatiya Janata Party or the BJP. Joshi first looked after the Central Office as a General Secretary and later became Party Treasurer. As General Secretary of BJP, he was directly in charge of Bihar, Bengal and North-Eastern States. Later, when BJP formed a government in India under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Joshi served as the Human Resource Development Minister in the cabinet.

In December 1991, Joshi held a &quot;yatra&quot;, the &quot;Ekta&quot; &quot;Yatra&quot;, intended to signal that BJP supported national unity and opposed separatist movements. It began on 11 December in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu and visited 14 states. The rally&#x27;s final stop to hoist the Indian flag in Jammu and Kashmir on 26 January 1992 was considered unsuccessful, with minimal local participation.

Joshi is known to have been influenced by the life and work of Babasaheb Ambedkar, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Deendayal Upadhyaya. Joshi was a three-term M.P. from Allahabad before he was defeated in the Lok Sabha elections of May 2004. He won election to the 15th Lok Sabha from Varanasi as a BJP candidate.
He also served as the home minister for 13 days government in 1996.
Joshi was appointed as Chairman of the Manifesto Preparation Board of the BJP in 2009. He was honoured as &quot;Proud Past Alumni&quot; of Allahabad University by Allahabad University Alumni Association.

He was a sitting MP from Varanasi and he vacated that seat for Narendra Modi in 2014 Lok Sabha Elections. He later contested from Kanpur and won from the constituency by a margin of 2.23 lac votes.

<text>Interface bloat is a phenomenon in software design where an interface incorporates too many (often unnecessary) operations or elements, causing issues such as difficulty navigating and usability.
== Definition ==
While the term bloat can refer to a variety of terms in software design, Interface bloat refers to the phenomenon where the user interface (UI) becomes unnecessarily complex and overloaded with features, options, or elements that can overwhelm users. This often leads to a cluttered experience, decreased usability, and increased difficulty for users to accomplish their tasks efficiently. Interface bloat can arise from various sources, including the addition of excessive functionality without proper consideration of user needs, the merging of disparate features, or pressure to include numerous options to cater to a broader audience.

<text>Kajol Devgan (née Mukherjee) (; born 5 August 1974), known mononymously as Kajol, is an Indian actress. Described in the media as one of the most successful actresses of Hindi cinema, she is the recipient of numerous accolades, such as six Filmfare Awards, which include a record-tying five Best Actress wins. In 2011, she was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India.

The daughter of Tanuja and Shomu Mukherjee, Kajol made her acting debut with &quot;Bekhudi&quot; (1992) while still in school. She subsequently quit her studies, and had commercial successes in &quot;Baazigar&quot; (1993), and &quot;Yeh Dillagi&quot; (1994). Starring roles in the top-grossing romances &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995) and &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998) established her as a leading star in the 1990s and earned her two Filmfare Awards for Best Actress. She also gained critical appreciation for playing a psychopathic killer in &quot;&quot; (1997) and an avenger in &quot;Dushman&quot; (1998).

After starring in the family drama &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001), which won her a third Filmfare Award, Kajol took a sabbatical from full-time acting and worked infrequently over the next decades. She won two more Best Actress awards at Filmfare for starring in the romantic thriller &quot;Fanaa&quot; (2006) and the drama &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; (2010). Her highest-grossing releases came with the comedy &quot;Dilwale&quot; (2015) and the period film &quot;Tanhaji&quot; (2020). She has since starred in the streaming projects &quot;Tribhanga&quot; (2021), &quot;The Trial&quot; (2023) and &quot;Do Patti&quot; (2024).

In addition to acting in films, Kajol is a social activist and noted for her work with widows and children. She has featured as a talent judge for the reality show &quot;Rock-N-Roll Family&quot; in 2008, and holds a managerial position at Devgn Entertainment and Software Ltd. Kajol has been married to the actor and filmmaker Ajay Devgn since 1999, with whom she has two children.

== Early life and background ==
Kajol was born in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) on 5 August 1974. Her mother, Tanuja, is an actress, while her father Shomu Mukherjee was a film director and producer. Her younger sister, Tanishaa, is also an actress. Her maternal aunt was actress Nutan and her maternal grandmother, Shobhna Samarth, and great-grandmother, Rattan Bai, were both involved in Hindi cinema. Her paternal uncles, Joy Mukherjee and Deb Mukherjee, were film actors, while her paternal and maternal grandfathers, Sashadhar Mukherjee and Kumarsen Samarth, respectively, were filmmakers. Kajol&#x27;s cousins Rani Mukerji, Sharbani Mukherjee, and Mohnish Bahl are also actors; whereas Ayan Mukerji is a director.

Kajol describes herself as being mischievous, stubborn, and impulsive at a young age. Her parents separated when she was young, but Kajol was unaffected by it since the matter was never discussed at home. Kajol was looked after by her maternal grandmother, who &quot;never let me feel that my mother was away and working&quot;. According to Kajol, her mother inculcated a sense of independence in her since she was young. Growing up between two separate cultures, she inherited her &quot;Maharashtrian pragmatism&quot; from her mother and her &quot;Bengali temperament&quot; from her father. As part of tradition, along with the Mukherjee family, Kajol, a practising Hindu, celebrates the Durga Puja festival in the suburban neighbourhood of Santacruz annually.

Kajol was educated at St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent School, Panchgani. Apart from her studies, she participated in extra-curricular activities, such as dancing. It was in school that she began to form an active interest in reading fiction, as it helped her &quot;through the bad moments&quot; in her life. In the early 1990s, Tanuja tried to direct a film to launch her as an actress, but it was shelved after a few days of shooting. At sixteen, Kajol began work on &quot;Bekhudi&quot;, which according to her was a &quot;big dose of luck&quot;; she was cast by him when she visited the studio of the photographer Gautam Rajadhyaksha, who also wrote the film&#x27;s screenplay. She intended to return to school after shooting during her two-months summer vacation but eventually dropped out to pursue a full-time career in film—though she later regretted the decision.

== Film career ==
=== Early work (1992–1994) ===
Kajol made her acting debut at age seventeen in the 1992 romantic drama &quot;Bekhudi&quot; alongside another debutant, Kamal Sadanah, and her mother Tanuja. Kajol played Radhika, who falls in love with Sadanah&#x27;s character against her parents&#x27; disapproval. The film turned out to be a box office flop, but Kajol&#x27;s performance gained positive notice. The following year, she was cast in Abbas–Mustan&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Baazigar&quot; (1993), the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year with revenues of . Co-starring Shah Rukh Khan and Shilpa Shetty, the film saw Kajol in the role of Priya Chopra, a young woman who falls in love with her sister&#x27;s murderer, unaware of his identity. Kajol&#x27;s performance in the film drew critical attention.

In 1994, Kajol appeared in &quot;Udhaar Ki Zindagi&quot; as an orphaned girl who visits her estranged grandparents (Jeetendra and Moushumi Chatterjee). It failed to do well at the box office, however, Kajol was named the Best Actress (Hindi) by the Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association. The film was an emotionally draining experience for Kajol, and she later maintained that it had affected her so deeply that after shooting ended, she was on the verge of a crisis. Consequently, she made a deliberate decision to sign up lighter films in which she would have roles of minimal importance and no intense dramatic efforts, including &quot;Hulchul&quot;, &quot;Gundaraj&quot;, and &quot;Karan Arjun&quot;—all released a year later.

She gained wider public recognition for her role in &quot;Yeh Dillagi&quot;, a romance produced by Yash Raj Films and based on the 1953 American play &quot;Sabrina Fair&quot;. She starred as Sapna, a chauffeur&#x27;s daughter who becomes a model and catches the interest of the two sons of her father&#x27;s employers (Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan). A financial success, &quot;Yeh Dillagi&quot; proved to be a breakthrough for Kajol, earning her a first Best Actress nomination at the annual Filmfare Awards. &quot;The Indian Express&quot; took note of her believable performance, and &quot;Screen&quot; concluded that &quot;Yeh Dillagi&quot; had changed her screen persona from a girl next door to a beauty extraordinaire.

=== Established actress (1995–1998) ===
In 1995, Kajol had two major commercial successes: &quot;Karan Arjun&quot; and &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;. The former is an action film by Rakesh Roshan, based on the concept of reincarnation, and it offered her the small part of Sonia Saxena Singh. She explained her minor role in the film, saying that she wanted to be in an ornamental role and admitting she had nothing to do in the film except be glamorous. The film emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. Kajol&#x27;s next releases—&quot;Taaqat&quot;, &quot;Hulchul&quot; and &quot;Gundaraj&quot;—underperformed at the box office; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, Ajay Devgn, and trade analysts linked the failure to their chemistry.

In &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;, Kajol&#x27;s final 1995 release, she and Shah Rukh Khan starred as non-resident Indians from London who fall in love during a trip across Europe and reunite in India to persuade her conservative father to call off her upcoming arranged marriage. Kajol spoke of her attachment to the project and her full emotional involvement with her character, Simran. One of the most successful films of all-time in India, it has been continuously running in Mumbai and, having surpassed 1000 weeks of screening in 2014, became the longest-running Indian film ever. Equally popular with critics, the film earned ten Filmfare Awards, including a first Best Actress for Kajol. It has been voted one of the best films ever made in polls by the British Film Institute. Raja Sen from Rediff.com thought Kajol was well-cast as Simran, arguing that &quot;the real-as-life actress bringing warmth and credulity to the initially prudish and reluctant Simran&quot;. 1996 saw her in the poorly received action film &quot;Bambai Ka Babu&quot;.

In 1997, Kajol&#x27;s portrayal of Isha Diwan, an obsessive lover turned psychopathic serial killer, in &quot;&quot;, was labelled by critics a turning point. The director Rajiv Rai said that he &quot;tapped the versatile artistry in Kajol&quot;, commending her for the finesse she brought to the part. The suspense thriller, also starring Bobby Deol and Manisha Koirala, was a mainstream success. &quot;India Today&quot; noted Kajol for outpacing her co-stars, and &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote in 2016 that she was &quot;probably the first to have broken her image&quot;. In 2002, Rediff.com included her performance in its listing of best villain performances. Kajol eventually became the first female actor to be nominated for and win the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role. In later years, Kajol said she accepted the part to avoid typecasting and expressed her desire to play more roles of the type.

Following a leading role in the reincarnation-based film &quot;Hameshaa&quot;, Kajol replaced Madhuri Dixit to play the lead opposite Prabhu Deva and Arvind Swamy in Rajiv Menon&#x27;s Tamil-language romantic musical &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot;. Kajol found dancing alongside Deva (himself a dance choreographer) difficult and it took her dozens of retakes and rehearsals to get the steps right. She played Priya Amalraj, a convent student who aspires to become a nun, and her voice was dubbed by actress Revathi. &quot;The Indian Express&quot; reviewed: &quot;Kajol is full of beans and fits into her character with commendable ease. Hers is perhaps one of the most expressive faces of the present&quot;. While the original version was embraced by audiences, the Hindi-dubbed version of the film (titled &quot;Sapnay&quot;) failed commercially. Her next release was Indra Kumar&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Ishq&quot;, alongside Aamir Khan, Juhi Chawla and Ajay Devgn. A commercial success, the film won critical praise for the performances of the four leads.
In 1998, Kajol reinforced her status as a leading actress of Hindi cinema by featuring in the three highest-grossing productions of the year: &quot;Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot;, &quot;Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha&quot; and &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;; all of which were nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Film, with the lattermost winning it. &quot;Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot;, where she played a naïve village girl, released first and won her positive feedback. She next played twin sisters, Sonia and Naina, in &quot;Dushman&quot;. Revolving around Naina&#x27;s quest to avenge the murder of Sonia, the film saw Kajol in one of her best-reviewed performances. Having initially refused the offer due to her lack of comfort shooting the rape scene, she finally accepted it on the condition that a body-double be used in it. The film won her the Screen Award for Best Actress. Suparn Verma noted her for being in &quot;superb form&quot; in both roles.

Anees Bazmee&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha&quot;, a remake of the 1995 American film &quot;French Kiss&quot;, followed. She played the comic role of Sanjana, a clumsy woman who travels from Paris to India in search of her philandering fiancé, but falls for another man (Ajay Devgn). The film became a hit and fetched Kajol another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare that year. Deepa Deosthalee from &quot;The Indian Express&quot; called &quot;Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha&quot; &quot;Kajol&#x27;s film all the way&quot; and commended her presence that made the film to be worth-watching; Khalid Mohamed referred to her as &quot;the show&#x27;s super-saving grace. Bubbly and spontaneous as ever, hers is a perfectly balanced performance, rescuing even the loudest scenes from going over the top.&quot;

The biggest success of 1998 for Kajol was her final release of that year, Karan Johar&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;. The first Indian feature to be shot in Scotland, it emerged as an all-time blockbuster in both India and overseas. Kajol played Anjali Sharma, a tomboyish college student who is secretly in love with her best friend from college (Shah Rukh Khan). The story follows their renewed encounter years later when he is widowed and she has transformed her appearance and is already engaged to marry someone else. Critics considered Kajol&#x27;s performance bold and convincing, despite an otherwise unrealistic plot. Nikhat Kazmi wrote that she is &quot;almost mesmeric&quot; in the part. She won her second Best Actress award at the 44th Filmfare Awards and first Zee Cine Award for Best Actor – Female for her work. &quot;Filmfare&quot; included Kajol&#x27;s performances in both &quot;Dushman&quot; and &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; in its listing of Indian cinema&#x27;s &quot;80 Most Iconic performances&quot;. In a year-end column, &quot;The Tribune&quot; Madhur Mittal reported that Kajol had &quot;emerged as the consummate heroine with her excellent emoting and sensational screen presence in each portrayal&quot;.

=== Decrease in workload (1999–2001) ===
Journalists speculated that the supporting role of the other woman of Ajay Devgn&#x27;s character in &quot;Dil Kya Kare&quot;, Kajol&#x27;s first release after marriage, would be &quot;the acid test&quot; for her. She explained that she accepted the role solely &quot;because it had shades of grey&quot;. The film met with largely negative reviews, though &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; noted her for playing the role with finesse. Commercially too, the film failed to do well. The drama &quot;Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain&quot;, on the other hand, performed well with critics and audiences. Co-starring Anil Kapoor, it gave her experience with &quot;the stereotypical, sacrificing woman role&quot; and earned her another Best Actress Filmfare nomination. The film generated media coverage for being one of the few woman-centered films to attract viewers in Indian cinemas. Her final release of the year was &quot;Hote Hote Pyar Ho Gaya&quot;. The &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; noted her chemistry with Jackie Shroff but wrote off the film.

The following year, Kajol and her husband starred together in his home-production &quot;Raju Chacha&quot;, whose plot revolves on the love story between a conman and a governess of three children belonging to a wealthy family. The children&#x27;s film, with a production cost of , was declared as among the most expensive Hindi films at the time. Dinesh Raheja wrote of the lack of imagination in the script, which affected the chemistry between Kajol and Ajay Devgn. In Rahul Rawail&#x27;s &quot;Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi&quot; (2001) Kajol played twin sisters who are separated at birth. The film was poorly reviewed as was Kajol&#x27;s dual role, dismissed as &quot;a double bore&quot;. Roshmila Bhattacharya from &quot;Screen&quot; defended Kajol&#x27;s presence and her energetic performance. Both &quot;Raju Chacha&quot; and &quot;Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi&quot; were flops at the box office.

Later that year, Kajol played a leading role in Karan Johar&#x27;s ensemble drama &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, which was the top-grossing Indian production of all-time in the overseas market. She played Anjali Sharma, a young Punjabi woman from the Chandni Chowk area who falls for a wealthy man. She identified herself with the character&#x27;s noisy nature and found similarities between it and that of Hema Malini in &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975). The role required Kajol to speak in Punjabi, a language she was not fluent in, and although she struggled at first to master it, she achieved the pronunciation and diction with the help of producer Yash Johar and some of the crew members. Her comic-dramatic performance and Punjabi dialect met with critical acclaim and won her a third Filmfare Award in the Best Actress category. Ziya Us Salam, in a review for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, asserted: &quot;Kajol steals the thunder from under very high noses indeed. With her precise timing and subtle lingering expression, she is a delight all the way.&quot;

Following &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, Kajol took a sabbatical from full-time acting and declined a number of film roles. She has said that she did so to focus on her marriage. Film observers generally perceived at this time that her career was over.

=== Success with intermittent work (2006–2020) ===
Kunal Kohli&#x27;s romantic thriller &quot;Fanaa&quot; (2006) marked Kajol&#x27;s return to films. She portrayed Zooni Ali Beg, a blind Kashmiri woman who unwittingly falls in love with a terrorist (Aamir Khan). The film was promoted as her comeback, a term she disliked saying that she did not retire but only took a break. Upon release, the film was a financial success, grossing against its budget. Both the film and Kajol&#x27;s performance were received well. Sudhish Kamath of &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote Kajol is enough of a reason to watch it, and Deepa Gahlot believed Kajol&#x27;s conviction in the part made up for the film&#x27;s flaws. &quot;Fanaa&quot; fetched Kajol a fourth Filmfare Award and second Zee Cine Award for Best Actress.
Kajol worked intermittently through the rest of the decade. In 2007, she started filming for Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s unreleased mythology film &quot;Ramayana&quot;, based on the epic of the same name, where she played the goddess Sita. She considered her husband&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;U Me Aur Hum&quot; (2008) a special film in her career. In it, she starred as Piya Thapar, a woman suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Although the film underperformed commercially, she received another Filmfare nomination for Best Actress for her performance. &quot;The Economic Times&quot;″ Gaurav Malini noted that Kajol&#x27;s &quot;simmering pace and ... recurring amnesiac spells, rather than getting repetitive, add compelling credibility to the story&quot;.

Kajol was next cast opposite Shah Rukh Khan in &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; (2010), based on the discrimination faced by American Muslims after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It was the first Indian film distributed by Fox Star Studios. It opened to mixed-to-positive reviews, and emerged as an international success. &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; was screened at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival, the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, and the Rome Film Festival. Kajol&#x27;s portrayal of Mandira, a Hindu single mother who marries a Muslim man with Asperger syndrome was praised by Indian and overseas critics. Rajeev Masand wrote positively of Kajol&#x27;s sensitive performance, while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found her to be appealing in an emotion-based role. For the film, Kajol won a record-tying fifth Best Actress award at Filmfare. Additionally, she was nominated for the Screen Award for Best Actress, the Stardust Award for Best Actress in a Drama and the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor – Female.

In the same year, Kajol was the protagonist in Siddharth Malhotra&#x27;s &quot;We Are Family&quot;, an adaptation of the 1998 American drama &quot;Stepmom&quot;, alongside Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal. Kajol played Maya, a character she identified with for being a &quot;control freak&quot; in chase of perfection, and found it largely different from the one played by Susan Sarandon in the original. Malhotra modelled Maya in part after his grandmother Bina Rai. Mayank Shekhar singled out Kajol&#x27;s performance as being better than Sarandon&#x27;s, and Rachel Saltz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that &quot;her naturalism gives the movie a genuine emotional kick&quot;. Kajol&#x27;s next release that year, &quot;Toonpur Ka Super Hero&quot; featured her as Priya Kumar, a woman stuck in a cartoon world. Kajol spoke of the challenge and difficulty dubbing for the film. Dubbed the first Hindi live-action animated film, the film polarised critics and failed to attract an audience. Her role was dismissed as not having provided her with scope to perform. She followed it with a second hiatus upon the birth of her son in 2010 although she provided voiceover to the opening credits of the Hindi version of the fantasy film &quot;Eega&quot;, which released in 2012.

Following a five-year absence, Kajol teamed with Shah Rukh Khan for the seventh time in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s action romance &quot;Dilwale&quot; (2015). She portrayed Meera Dev Malik, the daughter of a mafia don who falls for a man from the rival family. Reviewers were varied in their opinions about the film; &quot;Mint&quot; declared it as the &quot;most tiresome film of the year&quot;. Kajol&#x27;s performance drew positive comments despite a lesser character; in the words of Suhani Singh of &quot;India Today&quot;, &quot;Kajol is a radiant presence on the screen and delivers what&#x27;s expected out of her—which is not much.&quot; &quot;Dilwale&quot; emerged as a major commercial success, grossing more than worldwide, and ranks among of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. Kajol&#x27;s performance garnered Best Actress nominations at various award ceremonies, including Filmfare.

Later that year, she made her debut as a producer with the Marathi period drama &quot;Vitti Dandu&quot;, co-produced by Ajay Devgn and Leena Deore, and exploring the relationship between a grandfather and his grandson. The film won the Best Marathi Film trophy at the Screen Awards and was well received by critics. In 2017, Kajol starred opposite Dhanush in &quot;Velaiilla Pattadhari 2&quot;, a sequel to the 2014 masala film &quot;Velaiilla Pattadhari&quot; and her second Tamil-language film after &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot;. She was cast as Vasundhara Parameshwar, the chairwoman of the construction company Vasundhara Constructions. Kajol was somewhat apprehensive about doing the film but eventually accepted the role due to her faith in Dhanush and director Soundarya Rajinikanth, citing them for giving the bravery she needed to acting in a non-Hindi-language film. &quot;Velaiilla Pattadhari 2&quot; opened to a negative critical reception but succeeded financially.

In 2018, Kajol portrayed a helicopter parent with an aspiration to be a singer who enrolls at her son&#x27;s (Riddhi Sen) college to complete her education in the drama &quot;Helicopter Eela&quot;, based on Anand Gandhi&#x27;s Gujarati play &quot;Beta, Kaagdo&quot;. She was particularly drawn to the role for its colourful personality and her relationship with her son. The feature failed both commercially and with critics, and Kajol&#x27;s performance was not well received. A reviewer for Scroll.in wrote that she &quot;doesn&#x27;t have Riddhi Sen&#x27;s comfort level in the comic scenes. She settles down when the movie finally does.&quot; The same year she dubbed the character Helen Parr in the animated superhero film &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; Hindi version.

By 2020, Kajol said she preferred to consider the importance of character rather than its length. Her first release of the year was the period drama &quot;Tanhaji&quot;, co-starring Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan. Based on the life of Tanaji Malusare, it went onto become the highest-grossing film of the year, earning . She played Tanhaji&#x27;s wife Savitribai whom she called a strong character which she found similar to herself. Critics were appreciative of her turn despite her limited screen time. Later in the year, she was seen in her first short film, &quot;Devi&quot;, a suspense drama about nine women who stay in one room sheltered from the outer world. It was reviewed positively by critics, and Kajol was singled out for leading the diverse ensemble.

=== Streaming projects (2021–present) ===
Kajol&#x27;s next project was Renuka Shahane&#x27;s social drama &quot;Tribhanga&quot; (2021), which marked her first collaboration with Netflix. It revolves around the intergenerational conflicts between three women from one family (Kajol, Mithila Palkar and Tanvi Azmi), with Kajol starring as foul-mouthed Odissi dancer Anuradha Apte. She found resemblance between the relationship of the three leading characters and her own with her mother and daughter. The film and Kajol&#x27;s performance received positive reviews. Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV praised her for providing the thrilling atmosphere the film needs &quot;to keep trundling along at an even pace&quot;; Stutee Ghosh of &quot;The Quint&quot; found Azmi and Kajol&#x27;s strong performances to have &quot;a stunning hold and it&#x27;s difficult to focus on anyone else when they are in the frame&quot;. At the 2nd Filmfare OTT Awards, her performance was nominated in the Best Actress category.

In 2022, Kajol starred in Revathi&#x27;s &quot;Salaam Venky&quot;, a drama about euthanasia. The film and her performance were not well received. It also emerged as a box office bomb. The following year, Kajol starred in a segment of the Netflix anthology film &quot;Lust Stories 2&quot; and in Disney+ Hotstar&#x27;s legal drama series, &quot;The Trial&quot;, an adaptation of the American show &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. Reviewing the latter, Divya Nair of Rediff.com found her &quot;brilliant&quot; and was appreciative of her chemistry with her co-stars. In &quot;Do Patti&quot; (2024), Kajol played a Bihari police officer investigating a domestic abuse case involving twin sisters (Kriti Sanon). &quot;The Hindu&quot; Anuj Kumar praised her for bringing &quot;her innate spontaneity&quot; to the character, though felt that her performance had been limited by weak writing. However, Kartik Bhardwaj of &quot;The New Indian Express&quot; dismissed her role and accent.

Kajol will next star alongside Prithviraj Sukumaran and Ibrahim Ali Khan in the thriller, &quot;Sarzameen.&quot;

== Off-screen work ==

In 1998, Kajol participated in concert tour &quot;Awesome Foursome&quot; alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla, and Akshay Kumar. After travelling across the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, Kajol refused to participate in any more world tours, unable to handle the stress. In 1999, following the launch of Ajay Devgn&#x27;s production company, Devgan Films (renamed as Devgn Entertainment and Software Ltd.), Kajol worked towards building a website: &quot;I&#x27;m computer savvy. Or at least I know more about computers than those around me. So I should be of some help there.&quot;

In 2000, she launched the filmmaking-related online portal Cineexplore for the company, working as the supervisor. Devgn established another company, Ajay Devgn FFilms, in 2009. Kajol clarified she was not involved in its production aspect, but participated in the supervising and overseeing. She featured as a talent judge with husband Ajay Devgn and mother Tanuja in Zee TV&#x27;s 2008 reality show &quot;Rock-N-Roll Family&quot;, which she found to be a much tougher experience than that of in films. She was named a part-time member of the public broadcaster Prasar Bharati in 2016. In 2019, she wrote the foreword of a biography on the actress Sridevi, entitled &quot;&quot;.

Kajol has been actively involved in several philanthropic endeavours related to women and children. She is involved with Shiksha, a non-governmental organisation for children&#x27;s education, and in 2009 she launched a campaign to support the cause. In 2011, Kajol participated in a fashion show organised by the Cancer Patients Aid Association, to generate funds for the organisation, and as the international goodwill ambassador and patron of The Loomba Trust (a charity organisation devoted to supporting widows and their children around the world, particularly in India). In 2012, Kajol was appointed as the brand ambassador of Pratham, a charity organization for children, and she featured in a short film on education and literacy, with the Hanuman Basti Primary School&#x27;s students in Mumbai, to support it. Also that year, she made a documentary about protection of the girl child as a part of the Government of Maharashtra&#x27;s campaign &quot;Save the Girl Child&quot;. For her contribution in social service, Kajol was awarded the Karmaveer Puraskar.

== Personal life ==

Kajol began dating actor Ajay Devgn in 1994, while filming &quot;Gundaraj&quot;. Members of the media, however, labelled them as an &quot;unlikely pair&quot; due to their contrasting personalities. Devgn explained their relationship by saying, &quot;We never resorted to the usual &#x27;I love you&#x27; routine. A proposal never happened. We grew with each other. Marriage was never discussed, but it was always imminent&quot;. The couple married on 24 February 1999 in a traditional Maharashtrian ceremony at Devgn&#x27;s house. The wedding was subject to wide media scrutiny, as certain members of the media criticised Kajol&#x27;s decision to settle down at the pinnacle of her career. Kajol, however, maintained that she would not quit films, but would cut down on the amount of work that she did.

Following her marriage, Kajol moved in with Devgn and his parents at the latter&#x27;s ancestral house in Juhu. Tabloids have often romantically linked Devgn with other Bollywood actresses, and reported an imminent divorce. Dismissing the rumors as gossip, Kajol attested to not paying attention to such talk.
Kajol prefers not to talk much about her personal life and dislikes being interviewed, considering it &quot;a waste of time&quot;. She gave birth to a daughter, Nysa, on 20 April 2003. Seven years later, on 13 September 2010, she gave birth to a son, Yug. She described motherhood as &quot;fab&quot; and added that her kids brought out &quot;the best in her&quot;. Kajol has used Devgn as her surname since 2015. She speaks English, Hindi and Marathi, and can understand Bengali.

== Screen persona and reception ==

Kajol is acknowledged for her natural acting prowess. &quot;The Hindu&quot; stated she &quot;does not act out her scenes and deliver her lines; she inhabits her characters.&quot; After portraying leading roles in a series of family dramas, Kajol showed her acting versatility with &quot;Gupt: The Hidden Truth&quot; (1997), for which she was noted as being one of the first actresses of her era to play female anti-hero characters and becoming more popular than the male actors. She was also praised for her lively and spirited nature on-screen. Rajiv Menon credited Kajol as representing the &quot;joie de vivre&quot; of the 1990s, and Khalid Mohammed described her as &quot;a great packet of talent&quot;. According to &quot;Open&quot;, her spontaneity brought &quot;a unique energy&quot; to her films, and Karan Johar said, &quot;I would call &#x27;action&#x27; on a shoot and expect a little atom bomb explosion on set every time Kajol was around because that is who she was. She kept us all on our toes.&quot; The scholar Ashish Rajadhyaksha observed that she was the actress &quot;around whom a script can be written and a film made&quot;. Film distributor Ramesh Sippy stated that she added prospects to films she starred in.

Unlike most of her contemporaries, Kajol has had a successful career post-marriage and motherhood, for which she was characterised as &quot;the archetypal New Age woman&quot;. On breaking the stereotype, she opined: &quot;Perceptions have changed a lot in the last few years. Married actresses don&#x27;t necessarily have to play character roles in films. Filmmakers are experimenting and this is truly the best time for actresses like us.&quot; Following her marriage, journalists speculated it would be the ending point of her career. She continued to work in films but has been more selective, attributing it to the lack of worthy offers and her unwillingness to see herself in &quot;films that are absolutely meaningless&quot;.

== In the media ==
Known for her impulsive and stubborn nature, Kajol has been described by commentators to have a striking personality. Sukanya Verma wrote, &quot;Think Kajol, think emotions. Either she is the firebrand or the emotional sensitive type. And sometimes she is pure, wicked fun.&quot; While interviewing her for the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; in 2008, the journalist Hiren Kotwani took note of her straightforwardness when she was answering the given questions. &quot;India Today&quot; presumed that her outspoken behaviour have contributed in helping her winning film awards, and further commented, &quot;There is a sparkling spontaneity to Kajol ... Film brats are rapidly tutored on the conventional wisdom of the industry, the line to success that needs to be toed. Maybe Tanuja never taught it, maybe Kajol never listened, for she has abandoned the predictable.&quot;

Kajol has been criticised for her lack of interest in maintaining her appearance. Gautam Rajadhyaksha stated she was apathetic of hairstyles and clothes, and would be really happy if she was allowed to wear jeans, a white shirt, and a scarf every day. The journalist Kaveree Bamzai elaborated, &quot;She hardly looks into the mirror, barely even glances at the set monitor, usually the crutch of every insecure actor, puts on make-up only under extreme duress, and ... never watches her old movies.&quot; Comparing her to Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil, the producer Mahesh Bhatt observed that Kajol &quot;may not have [their] earthy sensuality but she has that extra sparkle in her eyes and a kind of energy she generates on screen which make her incredible&quot;. &quot;Filmfare&quot; however labelled her an &quot;unconventional beauty&quot;, adding that she &quot;set her own rules in the &#x27;90s&quot;.

Kajol was listed in Box Office India&#x27;s &quot;Top Actresses&quot; for five consecutive years (1995–1999), topping the list in 1998. In 2001 and 2006, Kajol featured in Rediff.com&#x27;s annual &quot;Top Bollywood Actresses&quot; listing. Rediff.com also featured her in other lists: &quot;Best Bollywood Actresses Ever&quot;, &quot;Best Dressed Woman&quot; and &quot;Top 10 Actresses of 2000–2010&quot;. She peaked the fifth position as &quot;the all-time favorite female star&quot; in a 2008 poll conducted by &quot;Outlook&quot;. In 2012, Kajol was placed at the fourth position by NDTV in the listing of &quot;The Most Popular Actress of All Time&quot;, behind Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi and Meena Kumari, and Yahoo! featured her as &quot;one of the ten most iconic beauties of Hindi cinema&quot;. Kajol was included on &quot;Forbes India&quot;″s &quot;Celebrity 100&quot;, a list based on the income and popularity of India&#x27;s celebrities, in 2012, 2013 and 2017.

In 2002, Kajol was presented with the Rajiv Gandhi Awards by the Mumbai Pradesh Youth Congress. She was one of the four Bollywood actors, alongside Priyanka Chopra, Hrithik Roshan and Shah Rukh Khan, whose miniature dolls were launched in the United Kingdom, under the name of &quot;Bollywood Legends&quot; in 2006. Kajol and Khan also became the first Indian actors to be invited by NASDAQ to open the NYSE American for promoting their film, &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; (2010). In the next year, the Government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian honour of the country, for her contribution to India&#x27;s cinema. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis honoured her with the Swabhimani Mumbaikar Awards. Kajol unveiled her wax statue at Singapore&#x27;s Madame Tussauds museum in 2018.

<text>East Claydon is a village and is also a civil parish in the unitary authority of Buckinghamshire, England. It is about south-west of Winslow.

The village name &#x27;Claydon&#x27; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and derives from the + &quot;dun&quot; meaning &#x27;clay hill&#x27;. The affix &#x27;East&#x27; is used to differentiate the village from nearby Steeple Claydon and Middle Claydon, and from the hamlet of Botolph Claydon that lies within the parish of East Claydon.

The parish church dedicated to St Mary was demolished during the English Civil War by Cornelius Holland, one of King Charles&#x27;s judges, but was rebuilt after the restoration. The current structure is largely of 18th century design, but comprises components from various centuries, the earliest of which is the 13th century.

East Claydon School is a mixed, community, nursery, infant and junior school, which takes children from the age of three through to the age of 11, when they generally move to a school in Waddesdon or Winslow. The school is quite small, with approximately seventy pupils.

<text>Edgcott is a village and a civil parish in Buckinghamshire district in the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the Aylesbury Vale, about eight miles east of Bicester.

The village name is derived from the Old English for &quot;oak cottage&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it is recorded as &quot;Achecote&quot;, &quot;æcen&quot; (from which the word &quot;acorn&quot; is derived) being the Old English word for oak.

The manor of Edgcott was once owned by the physician and poet Sir Samuel Garth.

The village also has HM Prison Grendon located nearby.

In 1807 Edgcott was described as:The property is divided among a few. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Oxford. The church is old but good. There is an Independent chapel.

== Population ==
The parish had a population of 256 people according to the 2011 censusEdgcott&#x27;s population during the 1830s had a very small pool of job occupations, with the only noticeable job being an agricultural labourer. Obviously there are employers at this time who own the land and need manpower to work it, and according to the &#x27;A Vision of Britain through Time&#x27;, there were 4. This model of industry present in Edgcott is predictable, due to the poor transport modes in that time. People couldn&#x27;t travel very far to work so needed to work locally, therefore everyone who lived in Edgcott would most likely be working the land there.
The following graph shows the number of people in their different age brackets who reside in Edgcott. The data used is from 2001 and shows a top heavy population, with the majority of the population being aged between 30 and 59. 141 people are in this bracket, which is approximately 55% of the population. 
== St. Michael&#x27;s Church ==
The Church dates back to the 12th century, with many rebuilding and restorations occurring through the years. Main restorations took place in 1604 and 1875. The building was added to gradually; in the 12th century the nave and chancel were built, and then in the 15th century the west steeple was constructed. The vestry was added in the 1875 restorations.

St. Michael&#x27;s is a listed building under the Planning Act of 1990 due to its architectural and historic features.

== Parish Council ==
There is an active parish council in Edgcott, meeting every six weeks in the evening. Meetings are held in the village hall, with the current chairman being Peter Harper. They contribute to decisions ranging from planning permission to extend a property, to fundraising for the local community.

They recently approved and carried out street light repairs in 2015 to 2016 which cost over £400, illustrating their active role in the village.

== HM Prison Grendon ==
This institution was opened in 1962 but was originally an experimental psychiatric prison, which dealt with prisoners with antisocial personality disorders.

It changed to operate as a normal prison since opening, with it being able to accommodate 238 inmates in Category B security conditions, however it still offers therapeutic care to offenders. Inmates must be over 21 years of age to be eligible of residence in the prison, as well as other requirements such as committing to be drug-free and work to change their ways. The governor as of 2016 is Jamie Bennett.

<doc id="402866" wikidata="Q213787" url="?curid=402866" title="The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)">
<text>The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a 1996 American animated musical drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is loosely based on the 1831 novel of the same name by Victor Hugo. The film was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise and produced by Don Hahn, from a screenplay written by Tab Murphy, Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and the writing team of Bob Tzudiker and Noni White. Featuring the voices of Tom Hulce, Demi Moore, Tony Jay, and Kevin Kline, the film follows Quasimodo, the deformed and confined bell-ringer of Notre Dame, and his yearning to explore the outside world and be accepted by society, against the wishes of his cruel, puritanical foster father Claude Frollo, who also wants to exterminate Paris&#x27; Roma population.

In 1993, David Stainton, then a development executive at Disney Feature Animation, conceived the idea to adapt Victor Hugo&#x27;s Gothic fiction novel into an animated feature. He subsequently pitched the idea to then-Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg. At Katzenberg&#x27;s request, Trousdale, Wise, and Hahn joined the project in 1993. Murphy wrote the first draft of the script, and Mecchi and Roberts, who had rewritten the script for &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), were soon brought in. Additional rewrites were provided by Tzudiker and White. That same year, the production team embarked on a research trip to Paris to study the Notre-Dame cathedral and additional locations for the film. The musical score was composed by Alan Menken, with songs written by Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz.

&quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; premiered at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans on June 19, 1996, and was released in the United States on June 21. It is considered different from Disney&#x27;s other films due to its mature themes such as infanticide, lust, antiziganism, and genocide, despite the changes made from the original source material in order to ensure a G rating from the MPAA. The film received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success, grossing over $325 million worldwide and becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 1996. It was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for its musical score. A stage adaptation of the film was produced by Walt Disney Theatrical in 1999. A direct-to-video sequel, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot;, was released in 2002.

== Plot ==

Clopin, a Roma puppeteer, narrates the story of a mysterious bell-ringer to a group of children.

A group of Roma immigrating to Paris are ambushed by Judge Claude Frollo, Paris&#x27; Minister of Justice, and his soldiers. One woman attempts to flee with her baby, reaching the doors of Notre Dame pleading for sanctuary. Frollo chases her down and knocks her onto the cathedral&#x27;s steps, where she fractures her skull and dies. Seeing her baby&#x27;s deformed appearance, Frollo believes it to be a demon and tries drowning the child but is thwarted by the archdeacon, who scolds Frollo for murdering an innocent woman. Afraid for his soul, Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the child as his own, naming him &quot;Quasimodo&quot; (meaning &#x27;half-formed&#x27;) and hiding him away in the cathedral&#x27;s bell tower.

Twenty years later, Quasimodo has grown into a kind yet isolated young man, now with a pronounced hunchback caused by kyphosis. He is also incredibly strong, due to years of ringing Notre Dame&#x27;s heavy bells. He has lived his entire life in the cathedral with his only company being a trio of living stone gargoyles Victor, Hugo, and Laverne. The gargoyles encourage him to attend the annual Festival of Fools, despite Frollo&#x27;s warnings that he would be shunned for his appearance. Quasimodo attends and is celebrated for his appearance but then, prompted by Frollo&#x27;s guards, is humiliated by the crowd. Frollo refuses Quasimodo&#x27;s pleas for help, but he is rescued by Esmeralda, a kind Roma who stands up to Frollo for his tyranny. Intending to commit genocide against Roma people living in Paris, Frollo orders Esmeralda&#x27;s arrest, but she escapes using a magic trick.

Quasimodo retreats back into the cathedral, followed by Esmeralda and Captain Phoebus of Frollo&#x27;s guard. Phoebus refuses to arrest her for witchcraft inside Notre Dame and instead tells Frollo that she has claimed asylum. Esmeralda finds and befriends Quasimodo, who helps her escape Notre Dame out of gratitude for defending him. She entrusts Quasimodo with a pendant containing a map to the Roma hideout called the Court of Miracles. Frollo develops an obsessive lust for Esmeralda and, upon realizing this, begs the Virgin Mary to save him from her &quot;spell&quot; and avoid eternal damnation.

When Frollo discovers Esmeralda&#x27;s escape, he searches for her, bribing and arresting Travellers/Roma and setting fire to houses while trying to find her. Phoebus defies Frollo when ordered to burn down a house with a family inside and Frollo orders him executed. Phoebus flees but is struck by an arrow and falls into the River Seine, where he is found by Esmeralda and taken to Notre Dame for refuge. The gargoyles encourage Quasimodo to confess his feelings for Esmeralda, but he is heartbroken to discover she and Phoebus have fallen in love. Realizing that Quasimodo helped Esmeralda escape, Frollo tells him he knows about the Court of Miracles and plans to attack it at dawn. Using the map Esmeralda gave him, Quasimodo and Phoebus find the court to warn the Roma, only for Frollo to follow them and capture all the Roma present.

When Esmeralda again rejects Frollo&#x27;s advances, he attempts to burn her at the stake at Place du Parvis, but Quasimodo swoops down and carries her to the cathedral tower, crying &quot;Sanctuary!&quot; from the ledge. When Frollo attempts to seize the cathedral, Phoebus releases the Roma and rallies the Paris citizens against Frollo&#x27;s guards. Quasimodo and the gargoyles pour molten lead onto the streets to prevent anyone entering, but Frollo himself manages to break into the cathedral beforehand. Violating the tradition of sanctuary, he pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda to the bell tower with the intent of killing them both. He and Quasimodo fight, eventually both falling from a ledge. Frollo plummets to his death in the molten lead while Quasimodo is saved by Phoebus. Afterwards, Quasimodo accepts Phoebus and Esmeralda&#x27;s love, and he gives them his blessing. They encourage him to leave the cathedral; when he does so, the people of Paris hail him as a hero.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
The idea to adapt &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; came from development executive David Stainton in 1993, who was inspired to turn Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; into an animated feature film after reading the Classics Illustrated comic book adaptation. Stainton then proposed the idea to then-studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg. After the release of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), Gary Trousdale had taken a sabbatical break from directing, instead spending several months developing storyboards for &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). Following this, Trousdale and his directing and writing partner Kirk Wise subsequently developed an animated feature based on the Greek myth of &quot;Orpheus and Eurydice&quot; titled &quot;A Song of the Sea&quot;, adapting it to make the central character a humpback whale and setting it in the open ocean. While they were working on the project they were summoned to meet with Katzenberg. &quot;During that time,&quot; explained Trousdale, &quot;while we working on it, we got a call from Jeffrey. He said, &#x27;Guys, drop everything – you&#x27;re working on &quot;Hunchback&quot; now. According to Wise, they believed that it had &quot;a great deal of potential... great memorable characters, a really terrific setting, the potential for fantastic visuals, and a lot of emotion.&quot;

Production on &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; began in the summer of 1993. In October 1993, directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, art director David Goetz, Roy Conli, Ed Ghertner, Will Finn, Alan Menken, and Stephen Schwartz took a trip to Paris for ten days; three days were devoted to exploring the Notre Dame cathedral where the team took photographs and sketched areas of the religious site, included passageways, stairwells, towers, and a hidden room. The team also located books that documented the cathedral&#x27;s restricted areas, including one about Victor Hugo&#x27;s watercolor paintings. Goetz stated, &quot;It turned out that his paintings were very similar in tone to what we were coming with for our early visual development work ... We were a little tentative because it seemed like an un-Disney thing. Then we went to Paris and saw the Hugo paintings and the work of other illustrators of the time. We felt they were so similar that we were really on a track that was appropriate ... We thought, heck, let&#x27;s go with it.&quot; The team also visited the Palace of Justice and an original location of the Court of Miracles.

=== Writing ===
Tab Murphy was brought on board to write the screenplay, and it was decided early on that Quasimodo would be the center of the story, as he was in preceding live-action film adaptations. In the early drafts, Quasimodo served as a Cyrano between Phoebus and Esmeralda, but it was discarded to focus more on Quasimodo. Meanwhile, a love story between Quasimodo and Esmeralda was also conceived, according to Murphy, but &quot;we decided to make Phoebus more heroic and central to the story. Out of that decision grew the idea of some sort of a triangle between Quasimodo, Esmeralda and Phoebus.&quot; Some of the novel&#x27;s key characters were jettisoned entirely. The gargoyles of Notre Dame were added to the story by Trousdale and Wise. Their portrayal as comedic friends and confidantes of Quasimodo was inspired by a portion of the novel, which reads: &quot;The other statues, the ones of monsters and demons, felt no hatred for Quasimodo…The saints were his friends and blessed him; the monsters were his friends, and protected him. Thus he would pour out his heart at length to them.&quot;

One of the first changes made to accommodate Disney&#x27;s request was to turn the villainous Claude Frollo into a judge rather than an archdeacon, thus avoiding religious sensibilities in the finished film. &quot;As we were exploring the characters, especially Frollo, we certainly found a lot of historical parallels to the type of mania he had: the Confederate South, Nazi Germany, take your pick,&quot; explained Wise. &quot;Those things influenced our thinking.&quot; Producer Don Hahn evaluated that one inspiration for Frollo was found in Ralph Fiennes&#x27;s performance as Amon Goeth in &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), who had murdered Jews yet lusted after his Jewish maid.

For the opening sequence, Disney story veteran Burny Mattinson constructed an effective sequence that covered much exposition, although Katzenberg felt something was missing. Following Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s suggestion to musicalize the sequence, French animators Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi storyboarded the sequence to Menken and Schwartz&#x27;s music resulting in &quot;The Bells of Notre Dame&quot;. Lyricist Stephen Schwartz also worked closely with the writing team even suggesting that the audience should be left wondering what the outcome of what Phoebus would do before he extinguishes the torch in water in retaliation against Frollo.

=== Casting ===
In late 1993, pop singer Cyndi Lauper was the first actor cast during the film&#x27;s initial stages. She had been hired one week after reading for a part with the directors, who felt her performance was &quot;hilarious and sweet&quot;. Thinking she had been cast as Esmeralda, Lauper was startled to learn she was to voice a gargoyle named Quinn. The development team had come up with the names of Chaney, Laughton and Quinn—named after the actors who portrayed Quasimodo in preceding &quot;Hunchback&quot; film adaptations. However, Disney&#x27;s legal department objected to the proposed names of the gargoyles, fearing that the estates of Lon Chaney, Charles Laughton, or Anthony Quinn (who was still alive at the time) would file a lawsuit over the unauthorized use of their names, so the idea was dropped. Trousdale and Wise then suggested naming the characters Lon, Charles, and Anthony, which would have resulted in the same legal concern. Instead, they would name the first two gargoyles after Victor Hugo, and the third gargoyle after Andrews Sisters singer LaVerne Andrews as suggested by Wise.

Now cast as Laverne, Lauper was deemed too youthful for a friend who would provide wise counsel to Quasimodo. At the same time, Sam McMurray—best known for his work on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;—was hired for Hugo. Meanwhile, Charles Kimbrough was cast as Victor, who was initially unimpressed at an animated adaptation of &quot;Hunchback&quot;, but later became rather impressed at the level of research that went into the film and how the story ideas transitioned from the novel to the screen. After several recording sessions and test screenings, Lauper and McMurray were called by the directors who released them from their roles. At one point, Jeffrey Katzenberg had considered Arsenio Hall, David Letterman, and Jay Leno to voice the gargoyles, but he eventually cast Jason Alexander, due to his previous role in &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; (1994). After a suggestion by supervising animator Will Finn, Laverne was then re-envisioned into a wiser, mature character with Mary Wickes cast in the role. Following Wickes&#x27; death in October 1995, Jane Withers was hired to voice her six remaining lines.

Katzenberg had also wanted Meat Loaf for the role of Quasimodo, but he passed on the role after Disney could not come to an agreement with his record company. Mandy Patinkin was also approached for the title role, but his style of portraying Quasimodo collided with the producers&#x27; demands, and Patinkin stated, I [was] just there at the audition [and I] said, &#x27;I can&#x27;t do this. Tom Hulce was cast as Quasimodo following his first audition for the role, and according to the actor, he noticed during the audition that the Disney executives, producers, and directors &quot;were staring at the floor. It looked like everyone was at a memorial service&quot; until he noticed the floor was lined with storyboard sketches. According to Wise, the filmmakers &quot;like to audition the voices with our eyes closed, so we see the character&#x27;s face.&quot; Quasimodo was originally portrayed as older and with more of a speech impediment during the early rehearsals, but Hulce commented that &quot;we experimented, endlessly. At one point I was ready to call in and say &#x27;Things just aren&#x27;t happening&#x27;.&quot; Ultimately, the directors desired to portray Quasimodo with a younger voice different from the previous portrayals since &quot;[Victor] Hugo described Quasimodo as 20.&quot; Additionally, Hulce was permitted to do his own singing after performing a demo recording of &quot;Out There&quot;.

Due to her deeper voice than actresses who had previously played Disney heroines, Demi Moore was cast as Esmeralda, and met with Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz on singing. After several singing demos, the actress said, &quot;You&#x27;d better get someone else,&quot; according to Schwartz. New York City cabaret singer Heidi Mollenhauer was selected to provide the singing voice. For the role of Phoebus, co-director Kirk Wise explained that &quot;As we&#x27;re designing the characters, we form a short list of names...to help us find the personality of the character.&quot; Subsequently, the filmmakers modeled his portrayal on the personalities of Errol Flynn and John Wayne, and &quot;One of the names on the top of the list all the time was Kevin Kline.&quot; Moore and Kline were the only actors to have the role directly offered to them instead of auditioning. British actor Tony Jay, who declared his role as Frollo as his &quot;bid for immortality&quot;, was cast after the directors had worked with him in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991). Anthony Hopkins was originally considered for the role, but he turned down the offer. After watching his portrayal as Uncle Ernie in the musical &quot;The Who&#x27;s Tommy&quot;, Broadway actor Paul Kandel was selected to voice Clopin.

=== Animation ===
Alongside &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), storyboard work on &quot;The Hunchback of the Notre Dame&quot; was among the first to be produced for an animated film on the new Disney Feature Animation building adjacent to the main Disney lot in Burbank, which was dedicated in 1995. However, most animators were occupied with &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994) and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995) at the time, and as a result, more animators were hired from Canada and United Kingdom to join the production team for the film. As the development phase furthered along, most of the entire animation team moved out into a large warehouse facility on Airway in Glendale, California. As the Disney story artists, layout crew, and animators moved in their new quarters, they decided to name the building &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

Since &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), other animators hired by Disney Feature Animation were from Germany, France, Ireland, and additional ones from Canada were involved in providing animation duties at the recently opened satellite studio, Walt Disney Animation Paris. Supervised by coproducer Roy Conli, 20 percent of the film was done there. To coordinate with the Burbank studio, the Brizzis traveled there with storyboards and conferred with the directors, animators, and layout team. Back in Paris, they discuss their animation dailies via video conferences provided by Compression Lab Industries&#x27; (CLI) video system. Meanwhile, at the Feature Animation Florida studio, which had been working on &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), their first in-house production, at least seven animators penned about four minutes of screen time, which mostly involved Frollo and Quasimodo. The studio had also provided additional layout, cleanup, and special-effects animation.

During early development, Trousdale and Wise realized they needed crowds of people, but for this time, they wanted them to move as opposed to being traditionally drawn as painted backdrops. Recalling the wildebeest stampede in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), they landed on the idea of using computer animation to generate them. For that reason, the CGI department, headed by Kiran Joshi, created the software &quot;Crowd&quot; to achieve large-scale crowd scenes, particularly for the Feast of Fools sequence and the film&#x27;s climax. The software was used to create six types of characters—males and females either average in weight, fat, or thin—which were programmed and assigned 72 specific movements ranging from jumping and clapping. Digital technology also provided a visual sweep that freed Quasimodo to scamper around the cathedral and soar around the plaza to rescue Esmeralda.

=== Editing ===
Although the film did deviate from the source material&#x27;s darker elements to receive a G rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), it initially received a PG rating after being submitted to the rating board. The reasons were a scene in which Frollo sniffs Esmeralda&#x27;s hair and Frollo saying the word &quot;sin&quot; in the song &quot;Hellfire&quot;. Hahn suggested toning down the sniffing sound effect and making the word less obvious by turning up the background sound effects. In turn, this resulted in the film receiving a G rating after its resubmission.

=== Music ===
Having worked on &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995) for a year, Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz were offered multiple film projects to collaborate on when they chose to work on &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. According to Schwartz, they had both been attracted to underlying themes of social outcast and Quasimodo&#x27;s struggle to break free of the psychological abuse of Frollo.

The film has many musical motifs that carry throughout the film, weaving their way in and out of various pieces of music, and having varying timbres depending on the action in the story at that point. The film&#x27;s soundtrack includes a musical score composed by Menken, and songs written by him and Stephen Schwartz. The film&#x27;s songs include &quot;The Bells of Notre Dame&quot; for Clopin, Frollo, and the Archdeacon, &quot;Out There&quot; for Quasimodo and Frollo, &quot;Topsy Turvy&quot; for Clopin, &quot;God Help the Outcasts&quot; for Esmeralda, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Light&quot; for Quasimodo, &quot;Hellfire&quot; for the Archdeacon and Frollo, &quot;A Guy Like You&quot; for the gargoyles, and &quot;The Court of Miracles&quot; for Clopin and the other Roma.

Three songs written for the film were discarded for the storyboarding process. Trousdale and Wise were not certain what musical number could be placed for the third act, though Menken and Schwartz conceived two love songs, &quot;In a Place of Miracles&quot; and &quot;As Long as There&#x27;s a Moon&quot;, between Esmeralda and Phoebus in the film. However, Trousdale and Wise felt the song took too much focus off of Quasimodo, and ultimately decided to have Clopin sing about sentencing Phoebus and Quasimodo to death for finding their Roma sanctuary. Menken and Schwartz had also written &quot;Someday&quot; originally for the film, but the directors suggested that a religious song be sung in the cathedral. The song was instead featured in the end credits. R&amp;B group All-4-One recorded the song for the end credits of the North American English release, and by the British R&amp;B girl group Eternal in the British English version. Luis Miguel recorded the version for the Latin American Spanish version, which became a major hit.

== Themes and interpretations ==
&quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;″s thematic concerns include infanticide, lust, damnation, and sin, as well as the belief in a loving, forgiving God. According to Mark Pinsky, it is also a &quot;condemnation of abortion, euthanasia, and racism, and [a] moral resistance to genocide.&quot;

&quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; was the first—and currently only—Disney animated feature to have a major focus on traditional religious faith; in this case, pre-Reformation Catholicism. In fact, the words &quot;God,&quot; &quot;Lord&quot;, and &quot;Hell&quot; are uttered more times in this film than in any other produced by Disney. The book &quot;The Gospel According to Disney&quot; explains that &quot;it is the church... that interposes, or attempts to interpose itself between the villain and his evil intentions.&quot; During production, the studio executives expressed concerns about various aspects of the film, especially those relating to the religious content in the story, &quot;for their failure to defend the poor and the powerless&quot; and concerns that the story was &quot;too controversial&quot;. Another book &quot;Deconstructing Disney&quot; notes that the studio &quot;approached the name of God with an almost Hebraic zeal (that it should never be stated) yet here it is invoked in a manner both pious and puritan.&quot; Many of the songs were adapted from genuine Latin prayers and chants, such as &quot;Hellfire&quot;, which uses the Tridentine form of the Confiteor as a counterpoint melody. &quot;The Gospel According to Disney&quot; includes a quote that says &quot;religion... appears as an impotent, irrelevant caricature [and] Disney refuses to admit a serious role for religion.&quot; At one point, the archdeacon says to Esmeralda, &quot;You can&#x27;t right all the wrongs of this world by yourself... perhaps there is someone in here who can,&quot; referring either to God or Mary. This questions the power religious people actually have in making the world a moral and happy place, according to Pinsky.

&quot;The Gospel According to Disney&quot; explains that &quot;while Frollo&#x27;s stated goal is to purge the world of vice and sin, according to the opening song, he &#x27;saw corruption everywhere except within.&#x27;&quot; Because &quot;killing the woman on the steps has put Frollo&#x27;s soul in mortal danger,&quot; he has to take the child and look after him as penance. Even then, he absolves himself of agency in the murder by claiming &quot;God works in mysterious ways,&quot; and ponders whether &quot;the child may be of use to him one day.&quot; During the song &quot;God Help the Outcasts&quot;, Esmeralda wonders if &quot;Were you once an outcast too?&quot; while looking at a statue of Mary with the infant Jesus, referencing the Flight into Egypt.

According to the film&#x27;s production notes, Quasimodo is &quot;symbolically viewed as being an angel in a devil&#x27;s body.&quot; He is &quot;trapped between heaven above [and] the gritty streets of urban Paris viewed as Hell.&quot; The version of the alphabet Quasimodo recites in a daily ritual reflects Frollo&#x27;s view of the world – full of abominations and blasphemy. He is also constantly called deformed, ugly, a monster, and an outcast who would be hated if he ever left the confines of the church.

== Release ==
In 1994, the film was scheduled for a Christmas 1995 release, though the film was reportedly delayed following the departure of Katzenberg from The Walt Disney Company. By January 1995, it was later pushed back to a summer 1996 release. The film premiered on June 19, 1996, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, where it was played on six enormous screens. The premiere was preceded by a parade through the French Quarter, beginning at Jackson Square and utilizing floats and cast members from Walt Disney World. The film was widely released two days later.

=== Marketing ===
As part of the promotion of the film, Walt Disney Records shipped two million products, including sing-along home videos, soundtrack CDs, and the &quot;My First Read Along&quot; novelized version of the film. Upon release, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; was accompanied by a marketing campaign of more than $40 million with commercial tie-ins with Burger King, Payless Shoes, Nestlé, and Mattel. By 1997, Disney earned approximately $500 million in profit with the spin-off products based from the film.

=== Home media ===
&quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; was first released on VHS, standard CLV LaserDisc, and special edition CAV LaserDisc on March 4, 1997, under the &quot;Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection&quot; label. By mid-1998, the operating income of the VHS release had accumulated to $200 million. It was originally planned for a DVD release in December 2000 as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection, but instead, it was re-issued on March 19, 2002, as a special edition along with its direct-to-video sequel, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot; (2002).

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; on Blu-ray alongside its sequel in a Special Edition &quot;2-Movie Collection&quot; on March 12, 2013.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; grossed $21.3 million during its opening weekend, ranking in second place at the box office behind Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s &quot;Eraser&quot;. At the time, both Warner Bros. and Disney already had big summer hits with &quot;Twister&quot; and &quot;The Rock&quot; respectively. In a new box office strategy, Disney also included ticket sales which were sold from Disney Stores nationwide, which added about $1 million to the box office numbers. However, the film had earned slightly less when compared to &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, which had grossed $29 million the year previous. Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook defended the results claiming it was comparable to &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), which opened in half as many theaters, and grossed about $9 million. In its second weekend, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; dropped into third place behind &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; and &quot;Eraser&quot;, but stayed above &quot;Striptease&quot; and made a total $14.3 million.

In France, the film collected an opening gross of $6.5 million within its first five days of release, which was the country&#x27;s third-highest opening of 1996, after &quot;&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;.

Ultimately, the film grossed just over $100.1 million domestically. In foreign markets, by December 1996, the film became the fifteenth film that year to gross over $100 million, and went on to accumulate $225.2 million, surpassing &quot;Pocahontas&quot;″ $204.5 million international gross. Worldwide, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; grossed over $325.3 million, making it the fifth highest-grossing film of 1996.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; received generally positive reviews from film critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film positive rating based on reviews, along with an average rating of . The consensus reads, &quot;Disney&#x27;s take on the Victor Hugo classic is dramatically uneven, but its strong visuals, dark themes, and message of tolerance make for a more-sophisticated-than-average children&#x27;s film.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 74 based on 28 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert rewarded the film 4 stars, calling it &quot;the best Disney animated feature since &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; – a whirling, uplifting, thrilling story with a heart touching message that emerges from the comedy and song.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Gene Siskel awarded the film (out of a possible 4) stars, describing the film as &quot;a surprisingly emotional, simplified version of the Victor Hugo novel&quot; with &quot;effective songs and, yes, tasteful bits of humor.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the film an A, labeling it as &quot;the best of Disney&#x27;s &#x27;serious&#x27; animated features in the multiplex era, (...) an emotionally rounded fairy tale that balances darkness and sentimentality, pathos and triumph, with uncanny grace.&quot;

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised the film, stating that &quot;the result is a grand cartoon cathedral, teeming with gargoyles and treachery, hopeless love and tortured lust&quot; and also said &quot;Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz have written the largest, most imposing score yet for an animated film.&quot; Charles Spencer of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; gave it a positive review, saying &quot;it is thrillingly dramatic, and for long stretches you forget you are watching a cartoon at all... A dazzling treat.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; also gave the film a positive review, stating that &quot;there is much to admire in &quot;Hunchback&quot;, not least the risk of doing such a downer of a story at all&quot; and also saying: &quot;the new film should further secure Disney&#x27;s dominance in animation, and connoisseurs of the genre, old and young, will have plenty to savor.&quot; Janet Maslin wrote in her &quot;The New York Times&quot; review: &quot;In a film that bears conspicuous, eager resemblances to other recent Disney hits, the filmmakers&#x27; Herculean work is overshadowed by a Sisyphean problem. There&#x27;s just no way to delight children with a feel-good version of this story.&quot;

Upon opening in France in March 1997, reception from French critics towards &quot;Hunchback&quot; was largely positive. French critics and audiences found resonance in the film which recounted a real-life incident from August 1995 when French police raided a Parisian church and seized over 200 immigrants seeking refuge from deportation under France&#x27;s strict expulsion laws. &quot;It is difficult not to think of the undocumented immigrants of St. Bernard when Frollo tries to sweep out the rabble,&quot; wrote one reviewer.

=== Audience response ===
Arnaud Later, a leading scholar on Hugo, accused Disney of simplifying, editing, and censoring the novel in numerous aspects, including the personalities of the characters. In his review, he later wrote that the animators &quot;don&#x27;t have enough confidence in their own emotional feeling&quot; and that the film &quot;falls back on clichés.&quot; Descendants of Hugo bashed Disney in an open letter to the &quot;Libération&quot; newspaper for their ancestor receiving no mention on the advertisement posters, and describing the film as a &quot;vulgar commercialization by unscrupulous salesmen.&quot;

Some audiences expressed concerns about whether the film was appropriate for children. Jason Alexander said that while &quot;Disney would have us believe this movie&#x27;s like the Ringling Bros., for children of all ages,&quot; he would not take his then-four-year-old child to view the film. However, some newspaper publications reported child audiences being unaffected by the mature content and praising the film. Some audiences criticized the film for having &quot;homosexual undertones&quot;, noticeably with the song &quot;Out There&quot;, being the name of a gay pressure group and as a call to come out of the closet.

In June 1996, the Southern Baptist Convention voted overwhelmingly to urge its sixteen million members to boycott Disney films, theme parks, and merchandise, saying the company &quot;disparages Christian values.&quot; The cause of the protests—unrelated to the film—stemmed from the company&#x27;s domestic partnership policy and gay and lesbian theme days at Walt Disney World. Trousdale also claimed that Southern Baptists were outraged over the casting of Demi Moore as Esmeralda, as she had just come off of the film &quot;Striptease&quot; (1996), in which she played an exotic dancer. Disney officials would not comment on the motivation for the religious content displayed in the film beyond comments on the subject included in the film&#x27;s press kit, with Disney vice president John Dreyer commenting, &quot;The film speaks for itself.&quot; Nevertheless, there was praise from religious organizations for its portrayal of religion in the film. Louis P. Sheldon, a Presbyterian pastor and chairman of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, said two months before its premiere: &quot;I am thrilled at what I hear about &quot;Hunchback&quot;, that Disney is seeking to honour Christianity and its role in Western civilization. I only pray that it will accomplish much good in the minds and hearts of its viewers.&quot;

Following protests in the United States, thousands of British parents banned their kids from seeing &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. In reaction to the controversy, Walt Disney Feature Animation president Peter Schneider said, &quot;The only controversy I&#x27;ve heard about the movie is certain people&#x27;s opinion that, &#x27;Well, it&#x27;s OK for me, but it might disturb somebody else.&quot; Schneider also stated in his defense that the film was test-screened &quot;all over the country, and I&#x27;ve heard nobody, parents or children, complain about any of the issues. I think, for example, the issue of disabilities is treated with great respect.&quot; and &quot;Quasimodo is really the underdog who becomes the hero; I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything better for anybody&#x27;s psychological feelings than to become the hero of a movie. The only thing we&#x27;ve been asked to be careful about is the word hunchback, which we have to use in the title.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** Nominated Animation Film

== Franchising ==

=== Stage musical ===
The film was adapted into a musical production, re-written and directed by James Lapine and produced by Walt Disney Theatrical, in Berlin, Germany. The musical &quot;Der Glöckner von Notre Dame&quot; (translated in English as &quot;The Bellringer of Notre Dame&quot;) was very successful and played from 1999 to 2002, before closing. A cast recording was also recorded in German. An English-language revival of the musical premiered in San Diego on October 28, 2014.

=== Sequel and spin-offs ===
In June 1998, Disney had announced production had begun on a sequel titled &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame Deux: The Secret of the Bells&quot;, and was slated for release in fall 1999. However, the sequel was delayed from its planned fall release in order to accommodate the recording of &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Love You&quot; by Jennifer Love Hewitt. The sequel reunited its original voice cast, with Hewitt, Haley Joel Osment and Michael McKean voicing new characters. In 2002, the direct-to-video sequel, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot;, was released on VHS and DVD.

Quasimodo, Esmeralda, Victor, Hugo, Laverne and Frollo all made guest appearances on the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. Frollo could also be seen amongst a crowd of Disney Villains in the direct-to-video film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot;.

=== Live-action remake ===
A live-action remake of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; was announced in January 2019. The script was set to be penned by David Henry Hwang with Menken and Schwartz returning to write the music. Josh Gad, David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman were set to produce, with Gad being possibly considered to play Quasimodo. The film, titled &quot;Hunchback&quot;, would draw elements from both the animated film and Hugo&#x27;s novel. In January 2021, Gad stated that the project was still in the works and that he and the studio were &quot;getting closer&quot; to making it happen.

In May 2023, Menken suggested that development on the live-action remake had stalled owing to the original movie&#x27;s content and themes: &quot;It&#x27;s a tough one, because the &quot;Hunchback&quot; movie, &quot;Hunchback&quot; story involves a lot of real, real issues that are important issues and should be explored to be discussed. And there has to be an agreement about how we deal with those issues. You know, do we do a &quot;Hunchback&quot; without &#x27;Hellfire&#x27;? I don&#x27;t think so ... So it sits in this limbo right now.&quot;

=== Video games ===
In 1996, a tie-in game entitled &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame: Topsy Turvy Games&quot; was released by Disney Interactive for the PC and the Nintendo Game Boy, which is a collection of mini games based around the Festival of Fools that includes a variation of Balloon Fight.

In 2022, content of the film was made available within the &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; game by Gameloft, introduced in a limited time Event with a storyline that takes place after the events of the film.

=== Other media ===
Characters from The Hunchback of Notre Dame make very rare appearances at the Disney Parks and Resorts in occasional parades and shows. Clopin&#x27;s Music Box is a small attraction based on the film in Fantasyland at Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland has the Clopin&#x27;s Festival of Foods restaurant.

<text>Edlesborough is a village and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England. Edlesborough is also next to the village of Eaton Bray just over the county boundary in Bedfordshire, about west-south-west of Dunstable.
As well as the village of Edlesborough itself, the civil parish also includes the hamlets of Dagnall, Northall and part of Ringshall. Hudnall was transferred in 1885 to the parish of Little Gaddesden in Hertfordshire.

==Toponym==
The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;Eadwulf&#x27;s barrow&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as &quot;Eddinberge&quot;; records from 1413 list it as &quot;Edlisburgh&quot;; and some postcards found from 1911 are labelled with &quot;Eddlesboro&#x27;&quot; (though this is likely for the purpose of shortening the name for efficiency).

==Parish church==

The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is built on top of a barrow and its high 14th-century bell tower is a local landmark. The church has been redundant since 1975, when the ecclesiastical parish merged with that of Eaton Bray. Today the church is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, and it is normally open to visitors.

The earliest parts of the church date from the 13th century. A chantry was added in 1338 and the tower in 1340. The closeness of these construction dates indicates how rich Edlesborough parish was at the time. Much of the church was altered in the 15th century, including the chantry, which has given the church a very 15th-century character.

Thomas Cobhambury appears as vicar of Edlisburgh in 1413.

On 28 March 1824, the tower was struck by lightning, setting it on fire. The roof&#x27;s lead melted, and the molten lead set fire to everything it struck. Villagers fought the fire, which burned for 12 hours until it was extinguished.

===Furnishings===
The 15th-century rood screen, pulpit with tester and timber roofs are all notable. In the 15th century six misericords were added to the choir stalls. These include carvings of a bat, a dragon and a mermaid. The misericord of the dragon also has some frog carvings for its supporters. There are some notable monumental brasses. The church underwent two major restorations overseen by the architect Robert Jewell Withers in 1867 and 1875. 
In the first restoration, box pews were replaced with pine benches, a gallery was removed from the west, the rood screen was painted, and a large wall painting was added to the nave wall by the Arts and Crafts artist Daniel Bell, depicting Christ enthroned in Majesty. The 1875 restoration of the chancel was funded by a donation from Adelbert Brownlow-Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow of Ashridge.

A more modern addition is a two-light stained glass window on the theme of the Nativity by M. E. Aldrich Rope, also in an Arts and Crafts style.

The Church contains six tuned bells, and one calling bell. It previously had only 5 tuned bells and one calling bell, however, another tuned bell was added after the fire in 1824. Since the Church was decommissioned, the bells no longer ring often, however, they are used during occasional special events.

==Economic and social history==
The Lower Icknield Way, a prehistoric track that runs below the Chiltern Escarpment, runs through the village and aligns with the church mound.

The village was once a centre for the straw plait industry. RAF Edlesborough was a radio station near Dagnall.

The nearby Edlesborough Hill is a low wooded hill beside the River Ouzel just south of the village. For decades it was the site of a Classic trials motor sport event known as the March Hare in which a variety of vehicles tried to climb the hill&#x27;s steep ascent as a test of their capabilities.

==St. Mary&#x27;s Village Carnival==
Annually, on the first Saturday in July, Edlesborough and the surrounding communities put on an annual carnival, held on the Village Green. It features several attractions, starting with a float parade in which several parties compete for a rosette. These parties include the local Scout group and Edlesborough Primary Academy, the village school, as well as other local scout groups and schools from the other villages surrounding Edlesborough. Other attractions include fairground rides, various shops, a classic vehicle display, barbeques and other food stalls, various performances by local performance groups, a dog show, and an owl display.

===Carnival History===
It didn&#x27;t begin on the village&#x27;s Green, as it does today. At first, it was a traditional Church fete, hosted in the Vicarage garden, before being moved to Park Farm in Eaton Bray in 1965. In 1988, it was moved once again to Eaton Bray Recreational Ground, however, the next year, it was moved to the Edlesborough Village Green. It was originally set to alternate between Eaton Bray Recreational Ground and Edlesborough Village Green, however, the former soon became too small to accommodate the growing event, and it now remains in Edlesborough.

===Carnival Themes===
Each year, the carnival chooses a different theme, and that theme is often reflected in the float parade.

===Carnival Trivia===
- Pam Rhodes opened the 1998 Carnival.

- In 2020, during lockdown, instead of a carnival, a scarecrow competition was held, where people made scarecrows and put them on display around the village.

- In 2021, the carnival, while not cancelled, was delayed, instead taking place on the 28th of August.

==Local Myths And Legends==
- A legend says that a tunnel leads from the Church into a former pub, then known as The Bell when it was running. The pub has since been transformed into a private residence.

- While the aforementioned pub &quot;The Bell&quot; was still running, some witnesses claim that after hours, the ghost of a girl with a besom broom could be seen sweeping leaves from the floor by the fireplace. The first report of this sighting claimed that the apparition asked for a better broom.

- Pine Road in the village is said to be the most haunted in the local area, with a ghost known as &quot;The Mulk&quot; said to make regular appearances on nights with a full moon. Residents have reported seeing a tall, ghostly figure accompanied by a brown and white dog running up and down the road.

- It is said that, on dark nights, riding on horseback down the road leading from the Church towards Tring Road, is the ghost of Dick Turpin. He was said to hide in the attic of Butler&#x27;s Manor in Northall, looking out for coaches to come past for him to hold up.

==Amenities==
Edlesborough Primary Academy (Formerly Edlesborough School) is a community primary school. It serves the 4–11 age range and has about 250 pupils. The Academy was founded in 1849. The nearest secondary school is The Cottesloe School in Wing, though students that pass the Eleven-Plus exams can also choose to enrol in one of the three Grammar Schools in the relatively nearby town of Aylesbury, the three Grammar Schools being Aylesbury Grammar School, Aylesbury High School, and Sir Henry Floyd Grammar School.

The village green has two football pitches, one enclosed tennis court and a cricket square. There is a small playing area for children in the green, as well as another in The Grange, which is a residential development further out in the village. There is also a sports pavilion next to the tennis court, which was upgraded in 2021 to include a gym and a café. Nearby, the more central area of the village contains the Edlesborough Post Office and Stores, a corner shop that sells general food supplies and birthday cards, as well as serving as a post office.

==Talk Talk==
The English band Talk Talk filmed a music video for their song &quot;Dum Dum Girl&quot; on their 1984 album &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;. The video was filmed on Sparrow Hill Farm; the parish church can be seen in the background. The video was released on the band&#x27;s 1990 video compilation &quot;Natural History: The Very Best Of Talk Talk&quot;.

<doc id="402874" wikidata="Q1771580" url="?curid=402874" title="River Stour, Dorset">
<text>The River Stour is a river which flows through Wiltshire and Dorset in southern England, and drains into the English Channel. The catchment area for the river and its tributaries is listed as .

==Toponymy==
It is sometimes called the Dorset Stour to distinguish it from other rivers of the same name in Kent, Suffolk and the Midlands. According to Brewer&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Britain &amp; Ireland&quot;, the name Stour rhymes with &quot;hour&quot; and derives from Old English meaning &quot;violent&quot;, &quot;fierce&quot; or the &quot;fierce one&quot;.

== History ==
The river burst its banks at Christchurch during the 2013–14 winter floods and 100 residents were evacuated.

=== Prehistoric archaeology ===
The Stour valley has produced rich evidence for early human (Palaeolithic) activity. Gravel pits in the lower reaches of the river (many underlying modern day Bournemouth) produced hundreds of Lower Palaeolithic handaxes when they were quarried, particular during the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Archaeological investigations around 2010 near Corfe Mullen suggested that some of the artefacts from those quarries may be around 400,000 to 500,000 years old.

==Literary associations==
In Medieval Welsh literature, the river was said to be the site of an important battle and the dividing line between ancient Cornwall and Loegria (England). According to Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, King Locrinus divorces Queen Gwendolen in favour of his secret lover, Estrildis. Returning to her native Cornwall, Gwendolen assembles all the forces of that kingdom against Locrinus. The two armies fight a battle at the river Stour where Locrinus is slain and Gwendolen becomes the ruler of both kingdoms, becoming the first queen regnant of the Kings of the Britons.

The Stour also appears in more occasional fashion in The Faerie Queene.

Thomas Hardy wrote about &quot;Overlooking the River Stour&quot;, while William Barnes similarly referenced the &quot;darksome pools o&#x27; stwoneless Stour&quot; in his &quot;The Water Crowvoot&quot;.

==Course==
The source of the river is fed from greensand springs at Stourhead, in Wiltshire, where it forms a series of artificial lakes which are part of the Stourhead estate owned by the National Trust. It flows south into Dorset through the Blackmore Vale and the towns of Gillingham and Sturminster Newton.

At Marnhull the Stour is joined by the River Cale and then (two miles downstream) by the River Lydden. At Blandford Forum the river breaks through the chalk ridge of the Dorset Downs, and from there flows south east into the heathlands of south east Dorset. At Wimborne Minster it is joined by the River Allen, and at its estuary at Christchurch it is joined by the River Avon before it flows through the harbour into the English Channel.

From source to estuary, the river falls approximately over its length.

For many miles the river is followed by the route of the now disused Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which bridged the river four times in a section between Sturminster Newton and Blandford Forum.

Because much of the river&#x27;s course is across clay soil, the river&#x27;s waterlevel varies greatly. In summer, low water level makes the river a diverse and important habitat, supporting many rare plants. In winter, the river often floods, and is therefore bordered by wide and fertile flood plains.

A number of towns and villages in Dorset are named after the river, including East Stour, West Stour, Stourpaine, Stourton Caundle, Stour Row, Stour Provost, Sturminster Newton, and Sturminster Marshall. Sturminster Newton is famous for its water mill and town bridge, which still bears the notice warning potential vandals that damaging the bridge is punishable by penal transportation.

==Ecology==
The river flows through a myriad of differing settings and scenery (reed bed, open water, coastal, estuarine, river, streams, lowland heath) and as such is host to species such as the pipistrelle bat, harbour porpoise, great crested newt, medicinal leech, Desmoulin&#x27;s whorl snail and the starlet sea anemone.

There are many fish that live and use the river, which include; barbel, bream, chub, dace, grayling, perch, pike, roach, rudd, salmon, tench &amp; trout. The harbour at Christchurch has also been used to land oysters, crab, lobster and cuttlefish, all of which were fished from the harbour itself. Bass and mullet are known to use the estuary for feeding and as a nursery.

Downstream of Blandford Forum, the Stour is host to an insect known as the &quot;Blandford Fly&quot; &quot;(Simulium posticatum)&quot; which is known for leaving painful bites on humans. Attempts have been made to rid the fly from the area with a special spray used on the larval habitats of the fly.

==Recreation and amenity==
The harbour at Christchurch and the lower reaches of the Stour and the Avon are host to a multitude of marinas, boat clubs and landing stages. The Stour is navigable as far upstream as Tuckton (the tidal limit) and whilst there is a low bridge at Iford, it is possible to navigate as far as the rapids which are upstream of Iford Bridge. Spring tides have been known to penetrate a further upstream, as far as Blackwater Bridge (the A338 road). Boats can be hired from several yards and landings in the harbour and estuary area with kayaking and canoeing being popular on the river too.

The Stour Valley Way is a designated long-distance footpath that follows almost all of the course of the river.

White Mill, an 18th-century watermill on the river near Sturminster Marshall, is owned by the National Trust and open to the public.

<text>Fatick is the southwest region of the northern outcrop of Senegal. Its alternative name is Jinnak Bolon. The region is named for its capital city, Fatick.

==History==
The area is rich with Serer ancient and medieval history. Many of the ancient Serer sites are found within this region. It is also one of the holy places in the Serer religion. The Xooy Ceremony (or &quot;Khoy&quot;), a divination festival by the Serer priestly class (the Saltigues) is held within this region once a year. The population is overrun by the Serer people. Historically, it was part of the Serer pre-colonial Kingdom of Sine. In 1859, the Battle of Logandème took place within this region. It was a battle of resistance by the &quot;Siin-Siin&quot; (Serer people of Sine) against French colonialism. It is called in some French scholarly works as the &quot;Battle of Fatick&quot;.

==Departments==
Fatick region is divided into 3 departments :
*Fatick département
*Foundiougne département
*Gossas département

<text>Eaton Bray is a village and civil parish in Bedfordshire, England. It is situated about three miles south-west of the town of Dunstable and is part of a semi-rural area which extends into the parish of Edlesborough. In the 2021 United Kingdom census the population of the parish was recorded as 2,644.

==Toponym==
The toponym &quot;Eaton&quot; is common in England, being derived from the Old English &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;farm by a river&quot;.

==Descent of the manor==

The Domesday Book of 1086 lists the manor as &quot;Eitone&quot;, 
one of the numerous holdings throughout England of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and Earl of Kent, uterine brother of King William the Conqueror. It later escheated to the crown.
In 1205 the manor of Eaton (with many others) was granted to William I de Cantilupe (d.1239), steward of the household to King John (1199–1216), whereupon it became the &quot;caput&quot; of the feudal barony of Eaton. The grant was for knight-service of one knight and was in exchange for the manor of Coxwell in Berkshire, which had been granted to him previously. In 1221 Cantilupe built a castle at Eaton, which is stated in the &quot;Annals of Dunstable&quot; (written by chroniclers at nearby Dunstable Priory), as &quot;a serious danger to Dunstable and the neighbourhood&quot;. The site of the castle, of which the square moat survives, is located approximately 800m to the west of the village and was listed as a scheduled monument in 1958. The 1274 inquisition post mortem of 
Sir George de Cantilupe (1252–1273), Lord of Abergavenny, the builder&#x27;s great-grandson and the last in the male line, records many details concerning the arrangement of Eaton Castle: it was enclosed with a wall and a moat with two drawbridges;
The hall had two chambers, a pantry and a buttery, with tiled roof; within the inner bailey were a great chamber, a foreign chamber, a garderobe, a house for a larder used for a kitchen because there was no kitchen; a drawbridge opened onto the deer park containing woodland of 28 acres; a new chapel and a granary. The outer bailey contained stables for sixty horses, with tiled roofs; a grange, cow houses, pigsties and other thatched buildings; beyond the walls were two gardens, one of three roods the other of one acre. In its final state the deer park covered about 100 acres (40 hectares), enclosed by a banks and ditches, small sections of which survive. Three sides of the square moat survive at Park Farm, open to the public for fishing. The suffix &quot;Bray&quot; was added following the acquisition of the manor by Sir Reginald Bray (d. 1503), in order to distinguish it from numerous other settlements of that name, as was common. The Bray family rebuilt a manor house on the site in the Tudor style. The next owner was the Huxley family. On the death of Sir John Huxley in 1675, the manor house was described as &quot;empty and in a considerable state of disrepair&quot;. A deed dated about 1692 mentions &quot;a manor, now known as &#x27;Eaton Park House&#x27;, surrounded by barns, stables and other outbuildings including a &#x27;stone dovehouse&#x27; and a malthouse&quot;. The house is depicted within the moat on Jeffrey&#x27;s 1765 map of Bedfordshire, but was demolished in 1794. The tithe map of 1849 shows the moated enclosure as pasture called &quot;Park Gardens&quot;, and all standing remains on the site had been razed.

In the 19th century Arthur Macnamara (1831–1906) of Billington, known as &quot;the Mad Squire&quot;, planned to build a mansion on the site of the castle, but ran out of money after completing the lodge at the entrance to Park Farm.

==Church of St Mary the Virgin, Eaton Bray with Edlesborough==

The parish church was built soon after 1205 by William I de Cantilupe using stone from nearby Totternhoe. The organ was refurbished after a local fundraising campaign in the 1980s. The arcades of the nave and the font date from the Early English period. There is a 16th-century communion table.

==Governance==
Eaton Bray is governed by Eaton Bray Parish Council (since 1894) and Central Bedfordshire Council (since 2009). Between 1894 and 1933 the parish formed part of Eaton Bray Rural District. Despite the name the council met in the nearby town of Leighton Buzzard. Eaton Bray Rural District was abolished to become part of Luton Rural District in 1933, which in turn became part of South Bedfordshire in 1974.

==Wallace Nurseries==
Today the site of the former Wallace Nurseries is a housing estate many of the streets within which are named after varieties of plants created by the nursery, for example Saffron Rise and Coral Close.

<doc id="402882" wikidata="Q235432" url="?curid=402882" title="Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark">
<text>Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark (; 11 June 1903 – 16 October 1997) was a Greek princess who married Prince Paul, Regent of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. After her marriage, she was known as Princess Paul of Yugoslavia.

Princess Olga was a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, and a granddaughter of King George I of Greece. After a brief engagement in 1922 to Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, she married Prince Paul of Yugoslavia in 1923. In 1934, after the assassination of King Alexander I, Prince Paul was appointed regent of Yugoslavia on behalf of King Peter II, and Princess Olga became the senior lady of the court and acted as first lady of Yugoslavia, working side by side with her husband on representation duties. In 1941, during the Second World War, Prince Paul was forcibly removed from power after signing the Tripartite Pact, which took Yugoslavia into the Axis with Germany and Italy. Paul, Olga, and their three children were arrested and given as prisoners to the British. They spent the rest of the war in house arrest and exile in Egypt, Kenya and South Africa, and were not allowed to return to Europe until 1948. The couple and their children eventually settled in Paris, where Paul died in 1976. Having become a widow, Olga spent more and more time in the United Kingdom, the adopted country of her sister, Marina. Struck by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the end of her life, Olga died in Paris in 1997. Her remains were buried at the Bois-de-Vaux Cemetery, Lausanne, Switzerland, before being transferred to the royal mausoleum of Oplenac, in Serbia, in 2012.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
==== Childhood ====

A granddaughter of King George I of Greece, Princess Olga was born at Tatoi Palace, the second home of the Greek royal family, in 1903 to Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark (1872–1938) and his wife Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia (1882–1957). As was the Greek tradition, she was then named after her paternal grandmother, Queen Olga.

She grew up alongside her parents and younger sisters, Princesses Elizabeth (1904–1955) and Marina (1906–1968), at the Nicholas Palace, the current seat of the Italian Embassy in Athens. Olga was brought up in relative simplicity and her early education was overseen by an English Norland nurse by the name of Miss Fox.

Once a year, Olga and her family travelled to Russia, where they were regularly received by their Romanov cousins. The princess and her sisters thus had the opportunity to play with the daughters of Tsar Nicholas II, who were roughly the same age as them. They were also in Saint Petersburg, when the First World War broke out in 1914.

==== World War I and exile ====
The First World War marked a difficult period for the Greek royal family. After the fallout between King Constantine I and his prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos over whether Greece should enter the conflict, a virtual civil war shook the Hellenic kingdom, which was partially occupied by the Allies from 1915.

Finally, on 10 June 1917, King Constantine was forced to leave power by the ultimatum of the French High Commissioner Charles Jonnart and he went into exile with his wife and children in German-speaking Switzerland. Described as the &quot;evil genius behind the monarchy&quot; by the Venizelists, Prince Nicolas was quickly forced to leave Athens in turn and join his brother abroad. Olga and her family then settled in St. Moritz, when Greece fell into a financial crisis for the first time during her lifetime.

The restoration of Constantine I in 1920 allowed Olga to return to her native country for a brief period, but the king&#x27;s final abdication in 1922 forced the young princess and her relatives to resume their life in exile. The princess then settled successively in Sanremo, Paris and London, where she lived with members of her family.

==== Broken engagement ====

Considered, along with her sister Marina, to be &quot;one of the most beautiful young women of her time&quot;, Princess Olga had, according to biographer Ricardo Mateos Sainz de Medrano, a &quot;discreet, romantic and fragile personality&quot;.

Prior to her departure into exile, she was linked to the future Frederik IX of Denmark and the engagement of the pair was announced publicly in 1922. However, the awkwardness of the Danish prince, who held the hand of one of Olga&#x27;s sisters instead of hers during the official presentation of the young couple to the Athenian crowd, lastingly humiliated the future bride. Shortly after the event, Olga decided to return her ring to the heir to the Danish throne and called off their engagement.

After moving to the UK, Olga&#x27;s love life was the subject of much speculation. Public rumors and claims circulated about her romantic relationships and she was linked to the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) for some time. Neither Edward nor Olga confirmed the rumors. A frequent guest of the British upper class, the Greek princess met Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, a grandson of Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia, at a ball given by her cousin Lady Zia Wernher.

Immediately impressed by the beauty of Olga, Paul sought to win the favor of the princess, but she was rather indifferent to him. However, other encounters followed, notably at Buckingham Palace, and Prince Paul finally managed to catch her attention.

=== In Yugoslavia ===
==== Marriage and settlement in Yugoslavia ====

Once Olga and Paul&#x27;s engagement was announced on 26 July 1923, the young princess&#x27; trousseau was purchased and prepared in Paris. However, it was in Belgrade, in the prince&#x27;s homeland, that the wedding was organized the following October.

Now Princess of Yugoslavia, Olga set about learning Serbo-Croatian, which she quickly came to master though with a heavy Greek accent. Now dividing her life between the White Palace in Belgrade, a magnificent chalet in the Bohinj valley and a villa on &quot;Rumunska Ulica&quot; (now &quot;Užička Ulica&quot;), Olga benefited from the immense fortune that her husband partly inherited from his maternal family. But, accustomed to a lifestyle less provincial than that which was hers in her new homeland, the princess found her daily life all the more monotonous and boring. Her relationship with King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and his wife were hardly warm.

Olga, however, received regular visits from her sisters and other family members. She gave birth to three children between 1924 and 1936, Prince Alexander (1924–2016), Prince Nikola (1928–1954), and Princess Elizabeth (born 1936), and spent a lot of time caring for them while her husband devoted himself to his art collections.

==== Regency of Paul ====
On 9 October 1934 King Alexander I of Yugoslavia was assassinated during an official visit to Marseille by a Macedonian nationalist member of IMRO. His successor, the young Peter II was eleven years old, and a Council of Regency was set up under the leadership of Prince Paul. Although she had never aspired to a political life, Olga&#x27;s husband had no choice but to accept the responsibility that fell to him and took control of state affairs.

Having become in essence the &quot;first lady&quot; of Yugoslavia, Olga had to more than ever represent her country alongside her husband. With him, she made several official stays abroad and notably met the dictators Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler in Rome and Berlin in April and June 1939, respectively. In the tense context of the late 1930s, the strongly-Anglophile Prince Paul gradually committed his country to a policy of alliance with the Axis powers. It would seem, moreover, that the family ties between Olga and various members of the German upper class who embraced the Nazi ideology (including her cousin, Prince Philip of Hesse) had an effect on the political development of Prince Paul.

In 1938, Olga left Yugoslavia for a long time to look after several elderly relatives. She stayed in Athens to witness the final days of her father, Prince Nicolas, and to take care of her mother, the Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna. A few months later, the princess travelled to Paris, where she reunited with her father-in-law, Prince Arsen of Yugoslavia, who died shortly afterward.

=== Second World War ===

After the outbreak of the Second World War, Prince Paul signed a treaty of alliance on 25 March 1941 and brought his country into the Axis camp. Opposing that decision, the Yugoslav army revolted two days later and proclaimed the majority of young Peter II to assume full power. Paul, Olga and their three children were then arrested and handed over to the British, who deported them to Greece (where they were welcomed by King George II) then to Egypt (under the pretext of intrigue). At the same time, the overthrow of the Yugoslav regency led Hitler to bomb Belgrade and invade the country in April 1941.

Olga and her family were next sent to Kenya, where they arrived after three days of travel, on 28 April 1941. Settled far from Nairobi, in Oserian, in the region of Lake Naivasha, they took up residence in the country house of the late Lord Erroll, where they would be watched by the former governor of the colony. Condemned to inactivity, Olga therefore devoted her days to maintaining the residence, learning to cook and supervising the education of her children, while her husband sank into melancholy and depression. Relatively isolated, the couple nevertheless befriended the families of settlers who resided in the region. In September 1941, they were allowed to move to Preston&#x27;s house, a more modern house located in the same region.

In September 1942, the death of Prince George, Duke of Kent, in an air crash left his wife, Princess Marina, inconsolable and the British government had to allow Olga to stay in the United Kingdom to keep her sister&#x27;s company. Olga took advantage of her stay in Britain to plead her husband&#x27;s cause to the government but without much success. Back in Kenya in January 1943, the princess found her husband severely affected by depression. As Paul&#x27;s condition did not improve, the British government finally allowed Olga&#x27;s family to settle in South Africa in June 1943. There they found several members of the Greek royal family exiled in the dominion after the invasion of their country by the Axis forces. Above all, they ceased to be treated as prisoners, even though they did not officially regain their freedom until 1 June 1946.

Olga and her family were finally allowed to return to Europe in 1948.

=== Later life ===
==== Return to Europe ====
In 1948, Paul, Olga and their three children were finally granted permission to leave South Africa, but Yugoslavia had adopted a communist regime in 1945 and they could not return to their country. The family first settled in Switzerland, then in Paris. Olga also made frequent trips to London and Florence, where Paul owned Villa di Pratolino located not far from Villa Sparta. In Tuscany, Olga had the pleasure of reuniting with her cousin and friend Helen, Queen Mother of Romania, while in the United Kingdom she was always welcomed by her sister Marina, Duchess of Kent, and the rest of the British royal family.

In 1954, Olga and Paul&#x27;s second son, Nikola, was killed in a car accident in England. In 1957, Olga&#x27;s mother Elena Vladimirovna died in Athens.

==== Final years ====
Widowed in 1976, Olga stayed for longer periods in Great Britain. With her sister Marina&#x27;s death in 1968, she was accommodated at Kensington Palace, with Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, and after the latter&#x27;s death, directly at Clarence House with Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Greek princess then acquired the reputation of being a demanding guest.

As she aged, Olga&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. However, she continued to attend the great events of European royalty, such as the weddings of Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia in 1972, her nephew Prince Michael of Kent in 1978, and Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. At the wedding of the Yugoslav pretender, it was also Princess Olga who accompanied him to the altar, as the prince&#x27;s mother and grandmother were not able to attend the ceremony due to health issues.

==== Illness and death ====
Affected by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the end of her life, Princess Olga was hospitalized for a long time in Meudon. A few years before her death, in 1993, her daughter Elizabeth decided to make a documentary film about her with the help of a Serbian journalist Mira Adanja Polak. However, with Olga being heavily affected by the disease, the project of her daughter caused a scandal. Prince Alexander brought a complaint against his sister Elizabeth before the French courts for damage to the image of their mother and claimed, in her name, $107,000 in damages.

Princess Olga died in Paris on 16 October 1997. She was buried alongside her husband in the Bois-de-Vaux Cemetery, in Lausanne, Switzerland.

On 28 September 2012, the remains of Princess Olga, her husband and their son Nikola were exhumed and then transported to Belgrade, Serbia. On 4 October, an official ceremony was held at St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral in Belgrade by Irinej, Serbian Patriarch. The children and grandchildren of the couple, as well as Crown Prince Alexander and his wife Princess Katherine, and Serbian President Tomislav Nikolić and his government participated in the event. Their remains were reburied in the Karađorđević family mausoleum of Oplenac in Topola.

<text>Egypt is a hamlet in the South Bucks district of Buckinghamshire, England. It is located within Farnham Royal civil parish, just to the north of Farnham Common, and on the edge of Burnham Beeches.
It is thought that the hamlet was so named because it was a common settling point for Romani travellers, and the term &quot;gypsy&quot; for such people derives from the Greek (&quot;Aigyptioi&quot;), meaning Egyptian.

<doc id="402888" wikidata="Q2268359" url="?curid=402888" title="Fall Grün (Czechoslovakia)">
<text>was a pre-World War II plan for the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany. Although some preliminary steps were taken to destabilise Czechoslovakia, the plan was never fully realised since Nazi Germany achieved its objective by diplomatic means at the Munich Conference in September 1938, followed by the unopposed military occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and the creation of a nominally independent Slovakia, in March 1939.

==Background==
The plan was first drafted in June 1937, then revised as the military situation and requirements changed - such as after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. Following the May Crisis war scare of that year - when Germany was perceived to have backed down in response to warnings from Czechoslovakia’s allies, France and Britain - the plan acquired a target date scheduling the attack for not later than 1 October 1938. The directive, signed by Adolf Hitler on 30 May 1938, indicated it was his &quot;unalterable decision&quot; to destroy Czechoslovakia in the near future. 

Czechoslovakia&#x27;s principal ally, France, in conjunction with Britain, pursued a policy of &quot;Appeasement&quot; towards Nazi Germany, culminating in the Munich Agreement, signed on 30 September 1938. The agreement, between the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy, transferred the mainly German-inhabited regions of the country (known as the &quot;Sudetenland&quot;) to Germany. The territory concerned contained Czechoslovakia’s strategically significant border fortifications and, as a result of the loss, the plan for a military attack was no longer relevant. The destruction of Czechoslovakia was completed in March 1939, when Slovakia became a nominally independent state under the influence of Nazi Germany. The remaining western parts of Czechoslovakia were occupied by Germany and became the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

The name was later assigned to the plans for an invasion of Ireland.

==Plan of attack==

In addition to specific military assignments, the directive for also focussed on political preparations. The Czechoslovak authorities were to be intimidated by belligerent threats from Nazi Germany and the ethnic German minority population within the country organised to support the military operations. An incident would be staged to provide a pretext for opening hostilities. Attention was also to be given to encouraging Poland and Hungary to pursue their territorial claims against Czechoslovakia. 

The military campaign was to emphasise speed of action and an element of surprise. The aim of the army, in coordination with the air force, was to stage a surprise attack, penetrating and outflanking the border defences adjacent to Germany. The attack was to be carried out by five army formations massed along the western borders of Czechoslovakia. The main thrust of the campaign would come from the west, into Bohemia, in the direction of Plzeň and Prague. Simultaneously, a pincer movement in Moravia, from the north towards Olomouc and the south towards Brno, would prevent the withdrawal of the Czechoslovak army eastwards into Slovakia. Even the Danube flotilla would be brought into action in support of the army. With future armed conflict in mind, the directive also required, wherever possible, for Czechoslovakia’s industrial capacity to be preserved.

==Political pressure==
A significant role in the preparatory stages of the campaign was played by the radicalised section of the ethnic German minority population in Czechoslovakia organised in the Sudeten German Party (SdP), which emulated the characteristics of the Nazi Party in neighbouring Germany. The leader of the party, Konrad Henlein, received instruction from Hitler in Berlin, in March 1938, to create an atmosphere of tension in dealings with the Czechoslovak authorities by making unacceptable demands for major political reforms, but without the intention of reaching a settlement before Germany was ready for military action. As the sense of crisis heightened during the course of the year, Czechoslovakia’s western allies, Britain in particular, applied strong pressure on the president of Czechoslovakia, Edvard Benes, and his government to reach an accommodation with the SdP by conceding to their demands. 

==Undeclared German-Czechoslovak war==
Following a bellicose speech by Hitler in Nuremberg on 12 September 1938, during which he complained of the “intolerable” oppression of Czechoslovakia’s ethnic German population, unrest broke out in the Sudetenland. When Czechoslovak forces intervened and imposed martial law, the SdP leadership fled across the border into Germany. It was from there that Henlein announced, on 17 September 1938, the formation of a paramilitary force, the Sudetendeutsches Freikorps, which, armed and trained in Germany, began conducting cross-border attacks against targets in Czechoslovakia. Although the Munich Agreement, in effect, ended any prospect of immediate Czechoslovak military resistance, Beneš, as president of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile based in Britain during the Second World War, later officially designated 17 September 1938 as the start date of the undeclared war between Germany and Czechoslovakia.

<doc id="402890" wikidata="Q1193924" url="?curid=402890" title="The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)">
<text>The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a 1939 American romantic drama film starring Charles Laughton and Maureen O&#x27;Hara. Directed by William Dieterle and produced by Pandro S. Berman, the film is based on Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1831 novel. The film is also noted for being the first film ever shown at the Cannes Film Festival before the rest of the festival was cancelled due to the start of World War II.

==Plot==
In Paris during the late Middle Ages, Louis XI, the King of France, and his Chief Justice of Paris, Jehan Frollo, visit a printing shop. Frollo is determined to do everything in his power to protect Paris from anything he sees as evil, including the printing press and gypsies. That day is Paris&#x27; annual celebration, the Feast of Fools. Pierre Gringoire, a poor street poet, does a play in front of an audience until it is interrupted by Clopin, the King of the Beggars. Esmeralda, a young gypsy girl, is seen dancing in front of an audience of people. Quasimodo, the deaf hunchback and bell ringer of Notre Dame Cathedral, is crowned the King of Fools until Frollo catches up to him and takes him back to the church.

Esmeralda is caught by a guard and seeks safety in Notre Dame. She prays to the Virgin Mary to help her fellow gypsies only to be confronted by Frollo, who accuses her of being a heathen. Frollo then takes her up to the bell tower where they encounter Quasimodo. As she runs away from the hunchback, Frollo commands Quasimodo to chase after her and kidnap her. Gringoire witnesses all this, and calls out to Captain Phoebus and his guards, who capture Quasimodo just in time and save Esmeralda. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the square and publicly humiliated afterwards. He asks the Parisian townspeople for water, which Esmeralda gives him.

Later that night, Frollo shows up to a party where Esmeralda is performing and confesses his lust for her. Afterwards, Frollo catches her and Phoebus sharing a moment in the garden. Frollo kills Phoebus out of jealousy and sentences Esmeralda to death for the crime, saying that she has &quot;bewitched&quot; him. Just as she is about to be hanged, Quasimodo saves her by taking her to the cathedral and claiming the right of sanctuary.

When Gringoire and Clopin realize that the nobles are planning to revoke Notre Dame&#x27;s right of sanctuary, they both try different methods in order to save Esmeralda from hanging: Gringoire writes a pamphlet, and Clopin leads the beggars to storm the cathedral. At the Palace of Justice, Louis realizes that the pamphlet is creating public opinion, which can influence kings to make decisions. The Archbishop arrives to inform Louis of Notre Dame&#x27;s attack and that Esmeralda is innocent, Louis demands to know who the real murderer is, upon which Frollo confesses his crime and walks away, leaving Louis shocked. Louis orders Olivier to arrest Frollo and then talks to Gringoire after reading his pamphlet. Quasimodo and the guards of Paris fight off Clopin and the beggars. Frollo attempts to kill Quasimodo with a dagger, but Quasimodo stops him and throws Frollo off the cathedral top, sending him down to his death.

Later that morning, King Louis pardons Esmeralda and the other Romani. She leaves the public square with her true love Gringoire and a huge cheering crowd. Quasimodo sees all this from high on the cathedral and asks a gargoyle, &quot;Why was I not made of stone, like thee?&quot;

Irving Thalberg, who was an uncredited producer in the 1923 film, considered remaking the film in 1934 and even discussed the idea with Charles Laughton. Two years later, Universal regained interest in a remake, with a fan poll being instrumental in influencing the studio to make the film. Ronald Colman, Paul Muni, Fredric March, Lionel Barrymore and Peter Lorre were the choices in the poll and in the end, Universal decided to go with Lorre, even as far as negotiating with the actor to star in the film, but the project never materialized.

A year later, Carl Laemmle Jr. persuaded Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to buy the property from Universal as a star-vehicle for Muni. Metro refused and sold the rights to RKO, with Pandro S. Berman producing and William Dieterle directing.

For this production, RKO Radio Pictures built on their movie ranch a massive medieval city of Paris and Notre Dame Cathedral in the San Fernando Valley. This was one of the largest and most extravagant sets ever constructed.

Screenwriter Sonya Levien, who was entrusted to translate Hugo&#x27;s novel into this film, made the story relevant to the events of the time the film was made: she made the obvious parallel between Paris&#x27; persecution of the gypsies and Germany&#x27;s treatment of the Jews prior to World War II.

===Casting===
After hearing the news that RKO was going to remake the 1923 film, Lon Chaney Jr. sought to play the role of Quasimodo and screen-tested for the studio. While the studio felt that Chaney gave excellent performances in his numerous screen tests, other actors would be more suitable for the part, Orson Welles being one of the many considered. Laughton was set to star as Quasimodo, but RKO offered Chaney the role when it seemed that the British actor would be unable to work in America due to troubles with the IRS. Laughton managed to overcome his problems and got the part.

Pleased with her work on Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, Laughton brought a then 18-year old Maureen O&#x27;Hara to Hollywood to play Esmeralda. This marked O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s American screen debut. According to actress Kathryn Adams, she was supposed to play Esmeralda, but lost the role to O&#x27;Hara when Laughton cabled from Ireland to Hollywood that he was &quot;bringing Esmeralda&quot;. Adams played a companion of Fleur as compensation for losing the role.

Dieterle wanted Claude Rains to play Frollo, but before he agreed to play the part, he had an unexpected encounter with Laughton on the Universal lot in which Laughton was very condescending. Rains, who had mentored Laughton and John Gielgud at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, later remarked that their encounter at the lot was the end of their relationship and refused to play the role, which would be played by Cedric Hardwicke.

===Filming===
With a budget of $1.8 million, &quot;Hunchback&quot; proved to be one of the most expensive movies ever made by the studio. It was shot at the RKO Encino Ranch, with the interiors of the bell tower being shot at the Mudd Hall of Philosophy at the University of Southern California.

The sets of Paris and the Notre Dame Cathedral were constructed by Van Nest Polglase at the cost of $250,000 (about $4,974,622 in 2021 dollars), while Darrell Silvera worked as set decorator. Walter Plunkett oversaw the costume design and Joseph H. August served as cinematographer, this film being the first of his three collaborations with Dieterle.

Filming proved to be difficult for the cast and crew due to the hot temperatures, particularly for Laughton, who had to act with a lot of makeup. In her autobiography, O&#x27;Hara recalls one day arriving on the set and finding chimpanzees, baboons and gorillas. Dieterle wanted monks to be on the set but his assistant mistakenly thought he wanted monkeys because of his poor English and thick German accent.

Makeup artist Perc Westmore was loaned by Warner Bros. to RKO for the production. Westmore and Laughton did not get along. Though Westmore wanted to use sponge rubber to make a light appliance for Laughton to wear, Laughton wanted a heavy one to help him stay in character. Laughton was offended when Westmore suggested he try acting as though the hump were heavy and was rude and dismissive to Westmore throughout filming. Near the end of the shoot, Westmore called his younger brother to the studio, where he witnessed Westmore, while strapping on the hump, spray Laughton in the face with a seltzer bottle full of quinine water and then kick him in the posterior. Westmore told Laughton, &quot;That&#x27;s for all the grief you gave me&quot; and added that his brother was a witness and would deny anything Laughton said about the incident.

When Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany on September 1, most of the cast and crew was in a state of fear of what was going to happen. Laughton lightened the mood by reciting the Gettysburg Address (that he had recited in &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot;). Another incident of emotional filming was the filming of the scene where Quasimodo rings the bells in the tower of the cathedral for Esmeralda. Feeling in pain because his native Britain had declared war on Germany, Laughton rang the bells over and over again until he fell down from exhaustion, overwhelming the crew with emotion.

===Censorship===
The characters of Claude Frollo and Jehan Frollo are changed from the novel, as was done in the 1923 film. Such changes were made because the filmmakers were concerned that portraying the priest as a villain would violate the policy of the Hays Production Code. In the novel, Claude is depicted as the villainous 36-year-old Archdeacon of Notre Dame; in the film, he is a good character and much older. His younger brother, Jehan, is a teenage, drunken student, as well as a juvenile delinquent, in the novel; in the film, he is the middle-aged villain who is also Paris&#x27; chief justice and a close advisor to King Louis XI.

==Reception==
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 93% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 8.65/10. &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;super thriller-chiller&quot; but found that the elaborate sets tended to overwhelm the story, particularly in the first half. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Very good! Audiences should be thrilled anew by this lavish remake of Victor Hugo&#x27;s famous novel.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; called it &quot;compelling, dynamic entertainment.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Laughton &quot;achieves something like a tour de force. The lines themselves (such modernisms as &#x27;to buy protection&#x27;), along with a perfunctory plot arrangement, are among the weak features of the film, which otherwise is a vivid pictorial drama of fifteenth-century Paris.&quot; E. H. Harvey of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; said that the film &quot;in all is more than entertaining.&quot; He said that &quot;the mediocre effects offer a forceful contrast to the great moments&quot; in the film. However, Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote a mostly negative review of the film, finding it &quot;little more&quot; than &quot;a freak show&quot;. Though he acknowledged it was &quot;handsome enough of production and its cast is expert,&quot; he called it &quot;almost unrelievedly brutal and without the saving grace of unreality which makes Frankenstein&#x27;s horrors a little comic.&quot;

The movie was very popular, earning $1,549,000 in the United States and Canada and $1,646,000 elsewhere, but because of its cost only made a profit of $100,000.

<doc id="402896" wikidata="Q2117331" url="?curid=402896" title="Rayleigh, Essex">
<text>Rayleigh is a market town and civil parish in the Rochford District in Essex, England; it is located between Chelmsford and Southend-on-Sea, east of central London. It had a population of 32,150 at the census in 2011.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Rayleigh&quot; is Old English in origin deriving from &quot;rǣge&quot; (&#x27;female roe-deer or she-goat&#x27;) and &quot;lēah&quot; (&#x27;clearing&#x27;). Therefore, the name means overall &#x27;wood or clearing of the wild she-goats or roe-deer&quot;.

==History==

===Prehistoric and Roman times===
There has been a scattering of stray finds around the town from Prehistoric and Roman times, including some Roman roof and hypocaust tiles found within the fabric of Rayleigh Church. This suggests that there was a Roman habitation site within the area. However, there is little evidence of any density of population here during this period.

===Saxon era===
One significant archaeological find was in the early 2000s at the western edge of Rayleigh, at the site of the former Park School in Rawreth Lane. An early Saxon cemetery site was discovered here, with 144 cremation burials and evidence of just one high-status female inhumation burial.

By the end of the Saxon period, there was definitely a village here, as it is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was held by Swein of Essex, the son of Robert FitzWimarc.

The most significant historic monument in Rayleigh is the great medieval mound of Rayleigh Castle. This was an early Norman motte and bailey castle, of which only the motte and its surrounding embankments remain. Despite the loss of its timber superstructure and later stone buildings, its height and bulk mean that it still dominates the town centre.

===Later medieval period (1154–1485)===
A courthouse was erected in Rayleigh in 1338. This was apparently resented by the townspeople, who turned out in force to destroy it, with 20 ringleaders later arrested and tried.

The forests around Rayleigh were royal hunting grounds. It is recorded that King Henry III hunted here in 1222, and three King Edwards also visited.

One of the oldest secular buildings in Rayleigh is 91 High Street which houses Pizza Express downstairs and Rayleigh Town Museum upstairs. The Regal Room in the museum is dated circa 1350. It is suspected that some of Rayleigh&#x27;s older brick built buildings may contain portions older than this.

Rayleigh Castle gradually fell into disuse, and in 1394 King Richard II gave permission for the townspeople of Rayleigh to use the foundations as a source of stone. By this time, the site was in royal ownership and used for pasture:
: know all men of special grace who have the will to repair certain Chapel in the said town and to build a new a certain belfry we have granted them the foundations and to take away and use any stones found therein&quot;.

===Tudors and Stuarts===
Records indicate that the church was rich in plate, vestments and stained glass, but these were disposed of:
: &quot;No church within the hundred was more splendidly adorned; none were so richly furnished with plate, vestments and other accessories for the celebration of the divine service; none were so rich in painted glass; none have been more mercilessly despoiled&quot;

During Henry VIII&#x27;s reign, deer were constantly taken from here to replenish the herds in Greenwich Park.

===Modern===

During the 1990s many new housing estates appeared on formerly greenfield areas of the town, with the East of England region currently pushing for even more homes to be built in the area. This has caused some controversy locally, with residents of Rayleigh feeling that the areas surrounding the town should be preserved with more care.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Rayleigh, at parish (town), district and county level: Rayleigh Town Council, Rochford District Council, and Essex County Council.

Rayleigh was an ancient parish. When elected parish and district councils were created in 1894, it was given a parish council and included in the Rochford Rural District. In 1929 Rayleigh and neighbouring Rawreth were removed from the Rochford Rural District and merged to become the Rayleigh Urban District, which was abolished in 1974 when the area became part of the District of Rochford.

The constituency of Rayleigh and Wickford is represented in the House of Commons by the Member of Parliament Mark Francois of the Conservative Party.

Rayleigh Town Council&#x27;s responsibilities include:
*Consultee on Planning applications in Rayleigh.
*Christmas Lights and organisation of switch-on event in Town Centre, King George V Playing Field in Eastwood Road, floral displays in Town Centre and entry to Annual Anglia in Bloom competition, CCTV in Town Centre, benches, salt bins, litter bins, bus shelters, some street lighting, heritage and memorial plaques, and the Town Centre clock.
*Four Allotment sites within Rayleigh with over 100 plots
*Consultee on crime &amp; disorder reduction strategy within Rochford District Member of Rayleigh Windmill management committee.

Rochford District Council&#x27;s civic suite is located on Hockley Road. The Citizens Advice Bureau and Registrar&#x27;s Office are also located here. The Civic Suite is a 19th century mansion house known as &quot;Barringtons&quot; which was converted for municipal use in 1953 and extended in 1964.

==Transport==
Rayleigh railway station is a stop on the Shenfield-Southend line. Greater Anglia operates services between Southend Victoria and London Liverpool Street. Three trains per hour run during the day in each direction; on Sundays, there are typically two trains per hour. 

Bus services are operated predominately by Arriva Southend and First Essex. Arriva&#x27;s services focus on local routes, whereas First Essex services generally travel further afield. Services connect the town with Basildon, Chelmsford, Southend, Rochford, Hockley and Stansted Airport.

==Education==

Rayleigh has two secondary schools: The Sweyne Park School, formed by the amalgamation of the Sweyne and Park schools, and FitzWimarc School. It also has seven primary schools – Down Hall, Edward Francis, Grove Wood, Our Lady of Ransom (Catholic), Rayleigh Primary and Wyburns. The seventh, Glebe Primary School with UHI, was created in September 2014 through the amalgamation
of Glebe Infant and Nursery School and Glebe Junior School. In addition, St Nicholas C of E Primary School, a long-established school for the adjoining village of Rawreth, moved in 2006 to a new building just on the Rayleigh side of the parish boundary.

There are also two cadet units based in Rayleigh - Rayleigh Detachment Essex ACF and 1476 (Rayleigh) Squadron RAFAC.
==Sport and recreation==

Rayleigh has a golf club on the outskirts of the town; Rayleigh Club (previously Lords Golf &amp; Country Club) is situated on Hullbridge Road to the north of the town. This was originally opened in 1991 as &quot;Hanover Golf Club&quot; on the site of Hanover Farm and was designed by Reg Plumbridge.

===Parks/playing fields===

Rayleigh has a number of parks and playing fields.

====King George V playing field====

The playing field is located next to Bull Lane, Hockley Road and Websters Way.

It contains a snack bar and pavilion, as well as a &quot;Teen&quot; shelter

Its two grass football pitches are used by Rayleigh FC, Chronicles FC and Ralee FC. It also has a skate park and a children&#x27;s playground, containing a variety of play equipment. The park is also home to Rayleigh Bowls Club, who lease the use of the pavilion.

Rayleigh Lions holds an annual fireworks display on the playing field.

====Sweyne Park====
Sweyne Park is controlled by Rochford District Council. It is situated north of Sweyne Park School and can be accessed in several ways. The entrance in Downhall Park Way has a small car park and there is a play area. It has another smaller entrance in Downhall Park Way, adjacent to Canterbury Close; it can also be accessed from Victoria Avenue. In 2008, an entrance was established from Priory Chase. The park has a pond. It has a bridleway running round its perimeter of about .

* Fairview Playing Field, Victoria Road TQ814914
* Grove Playing Field, Grove Road TQ825904
* John Fisher Playing Field (Little Wheatleys Chase, Rayleigh) TQ789914

Kingley Wood stands on a steep hill slope beside the A127 and is visible when approaching Rayleigh from London. The small wood is the only surviving ancient wood in Rayleigh, but it has rich and varied wildlife and a well-documented history.

====Wheatley Wood====
This is a broadleaved wood established in the late 1990s.
The wood was designed and planted by a partnership of Local people and the Woodland Trust.
There is a car park at the Grange Community Centre in Little Wheatley Chase and access to the wood is across the playing fields.

===Greyhounds and speedway===
At least two greyhound racing tracks existed in the town. The main venue was the Rayleigh Weir Stadium which also hosted speedway and traded from 1948-1974.

A smaller short lived track at O&#x27;Tooles Meadow, Wickford Road, off the Down Hall Road also hosted greyhound racing and dirt track speedway. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The track opened in 1932, but the date of closure is not known; it is possible that it may have been the same venue known as the Rayleigh Sports Stadium, although it is also possible that the Rayleigh Sports Stadium may have been a third separate venue.

==Public facilities==

There is a small outdoor market on Wednesdays. Until 2011 it was located next to Rayleigh Civic Suite and Information Centre, opposite Holy Trinity Church. In 2011 it moved to the taxi rank in the town&#x27;s High Street (outside Boots).
The market dates back to before 1181 when it was inscribed in the Exchequer Records of Henry II.

The Dutch Cottage, the smallest and oldest council house in the United Kingdom, can be visited on Wednesdays by prior appointment.

Rayleigh Windmill has been renovated, including a structural renovation of the 19th century brick built building has now been completed. The basic external brickwork has been repaired and the interior has been transformed to provide four storeys of modern display facilities which has turned the windmill into a major tourist and educational attraction in the county. The changes to the windmill allow the public to view the interior and to exploit this local historic amenity for cultural, educational and tourism use.

Rayleigh Mount, a National Trust property adjacent to Rayleigh Windmill, is the site of a Domesday castle erected by Sweyn of Essex with distinctive motte-and-bailey defences. Edward Belcham Francis gave the Mount to the National Trust in 1923. From its summit it offers sweeping views across the Crouch Valley.

===Rayleigh Town Museum===
Rayleigh Town Museum occupies the 1st floor at 91 High Street and contains many artefacts telling the history of Rayleigh.

==Religion==

The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity is at the top of the High Street. A church existed on the site in Saxon times and the present building has a Norman chancel. The bell tower was built in the 15th century and includes stone taken from the castle when that fell into disuse. The church has an impressive Tudor brick porch. The Gothic Revival architect C.C. Rolfe restored the chancel in 1873.

The parish church of Saint Michael and All Angels is in Sir Walter Raleigh Drive near Sweyne School. It was built in the 1950s when Rayleigh expanded considerably. It has a multi-purpose building which is used by other local groups as well as the church.

Our Lady of Ransom Catholic Church is on London Hill.

The United Reformed Church is on Crown Hill.

The Baptist Church is in the High Street. The building opened for worship on 25 March 1799, shortly before the first Pastor, Rev James Pilkington, was inducted in June 1799. In June 1979, work started on a church extension. This added significantly more seating and completed some much needed repairs.
The Methodist Church is on Eastwood Road. (Moved from the High Street in 1934).

Grange Free Church is on London Road, at the junction with Langdon Road.

The Salvation Army are located on the corner of the High Street and Love Lane. The building was the original 1884 Methodist Church, which was sold to the Salvation Army in 1934 when the Methodist Church moved to a larger site in Eastwood Road.

<doc id="402899" wikidata="Q2740409" url="?curid=402899" title="Ellesborough">
<text>Ellesborough is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. The village is at the foot of the Chiltern Hills just to the south of the Vale of Aylesbury, from Wendover and from Aylesbury. It lies between Wendover and the village of Little Kimble.

The civil parish includes the hamlets of Butlers Cross, Chalkshire, Dunsmore, North Lee and Terrick, and had a population of 820 at the 2011 Census, an increase from 811 at the 2001 Census.

Close to Ellesborough is the Prime Minister&#x27;s country residence Chequers.

==History==

The village&#x27;s name is probably derived from the Old English for &quot;hill where asses are pastured&quot;. This denotes its importance to the nearby settlements known today as The Kimbles and collectively they comprise a typical Chiltern strip parish with Ellesborough containing valuable hill pasture.

In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Esenberge&quot;. The road from Wendover to Princes Risborough, which makes a very clearly defined detour around the hill on which Ellesborough Church stands, follows the route of the Icknield Way, an ancient trackway used in the neolithic age (3000 to 1800 BC) which ran from Norfolk to Avebury in Wiltshire.
Towering over the village is the dominating Beacon Hill, with its grassy mound and lone tree, iconic amongst the Chiltern Hills when viewed from within the Aylesbury Vale. It is also the site of Cymbeline&#x27;s Mount, also known as Cymbeline&#x27;s Castle, referred to in the Shakespeare play &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. In reality, the name refers to the British King Cunobelinus who, alongside his sons, is said to have battled at this site against the Roman Invasion of the British Isles. It is the site of a medieval motte and bailey castle.

==Parish church==

The Church of England parish church of Saints Peter and Paul stands apart from the village, high on the hill overlooking it. The central part of the building dates from the 15th century, with extensions and restoration between 1854 and 1871. It contains 17th century memorials to Sir Robert Croke MP, his son Robert, and their family.

Prime Ministers have often attended this church for Sunday morning worship when in residence at Chequers. Tony Blair, however, followed his wife and children to their Roman Catholic church in Great Missenden. Margaret Thatcher was famously known to have prayed at Ellesborough church during the Falklands War.

==Notable people==
Lady Isabella Dodd, widow of Sir Samuel Dodd, endowed workhouses in the village in her will in 1722. The Dame Isabella Dodds charity continued until 2004 and gave its name to Dame Isabella Dodds Court in Aylesbury. 

Notable people who live in the village include former Formula One world champion racing driver Sir Jackie Stewart and the actor Sir David Jason.

<text>During World War II, Operation Herbstreise (&quot;Autumn Journey&quot; in German) was a planned series of deception operations to support the German invasion of the United Kingdom (Operation Seelöwe). It would have involved an empty convoy of large transports threatening the east coast of England while the actual invasion force in small barges hit the southern coast.

Two days prior to the actual landings, the light cruisers &quot;Emden&quot; (Kapitän zur See Hans Mirow), &quot;Nürnberg&quot; (Kapitän zur See Leo Kreisch with Vizeadmiral Hubert Schmundt, the Commander of Cruisers, aboard) and &quot;Köln&quot; (Kapitän zur See Ernst Kratzenberg), the gunnery training ship &quot;Bremse&quot; and other light naval forces would escort the liners &quot;Europa&quot;, &quot;Bremen&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Potsdam&quot;, with 11 transport steamers, on Operation &quot;Herbstreise&quot; (Autumn Journey), a feint simulating a landing against the British east coast between Aberdeen and Newcastle. After turning about, the force would attempt the diversion again on the next day if necessary. (Most of the troops allocated to the diversion would actually board the ships, but disembark before the naval force sortied.)

Shortly before the commencement of &quot;Sea Lion&quot;, the heavy cruiser &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; (Kapitän zur See Wilhelm Meisel), on standby at Kiel from 13 September 1940, would carry out a diversionary sortie in the vicinity of Iceland and the Faroes.

The heavy cruiser &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; (Kapitän zur See Theodor Krancke) would carry out another diversionary mission by raiding merchant shipping in the Atlantic. (It is doubtful this ship would have been available in time for the operation as she was undergoing extensive trials and crew training in the Baltic Sea following a major shipyard refit.)

<text>Dunsmore is a name with a separate origin in Scotland and England.

==Scots place name and surname==
Dunsmore is a surname and place name of Scottish origin, predating its first written mention in the Chartulary of the abbey of Lindores in 1198 AD.

The name Dunmore (Dundemor, Dunsmore) was given to a chapel of Lindores Abbey, at Abdie, at least as early as 1198 AD.

This location is presently known as Denmuir.

Dunmuir and Dunmuire also appear in historical records as variants of the name Dundemor, Dunmore or Dunsmore. However, according to Alexander Laing, F.S.A.Scot., 19th century Scots historian of Newburgh and environs, the namings Denmuir and Dunmuir are &quot;erroneous&quot;.

According to known historical documentation the surname Dundemor was first used by one Waldino (Waldin, Waldeve) between 1199-1202 in Medieval Scotland. Waldino de Dundemor is documented as witnessing the gift of Naughton to the Priory of St. Andrews.

Many people were documented as using Dundemor and its variants for their surname. Adopting a place name for a surname was a practice first used on Continental Europe. This practice spread to the UK predominately after 1066 with the Norman Conquest and its Norman-French and Flemish nobility. In Scotland surnames taken from lands became more common after the Davidian Revolution. For example, there are early uses of the name by John de Dundemor and Henry de Dundemor.

Prior to Scottish unification of Picts and Gaels, circa 900 AD, it is believed that the inhabitants of Fife spoke a Brythonic Celtic language. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the origin of the word Dunsmore is Celtic, taken from dun, meaning hill fort and More from Mori, meaning sea.

Variants of the names are often due to the way in which the possessive is spoken in the different languages spoken in Scotland though the centuries: in Gaelic: Dun More or Dun Mor; in French: Dundemore or Dundemor; and in English: Dunsmore or Dunsmor. Additionally, the &#x27;u&#x27; has sometimes been spoken as &#x27;i&#x27; in the process of anglicising the name, yielding Dinsmore.

Further evidence of the origin of the name is attested to by the remains of a Fife hill fort, Dunmore, at position 56° 10&#x27; 15.65&quot; N, 3° 20&#x27; 12.14&quot; W which overlooks the Firth of Forth.

The history of the Dun[s]more family was described in &quot;Lindores Abbey and its burgh of Newburgh: their history and annuals&quot; (1876) by Alexander Laing. Quoting from pages 433–435:

Chapel of Dun[s]more

&quot;Dunsmuir, more correctly Dunmore, [is found] in the parish of Abdie. In the confirmation of the Foundation Charter of Lindores Abbey by Pope Innocent III., A.D. 1198, &#x27;the chapel of Dundemore&#x27; is described &#x27;as belonging to the church of Londors.&#x27; The name is undoubtedly derived from the Gaelic Dun more, the great dun or fort on Norman&#x27;s Law, There is a small chapel on the property, the walls of which are nearly entire, but roofless. It is of comparatively modern creation, but the stones of a much older chapel have been used in its construction and it is a legitimate inference to presume that they formed part of the chapel existing [in] A.D. 1198. Besides hewn work built among the rubble, the lintels of the gable windows are specially noticeable. They consist each of a single stone hewn into a semicircular or arched form, almost identical with some described by Dr. Petrie, as seen in very ancient Irish churches. The engraving of the window in the east gable of the chapel, at page 402, is from a drawing by Mr. Jervise of Brechin. It gives a most accurate representation of the original.

Forfeiture of the Isle of May

&quot;The lands of Dunmore belonged to a family of great antiquity, who took their surname from the name of their property. Henry of Dundemore was a witness to the conveyance of the lands of Rathmuryel to the Monastery of Lundoris Abbey, in the year 1245.

&quot;John of Dundemore was one of the Regents of Alexander III in his minority, 1249-1262.

&quot;In the year 1260, &#x27;a controversy arose between the monks of the Isle of May and Sir John of Dundemore, relative to the lands of Turbrech, in Fife, which, after many altercations, was settled by Sir John relinquishing all claim to the lands; in consideration of which the prior and monks granted him a monk to perform divine service in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Isle of May, for his soul, and the souls of his forefathers and successors. They were also to pay him half a merk of silver yearly, or sixty &#x27;mulivelli&#x27; (a kind of fish abounding in the northern seas—the word has been translated mullet or haddock), as their option; and they also granted to him and his heirs a lamp of glass (to burn continually) in the church of Syreis, or Ceres, and for feeding it two gallons of oil, or twelve pence yearly. If they should fail to observe these conditions, Sir John was to have right of regress to the lands.&#x27;

&quot;Henry of Dundemore, the successor of John, apparently not afraid for the loss of prayers of the monks, seized a horse belonging to them, because they would not swear fealty to him for the lands of Turbrech; but in 1285 the Bishop of St Andrews, as arbiter, decided &#x27;that the monks were not bound to make the fealty claimed, and gave sentence that the horse be restored.&#x27;

The Scottish War of Independence

Edward I of England invaded Scotland in 1296. On 8 August 1296, Edward I ordered the removal of the coronation-stone of the Scottish kings, the scone stone, to Westminster in England. On August 9, he arrived at Lindores, in Fife. On August 28, Edward I ordered, on pain of death, that the Scottish abbots and noblemen swear fealty to him, thus forcing their signature on the Ragman Rolls.

Patrik de Dundemor and Henry de Dundemor are documented as del counte de Fyfe and were forced by Edward I to sign the 1296 Ragman Rolls.

According to eminent historian Alexander Laing, during the Scottish Wars of Independence:

&quot;The Dundemores&#x27; seem to have been a family of great ability, and their talents raised them to high positions both in Church and State. In the struggle for Independence, they adhered to the patriotic side, and suffered in consequence. Among the petitions presented to Edward I for maintenance of wives of those whose estates had been seized because of their opposition to his claims, appears that of Isabella, widow of Simon of Dundemore, 3d September 1296. Her petition was endorsed with these words, Habeat quiete totum—Let her quietly have the whole.

&quot;Sir Richard of Dundemore was taken captive at the Battle of Dunbar in 1296, and imprisoned in Winchester Castle, where he was confined for at least two years. On the 30 September 1298, an order allowing him fourpence a day for his maintenance while in prison, is preserved among the English Public Records.

&quot;Thomas of Dundemore, Bishop of Ross, recognised the title of King Robert Bruce to the Crown of Scotland, AD 1309. In the same year, John of Dundemore affixed his seal as a witness to the settlement of the dispute between the Abbot and Convent of Lundoris and the Burgesses of Newburgh.

&quot;Stephen of Dundemore, who is expressly mentioned as being descended from the Dundemores of that ilk in Fife, was elected Bishop of Glasgow AD 1317. The Bishop-elect being a keen supporter of Bruce, Edward II wrote to the Pope not to admit him to the Bishopric; and it would appear that he never was consecrated, having died, it is said, on his way to Rome.

&quot;On the 27 June 1321, Sir John Dundemore conveyed by charter in free gift to the monks of Balmerino, the right to the water running through his land of Dunberauch for the use of their mill at Pigornoch. The bestowal of this gift was apparently made at the occasion of a festive gathering at Dunmore; The Bishop of St Andrews [Bishop William de Lamberton], the Abbot of Lundoris, Sir David de Berkeley (of Cullairnie), Sir Alexander Seton (Governor of Berwick), Alex of Claphain, and others, were present as witnesses; most of whom had borne their part in the great struggle for Independence.&quot;

Forfeiture of Lands

In addition to these forfeitures to the Church, the remaining lands of ancient Dunmores &quot;seems to have come into the hands of the crown&quot; in the 15th century. In 1507 James IV gave the lands of Nether Dunmure to Andrew Aytoun, Captain of Stirling Castle.

Emigration

Many Dinsmores, Dunmores, Dunsmuirs, and Dunsmores emigrated from Fife in the seventeenth century to the Americas, and to Ulster and Donegal in Northern Ireland. Many of these Dunsmores subsequently emigrated to Canada, the United States and Australia.

==As an English place name==

Dunsmore is the name of several places in England. The place name is Old English in origin, taken from personal name Dunn + mor and means &quot;Dunna&#x27;s moor&quot;.

Places called Dunsmore include:

*Dunsmore, Buckinghamshire
*Dunsmore, Devon
*Dunsmore, Warwickshire
**Bourton-on-Dunsmore
**Clifton-upon-Dunsmore
**Dunsmore Farm
**Dunsmore Heath
**Ryton-on-Dunsmore
**Stretton-on-Dunsmore
*Dunsmore Green, Forthampton, Gloucestershire

Clifton upon Dunsmore is not referred to as such until 1306 AD. Prior references list it simply as &quot;Cliptone&quot; in 1086 AD and &quot;Cliftun ultra Tamedan&quot; in 934 AD.

Ryton-on-Dunsmore is referred to as &quot;Ruiton&quot; in 1209 AD, &quot;Riton&quot; in 1150 AD and &quot;Rieton&quot; in 1086 AD. There is no clear date for the time at which Dunsmore was added to the name, although it is suggested that Dunsmore came into use in the 12th century.

Dunsmore in Warwickshire is also the source of the title Baron Dunsmore granted to Francis Leigh, 1st Earl of Chichester in 1628.

<doc id="402909" wikidata="Q837593" url="?curid=402909" title="Futon">
<text>A is a traditional Japanese style of bedding.

A complete futon set consists of a and a . Both elements of a futon bedding set are pliable enough to be folded and stored away in a large during the day. This allows a room to serve as a bedroom at night, but serve other purposes during the day.

Traditionally, futons are used on tatami, a type of mat used as a flooring material. It also provides a softer base than wooden or stone floors. Futons must be aired regularly to prevent mold from developing, and to keep the futon free of mites. Throughout Japan, futons can commonly be seen hanging over balconies, airing in the sun. Futon dryers may be used by those unable to hang out their futon.

==History and materials==
Before recycled cotton cloth was widely available in Japan, commoners used , stitched crinkled paper stuffed with fibers from beaten dry straw, cattails, or silk waste, on straw floor mats. Later, futons were made with patchwork recycled cotton, quilted together and filled with bast fiber. Later they were filled with cotton. Wool and synthetics are now also used.

 (よぎ, literally &quot;nightclothes&quot;) are kimono-shaped bedclothes. They were used in the 1800s and early 1900s. Rectangular s are now widely used. s vary in materials; some are warmer than others. Those with traditional cotton filling feel heavier than those with feather or synthetic fillings.

Traditional (まくら) are generally firmer than western pillows. They may be filled with beans, buckwheat chaff, bran, or, modernly, plastic beads, all of which mold to the head. Historically, some women used wooden headrests to protect their hairstyles.

==Dimensions==
Futons are traditionally laid on tatami rush mats, which are resilient and can absorb and re-release up to half a liter of moisture each. Tatamis measure 1 by 0.5 ken, just under 1 by 2 meters, the same size as a Western twin bed. A traditional is also about the size of a Western twin bed. , double-bed-sized s were available, but they can be a bit heavy and awkward to stow.

The is usually thick, and rarely as much as thick; they need to dry well, or they will become heavy and mouldy. A is thus about as thick as a Western mattress topper. If more thickness is needed, s are layered.

s may be wider than s, and they vary in thickness. Depending on the weather, they may be layered with a warm , or replaced with a lighter .

The traditional is usually smaller than a western pillow.


==Western-style futons==
In the 1980s, futons became fashionable in North America. The construction method was similar to that of contemporary Japanese futons: cotton batting, covered in cotton ticking and held in place with hand-sewn tufting (through-thickness stitches). This was also the structure that had been used in the United States&#x27; 1940-1941 Cotton Mattress Program, designed to use excess cotton production by subsidizing materials for people to make their own cotton mattresses.

However, Western-style futons, which typically resemble low, wooden sofa beds, differ considerably from their Japanese counterparts. They often have the dimensions of standard western mattresses, and are too thick to fold double and stow easily in a cupboard. They are often set up and stored on a slatted frame, which avoids having to move them to air regularly, especially in the dry indoor air of a centrally-heated house (most Japanese homes were not traditionally centrally-heated).

==Futon-like traditional European beds==

Traditional European beds resembled Japanese-style futon sets, with thin tick mattresses. These were only sometimes set on a bedframe. The term &quot;bed&quot; did not originally include the bedframe, but only the bedding, the same components included in a Japanese futon set.

It was also traditional to air these beds, and duvets are still aired in the window in Europe. In English-speaking cultures, however, airing bedding outdoors came to be seen as a foreign practice, with 19th-century housekeeping manuals giving methods of airing beds inside, and disparaging airing them in the window as &quot;German-style&quot;.

<text>The mappiq ( &quot;mapík&quot;; also &quot;mapiq&quot;, &quot;mapik&quot;, &quot;mappik&quot;, lit. &quot;causing to go out&quot;) is a diacritic used in the Hebrew alphabet. It is part of the Masoretes&#x27; system of niqqud (vowel points), and was added to Hebrew orthography at the same time. It takes the form of a dot in the middle of a letter (usually , &quot;he&quot;). An identical point with a different phonetic function (marking different consonants) is called a dagesh.

The &quot;mappiq&quot; is used to indicate that the corresponding letter is to be pronounced as a consonant, although in a position where the letter usually indicates a vowel. Typically, the mappiq is used in the middle of (&quot;he&quot;), though it historically and biblically has been used with (yodh), (vav), and (aleph).

Before the vowel points were invented, some consonants were used to indicate vowel sounds. These consonants are called &quot;matres lectionis&quot; (New Latin: sg. &quot;māter lēctiōnis&quot; &quot;mother of reading&quot;, pl. &quot;mātrēs lēctiōnis&quot; &quot;mothers of reading&quot;, calques of Hebrew: &quot;em kriá&quot; and &quot;imót kriá&quot; - with the same meaning). The letter &quot;he&quot; (transliterated &quot;H&quot;) at the end of a word (Hebrew is written from right to left) can indicate the vowel sound &quot;a&quot; or &quot;e&quot;. When it does, it is not acting as a consonant, and therefore in pure phonetic logic the Biblical name Zechariah (among others) should be spelled &quot;Zekharya&quot; without the final &quot;h&quot;. However, silent final h being also a feature of English, it is usually retained in Hebrew transliterations to distinguish final &quot;he&quot; from final &quot;aleph&quot;.

The divine name Yah has a mappiq (a dot inside the last letter), so the last letter shall not be read as a vowel &quot;a&quot;, but as the consonant &quot;H&quot; - and therefore Yah (and not Ya).

The most common occurrence of &quot;mappiq&quot; is in the suffix &quot;-ah&quot;, meaning &quot;her&quot;.

A &quot;he&quot; with &quot;mappiq&quot; is meant to be pronounced as a full consonant &quot;h&quot;. In Mizrahi and Yemenite Hebrew it is pronounced more strongly than a normal &quot;he&quot;, sometimes with a slight following &quot;shwa&quot; sound (this rule is also followed by Dutch Sephardim), and in Ashkenazi Hebrew, it is pronounced . In modern Hebrew, however, it is normally silent; although it is still pronounced in religious contexts by careful readers of the prayers and scriptures.

== Rafe ==

In Masoretic manuscripts the opposite of a &quot;mappiq&quot; would be indicated by a &quot;rafe&quot;, a small line on top of the letter. This is no longer found in Hebrew.

<text>Ollerton is a town and former civil parish, now in the parish of Ollerton and Boughton, in the Newark and Sherwood district, in the county of Nottinghamshire, England, on the edge of Sherwood Forest in the area known as the Dukeries. The population of Ollerton and Boughton at the 2011 census was 9,840.

The area is sometimes differentiated locally using the names New Ollerton for the post-1900 expansion, compared with Old Ollerton referring to the original village clustered around the church, river and mill.

== History ==
=== Before coal ===
Ollerton is a settlement listed in Domesday Book, located in the Bassetlaw Wapentake or hundred in the county of Nottinghamshire at a crossing of the River Maun. In 1086 it had a recorded population of 15 households, and is listed in the Domesday Book under two owners.

Formerly a rural village with a tradition of hop-growing centred on the parish church of St Giles, the settlement has its origins at a point where three main routes crossed. The A614 linking Nottingham north through Sherwood Forest to Blyth, Nottinghamshire and on to Doncaster; the A6075 linking Mansfield with the ferry crossing of the River Trent at Dunham-on-Trent and on via the A57 road to the cathedral city of Lincoln, England; and the A616 linking Sheffield with the Great North Road Great Britain at Newark-on-Trent.

Ollerton was an ancient parish, and became a civil parish in 1866. The civil parish was abolished on 1 November 1996 and merged with the parish of Boughton to form the new civil parish of Ollerton and Boughton. In 1961 the parish had a population of 5529.

=== The coal years ===
From the 1920s onwards the main industry was coal mining with Ollerton expanding greatly during the 1960s and 1970s, having the name New Ollerton. 

The colliery was sunk in the 1920s and completed during the General Strike of 1926, which led to a saying of &quot;Ollerton was ever built with scab labour&quot;.

The coal mine was established and funded by the Butterley Company, having an historic base of coal and iron ore mining in nearby Derbyshire; they created a model village in Ollerton for the colliery higher management and workers. A hosiery factory was established in 1937 to provide work for the miners&#x27; wives.

During the expansion of the pit, many miners from closed collieries in north-eastern England and Scotland moved to work at Ollerton. There was a large Polish community amongst the miners at Ollerton, estimated to make up roughly half the workforce at the time of the 1984-1985 strike.

Ollerton Colliery was considered one of the most left-wing pits in Nottinghamshire, and was subject to heavy picketing at the time of the ballot by the Nottinghamshire branch of the National Union of Mineworkers in March 1984. A miner from Ackton Hall Colliery, near Featherstone, West Yorkshire died at Ollerton when picketing during the miners&#x27; strike on 15 April 1984. David Gareth Jones was hit in the neck by a brick thrown by a local youth when he was picketing, but the post-mortem ruled that it had not caused his death and that it was more likely to have been caused by being pressed against the pit gates earlier in the day. News of his death led to hundreds of pickets staying in Ollerton town centre overnight. At the request of Nottinghamshire Police, Arthur Scargill appeared and called for calm in the wake of the tragedy. However, several working miners in Ollerton reported that their gardens and cars had been vandalised during the night. A memorial bench was sited near the spot where David died. As a mark of respect for Jones, Ollerton Colliery closed for a few days afterwards.

=== After coal ===
The mine closed in 1994, losing around 1,000 jobs. A group of locals including past colliery workers had a vision to try to establish a new facility that would – at least – provide as many new jobs as were lost. A non-profit organisation run by 10 trustees was established to raise &quot;...just under £50,000&quot; to purchase the 125-acre colliery footprint from British Coal.

A further £4.25 million was needed to reclaim and clean up the land, which was redeveloped as an ecologically sustainable business park of commercial offices occupying 40-acres, named &quot;Sherwood Energy Village&quot;. 

Key-tenants, including Center Parcs and Nottinghamshire County Council, were responsible for creating their own buildings, with an emphasis on low-energy consumption by using advanced materials and technology including ground source heat pumps. Included into the layout was a nearby Tesco superstore.

The original development organisation failed in 2010 and went into administration, citing difficult trading conditions after the worldwide 2007–2008 financial crisis, having created 500 more jobs than the original 1,000 target, and having been awarded the inaugural &quot;Enterprising Britain Award&quot; in 2005. 

== Landmarks ==
In the old part of the original village, Ollerton Watermill was built in 1713 on the River Maun. It operated commercially producing flour until 1984. Restored in 1993, it now houses a teashop and exhibition. Ollerton Town has a local football team, Ollerton Town F.C.

== Public transport ==
Ollerton is served by Stagecoach Mansfield, Travel Wright. Stagecoach Bassetlaw run the Sherwood Arrow between Worksop/Retford-Ollerton-Nottingham every 60 minutes.

Ollerton was served by a station on the Shirebrook to Lincoln line. The line is in use for track testing between Dukeries Junction and Shirebrook, but the through route to Lincoln closed in 1980. There has been some ambition to reinstate passenger train services to the town by using the current test-track route from Shirebrook on the Robin Hood Line to a terminus at Ollerton, with potential stations at Warsop and Edwinstowe.

== Ollerton roundabout ==

Ollerton roundabout on the main A614 road is a five-way junction linking to Ollerton and surrounding areas. Despite a small measure of improvement in 2010 to try to create better traffic flow by white-line marking a separate left-turn lane when joining the A614 from the A616 exiting Ollerton, Ollerton roundabout is considered a major long-term traffic bottleneck, with highways project-ambitions for major expansion necessitating compulsory purchase land-acquisition.

Speaking in October 2024 after the budget, Conservative politician Ben Bradley, then-leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, stated an anticipated £26 million roads plan to include Ollerton was uncertain after the change of government to Labour following the July 2024 general election. In August 2024, Bradley had queried government commitment after then-transport secretary Louise Haigh in July 2024 announced a wide-ranging Transport Infrastructure Review. Haigh resigned in late 2024.

The failure to progress highway improvements was stated to be running at an additional £2 million per year, and also is a significant planning restriction for limiting the amount of new-build housing intended for the nearby brownfield regeneration site of the former Thoresby Colliery.

== Media ==
Ollerton receives its television signals from various transmitters: Waltham, Emley Moor, and Belmont TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Nottingham, Capital East Midlands, Smooth East Midlands, and Bowe Radio, a community based radio station. 

The &#x27;Roundabout&#x27; is a community led newspaper that delivers free to all households in Ollerton &amp; Boughton. 

== Notable residents ==
Ollerton is the birthplace of Tim Flear OBE, MVO, former career diplomat and HM Consul-General in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 2006–10 and Milan, Italy 2014–19.

== Trivia ==
Ollerton features in a related song by Australian singer Darren Hayes entitled &quot;A Hundred Challenging Things A Boy Can Do&quot; on his 2007 album &quot;This Delicate Thing We&#x27;ve Made&quot;.

<doc id="402923" wikidata="Q1049049" url="?curid=402923" title="Bottled water">
<text>Bottled water is drinking water (e.g., well water, distilled water, reverse osmosis water, mineral water, or spring water) packaged in plastic or glass water bottles. Bottled water may be carbonated or not, with packaging sizes ranging from small single serving bottles to large carboys for water coolers. The consumption of bottled water is influenced by factors such as convenience, taste, perceived safety, and concerns over the quality of municipal tap water. Concerns about the environmental impact of bottled water, including the production and disposal of plastic bottles, have led to calls for more sustainable practices in the industry.

==History==
Although vessels to bottle and transport water were part of the earliest human civilizations, bottling water began in the United Kingdom with the first water bottling at the Holy Well in 1622. The demand for bottled water was fueled in large part by the resurgence in spa-going and water therapy among Europeans and American colonists in the 17th and 18th centuries. &#x27;Bristol Water&#x27; taken from the spa at Hotwells was one of the first drinking waters to be bottled and marketed widely. Daniel Defoe noted in 1724 that there were over 15 glasshouses in Bristol, &quot;which are more than in London...and vast numbers of bottles are used for sending the water of the Hotwell not only over England but all over the world.&quot;
The first commercially distributed water in America was bottled and sold by Jackson&#x27;s Spa in Boston in 1767. Early drinkers of bottled spa waters believed that the water at these mineral springs had therapeutic properties and that bathing in or drinking the water could help treat many common ailments.

The popularity of bottled mineral waters quickly led to a market for imitation products. Carbonated waters developed to reproduce the natural effervescence of spring-bottled water, and in 1809 Joseph Hawkins was issued the first U.S. patent for &quot;imitation&quot; mineral water. Technological innovation in the 19th century led to cheaper glass and quicker bottling. So bottled water could be produced on a larger scale and grew in popularity. Many saw bottled water as safer than municipal water supplies, which could spread diseases such as cholera and typhoid. By around 1850, one of America&#x27;s most popular bottlers, Saratoga Springs, was producing more than 7 million bottles of water annually.

In the United States, the popularity of bottled water declined in the early 20th century, when the advent of water chlorination reduced public concerns about water-borne diseases in municipal water supplies. But it remained popular in Europe, where it spread to cafés and grocery stores in the second half of the century. Perrier water had been bottled since the 19th century and widely sold throughout the British Empire; in 1977 Perrier launched in the United States. Today, bottled water is the most popular commercial beverage in the United States, with about 25% of the consumption share versus 18.7% for soft drinks.

===Water chemistry===
Many of the early developments in the field of chemistry can be attributed to the study of natural mineral waters and attempts to replicate them for commercial sale. Joseph Priestley, who discovered oxygen in 1775, made his first contributions to the field of chemistry by dissolving carbon dioxide in water, for which he was awarded the Copley Medal in 1773. He later worked with Johann Jacob Schweppe, founder of Schweppes, in developing &quot;aerated&quot; waters for commercial sale.

===PET plastic bottles===

In 1973, DuPont engineer Nathaniel Wyeth patented Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, the first plastic bottle to withstand the pressure of carbonated liquids. Today, PET plastic has replaced glass as the preferred material for single-serving bottled water containers due to its light weight and resistance to breaking.
 The mere fact of lightweight single-use packaging and one-way shipping caused the revolution in water marketing that by the late 1990&#x27;s had spread from the U.S. and Europe to around the world.

==Types==
Some of the more common types of bottled water are:
* Alkaline water – this type of water has increased pH levels produced through electrolysis 
* Artesian water – this is water that originates from a confined aquifer that has been tapped and in which the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer and flows naturally to the surface. This water is at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure, so it flows naturally from the surface or pipe.
* Fluoridated – this type of water contains added fluoride. This category includes water classified as &quot;For Infants&quot; or &quot;Nursery.&quot;
* Groundwater – this type of water is from an underground source such as a well. This can include Artesian water sources.
* Mineral water – water from a mineral spring that contains various minerals, such as salts and sulfur compounds. It comes from a source tapped at one or more bore holes or spring, and originates from a geologically and physically protected underground water source. No minerals may be added to this water.
* Purified water – this type of water has been produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other suitable processes. Purified water may also be referred to as &quot;demineralized water&quot;.
* Sparkling water – Sparkling water contains the same amount of carbon dioxide that it had at emergence from the source. The carbon dioxide may be removed and replenished after treatment.
* Spring water – this type of water comes from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the Earth&#x27;s surface.
* Sterile water – this type of water meets sterilization requirements, for example, those specified under &quot;sterility tests&quot; in the United States Pharmacopoeia.
* Well water – well water is taken from a hole tapping, etc. This hole may be bored, drilled, or otherwise constructed in the ground.

==Product forms==
The Beverage Marketing Corporation defines the bottled water market segment as &quot;retail PET, retail bulk, home and office delivery, vending, domestic sparkling and imports&quot;, but excluding &quot;flavored and enhanced water.&quot;

===Purified water vending machines===

A number of cities and companies worldwide have vending machines that dispense purified water into customers&#x27; own containers. All dispensers filter the location&#x27;s tap water. In North America, these machines are typically located outside of supermarkets.

===Bottled water service===
It is not uncommon for businesses or individuals to subscribe to a bottled water service. These services deliver water either monthly or weekly, sometimes even daily. Traditionally, water in glass bottles (jugs) was provided to electric coolers in areas of businesses without plumbing. Plastic containers have replaced those glass jugs, however, dispensers at businesses now may stand alongside existing water taps or fountains.

===Storage===
Bottled water is often stored as part of an emergency kit in case of natural disaster. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) says the &quot;safest&quot; and &quot;most reliable&quot; source of drinking water is store-bought bottled water. Commonly, disaster management experts recommend storing of water per person, per day for at least three days. This amount is intended to include water for drinking and cooking as well as water for hand washing, washing dishes, and personal hygiene. Factory containers of water have an indefinite shelf life, as long as they remain unopened and undamaged. The sell-by date is voluntarily and individually set by manufacturers to indicate the length of time that they believe the water will taste and smell fresh, rather than to indicate any issue of contamination or food safety.

==PET recycling==
The most common packaging material for single-serve, non-carbonated bottled water in the United States and Europe is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. Marked in many countries with resin identification code number &quot;1&quot;, PET is 100% recyclable, though recycling rates vary by region. In 2014, approximately 1.8 billion pounds of post-consumer PET bottles were collected in the United States and 1.75 million metric tons (approximately 3.9 billion pounds) were collected in the European Union, making it the most recycled plastic in both the United States and Europe. In the United States, the recycling rate for PET packaging was 32% in 2014; in the European Union, the recycling rate for PET packaging for the same period was approximately 52%.

The National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR), the trade association for the PET plastic packaging industry in the United States and Canada, identifies five major, generic end-use categories for recycled PET plastic:

# Packaging applications, including new bottles.
# Sheet and film applications, including some thermoforming applications.
# Strapping.
# Engineered resins applications.
# Fiber applications.

In Europe, more than one-third of recovered PET plastic is used to produce polyester fibers, and another quarter is used in the production of preformed plastic containers—such as egg cartons, fruit boxes, and other plastic beverage bottles.

==Water and energy usage==

On average, it takes 1.32 litres (L) of water to produce 1 L of bottled water. This includes 1 L of ingredient water and 0.32 L of water used in facility processes such as treatment, bottling, and maintenance. Small pack facilities (facilities that package water in containers between 8 oz. and 2.5 gallons) use the least amount of water (1.26 L per 1 L), followed by mixed packaging facilities (1.46 L per 1 L). Facilities that package water for home and office delivery in sizes of 2.5 gallons to 5 gallons use the most water (1.56 L per 1 L).

Bottled water has lower water usage than bottled soft drinks, which average 2.02 L per 1 L, as well as beer (4 L per 1 L) and wine (4.74 L per 1 L). The larger per-litre water consumption of these drinks can be attributed to additional ingredients and production processes, such as flavor mixing and carbonization for soft drinks and fermentation for beer and wine. In the United States, bottled water production represents 0.011% of annual water consumption.

Critics of bottled water argue that the industry should take in to account not just water used in its production and packaging process, but the total water footprint of its supply chain, which includes water used in the production of its packaging.

A 2011 IBWA lifecycle inventory study found that the production, packaging, and transportation of bottled water within the United States consumes of energy annually, which represents about 0.07% of yearly energy consumption in the country. According to the same study, 6.8 million tons of equivalent are emitted by the bottled water industry a year in the United States, about 0.08% of annual emissions. An Aetna Group study in 2015 concluded that each litre of bottled water requires 240 kilojoules of energy to produce. The lifecycle carbon footprint for a half litre of small pack bottled water is 111 grams equivalent. By comparison, the same sized PET plastic-bottled soft drink produces 240 grams equivalent. Soft drink bottles require much thicker plastic due to carbonation, and therefore many more grams of equivalent.

==Regulation==
===Bureau of Indian Standards – India===

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the national standards body of India working under the aegis of Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food &amp; Public Distribution, Government of India. It is established by the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1986 which came into effect on 23 December 1986. The minister in charge of the ministry or department having administrative control of the BIS is the ex-officio president of the BIS.

===Food and Drug Administration – US===
Bottled water is comprehensively regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a packaged food product. By law, the FDA regulations for bottled water must be at least as stringent as the Environmental Protection Agency standards for tap water.

The FDA has established &quot;Standards of Identity&quot; for bottled water products sold in the U.S. For a product to be considered &quot;bottled water&quot;, it cannot contain sweeteners or chemical additives (other than flavors, extracts or essences) and must be calorie-free and sugar-free. If flavors, extracts and essences—derived from spice or fruit—are added to the water, these additions must comprise less than 1% by weight of the final product. The FDA Code of Federal Regulations establishes limitations for the amount of fluoride that can be added to water. Mineral water contains at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids (TDS). &quot;Purified water&quot; is defined in the United States Pharmacopoeia.

===Food Standards Code – Australia &amp; New Zealand===
Food Standards Australia New Zealand&#x27;s Food Standards Code limits fluoride in bottled water to between 0.6 and 1.0 milligrams per litre, and requires any addition to be specified on the product label.

===Industry reform – Canada===
The Council of Canadians, a social action organization, stressed the need for bottled water industry reform after launching a boycott of Nestlé in September 2016 after the company outbid a small town aiming to secure a long-term water supply through a local well as the country battles drought and depletion of ground water reserves. Premier Kathleen Wynne stated that her government will look for ways to put community needs ahead of bottled water corporations, saying &quot;as we look at the water bottling industry, that has to be a question because we&#x27;re talking about what we could argue is our most precious resource&quot; that they have this &quot;discussion about our water, the status of and the treatment of water bottling companies, that needs to be taken into consideration&quot;.

==Markets==
===Global sales===
Global bottled water consumption crossed the 3 billion hectoliter threshold in 2014. In 2017, the global rate of consumption rose by an estimated 7.6 percent. Per capita consumption was 50.1 liters, up by 3 liters from 2016&#x27;s 47.1 liters.

===Australia===
The Australasian Bottled Water Institute is a regional member of the International Council of Bottled Water Associations. The bottled water industry in Australia is worth approximately $400 million per year,

An upmarket restaurant in Sydney has stopped selling bottled water and started using a machine costing A$5000 to filter, chill and carbonate tap water to get the same quality water.

Despite ongoing water restrictions, an application to extract groundwater for bottled water was approved in 2020.

===European Union===

Directive 2009–54/EC deals with the marketing and exploitation of natural mineral waters in the European Union. The two main types of bottled water recognized are mineral water and spring water.

Broadly speaking, &quot;mineral water&quot; is groundwater that has emerged from the ground and flowed over rock. Treatment of mineral water is restricted to removal of unstable elements such as iron and sulfur compounds. Treatment for such minerals may extend only to filtration or decanting with oxygenation. Free carbon dioxide may be removed only by physical methods, and the regulations for introduction (or reintroduction) of CO2 are strictly defined. Disinfection of natural mineral water is completely prohibited, including the addition of any element that is likely to change bacterial colony counts. If natural mineral water is effervescent, it must be labelled accordingly, depending on the origin of the carbon dioxide: naturally carbonated natural mineral water (no introduction of CO2); natural mineral water fortified with gas from the spring (reintroduction of CO2); carbonated natural mineral water (CO2 added following strict guidelines).

Directive 2001–83/EC deals with bottled water that is considered a &quot;medicinal product&quot; and is thus excluded from the scope of the other regulation.

===India===
The bottled water industry in India witnessed a boom in the late 1990s soon after Bisleri launched its packaged drinking water in the country. This significant growth was fuelled by a surge in advertising by the industry players that &quot;bottled water was pure and healthy&quot;.

The total market was valued at in 2013, of which the top five players (Bisleri, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Parle) accounted for 67% of the market share. This market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22%, to reach in 2018.

In 2016, the state of Sikkim announced restrictions on the usage of plastic water bottles (in government functions and meetings) and styrofoam products as it is associated with adverse health and environment impacts.

===Lebanon===
Lebanon has one of the fastest growth rate of per capita consumption of bottled water. Lebanon has seven major brands of bottled mineral water for local consumption and for exportation to the water-starved countries on the Arabian Peninsula and in the Persian Gulf.

===New Zealand===
Bottled water in New Zealand is regulated by Food Standards Australia New Zealand and must comply with the Food Act 1981. From July 2009 fluoride was allowed to be present in bottled water as an additive or as a natural occurring mineral.

===Pakistan===
Due to contaminated water being widespread, in the mid-1980s urban families started installing filtration units at home. This later developed into companies providing mineral water delivery services at home. Use of these bottles that could be attached to a dispenser is still widespread.

Bottled water was made famous by one of the largest marketing campaigns in Pakistan history undertaken by Nestle. In 1998, Pakistan became the birthplace for the Nestle Pure Life bottled water brand. Other bottlers include dozens of local ones, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Mineral Drops by water icon, Nature, Vey, Nova Pure Water Larkana, Mina Water, Great Water Islamabad, Murree Sparklettes and Dew Drop. Other imported brands such as Evian also began marketing in the country.

===United States===

The U.S. is the second largest consumer market for bottled water in the world, followed by Mexico, Indonesia, and Brazil. China surpassed the United States to take the lead in 2013. In 2016, bottled water outsold carbonated soft drinks (by volume) to become the number one packaged beverage in the U.S. In 2018, bottled water consumption increased to 14 billion gallons, up 5.8 percent from 2017, with the average American drinking 41.9 gallons of bottled water annually.

In the United States, bottled water and tap water are regulated by different federal agencies: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates bottled water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the quality of tap water. The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia.

From 1970 (16 brands) over 1998 (50 brands) to 2012 (195 brands), the number of mineral water brands in the U.S. has grown exponentially.

China：

** The revenue generated in the Bottled Water market in 2023 amounts to US$72.5bn.
** This market is projected to grow annually by 6.75% from 2023 to 2027, according to the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).
** In global comparison, in the United States leads the way in terms of revenue, with US$94bn generated in 2023.
** When considering the total population figures, per person revenues in the Bottled Water market reach US$49.63 in 2023

==Consumer information==

===Labeling===
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates all packaged foods and beverage products, including bottled water, and mandates labeling requirements. FDA labeling requirements include a statement of the type of water in the container, compliance with the applicable definitions in the FDA Standards of Identity, ingredient labeling, name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer or distributor, net weight, and, if required, nutrition labeling.

===Consumer information===
Public water systems are required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide households in their service territories with a Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) that provides information on the quality of their water during the previous year. Such disclosures are not required by the FDA of any packaged food or beverage product, including bottled water. All packaged foods and beverages, must be manufactured according to FDA regulations and must meet all applicable quality and safety standards.

In Canada, bottled water must meet the standards in the Food and Drugs Act &amp; Regulations (FDAR) as it is considered a food. The FDAR works in partnership with Health Canada and Canadian in developing the policies regarding bottled water. The CFIA focuses more on regulations pertaining to packaging, labeling, advertising, and other safety practices, whereas the FDAR focuses more on the water itself. For example, the bottled water must meet the Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Regulations in Division 12, Part B of the Act must be met before it is approved for sale. Some of the regulations include: labeling terms, safety standards (i.e.: what is acceptable), and microbiological standards (i.e.: chlorine). In addition to this, the type of filtration method the water has gone through must be shown on the label, as stated in Section B.12.009 Additional information regarding regulations can be found on the CFIA website. The regulations specific to bottled water is in Division 12 and 15, which specify what can be added, such as the amount of arsenic and lead. Regulations are always being updated to conform with new scientific data, laws, new products, and new improvements. In terms of the types of water sold, spring and mineral water must meet the following criteria:

* originate from an underground source which is not part of a community water supply; and
* be naturally fit to drink (potable) at the source; and
* before bottling, not be treated in any way that changes the original chemical composition of the water. (The allowable treatments are discussed in section 1.2.)

In Canada, there are two categories of bottled water: 1) spring/mineral water, or 2) water other than mineral water or spring water.

==Emergency preparedness==
Emergency preparedness refers to the steps taken prior to a natural disaster or emergency to ensure safety throughout the event. The American Red Cross and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommend that individuals and families maintain disaster supply kits in the event that an emergency disrupts food supply or public water systems, blocks roads, or leaves people unable to find essentials. Following disasters such as floods, blizzards, or earthquakes, water sources can be cut off or contaminated, limiting access to safe, clean drinking water. For this reason, FEMA recommends that all disaster supply kits include one gallon of water per person per day for at least three days for drinking and sanitation. In hot climates, FEMA recommends doubling this quantity.

For the water supply, FEMA recommends commercially bottled water kept in a cool, dark place. As an alternative, FEMA recommends using disinfected food-grade water containers to store tap water and replacing the water every six months.

=== Contamination ===

In August 2014, city officials in Toledo, Ohio, banned local tap water after toxins from an algae bloom in Lake Erie were found in the city&#x27;s water supply. The American Red Cross and AmeriCares responded by helping coordinate the distribution of bottled water to the 500,000 area residents impacted by the ban.

Additionally, the city of Flint, MI, supplied bottled water to its residents for four years after it was discovered that their tap water was contamintated with lead, and elevated levels of total trihalomethanes (TTHM) – cancer-causing chemicals that are by-products of the chlorination of water. In addition, the contaminated tap water was blamed for a massive outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.

==Concerns==

Most bottled water containers are made from recyclable PET plastic, and some of these bottles end up in the waste stream in landfills. The financial and environmental costs of transportation of bottled water has been another concern because of the energy used and the consequent release of carbon dioxide and the potential impact on climate change.

Bottled water is bought for many different reasons including taste, convenience, poor tap water quality and safety concerns, health concerns and as a substitute for sugary drinks. The environmental impact, container safety, water origin, emergency supplies and role of the bottled water industry continue to be areas of concern for many people. In some cases it can be shown that bottled water is actually tap water. However, it is also argued that the quality specifications for some bottled waters in some jurisdictions are more stringent than the standards for tap-water. In the US, bottled water that comes from municipal suppliers must be clearly labeled as such unless it has been sufficiently processed to be labeled as &quot;distilled&quot; or &quot;purified&quot;.

One American study showed that &quot;even in areas with safe tap water, African American and Latino parents were three times more likely to give their children mostly bottled water compared to non-Latino white children, because of their belief that bottled water is safer, cleaner, better tasting, or more convenient.&quot; The economic implications of this also showed serious inequities: as a percentage of household income, whites reported median spending of 0.4% of their income on bottled water; African Americans and Latinos reported median spending to be more than twice as high.&quot; The study volunteers, &quot;For poor families, the use of bottled water may lead to less availability of resources for other health needs ... by the rather striking levels of expenditure on water relative to household income.&quot; On a global scale, markets for bottled water in poorer developing countries are growing rapidly due to increased fears of &quot;contaminated tap water, inadequate municipal water systems, and increased marketing on the part of bottled water companies.&quot; Sales of bottled water in Mexico, China, and parts of India are rising steeply.

===Perceptions about bottled water===
Bottled water is perceived by many as being a safer alternative to other sources of water such as tap water. Bottled water usage has increased even in countries where clean tap water is present. This may be attributed to consumers disliking the taste of tap water or its organoleptics. Another contributing factor to this shift could be the marketing success of bottled water. The success of bottled water marketing can be seen by Perrier&#x27;s transformation of a bottle of water into a status symbol. However, while bottled water has grown in both consumption and sales, the industry&#x27;s advertising expenses are considerably less than other beverages. According to the Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC), in 2013, the bottled water industry spent $60.6 million on advertising. That same year, sports drinks spent $128 million, sodas spent $564 million, and beer spent $1 billion.

Consumers tend to choose bottled water due to health related reasons. In communities that experience problems with their tap water, bottled water consumption is significantly higher. The International Bottled Water Association guidelines state that bottled water companies cannot compare their product to tap water in marketing operations. Consumers are also affected by memories associated with particular brands. For example, Coca-Cola took their Dasani product off the UK market after finding levels of bromate that were higher than legal standards because consumers in the UK associated this flaw with the Dasani product.

&quot;Bottled water sales are higher amongst African-American, Asians and Hispanic groups, which typically have lower incomes than whites.&quot; Some hypothesize that these differences are due to the geographic distribution of ethnic groups. It was theorized that ethnic differences in bottled water usage &quot;mirror the variability of water system quality between urban, suburban and rural areas (Abrahams et al. 2000) and it was also pointed out that they might reflect the memory of past problems caused by deficient tap-water systems in deprived areas (Olson 1999).&quot; In France, a similar geographic study in the early 1970s found that bottled water consumption was found to be much higher in urban areas (Ferrier 2001). This finding was &quot;also explained in terms of the poor quality of urban tap water and of the bad condition of the old lead pipes in French cities. Nonetheless, while poor tap water quality may motivate the public to search for alternative sources, it alone does not necessarily lead to higher consumption of bottled water.&quot;

Some surveys &quot;found that bottled water, far from being an alternative to tap water, seems to be mostly consumed as a substitute for alcoholic and traditional soft drinks (e.g. AWWA-RF 1993; FWR 1996) – the exception being when water contamination presents serious health risks and the trust in the tap water company is highly eroded (e.g. Lonnon 2004).&quot; Another explanation for the rise in popularity of bottled water is that &quot;the consumption of &#x27;pure&#x27; and &#x27;natural&#x27; bottled water in degraded environments may represent a symbolic purging behavior.&quot; Additional research has analyzed the commodification of bottled water through the corporate and cultural branding of nature, and how this commodification has added to the discourse around access to water as a human right. There is a long and storied history of the portrayal of water as a product of and necessity for nature. Richard Wilk argues that somewhere along the way from the early Christian idealization of water as a pure substance to our modern abilities to exert power over nature, people have formed opinions on the adequacy of water based on its delivery. Public access to clean water was once a dream of the industrial world, but now, according to Wilk, it is seen as dirty. Drawing on his own research and that of other scholars, he presents a complex ideological system: bottled water (which is water that has been exposed to human intervention) is understood as pure or acceptable; water directly from a natural source (which is water that has not been exposed to human intervention – a spring, river, glacier, etc.) is assumed to be dirty and not to be trusted; and water that is provided for the public (which is water from an anonymous source that is controlled by the town or state) is also seen as dirty and untrustworthy. Despite these varying views, bottled water companies have successfully infiltrated the consumer market. Marketers have recognized and fed into the fetishization or degradation of these different water sources. These marketing schemes have an emphasis on &quot;very old forms of value&quot; and the manipulation of &quot;distance, either increasing or decreasing it in geography, time, or social proximity&quot;. Wilk argues that the lack of consistency in which types and brands of water are available to all American consumers restricts individuals from exercising their personal moral and ethical ideals on sourcing their water. The struggle between trust and distrust of these water sources – whether it is natural or perceived to be natural – is central in the commodification of water.

Many low-income families avoid drinking tap water because they fear it may cause sickness. Bottled, filtered, and tap water are all for the most part safe in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency regulations for tap water are &quot;actually stricter than the Food and Drug Administration regulations for bottled water.&quot; A study of drinking water in Cincinnati, Ohio, discovered that bacterial counts in bottled water were often higher than those in tap water and fluoride concentration was inconsistent.

Globally, there is an intensifying environmental backlash against bottled water usage. As global consumption of bottled water soars, environmental groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Greenpeace have warned of the huge environmental footprint of the plastic in which the water is packaged. In 2001, a WWF study, &quot;Bottled water: understanding a social phenomenon&quot;, warned that in many countries, bottled water may be no safer or healthier than tap water and it sold for up to 1,000 times the price. It said the booming market would put severe pressure on recycling plastics and could lead to landfill sites drowning in mountains of plastic bottles. Also, the study found that the production of bottled water uses more water than the consumer actually buys in the bottle itself.

===Pricing===
Bottled water is more expensive than municipally-supplied tap water. Tap water sources and delivery systems (taps and faucets) are fixed in place while bottled water is available at many differing price points and in a variety of size formats.

&quot;The consumption of bottled and filtered water has dramatically increased in the United States during the past decade, with bottled water sales tripling to about $4 billion a year. More than 50% of the US population drinks bottled water and &#x27;people spend from 240 to over 10,000 times more per gallon for bottled water than they typically do for tap water.&#x27; An annual supply of bottled water for a person who consumes 8 glasses a day would cost approximately $200; the same amount of tap water would cost approximately $0.33. In general, women are more likely to drink bottled water than men, and Hispanic women are the group most likely to drink bottled water.&quot;

The Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC) states that in 2013, the average wholesale price per gallon of domestic non-sparkling bottled water was $1.21. BMC&#x27;s research also shows that consumers tend to buy bottled water in bulk from supermarkets (25.3%) or large discount retailers (57.9%) because it costs significantly less. Convenience stores are likely to have higher prices (4.5%), as do drug stores (2.8%). The remaining 9.5% is accounted for through vending machines, cafeterias and other food service outlets, and other types of sales.

===Bans===

In response to environmental and financial concerns, a few localities and U.S. colleges are banning bottled water sales.

In 2009, the small New South Wales town of Bundanoon voted to become the first town in the world to ban the selling or dispensing of bottled water. Bundanoon caught the attention of many other cities around the world.

After a Sydney-based beverage company wanted to open a water extraction plant in the New South Wales town Bundanoon, residents outlawed the sale of bottled water. The town continues to fight the company&#x27;s proposal in court.
&quot;In the same week the New South Wales state premier also banned all state departments and agencies from buying bottled water because of its huge environmental footprint, joining more than 70 cities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom that have banned bottled water in their departments.&quot;

In 2012, the town of Concord, Massachusetts, became the first in the United States to ban the sale of bottled water. Specifically, sales of non-sparkling, unflavored drinking water in single-serving polyethelyne terephthalate (PET) bottles of 1 litre (34 ounces) or less are prohibited. The ban went into effect on 1 January 2013.

== Commodification ==
The commodification of water into bottled water has led to the transformation of a once freely accessible resource into a widely marketed consumer product. Bottled water, initially introduced for its perceived purity and convenience, has become a global industry with substantial economic implications. In a 2006 article, American anthropologist Richard Wilk explored the commodification of bottled water, examining the cultural meanings embedded in water that are then manipulated by marketers, as well as the motivations behind the purchasing of bottled water. The commodification process involves branding, packaging, and marketing water as a commodity, often emphasizing qualities such as freshness, purity, and health benefits.

Wilk argues that the historical significance of water, from sacred springs to the modernist industrial theme of controlling nature, contributes to its unique capacity to convey both the magic of nature and technological mastery. Marketing strategies capitalize on nature-related imagery, using labels predominantly in blue and transparent bottles to emphasize purity. Wilk further examines the symbolic analysis of water&#x27;s associations with nature, purity, and danger. Bottled water also intersects with social distinctions, health claims, and the exoticizing of its origins to enhance value. Wilk also addresses that bottled water, often marketed as superior or purer than tap water, frequently originates from municipal water supplies. Despite claims of taste distinctions, blind tests often reveal indiscernible differences between tap and bottled water.

===Health concerns===
In the United States, bottled water and tap water are regulated by different federal agencies: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates bottled water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the quality of tap water. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act the EPA has set maximum contaminant levels for approximately 90 contaminants that might be found in drinking water and 15 secondary maximum contaminant levels.

In some areas, tap water may contain added fluoride, which helps prevent tooth decay and cavities. Some bottled water manufacturers in the United States add fluoride to their product, or provide a fluoridated bottled water product. The FDA of the United States does not require bottled water manufacturers to list the fluoride content on the label. However, unlike tap water where the amount of fluoride added by municipalities to drinking water is not federally regulated, the FDA has set specific limits for how much fluoride may be found in bottled water. Water fluoridation remains controversial in countries that require it (the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and a handful of other countries). Several studies have examined the content of fluoride and other chemicals in bottled water as well as the accuracy of these values as printed on the labels showing some significant difference between labeled and measured value.

According to a 1999 NRDC study, in which roughly 22 percent of brands were tested, at least one sample of bottled drinking water contained chemical contaminants at levels above strict state health limits. Some of the contaminants found in the study could pose health risks if consumed over a long period of time. The NRDC report conceded that &quot;most waters contained no detectable bacteria, however, and the level of synthetic organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals of concern for which [they] were tested were either below detection limits or well below all applicable standards.&quot; Meanwhile, a report by the Drinking Water Research Foundation found that of all samples tested by NRDC, &quot;federal FDA or EPA limits were allegedly exceeded only four times, twice for total coliforms and twice for fluorides.&quot;

Studies show that the plastics used for bottles contain chemicals having estrogenic activity, even when they claim otherwise. Although some of the bottled water contained in glass were found polluted with chemicals as well, the researchers believe some of the contamination of water in the plastic containers may have come from the plastic containers. Leaching of chemicals into the water is related to the plastic bottles being exposed to either low or high temperatures.

A 2018 study found that the vast majority of bottled water contains microplastics. Following this, the World Health Organization has launched a review into the safety of drinking microplastics. Analysis of some of the world&#x27;s most popular bottled water brands found that more than 90% contained tiny pieces of plastic. The tests were carried out at the State University of New York at Fredonia as part of a project involving original research and reporting by the US-based journalism organization Orb Media. Using a dye called Nile Red, which binds to free-floating pieces of plastic, the university&#x27;s Sherri Mason found an average of 10 plastic particles per litre of water, each larger than the size of a human hair. Smaller particles assumed to be plastic but not positively identified were found as well – an average of 314 per litre.

In 2008, researchers from Arizona State University found that storing plastic bottles in temperatures at or above 60 °C can cause antimony to enter the water contained in the bottles. Therefore, frequently drinking from bottles stored in places such as cars during the summer months may have negative health effects.

===Safety===
There have been no major outbreaks of illness or serious safety concerns associated with bottled water in the past decade, an FDA official stated in testimony before a 9 July 2009 Congressional hearing. Conversely, as noted in the Drinking Water Research Foundation&#x27;s (DWRF) 2013 report, &quot;Microbial Health Risks of Regulated Drinking Waters in the United States&quot;, EPA researchers reported an estimated 16.4 million cases of acute gastrointestinal illness per year are caused by tap water. Subsequent research has estimated that number of illnesses to be closer to 19.5 million cases per year.

===Bottled water versus carbonated beverages===
Bottled noncarbonated drinking water competes in the marketplace with carbonated beverages (including carbonated water) sold in individual plastic bottles. Consumption of water often is considered a healthier substitute for sodas.

According to the Container Recycling Institute, sales of flavoured, non-carbonated drinks are expected to surpass soda sales by 2010. In response, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola have introduced new carbonated drinks that are fortified with vitamins and minerals, Diet Coke Plus and Tava, marketed as &quot;sparkling beverages&quot;.

===Bottled water versus tap water===

Bottled water may have reduced amounts of copper, lead, and other metal contaminants since it does not run through the plumbing pipes where tap water is exposed to metal corrosion; however, this varies by the household and plumbing system.

In much of the developed world, chlorine often is added as a disinfectant to tap water. If the water contains organic matter, this may produce other byproducts in the water such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, which has shown to increase the risk of cancer. The level of residual chlorine found at around 0.0002 g per litre, which is too small to cause any health problems directly. The chlorine concentration recommended by World Health Organization is between 0.0002 and 0.0005 g/L.

The documentary &quot;Tapped&quot; argues against the bottled water industry, asserting that tap water is healthier, more environmentally sustainable, and more ecologically sound than bottled water. The film focuses on the bottled water industry in the United States. The film has received largely positive reviews, and has spawned college campus groups such as Beyond the Bottle. Yet, as many people remain generally unaware of the negative health and environmental impacts associated with bottled water, recent research in environmental psychology has started to investigate how to reduce the public&#x27;s consumption of bottled water.

<text>Eythrope (previously Ethorp) is a hamlet and country house in the parish of Waddesdon, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located to the south east of the main village of Waddesdon. It was bought in the 1870s by a branch of the Rothschild family, and belongs to them to this day.

Eythrope is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England, and its gardens are also grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==History==
The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &quot;island farm&quot;, referring to an island in the River Thame that flows by the hamlet. The medieval village of Eythrope is deserted and all that remains are some earthen banks and ditches on the eastern side of Eythrope Park. There was a manor house at this hamlet as early as 1309, when it was the home of the Arches family. One former owner, Sir Roger Dynham, built a chantry chapel on what is now the site of the pavilion. This was demolished by Sir William Stanhope in the 1730s.

The mansion was extended in 1610 by Dorothy Pelham, (One source says Sir William Dormer) this was her house from her first marriage. Her second husband William Pelham styled himself as &quot;from Eythorpe&quot;, but this was more true of Dorothy who had her own financial independence.

William Stanhope (1702–1772) embellished Eythrope House around 1750. Stanhope employed Isaac Ware to build new stables (now lost) and follies in the garden and park. Two of these buildings survive: the grotto by the lake, and the bridge over the River Thame. The house was demolished in 1810-11 by Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield.

In 1875, the manor at Eythrope was bought by Alice de Rothschild. She was the sister and companion of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild who owned the neighboring estate Waddesdon Manor. The new house at Eythrope was not built on the site of the old manor. While building was in progress Alice fell ill with rheumatic fever and was advised to avoid damp conditions at night. As Eythrope was next to the river Thame, the plans were altered. The house was built without bedrooms as a place to house her collections and entertain guests during the day.

Alice chose one of the Rothschild family&#x27;s favourite architects George Devey who had worked at nearby Ascott House, Aston Clinton House and in the villages belonging to the Mentmore Estate. Eythrope was something of a deviation from his usual approach. It is constructed in red brick with stone dressings. With its twisting chimneys, turrets and gables, it is a mixture of Devey&#x27;s usual Jacobean style and the French Renaissance architecture of Waddesdon Manor. This is especially noticeable on the concave roof to the round tower, and the gable on the garden facade which are particularly reminiscent of Waddesdon. Because of its small size the house was christened &quot;The Pavilion&quot; or the &quot;Water Pavilion&quot;.

As in other Rothschild homes, French panelling and furniture dressed the rooms. Alice also collected Renaissance sculpture, paintings and maiolica ware.

Around the house, Alice developed 30 acres of highly ornamental and innovative gardens that complemented the splendour of Waddesdon Manor. She also created a four-acre walled kitchen garden and added an Old English Tea House (now lost) to the historic parkland. A large, rectangular stable block (listed grade II), built in stone and half-timber, and three picturesque lodges, were probably designed by W Taylor &amp; Son of Bierton. House parties from Waddesdon Manor would drive the four miles for tea, taking a steam launch up the river to the tea house.

In 1922 following Alice&#x27;s death, The Pavilion was inherited by James Armand de Rothschild and his wife Dorothy. From 1922 to around 1939, they let it to Syrie Maugham, the estranged wife of Somerset Maugham. She added bedrooms and bathrooms to the Pavilion, but by 1957 the wing was structurally unsound. In the 1957, James de Rothschild bequeathed Waddesdon Manor, which he had inherited, to the National Trust. His widow, Dorothy, then moved to the smaller pavilion and made substantial alterations and enlargements in a solid late Victorian/Edwardian architectural style which complemented the original building. 
==Present day==
Dorothy de Rothschild died in 1988 leaving the estate and Pavilion to her husband&#x27;s great nephew, Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild. The Pavilion, the private home of Lord Rothschild, is the only one of the Buckinghamshire Rothschilds seven houses to remain in Rothschild hands.

The gardens continue to be developed and maintained, growing vegetables, fruit and flowers for the estate. The walled garden was redesigned by Lady Mary Keen in 1990. Keen created several gardens at different levels within the four acre walled garden. These included a large vegetable garden, a herb garden, Mediterranean pot garden, rose garden and a long late flowering herbaceous border which runs as an artery through the gardens. A large Victorian glasshouse recreated on the foundations of an earlier glass house is used for the forcing of early cherries. Five further glasshouses are used for a variety of flowering plants and succulents and, in the summer, for growing several varieties of tomato.

==TV &amp; film==
Scenes from &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; by Agatha Christie, screened on BBC One from 26 to 28 December 2015, were filmed on the Estate roads and on the bridge at Eythrope.

<doc id="402928" wikidata="Q912265" url="?curid=402928" title="Dagesh">
<text>The dagesh ( &quot;dagésh&quot;) is a diacritic that is used in the Hebrew alphabet. It takes the form of a dot placed inside a consonant. A can either indicate a &quot;hard&quot; plosive version of the consonant (known as , literally &#x27;light dot&#x27;) or that the consonant is geminated (known as , literally &#x27;hard dot&#x27;), although the latter is rarely used in Modern Hebrew.

The was added to Hebrew orthography at the same time as the Masoretic system of (vowel points).

Two other diacritics with different functions, the and the , are visually identical to the but are only used with vowel letters.

The and symbols are often omitted when writing (e.g. is written as ). In these cases, may be added to help readers resolve the ambiguity. The use or omission of such marks is usually consistent throughout any given context.

== Dagesh qal ==
A &#x27; or &#x27; (, or , also &quot; lene&quot;, &quot;weak/light dagesh&quot;) may be placed inside the consonants , , , , and . They each have two sounds, the original hard plosive sound (which originally contained no as it was the only pronunciation), and a soft fricative version produced as such for speech efficiency because of the position in which the mouth is left immediately after a vowel has been produced.

Prior to the Babylonian captivity, the soft sounds of these letters did not exist in Hebrew, but were later differentiated in Hebrew writing as a result of the Aramaic-influenced pronunciation of Hebrew. The Aramaic languages, including Jewish versions of Aramaic, have these same allophonic pronunciations of the letters.

The letters take on their hard sounds when they have no vowel sound before them, and take their soft sounds when a vowel immediately precedes them. In Biblical Hebrew this was the case within a word and also across word boundaries, though in Modern Hebrew there are no longer across word boundaries, since the soft and hard sounds are no longer allophones of each other, but regarded as distinct phonemes.

When vowel diacritics are used, the hard sounds are indicated by a central dot called , while the soft sounds lack the mark. In Modern Hebrew, however, the only changes the pronunciation of , , and . Traditional Ashkenazic pronunciation also varies the pronunciation of , and some traditional Middle Eastern pronunciations carry alternate forms for .

In Ashkenazi pronunciation, without a is pronounced , while in other traditions it is assumed to have been pronounced at the time was introduced. In Modern Hebrew, it is always pronounced .

The letters () and () may also contain a . This indicates an allophonic variation of the phonemes and , a variation which no longer exists in modern Hebrew pronunciation. The variations are believed to have been: pronounced as , as , as , and as . The Hebrew spoken by the Jews of Yemen (Yemenite Hebrew) still preserves unique phonemes for these letters with and without a dagesh.
===Pronunciation===
Among Modern Hebrew speakers, the pronunciation of some of the above letters has become the same as others:
== Dagesh hazaq ==
 or (, , i.e. &#x27;gemination &#x27;, or , also &#x27; forte&#x27;) may be placed in almost any letter, indicating a gemination (doubling) of that consonant in the pronunciation of pre-modern Hebrew. This gemination is not adhered to in modern Hebrew and is only used in careful pronunciation, such as the reading of scripture in a synagogue service, recitation of biblical or traditional texts or on ceremonial occasions, and only by very precise readers.

The following letters, the gutturals, almost never have a : , , , , and . A few instances of with are recorded in the Masoretic Text, as well as a few cases of with , such as in Leviticus 23:17.

The presence of a or consonant-doubling in a word may be entirely morphological, or, as is often the case, is a lengthening to compensate for a deleted consonant. A may be placed in letters for one of the following reasons:

* The letter follows the definite article, the word &quot;the&quot;. For example, (, &#x27;heaven(s)&#x27;) in Genesis 1:8 is (, &#x27;the heaven(s)&#x27;) in Genesis 1:1. This is because the definite article was originally a stand-alone particle (), but at an early stage in ancient Hebrew it contracted into a prefix (), and the loss of the &#x27;l&#x27; was compensated for by doubling the following letter. In this situation where the following letter is a guttural, the vowel in &#x27;ha-&#x27; becomes long to compensate for the inability to double the next letter - otherwise, this vowel is almost always short. This also happens in words taking the prefix , since it is a prefix created by the contraction of and . Occasionally, the letter following a which is used to indicate a question may also receive a , e.g. Numbers 13:20 (, &#x27;whether it is fat&#x27;).
* The letter follows the prefix where this prefix is an abbreviation for the word , meaning &#x27;from&#x27;. For example, the phrase &quot;from your hand&quot;, if spelled as two words, would be (). In Genesis 4:11 however, it occurs as one word: . This prefix mostly replaces the usage of the particle () in modern Hebrew.
* The letter follows the prefix &#x27;she-&#x27; in modern Hebrew, which is a prefixed contraction of the relative pronoun (), where the first letter is dropped and the last letter disappears and doubles the next letter. This prefix is rare in Biblical texts, and mostly replaces the use of in Modern Hebrew.
* It marks the doubling of a letter that is caused by a weak letter losing its vowel. In these situations, the weak letter disappears, and the following letter is doubled to compensate for it. For example, compare Exodus 6:7 () with Numbers 23:28, where the first letter of the root has been elided: (). Lamed only behaves as a weak letter in this particular root word.
* If the letter follows a vav-consecutive imperfect (sometimes referred to as conversive, or ), which, in Biblical Hebrew, switches a verb between perfect and imperfect. For example, compare Judges 7:4 (, &#x27;let him go&#x27;) with Deuteronomy 31:1 (, &#x27;he went&#x27;). A possible reason for this doubling is that the () prefix could be the remains of an auxiliary verb (, the ancient form of the verb , &#x27;to be&#x27;) being contracted into a prefix, losing the initial , and the final syllable disappearing and doubling the next letter.
* In some of the verbal stems, where the , and stems themselves cause doubling in the second root letter of a verb. For example:
** Exodus 15:9 (, &#x27;I shall divide&#x27;), -stem, first person future tense 
** in the phrase (, &#x27;praise the &#x27;), where is in the -stem, masculine plural imperative form
** Genesis 47:31 (, &#x27;he strengthened himself&#x27;), -stem

== Rafe ==
In Masoretic manuscripts the opposite of a would be indicated by a , a small line on top of the letter. This is no longer found in Hebrew, but may still sometimes be seen in Yiddish and Ladino.
== Unicode encodings ==
In computer typography there are two ways to use a with Hebrew text. The following examples give the Unicode and numeric character references:

*Using combining characters:
** + : = codice_1codice_2 or codice_3codice_4
** + : = codice_5codice_2 or codice_7codice_4
** + : = codice_9codice_2 or codice_11codice_4
*Using precomposed characters:
** with : = codice_13 or codice_14
** with : = codice_15 or codice_16
** with : = codice_17 or codice_18

Some fonts, character sets, encodings, and operating systems may support neither, one, or both methods.

<doc id="402929" wikidata="Q193983" url="?curid=402929" title="Metalanguage">
<text>In logic and linguistics, a metalanguage is a language used to describe another language, often called the &quot;object language&quot;. Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in the object language by the use of italics, quotation marks, or writing on a separate line. The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a metasyntax. For example, to say that the word &quot;noun&quot; can be used as a noun in a sentence, one could write &quot;&quot;noun&quot; is a &lt;noun&gt;&quot;.

== Types of metalanguage==

There are a variety of recognized types of metalanguage, including &quot;embedded&quot;, &quot;ordered&quot;, and &quot;nested&quot; (or &quot;hierarchical&quot;) metalanguages.

=== Embedded ===

An &quot;embedded metalanguage&quot; is a language formally, naturally and firmly fixed in an object language. This idea is found in Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s book, &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;, in a discussion of the relationship between formal languages and number theory: &quot;... it is in the nature of any formalization of number theory that its metalanguage is embedded within it.&quot;

It occurs in natural, or informal, languages, as well—such as in English, where words such as &quot;noun&quot;, &quot;verb&quot;, or even &quot;word&quot; describe features and concepts pertaining to the English language itself.

=== Ordered ===

An &quot;ordered metalanguage&quot; is analogous to an ordered logic. An example of an ordered metalanguage is the construction of one metalanguage to discuss an object language, followed by the creation of another metalanguage to discuss the first, etc.

=== Nested ===

A &quot;nested&quot; (or &quot;hierarchical&quot;) &quot;metalanguage&quot; is similar to an ordered metalanguage in that each level represents a greater degree of abstraction. However, a nested metalanguage differs from an ordered one in that each level includes the one below.

The paradigmatic example of a nested metalanguage comes from the Linnean taxonomic system in biology. Each level in the system incorporates the one below it. The language used to discuss genus is also used to discuss species; the one used to discuss orders is also used to discuss genera, etc., up to kingdoms.

== In natural language ==

Natural language combines nested and ordered metalanguages. In a natural language there is an infinite regress of metalanguages, each with more specialized vocabulary and simpler syntax.

Designating the language now as formula_1, the grammar of the language is a discourse in the metalanguage formula_2, which is a sublanguage nested within formula_1.

* The grammar of formula_2, which has the form of a factual description, is a discourse in the meta–metalanguage formula_5, which is also a sublanguage of formula_1. 
* The grammar of formula_5, which has the form of a theory describing the syntactic structure of such factual descriptions, is stated in the meta–meta–metalanguage formula_8, which likewise is a sublanguage of formula_1. 
* The grammar of formula_8 has the form of a metatheory describing the syntactic structure of theories stated in formula_5. 
* formula_12 and succeeding metalanguages have the same grammar as formula_8, differing only in reference.

Since all of these metalanguages are sublanguages of formula_1, formula_2 is a nested metalanguage, but formula_5 and sequel are ordered metalanguages. Since all these metalanguages are sublanguages of formula_1 they are all embedded languages with respect to the language as a whole.

Metalanguages of formal systems all resolve ultimately to natural language, the &#x27;common parlance&#x27; in which mathematicians and logicians converse to define their terms and operations and &#x27;read out&#x27; their formulae.

== Types of expressions ==
There are several entities commonly expressed in a metalanguage. In logic usually the object language that the metalanguage is discussing is a formal language, and very often the metalanguage as well.

=== Deductive systems ===

A &quot;deductive system&quot; (or, &quot;deductive apparatus&quot; of a formal system) consists of the axioms (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference that can be used to derive the theorems of the system.

=== Metavariables ===

A &quot;metavariable&quot; (or &quot;metalinguistic&quot; or &quot;metasyntactic&quot; variable) is a symbol or set of symbols in a metalanguage which stands for a symbol or set of symbols in some object language. For instance, in the sentence:

:Let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be arbitrary formulas of a formal language formula_18.

The symbols &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are not symbols of the object language formula_18, they are metavariables in the metalanguage (in this case, English) that is discussing the object language formula_18.

=== Metatheories and metatheorems ===

A &quot;metatheory&quot; is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory (a theory about a theory). Statements made in the metatheory about the theory are called metatheorems. A &quot;metatheorem&quot; is a true statement about a formal system expressed in a metalanguage. Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a metatheory, and may reference concepts that are present in the metatheory but not the object theory.

=== Interpretations ===

An &quot;interpretation&quot; is an assignment of meanings to the symbols and words of a language.

== Role in metaphor ==

Michael J. Reddy (1979) argues that much of the language we use to talk about language is conceptualized and structured by what he refers to as the conduit metaphor. This paradigm operates through two distinct, related frameworks.

The &quot;major framework&quot; views language as a sealed pipeline between people:
The &quot;minor framework&quot; views language as an open pipe spilling mental content into the void:
== Metaprogramming ==

Computers follow programs, sets of instructions in a formal language. The development of a programming language involves the use of a metalanguage. The act of working with metalanguages in programming is known as &quot;metaprogramming&quot;.

Backus–Naur form, developed in the 1960s by John Backus and Peter Naur, is one of the earliest metalanguages used in computing. Examples of modern-day programming languages which commonly find use in metaprogramming include ML, Lisp, m4, and Yacc.

<doc id="402934" wikidata="Q1200136" url="?curid=402934" title="Spin the bottle">
<text>Spin the bottle is a kissing party game stereotypically played by teenagers. The game was very popular among teenagers during the second half of the 20th century because it fostered &quot;sexual&quot; interactions between boys and girls. It has even been described as &quot;the party game of choice for glandularly excited high schoolers&quot;. It has been described as a coming-of-age party game.

Even though the game might be played occasionally by young teenagers or young adults, its popularity has declined since the 1980s.

==Gameplay and rules==
The game is played by several players who sit, stand, or kneel in a circle. A bottle (typically an empty glass soda or beer bottle) is placed on the floor in the center of the circle. A player spins the bottle, and must kiss the person to whom the bottle points when it stops spinning. Alternatively, the person to whom the bottle is pointing must kiss the person at the rear end of the bottle.

There are a very large number of variants. One variant is that instead, two players must hug within five seconds, otherwise, they have to kiss in 10 seconds and if the 10 seconds are up and they have not kissed, then they have to French kiss. Variations allow for other tasks to be accomplished. It can also be used to decide the players for other games, such as truth or dare or seven minutes in heaven. Variations may also include penalties, such as removing a piece of clothing.

==History==
Written records of bottle-spinning games date back to the 1920s, though early accounts make no mention of kissing. 
Written records of a similar game, called &quot;Bottle of Fortune&quot;, are available dating back to 1927.

<doc id="402936" wikidata="Q2152461" url="?curid=402936" title="Paddock Wood">
<text>Paddock Wood is a town and civil parish in the borough of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England, about southwest of Maidstone. At the 2001 Census it had a population of 8,263, falling marginally to 8,253 at the 2011 Census. Paddock Wood is a centre for hop growing.

==History==
Paddock Wood developed as a settlement during the second half of the 19th century as a result of the local hops industry. By 1900 it was a local transport hub with three railway lines at the railway station.

==Government==
Paddock Wood has three tiers of local government: town (parish), borough and county.

===Borough council===
Since 1974 Paddock Wood has formed part of the Borough of Tunbridge Wells. The borough is governed by a 48-member council. The town elects 4 borough councillors, with 2 each for the Paddock Wood East and Paddock Wood West wards. As of July 2022, one is a member of the Labour Party, one is a member of the Liberal Democrats one is a member of local action group Tunbridge Wells Alliance, and one is an Independent.

===County council===
The upper tier of local government is provided by Kent County Council. The county council has 81 members, with each representing an electoral district. Paddock Wood forms part of the electoral district of Tunbridge Wells Rural.

==Geography==
The commercial areas of Paddock Wood are separated by the railway line.

To the South of the railway lies &quot;Commercial Road&quot; which runs north east to south west through the town, and is the main shopping street. At the north east end of the street is the entrance to the Railway Station. &quot;Commercial Road&quot; is home to the branches of several banks, a variety of take-aways, a restaurant and a number of small shops. To the east of &quot;Commercial Road&quot;, runs &quot;Maidstone Road&quot;. This road runs north to Beltring and East Peckham, and south to Matfield, and is the main route into and out of the town.

To the north of the railway line lie the industrial areas. &quot;Eldon Way Industrial Estate&quot; can be found to the east and is home to British Car Auctions, among others. To the west is the larger &quot;Transfesa Road&quot; and &quot;Paddock Wood Distribution Centre&quot;. This is the home to a number of companies including Gabriel Chemie UK Ltd, Norman Collett, CoolChain, Mack Multiples, Warburtons and a Whirlpool warehouse, which was destroyed in a large fire in early July 2005.

==Culture and community==

Mascalls Gallery, was a public art gallery opened in 2006. It closed in 2016, due to a lack of funds.

Although technically in Beltring, in the civil parish of East Peckham, the nearby Hop Farm hosts many events such as the circus, monster truck racing and music festivals.

St Andrew&#x27;s Church is a joint Anglican and Methodist church located on Maidstone Road.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from either the Tunbridge Wells or Bluebell Hill TV transmitters, BBC London and ITV London can also be received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Kent on 96.7 FM, Heart South on 103.1 FM, Gold on 603 AM and KMFM West Kent on 96.2 FM. As of November 2021, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells, Paddock Wood and Southborough are now served by community radio station West Kent Radio broadcasting on 106.7FM and 95.5FM.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Kent and Sussex Courier.

==Transport==
Paddock Wood is on the B2160 and B2161 roads and not too far from the A228, A264, A21 and A26 roads. The A21 in the area suffers from congestion and traffic problems. It is served by Paddock Wood railway station.

==Education==
The town&#x27;s main primary school is Paddock Wood Primary School which was originally built in 1909, which has approximately 600 pupils.

The town&#x27;s main secondary school is Mascalls Academy (formerly Mascalls School), a comprehensive secondary school which opened in 1956, which has approximately 1400 pupils.

==Literary references==

Paddock Wood Railway station appears in the novel Dombey and Son by Charles Dickens where, in chapter 55, the character of Mr Carker accidentally falls under a train at the station and is killed. Some Dickens scholars believe that Paddock Wood is the rural railway station described in &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;. Some believe that one of Charles Dickens&#x27;s children was buried in the graveyard as it says on the sign at the entrance.

<text>The Vogues are an American vocal rock and roll group from Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. The original lineup consisted of Bill Burkette (lead baritone), Don Miller (baritone), Hugh Geyer (first tenor), and Chuck Blasko (second tenor).

They are best known for their chart-topping singles &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;, &quot;Five O&#x27;Clock World&quot;, &quot;Magic Town&quot;, &quot;My Special Angel&quot; and &quot;Turn Around, Look at Me&quot;. In addition to touring the world, the group appeared on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Career==

The group, originally named the Val-Aires, formed in 1958 at Turtle Creek High School. They signed with Pittsburgh manager Elmer Willet, who produced their first recording release &quot;Which One Will It Be/Launie My Love&quot;. DJ Porky Chedwick became a supporter booking the group for his rock and roll shows and record hops. Chedwick put them on bills with the Drifters, the Platters, and the Dells. Clark Race of KDKA radio promoted the group on his KDKA-TV dance show. Having strong regional sales, the single was picked up for national distribution by Coral Records.

After high school, members of the group variously joined the Army or went to college. After their enlistments and college degrees were completed, they decided to record again. Each member paid $100 towards the fee to record a demo tape. They hired Nick Cenci, who had helped bring Lou Christie mainstream success, to produce the recording. In 1965, Cenci produced recording sessions for the Val-Aires at Gateway Studios in Pittsburgh, including vocals for a cover of the Petula Clark song &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;, which was released on the band&#x27;s own Blue Star label. Cenci then persuaded John Rook, program director of KQV, to play the single. With local airplay and sales Cenci signed them to the Co &amp; Ce label as the &quot;Vogues&quot; and secured national distribution. The song soon became a national hit reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Later in 1965, Cenci produced another Vogues recording session, which resulted in the No. 4 Billboard hit, &quot;Five O&#x27;Clock World&quot;.

In 1966, Co &amp; Ce Records released the singles &quot;Magic Town&quot;, which reached no. 21 in April of that year, and the no. 29 &quot;The Land of Milk and Honey&quot;. The singles &quot;Summer Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Lovers of the World Unite&quot; were released on Co &amp; Ce in 1967. Co &amp; Ce leased the Vogues to Reprise Records (distributed by Warner Bros.) where they found success with cover versions of &quot;Turn Around, Look at Me&quot; (No. 7), &quot;My Special Angel&quot; (No. 7), &quot;Till&quot; (No. 27), &quot;No, Not Much&quot; (No. 34), &quot;Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)&quot; (No. 42), &quot;Moments to Remember&quot; (No. 47), and &quot;Green Fields&quot; (No. 92). Dick Glasser also produced several unreleased singles by The Vogues for Reprise, including Paul Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Unbelievable (Inconceivable) You&quot;. The original group appeared on popular TV shows in the 1960s, including &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Shindig&quot;, &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, and &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;.

In 1971, the Vogues signed a recording contract with Bell Records and recorded three singles (&quot;Love Song&quot;, &quot;Take Time to Tell Her&quot;, and &quot;American Family&quot;). In 1972, the group released one single on Mainstream Records (&quot;Need You&quot; b/w &quot;Greatest Show on Earth&quot;). By 1973, Geyer had left the group. Now recording for 20th Century Records, the group released three singles (&quot;My Prayer&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Summer&quot;, and &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;), which were commercially unsuccessful and represented the last singles released by The Vogues.

Miller left the group in 1974 and was replaced by a succession of other vocalists. By the 1980s, the group had stopped touring and were concentrating on Western Pennsylvania venues. Burkette left the group in 1983, leaving Chuck Blasko as the only original member of The Vogues. Vocalist Gary Racan joined Chuck Blasko &amp; The Vogues and performed with them for 16 years, departing to start his own band. In 2022 Racan filled in several shows with the Troy Elich led Vogues. During one show Racan was reunited with Bo Wagner, his former bandmate from Chuck Blasko&#x27;s Vogues.

At some point during the late 1970s or early 1980s, the group&#x27;s manager trademarked the name and assets of the Vogues. He later sold the trademark to Bengar Inc (Pete Garofalo), who starting booking other quartets as the Vogues. Pete Garofalo was a baritone who was with The Vogues from 1973 through the early 1990s. While owner of the trademark, he performed with them as well as having a group touring on the road. Pete Garofalo died in 1997, which led to the sale of the trademark. The trademark was sold several times, resulting in a variety of unrelated groups of singers claiming to be the Vogues. In 2000, the trademark was purchased by vocalist and Pittsburgh area native Stan Elich. During these years Blasko continued to perform as the Vogues, clashed with the &quot;trademark&quot; group, and eventually testified in front of Congress on the Truth in Music Act. A lawsuit filed by Blasko ended with the Pennsylvania court permitting Blasko&#x27;s Vogues to perform in 14 Western Pennsylvania counties and the &quot;trademark&quot; group to perform everywhere else in the world as The Vogues.

From 2004 until 2006, Geyer joined Blasko&#x27;s Vogues in the 14 Western Pennsylvania counties that Blasko&#x27;s group was permitted to tour in. After creative differences with Blasko, Geyer left Blasko&#x27;s group at the end of 2006. In March 2007, Geyer joined the nationally touring &quot;trademark&quot; group of The Vogues of trademark owner Elich. Geyer continued to perform with this group until his retirement in December 2012. Upon his retirement he was replaced by Royce Taylor, who had previously been a member of The Vogues from 1983 to 1997. In May 2008, original lead vocalist Bill Burkette also joined Geyer in touring the US with the &quot;trademark&quot; Vogues. The members of this group included Burkette, Geyer, Elich, Elich&#x27;s son Troy, and Jim Campagna. Stan Elich died in December 2010. Troy Elich now owns the trademark &quot;The Vogues&quot;.

In 2010, the Stan Elich-owned Vogues released a live album, &quot;The Vogues Sings the Hits Live&quot;, on the Desert Trax Music label. This marked the first time in 38 years that Burkette and Geyer recorded together.

After Bill Burkette&#x27;s death in March, 2018, he was replaced by Bo Wagner, who had been filling in during Burkette&#x27;s illness. Wagner had been a member of Blasko&#x27;s Vogues from 1983 to 1997. Wagner left the Vogues in 2023 due to health issues. Bo (Robert H. Bogesdorfer) Wagner died on July 13, 2024 at the age of 78. Tennessee native Elliott McCoy replaced Wagner in 2023.

The Vogues&#x27; lineup as of March, 2024 are Troy Elich, Royce Taylor, and Elliott McCoy.

In 2020 it was announced that The Vogues would for the first time be a part of The Turtles &quot;Happy Together Tour&quot;. But due to the COVID-19 pandemic most of the tour was cancelled. The Vogues were again scheduled to be in the tour in 2021, but like 2020, many dates were cancelled due to COVID-19. When 2022 rolled around The Vogues were ready to go head on in the Happy Together Tour. Bo Wagner made the decision to sit out the rigorous tour. He was replaced on tour by Shawn Stevens, who at one time had performed as a member of The Diamonds. The Vogues were once again a part of the Happy Together Tour in 2023, with Shawn Stevens filling in again for Bo Wagner.

The Vogues will again be a part of the Happy Together tour in 2024, with the line up of Elich, Taylor and Sean Moran (another former member of Blasko&#x27;s Pittsburgh group) filling for McCoy.

In 2025, for the 5th year in a row, The Vogues (Troy Elich, Royce Taylor and Sean Moran) will appear on the &quot;Happy Together Tour&quot; with The Turtles, The Cowsills, Mark Lindsay, Jay &amp; The Americans, and Little Anthony and The Imperials.

In 2022, The Vogues released the album &quot;Still Tickin&#x27;&quot;, featuring all new recordings of the top ten favorite hits.

The original group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001.

Bill Burkette (born William W. Burkette III on September 17, 1942) died of lymphoma on March 1, 2018, at the age of 75.

Don Miller died on January 11, 2021, reportedly of COVID-19, at age 80.

<text>This is a list of games that are played by children. Traditional children&#x27;s games do not include commercial products such as board games but do include games which require props such as hopscotch or marbles (toys go in List of toys unless the toys are used in multiple games or the single game played is named after the toy; thus &quot;jump rope&quot; is a game, while &quot;Jacob&#x27;s ladder&quot; is a toy). Despite being transmitted primarily through word of mouth due to not being considered suitable for academic study or adult attention, traditional games have &quot;not only failed to disappear but have also evolved over time into new versions.&quot;

Traditional children&#x27;s games are defined &quot;as those that are played informally with minimal equipment, that children learn by example from other children, and that can be played without reference to written rules. These games are usually played by children between the ages of 7 and 12, with some latitude on both ends of the age range.&quot; &quot;Children&#x27;s traditional games (also called folk games) are those that are passed from child to child, generation to generation, informally by word of mouth,&quot; and most children&#x27;s games include at least two of the following six features in different proportion: physical skill, strategy, chance, repetition of patterns, creativity, and vertigo.

== History ==

From the 18th century onwards, researchers have taken a greater interest in the value of traditional games in elucidating cultural values and identities. The modern Olympic Games were influenced by this thinking, and were founded by Pierre de Coubertin on the basis of &quot;All games, all nations&quot;, though this aspect of the Olympics was never fully realised and quickly faded away after a few years, with mainly only Western sports being played. In some European countries, the revival of traditional games has served as a way for regional identities to be expressed in a political or educational way.

<doc id="402945" wikidata="Q7511869" url="?curid=402945" title="Sig Alert">
<text>Sig alert, Sig-alert or Sigalert in California, as well as other parts of the United States, means an incident that significantly disrupts road traffic. The term was originally the name of a pioneering system of automated radio broadcasts regarding traffic conditions, introduced in the 1950s and named after its inventor, Loyd Sigmon. 

A Sigalert is defined by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) as &quot;any unplanned event that causes the closing of one lane of traffic for 30 minutes or more&quot;. In practice, the term refers to a notice of such a closure issued by the CHP, and Sigalerts are posted on the CHP website, broadcast on radio and television stations throughout California, and signaled to motorists via electronic message signs on the freeways. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) defines it as any traffic incident that will tie up two or more lanes of a freeway for two or more hours.

The term was added in 1993 to the &quot;New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. In practice, there is no standard spelling; the CHP website uses &quot;SIG Alerts&quot; and &quot;Sigalert&quot; while Caltrans uses &quot;Sig-Alert&quot;.

SigAlerts originated in 1955 with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). By the early 1950s, the rapidly growing number of automobiles in Los Angeles had greatly increased the frequency and severity of traffic accidents and jams. Radio stations reported traffic conditions, but the LAPD refused to call radio stations with this information, so each station would call the LAPD. Using the telephone to distribute the information tied up telephone lines and forced officers to repeat the same information again and again.

In 1955, Loyd C. &quot;Sig&quot; Sigmon began developing a solution. Sigmon was executive vice president of Golden West Broadcasters (a company owned by singing cowboy Gene Autry). Sigmon had worked for Golden West&#x27;s station KMPC 710 in 1941 but found himself in the United States Army Signal Corps during World War II, assigned to General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s staff, in charge of non-combat radio communications in the European theater. Now, he proposed to apply his knowledge of complex radio networks to the situation in Los Angeles.

Sigmon developed a specialized radio receiver and reel-to-reel tape recorder. When the receiver picked up a particular tone, it would record the subsequent bulletin. At the time, the device cost about $600 (equivalent to $5,600 in 2018). The LAPD&#x27;s chief, William H. Parker, was interested, though skeptical, warning the inventor, &quot;We&#x27;re going to name this damn thing Sigalert.&quot; More practically, he refused to use it unless the receivers were made available to all Los Angeles radio stations—it could not be a KMPC monopoly.

Initially, half a dozen stations installed Sigmon receivers that had &quot;Sigalert&quot; stamped on their side. When a message had been received and recorded from the LAPD, a red light, sometimes accompanied by a buzzer, would alert the radio stations&#x27; engineers. Depending on the nature of the problem, the engineer could air the police broadcast immediately, interrupting regular programming if necessary.

==Early use==
One of the first major &quot;Sigmon traffic alerts&quot; was broadcast on January 22, 1956, &quot;causing&quot; a traffic jam. The alert described the derailment of a passenger train near Los Angeles&#x27; Union Station and requested any available doctors and nurses to respond to the scene. Too many doctors, nurses and sightseers drove there, making the situation worse. The first SigAlert was on Labor Day weekend in 1955, and some stories on the SigAlert conflate these two events.

At first, the LAPD issued about one alert a day, but soon other agencies were calling in messages they wanted broadcast, including rabid dog reports, gas leaks and even a ship collision in Los Angeles Harbor. A pharmacist who had made a potentially fatal error in filling a prescription took advantage of the system to warn the customer (who heard the SigAlert in time). It was also used to warn about the impending Baldwin Hills Dam collapse in 1963.

The term &quot;Sigalert&quot; was also used in Seattle, Washington in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

==Since 1969==
In 1969, when the CHP assumed responsibility for freeway traffic from the LAPD, it took control of the SigAlert system as well. It is now used throughout California and limited to traffic situations only. Messages are still broadcast, but most radio stations now read the information from the CHP&#x27;s web service rather than rebroadcasting the police dispatchers&#x27; voices. 

CalTrans also uses the term &quot;Sig-Alert&quot;, and it has now come to be commonly defined as any traffic incident that will tie up two or more lanes of a freeway for two or more hours.

 not all California radio stations use this term. For example, radio station KABC uses the term &quot;KABC Traffic Alert&quot;, while radio stations KNX, KFI-AM, KRLA, KQED, and KCRW use the original term.

<text>Peterlee is a town in County Durham, England. It is located south of Sunderland, north of Hartlepool, west of the Durham Coast and east of Durham. It gained town status in 1948 under the New Towns Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. 68). The act also created the nearby settlement of Newton Aycliffe and later Washington, Tyne and Wear.

==History==
The case for founding Peterlee was put forward in &quot;Farewell Squalor&quot; by Easington Rural District Council Surveyor C. W. Clarke, who also proposed that the town be named after celebrated Durham miners&#x27; leader Peter Lee. It is one of the few places in the British Isles named after a recent individual, and unique among post-Second World War new towns in having its existence requested by local people through their MP. A deputation, consisting mostly of working miners, met the Minister of Town and Country Planning to put the case for a new town in the district. The minister, Lewis Silkin, responded by offering a half-size new town of 30,000 residents. The subsequent new residents came largely from surrounding villages in the District of Easington.

Peterlee Development Corporation was founded in 1948, first under Dr Monica Felton, then under A.V. Williams. The original master plan for tower blocks of flats by Berthold Lubetkin was rejected as unsuitable for the area&#x27;s geology, which had been weakened by mining works, and Lubetkin resigned in 1950. George Grenfell Baines&#x27; plan was accepted, and construction quickly began, but it was of poor quality. Williams invited artist Victor Pasmore to head the landscaping design team.

==Governance==
Peterlee is a civil parish and has a Town Council. Peterlee is under Durham County Council, the unitary authority elected to govern County Durham.

===Mayor===
Peterlee&#x27;s first elected mayor was William Whitehouse, who previously served on its council. Earlier he was in the Royal Air Force and taught at a school in Horden.

==Landmarks==
===Apollo Pavilion===
The Apollo Pavilion (1970) was designed by Victor Pasmore. It provided a focal point for the Sunny Blunts estate as well as a bridge across a water-course. It was named after the Apollo Moon missions.

From the late 1970s the Pavilion suffered from vandals and antisocial behaviour. The murals on the building faded, and to discourage antisocial behaviour, staircases were removed in the 1980s. In 1996, there was a failed attempt to list the Pavilion. English Heritage described it as &quot;an internationally important masterpiece&quot;; however, some local residents and councillors considered it an eyesore and campaigned to have it demolished. The campaign seemed to have been successful when demolition was proposed in 2000. However, in July 2009, a six-month revamp programme was completed at a cost of £400,000, which includes reinstating the original murals and stairs.

In December 2011, English Heritage gave the pavilion a Grade-II* listing.

==Transport==
===Road===
Peterlee is served by the main A19 road running west of the town to Sunderland in the north and Hartlepool in the south, and the A1086 to its east leading to Easington in the north and Hartlepool to the south. The B1320 runs through the town centre linking the town to Horden and the A1086 in the east and Shotton Colliery and the A19 in the west. The B1432 to the north of the town centre leads to Easington Village, Hawthorn and Seaham on the route of the old A19. The A181 runs to the south-west of the town at the Castle Eden and Wingate junction on the A19 leading to Wheatley Hill, Thornley, and Durham. In 2008, the A688 was extended to the A181 at Running Waters from the A1(M) junction at Bowburn, creating a trunk road from Peterlee to the A1(M) via the A19, A181 and A688.

===Buses===
Peterlee is served by Arriva North East and Go North East in the local area, to Dalton Park, and to the towns and cities of Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, Houghton-le-Spring, Durham, Hartlepool, Sedgefield, Newton Aycliffe, Billingham, Stockton, Middlesbrough and Darlington.

===Rail===
Peterlee is served by , approximately east, on the Durham Coast Line. This station, which opened on 29 June 2020, replaced Horden&#x27;s earlier station which closed in May 1964. Until 1952, there had also been a station approximately west in Shotton Colliery called &quot;&quot;.

==Education==
===Secondary===
*Dene Academy
*The Academy at Shotton Hall
*St Bede&#x27;s Catholic School

==Culture==
*Castle Eden Dene, most of which is within the boundaries of Peterlee, is a national nature reserve.

==Town twinning==

<text>The crested lark (Galerida cristata) is a species of lark widespread across Eurasia and northern Africa. It is a non-migratory bird, but can occasionally be found as a vagrant in Great Britain.
==Taxonomy and systematics==
The crested lark was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. It was classified in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot; until German naturalist Friedrich Boie placed it in the new genus &quot;Galerida&quot; in 1821. Colin Harrison recommended lumping members of &quot;Galerida&quot; and &quot;Lullula&quot; back into &quot;Alauda&quot; in 1865 due to a lack of defining characteristics. The current scientific name is derived from Latin. &quot;Galerida&quot; was the name for a lark with a crest, from &quot;&quot;, &quot;cap&quot;, and &quot;&quot; means &quot;crested&quot;. Alban Guillaumet and colleagues noted the distinctiveness of populations from the Maghreb—birds in the dryer parts of Morocco and Tunisia had longer bills while those in more coastal northern parts had shorter bills typical of the European subspecies. The authors sampled the mitochondrial DNA and found they were distinct genetically.

Formerly, the Maghreb lark was considered as a subspecies of the crested lark.

=== Subspecies ===
Thirty-three subspecies are recognized:

==Description==
A fairly small lark, the crested lark is roughly the same size as a Eurasian skylark, but shorter overall and bulkier around the head and body, and very similar in appearance, with a height of and a wingspan of , weighing between . It is a small, brown bird which has a short tail with light brown outer feathers. Male and females have no real differences, but young crested larks have more spots on their back than their older counterparts. Its plumage is downy but sparse and appears whitish. The distinct crest from which the crested lark gets its name is conspicuous at all times but is more pronounced during territorial or courtship displays and when singing. In flight it shows reddish underwings. It shares many characteristics with the Thekla lark, with the main distinctions between the two being the beak, the Thekla&#x27;s heavier black-brown streaks and its grey underwing, present in European specimens.

==Distribution and habitat==

The crested lark breeds across most of temperate Eurasia from Portugal to north-eastern China and eastern India, and in Africa south to Niger. It is non-migratory, and the sedentary nature of this species is illustrated by the fact that it is only a very rare vagrant to Great Britain, despite breeding as close as northern France. While the bird is not commonly found in Scandinavia today, it could be found in Sweden until the 1990s, with sources reporting six individual birds in 1992 before becoming extirpated in Sweden in 1993. The birds have also been extirpated in several other European countries, including Norway (1972), Luxembourg (1973) and Switzerland (1980s).

This is a common bird of dry, open country and is often seen by roadsides or in cereal fields, although it is also found occupying small, sandy patches by railways, docks and airfields.

==Behaviour==

The crested lark is a songbird, and has a liquid, warbling song described onomatopoeically as a &#x27; or a &#x27;. It sings in flight from high in the sky, at roughly above the ground. The related Eurasian skylark exhibits similar behaviour but also sings during its ascent, whereas the crested lark sings either at altitude or on the ground. Their flight pattern is an example of undulatory locomotion.

===Breeding===

It nests in small depressions in the ground, often in wastelands and on the outskirts of towns. The nests are untidy structures composed primarily of dead grasses and roots. Three to five brown, finely speckled eggs, similar to those of the Eurasian skylark, are laid at a time and will hatch after . As with most larks, the chicks leave the nest early, after about eight days, and take flight after reaching old. Two broods will usually be raised each year.

===Food and feeding===

Largely vegetarian birds, crested larks primarily feed on grains and seeds, such as oats, wheat and barley, but will also eat insects, particularly beetles, with food either being scavenged from the ground or dug up. Juvenile birds are fed by both parents, and generally leave the nest before they are able to fly to start foraging for food themselves.

==Relationship to humans==
Francis of Assisi considered the crested lark a bird of special significance, based on similarities he perceived between it and the life of the Friars Minor: its plain earth-coloured plumage and hood, its humility (&quot;for it goes willingly along the wayside and finds a grain of corn for itself&quot;), and its time spent in song.

==Status==
The crested lark has been categorised by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as being of least concern, meaning that it is not currently threatened with extinction. Estimates for the global population of mature individuals of the species range from 22,000,000 to 91,200,000. Figures for Europe are less varied, with estimates putting the number of breeding pairs at between 3,600,000 and 7,600,000, or between 7,200,000 and 15,200,000 individuals. In Europe, trends since 1982 have shown an overall decline in the population of the species, resulting in the assumption that the crested lark is in decline globally.

<text>Loyd C. Sigmon (May 6, 1909 – June 2, 2004) was an American radio broadcaster, best known as the creator and namesake of Sig Alert.

== Early life ==
Sigmon was born in Stigler, Oklahoma to a cattle-ranching family. He soon became interested in radio, earning his amateur (&quot;ham&quot;) radio license at age 14. His broadcasting career began in 1932 at the Boston Short Wave and Television Laboratories. In 1941 he was hired as an engineer for MacMillan Petroleum Company&#x27;s flagship radio station, KMPC, in Los Angeles, California. That job was interrupted by World War II; he served in the United States Army Signal Corps on General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s staff.

== Career ==
Sigmon resumed his job in Los Angeles after the war, rising to the position of Executive Vice President with Gene Autry&#x27;s Golden West Broadcasters, which owned eight radio and two television stations on the west coast, including KMPC.

In 1955, Sigmon invented a specialized radio and tape recorder that the Los Angeles Police Department used to alert radio stations throughout the city to traffic conditions and emergencies. The messages were referred to as &quot;Sigmon traffic alerts,&quot; a phrase quickly shortened to &quot;Sig Alert.&quot; The system, now employed throughout California, has been copied in numerous other areas. For this, Bill Keene called him the &quot;father of L.A. traffic reporting&quot;.

Loyd Sigmon received recognition and honors from local and state government agencies, the National Safety Council, and broadcasting and radio organizations. In 1998, when the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the California Highway Patrol opened their Freeway Traffic Center in Los Angeles, Sigmon attended as their special Guest of Honor. He was quoted in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as saying, &quot;I ran a multimillion-dollar corporation, but it&#x27;s the Sig Alert that people remember me for.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Sigmon and his wife Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Lee had a home in Palm Springs, California in the late 1950s.

Sigmon kept his amateur radio license, W6LQ, current even after retiring to Oklahoma. Sigmon died in an assisted living facility in Bartlesville, Oklahoma after suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
