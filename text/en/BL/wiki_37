<text>The Eiger () is a mountain of the Bernese Alps, overlooking Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland, just north of the main watershed and border with Valais. It is the easternmost peak of a ridge crest that extends across the Mönch to the Jungfrau at , constituting one of the most emblematic sights of the Swiss Alps. While the northern side of the mountain rises more than 3,000 m (10,000 ft) above the two valleys of Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, the southern side faces the large glaciers of the Jungfrau-Aletsch area, the most glaciated region in the Alps. The most notable feature of the Eiger is its nearly north face of rock and ice, named &quot;Eiger-Nordwand&quot;, &quot;Eigerwand&quot; or just &quot;Nordwand&quot;, which is the biggest north face in the Alps. This substantial face towers over the resort of Kleine Scheidegg at its base, on the eponymous pass connecting the two valleys.

The first ascent of the Eiger was made by Swiss guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren and Irishman Charles Barrington, who climbed the west flank on August 11, 1858. The north face, the &quot;last problem&quot; of the Alps, considered amongst the most challenging and dangerous ascents, was first climbed in 1938 by an Austrian-German expedition. The Eiger has been highly publicized for the many tragedies involving climbing expeditions. Since 1935, at least 64 climbers have died attempting the north face, earning it the German nickname &quot;Mordwand&quot;, literally &quot;murder(ous) wall&quot;—a pun on its correct title of Nordwand (North Wall).

Although the summit of the Eiger can be reached by experienced climbers only, a railway tunnel runs inside the mountain, and two internal stations provide easy access to viewing-windows carved into the rock face. They are both part of the Jungfrau Railway line, running from Kleine Scheidegg to the Jungfraujoch, between the Mönch and the Jungfrau, at the highest railway station in Europe. The two stations within the Eiger are Eigerwand (behind the north face) and Eismeer (behind the south face), at around 3,000 metres. The Eigerwand station has not been regularly served since 2016.

==Etymology==
The first mention of Eiger, appearing as &quot;mons Egere&quot;, was found in a property sale document of 1252, but there is no clear indication of how exactly the peak gained its name. The three mountains of the ridge are commonly referred to as the Virgin (German: &quot;Jungfrau&quot; – translates to &quot;virgin&quot; or &quot;maiden&quot;), the Monk (&quot;Mönch&quot;), and the Ogre (&quot;Eiger&quot;; the standard German word for ogre is &quot;Oger&quot;). The name has been linked to the Latin term &quot;acer&quot;, meaning &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;pointed&quot;.

==Geographic setting and description==

The Eiger is located above the Lauterbrunnen Valley to the west and Grindelwald to the north in the Bernese Oberland region of the canton of Bern. It forms a renowned mountain range of the Bernese Alps together with its two companions: the Jungfrau () about southwest of it and the Mönch () about in the middle of them. The nearest settlements are Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen () and Wengen (). The Eiger has three faces: north (or more precisely NNW), east (or more precisely ESE), and west (or more precisely WSW). The northeastern ridge from the summit to the Ostegg (lit.: &quot;eastern corner&quot;, ), called &quot;Mittellegi&quot;, is the longest on the Eiger. The north face overlooks the gently rising Alpine meadow between Grindelwald () and Kleine Scheidegg (), a mountain railways junction and a pass, which can be reached from both sides, Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen/Wengen – by foot or train.

Politically, the Eiger (and its summit) belongs to the Bernese municipalities of Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen. The Kleine Scheidegg (literally, &quot;the small parting corner&quot;) connects the Männlichen-Tschuggen range with the western ridge of the Eiger. The Eiger does not properly form part of the main chain of the Bernese Alps, which borders the canton of Valais and forms the watershed between the Rhine and the Rhône, but constitutes a massive limestone buttress, projecting from the crystalline basement of the Mönch across the Eigerjoch. Consequently, all sides of the Eiger feed finally the same river, namely the Lütschine.

Eiger&#x27;s water is connected through the &quot;Weisse Lütschine&quot; (the white one) in the Lauterbrunnen Valley on the west side (southwestern face of the Eiger) and through the &quot;Schwarze Lütschine&quot; (the black one) running through Grindelwald (northwestern face), which meet each other in Zweilütschinen (lit.: &quot;the two Lütschinen&quot;) where they form the proper Lütschine. The east face is covered by the glacier called Ischmeer (Bernese German for &quot;Ice Sea&quot;), which forms one upper part of the fast-retreating Lower Grindelwald Glacier. These glaciers&#x27; water forms a short creek, which is also confusingly called the &quot;Weisse Lütschine&quot;, but enters the black one already in Grindelwald together with the water from the Upper Grindelwald Glacier. Therefore, all the water running down the Eiger converges at the northern foot of the Männlichen () in Zweilütschinen (), about northwest of the summit, where the Lütschine begins its northern course to Lake Brienz and the Aare (). 

Although the Eiger&#x27;s north face is almost ice-free, significant glaciers lie on the other sides of the mountain. The Eiger Glacier flows on the southwestern side of the Eiger, from the crest connecting it to the Mönch down to , south of Eigergletscher railway station, and feeds the Weisse Lütschine through the Trümmelbach. On the east side, the Ischmeer–well visible from the windows of Eismeer railway station–flows eastwards from the same crest then turns to the north below the impressive wide &quot;Fiescherwand&quot;, the north face of the Fiescherhörner triple summit () down to about of the Lower Grindelwald Glacier system.

The massive composition of the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau constitutes a symbolic sight of the Swiss Alps and is visible from many places on the Swiss Plateau and the Jura Mountains in the northwest. The higher Finsteraarhorn () and Aletschhorn (), which are located about to the south, are generally less visible and situated in the middle of glaciers in less accessible areas. As opposed to the north side, the south and east sides of the range consist of large valley glaciers extending for up to , the largest (beyond the Eiger drainage basin) being those of Grand Aletsch, Fiesch, and Aar Glaciers, and is thus uninhabited. The whole area, the Jungfrau-Aletsch protected area, comprising the highest summits and largest glaciers of the Bernese Alps, was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001.

In July 2006, a piece of the Eiger fell from the east face, amounting to approximately 700,000 cubic metres of rock. As it had been noticeably cleaving for several weeks and fell into an uninhabited area, no injuries or buildings were hit.

==North face ==

The &quot;Nordwand&quot;, German for &quot;north wall&quot; or &quot;north face&quot;, is the north face of the Eiger (also known as the &quot;Eigernordwand&quot;: &quot;Eiger north wall&quot; or &quot;Eigerwand&quot;). It is one of the three great north faces of the Alps, along with the north faces of the Matterhorn and the Grandes Jorasses (known as &#x27;the Trilogy&#x27;) and also one of the biggest sheer faces in Europe, between 1,600 m and 1,800 m (over a mile) high. The face overlooks Kleine Scheidegg and the valley of Grindelwald. At 2,866 metres inside the mountain lies the Eigerwand railway station. The station is connected to the north face by a tunnel opening at the face, which has sometimes been used to rescue climbers. The Eiger Trail, at the base of the north face, runs from Eigergletscher to Alpiglen railway stations. The approach hike to the base of the face takes less than an hour from Eigergletscher.
Some of the notable features on the north face are (from the bottom): First Pillar, Eigerwand Station, First Ice-field, Hinterstoisser Traverse, Swallow&#x27;s Nest, Ice Hose, Second Ice-field, Death Bivouac, Ramp, Traverse of the Gods, Spider and Exit Cracks.

In 1938, &quot;Alpine Journal&quot; editor Edward Lisle Strutt called the face &quot;an obsession for the mentally deranged&quot; and &quot;the most imbecile variant since mountaineering first began.&quot; In the same year, however, the north face was finally climbed on 24 July by Andreas Heckmair, Ludwig Vörg, Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek, a German–Austrian group.

A portion of the upper face is called &quot;The White Spider&quot;, as snow-filled cracks radiating from an ice field resemble the legs of a spider. Harrer used this name for the title of his book about his successful climb, &quot;Die Weisse Spinne&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The White Spider: The Classic Account of the Ascent of the Eiger&quot;). During the first successful ascent, the four men were caught in an avalanche as they climbed the Spider, but all had enough strength to resist being swept off the face.

Since then, the north face has been climbed many times. Today, it is regarded as a formidable challenge, not only because of its technical difficulties, exceeding those of some of the 8,000 m peaks in the Himalaya and Karakoram but also because of the increased rockfall and diminishing ice-fields. Climbers are increasingly electing to challenge the Eiger in winter when the crumbling face is strengthened by ice.

Since 1935, at least sixty-four climbers have died attempting the north face, earning it the German nickname, &quot;Mordwand&quot;, or &quot;murderous wall&quot;, a play on the face&#x27;s German name &quot;Nordwand&quot;.

==Climbing history==
While the summit was reached without much difficulty in 1858 by a complex route on the west flank, the battle to climb the north face has captivated the interest of climbers and non-climbers alike. Before it was successfully climbed, most of the attempts on the face ended tragically, and the Bernese authorities even banned climbing it and threatened to fine any party that should attempt it again. However, the enthusiasm that animated the young talented climbers from Austria and Germany finally vanquished its reputation of unclimbability when a party of four climbers successfully reached the summit in 1938 by what is known as the &quot;1938&quot; or &quot;Heckmair&quot; route.

The climbers that attempted the north face could be easily watched through the telescopes from the Kleine Scheidegg, a pass between Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, connected by rail. The contrast between the comfort and civilization of the railway station and the agonies of the young men slowly dying a short yet uncrossable distance away led to intensive coverage by the international media.

After World War II, the north face was climbed twice in 1947, first by a party of two French guides, Louis Lachenal and Lionel Terray, then by a Swiss party consisting of H. Germann, with Hans and Karl Schlunegger.

===First ascent===
In 1857, the first recorded attempt was made by Christian Almer, Christian Kaufmann, Ulrich Kaufmann guiding the Austrian alpinist Sigismund Porges. They did manage the first ascent of neighboring Mönch instead. Porges, however, successfully made the second ascent of the Eiger in July 1861 with the guides Christian Michel, Hans, and Peter Baumann.

The first ascent was made by the western flank on August 11, 1858, by Charles Barrington with guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren. On the previous afternoon, the party walked up to the Wengernalp hotel. From there, they started the ascent of the Eiger at 3:30 a.m. Barrington describes the route much as it is followed today, staying close to the edge of the north face much of the way. They reached the summit at about noon, planted a flag, remained for 10 minutes, and descended in about four hours. Barrington describes reaching the top, saying, &quot;The two guides kindly gave me the place of the first man up.&quot; After the descent, the party was escorted to the Kleine Scheidegg hotel, where their ascent was confirmed by observation of the flag left on the summit. The hotel owner then fired a cannon to celebrate the first ascent. According to Harrer&#x27;s &quot;The White Spider&quot;, Barrington was originally planning to make the first ascent of the Matterhorn, but his finances did not allow him to travel there as he was already staying in the Eiger region.

===Mittellegi ridge===

Although the Mittellegi ridge had already been descended by climbers (since 1885) with ropes in the difficult sections, it remained unclimbed until 1921. On the 10th of September of that year, Japanese climber Yuko Maki, along with Swiss guides Fritz Amatter, Samuel Brawand, and Fritz Steuri, made the first successful ascent of the ridge. The previous day, the party approached the ridge from the Eismeer railway station of the Jungfrau Railway and bivouacked for the night. They started the climb at about 6:00 a.m. and reached the summit of the Eiger at about 7:15 p.m., after an over 13 hours gruelling ascent. Shortly after, they descended the west flank. They finally reached Eigergletscher railway station at about 3:00 a.m. the next day.

===Attempts on the north face===
====1935====
In 1935, two young German climbers from Bavaria, Karl Mehringer and Max Sedlmeyer, arrived at Grindelwald to attempt the ascent of the north face. After waiting some time for the weather to improve, they set off, reaching the height of the Eigerwand station before stopping for their first bivouac. The following day, facing greater difficulties, they gained little height. On the third day, they made hardly any vertical gain. That night, the weather deteriorated, bringing snow and low clouds that shrouded the mountain from the observers below. Avalanches began to sweep the face. Two days later, the weather briefly cleared, and the two men were glimpsed a little higher and about to bivouac for the fifth night before clouds descended again. A few days later, the weather finally cleared, revealing a completely white north face. Weeks later, the German World War I ace Ernst Udet went searching for the missing men with his aircraft, eventually spotting one of them frozen to death in what became known as the &quot;Death Bivouac&quot;. Sedlmeyer&#x27;s body was found at the foot of the face the following year by his brothers Heinrich and Martin Meier, who were part of a group looking for the victims of the 1936 climbing disaster. Mehringer&#x27;s remains were found in 1962 by Swiss climbers below the &quot;Flat Iron&quot; (&quot;Bügeleisen&quot;) at the lefthand end of the second ice field.

====1936====
Ten young climbers from Austria and Germany came to Grindelwald and camped at the foot of the mountain the following year. Before their attempts started, one of them was killed during a training climb, and the weather was so bad during that summer that, after waiting for a change and seeing none on the way, several members of the party gave up. Of the four that remained, two were Bavarians, Andreas Hinterstoisser and Toni Kurz, and two were Austrians, Willy Angerer and Edi Rainer. When the weather improved, they preliminarily explored the lowest part of the face. Hinterstoisser fell but was not injured. A few days later, the four men finally began the ascent of the face. They climbed quickly, but on the next day, after their first bivouac, the weather changed; clouds came down and hid the group from the observers. They did not resume the climb until the following day, when, during a break, the party was seen descending, but the climbers could be seen only intermittently from the ground. The group had no choice but to retreat since Angerer had suffered serious injuries from falling rock. The party became stuck on the face when they could not recross the difficult Hinterstoisser Traverse, from which they had taken the rope they had first used to climb it. The weather then deteriorated for two days. They were ultimately swept away by an avalanche, which only Kurz survived, hanging on a rope. Three guides started on a precarious rescue attempt. They failed to reach him but came within shouting distance and learned what had happened. Kurz explained the fate of his companions: one had fallen down the face, another was frozen above him, and the third had fractured his skull in falling and was hanging dead on the rope.

In the morning, the three guides returned, traversing the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under constant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, with one hand and one arm wholly frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the rope that bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides could not pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They gave him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers, who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another&#x27;s shoulders, could touch the tip of Kurz&#x27;s crampons with his ice axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, wholly exhausted, died slowly.

====1937====
An attempt was made in 1937 by and Ludwig Vörg. Although the effort was unsuccessful, they were nonetheless the first climbers who returned alive from a serious attempt on the face. They started the climb on 11 August and reached a high point of a few rope lengths above Death Bivouac. A storm broke, and after three days on the wall, they had to retreat. This was the first successful withdrawal from a significant height on the wall.

===First ascent of the north face===

The north face was first climbed on July 24, 1938, by Anderl Heckmair, Ludwig Vörg, Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek in a German–Austrian party. The party had initially consisted of two independent teams: Harrer (who did not have a pair of crampons on the climb) and Kasparek were joined on the face by Heckmair and Vörg, who had started their ascent a day later and had been helped by the fixed rope that the lead team had left across the Hinterstoisser Traverse. The two groups, led by the experienced Heckmair, decided to join their forces and roped together as a single group of four. Heckmair later wrote: &quot;We, the sons of the older Reich, united with our companions from the Eastern Border to march together to victory.&quot;

Snow avalanches constantly threatened the expedition. They climbed as quickly as possible between the falls. On the third day, a storm broke, and the cold was intense. The four men were caught in an avalanche as they climbed &quot;the Spider&quot;, the snow-filled cracks radiating from an ice-field on the upper face, but all possessed sufficient strength to resist being swept off the face. The members successfully reached the summit at four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. They were so exhausted that they only had the strength to descend by the regular route through a raging blizzard.

<text>Édouard Daladier (; 18 June 1884 – 10 October 1970) was a French Radical-Socialist (centre-left) politician, and the Prime Minister of France who signed the Munich Agreement before the outbreak of World War II.

Daladier was born in Carpentras and began his political career before World War I. During the war, he fought on the Western Front and was decorated for his service. After the war, he became a leading figure in the Radical Party and Prime Minister in 1933 and 1934. Daladier was Minister of Defence from 1936 to 1940 and Prime Minister again in 1938. As head of government, he expanded the French welfare state in 1939.

Along with Neville Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, Daladier signed the Munich Agreement in 1938, which gave Nazi Germany control over the Sudetenland. After Hitler&#x27;s invasion of Poland in 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany. During the Phoney War, France&#x27;s failure to aid Finland against the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion during the Winter War led to Daladier&#x27;s resignation on 21 March 1940 and his replacement by Paul Reynaud. Daladier remained Minister of Defence until 19 May, when Reynaud took over the portfolio personally after the French defeat at Sedan.

After the Fall of France, Daladier was tried for treason by the Vichy government during the Riom Trial and imprisoned first in Fort du Portalet, then in Buchenwald concentration camp, and finally in Itter Castle. After the Battle of Castle Itter, Daladier resumed his political career as a member of the French Chamber of Deputies from 1946 to 1958. He died in Paris in 1970.

==Early life==
Daladier was born in Carpentras, Vaucluse, on 18 June 1884, the son of a village baker. He received his formal education at the lycée Duparc in Lyon, where he was first introduced to socialist politics. After his graduation, he became a school teacher and a university lecturer at Nîmes, Grenoble and Marseilles and then at the Lycée Condorcet, in Paris, where he taught history. He began his political career by becoming the mayor of Carpentras, his home town, in 1912. He subsequently sought election to the Paris Chamber of Deputies but lost to a Radical-Socialist Party candidate; he later joined that party.

Daladier had received military training before the war under France&#x27;s conscription system. In August 1914, he was mobilised at the age of 30 with the French Army&#x27;s 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment when World War I started with the rank of sergeant. In mid-1915, the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment was destroyed in heavy fighting against the Imperial German Army on the Western Front. The surviving remnant of it was assigned to other units, Daladier being transferred into the 209th Infantry Regiment. In 1916, he fought with the 209th in the Battle of Verdun and was given a field commission as a lieutenant in the midst of the battle in April 1916 having received commendations for gallantry in action. In May 1917, he received the Legion of Honour for gallantry in action and ended the war as a captain leading a company. He had also been awarded the Croix de Guerre.

After his demobilisation, he was elected to the Paris Chamber of Deputies for Orange, Vaucluse, in 1919.

Later, he would become known to many as &quot;the bull of Vaucluse&quot; because of his thick neck, large shoulders and determined look. However, cynics also quipped that his horns were like those of a snail.

==Interwar period==

After he entered the Chamber of Deputies, Daladier became a leading member of the Radical-Socialist Party and was responsible for building it into a structured modern political party. For most of the interwar period, he was the chief figure of the party&#x27;s left wing, supporters of a governmental coalition with the socialist Section française de l&#x27;Internationale ouvrière (SFIO). A government minister in various posts during the coalition governments between 1924 and 1928, Daladier was instrumental in the Radical-Socialists&#x27; break with the SFIO in 1926, the first &quot;Cartel des gauches&quot; with the centre-right Raymond Poincaré in November 1928. In 1930, he unsuccessfully attempted to gain socialist support for a centre-left government in coalition the Radical-Socialist and similar parties. In 1933, despite similar negotiations breaking down, he formed a government of the republican left.

In January 1934, he was considered the most likely candidate of the centre-left to form a government of sufficient honesty to calm public opinion after the revelations of the Stavisky Affair, a major corruption scandal. The government lasted less than a week, however, since it fell in the face of the 6 February 1934 riots. After Daladier fell, the coalition of the left initiated two years of right-wing governments.

After a year of being withdrawn from frontline politics, Daladier returned to public prominence in October 1934 and took a populist line against the banking oligarchy that he believed had taken control of French democracy: the Two Hundred Families. He was made president of the Radical-Socialist Party and brought the party into the Popular Front coalition. Daladier became Minister of National Defence in the Léon Blum government and retained the crucial portfolio for two years. Besides for serving as Defence Minister, Daladier was appointed the chairman of the newly founded Supreme Defence Committee. At the first meeting of the committee on 26 June 1936, Daladier complained that other nations had someone to direct their defence policies, citing the example of the War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg in Germany; the Defence Commissar Marshal Kliment Voroshilov in the Soviet Union; Benito Mussolini in Italy and Sir Thomas Inskip in Britain. Daladier stated from now on he would be playing that role in France. He then moved on to say that the first order of business was the nationalisation of the entire French arms industry as he accused French arms firms of failing to provide the military with the necessary weapons on time or in full, and stated that henceforward the French state would take direct control of all production. Daladier had a difficult relationship with Marshal Maxime Weygand-a man whom he greatly disliked-but Daladier was very close to Weygand&#x27;s successor, Maurice Gamelin, whose views and judgements on military matters he greatly trusted and valued.

Daladier was much influenced by intelligence reports from the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; that the factories of the German arms firms such as Krupp AG, Rheinmetall AG, and Borsig AG were being run at full capacity, suggesting that the &quot;Reich&quot; was preparing for war in the near-future. Daladier complained that Germany as the world&#x27;s second largest economy had an automatic head-start in the arms race while France as the world&#x27;s fourth largest economy was by definition behind the &quot;Reich&quot; in terms of arms production. In early July 1936, Daladier appeared by the Defence Committees of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate to warn that Germany was winning the arms race; the Wehrmacht would soon field 650,000 men; and that the Wehrmacht was buying tanks in massive numbers to win a &quot;war of movement&quot;. Gamelin expressed much concern to Robert Jacomet, a senior civil servant at the Defence Ministry about the plans for nationalization of the arms industry, which he described as a &quot;left-wing gimmick&quot; instead of being a practical policy to win the arms race. Jacoment replied that Daladier was all for nationalization as he stated that &quot;Time is short&quot; and to create a &quot;powerful parallel state industry&quot; alongside the private sector arms industry would take too long. Jacoment stated: &quot;Our interest is therefore to get our hands on the existing factories and modernise them fast&quot;. On 11 August 1936, the nationalization bill was approved by the National Assembly, and the French state took control of the arms industry.

As Defence Minister, Daladier asked the commander of the military, General Maurice Gamelin to submit a four-year plan for military modernization. When Gamelin submitted in a plan that was budgeted at 9 billion francs for the French Army, Daladier rejected it as too low and instead added in an extra 5 billion francs. During an &quot;emotional&quot; interview with Blum, Daladier persuaded him to accept the 14 billion franc plan as he issued a stark warning that the &quot;Reich&quot; was winning the arms race at present. On 7 September 1936, the Blum cabinet approved Daladier&#x27;s 14 billion franc plan for rearmament. The American historian Joseph Maiolo wrote the rearmament program launched in 1936 was &quot;the biggest arms program ever attempted by a French government in peacetime&quot;. As Defence Minister, Daladier favoured a hawkish line towards Italy, and in January 1937 played a crucial role in having Admiral François Darlan appointed commander of the Navy as Darlan saw Italy as France&#x27;s primary opponent unlike his predecessor Admiral Georges Durand-Viel who was an admirer of Fascist Italy. The French Navy was not large enough to patrol both the Atlantic coastline and the Mediterranean Sea.

A key element in France&#x27;s war plans against Germany was bringing in a massive number of soldiers from North Africa to France, and the prospect that Italy would cut the sea lanes linking Algeria to France was considered a major problem in Paris. Darlan argued that France needed control of the Mediterranean not because of the need for troops from Algeria, but because it was the only way for France to reach its allies in Eastern Europe and for reasons of trade. In the debate between Darlan vs. Maurice Gamelin who saw Italy more as a potential ally rather a potential enemy, Daladier came to favour Darlan. The Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War along with Benito Mussolini&#x27;s openly pro-German foreign policy convinced Daladier by late 1937 that Italy was only a potential enemy and it should be assumed that France became involved in a war with Germany that Italy would inevitably enter the war on the side of the &quot;Reich&quot;. At a meeting of &quot;Comité Permeant de la Défense National&quot; in November 1937, Daladier stated: &quot;The hypothesis of conflict with the Mediterranean as the center of preponderant action, raises different problems for our foreign and military policy...Given the two-bloc composition [in the Atlantic and Asia] of the Franco-British empire, an attack in the Mediterranean, the stem between these two blocs would allow Germany and Italy to obtain the most decisive results&quot;. In addition, Daladier noted that the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez canal was equally important to the British as almost all of the shipping that linked the United Kingdom to its colonies in Asia went through the Mediterranean, and the possibility of a potential Italian naval threat was the best way of securing an alliance with Britain. Daladier pushed for war planning that called for making the defeat of Italy the first priority while France remained on the defensive against the &quot;Reich&quot; along the Maginot Line.

After the fall of the Blum government, Daladier became head of government again on 10 April 1938, orienting his government towards the centre and ending the Popular Front.

===Munich Agreement===

Daladier&#x27;s last government was in power at the time of the negotiations preceding the Munich Agreement during which France pressured Czechoslovakia to hand the Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. In April–May 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain strongly but unsuccessfully pressed Daladier to renounce the French-Czechoslovak alliance, which led to Britain becoming involved in the crisis. From the British perspective, the problem was not the Sudetenland but the French-Czechoslovak alliance. British military experts were almost unanimous that Germany would defeat France in a war unless Britain intervened. The British thought that allowing Germany to defeat France would unacceptably alter the balance of power, and so Britain would have no choice but to intervene if a French-German war broke out. The Franco-Czechoslovak alliance would have turned any German attack on Czechoslovakia into a French–German war. As British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax stated at a Cabinet meeting in March 1938, &quot;Whether we liked or not, we had to admit the plain fact that we could not afford to see France overrun.&quot; At the Anglo-French summit in London on 28–29 April 1938, Chamberlain pressured Daladier to renounce the alliance with Czechoslovakia, only to be firmly informed that France would stand by its obligations, which forced the British to be involved very reluctantly in the Sudetenland Crisis. The summit of 28–29 April 1938 represented a British &quot;surrender&quot; to the French, rather than a French &quot;surrender&quot; to the British since Daladier made it clear France would not renounce its alliance with Czechoslovakia. Daladier&#x27;s unwillingness to renounce France&#x27;s alliance with Czechoslovakia forced the British very much against their will into involvement with the Sudetenland crisis since because the French refused to renounce the alliance led to the British taking the next best course of action, namely pressuring Czechoslovakia into concessions to the Sudeten Germans.

Unlike Chamberlain, Daladier had no illusions about Hitler&#x27;s ultimate goals. In fact, he told the British in a late April 1938 meeting that Hitler&#x27;s real aim was to eventually secure &quot;a domination of the Continent in comparison with which the ambitions of Napoleon were feeble&quot;. Daladier went on to say, &quot;Today, it is the turn of Czechoslovakia. Tomorrow, it will be the turn of Poland and Romania. When Germany has obtained the oil and wheat it needs, she will turn on the West. Certainly we must multiply our efforts to avoid war. But that will not be obtained unless Great Britain and France stick together, intervening in Prague for new concessions [i.e. to the Sudeten Germans] but declaring at the same time that they will safeguard the independence of Czechoslovakia. If, on the contrary, the Western Powers capitulate again, they will only precipitate the war they wish to avoid.&quot; At the same time, Daladier was well aware that France could not hope to win a war against Germany without the &quot;continental commitment&quot; that the British Empire would commit a large expeditionary force to the defence of France as had occurred in World War I. Furthermore, 60% of French imports came via the sea, making France dependent upon help from Britain, the world&#x27;s largest naval power. The way that Italy came to be aligned with Germany from 1936 onward led to the majority of the French Navy being concentrated in the Mediterranean Sea to face a potential threat from Italy, leaving the French Atlantic coastline wide open to the German Navy, which led France to seek Britain as an ally to protect the Atlantic sea-lanes. The greater population of Germany left the French dependent upon bringing soldiers recruited in Algeria to France, and which in turn made the French Navy&#x27;s primary task was in securing control of the western Mediterranean. Daladier had pushed very strongly during the London summit for Anglo-French naval staff talks for a possible war against Italy as he argued that both Britain and France needed command of the Mediterranean. Daladier had pressed Chamberlain for the Royal Navy to abandon the Singapore strategy of sending the main British battle fleet to Singapore to defend Britain&#x27;s Asian colonies against a Japanese threat and instead wanted the Royal Navy concentrated in European waters.

The French economic situation was very worrying since the French franc had been devalued on 4 May 1938 for the third time since October 1936. Daladier wanted to stabilise the franc and so had fixed the exchange rate to 176 francs per pound sterling. The crisis of 20–22 May 1938 made the franc come under immense financial pressure since many investors did not wish to hold French assets or debts if France went to war. Jacques Rueff, the director of &quot;direction générale du mouvement des fonds&quot; and special adviser to Finance Minister, Paul Marchandeau, stated in a report that the government must cut defence spending or find more sources of short-term loans, as the French government was running out of money. Marchandeau stated that ordinary charges upon the treasury in 1938 would &quot;exceed&quot; 42 billion francs, and Rueff warned that France would go bankrupt once the legal limits upon short-term loans from the Bank of France was reached. Marchandeau, in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, stated that the government had only 30 million francs in its account and 230 million francs available from the Bank of France.

As French government expenditure for the month of May 1938 alone totalled 4,500 million francs, the British historian Martin Thomas wrote, &quot;Daladier&#x27;s government was utterly reliant upon the success of its devaluation&quot;. To provide revenue, the government needed to sell more short-term bonds, but investors were highly reluctant to buy French bonds if Germany was threatening Czechoslovakia and put France on the brink of war. Because the franc was tied to the pound, France needed loans from Britain, which were not forthcoming, and so France was left &quot;with its hands tied&quot;. British and American investors were unwilling to buy French bonds as long as the Sudetenland Crisis continued, which caused &quot;severe monetary problems&quot; for the French government in August–September 1938. Only when Daladier moved the &quot;free-market liberal&quot; Paul Reynaud from the Justice Ministry to the Finance Ministry in November 1938 did France regain the confidence of international investors, who resumed buying French bonds.

Reports from the embassy in Warsaw and the legations in Belgrade and Bucharest emphasised that Yugoslavia and Romania would probably do nothing if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, and Poland might very well join in with Germany since the Teschen conflict between Poland and Czechoslovakia had made them bitter enemies. Of France&#x27;s potential allies in Eastern Europe, only the Soviet Union, which had no border with Czechoslovakia, professed a willingness to come to Czechoslovakia&#x27;s aid if Germany invaded, but both Poland and Romania were unwilling to extend transit rights for the Red Army, which presented major problems. Daladier was advised by General Maurice Gamelin that the &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot; which had seen a significant number of the Red Army&#x27;s generals shot on charges of treason for Germany and Japan in 1937-1938 had destroyed the Red Army as an effective fighting force. Daladier was told by the French General Staff that the Red Army was &quot;une belle facade&quot; whose contribution to a war against Germany would be &quot;almost zero&quot;.

On 25 September 1938, at the Bad Godesberg Summit, Hitler rejected Chamberlain&#x27;s offer to have the Sudetenland join Germany in few months, declared that the timeline was unacceptable and that the Sudetenland had to &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; by 1 October, and stated that the Polish and Hungarian claims against Czechoslovakia must also be satisfied by 1 October or Czechoslovakia would be invaded. Upon hearing what Hitler had demanded at the summit, Daladier told his cabinet that France &quot;intended to go to war&quot;.

The next day, Daladier told his close friend, US Ambassador William Christian Bullitt Jr., that he would much prefer war to the &quot;humiliation&quot; of the Bad Godesberg terms.

Daladier ordered the French military to mobilise and to put France on a war footing, with a blackout being imposed at night so that German bombers would be not guided to French cities by the lights. On 26 September, Daladier ordered General Maurice Gamelin to London to begin staff talks with the Imperial General Staff. On 27 September, Gamelin, when asked by his &quot;chef de cabinet&quot; if Daladier was serious about war, replied, &quot;He&#x27;ll do it, he&#x27;ll do it&quot;.

However, on 29 September 1938, Chamberlain announced to the British House of Commons that he just received a phone call from Benito Mussolini, who said that Hitler had reconsidered his views and was now willing to discuss a compromise solution to the crisis in Munich. Ultimately, Daladier felt that France could not win against Germany without Britain on its side, and Chamberlain&#x27;s announcement that he would be flying to Munich led him to attend the Munich Conference as well, which was held the next day on 30 September.

The Munich Agreement was a compromise since Hitler abandoned his more extreme demands such as settling the Polish and Hungarian claims by 1 October, but the conference concluded that Czechoslovakia was to turn over the Sudetenland to Germany within ten days in October and would be supervised by an Anglo-Franco-Italo-German commission. Daladier was happy to have avoided war but felt that the agreement he had signed on 30 September in Munich was a shameful treaty that had betrayed Czechoslovakia, France&#x27;s most loyal ally in Eastern Europe. Although Daladier feared public hostility to the Munich Agreement on his return to Paris, he was acclaimed by the crowd, which cheered the fact that there would not be another war.
Most famously, when he saw the enthusiastic crowds waving at his plane as it landed at Le Bourget Airfield before landing, he turned to his aide Alexis Léger (a.k.a. Saint-John Perse) and commented: &quot;Ah! les cons! s&#x27;ils savaient...&quot; (&quot;Ah! The fools! If only they knew...&quot;).

===Rearmament===
Daladier had been made aware in 1932 by German rivals to Hitler that Krupp manufactured heavy artillery, and the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; had a grasp of the scale of German military preparations but lacked hard intelligence of hostile intentions.

In October 1938, Daladier opened secret talks with the Americans on how to bypass the Neutrality Acts and to allow the French to buy American aircraft to make up for the underproductive French aircraft industry. Daladier commented in October 1938, &quot;If I had three or four thousand aircraft, Munich would never have happened&quot;. He was most anxious to buy American war planes as the only way to strengthen the French Air Force. Major problems in the talks were how the French would pay for the American planes and how to bypass the Neutrality Acts.

In addition, France had defaulted on its World War I debts in 1932 and so fell foul of the 1934 Johnson Act, which banned American loans to nations that had defaulted on their World War I debts. In February 1939, the French offered to cede their possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific, together with a lump sum payment of 10 billion francs, in exchange for the unlimited right to buy American aircraft on credit.

After tortuous negotiations, an arrangement was worked out in the spring of 1939 to allow the French to place huge orders with the American aircraft industry, but as most of the aircraft ordered had not arrived in France by 1940, the Americans arranged for French orders to be diverted to the British.

At a rally in Marseille in October 1938, Daladier announced a new policy: &quot;J&#x27;ai choisi mon chemin: la France en avant!&quot; (&quot;I have chosen my path; forward with France!&quot;). He stated that his government&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies were to be based on &quot;firmness&quot;. What that meant, in practice, was the end of the social reforms of the Popular Front government to increase French productivity, especially by ending the 40-hour work week. In a series of decree laws issued on 1 November 1938 by Finance Minister Paul Reynaud, which bypassed the National Assembly, the 40-hour work week was ended, taxes were sharply increased; social spending was slashed, defence spending was increased, the power of unions was restricted and (most controversially) Saturday was once again declared to be a workday. In a radio broadcast on 12 November 1938, Reynaud stated, &quot;We are going blindfold towards an abyss&quot;. He also argued that however much pain his reforms might cause, they were absolutely necessary. As part of the effort to put the French economy on a war footing, Reynaud increased the military budget from 29 billion francs to 93 billion francs. In response, the French Communist Party called for a general strike to protest the decrees that ended almost all of the reforms of the Popular Front.

The one-day general strike of 30 November 1938, which pitted the government against unions supported by the Communist Party, proved to be the first test of Daladier&#x27;s new policy of &quot;firmness&quot;. Daladier declared a national emergency in response to the general strike, ordered the military to Paris and other major cities, suspended civil liberties, ordered the police to disperse striking workers with tear gas and to storm factories occupied by the workers and announced that any worker who took part in the strike would be fired immediately with no severance pay. After one day, the strike collapsed.

At the time, Daladier justified his policy of &quot;firmness&quot; under the grounds that if France was to face the German challenge, French production would have to be increased and said that was the price of freedom. At the same time, the energetic Colonial Minister Georges Mandel was set about organising the French Colonial Empire for war. He established armament factories in French Indochina to supply the French garrisons there to deter Japan from invading, increased the number of colonial &quot;coloured&quot; divisions from 6 to 12, built defensive works in Tunisia to deter an Italian invasion from Libya and organised the colonial economies for a &quot;total war&quot;. In France itself, Mandel launched a propaganda campaign emphasising how the French colonial Empire was a source of strength under the slogan &quot;110 million strong, France can stand up to Germany&quot; in reference to the fact that the population of Germany was 80 million and that of France was 40 million, with the extra 70 million credited to France being the population of its colonies.

The 40-hour work week was abolished under Daladier&#x27;s government, but a more generous system of family allowances was established and set as a percentage of wages: for the first child 5%, for the second child 10% and for each additional child 15%. Also created was a home mother allowance, which had been advocated by natalist and Catholic women&#x27;s groups since 1929. All mothers who were not professionally employed and whose husbands collected family allowances were eligible for the new benefit. In March 1939, the government added 10% for workers whose wives stayed home to take care of the children. Family allowances were enshrined in the Family Code of July 1939 and, with the exception of the stay-at-home allowance, are still in force. In addition, a decree was issued in May 1938 to allow the establishment of vocational guidance centres. In July 1937, a new law, which was followed by a similar law in May 1946, empowered the Department of Workplace Inspection to order temporary medical interventions.

On 30 November 1938, a major crisis in Franco-Italian relations began with stage-managed &quot;spontaneous&quot; demonstrations in the Italian Chamber of Deputies. On cue, the Italian deputies rose up to shout &quot;Tunis, Corsica, Nice, Savoy!&quot; Mussolini had expected that his &quot;Sudeten methods&quot; would lead to France ceding Tunisia, Corsica, Nice and Savoy to Italy, but Daladier rejected the Italian demands completely. In his annual Christmas radio broadcast to the French people, Daladier gave what the British historian D.C. Watt called &quot;an extremely tough speech&quot; rejecting all of the Italian demands and warned that France would go to war to defend its territory.

The British historian Richard Overy wrote: &quot;The greatest achievement of Daladier in 1939 was to win from the British a firm commitment&quot;, the so-called &quot;continental commitment&quot; that every French leader had sought since 1919. Daladier had a low opinion of Britain and told Bullitt in November 1938 that he &quot;fully expected to be betrayed by the British... he considered Chamberlain a desiccated stick; the King a moron; and the Queen an excessively ambitious woman... he felt that England had become so feeble and senile that the British would give away every possession of their friends rather than stand up to Germany and Italy&quot;. In late 1938 to early 1939, the British embassy was bombarded with rumours from reliable sources within the French government that France would seek an &quot;understanding&quot; with Germany that would resolve all problems in their relations. The fact that French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet was indeed seeking such an understanding lent credence to such rumours.

Daladier let Bonnet pursue his own foreign policy in the hope that it might finally spur the British into making the &quot;continental commitment&quot; since a France aligned with Germany would make the &quot;Reich&quot; Europe&#x27;s strongest power and leave Britain with no ally of comparable strength in Europe. In January 1939, Daladier let the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; manufacture the &quot;Dutch War Scare&quot;. French intelligence fed misinformation to MI6 that Germany was about to invade the Netherlands with the aim of using Dutch air fields to launch a bombing campaign to raze British cities to the ground. As France was the only nation in Western Europe with an army strong enough to save the Netherlands, the &quot;Dutch War Scare&quot; led the British to make anxious inquiries in Paris to ask the French to intervene if the Netherlands were indeed invaded. In response, Daladier stated that if the British wanted the French to do something for their security, it was only fair for the British do something for French security. Daladier gave evasive answers to the British ambassador Sir Eric Phipps that France would do if Germany invaded the Netherlands, and that &quot;French military authorities do not consider France is now in a position to defend herself without the military assistance from the United Kingdom&quot;. On 6 February 1939, Chamberlain, in a speech to the House of Commons, finally made the &quot;continental commitment&quot; as he told the House: &quot;The solidarity that unites France and Britain is such that any threat to the vital interests of France must bring about the co-operation of Great Britain&quot;. On 13 February 1939, staff talks between the British Imperial General Staff and the French General Staff were opened.

Daladier supported Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of creating a &quot;peace front&quot; that was meant to deter Germany from aggression but was unhappy with the British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland, which Chamberlain had announced to the House of Commons on 31 March 1939. France had been allied to Poland since 1921, but Daladier had been bitter by the German-Polish Nonaggression Pact of 1934 and the Polish annexation of part of Czechoslovakia in 1938. Like other French leaders, he regarded the &quot;Sanation&quot; regime ruling Poland as a fickle and unreliable friend of France. The rise in French industrial output and the greater financial stability in 1939 as a result of Reynaud&#x27;s reforms led Daladier to view the possibility of war with the &quot;Reich&quot; more favourably than had been the case in 1938. By September 1939, France&#x27;s aircraft production was equal to Germany&#x27;s, and 170 American planes were arriving per month.

The Neutrality Acts were still in effect, but the supportive stance of US President Franklin Roosevelt led Daladier to assume that the Americans would maintain a pro-French neutrality and that their tremendous industrial resources would aid France if the Danzig Crisis ended in war.

Daladier was far keener than Chamberlain was to bring the Soviet Union into the &quot;peace front&quot; and believed that only an alliance with the Soviets could deter Hitler from invading Eastern Europe. During the Danzig crisis, Daladier was far committed to bringing the Soviet Union into the &quot;peace front&quot; meant to deter Germany from invading Poland than was Chamberlain, and Daladier often expressed with the British &quot;go slow&quot; negotiating tactics with Moscow.

Daladier did not want a war with Germany in 1939 but sought to have such an overwhelming array of forces arranged against Germany that Hitler would be deterred from invading Poland. Daladier believed that Polish Guarantee by Britain would encourage Poland to object to having the Soviet Union join the &quot;peace front&quot;, which indeed proved to be the case. The Poles refused to grant transit rights to the Red Army, which the Soviets made a precondition for their joining the &quot;peace front&quot;. Daladier felt that Chamberlain should not have made guarantee until the Poles had agreed to grant transit rights to the Red Army. He charged that the guarantee made British and French diplomats have more leverage over Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Jozef Beck, who was widely disliked by other diplomats for his stubbornness and haughty manners.

Daladier felt that on economic and military grounds, it was better to have the Soviet Union serve as the &quot;eastern pivot&quot; of the &quot;peace front&quot; than for Poland to do so, as the British preferred. Daladier disliked the Poles and the guarantee but believed in maintaining the alliance with Poland; he believed that France should stand by its commitments.

A public opinion poll in June 1939 showed that 76% of the French believed that France should immediately declare war if Germany tried to seize the Free City of Danzig. For Daladier, the possibility that the Soviet Union might join the &quot;peace front&quot; was a &quot;lifeline&quot; and the best way of stopping another world war. He was deeply frustrated by the Polish refusal to permit transit rights for the Red Army.

On 19 August 1939, Beck, in a telegram to Daladier, stated: &quot;We have not got a military agreement with the USSR. We do not want to have one&quot;.

Though the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August ruined Daladier&#x27;s hopes of an Anglo-Franco-Soviet &quot;peace front&quot;, he still believed that France and Britain could stop Germany together. On 27 August 1939, Daladier told Bullitt, &quot;there was no further question of policy to be settled. His sister had put in two bags all the personal keepsakes and belonging he really cared about, and was prepared to leave for a secure spot at any moment. France intended to stand by the Poles, and if Hitler should refuse to negotiate with the Poles over Danzig, and should make war on Poland, France would fight at once&quot;.

==World War II==

After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed, Daladier responded to the public outcry by outlawing the French Communist Party on the basis that it had refused to condemn Joseph Stalin&#x27;s actions. During the Danzig Crisis, Daladier was greatly influenced by the advice that he received from Robert Coulondre, the French ambassador in Berlin, that Hitler would back down if France made a firm enough stand toward Poland. On 31 August 1939, Daladier read out to the French cabinet a letter he received from Coulondre: &quot;The trial of strength turns to our advantage. It is only necessary to hold, hold, hold!&quot;

After the German invasion of Poland on 1 September, he reluctantly declared war on 3 September and inaugurated the Phoney War. On 6 October, Hitler offered France and Britain a peace proposal. There were more than a few in the French government who were prepared to take Hitler up on his offer, but in a nationwide broadcast the next day, Daladier declared, &quot;We took up arms against aggression. We shall not put them down until we have guarantees for a real peace and security, a security which is not threatened every six months&quot;. On 29 January 1940, in a radio address delivered to the people of France, &quot;&quot;, Daladier explicitly stated his opinion of the Germans: &quot;For us, there is more to do than merely win the war. We shall win it, but we must also win a victory far greater than that of arms. In this world of masters and slaves, which those madmen who rule at Berlin are seeking to forge, we must also save liberty and human dignity&quot;.

In March 1940, Daladier resigned as prime minister because of his failure to aid Finland&#x27;s defence during the Winter War, and he was replaced by Paul Reynaud. Daladier remained defence minister, however, and his antipathy to the new prime minister prevented Reynaud from dismissing Maurice Gamelin as Supreme Commander of the French armed forces. As a result of the massive German breakthrough at Sedan, Daladier swapped ministerial offices with Reynaud and became foreign minister while Reynaud became defence minister. Gamelin was finally replaced by Maxime Weygand on 19 May 1940, nine days after the Germans began the Battle of France.

Under the impression that the French government would continue in North Africa, Daladier fled with other members of the government to French Morocco, but he was arrested and tried for treason by the Vichy government during the Riom Trial.

Daladier was interned in Fort du Portalet, in the Pyrenees. He was kept in prison from 1940 to April 1943, when he was handed over to the Germans and deported to Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. In May 1943, he was transported to the Itter Castle, in North Tyrol, with other French dignitaries, where he remained until the end of the war. He was freed after the Battle for Castle Itter.

==Postwar==
After the war ended, Daladier was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1946 and acted as a patron to the Radical-Socialist Party&#x27;s young reforming leader, Pierre Mendès-France. He also was elected as the Mayor of Avignon in 1953. He opposed the transferral of powers to Charles de Gaulle after the May 1958 crisis but, in the subsequent legislative elections of that year, failed to secure re-election. He withdrew from politics after a career of almost 50 years at the age of 74.

==Death==
Daladier died in Paris on 10 October 1970, at the age of 86. He was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

The Canadian historian Robert Young wrote that Daladier&#x27;s historical reputation has been tainted by his association with appeasement with his image being of a &quot;weary Sancho Panza to Chamberlain&#x27;s Don Quixote&quot;, namely of a weak, cowardly man who signed the Munich Agreement out of personal weakness rather than conviction, which has made his historical reputation even worse than that of Chamberlain. Young further noted that though Daladier was no longer premier in May–June 1940, the popular image of the French defeat of 1940 is that of an effortless German triumph with French hardly fighting at all in defence of their nation, which in turn has been linked to appeasement as the popular image of the appeasers is of cowardly, wimpy men unable to stand to Hitler. Young wrote that in the English-speaking world, a key difference in the historical writing about the origins of the Second World War is that British appeasers such as Chamberlain are seen as individuals with their support for appeasement being explained to their own personalities while the support of French appeasers such as Daladier for appeasement is explained by them being French with the clear implication that cowardice is the principle national characteristic of all French people. Young argued that the popular image in the English-speaking world of the French not fighting at all in defence of France in 1940 is not true as about 120, 000 French servicemen were killed in action between 10 May-21 June 1940. Young has argued that the picture of Daladier as a key figure in a process of inexorable national decline that ended in France&#x27;s defeat in 1940 is too teleological and deterministic and failed to address Daladier&#x27;s efforts at increased rearmament and his attempts to forge an alliance with Great Britain against Germany. Young has further maintained too much of the historical writing on Daladier is more concerned about making sweeping generalisations about the French with the implied message that English-speaking peoples such as the British and the Americans are more courageous and honourable, which he deplored as nationalistic history-writing that prevented the historical understanding of what happened in France and why.

<text>Luxembourg Airport is the main airport in Luxembourg. Previously called Luxembourg Findel Airport () due to its location at Findel, it is Luxembourg&#x27;s only international airport and is the only airport in the country with a paved runway. It is located east of Luxembourg City. In 2024, it handled over 5 million passengers. It is a major cargo airport, ranking as Europe&#x27;s fifth-busiest by cargo tonnage and the world&#x27;s 28th-busiest in 2010. Luxair, Luxembourg&#x27;s flag-carrier, and cargo airline Cargolux have their head offices on the airport property.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
The airport was originally known as &quot;Sandweiler Airport&quot;, and was opened in the 1930s as a small grass airfield with a relatively short, runway.

Neutral Luxembourg was invaded by Germany on 10 May 1940, and on 21 May the Luftwaffe assigned Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53), a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter unit, to the airport. JG 53 was engaged in combat against the French and British Expeditionary Force in France during the Battle of France in May and June. In addition, Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52) operated Bf 109s from Sandweiler during the Blitzkrieg. JG 52 moved into France on 29 May but JG 53 remained in Luxembourg until 18 August when it moved closer to the English Channel to take part in the Battle of Britain.

Sandweiler Airport then remained unused by the Luftwaffe until September 1944, when &quot;Aufklärungsgruppe&quot; 123 (AKG 123), a reconnaissance unit which flew the Henschel Hs 126, a two-seat reconnaissance and observation aircraft, was assigned to the airport. AKG 123 moved east into Germany after only a few days when the United States Army moved through Luxembourg and cleared the country of the occupying German forces.

United States Army combat engineers arrived at Sandweiler in mid September 1944 and performed some minor reconstruction to prepare the airfield for Ninth Air Force combat aircraft. The airfield was designated as Advanced Landing Ground &quot;A-97&quot; Sandweiler and was opened on 18 September 1944. The Ninth Air Force 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Group operated a variety of photo-reconnaissance aircraft until 29 October 1944 when they also moved east into Germany.

Sandweiler Airport was used by the Americans for the rest of the war as a transport supply airfield and also to evacuate combat casualties to the UK. It was returned to Luxembourgish control on 15 August 1945.

===1950-1999===
During the late 1960s and 1970s, Icelandair used Findel Airport as their European hub, connecting cities in North America with Europe at Luxembourg.

In March 1999, Luxair launched direct flights to Newark using a Boeing 767, terminating them after only seven months of operations.

===Development since the 2000s===
In 2002, TAROM routed its flight from Bucharest to New York through Luxembourg in an attempt to increase the number of passengers.

Luxembourg Airport has constructed a high-security zone far away from most airport activities in order to attract the business of transporting valuable goods such as art and jewels. According to Hiscox, there is a &quot;massive demand&quot; for such a hub for precious cargo. Planes taxi away from main airport facilities before loading.

In 2015, the airline with the largest share of the airport&#x27;s total passenger volume was still Luxair with 1.69 million passengers at a 63% share. Luxembourg Airport was closed to all passenger traffic for a week from 23 March to 29 March 2020 as a public health measure during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, it was announced that public announcements in Luxembourgish (and in German as well) at Luxembourg Airport would cease after many decades of use; it would only be using French and English for future public announcements. declared itself to be hugely upset by this new governmental measure, citing that other airports in the world seem to have no problems making public announcements in multiple languages; according to a poll conducted by AL, 92.84% of people in Luxembourg wished to have public announcements to be made in Luxembourgish at Luxembourg Airport. All written signs at Luxembourg Airport are only in French and English. This non-use of Luxembourgish and German (two official languages of Luxembourg) have fueled claims of linguistic discrimination, some pointing out that other airports seem to have no difficulties using up to 4 different languages in written signs.

In December 2023, China Southern Airlines began service to Zhengzhou.

==Terminals==
===Terminal A===
Built in 1975, the building was the only terminal of the airport for 30 years, until terminal B opened in 2004. The terminal was getting overcrowded especially during the summer period, and only contained four shops, a post office and a restaurant. The terminal started to be demolished at the end of 2011 and was complete by March 2012; this was to make way for a footbridge connecting terminal B to the new terminal A. Construction of the new Terminal A started in 2005 and it was inaugurated in May 2008.

===Terminal B===
Terminal B opened in 2004. The building is unique as it only has gates and no check-in counters or arrivals hall. It was built for small planes with a maximum capacity of 50 people. It can handle up to 600,000 passengers a year. The Terminal reopened in the summer of 2017 after some arrangements to handle aircraft with a capacity of up to 110 passengers and a total of 1 million passengers annually.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Ground transportation==
===Road===
The airport can be reached via autoroute A1 (Luxembourg City - Trier) and is also connected with the surrounding areas by public bus transport route 29 and 223, which also reaches Luxembourg railway station, and bus route 6 and 16, as well as by a cross-border coach service to nearby Trier in Germany.

===Rail===
The airport is due to become the northern terminus of Line 1 of the Luxembourg City tramway, with the extension from Luxexpo scheduled to open on 2 March 2025. Trial runs were conducted during December 2024.

In 2003, the Chamber of Deputies approved then-Minister of Transportation Henri Grethen&#x27;s project to link the airport to the central train station via Luxexpo by a mostly underground railway connection. Work began in September 2008, but the project was shelved in 2009 due to budgetary constraints - it was estimated to cost 1.5 billion euros. A tunnel under the airport was nonetheless built, and has stood empty ever since.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 22 December 1969, Vickers Viscount LX-LGC of Luxair was damaged beyond economic repair when it ran off the runway and the nose wheel collapsed.
* On 29 September 1982, Aeroflot Flight 343 ran off the runway on landing.
* On 6 November 2002, Luxair Flight 9642, Fokker 50 (registration LX-LGB) from Berlin, Germany crashed in a field near the village of Niederanven during its final approach. 20 passengers and crew were killed.
* On 21 January 2010, Cargolux Flight 7933, a Boeing 747-4R7F flying from Hong Kong to Luxembourg via Azerbaijan and Spain, collided with a van while attempting to land on runway 24. The aircraft suffered minor damage while the van sustained substantial damage with the driver only sustaining minor injuries. A subsequent investigation determined that errors from air traffic control caused both vehicles to be on a collision course.
*On April 15, 2023, Cargolux Flight 7545, a Boeing 747-4HQFER registered as LX-ECV, suffered damage after a hard landing during a flight from Dubai&#x27;s Al Maktoum International Airport. The airplane landed hard on its left wing, then did a go-around before landing, with damage to their number 2, or left wing&#x27;s inner, engine. No one was injured in the incident.
*In May 2023, Cargolux Flight 6857, a Boeing 747-4R7F registered as LX-OCV, crash landed at the airport a short while after taking off; the landing gear would not retract after take off and the decision was made to land the aircraft. The main landing gear separated from the aircraft during landing.

<doc id="400255" wikidata="Q1426203" url="?curid=400255" title="Mississippi Delta">
<text>The Mississippi Delta, also known as the Yazoo–Mississippi Delta, or simply the Delta, is the distinctive northwest section of the U.S. state of Mississippi (and portions of Arkansas and Louisiana) that lies between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers. The region has been called &quot;The Most Southern Place on Earth&quot; (&quot;Southern&quot; in the sense of &quot;characteristic of its region, the American South&quot;), because of its unique racial, cultural, and economic history.

The Delta is long and across at its widest point, encompassing about , or, almost 7,000 square miles of alluvial floodplain. Originally covered in hardwood forest across the bottomlands, it was developed as one of the richest cotton-growing areas in the nation before the American Civil War (1861–1865). The region attracted many speculators who developed land along the riverfronts for cotton plantations; they became wealthy planters dependent on the labor of people they enslaved, who composed the vast majority of the population in these counties well before the Civil War, often twice the number of whites.

As the riverfront areas were developed first and railroads were slowly constructed, most of the delta&#x27;s bottomlands remained undeveloped, even after the Civil War. Both Black and White migrants flowed into Mississippi, using their labor to clear land and sell timber in order to buy land. By the end of the 19th century, Black farmers made up two-thirds of the independent farmers in the Mississippi Delta.

In 1890, the white-dominated state legislature passed a new state constitution effectively disenfranchising most blacks in the state. In the next three decades, most blacks lost their lands due to tight credit and political oppression. African Americans had to resort to sharecropping and tenant farming to survive. Their political exclusion was maintained by the whites until after the gains of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.

The majority of residents in several counties in the region are still Black, although more than 400,000 African Americans left the state during the Great Migration in the first half of the 20th century, moving to Northeastern, Midwestern, and Western industrial cities. As the agricultural economy does not support many jobs or businesses, the region has attempted to diversify. Lumbering is important and new crops such as soybeans have been cultivated in the area by the largest industrial farmers. At times, the region has suffered heavy flooding from the Mississippi River, notably in 1927 and 2011.

==Geography==

Despite the name, this region is not the delta of the Mississippi River. The shifting river delta at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf Coast lies some 300 miles south of this area in Louisiana, and is referred to as the Mississippi &quot;River&quot; Delta. Rather, the Mississippi Delta is part of an alluvial plain, created by regular flooding of the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers over thousands of years. The climate is humid subtropical, with short mild winters, and long, hot and wet summers.

The land is flat and contains some of the most fertile soil in the world as part of the Mississippi embayment. It is two hundred miles long and seventy miles across at its widest point, encompassing approximately 4,415,000 acres, or, some 7,000 square miles of alluvial floodplain. On the east, it is bounded by bluffs extending beyond the Yazoo River.

The Delta includes all or part of the following counties: Washington, Western DeSoto, Humphreys, Carroll, Issaquena, Western Panola, Quitman, Bolivar, Coahoma, Leflore, Sunflower, Sharkey, Tate, Tunica, Tallahatchie, Western Holmes, Western Yazoo, Western Grenada, and Warren.

==Demographics==

In the 21st century, about one-third of Mississippi&#x27;s African American population resides in the Delta, which has many black-majority state legislative districts. Much of the Delta is included in Mississippi&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, represented by Democrat Bennie Thompson.

Chinese immigrants began settling in Bolivar County and other Delta counties as plantation workers in the 1870s, though most Delta Chinese families migrated to the state between the 1900s and 1930s. Most of these immigrants worked to leave the fields, becoming merchants in the small rural towns. As these have declined, along with other Delta residents ethnic Chinese have moved to cities or other states. Their descendants represent most of the ethnic Asian residents of the Delta recorded in censuses. While many descendants of the Delta Chinese have left the Delta, their population has increased in the state.

The Mississippi Delta received waves of immigration from three areas which have provided many of America&#x27;s immigrants: China, Mexico, and Italy. The Italians of the Mississippi Delta brought with them elements of Italian cuisine to the region, and possibly most importantly, elements of Southern Italian music such as the mandolin, which became a part of the music of the Mississippi Delta Blues. Mexican immigrants to the Mississippi Delta greatly influenced the cuisine of the Mississippi Delta, leading to the development of one of the Deltas most famous culinary inventions, the Delta-style tamale, also known as the hot tamale.

==Agriculture and the Delta economy==
===Plantations===
For more than two centuries, agriculture has been the mainstay of the Delta economy. Sugar cane and rice were introduced to the region by European settlers from the Caribbean in the 18th century. Sugar and rice production were centered in southern Louisiana, and later in the Arkansas Delta.

Early agriculture also included limited tobacco production in the Natchez area and indigo in the lower Mississippi. French yeomen settlers, supported by extensive families, had begun the back-breaking process of clearing the land to establish farms. European settlers in the region attempted to enslave local Native Americans for labor, though this proved unsuccessful as they frequently escaped. By the 18th century, the settlers had switched to importing enslaved Africans instead as a source of labor. In the early years of European colonization, enslaved African laborers brought critical knowledge and techniques for the cultivation and processing of both rice and indigo. Hundreds of thousands of Africans were captured, sold and transported as slaves from West Africa to North America.

The invention of the cotton gin in the late 18th century made profitable the cultivation of short-staple cotton. This type could not be grown in the upland areas of the South, leading to the rapid development of King Cotton throughout what became known as the Deep South. The demand for labor drove the domestic slave trade, and more than one million African American slaves were forced by sales into the South, taken in a forced migration from families in the Upper South. After continued European-American settlement in the area, congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 extinguished Native American claims to these lands.

The Five Civilized Tribes and others were mostly removed west of the Mississippi River, and European-American settlement expanded at a rapid rate in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. In the areas of greatest cotton cultivation, whites were far outnumbered by their slaves.

Many slaves were transported to Delta towns by riverboat from slave markets in New Orleans, which became the fourth largest city in the country by 1840. Other slaves were transported downriver from slave markets at Memphis and Louisville. Still others were transported by sea in the coastwise slave trade. By this time, slavery had long been established as a racial caste. African Americans for generations worked the commodity plantations, which they made extremely profitable. In the opinion of Jefferson Davis, typical of that of Mississippian whites of his day, Africans being held in slavery reflected the will of Providence, as it led to their Christianizing and to the improvement of their condition, compared to what it would have been had they remained in Africa. According to Davis, the Africans &quot;increased from a few unprofitable savages to millions of efficient Christian laborers.&quot;

By the early 19th century, cotton had become the Delta&#x27;s premier crop, for which there was high international demand. Mills in New England and New York also demanded cotton for their industry, and New York City was closely tied to the cotton trade. Many southern planters traveled so frequently there for business that they had favorite hotels. From 1822 cotton-related exports comprised half of all exports from the port of New York City. In 1861 Democratic mayor Fernando Wood called for secession of New York City because of its close business ties to the South. Eventually the city joined the state in supporting the war, but immigrants resented having to fight when the wealthy could buy their way out of military service.

Comparing cotton&#x27;s preeminence then to that of oil today, Historian Sven Beckert called the Delta &quot;a kind of Saudi Arabia of the early nineteenth century.&quot;

Demand for cotton remained high until well after the American Civil War, even in an era of falling cotton prices. Though cotton planters believed that the alluvial soils of the region would always renew, the agricultural boom from the 1830s to the late 1850s caused extensive soil exhaustion and erosion. Lacking agricultural knowledge, planters continued to raise cotton the same way after the Civil War.

Plantations before the war were generally developed on ridges near the rivers, which were used for transportation of products to market. Most of the territory of Mississippi was still considered wilderness, needing substantial new population. These areas were covered in a heavy dense growth of trees, bushes and vines.

Following the Civil War, 90 percent of the bottomlands in Mississippi were still undeveloped. The state attracted thousands of migrants to its frontier. They could trade their labor in clearing the land to eventually purchase it from their sale of lumber. Tens of thousands of new settlers, both Black and White, were drawn to the area. By the end of the century, two-thirds of the independent farmers in the Mississippi Delta were Black. But, the extended low price of cotton had caused many to go deeply into debt, and gradually they had to sell off their lands, as they had a harder time getting credit than did White farmers. From 1910 to 1920, the first and second generations of African Americans after slavery lost their stake in the land. They had to resort to sharecropping and tenant farming to survive.

Sharecropping and tenant farming replaced the slave-dependent plantation system. African American families retained some autonomy, rather than working on gangs of laborers. As many were illiterate, they were often taken advantage of by the planters&#x27; accounting. The number of lynchings of Black men rose in the region at the time of settling accounts, and researchers have also found a correlation of lynchings to years that were poor economically for the region.

The sharecropping and tenant system, with each family making its own decisions, inhibited the use of progressive agricultural techniques in the region. In the late 19th century, the clearing and drainage of wetlands, especially in Arkansas and the Missouri Bootheel, increased lands available for tenant farming and sharecropping.

Planters needed workers and recruited Italians and Chinese workers in the 19th century to satisfy demand. They quickly moved out of field labor, saving money as communities in order to establish themselves as merchants, often in the small rural towns.

===Mechanization and migration===
During the 1920s and 1930s, in the aftermath of the increasing mechanization of Delta farms that reduced the need for labor, displaced whites and African Americans began to leave the land and move to towns and cities. Tens of thousands of Black laborers left the Jim Crow south for better opportunities in the Northeast and Midwest in the Great Migration, settling in cities such as St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York City. It was not until the Great Depression years of the 1930s and later that large-scale farm mechanization came to the region. The mechanization of agriculture and the availability of domestic work outside the Delta spurred the migration of Delta residents from the region. Farming was unable to absorb the available labor force, and entire families moved together, many going north on the railroad to Chicago. People from the same towns often settled near each other.

The view that mechanization sparked the Great Migration—both Black and White—has been challenged by two of the most prominent recent chroniclers of the event. Isabel Wilkerson characterizes the migration as a flight for freedom from the political terror of lynchings and the hardening of Jim Crow restrictions on Black freedom: &quot;They did what human beings looking for freedom, throughout history, have often done. They left.&quot;

Nicholas Lemann notes the onset of the Great Migration coincided with the passage of immigration restrictions that throttled the supply of immigrants who had been willing to take the worst of the jobs of the industrial North, which was relatively free of the suffocating breadth of Jim Crow. Further, Lemann wrote, &quot;it was undeniable that the economic opportunity [in the North] was vastly greater; that moment in the Black rural South was one of the few in American history when virtually every member of a large class of people was guaranteed an immediate quadrupling of income, at least, by simply relocating to a place that was only a long day’s journey away.&quot;

In this view, Southern Blacks were the agents of the Great Migration and not passive objects. Instead, they actively fled oppression and sought freedom, especially in the years between World War I and World War II. A slow mechanization of Delta agriculture during the first phase of the Great Migration was the effect of the migration of a workforce, not its cause. It was not until the mid-1940s that the doctrine of White supremacy demanded that Blacks be displaced. By that time, Lemann writes, Delta Whites feared socio-political changes that might be forced on the Delta by the Roosevelt Democratic coalition and the pressure of returning WWII veterans; the Delta was three-quarters Black, so their voting potential was huge. As Delta native Aaron Henry, who was born in 1922, put it, &quot;They wished we’d go back to Africa, but Chicago was close enough.&quot;

From the late 1930s through the 1950s, the Delta enjoyed an agriculture boom, as wartime needs followed by reconstruction in Europe and Japan expanded the demand for the Delta region&#x27;s farm products. As the mechanization of agriculture continued, women left fieldwork and went into service work, while the men drove tractors and worked on the farms. From the 1960s through the 1990s, thousands of small farms and dwellings in the Delta region were absorbed by large corporate-owned agribusinesses, and the smallest Delta communities have stagnated.
One company that served the agricultural industry in the region was an aerial crop dusting service that eventually became Delta Air Lines, which is currently a major U.S. based passenger air carrier.

Since the late 20th century, lower Delta agriculture has increasingly been dominated by families and nonresident corporate entities that hold large landholdings. Their operations are heavily mechanized with low labor costs. Such farm entities are capital-intensive, where hundreds and thousands of acres are used to produce market-driven crops such as cotton, sugar, rice, and soybeans.

===Diversification===
Remnants of the region&#x27;s agrarian heritage are scattered along the highways and byways of the lower Delta. Larger communities have survived by fostering economic development in education, government, and medicine. Other endeavors such as catfish, poultry, rice, corn, and soybean farming have assumed greater importance. Today, the monetary value of these crops rivals that of cotton production in the lower Delta. Shifts away from the river as a main transportation and trading route to railroads and, more significantly, highways, have left the river cities struggling for new roles and businesses.

Due to the growth of the automobile industry in the South, many parts suppliers have opened facilities in the Delta (as well as on the Arkansas Delta side of the Mississippi River, another area of high poverty). The 1990s state legalization of casino gambling in Mississippi has boosted the Delta&#x27;s economy, particularly in the areas of Tunica and Vicksburg.

A large cultural influence in the region is its history of hunting and fishing. Hunting in the Delta is primarily for game such as whitetail deer, wild turkey, and waterfowl, along with many small game species (squirrel, rabbit, dove, quail, raccoon, etc.) For many years, the hunting and fishing have also attracted visitors in the regional tourism economy. The Delta is one of the top waterfowl destinations in the world because it is in the middle of the Mississippi Flyway (the largest of all the migratory bird routes in America).

==Political environment==
Delta politics was dominated by Democrats during the post-Civil War era, though areas of resistance from blacks and whites remained throughout the era. Some of these Southern Democrats resorted to using fraud, violence, and intimidation to regain control of the state legislature in the late 19th century. Civic groups such as the Red Shirts in Mississippi were active against Republicans and blacks, sometimes using violence to suppress their voting for state candidates. But many blacks continued to be elected to local offices, and there was a biracial coalition between Republicans and Populists that briefly gained state power in the late 1880s.

To prevent this from happening again, in 1890 the Mississippi state legislature passed a new constitution which effectively disenfranchised most blacks by use of such devices as poll taxes, literacy tests and grandfather clauses, which withstood court challenges. If one method was overturned by the courts, the state would come up with another to continue exclusion of blacks from the political system. Unable to vote, they could not participate on juries. The state passed legislation to impose racial segregation and other aspects of Jim Crow.

This system of oppression was maintained with violence and economic boycotts into the years of increasing activism for civil rights, as blacks worked to regain their constitutional rights as citizens. The Delta counties were sites of fierce and violent resistance to change, with blacks murdered for trying to register to vote or to use public facilities. African Americans were not able to exercise their constitutional rights again until well after their successes in the Civil Rights Movement and gaining passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

==Culture==
===Music===

The Delta is strongly associated as the place where several genres of popular music originated, including Delta blues and rock and roll. The mostly Black sharecroppers and tenant farmers had lives marked by poverty and hardship but they expressed their struggles in music that became the beat, rhythm and songs of cities and a nation.

Gussow (2010) examines the conflict between blues musicians and Black ministers in the region between 1920 and 1942. The ministers condemned blues music as &quot;devil&#x27;s music&quot;. In response, some blues musicians satirized preachers in their music, as for example in the song, &quot;He Calls That Religion&quot;, by the blues group Mississippi Sheiks. The lyrics accused Black ministers of engaging in and fomenting sinful behavior. The Black residents were poor, and the musicians and ministers competed for their money. The Great Migration to northern cities, beginning before World War I, seriously depleted Black communities and churches, but the musicians sparked off each other in the industrial cities, with blues in Chicago and St. Louis.

=== Food ===

Hot tamales are a Delta-endemic derivation of the tamale. It is up for debate as to their origins, but it is strongly suggested they arrived in the Delta with migrant Mexican laborers in the early twentieth century and are attested to around that time period in blues music centering around the dish. While their most common filling is pork they differ from the traditional tamale in that they are made from corn meal rather than masa and boiled rather than steamed. Today the dish is associated mainly with African American chefs despite originating from different cultural foodways.

Fried Catfish is a staple of the Mississippi Delta. There exist a number of catfish farms throughout the region which supply fresh and local fish to kitchens across the Delta. The meal consists of catfish filets which are breaded and fried. Many sides exist for the dish and are nonessential. One such side, hushpuppies, is common to fried catfish plates in the Delta.

Chow Mein arrived to the Delta as it did in many different parts of the United States, with Chinese immigrants arriving around the turn of the century.

Hoover Sauce is a twist on traditional Cantonese duck sauce introduced by the Hoover family in the mid-20th century. The sauce is usually served with meat such as locally hunted duck or steak. It is unique to the Delta.

Soul Food broadly is found sold and cooked throughout the Delta. The region&#x27;s large African American population and historical roots make this cuisine of the Delta&#x27;s truly endemic food traditions. Many dishes such as fried okra, mashed potatoes, black-eyed peas, fried chicken, cornbread, and others are associated with soul food in the Delta.

===Primary and secondary schools===
As of 2005, the majority of students in public schools in the Mississippi Delta are Black, and the majority of private school students are White. This &quot;de facto&quot; racial segregation is related in part to economics, as few African American parents in the poor region can pay to send their children to private schools. Suzanne Eckes of &quot;The Journal of Negro Education&quot; wrote, &quot;Although &quot;de facto&quot; segregation in schools exists throughout the country, the &quot;de facto&quot; segregation that exists in the Mississippi Delta region is somewhat unique.&quot;

During the years of segregation, public school systems did not know how to classify the minority Chinese students, initially requiring them to attend schools with blacks. Their socioeconomic status affected their classification and, as their parents became merchants and filed legal suits, in some areas they gained entrance for their children to White schools, before the schools were integrated beginning in the late 1960s.

<doc id="400258" wikidata="Q5269618" url="?curid=400258" title="Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology">
<text>Dhirubhai Ambani University (DAU), formerly and widely known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), is a private self-financed university located in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. It is named after Reliance Group founder Dhirubhai Ambani. It is run by the Dhirubhai Ambani Foundation and is promoted by the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group.

== History ==
DA-IICT began admitting students in August 2001, with an intake of 240 undergraduate students for its Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) program in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Over the years, it expanded to include postgraduate courses such as Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in ICT, Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Data Science, Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Information Technology, Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Agriculture and Rural Development, Master in Design (M.Des.), and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program. The duration of the bachelor&#x27;s program was four years. The first batch of DA-IICT postgraduates graduated in 2004, and the first batch of undergraduates graduated in 2005.

In 2004, three M.Sc. (IT) students from DA-IICT challenged IIM Ahmedabad&#x27;s decision to deny them admission interviews, citing the institute&#x27;s eligibility criteria based on AIU and AICTE affiliation. The case was brought in the Gujarat High Court, which ruled in favor of the students. Following the judgment, the CAT eligibility criteria were subsequently modified.

In 2023, the institute ranked first in the IIRF Ranking 2023 for private universities.

=== Renaming and Expansion ===
In March 2024, the Gujarat Legislative Assembly passed a bill to rename the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT) to Dhirubhai Ambani University (DAU). This change was part of a broader effort to align the institution with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasizes multidisciplinary education and research. The renaming reflects the university&#x27;s expanded scope, moving beyond its original focus on information and communication technology (ICT) to include a wide range of disciplines.

<doc id="400260" wikidata="Q1068307" url="?curid=400260" title="Pocky">
<text>is a Japanese sweet snack food produced by the Ezaki Glico food company. Pocky was first sold in 1966, and was invented by Yoshiaki Koma. It consists of coated biscuit sticks. It was named after the Japanese onomatopoeic word , which is supposed to resemble the sound of the snack being cracked.
The original chocolate-coated Pocky was followed by an almond-coated variant in 1971, and a strawberry coating in 1977. Today, the product line includes variations in the flavored coatings, such as milk, mousse, matcha (green tea), honey, banana, cookies and cream, strawberry and coconut, and themed products such as &quot;Decorer Pocky&quot;, with colorful decorative stripes in the coating, and &quot;Men&#x27;s Pocky&quot;, a &quot;mature&quot; dark (bittersweet) chocolate version.

==World distribution==
Pocky is a very popular treat in Japan, especially among teenagers. In bars, it is sometimes served with a glass of ice water or milk.
 It also has a significant presence in other Asian countries, such as China, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Burma, Brunei and Vietnam. In Malaysia, Pocky was sold under the name &quot;Rocky&quot; for five decades. It was rebranded under the name &quot;Pocky&quot; in 2014, along with a new package design and slogan. Commercials featuring Malaysian singer Yuna, also began to air in 2015 in order to give brand recognition and a sales boost.

In Europe, Pocky is produced under license by Mondelēz International and sold under the name &quot;Mikado&quot; in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. &quot;Mikado&quot; can be found at most supermarkets and many international food stores.

In the United States and Canada, Pocky can be found in Asian supermarkets and the international section of most large supermarkets; such retailers include World Market, H-E-B, Wegmans, Kroger, Jungle Jim&#x27;s International Market, Costco, Walmart (in the Asian foods aisle), some Target stores, some Walgreens, Meijer, Fiesta, Barnes &amp; Noble, and anime convention dealers&#x27; rooms. In the United States, Pocky is marketed both by LU (in chocolate and peanut butter flavors), and by Ezaki Glico&#x27;s American division, Ezaki Glico USA Corporation (in chocolate and strawberry flavors).

In Australia and New Zealand, it is usually sold in Asian convenience markets, along with other Asian foods and products. Like the United States and Canada these are also widely available in the international sections on the Asian food aisles of most supermarket chains. Specialty importers also exist in Australia and New Zealand.

In Turkey, Pocky is produced by Ülker and Şölen, under Biskrem Bi&#x27;stik and Biscolata Stix name.

In 2020, Pocky was certified by Guinness World Records as the &quot;largest chocolate-coated biscuit brand&quot; after hitting over 500 million dollars in sales in the past year. 

==Flavors and variations==

Pocky can be found in dozens of varieties such as chocolate, strawberry, and almond. Some of the more unusual flavors include the seasonal flavors of honey (spring) and kiwifruit mango (summer). The bittersweet version of chocolate Pocky is known as Men&#x27;s Pocky. Regional flavors of Pocky include grape (Nagano), &quot;yūbari&quot; melon (Hokkaidō), giant &quot;mikan&quot; (tangerine, sold in the Kyūshū region), powdered tea azuki bean (Kyoto), Kobe wine (Kobe), and five-fusion berry (Goka). Also, flavors such as banana, lychee, coffee, caramel, marble royal milk tea, melon, Daim bar (sold in the UK), milk, honey and milk, cream cheese, berry, sweet potato, coconut, crush (crunchy cracker pieces in chocolate), corn on the cob, pineapple, pumpkin, kurogoma (black sesame), kinako (soybean flour), Brazilian pudding, cherry, tomato, orange, mikan, blueberry, apple yogurt, hazelnut, mixed berry and green tea are available.

The latest flavors are special editions, 2 two-tone flavors in a larger box than chocolate or strawberry Pocky provides ( Special Editions: 2.47 oz. [70 g], Normal Pocky: 1.41 oz. [40 g]). The 2 newest flavors are cookies and cream and banana chocolate. Both have brown biscuit sticks (in the chocolate banana Pocky case, the biscuit is the chocolate and banana cream.) The cookies and cream consists of blended chocolate biscuit cookies with a slight chocolaty flavor of the biscuit.

Special variations of Pocky include Decorer Pocky (which features extra decorative icing) and Mousse Pocky (which features extra-thick, &quot;creamy&quot; mousse-like icing and is more exclusive). Unlike other Pocky variations, Mousse Pocky packages contain only nine per pack, fewer pieces than regular Pocky.

Dessert Pocky features Pocky sticks covered in a generous helping of cream. These flavors include Double Chocolate, Tiramisu, Chocolate Banana, Marron White, Chestnut, Strawberry Shortcake, and Orange. Dessert Pocky usually comes with five packets in a box with three in each sleeve.

Another variation of Pocky is the , which has one-fourth the calories of regular chocolate Pocky.

Other variations include Pocky G (marketed as being &quot;hard and rich&quot;), Giant Pocky (strawberry- and chocolate-flavored; each box contains 20 individually wrapped sticks with real dried strawberry; each stick is about 10&quot; long, and about three times the diameter of a normal Pocky stick), Giant Dream Pocky (box of 20 individually wrapped 10&quot; sticks; each stick is in one of the five featured flavors of melon, grape, green tea, strawberry or standard chocolate), Sakura Pocky (limited edition that is part of the Luxury Chocolatier sub-group; each stick is coated with pink cherry blossom essenced chocolate sprinkled with a bit of salt), Reverse Pocky (cracker on the outside with the filling in the middle), Fortune-Telling Pocky (each stick contains a &quot;fortune&quot;), and Pocky Cake (a literal cake shaped to look like a Pocky stick. Each cake contains, according to its packaging, raisins, chocolate cream, orange peel, and an Italian cake batter).

A recent Limited Edition Pocky is called Otona no Kohaku or &quot;Adult Amber&quot; Pocky, which is bitter chocolate slightly salted, and meant to be used as an aperitif paired with whiskey. These are sold in a cylindrical canister containing six packages.
A product related to Pocky is Pretz, which is an unglazed version of Pocky, featuring flavors like tomato, pizza, and salad, as well as sweet flavors such as cocoa and French toast.

==Glico Morinaga case==

In 1984, following threats by the Monster with 21 Faces to poison Glico confections and the resulting mass withdrawal of Glico products from shelves, a man wearing a Yomiuri Giants baseball cap was caught placing Glico chocolate on a store shelf by a security camera. This man was believed to be the mastermind behind the Monster with 21 Faces. The security camera photo was made public after this incident.

==Melamine contamination==

On September 30, 2008, Hong Kong authorities announced that melamine had been detected in Pocky Men&#x27;s coffee cream-coated biscuit sticks made in China. Ezaki Glico had no immediate comment on the reported contamination. The melamine contamination level was found to be 43 ppm (the legal limit is 2.5 ppm). On October 17, 2008, Pocky Men&#x27;s coffee cream-coated biscuit sticks were banned in Sri Lanka by the country&#x27;s health ministry alongside 59 other products containing melamine.
==The name==
The name of the European version “Mikado” comes from the game of the same name. It is played with thin &amp; long sticks, hence the name.

<doc id="400265" wikidata="Q1788795" url="?curid=400265" title="Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton">
<text>Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton (21 December 1505 – 30 July 1550), was an English peer, secretary of state, Lord Chancellor and Lord High Admiral. A naturally skilled but unscrupulous and devious politician who changed with the times, Wriothesley served as a loyal instrument of King Henry VIII in the latter&#x27;s break with the Catholic Church. Richly rewarded with royal gains from the Dissolution of the Monasteries, he nevertheless prosecuted Calvinists and other Protestants when political winds changed.

== Early life ==
Thomas Wriothesley (pronounced &#x27;Reeseley&#x27;), born in London 21 December 1505, was the son of York Herald William Wriothesley, whose ancestors had spelled the family surname &quot;Wryth&quot;, and Agnes Drayton, daughter and heiress of James Drayton of London. Thomas had two sisters, Elizabeth, born in 1507, and Anne, born in 1508, and a brother, Edward, born in 1509. Thomas&#x27;s father and uncle were the first members of his family to use the &quot;Wriothesley&quot; spelling of the family surname.

Wriothesley received his early education at St. Paul&#x27;s School, London. In 1522 he was admitted to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was taught law by Stephen Gardiner. Although Wriothesley did not take a degree, he and Gardiner remained lifelong friends. In 1524, at the age of nineteen, he entered a career at court and came to the attention of Thomas Cromwell. Before 4 May 1530 he was appointed joint Clerk of the Signet under Gardiner, by then secretary to King Henry VIII, a post Wriothesley held for a decade while continuing in Cromwell&#x27;s service. One historian has described the young lawyer as &quot;able, enterprising, tenacious and ruthless, yet insufferably overconfident and egotistic.&quot;

== A useful courtier ==
A member of the royal secretariat, Wriothesley and William Brereton were charged with helping secure an annulment for the King against Katherine of Aragon from Pope Clement VII to allow Anne Boleyn to assume her royal position; they were sent out to get members of the nobility to sign written statements indicating assent to the annulment. 

Wriothesley was at Windsor with the Court when the series of protests known as the Pilgrimage of Grace broke out in reaction to the religious changes brought in by the crown and its advisors. The Clerk of the Signet admired the King but probably learnt lessons of cruelty from the treatment of Robert Aske in 1536. &quot;It was upon such men that the King relied at times of crisis&quot;. Wriothesley&#x27;s services were richly rewarded at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. He was granted extensive lands between Southampton and Winchester, once belonging to the abbeys of Beaulieu and Titchfield. Even with the retrospection of later life he was able to &#x27;forget&#x27; the excesses of the 1530s, Wriothesley was still able to exaggerate his fidelity to his &quot;benign and pleasant&#x27; King, whom he knew only in the febrile atmosphere of the Court.

Until May 1539, he was Henry VIII&#x27;s ambassador in Brussels. In late 1539, Anne of Cleves was due to come from the German duchy to England, and Wriothesley was to lead the naval escort. On 27 December the Princess arrived at Deal in Kent, from whence she was shown to Dover Castle. On New Years Day the party reached Rochester Castle. Wriothesley continued to support Norfolk&#x27;s Catholic party, but only when it suited him at court, as parties emerged between the reformists and conservatives. In the absence of a predominant figure the Council became more conciliar towards the end of the reign. Having been sent on diplomatic errands abroad, in 1540 Sir Thomas Wriothesley was made one of the King&#x27;s principal secretaries (a position he held jointly with Sir Ralph Sadler), acting as Secretary to the Privy Council. Dividing the duties, Sadler&#x27;s responsibility was as personal secretary to the King, whereas Wriothesley&#x27;s were purely political. Wriothesley was rewarded with the dissolved abbey of Titchfield for good service to the King. He rapidly converted it into a country house, which became the family&#x27;s ancestral seat. Wriothesley&#x27;s noble parentage and strong personality enabled him to dominate the commoner Sadler. Knighted in 1540, Wriothesley made friends with Sir Anthony Browne of the refounded Gentleman Pensioners, who acted as an armed bodyguard of the King pursuant to the Greenwich Ordinances. 

The expansion of the Pensioners from 50 to 350 members signalled the resurgence of the conservative noble faction at court during the 1540s. Wriothesley, having earned his place at court as a faithful attendant to Thomas Cromwell, betrayed Cromwell in 1540, telling the King that Cromwell was indiscreet about Henry&#x27;s inability to consummate his marriage to Anne of Cleves. This news, coupled with the Cleves alliance threatening war with Emperor Charles V, proved Cromwell&#x27;s undoing. Wriothesley happily lied to the Council and betrayed his master, in order to take his place beside the King.

Queen Katherine Howard&#x27;s conviction and execution for adultery signalled that the political pendulum was swinging away from Norfolk once more. On 13 November 1541, Secretary Wriothesley was sent to announce the bad news to members of the Queen&#x27;s Household at Hampton Court; all her chamber were dismissed and sent home. In 1542 it was said that Wriothesley governed almost everything in England. He sought to bring about an alliance between England and Spain in 1543. Wriothesley was one of the Council led by Catholic Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who ordered the imprisonment of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey for being drunk and disorderly. He supported Gardiner&#x27;s crackdown against Lutheran opinions, threatening the lives of reformers Miles Coverdale and Hugh Latimer, presaging the reign of &#x27;Bloody&#x27; Mary. All Protestants were rooted out of the royal household, with those of the new extreme Puritan sect Calvinism being treated with especial prejudice. The Council even intimidated Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, who was protected by the King himself. Sir Ralph Sadler was ousted as the principal secretary to the King, to be replaced by the more judicious and discreet William Paget. But the rise of the conservatives meant Wriothesley had eventually to go, in January 1544, in favour of the openly Catholic Sir William Petre. Fortunately for Cranmer and others, the King was not prepared to turn the clock back to the 1530s, and Katherine Parr, with her experience in two previous marriages, impressed Wriothesley by offering Henry stability in his old age. Furthermore, as Governess to Princess Elizabeth, bringing the children to court at Christmas 1543, Parr showed off what Wriothesley had accurately predicted to be Elizabeth&#x27;s promise as a future leader.

=== A confident counsellor ===
Wriothesley disliked the arrogant, swaggering Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford; they had long been enemies. Wriothesley and Secretary Paget tried to effect a necessary reconciliation, which prompted the former to step down. Hertford was sent north to fight the Scots when on 22 April 1544, Lord Audley died, leaving Wriothesley to be appointed Lord Chancellor the next month, at a time when Gardiner&#x27;s power was waning. Ever the unscrupulous schemer, Wriothesley was purposely chosen to keep both papists and reformists at bay. The King relied heavily on his aristocratic friends Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk and Wriothesley to secure a balance of power in the Privy Chamber. So the King prepared an invasion of France, much to the nobility&#x27;s approval. Wriothesley was created Baron Wriothesley of Titchfield in 1544. But as Lord Chancellor he became notorious for torturing Anne Askew, a self-confessed Protestant, personally operating the wheel on the rack. The Catholic faction was determined to root out heresy, suspecting Queen Katherine&#x27;s influence over the royal children. When Gardiner tried to arrest Surrey&#x27;s friends with Wriothesley&#x27;s support, the Earl was severely reprimanded by the King. On 6 July 1546 the King moved to Greenwich Palace; with the conservatives holding the Secretaryship, Chancellor, and with leading privy councillors, they tried to make further arrests. Wriothesley secured the royal warrant for Katherine&#x27;s arrest but when he went to present it to the King, he was despatched by the King as &quot;Arrant knave! Beast! Fool!&quot;, a humiliation especially damaging given that his faction was already in decline. By September 1546 they were outnumbered by the reformists; his hatred for Hertford had deepened. Privy Council meetings broke out into fisticuffs. The Lord Chancellor conducted French Lord Admiral Claude d&#x27;Annebaut to Hampton Court for a royal audience. He accompanied the royal progress and joined the hunting at Windsor, but Wriothesley had lost control of the Privy Chamber. Speechless and overcome with grief, Lord Chancellor Wriothesley could do nothing to prevent Hertford from taking control in defiance of the late King&#x27;s will.

==Under Edward VI==

He was one of the executors of Henry&#x27;s will, and in accordance with the dead King&#x27;s wishes he was created Earl of Southampton on 16 February 1547 and was a member of the Regency Council that would rule collectively during King Edward VI&#x27;s minority. He was one of the few members of the council to oppose the rise of the King&#x27;s maternal uncle, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, to the position of Lord Protector. Wriothesley objected to Somerset&#x27;s assumption of monarchical power over the Council. In March 1547, he then found himself abruptly dismissed from the chancellorship on charges of selling off some of his offices to delegates. Also he lost his seat on the Privy Council.

Later he was readmitted to the Council, and he took a leading part in bringing about the fall of the Duke of Somerset, but he had not regained his former position when he died on 30 July 1550. His successor in the earldom was his son, Henry.

==Marriage and issue==
Southampton married Jane Cheney (d. 15 September 1574) in 1533, the daughter and heiress of William Cheney of Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, by Emma Walwyn, daughter of Thomas Walwyn, by whom he had three sons and five daughters:
*William Wriothesley (died young).

*Katherine Wriothesley, born c.1539, who was contracted to marry Sir Matthew Arundell, but instead married Thomas Cornwallis, Groom Porter to Queen Elizabeth.
*Anne Wriothesley, born c. 1541, who was contracted to marry Sir Henry Wallop, but who died before the marriage could take place
*Mabel Wriothesley, born c.1543, who married Sir Walter Sandys.

<doc id="400270" wikidata="Q2624401" url="?curid=400270" title="Tsesarevich">
<text>Tsesarevich (, ) was the title of the heir apparent or presumptive in the Russian Empire. It either preceded or replaced the given name and patronymic.

==Usage==
It is often confused with the much more general term tsarevich, the title for any son of any tsar, including non-Russian rulers such as those of Crimea, Siberia, and Georgia. 

Normally, there was only one &quot;tsesarevich&quot; at a time (an exception was Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich, who was accorded the title until death, even though law gave it to his nephew), and the title was used exclusively in Russia.

The title came to be used invariably in tandem with the formal style &quot;Successor&quot; (), as in &quot;His Imperial Highness the Successor Tsesarevich and Grand Prince&quot;. The wife of the &quot;Tsesarevich&quot; was the tsesarevna ().

==History==
In 1721 Peter the Great discontinued use of &quot;tsar&quot; as his main title, and adopted that of &quot;imperator&quot; (emperor), whereupon the title of tsarevich (and &quot;tsarevna&quot;, retained for life by Ivan V&#x27;s daughters) fell into disuse. The Emperor&#x27;s daughters were henceforth referred to as &quot;tsesarevna&quot; (Peter had no living son by this time). In 1762, upon succeeding to the imperial throne, Peter III accorded his only son Paul Petrovich (by the future Catherine the Great) the novel title of &quot;tsesarevich&quot;, he being the first of nine Romanov heirs who would bear it. However, at the time the title was conferred, Paul was recognised as Peter&#x27;s legal son, but not as his legal heir. Nor would he be officially recognised as such by his mother after her usurpation of the throne.

More often he was internationally referred to by his other title of &quot;Grand Duke&quot; (&quot;великий князь&quot;; the actual meaning in Russian language is &quot;Grand Prince&quot;. &quot;Grand Duke&quot;, a title not used, would have been &quot;великий герцог&quot; &quot;velikij gertsog&quot; from German Herzog, duke), which pre-dated &quot;tsesarevich&quot;, being a holdover from the Rurikid days before the grand dukes of Muscovy adopted the title of tsar. When Paul acceded to the throne in 1796, he immediately declared his son Aleksandr Pavlovich &quot;tsesarevich&quot;, and the title was confirmed by law in 1797 as the official title for the heir to the throne (incorporated into Article 145 of the Fundamental Laws). In 1799 Paul I granted the title &quot;tsesarevich&quot; to his second son Constantine Pavlovich, who, oddly, retained the title even after he renounced the throne in 1825 in favor of their younger brother, Nicholas I.

Thenceforth, each Emperor&#x27;s eldest son bore the title until 1894, when Nicholas II conferred it on his brother Grand Duke George Aleksandrovich, with the stipulation that his entitlement to it would terminate upon the birth of a son to Nicholas, who was then betrothed to Alix of Hesse. When George died in 1899, Nicholas did not confer the title upon his oldest surviving brother Michael Aleksandrovich, although Nicholas&#x27;s only son would not be born for another five years. That son, Alexei Nikolaevich (1904–1918), became the Russian Empire&#x27;s last &quot;tsesarevich&quot;.

=== Tsesarevich of Russia ===
===Tsesarevna of Russia===
The wife of an heir-tsesarevich bore the title Tsesarevna () – Grand Duchess. In first years of Russian Empire the female heirs of Peter I of Russia bore this title: his daughters Elizabeth of Russia (born 1709), Anna Petrovna (1708–1728) and Natalia Petrovna (1718–1725). This word is not to be confused with Tsarevna, used before 18th century for all the Tsar&#x27;s daughters and daughters-in-law.

Many princesses from Western Europe, who converted to Orthodox Christianity and changed their given names accordingly, were given the patronymic &quot;Fyodorovna&quot; not because their fathers were named &quot;Theodore&quot;, but as an allegory based on the name of Theotokos of St. Theodore, the patron icon of the Romanov family.
===Post-monarchy===
After claiming the Russian throne in exile in 1924 Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich designated his son, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich, &quot;Tsesarevich&quot;. Since 1997 the title has been attributed to Vladimir&#x27;s grandson, George Mikhailovich Romanov, whose mother, Maria Vladimirovna, conferred it on him in her capacity as pretender to the throne. Those who refer to him by a dynastic title, however, more usually address him as &quot;grand duke&quot;.

Until the end of the empire most people in Russia and abroad, verbally and in writing continued to refer to the Sovereign as &quot;tsar&quot;. Perhaps for that reason the title of &quot;tsesarevich&quot; was less frequently used to refer to the heir apparent than either &quot;tsarevich&quot; or &quot;grand duke&quot;.

<doc id="400274" wikidata="Q4664847" url="?curid=400274" title="Minoru Ōta">
<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II, and the final commander of the Japanese naval forces defending the Oroku Peninsula during the Battle of Okinawa.

==Biography==
Ōta was a native of Nagara, Chiba. He graduated 64th out of 118 cadets from the 41st class of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1913. Ōta served his midshipman duty on the cruiser on its long-distance training voyage to Honolulu, San Pedro, San Francisco, Vancouver, Victoria, Tacoma, Seattle, Hakodate and Aomori. After his return to Japan, he was assigned to the battleship , and after he was commissioned an ensign, to the battleship . After promotion to lieutenant in 1916, he returned to naval artillery school, but was forced to take a year off active service from November 1917 to September 1918 due to tuberculosis. On his return to active duty, he completed coursework in torpedo school and advanced courses in naval artillery. After brief tours of duty on the battleships and &quot;Fusō&quot;, he returned as an instructor at the Naval Engineering College.
Ōta also had experience with the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF, the Japanese equivalent of the Royal Marines), as he had been assigned command of a battalion of SNLF forces in the 1932 First Shanghai Incident. He was promoted to commander in 1934. In 1936, he was named executive officer of the battleship , and was finally given his first command, that of the oiler &quot;Tsurumi&quot; in 1937. He was promoted to captain in December the same year.

===World War II===
In 1938, with the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ōta was assigned to command the Kure 6th SNLF. In 1941, he was assigned to the command of the SNLF under the Japanese China Area Fleet at Wuhan in China. He returned to Japan the following year, and was assigned to command the 2nd Combined Special Naval Landing Force that was earmarked for the seizure of Midway in the event of a Japanese victory over the United States Navy at the Battle of Midway. Although this never came to pass, he was promoted to rear admiral and commanded the 8th Combined Special Naval Landing Force at New Georgia against the American First Raider Battalion. He then served in various administrative capacities until January 1945, when he was reassigned to Okinawa to command the Japanese Navy&#x27;s forces as part of the Japanese reinforcement effort prior to the anticipated invasion by Allied forces.

In Okinawa, Ōta commanded a force with a nominal strength of 10,000 men. However, half were civilian laborers conscripted into service with minimal training, and the remainder were gunners from various naval vessels with little experience in fighting on land. Allied sources are contradictory on his role as commander of the naval elements in Okinawa. Some cite Ōta as able to organize and lead them into an effective force, which fought aggressively against the Allied forces, &quot;withdrawing slowly back to the fortified Oroku Peninsula.&quot; But Naval elements, except for outlying islands were headquartered on the Oroku peninsula from the beginning of the battle. Operations Planning Colonel Hiromichi Yahara of the Japanese 32nd Army describes a miscommunication occurring in the order for Ota&#x27;s Naval elements to withdraw from the Oroku Peninsula to support the army further south. What actually happened is clear: Ōta began preparations on or around 24 May, for the withdrawal of all Naval elements to the south in support of the Army. He destroyed most heavy equipment, stocks of ammunition and even personal weapons. While in mid-march to the south, 32nd Army HQ ordered Ōta back into the Oroku peninsula citing that a mistake had been made in timing (explanations vary). Naval elements returned to their former positions with no heavy weapons and about half the troops had no rifles. The Americans, who had not noticed the initial withdrawal attacked and cut off the peninsula by attacks from the north on land, and one last seaborne landing behind the Navy&#x27;s positions. Naval elements then committed suicide with whatever weapons possible, with some leading a last charge out of the cave entrances. According to the museum for the underground Naval Headquarters in Okinawa, &quot;many soldiers committed suicide&quot; inside the command bunker, including Ōta.

On June 6, Commanding Officer Ota sent out a telegram to the Navy Vice admiral. On 11 June 1945, the U.S. 6th Marine Division encircled Ōta&#x27;s positions, and Ōta sent a farewell telegram to the IJA 32nd Army Headquarters at 16:00 on 12 June. On 13 June, Ōta committed suicide with a handgun. He was posthumously promoted to vice admiral.

==Telegraph to the Navy Vice Admiral==
(There are illegible parts.)

From the commander of Okinawa military
To the vice minister of Navy ministry

Please pass this telegram to vice minister (illegible).
Sent at 20:16 on the 6th of June, 1945:

&quot;Regarding the actual situation of Okinawa citizens, the prefectural governor should report it. But the prefectural office has already lost communication means and the 32nd Army Headquarters does not seem to have the excess communication capacity neither. So I will inform you of the situation in lieu of the governor although it was not requested from the prefectural governor to the Navy Headquarters. I simply can not overlook the current situation as it is.

Since the enemy began to attack the main island of Okinawa, the Navy and the Army devoted themselves to defensive warfare and could hardly look after the prefecture&#x27;s people.

However, as far as I can tell, among the prefectural people, all the young and middle-aged males responded fully to the defensive convocation altogether. 
Old men, children and women who were left behind to fend for themselves are now forced to lead starved miserable lives exposed to natural elements. They initially hid themselves in small air shelters dug in areas originally thought to be free from military operations after they had lost all their belongings, living quarters and household items, due to repetitive naval shelling and air raids. But these shelters also have been bombarded and so they have been forced to flee.

Despite the hardship, young women have taken the initiative to devote themselves to the military: many as nurses and cooks and some even offered to carry cannonballs and even serve in the sword-waving attack units.

Local civilians expect the ominous outcome once the enemy lands:, the old men and children shall be killed, and women shall be taken away to the enemy&#x27;s territory for nefarious purposes. So some parents have decided to leave their young daughters at the gates of military camps seeking military protection for them.

I should add the devotion of young female local nurses: they continue to help the seriously injured soldiers left behind after the military movement and medics are no longer available. The dedication of these nurses is very serious and I do not believe it is driven by an ephemeral feeling of sympathy.

Furthermore, I have seen people without transport means walk in the evening rain without complaints at all when a sudden and drastic change of the military strategy dictated that these civilians relocate to a far away place at short notice at night.

To sum up, despite consistent heavy burden of labor service and lack of goods all the time since the Imperial Navy and Army proceeded to establish the front line in Okinawa, (despite some bad rumors of a few parties) the local citizens devoted themselves to the loyal service as Japanese (illegible) without giving (illegible) Okinawa Islands will become scorched land where no single plant will remain unburned.

It is said that food shall be sufficient only up to the end of June.

The Okinawa citizens fought this way.
I would humbly request your esteemed preferred consideration to the prefectural people in the future&quot;.

<text>Jean Victor Audouin (27 April 1797 – 9 November 1841), sometimes Victor Audouin, was a French naturalist, an entomologist, herpetologist, ornithologist, and malacologist.

==Biography==
Audouin was born in Paris and was educated in the field of medicine. In 1824 he was appointed assistant to Pierre André Latreille, professor of entomology at the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle, where in 1833 he became Latreille&#x27;s successor. In 1838 he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences.

His principal work, &quot;Histoire des insectes nuisibles à la vigne&quot; (1842), was completed after his death by Henri Milne-Edwards and Émile Blanchard. Many of his papers appeared in the &quot;Annales des sciences naturelles&quot;, which, with Adolphe Theodore Brongniart and Jean-Baptiste Dumas, he founded in 1824, as well as in the proceedings of the Société entomologique de France, of which he was one of the founders in 1832. In 1833, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Audouin also contributed to other branches of natural history. With Brongniart and Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent, he was co-author of the &quot;Dictionnaire Classique d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot;, and with Henri Milne-Edwards, he collaborated on a study of marine animals found in French coastal waters. He also completed Marie Jules César Savigny&#x27;s ornithological section of &quot;Description de l&#x27;Egypte&quot; (1826). Audouin also studied amphibians and reptiles, and from 1827 to 1829 he described four new species of lizards and one new species of frog.

In 1843, mycologist David Gruby named the fungal species &quot;Microsporum audouinii&quot; after him. Audouin&#x27;s gull (&quot;Larus audouinii&quot;) is an ornithological species named in his honor, as is the red alga &quot;Audouinella&quot;, and in the French language, the term &quot;poche copulatrice d&#x27;Audouin&quot; (the copulatory pouch of Audouin) is another name for the spermatheca.

<text>Juliana &quot;Juli&quot; Furtado (born April 4, 1967, in New York City) is a retired American professional mountain biker, who began her sports career in skiing.

After knee injuries dashed her hopes of ski success, she took up cycling and won the US National Road Championship, and then went on to be very successful at mountain bike events - during her short 6-year career in MTB Furtado won five national titles and represented her country at the Olympics.

==Early life==
Born on April 4, 1967, her father&#x27;s parents were Portuguese from São Miguel Island. She started skiing at age two, and racing at age 9 after her family moved to Vermont, where Furtado attended the Stratton Mountain School.

At age 15 she became the youngest member of the U.S. National ski team, for which she competed from 1982 to 1987. After undergoing several knee operations, Furtado&#x27;s hopes of competing in the Olympics were forced to an end, and she attended University of Colorado Boulder on a skiing scholarship, where she received her BA in marketing. While racing for CU her knee injuries forced her to retire from competitive skiing, and Juliana switched to cycling.

==Cycling==
In 1989, her first year competing, Furtado won the US National Road Championship. She was then introduced to mountain biking, and in 1990, again her first year competing, she won the cross-country event (along with Ned Overend) in the first official Mountain Bike World Championship, held in Durango, Colorado. In 1992, she won the downhill world championship. In 1996, Furtado won both the World Cup (her 3rd WC championship) and the NORBA (U.S. National race authority) cross-country championships. She also participated in the Atlanta Olympics. Unfortunately, though she was the overwhelming favorite to win, she suffered in the severe Atlanta sun and heat due to the as yet undetected Lupus in her system and finished with an uncharacteristically slow 7th place. Soon after her Lupus was diagnosed, and again Furtado was forced into early retirement from her sport due to physical conditions. Her disease is currently under control, and she still rides.

==Women&#x27;s bikes==
After retiring, Furtado started a company to design and produce female specific MTB components, such as smaller diameter handlebars and grips, stems, and seats.

Her designs were eventually picked up by Santa Cruz Bikes. At the same time, Santa Cruz developed the first female-specific cross-country aluminum MTB called the &quot;Juliana&quot;. Furtado became the director of grass-roots sponsorship and marketing for Santa Cruz Bicycles, in Santa Cruz, California. In 2013, Furtado developed the concept for turning the single Juliana frame and associated components into a complete line of fully outfitted women&#x27;s mountain bikes, which would be a first for Santa Cruz, primarily a frame producer. The Juliana line has 5 models comprising one of the world&#x27;s largest women&#x27;s MTB ranges in the industry.

==Legacy==
In 1998, the book &quot;Rugged Racer&quot; was written about Juliana&#x27;s struggles and successes, overcoming injuries in pursuit of her dream to compete in the Olympics. Despite a short MTB career of 6 years, Juliana held a Guinness World Record for most career 1st-place finishes in MTB (male or female) and, at that time, her career total wins exceeded the combined total wins of the most successful man (Ned Overend) and next most successful woman.

She became the mother of a son in 2008 and is currently working again with the U.S. National ski team, as an advocate for retiring athletes.

Furtado was inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1993 and the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 2005.

<text>In Iran (Persia), Christianity dates back to the early years of the religion during the time of Jesus. Through this time the Christian faith has always been followed by a minority of the population of Iran under its different state religions: Zoroastrianism in ancient Persia, followed by Persian Shi&#x27;ism in the Middle Ages. However, Christians comprised a larger share of the population in the past than they do today. Iranian Christians have played a significant part in the historical Christian mission: currently, there are at least 600 churches and 300,000–370,000 converts.

== Major denominations ==
A number of Christian denominations are represented in Iran. Many members of the larger and older churches belong to minority ethnic groups, with the Armenians and Assyrians having their own distinctive culture and language. The members of the newer and smaller churches are drawn both from the traditionally Christian ethnic minorities and converts from a non-Christian background.

The main Christian churches in Iran are:

* Armenian Apostolic Church (between 110,000, 250,000, and 300,000 adherents)
* Assyrian Church of the East (about 11,000–20,000 adherents),
* Catholic Church (about 21,380 adherents) in three different rites.
** Chaldean Catholic Church (3,900 adherents as of 2014)
** Armenian Catholic Church and Latin Church
* Assyrian Evangelical Church Presbyterian
* Assyrian Pentecostal Church Pentecostal 
* Jamaʿat-e Rabbani (Iranian Assemblies of God)
* Anglican Diocese of Iran
According to Operation World, there are between 7,000 and 15,000 members and adherents of the various Protestant, Evangelical, and other minority Christian denominations in Iran.

In the 2016 census, the Statistical Center of Iran reported there were 117,700 Christians in the country; other reports put the figure at over half a million people. 

The &quot;Country Information and Guidance: Christians and Christian Converts, Iran&quot; report published in December 2014 by the U.K. Home Office states that there were 370,000 Christians in Iran.

== History ==


According to the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; there were Persians, Parthians and Medes among the first new Christian converts at Pentecost. Since then there has been a continuous presence of Christians in Iran.

During the apostolic age Christianity began to establish itself throughout the Mediterranean. However, a quite different Semitic-speaking Christian culture developed on the eastern borders of the Roman Empire and in Persia. Syriac Christianity owed much to preexistent Jewish communities and to the Aramaic language. This language had been spoken by Jesus, and, in various modern Eastern Aramaic forms is still spoken by the ethnic Assyrian Christians in Iran, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey and Iraq today (see Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, and Senaya language).

From Persian-ruled Assyria (Assuristan), missionary activity spread Eastern-Rite Syriac Christianity throughout Assyria and Mesopotamia, and from there into Persia, Asia Minor, Syria, the Caucasus and Central Asia, establishing the Saint Thomas Christians of India and erecting the Nestorian Stele and the Daqin Pagoda in China.

Early Christian communities straddling the Roman-Persian border found themselves in the midst of civil strife. In 313, when Constantine I proclaimed Christianity a tolerated religion in the Roman Empire, the Sassanid rulers of Persia adopted a policy of persecution against Christians, including the double-tax of Shapur II in the 340s. The Sassanids feared the Christians as a subversive and possibly disloyal minority. In the early-5th century official persecution increased once more. However, from the reign of Hormizd III (457–459) serious persecutions grew less frequent and the Persian church began to achieve a recognized status. Through the Battle of Avarayr (451) and the resultant treaty of 484, for example, the Persian Empire&#x27;s numerous Armenian subjects gained the official right to profess Eastern Christianity freely. Political pressure within Persia and cultural differences with western Christianity were mostly to blame for the Nestorian schism, in the course of which the Roman Empire church hierarchy labelled the Church of the East heretical. The bishop of Ctesiphon (the capital of the Sassanid Empire) acquired the title first of catholicos, and then patriarch, completely independent of any Roman/Byzantine hierarchy.

Some regard Persia as having very briefly been officially Christian. Khosrau I, Shahanshah from 531 to 579, married a Christian wife, and his son Nushizad was also a Christian. When the king was taken ill at Edessa a report reached Persia that he was dead, and at once Nushizad seized the crown and made the kingdom Christian ( 550). Very soon the rumour proved false, but people who appear to have been in the pay of Justinian persuaded Nushizad to endeavour to maintain his position. The actions of his son deeply distressed Khosrau; he had to take prompt measures, and sent the commander, Ram Berzin, against the rebels. In the battle which followed Nushizad was mortally wounded and carried off the field. In his tent he was attended by a Christian bishop, probably Mar Aba I, the Patriarch of the Church of the East from 540 to 552. To this bishop Nushizad confessed his sincere repentance for having taken up arms against his father, an act which, he was convinced, could never win the approval of Heaven. Having professed himself a Christian he died, and the rebellion was quickly put down.

Many old churches remain in Iran from the early days of Christianity. Some historians regard the Assyrian Church of Mart Maryam (St. Mary) in northwestern Iran, for example, as the second-oldest church in Christendom after the Church of Bethlehem in the West Bank. A Chinese princess, who contributed to its reconstruction in 642 AD, has her name engraved on a stone on the church wall. The famous Italian traveller Marco Polo also described the church following his visit.

The Arab Islamic conquest of Persia, in the 7th century, originally benefited Christians as they were a protected minority under Islam. However, from about the 10th century religious tension led to persecution once more. The influence of European Christians placed Near Eastern Christians in peril during the Crusades. From the mid-13th century, Mongol rule was a relief to Persian Christians until the Ilkhanate adopted Islam at the turn of the 14th century. The Christian population gradually declined to a small minority. Christians disengaged from mainstream society and withdrew into ethnic ghettos (mostly Assyrian and Armenian speaking). Persecution against Christians revived in the 14th century; when the Muslim warlord of Turco-Mongol descent Timur (Tamerlane) conquered Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Asia Minor, he ordered large-scale massacres of Christians in Mesopotamia, Persia, Asia Minor and Syria. Most of the victims were indigenous Assyrians and Armenians, members of the Assyrian Church of the East and of Orthodox Churches.

In 1445 a part of the Sureth-speaking Church of the East entered into communion with the Catholic Church (mostly in the Ottoman Empire, but also in Persia). This group had a faltering start but has existed as a separate church since Pope Julius III consecrated Yohannan Sulaqa as &quot;Chaldean Patriarch of Babylon&quot; in 1553. Most Assyrian Catholics in Iran today are members of the Chaldean Catholic Church. The community that remains independent is the Assyrian Church of the East, but both churches now have much smaller memberships in Iran than the Armenian Apostolic Church.

The number of Christians in Iran was further significantly boosted through various policies of the subsequent kingdoms that ruled from 1501. For example, in 1606 during the Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18), king Abbas I resettled some 300,000 Armenians deeper within modern-day Iran, as well as establishing their own quarter in the then-capital Isfahan, which is still largely populated by Christian Armenians some four centuries later: the New Julfa district. Other hundreds of thousands of Christian Georgians and Circassians were furthermore deported and resettled during the same Safavid era and in the later Qajar era within Iran, although both communities are exclusively Muslim nowadays.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Protestant missionaries began to evangelize in Persia. They directed their operations towards supporting the extant churches of the country while improving education and health-care. Unlike the older, ethnic churches, these evangelical Protestants began to engage with the ethnic Persian Muslim community. Their printing presses produced much religious material in various languages. Some Persians subsequently converted to Protestantism and their churches still exist within Iran (using the Persian language).

In the early 20th century, once again Iran&#x27;s stable and extant Christian population was boosted – this time due to the effects of the Assyrian genocide (1914–1924) and the Armenian genocide (1914–1923), as many tens of thousands of refugees poured in. However, both massacres drastically negatively affected Iran&#x27;s Christian population as well, as Ottoman troops crossed the Iranian border in the later stages of World War I and massacred many tens of thousands of Armenians and Assyrians within Iran&#x27;s borders as well, especially in West Azerbaijan Province, but also in adjacent provinces. Vibrant, huge and millennia-old native Christian communities in these parts of Iran were virtually shattered by the Ottoman actions, being reduced from formerly composing majorities in some of the regions, to very small – though noticeable – surviving communities. Prior to World War I and the Assyrian genocide, the population of Urmia was 40% to 50% Christian, for example. Nowadays, this number for the same city lies at 1% to 2%.

In 1918, during the Persian Campaign, about half of the Assyrians of Persia died in Turkish and Kurdish massacres and in related outbreaks of starvation and disease. About 80 percent of Assyrian clergy and spiritual leaders perished, threatening the nation&#x27;s ability to survive as a unit.

In 1976, the census reported that the Christian population of Iran holding citizenship there numbered 168,593 people, with most of them being Armenians. Due to the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, almost half of the Armenians migrated to the newly independent Armenia, but one estimate from 1999 placed the number as high as 310,000. Other estimates since 2000 have placed the number of Christians with Iranian citizenship as high as 109,415 in 2006.

Significant immigration of Assyrians from Iraq has been recorded during this period, due to massacres and harassment in post-Saddam Iraq. However, most of those Assyrians in Iran do not have Iranian citizenship, and therefore are not included in the data. In 2008, the central office of the International Union of Assyrians was officially transferred to Iran after being hosted in the United States for more than four decades.

The government guarantees the recognized Christian minorities a number of rights (production and sale of non-halal foods), representation in parliament, special family law etc. According to US-based Barnabas Fund government intrusion, expropriation of property, forced closure and persecution, particularly in the initial years after the Iranian Revolution, have all been documented.

On 2 February 2018, four United Nations human rights experts said that members of the Christian minority in Iran, particularly those who have converted to Christianity, are facing severe discrimination and religious persecution in Iran. They expressed their concerns over treatment of three Iranian Christians imprisoned in Iran.

Iranian Christians tend to be urban, with 50% living in Tehran.

Christianity remains the second-largest non-Muslim minority religion in the country.

A June 2020 online survey found a much smaller percentage of Iranians stating they believe in Islam, with half of those surveyed indicating they had lost their religious faith. The poll, conducted by the Netherlands-based GAMAAN (Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran), using online polling to provide greater anonymity for respondents, surveyed 50,000 Iranians and found 1.5% identified as Christians.

== Christian converts from Islam ==

Beginning in the 1970s, some Protestant pastors started to hold church services in homes in Persian, rather than in one of the ethnic Christian minority languages such as Armenian or Syriac. One of the key leaders who spearheaded this movement was the Assemblies of God bishop Haik Hovsepian Mehr. Worship in homes rather than in church buildings, and the utilization of the national language (Persian), which was spoken by nearly all Iranians, combined with dissatisfaction at violence connected to the Iranian Revolution, led to substantial numbers of Iranian Muslims converting from Islam to Christianity. This took place both within Iran and abroad, among the Iranian diaspora. It is currently illegal to distribute Christian literature in the official language, Persian.

Muslims who change their faith to Christianity are subject to societal and official pressure which may lead to the death penalty. Although the Civil Code does not provide explicitly for the death penalty – with the crime being punishable by fines, lashing, and prison terms – judges can impose the death penalty if they desire. Iran was number nine on Open Doors’ 2022 World Watch List, an annual ranking of the 50 countries where Christians face the most extreme persecution. 

Pentecostal pastor Hossein Sudmand was charged with apostasy and executed in 1990. Mehdi Dibaj was arrested and imprisoned for more than 10 years before he was sentenced to death in 1993, but after international pressure, he was freed in 1994, although the death sentenced was not lifted. He was murdered the next year. In 2011, Youcef Nadarkhani, an Jammiat-e Rabbani pastor, was allegedly sentenced to death for refusing to recant his faith. More recently the Iranian-American pastor and former Muslim Saeed Abedini, who in 2013 was sentenced to eight years prison, allegedly &quot;Helped to build the country&#x27;s underground Christian church network&quot;. Satellite TV networks, such as Mohabat TV, Sat7 Pars, and TBN Nejat TV, distribute educational and encouraging programs for Christians, especially targeting Persian speakers. Some Christian ex-Muslims emigrate from Iran for educational, political, security or economic reasons.

It is difficult to obtain accurate figures for Protestants of all denominations and Catholics in Iran. Complicating the matter is the mixture of ethnic identity with religious affiliation, and the number of Muslim converts to Christianity, who as discussed above have a strong incentive to conceal themselves. Most informants often referred to &quot;only a few thousand&quot; in estimating the overall numbers of non-ethnic Christians in Iran. According to the data from the mid 1990s, all Protestant churches in Iran claimed an ethnic and Iranian membership of 5,000, 8,000, 10,000 or 15,000. A 2015 study estimated (describing this as a conservative estimate) that there were 100,000 Christian believers from a Muslim background living in Iran, most of them evangelical or Pentecostal Christians. Significant numbers of Muslim converts to Christianity in Iran are estimated to range from 300,000 to 500,000 by various sources. Other estimates put the numbers between 800,000 and 3 million.

According to scholar Ladan Boroumand, &quot;Iran today is witnessing the highest rate of Christianization in the world.&quot; According to scholar Shay Khatiri of Johns Hopkins University, “Islam is the fastest shrinking religion in there [Iran], while Christianity is growing the fastest”, and in 2018 &quot;up to half a million Iranians are Christian converts from Muslim families, and most of these Christians are evangelicals.&quot; He adds that &quot;recent estimates claim that the number might have climbed up to somewhere between 1 million and 3 million&quot;.

In May 2019 Iran&#x27;s Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi expressed concern over Iranian Muslims converting to Christianity and said the Intelligence Ministry have dispatched agents active in &quot;countering the advocates of Christianity&quot; to areas where there is a potential for people to convert. In June 2024, it was reported that the Iranian judiciary sentenced five Christian converts to a total of over 25 years in prison.

== The Bible in languages of Iran ==
Armenian and Assyrian Christians use Bibles in their own languages.

Multiple Persian translations and versions of the Bible have been translated in more recent times, although distribution of Christian literature in Persian is currently illegal.

Portions of the Bible are translated into Azeri, Mazanderani, Gilaki, Bakhtiari, Luri, Kurdish (Kurmanji and Sorani).

==Freedom of religion==
In 2023, the country was given a score of zero out of four for religious freedom.

In the same year, it was ranked as the eighth most difficult place in the world to be a Christian.

<text>Poso (Old Spelling: &quot;Posso&quot;) is the administrative capital of Poso Regency, Indonesia. It is the main port and transportation hub for the central-southern coast of Central Sulawesi. Its urban area consists of three districts, Poso Kota, North Poso Kota, and South Poso Kota. Poso lies in the middle of the province on the shore of the Gulf of Tomini, right in the central part of Sulawesi Island. With a total population of 47,477 in 2020, it is one of the biggest and oldest towns in the province.

Poso began to develop as a small port town located at the mouth of the Poso River at the end of the 19th century—making it one of the oldest towns in Central Sulawesi, its presence was considered important for the Dutch to control the southern region of Tomini in the early days of their arrival. Poso was the administrative center of Landschap Poso, Onderafdeling Poso, and later Afdeling Poso during colonial times. Amid World War II, the Japanese made Poso one of their military posts. Post-independence, Poso was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Central Sulawesi in 1948 before the capital was moved to Palu in 1951.

Poso&#x27;s central location has historically made it a strategic stopover point for travelers moving between the north and south, as well as the west and east of Sulawesi. This has contributed to a diverse population, comprising various ethnicities, religions, and cultural backgrounds. The inhabitants are dispersed from coastal areas to the mountainous regions, with trade and services serving as the primary economic activities.

Poso is crossed by the Trans-Sulawesi National Highway and served by Kasiguncu Airport, linking it to other cities in Sulawesi such as Palu and Makassar.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Poso has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.
== Tourism and culture ==
Poso can be reached by plane from Palu or by bus from many other big cities on Sulawesi and is situated on the equator. It features tropical rain forest, seashore gardens, and other natural scenery. Sintuwu Maroso Square is the main town square and is located in central Poso. Rumah Katu Marine Park is a water park located 10 km from the center of Poso.

Modero is a well-known traditional dance that is performed during the celebration of rice harvesting (Padungku), usually in the evenings.

<text>Anthony Frederick Levin (born June 6, 1946) is an American musician and composer specializing in electric bass guitars, Chapman Stick and upright bass. He also sings and plays synthesizer. Levin is best known for his work with King Crimson (1981–2021) and Peter Gabriel (since 1977). He is also a member of Liquid Tension Experiment (1997–1999, 2008–2009, 2020–present), Bruford Levin Upper Extremities (1998–2000) and HoBoLeMa (2008–2010). He has led his own band, Stick Men, since 2010.

A prolific session musician since the 1970s, Levin has played on over 500 albums. Some notable sessions include work with John Lennon, Herbie Mann, Sarah McLachlan, Paula Cole, Stevie Nicks, Pink Floyd, Robbie Robertson, Eumir Deodato, Paul Simon, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Joan Armatrading, Tom Waits, Buddy Rich, The Roches, Todd Rundgren, Seal, Warren Zevon, Bryan Ferry, Laurie Anderson, Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, Gibonni, Chuck Mangione and Jean-Pierre Ferland. He has toured with artists including Paul Simon (with whom he appeared in the 1980 film &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot;), Gary Burton, James Taylor, Judy Collins, Carly Simon, Peter Frampton, Tim Finn, Richie Sambora, Ivano Fossati, Claudio Baglioni and Lawrence Gowan.

Levin helped to popularize the Chapman Stick and the NS electric upright bass. He also created &quot;funk fingers&quot;, modified drumsticks that attach to the fingers of the player in order to strike the bass strings, adding a distinctive percussive &quot;slap&quot; sound used in funk bass playing. In 2011, Levin ranked #2 behind John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin in the &quot;20 Most Underrated Bass Guitarists&quot; in &quot;Paste&quot; magazine. In July 2020, Levin was ranked #42 on the &quot;50 Greatest Bassists of All Time&quot; list by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Anthony Frederick Levin was born on June 6, 1946, in Boston, Massachusetts. He grew up in a Reform Jewish household in the suburb of Brookline. He began playing double bass at 10 years old, primarily studying classical music. In high school, he learned tuba, soloing with the concert band, and also started a barbershop quartet.

After high school, he attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York and played in the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra. Also at Eastman, he studied with drummer Steve Gadd. He traded in his Ampeg electric upright &quot;Baby Bass&quot; for a Fender Precision Bass; in the early days his first bass amplifier was an Ampeg Portaflex B-15. Levin&#x27;s first recording was in 1968, when he and Gadd played on &quot;Diana in the Autumn Wind&quot;, Gap Mangione&#x27;s first solo album.

=== 1970s–1980s ===
In 1970, Levin moved to New York City, joining a band called Aha, the Attack of the Green Slime Beast, with Don Preston of The Mothers of Invention. Soon after, he began working as a session musician, and through the 1970s he played bass on many albums, including Buddy Rich&#x27;s big band jazz album, &quot;The Roar of &#x27;74&quot;, and Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot; in 1975.

In 1971, John McLaughlin asked Levin to join his new project, the Mahavishnu Orchestra: &quot;My original choice for bass was Tony Levin. But he told me, &#x27;Oh man, I just took a gig with Gary Burton.&#x27;&quot; From 1973 to 1975, Levin and Steve Gadd played in the band of veteran jazz flautist Herbie Mann. Two of Levin&#x27;s early compositions (“Daffodil” and “Music Is a Game We Play”) were featured on the 1973 Mann album &quot;First Light&quot;.

In 1976, Levin helped create the lush textures on Andy Pratt&#x27;s &quot;Resolution&quot; album, which featured numerous notable musicians including Arif Mardin, Andy Newmark, Hugh McDonald, Luther Vandross, and Levin&#x27;s frequent rhythm section partner Steve Gadd. Allmusic.com and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine rated this album as one of the best singer/songwriter albums of the 1970s.

In 1977, Levin joined Peter Gabriel&#x27;s band. He had met Gabriel through producer Bob Ezrin with whom Levin had recorded Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to My Nightmare&quot; and Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Berlin&quot;. Levin has been Gabriel&#x27;s bass player of choice ever since. On Gabriel&#x27;s first solo album, Levin played tuba as well, and directed and sang with a barbershop quartet on &quot;Excuse Me&quot;. With the exception of John Giblin&#x27;s fretless bass playing on &quot;Peter Gabriel III&quot;, some additional work by Larry Klein on &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; &amp; &quot;Mercy Street&quot;, and Bill Laswell on &quot;This is the Picture&quot; (all three tracks from &quot;So&quot;), Levin has been the bassist on all of Gabriel&#x27;s studio sessions and on his many tours around the world. Gabriel nicknamed Levin the “Emperor of the Bottom End.”

In his years with Gabriel, Levin developed two unique aspects of his playing: further advancement on the Chapman Stick, which he would later utilize heavily in King Crimson, and invented funk fingers. Essentially, these are short drumsticks used to strike the bass strings, resulting in a very percussive effect. Levin credits Gabriel with the concept and his tech Andy Moore with actually making them workable.

In 1978, Levin moved to Woodstock, New York, to join the band L&#x27;Image, which included his old friend Steve Gadd as well as Mike Mainieri and Warren Bernhardt. The band broke up after a year, though Levin decided to stay in the area: he currently resides in Kingston, New York. This Ill-fated group would reunite much later in Levin&#x27;s career. On the first day of recording Peter Gabriel&#x27;s first album in late 1976, Levin met both Peter Gabriel and King Crimson guitarist/composer Robert Fripp for the first time, and in 1978 he played on Fripp&#x27;s solo album &quot;Exposure&quot;. This would lead Levin to become a member of the 1981–1984 incarnation of King Crimson, along with Fripp, guitarist/vocalist Adrian Belew, and drummer Bill Bruford. Levin recorded four studio albums as part of King Crimson:&quot; Discipline &quot;(1981),&quot; Beat&quot; (1982), &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; (1984) and&quot; THRAK&quot; (1995), all critically acclaimed. 

In 1980, Levin participated in the sessions for John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; album. In 1987, Levin played the bass and Chapman Stick parts on the Pink Floyd album &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;. In 1988 Bruford asked Levin to be an &quot;unofficial fifth member&quot; in the Yes-related supergroup Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, which consisted of all the members from the classic Yes lineup except bassist Chris Squire, though Levin only performed as a session player on the group&#x27;s eponymous album. Due to illness, he was unable to play on some of the final dates of the accompanying tour, being replaced by Jeff Berlin. Levin also played on the Yes album &quot;Union&quot; in 1991.

In 1984 Levin released &quot;Road Photos&quot;, a collection of black and white photos taken during his travels with King Crimson, Gabriel, Simon, and others. Another book of photos focusing on King Crimson&#x27;s travels in the 1980s, &quot;The Crimson Chronicles volume 1&quot;, was released in 2004. Levin has also written a book of career anecdotes and road stories called &quot;Beyond the Bass Clef&quot;.

=== 1990s–2000s ===

Levin was part of King Crimson again from 1994 to 1997 as part of the &quot;Double Trio&quot; line-up of the band which consisted of Levin, Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Trey Gunn, Pat Mastelotto, and Bill Bruford. Levin also took part in two of experimental King Crimson sub-groups: ProjeKct One (1997) and ProjeKct Four (1998). Levin played bass on &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; from Steve Hackett&#x27;s &quot;Genesis Revisited&quot; album (1996). He was very busy in the late 1990s with his own groups Bruford Levin Upper Extremities, Bozzio Levin Stevens, and Liquid Tension Experiment. 

In 1998, Levin and Bruford formed Bruford Levin Upper Extremities with trumpeter Chris Botti and guitarist David Torn; they released one studio album in 1998 and a live double album in 2000. Torn, Levin, and Bruford had worked with trumpeter Mark Isham for Torn&#x27;s album &quot;Cloud About Mercury&quot;. Levin also continued recording albums with his own band, consisting of drummer/saxophonist/vocalist Jerry Marotta, guitarist Jesse Gress, synthesizer programmer/player Larry Fast, and Levin&#x27;s brother, keyboardist Pete Levin. He also regularly played (and occasionally recorded) with the California Guitar Trio when their schedules permitted.

In 1997, Levin teamed up with Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci, members of Dream Theater, as well as future Dream Theater keyboardist Jordan Rudess, for a project called Liquid Tension Experiment. The combo released two albums, &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment&quot; and &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment 2&quot; in 1998 and 1999 respectively, as well as playing short tours in 1998 and 2008. There have also been two CDs of material released under the name &quot;Liquid Trio Experiment&quot;; the first composed of studio jams from sessions without Petrucci (&quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot;), released for the band&#x27;s tenth anniversary, and a live recording from a 2008 Chicago show where Rudess&#x27;s equipment failed and the other three covered for it with a nearly hour-long improvisation (&quot;When the Keyboard Breaks&quot;). During the COVID-19 global pandemic, the group reconvened and recorded &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment 3&quot;.

At the end of 2003 Trey Gunn left King Crimson and Levin rejoined as the bassist, although the band was only active for a handful of rehearsals at that time. In 2006, Levin released &quot;Resonator&quot;, The first album to feature Levin as a lyricist and lead vocalist. 2007 saw the release of &quot;Stick Man&quot;, an album of pieces recorded on the Chapman Stick. In 2008, Levin joined King Crimson&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Tour, in a lineup including Fripp, Belew, Mastelotto, and Harrison. He holds the record as King Crimson’s longest-serving bassist overall.

In 2009 Levin reunited with his band from 1978, L&#x27;Image, featuring Mike Mainieri, Warren Bernhardt, David Spinozza, and Steve Gadd. The group performed at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York City, toured Japan, and released the album &quot;L&#x27;Image 2.0&quot;. In 2010 Levin toured with HoBoLeMa, a group consisting of Allan Holdsworth on guitar, Terry Bozzio on drums, Levin on bass, and Pat Mastelotto on drums. All their shows were completely improvised with no written music.
Building upon the &quot;Stick Man&quot; album, Levin joined up with Michael Bernier and Pat Mastelotto to form the group Stick Men. The band released its first album &quot;Soup&quot; in 2010. Bernier left the group shortly after the release of &quot;Soup&quot; and was replaced by touch guitarist Markus Reuter. This lineup has continued with a busy touring and recording schedule, with their most recent recording &quot;Tentacles&quot; released in 2022.

Levin&#x27;s brother, Pete Levin, is a New York keyboardist and writer who is known for his work with Gil Evans. In the 1970s, Tony and Pete collaborated with Steve Gadd in the comedy band The Clams. Levin has stated that some of the Clams&#x27; material may eventually be released. Levin also played on Jean-Pierre Ferland&#x27;s &quot;Jaune&quot; album, which included hits &quot;Le petit roi&quot; and &quot;Le chat du café des artistes&quot;.

On September 24, 2013, Levin was officially announced as a member of the eighth incarnation of King Crimson, alongside band founder Robert Fripp, guitarist Jakko Jakszyk, the returning Mel Collins on saxophone, drummers Pat Mastelotto and Gavin Harrison, and new member Bill Rieflin. The group toured the United States in the autumn of 2014 and continued to tour throughout the world until 2021, including 2019 when King Crimson celebrated its 50th anniversary. 

In 2024, Levin and former King Crimson member Adrian Belew announced the creation of the supergroup Beat, which includes guitarist Steve Vai and drummer Danny Carey. With the approval of Robert Fripp, this group performs material from the early 1980s incarnation of King Crimson. In September 2024, Levin released the solo album &quot;Bringing It Down to the Bass&quot;, featuring guest appearances with many of his former bandmates and collaborators.

== Influence ==

Many artists have cited Levin as an influence or have expressed their admiration for him, including Les Claypool of Primus, Colin Hodgkinson, Nick Beggs, Al Barrow of Magnum, Dan Briggs of Between the Buried and Me, Zach Cooper of Coheed and Cambria and Jonathan Hischke of Dot Hacker and El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez Lopez.

== Personal life ==
Levin met Andi Turco in 1995 when she was promoting Virgin Records in Atlanta. They married three years later. Andi Turco-Levin ran for mayor of Kingston, New York, in 2011, and for Ulster County Legislature in 2019, both campaigns unsuccessful. Turco-Levin is credited with backing vocals on the album &quot;Resonator&quot; (2006) and for photography on &quot;Levin Minnemann Rudess&quot; (2013).
Levin has one child, filmmaker Maggie Levin.
In 2003, Levin stated that he is a vegetarian.

<doc id="400296" wikidata="Q4681340" url="?curid=400296" title="Additive Schwarz method">
<text>In mathematics, the additive Schwarz method, named after Hermann Schwarz, solves a boundary value problem for a partial differential equation approximately by splitting it into boundary value problems on smaller domains and adding the results.

== Overview ==

Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used in all sciences to model phenomena. For the purpose of exposition, we give an example physical problem and the accompanying boundary value problem (BVP). Even if the reader is unfamiliar with the notation, the purpose is merely to show what a BVP looks like when written down.

:(Model problem) The heat distribution in a square metal plate such that the left edge is kept at 1 degree, and the other edges are kept at 0 degree, after letting it sit for a long period of time satisfies the following boundary value problem:

::&quot;f&quot;&quot;xx&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) + &quot;f&quot;&quot;yy&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = 0 
::&quot;f&quot;(0,&quot;y&quot;) = 1; &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,0) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,1) = &quot;f&quot;(1,&quot;y&quot;) = 0

:where &quot;f&quot; is the unknown function, &quot;f&quot;&quot;xx&quot; and &quot;f&quot;&quot;yy&quot; denote the second partial derivatives with respect to &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, respectively.

Here, the domain is the square [0,1] × [0,1].

This particular problem can be solved exactly on paper, so there is no need for a computer. However, this is an exceptional case, and most BVPs cannot be solved exactly. The only possibility is to use a computer to find an approximate solution.

=== Solving on a computer ===

A typical way of doing this is to &quot;sample&quot; &quot;f&quot; at regular intervals in the square [0,1] × [0,1]. For instance, we could take 8 samples in the &quot;x&quot; direction at &quot;x&quot; = 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.8 and 0.9, and 8 samples in the &quot;y&quot; direction at similar coordinates. We would then have 64 samples of the square, at places like (0.2,0.8) and (0.6,0.6). The goal of the computer program would be to calculate the value of &quot;f&quot; at those 64 points, which seems easier than finding an abstract function of the square.

There are some difficulties, for instance it is not possible to calculate &quot;f&quot;&quot;xx&quot;(0.5,0.5) knowing &quot;f&quot; at only 64 points in the square. To overcome this, one uses some sort of numerical approximation of the derivatives, see for instance the finite element method or finite differences. We ignore these difficulties and concentrate on another aspect of the problem.

=== Solving linear problems ===

Whichever method we choose to solve this problem, we will need to solve a large linear system of equations. The reader may recall linear systems of equations from high school, they look like this:

:2&quot;a&quot; + 5&quot;b&quot; = 12 (*)
:6&quot;a&quot; − 3&quot;b&quot; = −3

This is a system of 2 equations in 2 unknowns (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;). If we solve the BVP above in the manner suggested, we will need to solve a system of 64 equations in 64 unknowns. This is not a hard problem for modern computers, but if we use a larger number of samples, even modern computers cannot solve the BVP very efficiently.

=== Domain decomposition ===

Which brings us to domain decomposition methods. If we split the domain [0,1] × [0,1] into two &quot;subdomains&quot; [0,0.5] × [0,1] and [0.5,1] × [0,1], each has only half of the sample points. So we can try to solve a version of our model problem on each subdomain, but this time each subdomain has only 32 sample points. Finally, given the solutions on each subdomain, we can attempt to reconcile them to obtain a solution of the original problem on [0,1] × [0,1].

==== Size of the problems ====

In terms of the linear systems, we&#x27;re trying to split the system of 64 equations in 64 unknowns into two systems of 32 equations in 32 unknowns. This would be a clear gain, for the following reason. Looking back at system (*), we see that there are 6 important pieces of information. They are the coefficients of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; (2,5 on the first line and 6,−3 on the second line), and the right hand side (which we write as 12,−3). On the other hand, if we take two &quot;systems&quot; of 1 equation in 1 unknown, it might look like this:

:System 1: 2&quot;a&quot; = 12
:System 2: -3&quot;b&quot; = −3

We see that this system has only 4 important pieces of information. This means that a computer program will have an easier time solving two 1×1 systems than solving a single 2×2 system, because the pair of 1×1 systems are simpler than the single 2×2 system. While the 64×64 and 32×32 systems are too large to illustrate here, we could say by analogy that the 64×64 system has 4160 pieces of information, while the 32×32 systems each have 1056, or roughly a quarter of the 64×64 system.

==== Domain decomposition algorithm ====

Unfortunately, for technical reasons it is usually not possible to split our grid of 64 points (a 64×64 system of linear equations) into two grids of 32 points (two 32×32 systems of linear equations) and obtain an answer to the 64×64 system. Instead, the following algorithm is what actually happens:

:1) Begin with an approximate solution of the 64×64 system.
:2) From the 64×64 system, create two 32×32 systems to improve the approximate solution.
:3) Solve the two 32×32 systems.
:4) Put the two 32×32 solutions &quot;together&quot; to improve the approximate solution to the 64×64 system.
:5) If the solution isn&#x27;t very good yet, repeat from 2.

There are two ways in which this can be better than solving the base 64×64 system. First, if the number of repetitions of the algorithm is small, solving two 32×32 systems may be more efficient than solving a 64×64 system. Second, the two 32×32 systems need not be solved on the same computer, so this algorithm can be run in &quot;parallel&quot; to use the power of multiple computers.

In fact, solving two 32×32 systems instead of a 64×64 system on a single computer (without using parallelism) is unlikely to be efficient. However, if we use more than two subdomains, the picture can change. For instance, we could use four 16×16 problems, and there&#x27;s a chance that solving these will be better than solving a single 64×64 problem even if the domain decomposition algorithm needs to iterate a few times.

== A technical example ==

Here we assume that the reader is familiar with partial differential equations.

We will be solving the partial differential equation

:&quot;u&quot;&quot;xx&quot; + &quot;u&quot;&quot;yy&quot; = &quot;f&quot; (**)

We impose boundedness at infinity.

We decompose the domain R² into two overlapping subdomains H1 = (− ∞,1] × R and H2 = [0,+ ∞) × R. In each subdomain, we will be solving a BVP of the form:

:&quot;u&quot;( &quot;j&quot; )&quot;xx&quot; + &quot;u&quot;( &quot;j&quot; )&quot;yy&quot; = &quot;f&quot; in H&quot;j&quot;
:&quot;u&quot;( &quot;j&quot; )(&quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)

where &quot;x&quot;1 = 1 and &quot;x&quot;2 = 0 and taking boundedness at infinity as the other boundary condition. We denote the solution &quot;u&quot;( &quot;j&quot; ) of the above problem by S(&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;). Note that S is bilinear.

The Schwarz algorithm proceeds as follows:

#Start with approximate solutions &quot;u&quot;( 1 )0 and &quot;u&quot;( 2 )0 of the PDE in subdomains H1 and H2 respectively. Initialize &quot;k&quot; to 0.
#Calculate &quot;u&quot;( &quot;j&quot; )&quot;k&quot; + 1 = S(&quot;f&quot;,&quot;u&quot;(3 − &quot;j&quot;)&quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;)) with &quot;j&quot; = 1,2.
#Increase &quot;k&quot; by one and repeat 2 until sufficient precision is achieved.

<text>County Durham, officially simply Durham (), is a ceremonial county in North East England. The county borders Northumberland and Tyne and Wear to the north, the North Sea to the east, North Yorkshire to the south, and Cumbria to the west. The largest settlement is Darlington.

The county has an area of and a population of . The latter is concentrated in the east; the south-east is part of the Teesside built-up area, which extends into North Yorkshire. After Darlington (92,363), the largest settlements are Hartlepool (88,855), Stockton-on-Tees (82,729), and Durham (48,069). For local government purposes the county comprises three unitary authority areas—County Durham, Darlington, and Hartlepool—and part of a fourth, Stockton-on-Tees. The county historically included the part of Tyne and Wear south of the River Tyne, and excluded the area south of the River Tees.

The west of the county contains part of the North Pennines uplands, a national landscape. The hills are the source of the rivers Tees and Wear, which flow east and form the valleys of Teesdale and Weardale respectively. The east of the county is flatter, and the two rivers meander through it; the Tees forms the boundary with North Yorkshire in its lower reaches, and the Wear exits the county near Chester-le-Street in the north-east. The county&#x27;s coast is a site of special scientific interest characterised by tall limestone and dolomite cliffs.

What is now County Durham was on the border of Roman Britain, and contains survivals of this era at sites such as Binchester Roman Fort. In the Anglo-Saxon period the region was part of the Kingdom of Northumbria. In 995 the city of Durham was founded by monks seeking a place safe from Viking raids to house the relics of St Cuthbert. Durham Cathedral was rebuilt after the Norman Conquest, and together with Durham Castle is now a World Heritage Site. By the late Middle Ages the county was governed semi-independently by the bishops of Durham and was also a buffer zone between England and Scotland. County Durham became heavily industrialised in the nineteenth century, when many collieries opened on the Durham coalfield. The Stockton and Darlington Railway, the world&#x27;s first public railway to use steam locomotives, opened in 1825. Most collieries closed during the last quarter of the twentieth century, but the county&#x27;s coal mining heritage is remembered in the annual Durham Miners&#x27; Gala.

==Toponymy==
The ceremonial county is officially named &quot;Durham&quot;, but the county has long been commonly known as &quot;County&quot; Durham and it is the only English county name prefixed with &quot;County&quot; in common usage (a practice common in Ireland). Its unusual naming (for an English shire) is explained to some extent by the relationship with the Bishops of Durham, who for centuries governed Durham as a county palatine (the County Palatine of Durham) outside the usual structure of county administration in England.

Early attestations of the county name include &quot;Dunelmensischira&quot; (Durhamshire) from c. 1100 and &quot;Comitatus Dunelmensis&quot; (County Durham) from 1344.

The situation regarding the formal name in modern local government is less clear:
*The 2009 structural change legislation created the present unitary council (that covers a large part – but not all – of the ceremonial county) refers to &quot;the county of County Durham&quot; and names the new unitary district &quot;County Durham&quot; too. 
**A later amendment to that legislation refers to the &quot;county of Durham&quot; and the amendment allows for the unitary council to name itself &quot;The Durham Council&quot;. 
*The council retains the name as Durham County Council. With either option, the name does not include &quot;County&quot; Durham.
*The former postal county was named &quot;County Durham&quot; to distinguish it from the post town of Durham.

==History==
===Anglian Kingdom of Bernicia===

Around AD 547, an Angle named Ida founded the kingdom of Bernicia after spotting the defensive potential of a large rock at Bamburgh, upon which many a fortification was thenceforth built. Ida was able to forge, hold and consolidate the kingdom; although the native British tried to take back their land, the Angles triumphed and the kingdom endured.

===Kingdom of Northumbria===

In AD 604, Ida&#x27;s grandson Æthelfrith forcibly merged Bernicia (ruled from Bamburgh) and Deira (ruled from York, which was known as Eforwic at the time) to create the Kingdom of Northumbria. In time, the realm was expanded, primarily through warfare and conquest; at its height, the kingdom stretched from the River Humber (from which the kingdom drew its name) to the Forth. Eventually, factional fighting and the rejuvenated strength of neighbouring kingdoms, most notably Mercia, led to Northumbria&#x27;s decline. The arrival of the Vikings hastened this decline, and the Scandinavian raiders eventually claimed the Deiran part of the kingdom in AD 867 (which became Jórvík). The land that would become County Durham now sat on the border with the Great Heathen Army, a border which today still forms the boundaries between the historic counties of Yorkshire and County Durham.
Viking settlement petered out at the Tees and the lands north thereof lay outside of the Danelaw. The House of Bamburgh, successors of the Kings of Bernicia and Northumbria, retained control north of the Tyne; between the Tyne and the Tees emerged the Community of St. Cuthbert or &quot;Haliwerfolc&quot;, successors of the See of Lindisfarne. The House of Wessex absorbed the Kingdom of York into the unified English Kingdom in 954 and claimed overlordship over Northumbria. However, the lands north of the Tees remained outside the governmental frontiers of the English realm, thus Bamburgh and the Haliwerfolc went on to become contested buffer states between England and Scotland.

===City of Durham founded===

In AD 995, St Cuthbert&#x27;s community, who had been transporting Cuthbert&#x27;s remains around, partly in an attempt to avoid them falling into the hands of Viking raiders, settled at Dunholm (Durham) on a site that was defensively favourable due to the horseshoe-like path of the River Wear. St Cuthbert&#x27;s remains were placed in a shrine in the White Church, which was originally a wooden structure but was eventually fortified into a stone building.

Once the City of Durham had been founded, the Bishops of Durham gradually acquired the lands that would become County Durham. Bishop Aldhun began this process by procuring land in the Tees and Wear valleys, including Norton, Stockton, Escomb and Aucklandshire in 1018. In 1031, King Canute gave Staindrop to the Bishops. This territory continued to expand, and was eventually given the status of a liberty. Under the control of the Bishops of Durham, the land had various names: the &quot;Liberty of Durham&quot;, &quot;Liberty of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Land&quot; &quot;the lands of St Cuthbert between Tyne and Tees&quot; or &quot;the Liberty of Haliwerfolc&quot; (holy Wear folk).

The bishops&#x27; special jurisdiction rested on claims that King Ecgfrith of Northumbria had granted a substantial territory to St Cuthbert on his election to the see of Lindisfarne in 684. In about 883 a cathedral housing the saint&#x27;s remains was established at Chester-le-Street and Guthfrith, King of York granted the community of St Cuthbert the area between the Tyne and the Wear, before the community reached its final destination in 995, in Durham.

Following the Norman invasion, the administrative machinery of government extended only slowly into northern England. Northumberland&#x27;s first recorded Sheriff was Gilebert from 1076 until 1080 and a 12th-century record records Durham regarded as within the shire. However the bishops disputed the authority of the sheriff of Northumberland and his officials, despite the second sheriff for example being the reputed slayer of Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots. The crown regarded Durham as falling within Northumberland until the late thirteenth century.

===County Palatine of Durham===

Matters regarding the bishopric of Durham came to a head in 1293 when the bishop and his steward failed to attend proceedings of &quot;quo warranto&quot; held by the justices of Northumberland. The bishop&#x27;s case went before parliament, where he stated that Durham lay outside the bounds of any English shire and that &quot;from time immemorial it had been widely known that the sheriff of Northumberland was not sheriff of Durham nor entered within that liberty as sheriff. . . nor made there proclamations or attachments&quot;. The arguments appear to have prevailed, as by the fourteenth century Durham was accepted as a liberty which received royal mandates direct. In effect it was a private shire, with the bishop appointing his own sheriff. The area eventually became known as the &quot;County Palatine of Durham&quot;.

Sadberge was a liberty, sometimes referred to as a county, within Northumberland. In 1189 it was purchased for the see but continued with a separate sheriff, coroner and court of pleas. In the 14th century Sadberge was included in Stockton ward and was itself divided into two wards. The division into the four wards of Chester-le-Street, Darlington, Easington and Stockton existed in the 13th century, each ward having its own coroner and a three-weekly court corresponding to the hundred court. The diocese was divided into the archdeaconries of Durham and Northumberland. The former is mentioned in 1072, and in 1291 included the deaneries of Chester-le-Street, Auckland, Lanchester and Darlington.

The term &quot;palatinus&quot; is applied to the bishop in 1293, and from the 13th century onwards the bishops frequently claimed the same rights in their lands as the king enjoyed in his kingdom.

===Early administration===
====Overview====
The historic boundaries of County Durham included a main body covering the catchment of the Pennines in the west, the River Tees in the south, the North Sea in the east and the Rivers Tyne and Derwent in the north. The county palatinate also had a number of liberties: the Bedlingtonshire, Islandshire and Norhamshire exclaves within Northumberland, and the Craikshire exclave within the North Riding of Yorkshire. In 1831 the county covered an area of and had a population of 253,910. These exclaves were included as part of the county for parliamentary electoral purposes until 1832, and for judicial and local-government purposes until the coming into force of the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, which merged most remaining exclaves with their surrounding county. The boundaries of the county proper remained in use for administrative and ceremonial purposes until the Local Government Act 1972.

====Early English and Norman period====
Following the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror appointed Copsig as Earl of Northumbria, thereby bringing what would become County Durham under Copsig&#x27;s control. Copsig was, just a few weeks later, killed in Newburn. Having already being previously offended by the appointment of a non-Northumbrian as Bishop of Durham in 1042, the people of the region became increasingly rebellious. In response, in January 1069, William despatched a large Norman army, under the command of Robert de Comines, to Durham City. The army, believed to consist of 700 cavalry (about one-third of the number of Norman knights who had participated in the Battle of Hastings), entered the city, whereupon they were attacked, and defeated, by a Northumbrian assault force. The Northumbrians wiped out the entire Norman army, including Comines, all except for one survivor, who was allowed to take the news of this defeat back.

Following the Norman slaughter at the hands of the Northumbrians, resistance to Norman rule spread throughout Northern England, including a similar uprising in York. William The Conqueror subsequently (and successfully) attempted to halt the northern rebellions by unleashing the notorious Harrying of the North (1069–1070). Because William&#x27;s main focus during the harrying was on Yorkshire, County Durham was largely spared the Harrying. The best remains of the Norman period include Durham Cathedral and Durham Castle, and several parish churches, such as St Laurence Church in Pittington. The Early English period has left the eastern portion of the cathedral, the churches of Darlington, Hartlepool, and St Andrew, Auckland, Sedgefield, and portions of a few other churches.

====Palatinate====
Until the 15th century, the most important administrative officer in the Palatinate was the steward. Other officers included the sheriff, the coroners, the Chamberlain and the chancellor. The palatine exchequer originated in the 12th century. The palatine assembly represented the whole county, and dealt chiefly with fiscal questions. The bishop&#x27;s council, consisting of the clergy, the sheriff and the barons, regulated judicial affairs, and later produced the Chancery and the courts of Admiralty and Marshalsea.

The prior of Durham ranked first among the bishop&#x27;s barons. He had his own court, and almost exclusive jurisdiction over his men. A UNESCO site describes the role of the bishops in Durham, the &quot;buffer state between England and Scotland&quot;:

From 1075, the Bishop of Durham became a Prince-Bishop, with the right to raise an army, mint his own coins, and levy taxes. As long as he remained loyal to the king of England, he could govern as a virtually autonomous ruler, reaping the revenue from his territory, but also remaining mindful of his role of protecting England&#x27;s northern frontier.

A report states that the Bishops also had the authority to appoint judges and barons and to offer pardons.

There were ten palatinate barons in the 12th century, most importantly the Hyltons of Hylton Castle, the Bulmers of Brancepeth, the Conyers of Sockburne, the Hansards of Evenwood, and the Lumleys of Lumley Castle. The Nevilles owned large estates in the county. John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby rebuilt Raby Castle, their principal seat, in 1377.

Edward I&#x27;s &quot;quo warranto&quot; proceedings of 1293 showed twelve lords enjoying more or less extensive franchises under the bishop. The repeated efforts of the Crown to check the powers of the palatinate bishops culminated in 1536 in the Jurisdiction in Liberties Act 1535, which deprived the bishop of the power to pardon offences against the law or to appoint judicial officers. Moreover, indictments and legal processes were in future to run in the name of the king, and offences to be described as against the peace of the king, rather than that of the bishop. In 1596 restrictions were imposed on the powers of the chancery, and in 1646 the palatinate was formally abolished. It was revived, however, after the Restoration, and continued with much the same power until 5 July 1836, when the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. 19) provided that the palatine jurisdiction should in future be vested in the Crown.

====Wars====
During the 15th-century Wars of the Roses, Henry VI passed through Durham. On the outbreak of the Great Rebellion in 1642 Durham inclined to support the cause of Parliament, and in 1640 the high sheriff of the palatinate guaranteed to supply the Scottish army with provisions during their stay in the county. In 1642 the Earl of Newcastle formed the western counties into an association for the King&#x27;s service, but in 1644 the palatinate was again overrun by a Scottish army, and after the Battle of Marston Moor (2 July 1644) fell entirely into the hands of Parliament.

====Parliamentary representation and secular powers====
In 1614, a Bill was introduced in Parliament for securing representation to the county and city of Durham and the borough of Barnard Castle. The bishop strongly opposed the proposal as an infringement of his palatinate rights, and the county was first summoned to return members to Parliament in 1654. After the Restoration of 1660 the county and city returned two members each. In the wake of the Reform Act 1832 the county returned two members for two divisions, and the boroughs of Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland acquired representation. The bishops lost their secular powers in 1836. The boroughs of Darlington, Stockton and Hartlepool returned one member each from 1868 until the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

==Geography==

===Urban===
The historic county excludes the village of Startforth, the ceremonial county excludes the city of Sunderland and the non-metropolitan county excludes the town of Stockton-on-Tees. The ceremonial county includes the non-metropolitan county with the addition of the boroughs of Darlington, Hartlepool, and Stockton-on-Tees. The historic county&#x27;s boundaries stretched from the rivers Tyne to Tees and it is covered by the ceremonial county, the city of Sunderland, the boroughs of Gateshead and South Tyneside, while the non-metropolitan county includes part of Yorkshire.

County Durham contains a small area of the North East Green Belt in the county&#x27;s north; surrounding the city of Durham, Chester-le-Street and other communities along the shared county border with Tyne and Wear, avoiding Wearside&#x27;s spread west. A smaller green belt separates Urpeth, Ouston, Pelton, and Perkinsville from Birtley in Tyne and Wear. A further small segment by the coast separates Seaham from the Sunderland settlements of Beckwith Green and Ryhope. It was first drawn up in the 1990s.

===Geology===

County Durham is underlain by Carboniferous rocks in the west. Permian and Triassic strata overlie these older rocks in the east. These sedimentary sequences have been cut by igneous dykes and sills.

The county contains a sizeable area of the North Pennines, designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, primarily west of Tow Law and Barnard Castle. The highest point (county top) of historic County Durham is the trig point (not the summit) of Burnhope Seat, height , between Weardale and Teesdale on the border with historic Cumberland in the far west of the county. The local government reorganisation of 1974 placed the higher Mickle Fell south of Teesdale (the county top of Yorkshire) within the administrative borders of Durham (where it remains within the ceremonial county). However, it is not generally recognised as the highest point in Durham.

The two main dales of County Durham (Teesdale and Weardale) and the surrounding fells, many of which exceed in height, are excellent hillwalking country, although not nearly as popular as the nearby Yorkshire Dales and Lake District national parks. The scenery is rugged and remote, and the high fells have a landscape typical of the Pennines with extensive areas of tussock grass and blanket peat bog in the west, with heather moorland on the lower slopes descending to the east.

===Climate===
The following climate figures were gathered at the Durham weather station between 1981 and 2010:

==Governance==

County Durham, as considered a county for lieutenancy purposes by the Lieutenancies Act 1997, is administered as a part of the constituent country of England in the United Kingdom. The area is appointed a lord lieutenant and a high sheriff.

The ceremonial county is divided into four districts (see table below), one of which – Stockon-on-Tees – also extends into North Yorkshire. For administrative purposes, the County of Durham only consists of the area governed by Durham County Council. The three other areas are counties in their own right.

The county is partially parished. The city of Durham is the most populous settlement in the county to have a parish. Multiple parishes are styled as having town councils: Billingham (in Stockton Borough), Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland, Chilton, Ferryhill, Great Aycliffe, Newton Aycliffe, Greater Willington, Peterlee, Seaham, Sedgefield, Shildon, Spennymoor, Stanley and Tow Law.

===1836 to 1974===
The county was aligned to other historic counties of England from 1836 until 1889; multiple acts were passed removing exclaves, splitting the county from the bishopric and reforming its structure.

The ceremonial county and administrative county were created under the Local Government Act 1888 in 1889. Darlington, Gateshead, West Hartlepool (later known as Hartlepool), South Shields and Sunderland became county boroughs during the administrative counties years of administrating; each remained in the ceremonial county while outside of the administrative county.

The ceremonial county remained under the same borders as the historic county until 1968 when the County Borough of Teesside formed. Ceremonial duties of the borough (which were made up of areas from two counties) were in the North Riding of Yorkshire ceremonial county.

===1974 to present===
From the 1974 until 1996, the ceremonial county was split into eight districts:
*Chester-le-Street, including the Lumley, Pelton and Sacriston areas
*Derwentside, including Consett and Stanley
*City of Durham, including Durham and the surrounding areas
*Easington, including Seaham and Peterlee
*Borough of Sedgefield, including Spennymoor, Sedgefield and Newton Aycliffe
*Teesdale, including Barnard Castle and the villages of Teesdale
*Wear Valley, including Bishop Auckland, Crook, Willington, Hunwick, and the villages along Weardale
*Borough of Darlington, Darlington along with nearby villages around the town.
A non-metropolitan county replaced the administrative county. The boundaries only deviated from the ceremonial boundaries after 1995 when the Darlington Borough became a unitary authority.

On the 1 April 1996, the county of Cleveland was abolished with its boroughs of Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees (north of the River Tees) becoming a part of the ceremonial county.

The non-metropolitan county was reconstituted on 1 April 2009: the strategic services-providing Durham County Council was re-organised into a single district of the same name, merging with the seven local facility-providing districts in the non-metropolitan county and became structured as a unitary authority. It has 126 councillors. The three pre-existing unitary authorities were unaffected.

===Parliament===
The county boundaries used for parliamentary constituencies were originally those used between 1974 and 1996, consisting of the County Durham district and the Darlington Borough, until boundary changes in 2024. This area elects eight Members of Parliament. County Durham itself elects six of them, and as of the 2024 general election, all of these MPs are Labour. The rest of the ceremonial county is included in the Cleveland parliamentary constituency area.

==Emergency services==
The police and fire services operate according to the 1974-96 ceremonial county boundaries:
* Durham Constabulary, Ron Hogg was first elected the Durham Police and Crime Commissioner for the force on 15 November 2012, and held the position until his death in office in 2019. 
*Cleveland Police
* County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service, it is under supervision of a combined fire authority consisting of 25 local councillors: 21 from Durham County Council and 4 from Darlington Borough Council.
*Cleveland Fire Brigade.

The North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust cover North East England and are responsible for providing ambulance services for the NHS. Northumbria Ambulance Service and County Durham Ambulance Service (following historic county borders) merged on 1 April 1999 to become the North East service. In 2005 the area was adapted to the modern North East England regional extent.

Air ambulance services are provided by the Great North Air Ambulance. The charity operates three bases, including one in Eaglescliffe.

Teesdale and Weardale Search and Mountain Rescue Team, are based at Sniperly Farm in Durham City and respond to search and rescue incidents in the county.

==Demography==
===Population===
The Office for National Statistics estimated in 2016 that the Durham County Council area had a population of 522,100, the Borough of Darlington a population of 105,600, the Borough of Hartlepool a population of 92,800, and the part of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham (the other part being in North Yorkshire) a population of 137,300. This gives the total estimated population of the ceremonial county at 857,800.

===Employment===
The proportion of the population working in agriculture fell from around 6% in 1851 to 1% in 1951; currently less than 1% of the population work in agriculture. There were 15,202 people employed in coal mining in 1841, rising to a peak of 157,837 in 1921.

===Settlements===

County Durham has a mostly rural character, especially in the west. Small population centres scatter between Durham, Crook, Bishop Auckland, Shildon, Newton Aycliffe, Sedgefield and Peterlee. These places were populated by the draw of collieries during the Industrial Revolution. The south east side of the county Between Hartlepool and Darlington form part of Teesside with settlements on the south side of the river. While the north east part of the county (on the border with Tyne and Wear) forms part of Tyneside and Wearside.

===Changes===
====Former non-metropolitan county====
At the 2001 Census, Easington and Derwentside districts had the highest proportion (around 99%) in the county council area of resident population who were born in the UK. 13.2% of the county council area&#x27;s residents rate their health as &quot;not good&quot;, the highest proportion in England.

96.6% of County Durham&#x27;s residents are White British, with other white groups making up a further 1.6% of the population. Around 77% of the county&#x27;s population are Christian whilst 22% have no religion, and around 1% come from other religious communities. These figures exclude around 6% of the population who did not wish to state their religion.

As at 2001, Chester-le-Street district has the lowest number of available jobs per working-age resident (0.38%).

===1900s===
Since the Local Government Act 1972 historic county boundaries now lie within other administrative counties. These include:
===1800s===

Throughout the 1800s exclaves, of the historic county, each were given back to surrounding shires and lands they were closer associated with:
==Economy==
===Economic output===
The chart and table summarise unadjusted gross value added (GVA) in millions of pounds sterling for County Durham across 3 industries at current basic prices from 1995 to 2004.

===Businesses===

==Culture==
===Mining and heavy industry===
A substantial number of colliery villages were built throughout the county in the nineteenth century to house the growing workforce, which included large numbers of migrant workers from the rest of the UK. Sometimes the migrants were brought in to augment the local workforce but, in other cases, they were brought in as strike breakers, or &quot;blacklegs&quot;. Tens of thousands of people migrated to County Durham from Cornwall (partly due to their previous experience of tin mining) between 1815 and the outbreak of the First World War, so much so that the miners&#x27; cottages in east Durham called &quot;Greenhill&quot; were also known locally as &quot;Cornwall&quot;, and Easington Colliery still has a Cornish Street. Other migrants included people from Northumberland, Cumberland, South Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Coal mining had a profound effect on trade unionism, public health and housing, as well as creating a related culture, language, folklore and sense of identity that still survives today.
The migrants also were employed in the railway, ship building, iron, steel and roadworking industries, and the pattern of migration continued, to a lesser extent, up until the 1950s and 1960s. Gateshead was once home to the fourth-largest Irish settlement in England, Consett&#x27;s population was 22% Irish and significant numbers of Irish people moved to Sunderland, resulting in the city hosting numerous events on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day due to the Irish heritage.

The culture of coal mining found expression in the Durham Miners&#x27; Gala, which was first held in 1871, developed around the culture of trade unionism. Coal mining continued to decline and pits closed. The 1984–1985 United Kingdom miners&#x27; strike involved many miners across the county. Today no deep-coal mines exist in the county and numbers attending the Miners&#x27; Gala decreased over the period between the end of the strike and the 21st century. However recent years have seen numbers significantly grow, and more banners return to the Gala each year as former colliery communities restore or replicate former banners to march at the Gala parade.

===Art===
In 1930, the Spennymoor Settlement (otherwise known as the Pitman&#x27;s Academy) opened. The settlement, initially funded by the Pilgrim Trust, aimed to encourage people to be neighbourly and participate in voluntary social service. The settlement operated during the Great Depression, when unemployment was widespread and economic deprivation rife; Spennymoor was economically underprivileged. The settlement provided educational and social work, as well as hope; this included providing unemployed miners with on outlet for their creativity, a poor person&#x27;s lawyer service, the town&#x27;s first library and the Everyman Theatre. The output included paintings, sewing, socially-significant plays, woodwork and sculptures. Several members went on to win adult scholarships at Oxford University when such a route would normally be closed to the underprivileged. Former members include artists Norman Cornish and Tom McGuinness, writer Sid Chaplin and journalist Arnold Hadwin. The Spennymoor Settlement at its home in the Everyman Theatre (Grade 2 listed) is still operating, administered by the current trustees, offering community events and activities, including Youth Theatre Group, an Art Group and various classes, as well as offering community accommodation facilities.
Several Durham miners have been able to turn their former mining careers into careers in art. For example, Tom Lamb, as well as the aforementioned Tom McGuinness and Norman Cornish. Their artworks depict scenes of life underground, from the streets in which they lived and of the people they loved; through them, we can see, understand and experience the mining culture of County Durham.
In 2017, The Mining Art Gallery opened in Bishop Auckland in a building that was once a bank. Part of the Auckland Project, the gallery includes the work of artists from within County Durham and beyond, including such other North-Eastern mining artists as Robert Olley, as well as contributions from outside the region. It features three permanent areas and a temporary exhibition area; the gallery&#x27;s Gemini Collection includes 420 pieces of mining art.
 Much of the artwork was donated, by Dr Robert McManners and Gillian Wales, for example.
In 2019, 100 years after his birth, a permanent tribute to the work of the artist Norman Stansfield Cornish MBE was opened within the Town Hall, and a Cornish Trail around the town was established to include areas of the town depicted in Cornish&#x27;s artwork.

===Music===
As with neighbouring Northumberland, County Durham has a rich heritage of Northumbrian music, dating back from the Northumbrian Golden Age of the 7th and 8th centuries. Bede made references to harp-playing, and abundant archeological evidence has been found of wooden flutes, bone flutes, panpipes, wooden drums and lyres (a six-string form of harp). North-East England has a distinctive folk music style that has drawn from many other regions, including southern Scotland, Ireland and the rest of northern England, that has endured stably since the 18th century. Instruments played include, in common with most folk music styles, stringed instruments such as the guitar and fiddle, but also the Northumbrian smallpipe, which is played and promoted by people including the Northumbrian Pipers&#x27; Society throughout the North East, including County Durham, with the society having an active group in Sedgefield. Contemporary folk musicians include Jez Lowe and Ged Foley.
In 2018, The Arts Council funded the Stories of Sanctuary project in the city of Durham. The project aims to assist people living in the city to share their stories about seeking sanctuary in the North East through photography, stories, poetry and music. The art is based on a history of sanctuary in Durham, from St Cuthbert&#x27;s exile, through to the miners&#x27; strike of 1984, and to refugees escaping civil war in the Middle East. The music produced as part of the project includes contributions from singer-songwriter Sam Slatcher and viola player Raghad Haddad from the National Syrian Orchestra.
Other notable performers/songwriters who were born or raised in the county include Paddy McAloon, Eric Boswell, Jeremy Spencer, Alan Clark, Martin Brammer, Robert Blamire, Thomas Allen, Zoe Birkett, John O&#x27;Neill, Karen Harding and Courtney Hadwin.

===Flag===
County Durham has an unofficial flag, registered with the vexillological charity the Flag Institute on 21 November 2013. The flag consists of St Cuthbert&#x27;s cross counterchanged with the county&#x27;s blue and gold colours.
Katie, Holly and James Moffatt designed the flag and entered their design into a competition launched by campaigner Andy Strangeway, who spoke of the flag as &quot;&quot;free, public symbol for all to use, especially on 20th March each year, which is not only County Durham Day but also St Cuthbert’s birthday”&quot; (20 March is actually the date of Cuthbert&#x27;s death).

<text>Haik Hovsepian Mehr (; January 6, 1945, Tehran – January 19, 1994) was an Iranian Armenian Protestant minister and bishop of the &quot;Jama&#x27;at-e Rabbani&quot; church (part of the Assemblies of God church movement). After the Islamic Revolution of 1979, he was one of the few Christian leaders to continue to evangelize. In 1994, he disappeared after protesting the Iranian government&#x27;s treatment of converts to Christianity and is generally assumed to have been murdered by the state. The state, however, accuses the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran for his murder.

==Early life==
Hovsepian was born in 1945 in Tehran, Iran into an Armenian Apostolic middle-class family. He had three younger brothers: Edward, Roubik and George. When he was 15, he joined the Pentecostal Assemblies of God. In 1966, upon completion of his mandatory military service, Haik married Takoosh Ginagosian. In 1967, he pastored his first church in Majidieh, a suburb of the capital Tehran. Not long afterwards, he served in the military and was stationed in Gorgan, a city in Mazanderan, a northern province of Iran near the Caspian Sea, where he established a house church.

In 1969 Hovsepian, his wife and their six-month-old child were driving from Tehran to Gorgan with an American missionary family, when their car struck an unlit tractor-trailer. The four children aboard were killed. The adult passengers survived, but Hovsepian and Takoosh suffered broken legs, from which they recovered.

==Christian ministry==
They returned to Gorgan, where they served in church pastoral work despite hardship and persecution. 
Hovsepian had a strong motivation to evangelise Iranian Muslims. He was an outspoken Christian apologist, evangelist and a gifted musician.

He was responsible for initiating increased collaboration between evangelical churches within Iran after the Iranian Revolution. He became the Chairman of the Council of Protestant Ministers of Iran.

Hovsepian spoke up for the rights of Christians in Iran. In 1993 he was one of only two church leaders to refuse to sign a declaration stating that they would not allow Muslims or Muslim converts into their churches. He also refused to sign a statement that Christians enjoyed full rights in Iran. He compiled a detailed report on violations of religious freedom and invited Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, the United Nations Special Representative to Iran, to visit the country and meet Protestant ministers and government officials to discuss these violations. He also met the Ministry for Islamic Guidance for Minorities to call for the government to respect the rights of religious minorities set out in the 1979 Constitution. Bishop Hovsepian and the denomination he represented, the Assemblies of God, were ordered to comply with the following directives: 
# Church services could not be held in Persian, the official language of Iran; 
# Church members must be issued membership cards and produce them upon attendance; 
# Membership lists, complete with addresses, must be handed over to governmental authorities; 
# Meetings must be confined to Sunday, not Friday the officially recognized day of Muslim worship; 
# Only members could attend Sunday meetings; and 
# New members could only be added to the membership and admitted to meetings once the Ministry of Information and Islamic Guidance had been notified. 
Haik deliberately disobeyed and defiantly declared that &quot;Never would [he or his ministers] bow down and comply with such inhumane and unjust demands&quot; and that &quot;our churches are open to all who want to come in.&quot;

He was killed after protesting about the treatment of his friend and colleague Mehdi Dibaj at the hands of the Iranian government. Hovsepian mounted a campaign for Dibaj, and on January 16, 1994, Dibaj was released. Three days later Hovsepian vanished from Tehran. His death was reported to his family on January 30, 1994. While the government initially denied all involvement, Iranian Christians and independent observers claimed that he was murdered for his beliefs.

==Arresting two suspects==
On July 5, 1994, a few days after 1994 Imam Reza shrine bomb explosion, and months after Hovsepian Mehr&#x27;s murder two women who were allegedly from People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran and were going to bomb Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini and Fatima Masumeh Shrine were arrested. In a TV interview, one of them related Hovsepian Mehr&#x27;s murder to People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran.

Abdelfattah Amor, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance made a visit to Iran in 1995 where he was able to speak freely in Evin prison with the women charged with murder of Hovsepian Mehr and two other Christian leaders. Amor concluded in his UN report that the Iranian Government had apparently decided to execute Bishop Hovsepian Mehr and two other Christian leaders in order not only to discredit the Mujahedin organization by declaring it responsible for those crimes, but also, to decapitate the Protestant community.

==Legacy==
Takoosh and her four children (Rebekkah, Joseph, Gilbert, and Andre) eventually migrated to California, to be surrounded by a large diaspora of Armenians and Persians, including family members and friends from Tehran. Takoosh and her children are frequently asked to speak at conferences, and their children are in different Christian ministries. Haik&#x27;s brothers, who work as pastors, are also ministering outside Iran.

<text>Dilip Kumar (born Muhammad Yusuf Khan; 11 December 1922 – 7 July 2021) was an Indian actor, writer, ghost director and film producer, who worked in Hindi cinema. Credited with pioneering method acting in cinema, he dominated Hindi cinema from the 1950s throughout the 1960s, being referred to as &quot;Abhinay Samrat&quot; (Hindi for &quot;Emperor of Acting&quot;). Kumar holds the record for most wins for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (eight, which was later equalled by Shah Rukh Khan) and was also the inaugural recipient of the award. He holds the most dominant box-office record for a star (male or female) in Hindi cinema with over 80% box-office successes and several long-standing gross records.

In a career spanning over five decades, Kumar worked in 57 films in a variety of roles. He debuted as an actor in the film &quot;Jwar Bhata&quot; (1944), produced by Bombay Talkies. Following a series of unsuccessful ventures, he had his first box office hit in &quot;Jugnu&quot; (1947). Kumar found further success with the romantic drama &quot;Andaz&quot; (1949), the swashbuckling &quot;Aan&quot; (1952), the social drama &quot;Daag&quot; (1952), the actioner &quot;Insaniyat&quot; (1955), the comical &quot;Azaad&quot; (1955), the romantic social &quot;Naya Daur&quot; (1957), the noir mystery &quot;Madhumati&quot; (1958), the social drama &quot;Paigham&quot; (1959), the action adventure &quot;Kohinoor&quot; (1960), the epic historical &quot;Mughal-E-Azam&quot; (1960), the crime drama &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; (1961), and the comedy drama &quot;Ram Aur Shyam&quot; (1967). All three &quot;Andaz&quot;, &quot;Aan&quot; and &quot;Naya Daur&quot; briefly became the highest-grossing Indian films up to that point, a feat later achieved by &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot;, which sustained the record for 15 years.

The 1970s saw Kumar&#x27;s career take a downturn, marked by three consecutive commercial failures, namely &quot;Dastaan&quot; (1972), &quot;Sagina&quot; (1974) and &quot;Bairaag&quot; (1976). Post-1976, he went on a brief hiatus from film performances and returned with the revolutionary drama &quot;Kranti&quot; (1981), which was the highest-grossing Indian film of the year. He continued to play leading roles in films such as &quot;Vidhaata&quot; (1982), &quot;Shakti&quot; (1982), &quot;Karma&quot; (1986), and &quot;Saudagar&quot; (1991). His last on-screen appearance was in the commercially unsuccessful &quot;Qila&quot; (1998), which saw him in a dual role. Kumar later served as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India&#x27;s parliament, from 2000 to 2006.

Kumar&#x27;s personal life was the subject of much media attention, however, he himself had largely avoided media limelight and endorsements. He was in a long-term relationship with actress and frequent co-star Madhubala that ended after the &quot;Naya Daur&quot; court case in 1957. He married actress Saira Banu in 1966 and resided in Bandra, a suburb of Mumbai, until his death in 2021. For his contributions to film, the Government of India awarded him with the Padma Bhushan in 1991 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015, the country&#x27;s third and second-highest civilian awards respectively. He was also awarded India&#x27;s highest accolade in the field of cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1994. In 1998, the Government of Pakistan conferred Kumar with Nishan-e-Imtiaz, their highest civilian decoration, making him the only Indian to have received the honour. The house that Kumar grew up in, located in Peshawar, was declared a national heritage monument in 2014 by the Pakistani government.

==Early life==
Dilip Kumar was born Muhammad Yusuf Khan on 11 December 1922, into an Awan Hindkowan Muslim family at his family home in the Qissa Khawani Bazaar neighbourhood of Peshawar, a city in the North-West Frontier Province of British India. He was one of the twelve children of Lala Ghulam Sarwar Ali Khan (1890–1950) and his wife Ayesha Begum (1897–1948). His father was a fruit merchant.

Khan was schooled at the Barnes School in Deolali (now in Maharashtra), where his father owned orchards. He grew up in the same neighbourhood in Peshawar as Raj Kapoor, his childhood friend, and later his colleague in the film industry. In 1940, he moved to Pune and set up a dry fruit supply shop and a canteen. Despite hailing from Peshawar, Khan&#x27;s family decided to remain in Bombay following the Partition of India in 1947.

Khan never acted under his birth name, debuting in &quot;Jwar Bhata&quot; in 1944 under the stage name Dilip Kumar. In his autobiography, &quot;Dilip Kumar: The Substance and the Shadow&quot;, he wrote that the name was a suggestion from Devika Rani, who was one of the producers on &quot;Jwar Bhata&quot;. In an interview in 1970, he said that he adopted this name out of fear of his father, who never approved of his acting career because of the general poor image of cinema back then.

==Career==
===1940s: First film roles and initial success===

Kumar&#x27;s first film was &quot;Jwar Bhata&quot; in 1944, which went unnoticed. After two more unsuccessful films, it was his fourth film &quot;Jugnu&quot; (1947), in which he starred alongside Noor Jehan, that became his first major hit at the box office. His next major hits were the 1948 films &quot;Shaheed&quot; and &quot;Mela&quot;. Both &quot;Jugnu&quot; and &quot;Shaheed&quot; were the highest grossing Hindi films of their respective year of release.

He got his breakthrough role as an actor in 1949 with Mehboob Khan&#x27;s , in which he starred alongside Raj Kapoor and Nargis. At the time of its release, was the highest-grossing Indian film ever, until its record was broken by Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Barsaat&quot; that same year. &quot;Shabnam&quot; was another box office hit that was also released in 1949.

===1950s and 1960s: Superstardom===
The 1950s was Kumar&#x27;s most successful and prolific decade with him playing leading roles in several box office hits such as &quot;Jogan&quot; (1950), &quot;Babul&quot; (1950), &quot;Deedar&quot; (1951), &quot;Tarana&quot; (1951), &quot;Daag&quot; (1952), &quot;Aan&quot; (1952), &quot;Uran Khatola&quot; (1955), &quot;Insaniyat&quot; (1955), &quot;Devdas&quot; (1955), (1957), &quot;Yahudi&quot; (1958), &quot;Madhumati&quot; (1958) and &quot;Paigham&quot; (1959). 
He formed popular on-screen pairings with many of the top actresses at the time including Vyjayanthimala, Madhubala, Nargis, Nimmi, Meena Kumari and Kamini Kaushal.
Together with fellow contemporaries Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand, he dominated the 1950s which is considered a part of the golden era of Hindi cinema. Though the three did not appear in any one film together, Kumar did appear with Raj Kapoor in (1949) and Dev Anand in &quot;Insaniyat&quot; (1955).
Several of his films established his screen image as the &quot;Tragedy King&quot;. Kumar briefly suffered from depression due to portraying many tragic roles and on the advice of his psychiatrist, he also took on light-hearted roles. Mehboob Khan&#x27;s big-budget 1952 swashbuckling musical &quot;Aan&quot; featured him in one of his first lighter roles and marked his first film to be shot in technicolor. &quot;Aan&quot; was the first Indian film to have a wide release across Europe with a lavish premiere in London. &quot;Aan&quot; was the highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time, domestically and overseas. He had further success with lighter roles as a thief in the hit comedy &quot;Azaad&quot; (1955). In 1957, he appeared in the third segment of the anthology film &quot;Musafir&quot;, which was the directorial debut of Hrishikesh Mukherjee. He also did playback singing for a song in the film with Lata Mangeshkar.

By this time, he had developed his distinct, signature style of understated acting of mumbling his dialogues while giving myriad expressions and meanings to lines that his characters uttered.

He was the first actor to win the Filmfare Best Actor Award (for &quot;Daag&quot;) and went on to win it a further seven times. 9 of his 21 films in the 1950s were ranked in the Top 30 highest-grossing films of the decade.

In the 1950s, Kumar became the first Indian actor to charge 1.5 lakh per film.(equal to 60 cr or above of 2024)
In 1960, he portrayed Prince Salim in K. Asif&#x27;s big-budget epic historical film &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot;, which was the highest-grossing film in Indian film history for 15 years until it was surpassed by the 1975 film &quot;Sholay&quot;.

&quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; was in the making for over a decade and was originally shot in black and white, with only two songs and the climax scenes shot in colour. 44 years after its original release, it was fully colourised and theatrically re-released in 2004 and was once again a box office success. That same year he played another lighter role in the musical comedy &quot;Kohinoor&quot; which was also among the highest grossers of the year.

In 1961, Kumar wrote, produced, and starred in the dacoit drama &quot;Ganga Jamuna&quot; opposite his brother Nasir Khan, playing the title role. Kumar produced the film under his production company Citizens Films and despite it being the highest-grossing film of the year, it would be the only film he produced. Though the directing credit went to the veteran director Nitin Bose, it was rumoured that Kumar had ghost directed the film as well as being involved in every aspect of its production. He chose the shade of saree that his co-star Vyjayanthimala would wear in every scene. The film received the National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film in Hindi, the Paul Revere Silver Bowl at the Boston International Film Festival, the Special Honour Diploma from the Czechoslovak Academy of Arts in Prague, and the Special Prize at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.

In 1962, British director David Lean offered him the role of &quot;Sherif Ali&quot; in his film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), but Kumar declined to perform in the movie. The role eventually went to Omar Sharif, the Egyptian actor. Kumar commented in his much later released autobiography, &quot;he thought Omar Sharif had played the role far better than he himself could have&quot;. Kumar was also being considered for a leading role opposite Elizabeth Taylor in a film that Lean was working on called &quot;Taj Mahal&quot;, before the project was cancelled.

After a three-year hiatus, he returned with his next film &quot;Leader&quot; (1964) which underperformed at the box office and ended up being only an average grosser. Kumar was also credited with writing the story of this film. His next film &quot;Dil Diya Dard Liya&quot; (1966), based on Wuthering Heights was Kumar&#x27;s first box office failure in more than a decade. It was also rumoured that he had ghost directed the film but the final credit was given to Abdul Rashid Kardar. In 1967, Kumar played a dual role of twins separated at birth in the hit film &quot;Ram Aur Shyam&quot;. In 1968, he starred alongside Manoj Kumar in &quot;Aadmi&quot; which was an average grosser at the box office. That same year, he starred in &quot;Sunghursh&quot; which was also a box office failure.

===1970s: Slump and hiatus===
In 1970, Kumar played the title role in &quot;Gopi&quot; which marked his first pairing with his wife Saira Banu and was a box office success. That same year, he acted opposite Banu again in the Bengali language film &quot;Sagina Mahato&quot;. This was his only appearance in a Bengali film. In 1972, he once again played dual roles as twin brothers in &quot;Dastaan&quot; which was a box office flop and began a decline in Kumar&#x27;s career as a leading man. A Hindi remake of &quot;Sagina Mahato&quot;, simply titled &quot;Sagina&quot; was made in 1974 with both Kumar and Banu reprising their roles which also failed to do well at the box office. In 1976, he played triple roles as a father and twin sons in &quot;Bairaag&quot;. Though his performance in triple roles was acclaimed, the film was his third consecutive failure at the box office. He personally regarded M. G. Ramachandran&#x27;s performance in &quot;Enga Veettu Pillai&quot; better than his role in &quot;Ram Aur Shyam&quot;. He regards his performance in &quot;Bairaag&quot; much higher than that of &quot;Ram Aur Shyam&quot;. The rise of actors like Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjeev Kumar led to Kumar losing film offers from 1970 to 1980. He took a five-year hiatus from films from 1976 to 1981.

===1980s: Return to success===
In 1981, he returned to films, reinventing himself in elderly character roles. His comeback film was the star-studded historical epic &quot;Kranti&quot; which was the biggest hit of the year. Appearing alongside an ensemble cast including Manoj Kumar, Shashi Kapoor, Hema Malini and Shatrughan Sinha, he played the title role as revolutionary fighting for India&#x27;s independence from British rule. In the post-&quot;Kranti&quot; phase, Kumar reinvented himself to play the &quot;Angry Old Man&quot; to great effect in a series of films like &quot;Vidhaata&quot; (1982), &quot;Shakti&quot; (1982), &quot;Duniya&quot; (1984), etc. In 1982, he collaborated with the director Subhash Ghai for the first time with &quot;Vidhaata&quot;, in which he starred alongside Sanjay Dutt, Sanjeev Kumar and Shammi Kapoor. &quot;Vidhaata&quot; was the highest-grossing film of the year. Later that year he starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in Ramesh Sippy&#x27;s &quot;Shakti&quot;, which was an average grosser at the box office, but won him critical acclaim and his eighth and final Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 1984, he starred in Yash Chopra&#x27;s social crime drama &quot;Mashaal&quot; opposite Anil Kapoor, which failed at the box office, but his performance was critically acclaimed. He also appeared alongside Rishi Kapoor in &quot;Duniya&quot; (1984) and Jeetendra in &quot;Dharm Adhikari&quot; (1986).

His second collaboration with Subhash Ghai came with the 1986 ensemble action film &quot;Karma&quot;. &quot;Karma&quot; marked the first film which paired him opposite fellow veteran actress Nutan, although they were paired in an incomplete and unreleased film in the 1950s titled &quot;Shikwa&quot;. He acted opposite Nutan again in the 1989 action film &quot;Kanoon Apna Apna&quot; which also reunited him with Sanjay Dutt.

===1990s: Directorial debut and final works===
In 1990, he co-starred with Govinda in the action thriller &quot;Izzatdaar&quot;. In 1991, Kumar starred alongside fellow veteran actor Raaj Kumar in &quot;Saudagar&quot;, his third and last film with director Subhash Ghai. This was his second film with Raaj Kumar after 1959&#x27;s &quot;Paigham&quot;. &quot;Saudagar&quot; was to be Kumar&#x27;s penultimate film and last box office success. In 1994, he won the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the industry.

In 1991, producer Sudhakar Bokade who had previously worked with Kumar in &quot;Izzatdaar&quot; announced a film titled &quot;Kalinga&quot; which would officially mark Kumar&#x27;s directorial debut after he had allegedly previously ghost-directed &quot;Ganga Jamuna&quot; (1961) and &quot;Dil Diya Dard Liya&quot; (1967). Kumar was also set to star in the title role with the cast including Raj Babbar, Raj Kiran, Amitoj Mann and Meenakshi Seshadri. After being delayed for several years &quot;Kalinga&quot; was eventually shelved in 1996 with 70% filming completed.

In 1998, Kumar made his last film appearance in the box office flop &quot;Qila&quot;, where he played dual roles as an evil landowner who is murdered and as his twin brother who tries to solve the mystery of his death.

===2000s–2021: Shelved projects and political career===
In 2001, Kumar was set to appear in a film titled &quot;Asar – The Impact&quot; alongside Ajay Devgan and Priyanka Chopra, which was shelved due to Kumar&#x27;s declining health. He was also set to appear in Subhash Ghai&#x27;s war film &quot;Mother Land&quot;, alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, but this film was shelved after Khan decided to leave the project.

His classic films &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; and were fully colourised and re-released in cinemas in 2004 and 2008 respectively. An unreleased film he had shot and completed titled &quot;Aag Ka Dariya&quot; was set for a theatrical release in 2013 but has not been released to date.

Kumar was a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India&#x27;s parliament, from 2000 to 2006. He was nominated by the Indian National Congress to represent Maharashtra. Kumar utilised a significant portion of his MPLADS fund towards the construction and improvement of the Bandstand Promenade and the gardens at Bandra Fort at Lands End in Bandra.

==Personal life==
Kumar and Madhubala were drawn to each other during the shooting of &quot;Tarana&quot; (1951). They were in a relationship for seven years until the Naya Daur court case, during which Kumar testified against Madhubala and her father, ending their relationship. They never worked together again after &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960). Kumar later expressed in his autobiography, &quot;Was I in love with Madhubala as the newspapers and magazines reported at that time? As an answer to this oft-repeated question straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth, I must admit that I was attracted to her both as a fine co-star and as a person who had some of the attributes I hoped to find in a woman at that age and time...She, as I said earlier, was very sprightly and vivacious and, as such, she could draw me out of my shyness and reticence effortlessly.&quot; However, Kumar shared in his biography that contrary to popular notion, Madhubala&#x27;s father Ataullah Khan wasn&#x27;t opposed to their match but instead, wanted to turn this marriage into a business venture which did not land well with him.

In the late 1950s, Vyjayanthimala was linked by gossip magazines to Kumar, who has acted with her the most compared to any other actress, which resulted in great on-screen chemistry between them. While working for his home production &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; (1961), Kumar reportedly handpicked the shade of sari that Vyjayanthimala would wear in every scene.

In 1966, Kumar married actress Saira Banu, who was 22 years younger than him. He later married Hyderabad socialite Asma Rahman, taking her as a second wife in 1981. That marriage ended in January 1983. Banu and he lived in Bandra. They did not have any children. In his autobiography, &quot;Dilip Kumar: The Substance and the Shadow&quot;, he revealed that Banu had conceived in 1972, but developed complications in the pregnancy, leading to a miscarriage. Following this, they did not try to have children again, believing it to be God&#x27;s will.

Kumar was fluent in his native Hindko, in his later years aiming to establish a Hindko Academy in Peshawar in order to safeguard the language, as well as Urdu, Hindi, English, Punjabi, Marathi, Pashto and Farsi. He was also a great music enthusiast and also learnt how to play the sitar for a film. He loved cricket and played it often. He led a cricket team against Raj Kapoor in a friendly cricket match held for charity. Both growing up in Peshawar and in Bombay, Dilip Kumar and his family had a close relationship with the Kapoor family.

His younger brother Nasir Khan (1924–1974) was also a noted film actor. Two of his younger brothers, Aslam Khan (1932 - 2020) and Ehsan Khan (1930 - 2020), died after testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020, within a space of two weeks.

== Death ==
Kumar died at Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai, on 7 July 2021 at 7:30 am, aged 98, after a prolonged illness. He had been suffering from several age-related issues and was diagnosed with pleural effusion. The Government of Maharashtra approved his burial with state honours under COVID-19 restrictions at the Juhu Muslim Cemetery that same day.

Expressing their condolences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated in a tweet that Kumar would be remembered as a cinematic legend, while the President, Ram Nath Kovind, stated that &quot;he was loved across the subcontinent&quot;. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, also expressed condolences for his death and remembered his efforts in raising funds for the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital in a tweet. and the former President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai also expressed condolences to Kumar and his family.

== Artistry and legacy ==
Kumar is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema, and cinema in general. Kumar was a pioneer of method acting, predating Hollywood method actors such as Marlon Brando. He inspired many great Indian cinema actors from contemporaries like Balraj Sahni to succeeding generations of artists, including Rajendra Kumar, Manoj Kumar, Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kamal Haasan, Aamir Khan, Naseeruddin Shah, Nawazuddin Siddiqui among others. Kumar, who pioneered his own form of method acting without any acting school experience, was described as &quot;the ultimate method actor&quot; by renowned filmmaker Satyajit Ray, despite not having worked with him.

A part of the &quot;Trinity – The Golden Trio&quot; (along with Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand), Kumar was popularly referred to as &quot;Abhinay Samrat&quot; (Hindi for &quot;Emperor of Acting&quot;) by the audience. He was also dubbed in the media as &quot;&quot;Tragedy King&quot; because of the acclaimed dramatic roles he took early in his career and is also retrospectively known as &quot;The First Khan&quot;&quot; of Bollywood. Other than these, of recent, he is often referred in the media as &quot;The Kohinoor of Indian cinema&quot;. Kumar was the biggest Indian star of the 1950s and 1960s era, a national icon and the country&#x27;s highest paid actor during this period. His prolific period as a leading artist coincides with what retrospectively came to be known as the &quot;Golden Age of Hindi cinema&quot;, with him playing a key role in its legacy. Film historian Maithili Rao states, &quot;He towered like a mountain in the middle of Hindi film history, obscuring his predecessors and dwarfing his contemporaries.&quot;

He is retrospectively recognised as &quot;The First Superstar of Indian cinema&quot;. He became one of the earliest and most revered stars in the history of Indian cinema having legions of fans across the subcontinent and among the South Asian diaspora worldwide. In 2013, on the occasion of the centenary of Indian cinema, he was declared the &quot;Biggest superstar of all time&quot; by Filmfare in its poll of the same title.

As of 2020, he is by far, the most successful Bollywood star of all time with over 80% box-office successes and numerous gross records. Kumar appeared in &quot;Box Office India&quot;″s &quot;Top Actors&quot; list nineteen times from 1947 to 1965. He topped the list sixteen times (1948–1963). Trade analysts have acknowledged that many of his films were commercially successful despite their heavy theme and non-commercial nature because the masses gathered in cinemas across India only to see him act, a unique feat as anything such hasn&#x27;t happened with any other actor. This had been particularly apparent in the late 1940s and early 1950s, a period in which he got the title of &quot;Tragedy King&quot; in media outlets. In the review of the last film of his initial phase, the 1976 musical &quot;Bairaag&quot;, The Hindu, remarked, &quot;For more than 25 years Dilip Kumar was the king at the box office. His name was almost a guarantee of success not only at the time of the release of the film but even in re-runs his films made more money than fresh releases of many of his contemporaries.&quot; Renowned director, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, called him &quot;a phenomenon at the time&quot;, stating all his films had the hype, &quot;he was absolutely a one-man industry&quot;.

In the second phase of his career, which saw him playing mature roles that were the main leads of his films, often driving them to immense success, &quot;Box Office India&quot; notes, &quot;This was the part of his illustrious career which sets him apart from all other actors as no one else has managed to such success as a character artist.&quot; Renowned actor Irrfan Khan, remarked, &quot;Till date, no other actor has had that kind of an impact on people&#x27;s hearts. The kind of combination he brought along – of an actor and a star – was never seen before him. It started with him, and ended with him. His career, his working style, his personal lifestyle or his choice of films, nothing sets a wrong example. He is a true legend. These days, the word ″&quot;legend&quot;″ is used loosely, but I strongly believe that he is the only one who deserves to be called &quot;the legend&quot;&quot;.

== Accolades ==
Kumar, Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand together formed &quot;the golden trio&quot; of Indian cinema in the 1950s and 1960s, with the camaraderie between the three contemporary actors, all renowned for their own style. Kumar was the biggest Indian star of this era, a national icon, holding the status of a matinée idol. He was the country&#x27;s highest-paid actor during this period.

From the independence of India in 1947 to the late 2010s, Kumar held the record of performing in the highest number of highest-grossing films of the year (9 films), until his record was broken by Salman Khan, who performed in 10 such films. However, as per new reports from Box Office India, highest grossing Indian film in 1991 was Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Saudagar&quot; (1991) instead of Khan&#x27;s &quot;Saajan&quot; (1991), thus perhaps re-establishing his record.

He is the only actor in India to have delivered at least one bonafide &quot;hit&quot; at the box office for 15 years straight, from 1947 to 1961. He also did not give a single flop in a period of 15 years from 1952 to 1965. According to many sources, he is the only Indian actor to have more than one film (3 or 4) among the top 10 highest-grossing films of Indian cinema when adjusted for ticket-price inflation. These films are (1957), &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960), &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; (1961), and &quot;Kranti&quot; (1981).

Over his career, Kumar received eight Filmfare Awards for Best Actor (with 19 total nominations), the most of any actor (and was also its inaugural recipient), and a Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award (1993). He holds the record for most consecutive Filmfare award for Best Actor wins. He also received a Special Recognition Filmfare Award at the 50th Filmfare Awards for being one of the first recipients of Filmfare Awards along with Lata Mangeshkar and Naushad Ali.

Kumar was appointed Sheriff of Mumbai (an honorary position) in 1980. The Government of India honoured Kumar with the Padma Bhushan in 1991, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1994 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015. The Government of Andhra Pradesh honoured Kumar with NTR National Award in 1997. He was honoured with CNN-IBN&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009. The Government of Madhya Pradesh honoured Kumar with Rashtriya Kishore Kumar Samman in 2015.

The Government of Pakistan conferred Kumar with the Nishan-e-Imtiaz, the highest civilian award in Pakistan, in 1998. The ruling political party of Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, India, had objected to this award and questioned Kumar&#x27;s patriotism. However, in 1999, in consultation with the then Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Kumar retained the award. Vajpayee declared, &quot;There is no doubt about film star Dilip Kumar&#x27;s patriotism and commitment to the nation.&quot; Kumar later said in his autobiography that returning it &quot;could have only soured relations further and produced bad vibes between India and Pakistan.&quot; Many believe this incident prolonged his wait for Bharat Ratna.

The House of Dilip Kumar in Peshawar, Pakistan, was declared a national heritage monument in 2014 by the then Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

Kumar was voted the &quot;Greatest Indian Actor of All Time&quot; in a Rediff Readers poll in 2011. He holds the Guinness World Record for having received the most awards by an Indian actor. He was honoured by the &quot;World Book of Records&quot; on his 97th birthday for his &quot;matchless contribution to Indian cinema and promoting social causes&quot;.

<text>A. Anne McLellan (born August 31, 1950) is a Canadian politician and academic who served as the ninth deputy prime minister of Canada from 2003 to 2006. She was a cabinet minister in the Liberal governments of Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin, and represented Edmonton in the House of Commons of Canada. She also held the positions of solicitor general, minister of health, and Attorney General and minister of justice of Canada.

== Early life ==
McLellan earned bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Arts and Law from Halifax&#x27;s Dalhousie University. She then earned a Master of Laws from King&#x27;s College London in the United Kingdom in 1975.

She became a professor of law, first at the University of New Brunswick and then, beginning in 1980, at the University of Alberta Faculty of Law where she served at various times as associate dean and dean. She has also served on the board of directors of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.

==Political career==
Her first foray into politics was as the Liberal candidate for the riding of Edmonton Northwest in the 1993 general election, when she won her seat by 12 votes over the first runner-up candidate. She quickly became a rising star in the Liberal Party, being one of four Liberals elected in Alberta, and was named to cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources. McLellan has the prenominal &quot;the Honourable&quot; and the postnominal &quot;PC&quot; for life by virtue of being made a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on November 4, 1993.

Ahead of the 1997 election, Edmonton Northwest was abolished in changes to the boundaries of the federal ridings. She was re-elected by narrow margins in the re-established riding of Edmonton West in 1997 and 2000, despite the Liberals&#x27; general unpopularity in Alberta. Her narrow victory in 1993 earned her the nickname &quot;Landslide Annie&quot; in Canadian political circles.

McLellan served as Attorney General and Minister of Justice from 1997 until 2002, with responsibility for implementing new anti-terror and security laws following the September 11 attacks in the United States, and the implementation of the Canadian gun registry. She served as Minister of Health from 2002 to 2003.

Though she supported Paul Martin for the Liberal leadership, Jean Chrétien retained her in his cabinet, in part because Chrétien wanted an Albertan in his cabinet for the sake of regional representation.

=== Deputy prime minister ===
On being sworn in as Prime Minister on December 12, 2003, Paul Martin named her his deputy prime minister. McLellan was also named minister for the newly created Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. As Deputy Prime Minister, she was also chair of the Cabinet Operations Committee. McLellan&#x27;s appointment was one of a number of women given senior positions in the Paul Martin government.

During the 2004 federal election, she was re-elected by 721 votes, or just over 1% of the vote, defeating Laurie Hawn of the Conservative Party of Canada in the re-formed riding of Edmonton Centre, where she ran after her Edmonton West constituency was abolished.

In the 2006 federal election, the Conservatives won government and Hawn defeated McLellan by 45.01% to 38.36%.

McLellan is one of the few Canadian parliamentarians to have spent her entire career as a cabinet member. This is due to the fact that McLellan was elected to parliament as a Liberal from Alberta, a historically weak province for the party. Serving as the only Liberal MP from the province, her inclusion as a cabinet member, and later elevation as Deputy Prime Minister, was tantamount to ensuring regional representation.

== After politics ==
On May 12, 2006, McLellan was appointed Distinguished Scholar in Residence to the University of Alberta at the Canadian university&#x27;s Institute for United States Policy Studies. On June 27, 2006, she also became counsel to the Edmonton-based law firm Bennett Jones LLP. She also became a director on the boards of Nexen Inc., Agrium Inc. and Cameco Corporation.
McClellan is currently Chair of the Board of Directors of Pearson College UWC in Victoria, B.C. Pearson is one of 18 global United World Colleges in the world.

On July 1, 2009, McLellan was appointed an officer of the Order of Canada for her service as a politician and law professor, and for her contributions as a community volunteer. On May 9, 2013, she was appointed to the Alberta Order of Excellence for her achievements in politics, law and advanced education.

In 2015, she was appointed Chancellor of Dalhousie University.

In 2016, McLellan was controversially appointed as the chair of the Task Force on Marijuana Legalization and Regulation, created to provide recommendations on the design of a new system to legalize, strictly regulate and restrict recreational use of marijuana, despite her position within Bennett Jones. The process included an opportunity for the public to provide their own input. On December 13, 2016, the panel&#x27;s report was released to the news media; its recommendations were not binding on the legislators.

On November 28, 2017, Pearson College UWC named her the chair of its board of directors.

On March 18, 2019, in the context of the SNC-Lavalin affair Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, announced that McLellan would serve as a special advisor on whether a single minister should continue to hold the positions of Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. She was also asked to analyze the operating policies and practices across the Cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the minister of justice and attorney general of Canada. She was asked to provide independent recommendations (sic) to the Prime Minister by June 30, 2019.

On October 29, 2019, following the 2019 Canadian federal election, in which the Liberal Party did not win any seats in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office announced that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had hired McLellan as an adviser. The Office said McLellan would assist the prime minister as he formed a government against the backdrop of a growing sentiment of western alienation.

On July 23, 2020 it was announced by Nova Scotia justice minister Mark Furey and federal minister of public safety and emergency preparedness Bill Blair that McLellan would serve on a 3-person Independent Review Panel concerning the RCMP response to the mass shooting that occurred in Nova Scotia on April 18/19, 2020. Families of the 22 victims killed during the shooting reacted to the announcement with disappointment, as they had been calling for a full public inquiry.

In the 2025 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, she endorsed Mark Carney.

<doc id="400314" wikidata="Q2580212" url="?curid=400314" title="List of Legion of Super-Heroes members">
<text>The Legion of Super-Heroes is a superhero team in comic book series published by DC Comics. The team has gone through various iterations. Starting with the founding trio of Cosmic Boy, Lightning Lad, and Saturn Girl, all versions of the team include teenage superheroes from several planets and alien races. In some versions, the team swells to two dozen or more members, with different sub-groupings, such as the Legion of Substitute Heroes.

==Original team (1958–1994)==

Introduced in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #247 (April 1958), the original version of the team appeared in various titles for 36 years until &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 4) #61 (September 1994).

===Founding members===
===Silver Age members===
===&quot;Bronze Age&quot; members===
===Post-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; members===

====Joined during the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot;====
Many of these individuals were only depicted in flashbacks, and information regarding their tenure is limited.

====Joined after the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot;====
===Reserve and honorary members===
===Expelled members===
===Batch SW6/New Earth team===
Introduced in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 4, #24 (December 1991), &quot;Batch SW6&quot; included teenage versions of the original Legion (whose members had all reached adulthood), which appeared in the original continuity until &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 4, #61 (September 1994). Batch SW6&#x27;s roster was equivalent to the original Legion&#x27;s membership immediately following the team&#x27;s first encounter with Universo, with Valor and Laurel Gand replacing Superboy, Mon-El and Supergirl (with all three of Triplicate Girl&#x27;s bodies intact). The members of this team were shown to be temporal duplicates of the original Legionnaires created by the Time Trapper. Additionally, five non-SW6 members joined: Computo (Danielle Foccart), Dragonmage, Catspaw, Kid Quantum, and Reep Daggle (Chameleon).

==Reboot members (1994–2004)==

The 1994 version of the Legion emerged in the aftermath of &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, and first appeared in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 4, #0 (October 1994). It was revealed in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #6 (May 2006) that this version of the team inhabits Earth-247.

===Founding members===
===Pre-draft===
===Draftees===
===Post-draft===
===Post-Blight===

The &quot;Five Years Later&quot; Legion (1989–1994, vol. 4) picks up the original Legion&#x27;s story line with &quot;The Lightning Saga&quot; story arc in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; and &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (June–August 2007). Its membership reflects the original, pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; Legion up to the events of &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 3, #63, and includes changes in Legion membership made in the &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; story arc, the &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds&quot; mini-series, and subsequent volumes of &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;.

<doc id="400318" wikidata="Q3033559" url="?curid=400318" title="Doctor of Arts">
<text>The Doctor of Arts (D.A.; occasionally D.Arts or Art.D. from the Latin &quot;artium doctor&quot;) is a discipline-based terminal doctoral degree that was originally conceived and designed to be an alternative to the traditional research-based Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and the education-based Doctor of Education (Ed.D.). Like other doctorates, the D.A. is an academic degree of the highest level. The D.A. is also frequently conferred as an honorary degree with the added designation of honoris causa.

The Carnegie Foundation was the first to fund ten universities with seed money to initiate the degree.

The D.A. differs from the Ph.D. and Ed.D. degrees in its shift in emphasis from research (though a project or thesis is generally required) to the advanced study of a specific discipline, content area expertise, learning theory, and curriculum design. As such, it is often described as a &quot;teaching doctorate&quot;. The D.A. differs from the Ed.D. in its strong disciplinary focus, while still embracing the Ed.D.&#x27;s concern for issues in education, and a theoretical as well as practical preparation in pedagogy.

== National variations ==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, the Doctor of Creative Arts degree is offered at several universities as a terminal degree in the field.

=== Europe ===
In 2016, ELIA (European League of Institute of the Arts) launched &quot;The Florence Principles on the Doctorate in the Arts&quot;. The Florence Principles, relating to the Salzburg Principles and the Salzburg Recommendations of the EUA (European University Association), define the differences between a Doctorate in the Arts compared to a scientific doctorate or Ph.D. degree. The Florence Principles have been endorsed by the European Association of Conservatoires, CILECT, the Cumulus Association, and the Society for Artistic Research.

In Finland, the Doctor of Arts degree is a research degree awarded by the University of Art and Design Helsinki, upon successful completion of studies and a dissertation in the fields of art and design.

===North America===
While the PhD is the most common doctoral degree in the United States, the U.S. Department of Education and the National Science Foundation recognize a number of research-oriented doctoral degrees such as the D.A. as &quot;equivalent&quot;, and do not discriminate between them.

The idea for a Doctor of Arts degree was originally proposed at the 1932 meeting of the Association of American Universities by Wallace Atwood, then president of Clark University. However, it was not until in 1967, with support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, that Carnegie Mellon University began to offer the D.A. in Mathematics, History, English and Fine Arts, conferring the first such Doctor of Arts degrees in the United States the following year, in 1968, to Donald H. Taranto in the field of mathematics. Guiding principles for the Doctor of Arts degree were established in 1970 by the Committee on Graduate Studies of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities and by the Council of Graduate Schools in the United States. Additional support was provided by the Carnegie Foundation in 1971.

The National Doctor of Arts Association (NDAA) was founded in 1991 at Idaho State University.

=== South America ===

In Argentina, the Doctorate of Arts is offered by the National University of Córdoba and the National University of Rosario.

<text>&quot;Down in It&quot; is the debut single by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on September 15, 1989. Taken from the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, it was the first song ever written by frontman Trent Reznor.

==Production==
The song&#x27;s outro contains lyrics referencing the nursery rhyme &quot;Rain Rain Go Away&quot;. In 2010, Reznor admitted that the song was his attempt to make a rip-off of the Skinny Puppy song &quot;Dig It&quot; from the 1986 album &quot;&quot;.

==Release==
Initially released only on vinyl, a CD version of the single was later created after the success of the album. The first track on the single edition, &quot;Down in It (Skin)&quot;, is the mix found on &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. The cover art is very similar to Joy Division&#x27;s first album &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;, with Joy Division always being cited as an influence by Reznor, and Nine Inch Nails later covered the Joy Division song &quot;Dead Souls&quot; on the soundtrack to the 1994 film &quot;The Crow&quot;.

==Promotion==
Around the time of the single&#x27;s release, the band lip-synced a performance of the song on the dance music show &quot;Dance Party USA&quot;. The footage, originally thought to be lost, was rediscovered in 2012 and went viral after being uploaded to YouTube. Reznor responded to the video on his Twitter account, stating that the band had decided to appear on the show after deciding it was &quot;the most absurd choice [they] could come up with at the time&quot; for a television program on which they would be interested in performing, but were surprised when they were actually booked to appear on the program.

===Releases===
*TVT Records TVT 2611 – 12&quot; Vinyl
*TVT Records TVT 2611-2 – CD

The single was included in the 2015 Record Store Day–Black Friday exclusive box set &quot;Halo I–IV&quot;.

==Music video==
A music video for &quot;Down in It&quot; directed by Eric Zimmerman and Benjamin Stokes, filmed on location in the Warehouse District of Chicago, was released in September 1989. It includes special effects applied to scenes such as a television set falling down forwards and backwards, writing in lights, and strobe flashing. In the video, Reznor runs to the top of a building while Chris Vrenna and Richard Patrick follow him. The original version of the music video ended with the implication that Reznor&#x27;s character had fallen off the building and died, an effect achieved by covering him in corn starch made to look like injuries. MTV edited the scene out of all airings. To film the ending of the video, Zimmerman and Stokes used a camera tied to a balloon, with ropes attached to prevent it from flying away. Minutes after they started filming, the ropes snapped and the balloons and camera flew away; after traveling over 200 miles, the contraption landed on a farmer&#x27;s field in Michigan. The farmer later handed it to the FBI, who began investigating whether the footage was a snuff film portraying a person committing suicide. The FBI identified Reznor, who later remarked, &quot;Somebody at the FBI had been watching too much Hitchcock or David Lynch or something.&quot; 

Reznor stated the following in an interview with &quot;Convulsion Magazine&quot;:There was a scene w[h]ere I was lying on the ground, appearing to be dead, in a &quot;Lodger&quot;-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it ... the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying [sic] on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere ... the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer&#x27;s field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it&#x27;s a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it&#x27;s some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, &#x27;yeah, he&#x27;s rotting,&#x27; (I had corn starch on me, right) &#x27;he&#x27;s been decomposing for 3 weeks.&#x27; You could see the other members of the band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.

The investigation ended when Reznor&#x27;s manager demonstrated that Reznor was alive and the footage was not related to crime or satanism. This story was covered by the news magazine show &quot;Hard Copy&quot; on their March 3, 1991 episode. Reznor did not enjoy the show and said, &quot;Total junk gossip exploitative journalism. That was the icing on the cake: getting on the worst TV show in America.&quot;

==Critical reception==
The single edition of the song was largely panned by AllMusic reviewer Christian Huey, who described the two remixes included as inferior to the original. Since all three tracks were later released on the &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; single, he labeled the &quot;Down in It&quot; single as &quot;completely superfluous and useful only to NIN completists&quot;.

==Covers, soundtrack appearances and legacy==
A remix of &quot;Down in It&quot; was used in an early 1990s Gatorade television advertisement. Originally, &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; by Joe Jackson was to be featured in the commercial, but Jackson declined the offer. Reznor unsuccessfully sued the production company who created the commercial for copyright infringement after he saw it in 1993, accusing them for illegal use of the song without permission.

<doc id="400325" wikidata="Q10325080" url="?curid=400325" title="Marcelo Cassaro">
<text>Marcelo Cassaro (born August 15, 1970) is a Brazilian writer of comic books, role-playing games and the science-fiction book &quot;Sword of the Galaxy&quot; (&quot;Espada da Galáxia&quot;).

==Early career==
In 1985, at age 15, Cassaro became a design assistant and in-between artist for animated cartoons in the Maurício de Sousa studios. In 1989, he was hired as an artist and screenwriter by Abril Jovem for television shows like &quot;Joe Carioca&quot;, &quot;Os Trapalhões&quot;, and &quot;Jaspion&quot;.

==Award winning writer and artist== 
In 1999, Cassaro created with artist Erica Awano the manga book &quot;Holy Avenger&quot;; it became the longest published non-child-oriented comic in Brazil. Like Japanese manga, the first three pages of each chapter were printed in color, while the remaining pages were black and white, and each issue had a two-page map showing the journey of the characters, a summary of previous events, and profiles of the main characters. But going against the standard practice of printing manga so that it read right-to-left, which conformed with Japanese reading practices, &quot;Holy Avenger&quot; was printed to be read left-to-right instead. It was the first Brazilian manga book to sell 30,000 copies each month. Forty issues were published from 1995 to 2004.

Cassara also worked as author and editor on: 
* &quot;Dungeon Crawlers&quot; 
* &quot;Victory&quot;, the first comic book with Brazilian script and art published in the United States, by Image Comics
* &quot;Lua dos Dragões&quot; (Moon of Dragons), one of the most awarded miniseries in Brazilian comics 
* &quot;The Dragon Bride&quot;, also with Erica Awano

In 1995, Cassaro started &quot;Dragão Brasil&quot;, the first Brazilian monthly magazine specialized in RPG games, and the only one to complete more than 100 editions. He left that position and worked as an author of RPGs based on licensed video games such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Final Fight&quot;, &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; and &quot;Megaman&quot;. He is also one of the authors of &quot;Tormenta&quot;, the most successful RPG in Brazil; and &quot;3D&amp;T&quot;, an RPG game based on manga and anime.

In 2009, Cassaro started writing for &quot;Turma da Mônica Jovem&quot;, the best selling comic book in South America.

==Awards==
* Together with artist Erica Awano, finalist in the First International Manga Contest (Japan, 2007), for &quot;Holy Avenger&quot;, 2018
* Ângelo Agostini Award as “Mestre do Quadrinho Nacional”, 2018

<doc id="400330" wikidata="Q2038269" url="?curid=400330" title="St Clement Danes">
<text>St Clement Danes is an Anglican church in the City of Westminster, London. It is now situated near the 19th-century Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand. Although the first church on the site was reputedly founded in the 9th century by the Danes, the current building replaced the medieval church building and was completed in 1682 by celebrated architect Sir Christopher Wren. Wren&#x27;s building was gutted by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombing raids during the Blitz and not restored until 1958, when it was adapted to its current function as the central church of the Royal Air Force.

The church might be the one featured in the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; and the bells do indeed play that tune every day at 9 am, noon, 3pm and 6pm—as reported in 1940 the church&#x27;s playing of the tune was interrupted during World War II due to Nazi bombing. However, St Clement&#x27;s Eastcheap, in the City of London, is also possibly the church from the rhyme. St Clement Danes is known as one of the two &#x27;Island Churches&#x27; in The Strand (centred in the thoroughfare), the other being St Mary-le-Strand.
==History==

===Connection to the Danes===
There are several possible theories as to the connection between the Danes and the origins of the church. A popular theory is that in the 9th century, the Danes colonized the village of Aldwych on the river between the City of London and the future site of Westminster. This was during the Danelaw and London was on the dividing line between the English and the Danes. The Danes founded a church at Aldwych, hence the final part of its name (in Latin it was known as &quot;Ecclesia Clementes Danorum&quot;). However; Aldwych is an English name and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any Danish influence. An alternative view is that after Alfred the Great had driven the Danes out of the City of London and they had been required to accept Christianity, Alfred stipulated the building of the church. In either case, being a seafaring people, the Danes named the church they built after St Clement, patron saint of mariners.

Other possible ideas are that in the 11th century after Siward, Earl of Northumbria, killed the Dane Tosti, Earl of Huntingdon, and his men, the deceased were buried in a field near London and a memorial church was subsequently built to honour the memory of the Danes. Also possible is that the Danish connection was reinforced by a massacre recorded in the Jómsvíkinga saga when a group of unarmed Danes who had gathered for a church service were killed. The 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury wrote that the Danes burnt the church on the site of St Clement Danes before they were later slain in the vicinity. Another possible explanation for the name is that, as King Harold I &quot;Harefoot&quot; is recorded as having been buried in the church in March 1040, the church acquired its name on account of Harold&#x27;s Danish connections.

===Medieval church===
The church was first rebuilt by William the Conqueror, and then again later in the Middle Ages.

A new chancel was built over part of the churchyard in 1608, at a cost of more than £1,000, and various repairs and improvements to the tower and other parts of the church cost £496 in 1618.

Shortly after the Great Fire of 1666, further repairs to the steeple were attempted, but these were found impractical, and the whole tower was rebuilt from the foundations. Work was completed in 1669. Soon afterwards it was decided that the rest of the church was in such a poor state that it too should be completely rebuilt. Wren employed Edward Pierce (with whom he worked on many churches) to create the ornate interior.

===Seventeenth-century rebuilding===

St Clement&#x27;s was rebuilt between 1680 and 1682 to a design by Sir Christopher Wren, incorporating the existing tower which was reclad. The new church was constructed from Portland stone, with an apse at the east end.
A steeple was added to the tower in 1719 by James Gibbs.

The interior has galleries on three sides supported by square pillars, continued above gallery level as Corinthian columns, supporting, in turn, a barrel-vaulted ceiling. Wren used the same scheme again at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, begun two years later. Above the galleries, each bay has a cross vault, allowing the building to be lit from large round-headed windows on the upper level.

===Later history===

William Webb Ellis, often credited with the invention of Rugby football in 1823, was once rector of the church and is commemorated by a memorial tablet.

In 1844, St. Clement Danes School was constructed on land on Houghton Road, Holborn which the churchwardens had purchased in 1552. It opened in 1862 and remained there until 1928, then moved to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush until 1975, when it was finally re-established as a comprehensive school in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire.

The church was almost destroyed by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombing raids during the Blitz on 10 May 1941. The outer walls, the tower and Gibbs&#x27;s steeple survived the raids, but the interior was gutted by fire. As a result of the blaze, the church&#x27;s ten bells fell to the ground. Subsequently, they were placed in storage and were recast after the war.

===As the Central Church of the Royal Air Force===
Following an appeal for funds by the Royal Air Force, the church was completely restored under the supervision of Sam Lloyd. In 1958, St Clement Danes Church was reconsecrated in the presence of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and his Royal Highness Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh as the Central Church of the Royal Air Force.

As part of the rebuilding, the following inscription was added under the restored Royal coat of arms:

which may be translated as: &quot;Christopher Wren built it 1672. The thunderbolts of aerial warfare destroyed it 1941. The Royal Air Force restored it 1958.&quot; [Error in the inscription: MDCLXXII should be MDCLXXXII, i.e. 1682 not 1672]

==Current worship and services==
The church is known for its excellent Anglican choral tradition of Eucharist and Matins (on Sundays, at 1100) At its roots it is Anglican and is also known for its ecumenical representation of the RAF Chaplains Branch. Services are regularly held and open to the public. Special services take place to commemorate prominent occasions of the RAF and its associated organisations. Royal Air Force Music Services provides first class musical support. The King&#x27;s Colour Squadron, formerly the Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron, attends at events and ceremonies charged with the safe-keeping of the King&#x27;s Colour for the Royal Air Force and other ceremonial duties at the RAF&#x27;s central church.

*Saint Clement is commemorated every April at St Clement Danes, a modern clementine custom/revival. The Reverend William Pennington-Bickford initiated the service in 1919 to celebrate the restoration of the famous church bells and carillon, which he&#x27;d had altered to ring out the popular nursery rhyme. This special service for children ends with the distribution of oranges and lemons to the boys and girls. Formerly William Bickford, William Pennington-Bickford (died 1941) was Rector from 1910 to 1941 and he and his wife Louisa became known for their devotion to the welfare of the parish. (He had succeeded his father-in-law in the benefice.)
*In 2008, the church was one of the venues where people gathered as part of the Armed Forces Day of Prayer. 
*In 2013 a short service was held for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The coffin was then transferred to a gun carriage drawn by the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. The cortège then continued along Fleet Street towards St Paul’s Cathedral. 
*On the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the RAF, celebrations took place at St Clement Danes.

==Community of the Cross of Nails==

The Central Church of the RAF is a member of Coventry Cathedral Community of the Cross of Nails. The three guiding principles are Healing the wounds of history, Learning to live with difference and celebrate diversity, and Building a culture of justice and peace. The Community of the Cross of Nails is guided by the words &#x27;Father Forgive&#x27;, and praying the Litany of Reconciliation. &quot;The Cross of Nails is a symbol of hope and friendship in the aftermath of conflict.&quot; Archbishop Justin Welby.

==The Friends of St Clement Danes==

==Royal Air Force features==
There are features throughout and outside the building commemorating people and units of the RAF.

===Statues===

Outside the church stand statues of two of the RAF&#x27;s wartime leaders, Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris and Hugh Dowding, both by the sculptor Faith Winter.

The erection of the statue of Harris was controversial due to his responsibility for the bombing of Dresden and other bombing campaigns against German cities. Despite protests from Germany, including from the mayors of Dresden and Hamburg as well as some in Britain, the Bomber Harris Trust (an RAF veterans&#x27; organisation) erected a statue of him outside the RAF Church of St. Clement Danes in 1992. It was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother who looked surprised when she was jeered by protesters. The line on the statue reads &quot;The Nation owes them all an immense debt&quot;. The statue had to be guarded by policemen day and night for some time as it was frequently sprayed with graffiti.

===Memorials===

The floor of the church, of Welsh slate, is inscribed with the badges of over 800 RAF commands, groups, stations, squadrons and other formations. Near the entrance door is a ring of the badges of Commonwealth air forces, surrounding the badge of the RAF.

A memorial to the Polish airmen and squadrons who fought in the defence of the United Kingdom and the liberation of Europe in the Second World War is positioned on the floor of the north aisle.

Books of Remembrance listing the names of all the RAF personnel who have died in service, as well as those American airmen based in the United Kingdom who died during the Second World War.

Near the altar are plaques listing the names of RAF, Royal Flying Corps, Royal Naval Air Service, and Commonwealth personnel awarded the Victoria Cross and the George Cross.
===Burials===
King Harold Harefoot is recorded as being buried here, although there is no memorial.

There are memorials to several people associated with the RAF whose ashes are buried in St Clement Danes, including
* Sir Archibald McIndoe, (1900–1960), plastic surgeon who worked for the RAF during World War II
* Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Tedder, (1890–1967)
* Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Douglas of Kirtleside, (1893–1969)

===Donations and artefacts===
In the gallery hang the Queen&#x27;s Colours and Standards of active RAF squadrons, (these Colours/Standards having been retired and replaced by newer versions), along with standards of several now disbanded squadrons plus the Royal Banner of the Royal Observer Corps, (most standards of disbanded squadrons hang in the rotunda of the RAF College Cranwell).

Pulpits, pews and chairs in the body of the church have been presented by various people, including past chiefs of the Air Staff, Sir Douglas Bader and the Guinea Pig Club. The armorial achievement of Lord Trenchard is displayed above the main entrance at the west end of the church. The lectern was a gift from the Royal Australian Air Force, the Cross from the Air Training Corps, the altar from the Dutch embassy. The church&#x27;s font was donated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force, and is located in the crypt. The Paschal Candle was given by the Royal Belgian Air Force. Information on the donated organ is to be found in the next section.
The Order of the Garter Banner of MRAF Lord Portal of Hungerford was transferred from St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle to St Clement Danes following his death in 1971.

==Organ==

The earliest records of an organ are from 1690, when an organ was installed by Bernard Smith. This went through several rebuildings over the next 250 years, but was finally destroyed in the Second World War. A new organ, situated facing the altar in the gallery, was installed by the builder Harrison and Harrison in 1958. This was a gift from the United States Air Force. The case was made as a replica of the Father Smith organ previously destroyed. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

===Organists===
* Anthony Young 1707–1747
* Samuel Howard 1747–1782
* Thomas Smart 1782–1803
* John Purkis 1804–1849
* Frederick Scotson Clark
* Edwin Matthew Lott 1860–1864
* Charles Edward Stephens 1864–1869
* Edmund Barnes 1869–1882
* Charles King Hall 1880–1885
* F. J. Marchment
* C. Borrow 
* D. Rayner Smith
==Schools==
The church established both a primary and a secondary school.

The St Clement Danes CE Primary School (established in 1700) is located nearby on Drury Lane in Covent Garden.

A secondary school was first located in Holborn (1862–1928) near to the church, then moved to Hammersmith as a state school run by the Inner London Education Authority as St Clement Danes Grammar School (1928–1975). It then relocated to Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, initially as a comprehensive school (1975–2011), and thereafter as an Academy as &#x27;St Clement Danes School&#x27;.

==Masonic Lodge==
In 1871 a Masonic Lodge was consecrated at the request of several local Freemasons, who wanted to meet in a local Lodge instead of having to travel out of the parish. The petition was accepted by the then Grand Master, the Earl de Grey and Ripon; accordingly the St Clement Danes Lodge was formed and granted a Warrant of Constitution, along with the registration number 1351 on the register of the United Grand Lodge of England. The first meeting of the Lodge was on 4 May 1871 at the King&#x27;s Head public house at 265 Strand, and the Rector of the Church, the Reverend R J Simpson, was the first Chaplain of the Lodge. The Lodge held meetings at various hotels and restaurants within the parish for many years, before amending its Constitution to allow it to meet at Freemasons&#x27; Hall, Great Queen Street, London, where it still meets today.

==In fiction==
The statue of Dr Samuel Johnson at the eastern end of the church land, comes to life as the character &quot;Dictionary&quot;, in Charlie Fletcher&#x27;s 2006 children&#x27;s book about unLondon, &quot;Stoneheart&quot;.

The 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; has the protagonist encountering a picture of the church from prior to the war – a building which he has known only as a ruin, never having been rebuilt. (The plot of the book, written in 1948, assumes a Third World War breaking out in the early 1950s, followed by a period of deep crisis and civil war in Britain and the rise of a totalitarian regime banning all religion; thus, no one in this future had any reason to rebuild the church).

<text>The Boston Common is a public park in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. It is the oldest city park in the United States. Boston Common consists of of land bounded by five major Boston streets: Tremont Street, Park Street, Beacon Street, Charles Street, and Boylston Street.

The Common is part of the Emerald Necklace of parks and parkways that extend from the Common south to Franklin Park in Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, and Dorchester. The visitors&#x27; center for the city of Boston is located on the Tremont Street side of the park.

The Central Burying Ground is on the Boylston Street side of Boston Common and contains the graves of artist Gilbert Stuart and composer William Billings. Also buried there are Samuel Sprague and his son Charles Sprague, one of America&#x27;s earliest poets. Samuel Sprague was a participant in the Boston Tea Party and fought in the Revolutionary War. The Common was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1977.

The Common is sometimes erroneously referred to as the &quot;Boston Commons&quot;.

==History==
=== Early history ===
William Blaxton was the first European owner of the land. He arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony as chaplain to the Robert Gorges expedition that landed in Weymouth in 1623. Every other member of this colonization attempt returned to England before the winter of 1625. Blaxton migrated five miles north to the Shawmut Peninsula, then a rocky bulge at the end of a swampy isthmus surrounded on all sides by mudflats. Blaxton lived entirely alone for five years on the peninsula that became Boston.

In 1630, Blaxton wrote a decisive letter to the Puritan group led by Isaac Johnson, whose colony of Charlestown was then failing from lack of fresh water. Blaxton advertised the excellent natural springs of the peninsula and invited Johnson&#x27;s group to settle with him on it, which they did on September 7, 1630. Johnson died less than three weeks later and Blaxton negotiated a grant of 50 acres around his home on the western edge of the peninsula from Governor John Winthrop. This amounted to approximately 10 percent of the available land on the Shawmut Peninsula and stretched from Beacon Hill to Boylston Street.

One of Johnson&#x27;s last official acts as the leader of the Charleston community was to name the new settlement across the river Boston after his original home in Lincolnshire, England. He had immigrated to Massachusetts Bay Colony with his wife Arbella and John Cotton, grandfather of Cotton Mather, during the Puritan Migration.

However, Blaxton quickly tired of his Puritan neighbors and the difficulty of retaining such a large plot of land in a town that had grown to nearly 4,000 people by 1633. This led him to sell all but six of his 50 acres back to Winthrop in 1634 for £30 ($5,455 adjusted). The governor purchased the land through a one-time tax on residents amounting to 6 shillings (around $50 adjusted) per person. Those 44 acres became the town commons of Boston and today form the bulk of Boston Common.

During the 1630s, the Common was used by many families as a cow pasture. This traditional use for a commons quickly ended when the large herds kept by affluent families led to overgrazing and the collapse of the Common as pastureland. In 1646, grazing was limited to 70 cows at a time. The Common continued to host cows until they were formally banned in 1830 by Mayor Harrison Gray Otis.

The Granary Burying Ground located at the southern edge of the Common was established in 1660. Two years later, part of this land was separated from the Common, with the southwest portion used for public buildings—including a granary and jail—and the north portion dedicated to an almshouse (probably the first in the Thirteen Colonies).

Boston Common took over from the gibbet outside the gate of Boston Neck as the town execution grounds and was used for public hangings until 1817. Most of these executions were carried out from the limb of a large oak, which was replaced with a gallows in 1769. Those executed included common criminals, military deserters, Indians, captured pirates, and religious dissidents. The most famous victims of the Common&#x27;s era as an execution grounds were the group of Quakers known almost immediately after their deaths as the Boston Martyrs. The most famous of the Boston Martyrs was executed on June 1, 1660. This was Mary Dyer, who was hanged from the oak by the Puritan government of Boston for repeatedly defying a law that banned Quakers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
The Common&#x27;s status as a civic property led to its use as a public speaking grounds, frequently used by evangelists such as George Whitefield.

On May 19, 1713, 200 citizens rioted on the Common in the Boston Bread Riot in reaction to a serious food shortage in the city. They later attacked the ships and warehouses of wealthy merchant Andrew Belcher who was exporting grain to the British West Indies for higher profits. The lieutenant governor was shot during the riot.

The Common was used as a military camp by the British before the American Revolutionary War, and it was from the Common that they set off for the Battle of Lexington and Concord.

Firework displays over Boston Common began as early as July 3, 1745 in celebration of the fall of Louisburg, followed by the celebration of the repeal of the Stamp Act on May 19, 1766 and the first anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1777 when Son of Liberty &quot;Colonel Crafts illuminated his park on the common&quot; with fireworks, according to the Pennsylvania Evening Post of July 24, 1777. True park status seems to have emerged no later than 1830, when the grazing of cows was ended and renaming the Common as Washington Park was proposed. Renaming the bordering Sentry Street to Park Place (later called Park Street) in 1804 already acknowledged the reality. By 1836, an ornamental iron fence fully enclosed the Common and its five perimeter malls or recreational promenade. Tremont Mall was an imitation of St. James&#x27;s Park in London and had been in place since 1728.

=== Park development ===
The Common was used for a variety of purposes until its formal conversion into a public park during the 1830s. These uses gradually became more urban as the city developed, shifting from pastureland to military drilling field, execution grounds, public gathering place, and finally parkland.

The park was originally &quot;out of bounds&quot; for Blacks and Indians, a restriction that was fought by the Black community in Boston until it was lifted on July 4, 1836.

The Charles Street side of Boston Common and the adjacent portions of the Public Garden were initially used as an unofficial dumping ground due to being in the lowest-lying portions of the two parks. This resulted in the portions of the two parks being &quot;a moist stew that reeked and that was a mess to walk over&quot; and driving visitors away from these areas, but the cost of repair prevented the work from being undertaken. This finally changed in the summer of 1895, when the required quantity of soil was made available as a result of the excavation of the Tremont Street subway which was used to regrade the Charles Street sides of Boston Common and the Public Garden.

=== Recent history and designation ===
A hundred people gathered on the Common in early 1965 to protest the Vietnam War. A second protest happened on October 15, 1969, this time with 100,000 people protesting in the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam.

Boston Common was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 along with the adjacent Boston Public Garden. The Common was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987 with its own listing on the National Register. It is managed by the Boston Park Department and cared for by Friends of the Public Garden, a private advocacy group which also provides additional funding for maintenance and special events.

==Notable features==

The Boston Common Frog Pond sits at the heart of the Common and is managed by the Skating Club of Boston in partnership with the City of Boston. Frog Pond is home to a winter ice skating rink and learn-to-skate school, a reflecting pool in the spring and fall, and a summer spray pool and children&#x27;s carousel.

The softball fields lie in the southwest corner of the Common. A grassy area forms the western part of the park and is most commonly used for the park&#x27;s largest events. A parking garage lies under this part of the Common. A granite slab there commemorates Pope John Paul II&#x27;s October 1, 1979 visit to Boston. The Pope said mass that day to an estimated 400,000 people.

In 1913 and 1986, prehistoric sites were discovered on the Common indicating American Indian presence long before it was colonized.

Since 1971, the Province of Nova Scotia has donated the annual Christmas Tree to the City of Boston as an enduring thank-you for the relief efforts of the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee following the Halifax Explosion of 1917.

Both the Common and Public Garden have been developed for recreational and aesthetic purposes: while the Common is primarily unstructured open space that facilitate social and political gatherings, the Public Garden providing a more manicured landscape for promenading.

<doc id="400336" wikidata="Q692386" url="?curid=400336" title="Nara Line (Kintetsu)">
<text>The is a Japanese railway line owned by the Kintetsu Railway. The line connects Fuse Station in the eastern suburbs of Osaka to Kintetsu Nara Station in the historic city of Nara, though operationally, the line begins at Ōsaka Namba Station on the Namba Line. Additionally, some trains run through-services starting at Kobe Sannomiya Station on the Hanshin Railway Main Line in Kobe. Eastern satellite cities such as Higashiosaka and Ikoma are connected by the line. This line is more direct than the JR line between Osaka and Nara.

==History==
The line was opened by in 1914, dual track and electrified at 600 VDC.

Whereas the JR West Yamatoji Line routes south of the Ikoma mountain range to connect Osaka and Nara, the Kintetsu Nara Line uses a tunnel through the Ikoma mountain range. As a result, the Kintetsu route is more direct and has allowed municipalities along the line such as Ikoma to flourish as major commuter hubs. To respond to high demand, the railway operates services with up to ten cars long during the peak hours operating as rapid and limited express services. Because of the direct routing, the Nara Line is highly regarded for being the most important commuter rail route in the Kinki region. Higher demand over the years has gradually lead to a reduction of faster midday services as Kintetsu moved to a higher frequency of limited express trains during peak hours.

In 1969 the voltage was increased to 1500 VDC, and in 1970 the Namba Line was opened, and the operational starting station of the Line moved to Kintetsu Namba Station, from Uehonmachi Station of Osaka Line.

==Operation==
Trains run to and from the Kintetsu Namba Line and the Hanshin Namba Line, and lead to Osaka Namba Station and Amagasaki Station, and Rapid Express trains also to Kobe Sannomiya Station on the Hanshin Main Line. Between Yamato-Saidaiji and Kintetsu Nara, through trains of the Kyoto Line also run.

==Kintetsu Namba Line==
 is an underground railway line owned by the Kintetsu Railway in Osaka, Japan, and opened in 1970. It is an extension of the Osaka Line and the Nara Line. The line is parallel to the Osaka Municipal Subway Sennichimae Line ( - ). Along with the commuter trains of the Nara Line and the Hanshin Namba Line, some intercity trains including the &quot;Urban Liner&quot; connecting Osaka and Nagoya, also run on the line.

<doc id="400339" wikidata="Q145897" url="?curid=400339" title="Phenol formaldehyde resin">
<text>Phenol formaldehyde resins (PF), also called phenolic resins or phenoplasts, are synthetic polymers obtained by the reaction of phenol or substituted phenol with formaldehyde. Used as the basis for Bakelite, PFs were the first commercial synthetic resins. They have been widely used for the production of molded products including billiard balls, laboratory countertops, and as coatings and adhesives. They were at one time the primary material used for the production of circuit boards but have been largely replaced with epoxy resins and fiberglass cloth, as with fire-resistant FR-4 circuit board materials.

There are two main production methods. One reacts phenol and formaldehyde directly to produce a thermosetting network polymer, while the other restricts the formaldehyde to produce a prepolymer known as novolac which can be moulded and then cured with the addition of more formaldehyde and heat. There are many variations in both production and input materials that are used to produce a wide variety of resins for special purposes.

==Formation and structure==
Phenol-formaldehyde resins, as a group, are formed by a step-growth polymerization reaction that can be either acid- or base-catalysed. Since formaldehyde exists predominantly in solution as a dynamic equilibrium of methylene glycol oligomers, the concentration of the &quot;reactive&quot; form of formaldehyde depends on temperature and pH.

Phenol reacts with formaldehyde at the ortho and para sites (sites 2, 4 and 6) allowing up to 3 units of formaldehyde to attach to the ring. The initial reaction in all cases involves the formation of a hydroxymethyl phenol:

: HOC6H5 + CH2O → HOC6H4CH2OH
The hydroxymethyl group is capable of reacting with either another free ortho or para site, or with another hydroxymethyl group. The first reaction gives a methylene bridge, and the second forms an ether bridge:

: HOC6H4CH2OH + HOC6H5 → (HOC6H4)2CH2 + H2O
: 2 HOC6H4CH2OH → (HOC6H4CH2)2O + H2O
The diphenol (HOC6H4)2CH2 (sometimes called a &quot;dimer&quot;) is called bisphenol F, which is an important monomer in the production of epoxy resins. Bisphenol-F can further link generating tri- and tetra-and higher phenol oligomers.

==Novolaks==
Novolaks (or novolacs) are phenol-formaldehyde resins with a formaldehyde to phenol molar ratio of less than one. In place of phenol itself, they are often produced from cresols (methylphenols). The polymerization is brought to completion using acid-catalysis such as sulfuric acid, oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid and rarely, sulfonic acids. The phenolic units are mainly linked by methylene and/or ether groups. The molecular weights are in the low thousands, corresponding to about 10–20 phenol units. Obtained polymer is thermoplastic and require a curing agent or hardener to form a thermoset.

Hexamethylenetetramine is a hardener added to crosslink novolac. At a temperature greater than 90 °C, it forms methylene and dimethylene amino bridges. Resoles can also be used as a curing agent (hardener) for novolac resins. In either case, the curing agent is a source of formaldehyde which provides bridges between novolac chains, eventually completely crosslinking the system.

Novolacs have multiple uses as tire tackifier, high temperature resin, binder for carbon bonded refractories, carbon brakes, photoresists and as a curing agent for epoxy resins.

==Resoles==

Base-catalysed phenol-formaldehyde resins are made with a formaldehyde to phenol ratio of greater than one (usually around 1.5). These resins are called resoles. Phenol, formaldehyde, water and catalyst are mixed in the desired amount, depending on the resin to be formed, and are then heated. The first part of the reaction, at around 70 °C, forms a thick reddish-brown tacky material, which is rich in hydroxymethyl and benzylic ether groups.

The rate of the base-catalysed reaction initially increases with pH, and reaches a maximum at about pH = 10. The reactive species is the phenoxide anion (C6H5O−) formed by deprotonation of phenol. The negative charge is delocalised over the aromatic ring, activating sites 2, 4 and 6, which then react with the formaldehyde.

Being thermosets, hydroxymethyl phenols will crosslink on heating to around 120 °C to form methylene and methyl ether bridges through the elimination of water molecules. At this point the resin is a 3-dimensional network, which is typical of polymerised phenolic resins. The high crosslinking gives this type of phenolic resin its hardness, good thermal stability, and chemical imperviousness. Resoles are referred to as &quot;one step&quot; resins as they cure without a cross linker unlike novolacs, a &quot;two step&quot; resin.

Resoles are major polymeric resin materials widely used for gluing and bonding building materials. Exterior plywood, oriented strand boards (OSB), engineered high-pressure laminate are typical applications.

==Crosslinking and the formaldehyde/phenol ratio==
When the molar ratio of formaldehyde:phenol reaches one, in theory every phenol is linked together via methylene bridges, generating one single molecule, and the system is entirely crosslinked. This is why novolacs (F:P &lt;1) do not harden without the addition of a crosslinking agents, and why resoles with the formula F:P &gt;1 will.

==Applications==
Phenolic resins are found in myriad industrial products. Phenolic laminates are made by impregnating one or more layers of a base material such as paper, fiberglass, or cotton with phenolic resin and laminating the resin-saturated base material under heat and pressure. The resin fully polymerizes (cures) during this process forming the thermoset polymer matrix. The base material choice depends on the intended application of the finished product. Paper phenolics are used in manufacturing electrical components such as punch-through boards, in household laminates, and in paper composite panels. Glass phenolics are particularly well suited for use in the high speed bearing market. Phenolic micro-balloons are used for density control. The binding agent in normal (organic) brake pads, brake shoes, and clutch discs are phenolic resin. Synthetic resin bonded paper, made from phenolic resin and paper, is used to make countertops. Another use of phenolic resins is the making of duroplast, famously used in Trabant automobiles.

Phenolic resins are also used for making exterior plywood commonly known as &quot;weather and boil proof&quot; (WBP) plywood because phenolic resins have no melting point but only a decomposing point in the temperature zone of and above.

Phenolic resin is used as a binder in loudspeaker driver suspension components which are made of cloth.

Higher end billiard balls are made from phenolic resins, as opposed to the polyesters used in less expensive sets.

Sometimes people select fibre reinforced phenolic resin parts because their coefficient of thermal expansion closely matches that of the aluminium used for other parts of a system, as in early computer systems
and Duramold.

The Dutch painting forger Han van Meegeren mixed phenol formaldehyde with his oil paints before baking the finished canvas, in order to fake the drying out of the paint over the centuries.

Atmospheric re-entry spacecraft use phenol formaldehyde resin as a key component in ablative heat shields (e.g. AVCOAT on the Apollo modules). As the heat shield skin temperature can reach 1000-2000 °C, the resin pyrolizes due to aerodynamic heating. This reaction absorbs significant thermal energy, insulating the deeper layers of the heat shield. The outgassing of pyrolisis reaction products and the removal of charred material by friction (ablation) also contribute to vehicle insulation, by mechanically carrying away the heat absorbed in those materials.

== Trade names ==

<text>The is a railway line in Japan owned by Kintetsu Railway, connecting Osaka and Mie Prefecture via Nara Prefecture. The line is the longest double-tracked railway of non-JR operators. Together with the Nagoya Line, this line forms the route for Kintetsu limited express services connecting Osaka and Nagoya in competition with the Tokaido Shinkansen.

==Services==
Along with charged Limited express, non-charged local and express services are operated on the line.
; (L)
:Mostly using 6-car trains, operations are divided at Nabari. In the west trains normally run between Osaka Uehommachi and Takayasu or Kawachi-Kokubu. During the day, 6 trains operate per hour, 5 between Osaka Uehommachi and Takayasu, and one between Osaka Uehommachi and Kawachi-Kokubu. In the east, local trains run between Nabari or Aoyamacho and Ise-Nakagawa. Some trains continues as other train types west of Nabari.
; (SSE)
:The service started on March 20, 2012. These operate using 6-car trains, between Osaka Uehommachi and Yamato-Asakura, Haibara, or Nabari, during off-peak hours.
; (SE)
:Between Osaka Uehommachi and Takayasu, Haibara or Nabari, peak hours only, replacing suburban semi-express services, using 10-, 8-, or 6-car formations.
; (Ex)
:Operated at all times except during rush hours in the peak direction, connecting Osaka Uehommachi and Aoyamachō or Isuzugawa on Toba Line, one and two services per hour respectively. These trains use short 6-car formations due to the lengths of platforms at Kawachi-Kokubu and Sambommatsu. Makes a connection to express train on Nagoya Line at Ise-Nakagawa.
; (RE)
:Long distance rapid service replacing express trains at rush hours, between Osaka Uehommachi and Aoyamachō, or Matsusaka, Ujiyamada, Isuzugawa or Toba on Toba Line in Mie Prefecture. To the west of Nabari, they operate with up to 10 cars, to the west of Aoyamachō with up to 8 cars, and 4 or 6 cars in the eastern section.
:After the schedule change on March 20, 2012, these trains were integrated with . Muroguchi-Ono and Akameguchi stations became stops of rapid express trains, but Iga-Kozu, Nishi-Aoyama, and Higashi-Aoyama stations are skipped.
:After the schedule change on March 14, 2020, morning westbound trains are shortened between Aoyamacho and Osaka Uehommachi, and trains from the Yamada Line and the Toba Line are operated as express trains until Nabari. A timetable revision scheduled for 16 March 2024 looks to mark the end of operation with 10-car trains.
:Seat reservation required for an extra charge, between Osaka Uehommachi or Osaka Namba on the Kintetsu Namba Line in Osaka and Nagoya or the Ise - Shima region.

==History==

The Osaka Electric Railway opened the Osaka Uehommachi to Fuse section as gauge dual track electrified at 600 V DC (as were all further sections unless otherwise noted) in 1914. The line was extended to Kintetsu Yao in 1924, and to Onji the following year. The Yamato-Takada to Yamato-Yagi section opened (with a single track) the same year, and was then linked to Onji and duplicated in 1927. The line was then extended to Sakurai in 1929 and the voltage on the Sakurai to Fuse section increased to 1,500 V DC to permit through-running with the Sangu Express Railway line (see below).

The Sangu Express Railway opened the Sakurai to Hase section in 1929, electrified at 1,500 V DC, and extended the line to Ise-Nakagawa the following year, single track beyond Nabari. The two companies became part of Kintetsu between 1941 and 1944.

The voltage on the Osaka Uehommachi to Fuse section was increased to 1,500 V DC in 1956, the Nabari to Iga-Kozu section was double-tracked between 1959 and 1961, and the rest of the line double-tracked between 1967 and 1975, when the 5,652 m Shin Aoyama tunnel was opened, at the time the longest tunnel built in Japan by a private railway.

===Former connecting lines===
* Sakurai Station: The Hase Railway opened a gauge line to Hase in 1909. The company merged with the Osaka Electric Railway in 1928, the year before the Sangu Express Railway opened the Sakurai to Hase line in 1929, and the line closed in 1938. The Yamato Railway operated an 1,067 mm gauge line electrified at 600 V DC to Nishi-Tawaramoto on the Kashihara Line between 1923 and 1958.
* Iga-Kambe Station: The (first) Iga Railway opened a 1,067 mm gauge line between Iga-Ueno on the Kansai Main Line and Nishi-Nabari in 1922, including a connection at this station. The line was electrified at 1,500 V DC in 1926. The section to Nishi-Nabari closed in 1964, with the Iga Line operated by the (second) Iga Railway after Kintetsu transferred operation of the line in 2007.
* Ise-Ishibashi Station: The Dainippon Railway operated a gauge line between Hisai on the Nagoya Line and Ise-Kawaguchi on the Meisho Line that connected here between 1925 and 1943.

<text>The Asiatic salamanders (family Hynobiidae) are primitive salamanders found all over Asia, and in European Russia. They are closely related to the giant salamanders (family Cryptobranchidae), with which they form the suborder Cryptobranchoidea. About half of hynobiids currently described are endemic to Japan, but their range also covers parts of China, Russia, Afghanistan and Iran.

Hynobiid salamanders practice external fertilization, or spawning. And, unlike other salamander families which reproduce internally, male hynobiids focus on egg sacs rather than females during breeding. The female lays two egg sacs at a time, each containing up to 70 eggs. Parental care is common.
A few species have very reduced lungs, or no lungs at all. Larvae can sometimes have reduced external gills if they live in cold and very oxygen-rich water.

Fossils of hynobiids are known from the Miocene to the present in Asia and Eastern Europe, though fossils of Cryptobranchoids more closely related to hynobiids than to giant salamanders extend back to the Middle Jurassic.

<text>Ancroft is a village and civil parish (which includes the village of Scremerston) in Northumberland, England. Prior to 1844, Ancroft lay within the Islandshire exclave of County Durham. It is south of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and has a population of 885, rising slightly to 895 at the 2011 census.

There are several suggestions as to how Ancroft got its name. It might be an abridged version of &quot;Aidan&#x27;s-croft&quot; - the croft of St Aidan who was the first Bishop of Lindisfarne (Holy Island). Alternatively, it might be that as the church is dedicated to Saint Anne, the village took its name from the church - &quot;St Anne&#x27;s croft&quot;. A third suggestion is simply that it means one croft or solitary croft - &quot;ane croft&quot;.

There was surely more than one croft here when the church was built, probably towards the end of the 11th century; but in common with most of this region, the community declined in the latter part of the 13th century because of the continual border raids by the Scots. This turbulent history is reflected in the number of castles and peel towers in the vicinity, besides the fortified tower that was added to the church in the thirteenth century.

Because of the repeated incursions by Scots, this northern part of what we now call Northumberland was placed in the charge of the prince-bishops of Durham. They were powerful and wealthy men who had the resources to defend the border. That is why this area was still part of County Durham until the mid 1800s.

After the accession of James I (James VI of Scotland) to the throne of England in 1603 there seems to have been a return of people to the village. But in 1667 the plague struck Ancroft, The victims were carried out into the fields where they were covered with shelters made from branches of broom. After death both bodies and shelters were burned in a rudimentary and fruitless attempt to control the spread of the disease. To this day a field to the south of the village is called &quot;Broomie Huts&quot;. In desperation the authorities of the day ordered that the plague-affected cottages should be burned to the ground. The mounds where the cottages stood, and the former village street, can still be seen in the field between the main road and the burn.

By the time of Queen Anne (1702–1714) the village was flourishing once more, with a population of over one thousand. The main industry, other than farming, was shoe and clog making. Sailors of the Royal Navy wore shoes or slippers from Ancroft. The naval specification required footwear with no metal parts - an obvious precaution to avoid sparks in a wooden ship loaded with gunpowder and tarred rope! Boots were also made for the British army - the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s troops marched to victory shod in Ancroft boots. A village tradition claims that each of the one hundred trees on the southern skyline represents a cobbler.

Several of the local settlements originated around coal mines, an industry which is being redeveloped in today&#x27;s open cast sites.

==Landmarks==
The Devil&#x27;s Causeway passes the village less than to the east. The causeway is a Roman road which starts at Port Gate on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, north of Corbridge, and extends northwards across Northumberland to the mouth of the River Tweed at Berwick-upon-Tweed.

<doc id="400347" wikidata="Q2724850" url="?curid=400347" title="Palestinian refugee camps">
<text>Palestinian refugee camps were first established to accommodate Palestinians who were displaced by the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight during the 1948 Palestine war. Camps were established by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. A subsequent wave of Palestinian refugees were created in the Naksa after the Six-Day War in 1967. 

There are 68 Palestinian refugee camps in total, 58 official and 10 unofficial, ten of which were established after the Six-Day War while the others were established in 1948 to 1950s.

Only a third of registered Palestinian refugees live within the boundaries of the refugee camps. Most have integrated socially and economically outside the camps. Many live in adjacent geographic areas. 

The number of registered Palestine refugees grew from 750,000 in 1950 to around 5 million in 2013.

==History==

===Role of UNRWA===

UNRWA&#x27;s mandate is to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees, including access to its refugee camps. For this purpose, it defines Palestinian refugees as &quot;persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.&quot;

UNRWA also extends assistance to the patrilineal descendants of such refugees, as well as their legally adopted children.

For a camp to be recognized by UNRWA, there must be an agreement between the host government and UNRWA governing use of the camp. UNRWA does not itself run any camps, has no police powers or administrative role, but simply provides services to the camp. UNRWA recognizes facilities in 58 designated refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and it also provides facilities in other areas where large numbers of registered Palestine refugees live outside of recognized camps. UNRWA also provided relief to Jewish displaced persons inside Israel following the 1948 conflict until the Israeli government took over responsibility for them in 1952. Refugee camps developed from tented cities to rows of concrete blockhouses to urban ghettos indistinguishable from their surroundings (effectively becoming urban developments within existing cities or by themselves), that house around one third of all registered Palestine refugees.

The Funding for UNRWA activities comes almost entirely from voluntary contributions from UN member states. UNRWA also receives some funding from the Regular Budget of the United Nations, which is used mostly for international staffing costs.

==List of camps==
The camps are divided between five regions:
* Gaza Strip: The Gaza Strip has eight official and no unofficial refugee camps, and 1,221,110 registered refugees.
* West Bank: The West Bank has 19 official and four unofficial refugee camps, and 741,409 registered refugees.
* Syria: Syria has nine official refugee camps and three unofficial refugee camps, and 499,189 registered refugees.
* Lebanon: There are 12 official refugee and no unofficial camps in Lebanon, and 448,599 registered refugees.
* Jordan: There are 10 official and three unofficial refugee camps in Jordan, and 2,034,641 registered refugees.

==Population statistics==
The evolution of Palestinian refugee population is shown below:

The number of Palestinian refugees living within the UNWRA registered area of operations is shown below, both those living in camps and those living outside camps:
The table below shows the population of registered refugees, other registered people, and refugees residing in camps, in 2018. UNRWA&#x27;s definition of Other Registered Persons refer to &quot;those who, at the time of original registration did not satisfy all of UNRWA&#x27;s Palestine refugee criteria, but who were determined to have suffered significant loss and/or hardship for reasons related to the 1948 conflict in Palestine; they also include persons who belong to the families of other registered persons.&quot;

<text>The is a railway line owned and operated by the Kintetsu Railway, a Japanese private railway company, connecting Nagoya and Ise Nakagawa Station in Matsusaka, Mie Prefecture via Kuwana, Yokkaichi, Suzuka, Tsu municipalities along the Ise Bay. The official starting-point of the line is Ise-Nakagawa and the terminus is Nagoya; however, operationally trains run &quot;down&quot; from and &quot;up&quot; towards Nagoya.

The line approximately parallels the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) Kansai Main Line, the Ise Railway Ise Line, and the JR Central Kisei Main Line, and all three offer rapid services from Nagoya to Ise.

At Ise-Nakagawa, the line has connections to the Osaka Line to Uehommachi and Kintetsu Namba Stations of downtown Osaka, and to the Yamada Line to Ujiyamada Station and beyond Toba Station on the Toba Line and Kashikojima Station of the Shima Line, to provide touristic access to scenic Shima Peninsula and Ise Shrine.

==History==

The first section, between Shiroko and Takadahonzan, was opened in 1915 by an independent railway operator with rail gauge . The line was extended to Tsu-shinmachi and Kusu in 1917, and to (now) Kintetsu-Yokkaichi in 1922, the line being electrified at 1500 VDC in 1926. It was extended as an electrified line to Kuwana in 1929, and to Ise-Nakagawa the following year.

In 1936 the line was acquired by the Sangu Express Railway Co., which duplicated the Kuwana - Kusu section in 1938, the year that the Kansai Express Railway Co. opened the Nagoya - Kuwana section as electrified dual track.

In 1940 the merged with the Kansai Express Railway Co., a predecessor of Kintetsu.

The Kusu - Hisai section was duplicated between 1937 and 1955, and the dual tracking of the line was completed in 1972 with duplication of the Hisai - Ise-Nakagawa section.

===Gauge conversion===
After the acquisition of a 1435mm connection to Osaka, Kintetsu passengers to that destination needed to change trains due to the difference of gauges. In 1959 the disastrous Ise-wan Typhoon destroyed the line and Kintetsu decided to convert to gauge (standard gauge) with the reconstruction, the standard of the company to enable direct operation between Osaka and Nagoya. Today a number of Limited Express trains between Osaka and Nagoya, and between Nagoya and Ise and Shima area are operated.

===Former connecting lines===
* Kuwana station - The 762mm gauge Sangi Railway Hokusei Line section to Kuwana Kyobashi operated between 1913 and 1961, being electrified in 1930 at 600 VDC, and boosted to 750 VDC in 1954.
* Edobashi station - the Ise Electric Railway 1067mm gauge line to Daijingumae opened between 1926 and 1930, and closed between 1943 and 1961.
* Tsu-shimmachi station - The Anou Railway Co. operated a 762mm gauge line to Mukumoto between 1914 and 1944. There was a branch to Katada operated from 1917 to 1927.
* Hisai station - The Dainippon Railway Co. operated a 762mm gauge line to Ise-Kawaguchi on the Meisho Line between 1925 and 1943.

===Proposed connecting line===
* Toda station - The 1972 Nagoya regional transport plan proposed a subway (Line 5) from this station to Kurokawa. In 2008 it was determined the line was not economically viable.

<text>Brandier is a hamlet in north Wiltshire, England, in Minety parish. It lies a short distance north-east of Upper Minety and is bisected by the Swindon to Kemble railway.

Brandier was the site of extensive Roman kilns and potteries which supplied the nearby regional capital of Corinium (Cirencester) with ceramic building materials. &#x27;Minety Ware&#x27; was in production until at least the medieval period and has been found as far afield as Germany. 

The hamlet once stood at a crossroads, one road of which, Crow Lane, is now a public right of way. The other, where Crossing Lane is today, roughly corresponds to the Roman road leading to Cirencester, where it connects with the Fosse Way. Until the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, the hamlet was in Gloucestershire.

The largest dwelling in the hamlet is Brandiers Farm, mostly dating from the 16th century although excavations have shown it to have been built on extensive Roman foundations, making it arguably the oldest building in the parish.

<text>The secretary of state for justice is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, with responsibility for the Ministry of Justice. The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. Since the office&#x27;s inception, the incumbent has concurrently been appointed Lord Chancellor.

The officeholder works alongside the other justice ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for justice, and the performance of the secretary of state is also scrutinised by the Justice Select Committee.

==Responsibilities==
Corresponding to what is generally known as a justice minister in many other countries, the justice secretary&#x27;s remit encompasses justice policy for the whole United Kingdom along with matters of justice specific to England and Wales.

The justice secretary is responsible throughout the UK for:
* Freedom of information and information privacy;
* Human rights and civil liberties;
* Miscarriages of justice (via the Criminal Cases Review Commission); and
* The UK’s relations with the governments of the three Crown Dependencies - Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man.

In relation to England and Wales, the justice secretary&#x27;s portfolio concerns the following matters:
* The delivery of criminal justice generally, including criminal law, criminal procedure, sentencing, probation and parole, criminal injury compensation, and victim&#x27;s rights;
* All matters falling under civil justice, including but not limited to civil procedure, administrative law, bankruptcy and insolvency law, commercial law, contract law, family law, probate, and tort; and
* Administration of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, His Majesty&#x27;s Prison and Probation Service, the Parole Board, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, the Victims&#x27; Commissioner, and the Youth Justice Board.

==Creation==
The then Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, was appointed to the post of Secretary of State for Justice when it was created in 2007. The office of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs was abolished, along with the Department for Constitutional Affairs. The home secretary, John Reid, told Parliament that future secretaries of state for justice would be MPs rather than peers.

<text>The Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department was a United Kingdom government department answerable to the Lord Chancellor with jurisdiction over England and Wales.

Created in 1885 as the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office with a small staff to assist the Lord Chancellor in his day-to-day duties, the department grew in power over the course of the 20th century, and at its peak had jurisdiction over the entire judicial system and a staff of over 22,000. In 2003, it was succeeded by the Department for Constitutional Affairs (now the Ministry of Justice).

==History==
The department was created in 1885 by Lord Selborne, who was the Lord Chancellor at the time. The Lord Chancellor was the only cabinet minister (other than those without portfolio) not to have a department of civil servants answerable to him, and justified the expenditure of creating a permanent department by saying that:

The department was originally named the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office, with the first employees simply being transferred from Selborne&#x27;s personal retinue to the new office. The need for the office was partly due to the Supreme Court of Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875, which significantly changed the structure of the courts and increased the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s workload as he struggled to enact the changes that the Acts required. Due to the odd nature of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office compared to other government departments (it was staffed almost entirely by lawyers and had an initial staff of only five) it developed slightly differently from other departments, regarding itself more as a lobbying organisation for the judges and the courts than a traditional government department.

The office was initially little more than a personal entourage for the Lord Chancellor and did little administrative work, with it being described in 1912 as &quot;not far removed from an interesting little museum&quot;. The appointment of Claud Schuster as Permanent Secretary in June 1915 changed this; he set about reforming the office to allow it to effectively run the court system. Initially with only a limited jurisdiction the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department grew in power in the 1920s, with the transfer of control of the county courts from HM Treasury to the department in 1922 and the Supreme Court (consolidation) Act 1925.

The power of the department reached its peak after the Courts Act 1971 was passed, which modernised the English court system and put the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department in direct control. Such a large increase in powers necessitated a change of office; previously the department had worked out of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s offices in the House of Lords, but it now moved to dedicated offices in Whitehall. The passing of the Supreme Court Act 1981 and a 1992 move that transferred responsibility for the magistrates&#x27; courts to the department also served to increase its responsibilities. The department ceased to exist as an independent body in 2003, when its functions were transferred to the newly created Department for Constitutional Affairs (which itself became the Ministry of Justice in 2007).

==Remit==
At the time of its merger the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department was charged with appointing and advising on the appointment of judges, running the court system and a certain number of tribunals and assisting in the reform of the English law. To this end it controlled the Public Trust Office, the Courts Service, the Official Solicitor&#x27;s Office, the Office of the Judge Advocate General, the Legal Aid Board and several more government agencies.

==Structure==
The office was run by the Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office, a senior member of the Civil Service who also served as Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. The office he ran was initially small, consisting of five individuals; the Permanent Secretary, his personal secretary, the personal secretary to the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of Presentations (who advised the Lord Chancellor on the appointment of senior members of the Church of England) and the Secretary of Commissions (who advised the Lord Chancellor on the appointment of magistrates). The department stayed small compared to other ministerial departments; in the 1960s it had a staff of only 13 trained lawyers and a few secretaries. The passing of the Courts Act 1971 and the additional duties it gave to the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department forced it to expand, and by the time it ceased to exist as an independent department it had a staff of 12,000 direct employees, 10,000 indirect employees, 1,000 buildings (more than any other government department) and a yearly budget of £2.4 billion.

==Peculiarities==
The Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department was significantly different from other government departments in a number of ways. Until 1992 it had no representative in the House of Commons; as Speaker of the House of Lords the Lord Chancellor could not sit in the House of Commons. The department was also exempt from being scrutinised by the parliamentary select committees, something which changed in 1990. The Permanent Secretary also had to be a barrister of at least seven years standing, and the Deputy Secretary always succeeded the Permanent Secretary when he retired. Both of these changed in 1990.

<text>GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc., formerly Imation Corporation, is an American holding company. Through its subsidiary, Glassbridge focuses primarily on investment and asset management.

The company was founded in 1996 under its original name of Imation as a spin-off of 3M&#x27;s data storage and imaging business. Prior to the name change, Imation had three core elements: traditional storage (magnetic tape and optical products), secure and scalable storage (data backup, data archive and data security for small and medium businesses) and what the company calls &quot;audio and video information&quot; products.

In January 2017, the company announced a change of name and direction, completing its move away from the data storage business towards being focused on asset management and strategic investment and rebranding itself as Glassbridge Enterprises.

The Imation brand was sold off later that year to O-Jin Corporation Co., a Korean company who have since licensed its use to other businesses, but retain ownership of it .

== History ==
===As Imation===
Imation was started in 1996, when 3M spun off its data storage and imaging business. The company underwent a divestment of non-core businesses, and invested in four core product technology areas: secure storage, scalable storage, wireless/connectivity, and magnetic tape. As part of 3M, the company was involved in the development of many technological improvements in data storage, such as the introduction of the first American-made magnetic tape in 1947, the first quarter-inch tape cartridge for data storage (QIC) in 1971, and the floppy disk in 1984.

In late 2007, Imation acquired TDK&#x27;s recording media business, including flash media, optical media, magnetic tape, and accessories, for $300 million. This also included a license to use the &quot;TDK Life on Record&quot; brand on data storage and audio products for 25 years. In September 2015, Imation announced that it had agreed to relinquish this license and would cease selling TDK-branded products by the end of the year.

In February 2012, Imation announced a product set to secure mobile data, identities, and workspaces, based on the idea that employees used portable storage devices to transport corporate data.

The security news followed five acquisitions the company made in 2011 in scalable storage and data security: ENCRYPTX; MXI Security from Memory Experts International; the assets of ProStor; the secure data storage hardware business of IronKey; and intellectual property from Nine Technologies. Imation received an exclusive license from IronKey for its secure storage management software and service and a license to use the IronKey brand for secure storage products.

In October 2011, Imation products for small and medium businesses centered on its DataGuard and InfiniVault multi-tier data protection and data archive appliances.

The company sold consumer electronics, headphones and accessories under the Imation, Memorex, TDK Life on Record, and XtremeMac brands. The combined Imation, Memorex and TDK Life on Record brands made the company into a global market share leader in sales of CD-R and DVD media before that business was shut down in 2016.

===Change of name and direction===
In January 2017, Imation announced its intention to change its name to Glassbridge Enterprises, completing its change of direction away from the data storage business towards being an asset management and strategic investment company. The name change became effective on February 21, 2017.

Net revenue for 2016 was $44.1 million, compared to $529.2 million the year before.
====Sale of Imation brand====
Glassbridge Enterprises sold the Imation brand name to Korean company O-Jin Corporation Co., Ltd. (now Ojin Corporation Co.) on August 4, 2017.

In 2019 Imation, by then under O-Jin&#x27;s ownership, announced licensing deals for use of the brand by PNY Technology, Ritek Corporation and photo printer company Prinics.

 O-Jin still owns the Imation brand.

<doc id="400370" wikidata="Q311958" url="?curid=400370" title="Aleksander Wolszczan">
<text>Aleksander Wolszczan (born 29 April 1946) is a Polish astronomer. He is the co-discoverer of the first confirmed extrasolar planets and pulsar planets. He is a graduate of the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń and works as a professor at the Pennsylvania State University. 

Wolszczan is a fellow of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the American Astronomical Society and the International Astronomical Union. He is also the recipient of numerous awards for his groundbreaking contributions in the field of astronomy including Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science, Beatrice M. Tinsley Prize and the Marian Smoluchowski Medal of the Polish Physical Society.

== Early life and education ==

Wolszczan was born on 29 April 1946 in Szczecinek located in present-day West Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland; in the 1950s his family moved to Szczecin. His father Jerzy Wolszczan taught economics at former Szczecin Polytechnic (currently West Pomeranian University of Technology) and his mother, Zofia, worked for the Polish Writers&#x27; Union. His early interest in astronomy was inspired by his father who told him stories and myths connected with stellar constellations. As a seven-year-old he already learned the basics of astronomy. He observed the night sky using a small telescope he constructed himself. He graduated from Stefan Czarniecki VI High School in Szczecin.

== Scientific career ==
Wolszczan sat for an M.Sc. in 1969 and a Ph.D. in 1975 at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland. Between 1969 and 1973 he worked at the Department of Radioastronomy of the Institute of Astronomy. In 1973, as a senior assistant, he moved to Bonn for training at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. From 1979 to 1982 he worked at the Astronomical Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Toruń, and in 1982 he moved to the United States to work at Cornell University and Princeton. Later he became an astronomy professor at Pennsylvania State University. From 1994 to 2008, he was also professor at the Nicolaus Copernicus University. He is a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Working with Dale Frail, Wolszczan carried out astronomical observations from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico that led them to the discovery of the pulsar PSR B1257+12 in 1990. On 9 January 1992 they discovered that the pulsar was orbited by two planets, whose masses were initially assessed at 3.4 and 2.8 times Earth&#x27;s mass. The radii of their orbits are 0.36 and 0.47 AU respectively. This was the first confirmed discovery of planets outside the Solar System (as of 2 June 2021, 4,401 such planets were known). Wolszczan announced his findings in 1992 during the Meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Atlanta. Two years later he published the results of his discovery and was chosen by the journal &quot;Nature&quot; as the author of one of 15 fundamental discoveries in the field of physics. Despite some initial misgivings by several experts, today his discovery is regarded as fully substantiated. Astronomer Bohdan Paczyński called it &quot;the greatest discovery by a Polish astronomer since Copernicus.&quot; In 1998, &quot;Astronomy&quot; magazine included his discovery among The 25 Greatest Astronomical Findings of All Time. At the Arecibo Observatory, Wolszczan also collaborated with Joseph H. Taylor Jr and conducted research on millisecond pulsars.

In 2003 Maciej Konacki and Wolszczan determined the orbital inclinations of the two pulsar planets, showing that the actual masses were approximately 3.9 and 4.3 Earth masses respectively.

In 2007, Wolszczan was also part of a Polish team of astronomers led by Andrzej Niedzielski that found yet another planet outside the Solar System, HD 17092 b, orbiting star HD 17092.

In 2012, Matthew Route and Wolszczan detected bursts of radio waves emitted from 2MASS J10475385+2124234 using Arecibo Observatory. This T6.5 brown dwarf has a temperature of 800-900 K, making it the coolest known radio-emitting substellar object. Its magnetic field is stronger than 1.7 kG. In 2016, the team discovered the most rapidly rotating brown dwarf, the T6 WISEPC J112254.73+255021.5. Its rotation period may be as little as 17 minutes. In 2017, he was awarded the Bohdan Paczyński Medal conferred by the Polish Astronomical Society.

Wolszczan is a member of many scientific associations which include: the Polish Academy of Sciences, American Astronomical Society, American Association for the Advancement of Sciences, International Union of Radio Science, International Astronomical Union, and Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America.

== Recognition ==

At Pennsylvania State University, Wolszczan held the Evan Pugh Professorship of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Upon retirement in 2024, he was awarded the title of Atherton Professor.

In 1992 Wolszczan won the Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science. In 1996, he was awarded the Beatrice M. Tinsley Prize by the American Astronomical Society, and in 1997 Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski presented him with the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for outstanding contributions to Polish science. In 2002, he appeared on a Polish postage stamp (as part of a series of 16 stamps, titled &quot;Polish Millennium,&quot; which summarizes the last 1,000 years of history, culture, and science in Poland).

In 2006, Wolszczan officially became an honorary citizen of Szczecin. In 2007, Jan Sosiński directed a documentary film on the life and scientific work of Wolszczan entitled &quot;Gwiazdor - Aleksander Wolszczan&quot;.

He was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020.

== Controversy ==
In 2008 &quot;Gazeta Prawna&quot; disclosed that from 1973 until 1981 Wolszczan was an informant (codenamed &quot;Lange&quot;) for the Polish communist-era Służba Bezpieczeństwa. He confirmed this, but stressed that he was passing only unimportant information, usually publicly known, and that he did not harm anybody. The resulting controversy in Polish media resulted in his resignation from Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.

<text>The bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis) is a species of fox found on the African savanna. It is the only extant species of the genus &quot;Otocyon&quot; and a basal species of canid. Fossil records indicate this canid first appeared during the middle Pleistocene. There are two separate populations of the bat-eared fox, each of which makes up a subspecies. The bat referred to in its colloquial name is possibly the Egyptian slit-faced bat (&quot;Nycteris thebaica&quot;), which is abundant in the region and has very large ears. Other vernacular names include big-eared fox, black-eared fox, long-eared fox, Delalande&#x27;s fox, cape fox, and motlosi.

It is named for its large ears, which have a role in thermoregulation. It is a small canid, being of comparable size to the closely related cape fox and common raccoon dog. Its fur varies in color depending on the subspecies, but is generally tan-colored and has guard hairs of a grey agouti color. The bat-eared fox is found in Southern and East Africa, though the two subspecies are separated by an unpopulated region spanning approximately . In its range, the bat-eared fox digs dens for shelter and to raise its young, and lives in social groups or pairs that hunt and groom together.

The bat-eared fox eats mainly insects—a diet unique among canids. It forages in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring regions with bare ground and where ungulates keep grasses short, and locates prey by using its hearing, walking slowly with its nose to the ground and ears tilted forwards. Most of its diet is made up of harvester termites, which also hydrates the bat-eared fox, as it does not drink from free-standing water. By feeding on harvester termites, it acts as a means of population control for these insects, which are considered pests in regions populated by humans. In such regions, it has been hunted for its fur. No major threats to the bat-eared fox exist, and as such it is considered to be a least-concern species.

==Etymology==
The bat-eared fox&#x27;s generic name &quot;Otocyon&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;otus&quot; () for ear and &quot;cyon&quot; () for dog, while the specific name &quot;megalotis&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;megas&quot; () for large and &quot;otus&quot; () for ear. The common name for the bat-eared fox is likely taken from the Egyptian slit-faced bat (&quot;Nycteris thebaica&quot;), due to the bat&#x27;s similarly large ears and abundance in the bat-eared fox&#x27;s geographic range. Other vernacular (common) names for the bat-eared fox include big-eared fox, black-eared fox, long-eared fox, Delalande&#x27;s fox, cape fox, and motlosi.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The bat-eared fox is the only living species of the genus &quot;Otocyon&quot;. Its scientific name, given by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest, was initially &quot;Canis megalotis&quot; (due to its close resemblance to jackals), and later changed by Salomon Müller which placed it in its own genus, &quot;Otocyon&quot;; its large ears and different dental formula warrant inclusion in a genus distinct from both &quot;Canis&quot; and true foxes (&quot;Vulpes&quot;).

Due to its unusual dentition—, the largest number of teeth known in any non-marsupial land mammal—the bat-eared fox was previously placed in a distinct subfamily of canids, Otocyoninae, as no relationship to any living species of canid could be established.

=== Phylogeny ===
&quot;Otocyon megalotis&quot; is regarded as having affinities with the vulpine line, and &quot;Otocyon&quot; was placed with high confidence as sister to the clade containing both the raccoon dog (&quot;Nyctereutes&quot;) and true foxes (&quot;Vulpes&quot;), occupying a basal (closest to the base) position within Canidae.

The following cladogram is based on figures by Lindblad-Toh et al., 2005:
==== Subspecies ====
Currently, there are two recognized subspecies:

==== Fossils ====
&quot;Otocyon&quot; is poorly represented in the fossil record. It is suggested the genus forms a clade with &quot;Prototocyon&quot;, an extinct genus of canid. In the Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, fossils of the related extinct fox species first considered &quot;Otocyon recki&quot; have been found that date back to the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene. &quot;O. recki&quot; is now often placed in &quot;Prototocyon&quot;; fossil records specifically of &quot;Otocyon megalotis&quot; have been identified in sediments only as old as the middle Pleistocene. These fossils, known from the Lainyamok locality of Kenya, date back .

== Characteristics ==

Bat-eared foxes range in weight from . Their head and body length is , tail length is , shoulder height is , and the notably large ears are long. The species displays a degree of sexual dimorphism, in that females are generally larger and heavier than males.

Generally, the pelage is tan-colored, with gray guard hairs of an agouti coloration. The undersides and throat are pale. The limbs are dark, shading to dark brown or black at their extremities. The muzzle, the tip and upperside of the tail and the facial mask are black. The insides of the ears are white. Individuals of the East African subspecies, &quot;O. m. virgatus&quot;, tend toward a buff pelage with dark brown markings, as opposed to the black of &quot;O. m. megalotis&quot;. The proportionally large ears of bat-eared foxes, a characteristic shared by many other inhabitants of hot, arid climates, such as the desert cottontail, help to distribute heat. They also help in locating prey.

===Dentition and jaw adaptations===
The teeth of the bat-eared fox are much smaller those of other canid species, excepting the bush dog (&quot;Spetothos venaticus&quot;) and dhole (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;). The molars are much more blunted and the roots are stronger than those of other canids, and the teeth have less shearing capability. These are adaptations to its insectivorous diet and avoidance of soft foods. The bat-eared fox possesses 4-5 lower molar teeth and 3-4 upper molars, a number notable as it is greater than the number of lower or upper molars possessed by any other extant eutherian or canid, respectively.

The teeth are not the bat-eared fox&#x27;s only morphological adaptation for its diet. On the lower jaw, a step-like protrusion is present called the subangular process, which is present in only a few canid species and both increases the bite force of the masseter muscle and anchors the large digastric muscle to allow for rapid chewing. The digastric muscle is also modified to allow for opening and closing the jaw five times per second.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The bat-eared fox has a disjunct distribution across the arid and semi-arid regions of Eastern and Southern Africa, in two allopatric populations (representing each of the recognized subspecies) separated by approximately . Subspecies &quot;O. m. virgatus&quot; extends from southern Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia, through Uganda and Kenya to southwestern Tanzania; &quot;O. m. megalotis&quot; occurs in the southern part of Africa, ranging from Angola through Namibia and Botswana to South Africa, and extends as far east as Mozambique and Zimbabwe, spreading into the Cape Peninsula and toward Cape Agulhas. Home ranges vary in size from . The two disjunct ranges of &quot;O. megalotis&quot; were likely connected to each other during the Pleistocene epoch.

Bat-eared foxes are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are commonly found in short grasslands, as well as the more arid regions of the savannas, along woodland edges, and in open acacia woodlands. They prefer bare ground and areas where grass is kept short by grazing ungulates and tend to hunt in these short grass and low shrub habitats. However, they do venture into areas with tall grasses and thick shrubs to hide when threatened.

In addition to raising their young in dens, bat-eared foxes use self-dug dens for shelter from extreme temperatures and winds. They also lie under acacia trees in South Africa to seek shade during the day.

== Behavior and ecology ==

Bat-eared foxes are social animals. They live in pairs or groups, depending on the subspecies. In southern Africa (ssp. &quot;megalotis&quot;), bat-eared foxes live in monogamous pairs with pups, while those in eastern Africa (ssp. &quot;virgatus&quot;) may live in pairs, or in stable family groups consisting of a male and up to three closely related females with pups. Individuals forage, play, and rest together in a group, which helps in protection against predators. They engage in frequent and extended allogrooming sessions, which serve to strengthen group cohesion, mostly between mature adults, but also between young adults and mature adults.

Visual displays are important in communication among bat-eared foxes. When they are looking intently at something, the head is held high, eyes are open, ears are erect and facing forward, and the mouth is closed. When an individual is in threat or showing submission, the ears are pulled back and lying against the head and the head is low. The tail also plays a role in communication. When an individual is asserting dominance or aggression, feeling threatened, playing, or being sexually aroused, the tail is arched in an inverted U shape. Individuals can also use piloerection, which occurs when individual hairs are standing straight, to make it appear larger when faced with extreme threat. When running, chasing, or fleeing, the tail is straight and horizontal. The bat-eared fox can recognize individuals up to away. The recognition process has three steps: First they ignore the individual, then they stare intently, and finally they either approach or attack without displays. When greeting another, the approaching individual shows symbolic submission which is received by the other individual with a high head and tail down. Few vocalizations are used for communication, but contact calls and warning calls are used, mostly during the winter. Glandular secretions and scratching, other than for digging, are absent in communication, although they appear to establish pair bonds by scent marking.

In the more northern areas of its range (around Serengeti), they are nocturnal 85% of the time. However, around South Africa, they are nocturnal only in the summer and diurnal during the winter.

=== Hunting and diet ===
The bat-eared fox is the only truly insectivorous canid, with a marked preference for harvester termites (&quot;Hodotermes mossambicus&quot;), which can constitute 80–90% of its diet.

When this particular species of termite is not available, their opportunistic diet allows a wide variety of food items to be taken: they can consume other species of termites, other arthropods such as ants, beetles (especially scarab beetles), crickets, grasshoppers, millipedes, moths, scorpions, spiders, and rarely birds, birds&#x27; eggs and chicks, small mammals, reptiles, and fungi (the desert truffle &quot;Kalaharituber pfeilii&quot;). Berries, seeds, and wild fruit also are consumed. The bat-eared fox refuses to feed on snouted harvester termites, likely because it is not adapted to tolerate the termites&#x27; chemical defense.

Bat-eared foxes require water for lactation, but have not been observed drinking from free-standing water. They meet their water requirements through the high water content of their diet.

Bat-eared foxes usually hunt in groups, often splitting up in pairs, with separated subgroups moving through the same general area. When termites are plentiful, feeding aggregations of up to 15 individuals from different families occur. Individuals forage alone after family groups break in June or July and during the months after pups birth.

Prey is located primarily by auditory means, rather than by smell or sight. Foraging patterns vary between seasons and populations, and coincide with termite availability. In eastern Africa, nocturnal foraging is the rule, while in southern Africa, nocturnal foraging during summer slowly changes to an almost solely diurnal pattern during the winter. Foraging techniques depend on prey type, but food is often located by walking slowly, nose close to the ground and ears tilted forward. It usually occurs in patches, which match the clumped prey resources, such as termite colonies, that also occur in patches. Groups are able to forage on clumps of prey in patches because they do not fight each other for food due to their degree of sociality and lack of territoriality. As the bat-eared fox&#x27;s range overlaps with that of the aardvark, it will take advantage of termite mounds opened up by the latter animal, as will aardwolves.

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===

The bat-eared fox is predominantly socially monogamous, although it has been observed in polygynous groups. In contrast to other canids, the bat-eared fox has a reversal in parental roles, with the male taking on the majority of the parental care behavior. Gestation lasts for 60–70 days and females give birth to litters consisting of one to six pups. Beyond lactation, which lasts 14 to 15 weeks, males take over grooming, defending, huddling, chaperoning, and carrying the young between den sites. Additionally, male care and den attendance rates have been shown to have a direct correlation with pup survival rates. The female forages for food, which she uses to maintain milk production, on which the pups heavily depend. Food foraged by the female is not brought back to the pups or regurgitated to feed the pups.

Pups in the Kalahari region are born September–November and those in the Botswana region are born October–December. Young bat-eared foxes disperse and leave their family groups at 5–6 months old and reach sexual maturity at 8–9 months. Bat-eared foxes have been recorded reaching maximum lifespans of over 14 to 17 years in captivity, and up to 9 years in the wild.

== Threats and human interaction ==
No major threats to bat-eared fox populations exist, though hunting, disease and drought can threaten individuals and lower population numbers on a short term scale. Diseases that affect the bat-eared fox include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, and rabies. Predators to the bat-eared fox are mostly large mammalian carnivores, but they are also prey to large raptors and the Central African rock python. Black-backed jackals pose the greatest threat to young bat-eared foxes, but in breeding areas, adults will engage in mobbing behavior to drive them off.

=== Conservation ===
&quot;Otocyon megalotis&quot; is considered to be a least-concern species by both the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the South African National Biodiversity Institute. Some parts of its range are incidentally protected areas.

=== Human use and captivity ===
The bat-eared fox has some commercial use for humans. They are important for harvester termite population control, as the termites are considered pests. They have also been hunted for their fur by Botswana natives. Captive bat-eared foxes are present in zoos in North America, South Africa, Europe, and Asia.

<doc id="400384" wikidata="Q2020203" url="?curid=400384" title="Rhyl">
<text>Rhyl (; , ) is a seaside town and community in Denbighshire in Wales. The town lies on the coast of North Wales, at the mouth of the River Clwyd. 

To the west is Kinmel Bay and Towyn, to the east Prestatyn, and to the south-east Rhuddlan and St Asaph. At the 2011 Census, Rhyl had a population of 25,149, with Rhyl–Kinmel Bay having 31,229. Rhyl forms a conurbation with Prestatyn and its two outlying villages, the Rhyl/Prestatyn Built-up area, whose 2011 population of 46,267 makes it North Wales&#x27;s most populous non-city. Rhyl was once an elegant Victorian resort town, but suffered rapid decline around the 1990s and 2000s; attempts have been made to reverse this through county investment, equal to around £15 million from Denbighshire County, however, the outcomes have been perceived with varying levels of success. 

Prior to being in Denbighshire since 1996, it was in the Clwyd district of Rhuddlan, and before that the historic county of Flintshire.

==Etymology==
Early documents refer to a dwelling in the area named &quot;Ty&#x27;n Rhyl&quot; (&quot;Rhyl croft&quot;), and a manor house with that name still exists in the oldest part of the town. Its Welsh orthography has proved difficult for English writers to transliterate as &quot;Rhyl&quot;&#x27;s opening voiceless alveolar trill is uncommon in the English language (represented in modern Welsh by the digraph &#x27;Rh&#x27;). As such the name has appeared in English texts as &quot;Hulle&quot; (1292), &quot;Hul&quot; (1296), &quot;Ryhull&quot; (1301), &quot;Hyll&quot; (1506), &quot;Hull&quot; (1508), &quot;yr Hyll&quot; (1597), &quot;Rhil&quot; (1706), &quot;Rhûl&quot; (1749), &quot;Rhul&quot; (1773), &quot;Rhyll&quot; (1830) and &quot;Rhyl&quot; (1840).

The etymonic origin of the word &quot;Rhyl&quot; has been the subject of debate for more than a century. It has been suggested that it derives from a contraction of &quot;Yr Heol&quot; (&quot;The Road&quot;). However, this derivation is problematic as it is thought that no road of significance passed through the area before the name was already extant. Another suggested etymology is that the name is a hybrid of the unfamiliar English word &quot;hill&quot; and the Welsh definite article &quot;yr&quot; (&quot;Yr Hill&quot;, becoming &quot;Y Rhyl&quot;, and then just &quot;Rhyl&quot; in English). Although this is problematic as Rhyl is situated in a very flat area with no hills, it has been suggested that the original &#x27;hill&#x27; was a piece of dry land relatively raised above the surrounding marshes (cors y rhyl). Another suggestion is that it could have referred to a now-forgotten man-made structure, such as a motte outpost of Rhuddlan Castle guarding the mouth of the River Clwyd. 

One etymology that gained popularity in the twentieth century suggests that the original dwelling of &quot;Ty&#x27;n Rhyl&quot; derived from &quot;Tŷ&#x27;n yr haul&quot; (House in the Sun/House of Sunshine). This may be an example of folk etymology, as Rhyl gained popularity as a summer destination for Welsh-speaking tourists and was advertised in English and Welsh as &quot;Sunny Rhyl&quot;.

==Buildings, landmarks and attractions==
Rhyl has a number of Grade II listed buildings and landmarks. These include the Parish Church of St Thomas in Bath Street, which is listed as Grade II*. Others are the Midland Bank building, the railway station along with two signal boxes and the public telephone box on the up platform, the Royal Alexandra Hospital, the Sussex Street Baptist Church, Rhyl Town Hall, the &quot;Swan&quot; public house in Russell Road, the war memorial, and the Welsh Presbyterian Church in Clwyd Street.
Also notable is the Grade II listed Foryd Harbour Bridge, a blue bridge with distinctive bowstring girders built in 1932. Situated over the River Clwyd, it links Rhyl with Kinmel Bay.

Another landmark is the Church of St Margaret of Antioch. The Marble Church was built by Lady Margaret in memory of her late husband, Sir Henry Peyto Willoughby de Broke. It was completed within four years and consecrated on 23 August 1860, becoming the parish church of a new parish of Bodelwyddan, covering an area formerly in that of St Asaph. The church opens daily from 9:30 to 16:30, except between 25 December and 6 January.

A previous Rhyl landmark was the ornate Pavilion Theatre with five domes, which was demolished in 1974. Half a mile further down the promenade stood Rhyl Pier, opened in 1867 at long. The structure was damaged by ships in 1883 and again in 1891. It was further damaged in 1901 by fire. Storms were responsible for further damage in 1909 in 1913 was closed as unsafe. Although it reopened with a much-reduced length in 1930, it closed again in 1966 and was demolished in 1973.

Rhyl&#x27;s top attractions on the West Parade are Rhyl Children&#x27;s Village theme park, and the Sky Tower (formerly the Clydesdale Bank tower, brought to Rhyl from the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival). The Sky Tower opened in 1989, but it was closed to the public in 2010 and transformed into an illuminated beacon in 2017. A VUE Cinema that closed in January 2025 is also located there.

On the East Parade is the SeaQuarium. Up until 2014, Rhyl Suncentre was also an attraction on the East Parade; an indoor water leisure centre which opened in 1980 at a cost of £4.25 million and featured a heated swimming pool, water chutes and slides, and Europe&#x27;s first indoor surfing pool. The local council closed the centre in early 2014 and it was demolished in 2016. A new Travelodge hotel was built next to the site, which opened in early 2019. A new indoor/outdoor water park, the SC2, opened further along the promenade in 2019, and includes various pools with water chutes and slides, as well as a separate &quot;Ninja Tag&quot; assault course game complex. Also on the East Parade is the New Pavilion Theatre, opened in 1991. It has over 1,000 seats and is managed by Denbighshire County Council. Redevelopment of the Pavilion theatre in 2017 provided for a new façade, entrance foyer and restaurant, and refurbished bar areas.

===Marine Lake===
The Marine Lake, an artificial excavation in the west of the town, used to be a tourist destination, with fairground rides and a zoo. The lake is a 12-hectare human-made reservoir and it was officially opened in 1895. Rhyl Miniature Railway is the only original attraction remaining on the site, a narrow gauge railway that travels around the lake and is now based at the new museum and railway centre. There is also a playground and numerous watersports clubs based around the lake.

The Marine Lake Funfair was demolished in the late 1960s, having been replaced by the nearby Ocean Beach Funfair. Ocean Beach finally closed on 2 September 2007 and was demolished to make way for a planned new development initially called Ocean Plaza. This was to include apartments, a hotel and various retail outlets. However, work on Ocean Plaza never went ahead as scheduled and the land lay vacant for several years after the original developers, Modus Properties, went bankrupt in 2009. The site was sold to a new company, Scarborough Development Group (SDG), in 2010, but again no work commenced on the site for several years. In 2014, SDG submitted revised plans to develop the land on a much smaller scale than the original plans. Now called Marina Quay, the plans no longer include the building of new apartments on the land as Natural Resources Wales&#x27; flood regulations now prohibit this. The plans were approved by the local authority in November 2014. In August 2015, The Range retail chain signed a 20-year lease and opened a new outlet on the site in March 2018. Aldi also opened a branch on the site in 2019.

==Governance==

For elections to Denbighshire County Council, Rhyl is divided into six electoral wards: Rhyl East, Rhyl South, Rhyl South West, Rhyl Trellewelyn, Rhyl Ty Newydd, and Rhyl West. After the 2022 local elections, eleven of Rhyl&#x27;s county councillors belonged to the Welsh Labour Party and one to the Welsh Conservatives. In 2008 Rhyl West appeared as the most deprived ward in Wales in the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation.

The 22 councillors on Rhyl Town Council are divided among nine community wards: Bodfor, Brynhedydd, Cefndy, Derwen, Foryd, Pendyffryn, Plastirion, Trellewellyn, and Tynewydd.

<text>The state prison system in Alaska, comprising both pre-trial booking and long-term incarceration for sentenced prisoners, is a unified system run by the Alaska Department of Corrections. Prior to the establishment of the department during the early 1980s, corrections was a division of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. That department still operates juvenile correctional facilities through its Division of Juvenile Justice.

There are no federal prisons located in the state of Alaska. Federal prisoners awaiting trial or sentencing are typically held in state facilities. Prisoners who have been sentenced are usually sent to FCI Sheridan, located in Sheridan, Oregon, to serve their sentences.

== Facilities ==

* Anchorage Correctional Complex, Anchorage (working capacity 850), including: 
** Anchorage Correctional Complex East, formerly known as Anchorage Jail

<text>Cairo Governorate () is one of the 27 governorates of Egypt. It is formed of the city of Cairo, both the national capital of Egypt and the governorate&#x27;s, in addition to five satellite cities: the New Administrative Capital - set to become the seat of national government, New Cairo, Shourok, Badr, Capital Gardens, and 15th of May. These cities form almost half of the Greater Cairo metropolitan area by population.

Cairo is one of three city-states in Egypt, and the governor of Cairo is also the head of the city. Nonetheless, the governate of Cairo and the city of Cairo are two semi-distinct levels of local government, and as with other governorates, the governor is appointed by the president.

==Overview==
Parts of the governorate - the Helwan district and the satellite cities, were spun off in April 2008 to form the Helwan Governorate, only to be reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate in April 2011.

==Municipal divisions==
The governorate is divided into the city of Cairo, and the unallocated desert hinter land (). 
Cairo city is subdivided into four Areas () headed by a deputy governor each, and 38 Districts (, sing. ) with their own governor appointed heads. Some districts are represented by one police station (, plr. ), while others may be subdivided by two or more.

The Northern Area divided into 8 Districts:

Shubra, Al-Zawiya al-Hamra, Hadayek al-Kobba, Rod al-Farg, al-Sharabiya, al-Sahel, al-Zaytoun, and Al-Amiriya

The Eastern Area divided into 9 Districts:

Misr al-Gadidah (Heliopolis), Al-Nozha, Nasr City East (Sharq Madinet Nasr), Nasr City West (Gharb Madinet Nasr), al-Salam Awwal, al-Salam Thani, al-Matariya, and al-Marg.

The Western Area divided into 9 Districts:

Manshiyat Nasser, Al-Wayli, Wasat al-Qahira (: Al-Darb al-Ahmar, al-Gamaliyya, al-Hussein), Boulaq, Gharb El-Qahira (Zamalek, Garden City, Down Town), Abdeen, Al-Azbakiya, al-Muski, and Bab El-Shaaria.

The Southern Area divided into 12 Districts:

Masr El-Qadima (Old Cairo), al-Khalifa, al-Moqattam, al-Basatin, Dar El-Salam, El-Sayeda Zeinab, al-Tebin, Helwan, al-Ma&#x27;sara, al-Maadi, Tora, and 15th may City.

In addition to Cairo City, there are five satellite cities that are under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities who chairs the New Urban Communities Authority that directly controls them (planning, land sales, zoning), while the governorate departments () control police and select public services (education, health, subsidised food). The more populated ones are subdivided into , while the ones still under construction are yet to have governorate representation. These cities are:

New Cairo ( 1,2,3)

Badr ()

15th of May ()

New Administrative Capital (Under construction) 

Capital Gardens (Under construction)

As of January 2023, the municipal divisions had a total estimated population as of 10,203,693.

<text>The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (DRC or ODRC) is the administrative department of the Ohio state government responsible for oversight of Ohio State Correctional Facilities, along with its Incarcerated Individuals. Ohio&#x27;s prison system is the sixth-largest in America, with 27 state prisons and three facilities for juveniles. In December 2018, the number of inmates in Ohio totaled 49,255, with the prison system spending nearly $1.8 billion that year. ODRC headquarters are located in Columbus.

==History==
On April 11, 1993, a major riot broke out at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility that resulted in ten deaths. Nine inmates and one corrections officer were killed.

In 2019, the &quot;Cleveland Plain-Dealer&quot; reported that the department&#x27;s inspection office had a single full-time employee, and used interns to conduct inspections.

==Facilities==
===Juvenile Facilities===

The Following Juvenile Correctional Facilities are operated by the Ohio Department of Youth Services.

* Circleville 
* Cuyahoga Hills
* Indian River

<text>The Davenport Locomotive Works, of Davenport, Iowa, USA, was formed as the W W Whitehead Company in 1901. In 1902, the company commenced building light locomotives. The Company was renamed the Davenport Locomotive Works in 1904.

In late 1930, Davenport was licensed to assemble and market R G LeTourneau Inc products under the Davenport-LeTourneau brand. The agreement is believed to have ended in 1935 when LeTourneau moved to Peoria, Illinois. Davenport also sold Davenport-Winchell three-wheel roller conversions of industrial wheel tractors, Davenport-Frink snow plows, which were built in license from Frink Sno-Plows Inc, and Reynolds patented Mov-Mor rotary scrapers.

In 1933, the company was again restructured and renamed the Davenport-Besler Corporation, which continued in business until 1956. William George Besler was a director at the time of the restructuring. The company acquired the locomotive business of H. K. Porter, Inc. in 1950 and from then on produced Porter designs as well as its own. The Canadian Locomotive Company acquired Davenport-Besler in 1955, closing it the following year.

The company had built small steam locomotives early on; its first gasoline-fueled internal combustion engined locomotive was built in 1924 and its first diesel locomotive in 1927, a diesel-electric for the Northern Illinois Coal Company of Boonville, Indiana.

An extensive range of diesel locomotives in all industrial sizes followed, utilizing either mechanical torque converter or electric transmission, the former for the smaller locomotives. Most were used by a variety of industrial customers, but some railroads also bought Davenport locomotives, particularly the size: being the largest locomotive then allowed by union rules to be operated by one person. Railroad buyers included the Rock Island, Milwaukee Road, Santa Fe, Frisco, and Missouri Pacific. In 1963, that rule was relaxed and railroads ceased buying industrial-sized locomotives for light switching.

Davenport built a number of locomotives for the United States Army including World War I trench railways, the USATC S100 Class 0-6-0 of World War II, and eighteen larger switcher locomotives during the 1950s, two of which were adjustable in gauge: One could operate on broad gauges up to , and one on narrow gauges—the latter () operating for a period on the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad.

Three Davenport 500 HP locomotives (built in 1952) of the State Railway of Thailand are still in service as of March 2023.

Various Davenport locomotives are preserved in the US as well as in other parts of the world.

<doc id="400410" wikidata="Q3395302" url="?curid=400410" title="River Clwyd">
<text>The River Clwyd ( ; , ) is a river in Wales that rises in the Clocaenog Forest () northwest of Corwen. Its total length is .

It flows due south until, at Melin-y-wig, it veers north-eastwards due to the Vale of Clwyd Fault and passes through Derwen, Llanelidan, Pwllglas and Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd to Ruthin. Here it leaves the relatively narrow valley and enters a broad agricultural vale, the Vale of Clwyd (Welsh: &quot;Dyffryn Clwyd&quot;). Just south of Denbigh, it is joined by the River Clywedog. This substantial tributary also has its source in the Clocaenog Forest but drains out to the east and north of the forest and passes through Cyffylliog, Bontuchel and Rhewl before its confluence with the main river.

Then the Clwyd meanders northwards through the fertile Clwyd valley. Around north of St Asaph, the river is joined by a tributary as large as the main river, the River Elwy. In normal flows at low tide, the waters of these two rivers can be seen flowing side by side down the river with little mixing.

The River Elwy has its source a long way to the west on the flanks of Moel Seisiog south-east of Llanrwst. It also has a tributary the River Aled with its source in the upland lake Llyn Aled. The Elwy flows principally eastwards to join the Clwyd passing through few villages. At the confluence of the Elwy and the Clwyd, the river becomes tidal and enters a narrow estuary with much wildlife before meeting the Irish Sea at Rhyl.

In 1277, King Edward I sited a castle next to the Clwyd at Rhuddlan. In order for his supply barges to reach the castle, he employed 968 men to work on what was called &#x27;The Great Ditch&#x27;. He straightened the stretch of river that ran from the castle to the sea. This was an enormous feat of engineering, compared even to today&#x27;s modern standards, and it is still possible to make out the original loops and turns of the Clwyd using satellite imagery.

The former county of Clwyd, consisting of the modern-day principal areas of Denbighshire, Flintshire, Wrexham and most of Conwy, was named after the river, when it was created as a two-tier county in 1974.

Fish in the river include sea trout (sewin), as well as Atlantic salmon. In the 2017 season there were reported catches of wild brown trout, most of which were returned unharmed on a voluntary catch and release system. Rhyl and St Asaph Angling Association controls of fishing on the River Clwyd and its tributaries the River Elwy and River Aled.

<text>A flash drive (also thumb drive, memory stick, and pen drive/pendrive) is a data storage device that includes flash memory with an integrated USB interface. A typical USB drive is removable, rewritable, and smaller than an optical disc, and usually weighs less than . Since first offered for sale in late 2000, the storage capacities of USB drives range from 8 megabytes to 256 gigabytes (GB), 512 GB and 1 terabyte (TB). As of 2024, 4 TB flash drives were the largest currently in production. Some allow up to 100,000 write/erase cycles, depending on the exact type of memory chip used, and are thought to physically last between 10 and 100 years under normal circumstances (shelf storage time).

Common uses of USB flash drives are for storage, supplementary back-ups, and transferring of computer files. Compared with floppy disks or CDs, they are smaller, faster, have significantly more capacity, and are more durable due to a lack of moving parts. Additionally, they are less vulnerable to electromagnetic interference than floppy disks, and are unharmed by surface scratches (unlike CDs). However, as with any flash storage, data loss from bit leaking due to prolonged lack of electrical power and the possibility of spontaneous controller failure due to poor manufacturing could make it unsuitable for long-term archiving of data. The ability to retain data is affected by the controller&#x27;s firmware, internal data redundancy, and error correction algorithms.

Until about 2005, most desktop and laptop computers were supplied with floppy disk drives in addition to USB ports, but floppy disk drives became obsolete after widespread adoption of USB ports and the larger USB drive capacity compared to the &quot;1.44 megabyte&quot; 3.5-inch floppy disk.

USB flash drives use the USB mass storage device class standard, supported natively by modern operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and other Unix-like systems, as well as many BIOS boot ROMs. USB drives with USB 2.0 support can store more data and transfer faster than much larger optical disc drives like CD-RW or DVD-RW drives and can be read by many other systems such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, DVD players, automobile entertainment systems, and in a number of handheld devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, though the electronically similar SD card is better suited for those devices, due to their standardized form factor, which allows the card to be housed inside a device without protruding.

A flash drive consists of a small printed circuit board carrying the circuit elements and a USB connector, insulated electrically and protected inside a plastic, metal, or rubberized case, which can be carried in a pocket or on a key chain, for example. Some are equipped with an I/O indication LED that lights up or blinks upon access. The USB connector may be protected by a removable cap or by retracting into the body of the drive, although it is not likely to be damaged if unprotected. Most flash drives use a standard type-A USB connection allowing connection with a port on a personal computer, but drives for other interfaces also exist (e.g. micro-USB and USB-C ports). USB flash drives draw power from the computer via the USB connection. Some devices combine the functionality of a portable media player with USB flash storage; they require a battery only when used to play music on the go.

==History==
The basis for USB flash drives is flash memory, a type of floating-gate semiconductor memory invented by Fujio Masuoka in the early 1980s. Flash memory uses floating-gate MOSFET transistors as memory cells.

Multiple individuals have staked a claim to having invented the USB flash drive. On April 5, 1999, Amir Ban, Dov Moran, and Oron Ogdan of M-Systems, an Israeli company, filed a patent application entitled &quot;Architecture for a Universal Serial Bus-Based PC Flash Disk&quot;. The patent was subsequently granted on November 14, 2000, and these individuals have often been recognized as the inventors of the USB flash drive. Also in 1999, Shimon Shmueli, an engineer at IBM, submitted an invention disclosure asserting that he had invented the USB flash drive. A Singaporean company named Trek 2000 International is the first company known to have sold a USB flash drive, and has also maintained that it is the original inventor of the device. Finally Pua Khein-Seng, a Malaysian engineer, has also been recognized by some as a possible inventor of the device.

Given these competing inventor claims, patent disputes involving the USB flash drive have arisen over the years. Both Trek 2000 International and Netac Technology have accused others of infringing their patents on the USB flash drive. However, the question of who was the first to invent the USB flash drive has multiple claims persist, the Natec Technology get the basic copyright of American in December 7, 2004. And in the lawsuit, the PNY company paid 1,000 million dollars to Natec.

===Technology improvements===
Flash drives are often measured by the rate at which they transfer data. Transfer rates may be given in megabytes per second (MB/s), megabits per second (Mbit/s), or in optical drive multipliers such as &quot;180X&quot; (180 times 150 KiB/s). File transfer rates vary considerably among devices. Second generation flash drives have claimed to read at up to 30 MB/s and write at about half that rate, which was about 20 times faster than the theoretical transfer rate achievable by the previous model, USB 1.1, which is limited to 12 Mbit/s (1.5 MB/s) with accounted overhead. The effective transfer rate of a device is significantly affected by the data access pattern.

By 2002, USB flash drives had USB 2.0 connectivity, which has 480 Mbit/s as the transfer rate upper bound; after accounting for the protocol overhead That same year, Intel sparked widespread use of second generation USB by including them within its laptops.

By 2010, the maximum available storage capacity for the devices had reached upwards of 128 GB. USB 3.0 was slow to appear in laptops. Through 2010, the majority of laptop models still contained only USB 2.0.

In January 2013, tech company Kingston, released a flash drive with 1 TB of storage. The first USB 3.1 type-C flash drives, with read/write speeds of around 530 MB/s, were announced in March 2015. By July 2016, flash drives with 8 to 256 GB capacity were sold more frequently than those with capacities between 512 GB and 1 TB. In 2017, Kingston Technology announced the release of a 2-TB flash drive. In 2018, SanDisk announced a 1 TB USB-C flash drive, the smallest of its kind.

On a USB flash drive, one end of the device is fitted with a single Standard-A USB plug; some flash drives additionally offer a micro USB or USB-C plug, facilitating data transfers between different devices.

==Technology==

On a USB flash drive, one end of the device is fitted with a single USB plug; some flash drives additionally offer a micro USB plug, facilitating data transfers between different devices.

Inside the casing is a small printed circuit board, which has some power circuitry and a small number of surface-mounted integrated circuits (ICs). Typically, one of these ICs provides an interface between the USB connector and the onboard memory, while the other is the flash memory. Drives typically use the USB mass storage device class to communicate with the host.

=== Flash memory ===
Flash memory combines a number of older technologies, with lower cost, lower power consumption and small size made possible by advances in semiconductor device fabrication technology. The memory storage is based on earlier EPROM and EEPROM technologies. These had limited capacity, were slow for both reading and writing, required complex high-voltage drive circuitry, and could be re-written only after erasing the entire contents of the chip.

Hardware designers later developed EEPROMs with the erasure region broken up into smaller &quot;fields&quot; that could be erased individually without affecting the others. Altering the contents of a particular memory location involved copying the entire field into an off-chip buffer memory, erasing the field, modifying the data as required in the buffer, and re-writing it into the same field. This required considerable computer support, and PC-based EEPROM flash memory systems often carried their own dedicated microprocessor system. Flash drives are more or less a miniaturized version of this.

The development of high-speed serial data interfaces such as USB made semiconductor memory systems with serially accessed storage viable, and the simultaneous development of small, high-speed, low-power microprocessor systems allowed this to be incorporated into extremely compact systems. Serial access requires far fewer electrical connections for the memory chips than parallel access, simplifying the manufacture of multi-gigabyte drives.

Computers access flash memory systems very much like hard disk drives, where the controller system has full control over where information is actually stored. The actual EEPROM writing and erasure processes are, however, still very similar to the earlier systems described above.

Many low-cost MP3 players simply add extra software and a battery to a standard flash memory control microprocessor so it can also serve as a music playback decoder. Most of these players can also be used as a conventional flash drive, for storing files of any type.

===Essential components===
There are typically five parts to a flash drive:

* USB plug provides a physical interface to the host computer. Some USB flash drives use USB plug that does not protect the contacts, with the possibility of plugging it into the USB port in the wrong orientation, if the connector type is not symmetrical.
* USB mass storage controller a small microcontroller with a small amount of on-chip ROM and RAM.
* NAND flash memory chip(s) stores data (NAND flash is typically also used in digital cameras).
* Crystal oscillator produces the device&#x27;s main clock signal and controls the device&#x27;s data output through a phase-locked loop.
* Cover typically made of plastic or metal, protecting the electronics against mechanical stress and even possible short circuits.

===Additional components===
The typical device may also include:

* Jumpers and test pins – for testing during the flash drive&#x27;s manufacturing or loading code into its microcontroller.
* LEDs – indicate data transfers or data reads and writes.
* Write-protect switches – Enable or disable writing of data into memory.
* Unpopulated space – provides space to include a second memory chip. Having this second space allows the manufacturer to use a single printed circuit board for more than one storage size device.
* USB connector cover or cap – reduces the risk of damage, prevents the entry of dirt or other contaminants, and improves overall device appearance. Some flash drives use retractable USB connectors instead. Others have a swivel arrangement so that the connector can be protected without removing anything.
* Transport aid – the cap or the body often contains a hole suitable for connection to a key chain or lanyard. Connecting the cap, rather than the body, can allow the drive itself to be lost.
* Some drives offer expandable storage via an internal memory card slot, much like a memory card reader.

===Size and style of packaging===


Most USB flash drives weigh less than . While some manufacturers are competing for the smallest size, with the biggest memory, offering drives only a few millimeters larger than the USB plug itself, some manufacturers differentiate their products by using elaborate housings, which are often bulky and make the drive difficult to connect to the USB port. Because the USB port connectors on a computer housing are often closely spaced, plugging a flash drive into a USB port may block an adjacent port. Such devices may carry the USB logo only if sold with a separate extension cable. Such cables are USB-compatible but do not conform to the USB standard.

USB flash drives have been integrated into other commonly carried items, such as watches, pens, laser pointers, and even the Swiss Army Knife; others have been fitted with novelty cases such as toy cars or Lego bricks. USB flash drives with images of dragons, cats or aliens are very popular in Asia. The small size, robustness and cheapness of USB flash drives make them an increasingly popular peripheral for case modding.

===File system===
Most flash drives ship preformatted with the FAT32, or exFAT file systems. The ubiquity of the FAT32 file system allows the drive to be accessed on virtually any host device with USB support. Also, standard FAT maintenance utilities (e.g., ScanDisk) can be used to repair or retrieve corrupted data. However, because a flash drive appears as a USB-connected hard drive to the host system, the drive can be reformatted to any file system supported by the host operating system.

====Defragmenting====
Flash drives can be defragmented. There is a widespread opinion that defragmenting brings little advantage (as there is no mechanical head that moves from fragment to fragment), and that defragmenting shortens the life of the drive by making many unnecessary writes. However, some sources claim that defragmenting a flash drive can improve performance (mostly due to improved caching of the clustered data), and the additional wear on flash drives may not be significant.

====Even distribution====
Some file systems are designed to distribute usage over an entire memory device without concentrating usage on any part (e.g., for a directory) to prolong the life of simple flash memory devices. Some USB flash drives have this &#x27;wear leveling&#x27; feature built into the software controller to prolong device life, while others do not, so it is not necessarily helpful to install one of these file systems.

====Hard disk drive====
Sectors are 512 bytes long, for compatibility with hard disk drives, and the first sector can contain a master boot record and a partition table. Therefore, USB flash units can be partitioned just like hard disk drives.

===Longevity===
The memory in flash drives was commonly engineered with multi-level cell (MLC) based memory that is good for around 3,000-5,000 program-erase cycles. Nowadays Triple-level Cell (TLC) is also often used, which has up to 500 write cycles per physical sector, while some high-end flash drives have single-level cell (SLC) based memory that is good for around 30,000 writes. There is virtually no limit to the number of reads from such flash memory, so a well-worn USB drive may be write-protected to help ensure the life of individual cells. 

Estimation of flash memory endurance is a challenging subject that depends on the SLC/MLC/TLC memory type, size of the flash memory chips, and actual usage pattern. As a result, a USB flash drive can last from a few days to several hundred years.

Regardless of the endurance of the memory itself, the USB connector hardware is specified to withstand only around 1,500 insert-removal cycles.

==Counterfeit products==
Counterfeit USB flash drives are sometimes sold with claims of having higher capacities than they actually possess. These are typically low-capacity USB drives with modified flash memory controller firmware that emulates larger capacity drives (for example, a 2 GB drive being marketed as a 64 GB drive). When plugged into a computer, they report being the larger capacity they were sold as, but when data is written to them, either the write fails, the drive freezes up, or it overwrites existing data. Software tools exist to check and detect fake USB drives,
 and in some cases it is possible to repair these devices to remove the false capacity information and use its real storage limit.

==File transfer speeds==

Transfer speeds are technically determined by the slowest of three factors: the USB version used, the speed in which the USB controller device can read and write data onto the flash memory, and the speed of the hardware bus, especially in the case of add-on USB ports.

USB flash drives usually specify their read and write speeds in megabytes per second (MB/s); read speed is usually faster. These speeds are for optimal conditions; real-world speeds are usually slower. In particular, circumstances that often lead to speeds much lower than advertised are transfer (particularly writing) of many small files rather than a few very large ones, and mixed reading and writing to the same device.

In a typical well-conducted review of a number of high-performance USB 3.0 drives, a drive that could read large files at 68 MB/s and write at 46 MB/s, could only manage 14 MB/s and 0.3 MB/s with many small files. When combining streaming reads and writes the speed of another drive, the drive could read at 92 MB/s and write at 70 MB/s, was 8 MB/s. These differences differ radically from one drive to another; some could write small files 10% faster than for large ones. The examples given are chosen to illustrate extremes.

==Uses==

===Personal data transport===
The most common use of flash drives is to transport and store personal files, such as documents, pictures and videos. Individuals also store medical information on flash drives for emergencies and disaster preparation.

===Secure storage of data, application and software files===
With wide deployment of flash drives in various environments (secured or otherwise), data and information security remain critical issues. Biometrics and encryption are becoming the norm as data security needs increase; on-the-fly encryption systems are particularly useful in this regard, as they can transparently encrypt large amounts of data. In some cases, a secure USB drive may use a hardware-based encryption mechanism that uses a hardware module instead of software for strongly encrypting data. IEEE 1667 is an attempt to create a generic authentication platform for USB drives. It is supported in Windows 7 and Windows Vista (Service Pack 2 with a hotfix).

===Computer forensics and law enforcement===
A recent development for the use of a USB Flash Drive as an application carrier is to carry the Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor (COFEE) application developed by Microsoft. COFEE is a set of applications designed to search for and extract digital evidence on computers confiscated from suspects. Forensic software is required not to alter in any way the information stored on the computer being examined. Other forensic suites run from CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, but cannot store data on the media they are run from (although they can write to other attached devices, such as external drives or memory sticks).

===Updating motherboard firmware===
Motherboard firmware (including BIOS and UEFI) can be updated using USB flash drives. Usually, new firmware is downloaded and placed onto a FAT16- or FAT32-formatted USB flash drive connected to a system which is to be updated, and the path to the new firmware image is selected within the update component of system&#x27;s firmware. Some motherboard manufacturers also allow such updates without the need to enter the system&#x27;s firmware update component, making it possible to easily recover systems with corrupted firmware.

In addition, HP has introduced a &quot;USB floppy drive key&quot;, an ordinary USB flash drive with the capacity to emulate floppy drives, allowing it to be used for updating system firmware where direct use of USB flash drives is not supported. The desired mode of operation, regular USB mass storage device or floppy drive emulation, is selected via sliding a switch on the device&#x27;s housing.

===Booting operating systems===

Most current PC firmware permits booting from a USB drive, allowing the launch of an operating system from a bootable flash drive. Such a configuration is known as a Live USB.

Original flash memory designs had very limited estimated lifetimes. The failure mechanism for flash memory cells is analogous to a metal fatigue mode; the device fails by refusing to write new data to specific cells that have been subject to many read-write cycles over the device&#x27;s lifetime. Premature failure of a &quot;live USB&quot; could be circumvented by using a flash drive with a write-lock switch as a WORM device, identical to a live CD. Originally, this potential failure mode limited the use of &quot;live USB&quot; system to special-purpose applications or temporary tasks, such as:

* Loading a minimal, hardened kernel for embedded applications (e.g., network router, firewall).
* Bootstrapping an operating system install or disk cloning operation, often across a network.
* Maintenance tasks, such as virus scanning or low-level data repair, without the primary host operating system loaded.

, newer flash memory designs have much higher estimated lifetimes. Several manufacturers are now offering warranties of 5 years or more. Such warranties should make the device more attractive for more applications. By reducing the probability of the device&#x27;s premature failure, flash memory devices can now be considered for use where a magnetic disk would normally have been required. Flash drives have also experienced an exponential growth in their storage capacity over time (following the Moore&#x27;s Law growth curve). As of 2013, single-packaged devices with capacities of 1 TB are readily available, and devices with 16 GB capacity are very economical. Storage capacities in this range have traditionally been considered to offer adequate space, because they allow enough space for both the operating system software and some free space for the user&#x27;s data.

===Operating system installation media===
Installers of some operating systems can be stored to a flash drive instead of a CD or DVD, including various Linux distributions, Windows 7 and newer versions, and macOS. In particular, Mac OS X 10.7 is distributed only online, through the Mac App Store, or on flash drives; for a MacBook Air with Boot Camp and no external optical drive, a flash drive can be used to run installation of Windows or Linux from USB, a process that can be automated via the use of tools like the Universal USB Installer or Rufus.

However, for installation of Windows 7 and later versions, using USB flash drive with hard disk drive emulation as detected in PC&#x27;s firmware is recommended in order to boot from it. Transcend is the only manufacturer of USB flash drives containing such a feature.

Furthermore, for installation of Windows XP, using a USB flash drive with a storage limit of at most 2 GB is recommended in order to boot from it.

===Windows ReadyBoost===
In Windows Vista and later versions, ReadyBoost feature allows flash drives (from 4 GB in case of Windows Vista) to augment operating system memory.

===Application carriers===
Flash drives are used to carry applications that run on the host computer without requiring installation. While any standalone application can in principle be used this way, many programs store data, configuration information, etc. on the hard drive and registry of the host computer.

The U3 company works with drive makers (parent company SanDisk as well as others) to deliver custom versions of applications designed for Microsoft Windows from a special flash drive; U3-compatible devices are designed to autoload a menu when plugged into a computer running Windows. Applications must be modified for the U3 platform not to leave any data on the host machine. U3 also provides a software framework for independent software vendors interested in their platform.

Ceedo is an alternative product that does not require Windows applications to be modified in order for them to be carried and run on the drive.

Similarly, other application virtualization solutions and portable application creators, such as VMware ThinApp (for Windows) or RUNZ (for Linux) can be used to run software from a flash drive without installation.

In October 2010, Apple Inc. released their newest iteration of the MacBook Air, which had the system&#x27;s restore files contained on a USB hard drive rather than the traditional install CDs, because the Air did not include an optical drive.

A wide range of portable applications, which are all free of charge, and able to run off a computer running Windows without storing anything on the host computer&#x27;s drives or registry, can be found in the list of portable software.

===Backup===
Some value-added resellers are now using a flash drive as part of small-business turnkey solutions (e.g., point-of-sale systems). The drive is used as a backup medium: at the close of business each night, the drive is inserted, and a database backup is saved to the drive. Alternatively, the drive can be left inserted through the business day, and data regularly updated. In either case, the drive is removed at night and taken offsite.

* This is simple for the end-user, and more likely to be done.
* The drive is small and convenient, and more likely to be carried off-site for safety.
* The drives are less fragile mechanically and magnetically than tapes.
* The capacity is often large enough for several backup images of critical data.
* Flash drives are cheaper than many other backup systems.

Flash drives also have disadvantages. They are easy to lose and facilitate unauthorized backups. A lesser setback for flash drives is that they have only one tenth the capacity of hard drives manufactured around their time of distribution.

=== Password Reset Disk ===
Password Reset Disk is a feature of the Windows operating system. If a user sets up a Password Reset Disk, it can be used to reset the password on the computer it was set up on.

===Audio players===

Many companies make small solid-state digital audio players, essentially producing flash drives with sound output and a simple user interface. Examples include the Creative MuVo, Philips GoGear and the first generation iPod shuffle. Some of these players are true USB flash drives as well as music players; others do not support general-purpose data storage. Other applications requiring storage, such as digital voice or sound recording, can also be combined with flash drive functionality.

Many of the smallest players are powered by a permanently fitted rechargeable battery, charged from the USB interface. Fancier devices that function as a digital audio player have a USB host port (type A female typically).

===Media storage and marketing===

Digital audio files can be transported from one computer to another like any other file, and played on a compatible media player (with caveats for DRM-locked files). In addition, many home Hi-Fi and car stereo head units are now equipped with a USB port. This allows a USB flash drive containing media files in a variety of formats to be played directly on devices which support the format. Some LCD monitors for consumer HDTV viewing have a dedicated USB port through which music and video files can also be played without use of a personal computer.

Artists have sold or given away USB flash drives, with the first instance believed to be in 2004 when the German punk band Wizo released the &quot;Stick EP&quot;, only as a USB drive. In addition to five high-bitrate MP3s, it also included a video, pictures, lyrics, and guitar tablature. Subsequently, artists including Nine Inch Nails and Kylie Minogue have released music and promotional material on USB flash drives. The first USB album to be released in the UK was &quot;Kiss Does... Rave&quot;, a compilation album released by the Kiss Network in April 2007.

===Brand and product promotion===
The availability of inexpensive flash drives has enabled them to be used for promotional and marketing purposes, particularly within technical and computer-industry circles (e.g., technology trade shows). They may be given away for free, sold at less than wholesale price, or included as a bonus with another purchased product.

Usually, such drives will be custom-stamped with a company&#x27;s logo, as a form of advertising. The drive may be blank, or preloaded with graphics, documentation, web links, Flash animation or other multimedia, and free or demonstration software. Some preloaded drives are read-only, while others are configured with both read-only and user-writable segments. Such dual-partition drives are more expensive.

Flash drives can be set up to automatically launch stored presentations, websites, articles, and any other software immediately on insertion of the drive using the Microsoft Windows AutoRun feature. Autorunning software this way does not work on all computers, and it is normally disabled by security-conscious users.

===Arcades===
In the arcade game &quot;In the Groove&quot; and more commonly &quot;In The Groove 2&quot;, flash drives are used to transfer high scores, screenshots, dance edits, and combos throughout sessions. As of software revision 21 (R21), players can also store custom songs and play them on any machine on which this feature is enabled. While use of flash drives is common, the drive must be Linux compatible.

In the arcade games &quot;Pump it Up NX2&quot; and &quot;Pump it Up NXA&quot;, a specially produced flash drive is used as a &quot;save file&quot; for unlocked songs, as well as for progressing in the WorldMax and Brain Shower sections of the game.

In the arcade game &quot;Dance Dance Revolution X&quot;, an exclusive USB flash drive was made by Konami for the purpose of the link feature from its Sony PlayStation 2 counterpart. However, any USB flash drive can be used in this arcade game.

==Conveniences==
Flash drives use little power, have no fragile moving parts, and for most capacities are small and light. Data stored on flash drives is impervious to mechanical shock, magnetic fields, scratches and dust. These properties make them suitable for transporting data from place to place and keeping the data readily at hand.

Flash drives also store data densely compared to many removable media. In mid-2009, 256 GB drives became available, with the ability to hold many times more data than a DVD (54 DVDs) or even a Blu-ray (10 BDs).

Flash drives implement the USB mass storage device class so that most modern operating systems can read and write to them without installing device drivers. The flash drives present a simple block-structured logical unit to the host operating system, hiding the individual complex implementation details of the various underlying flash memory devices. The operating system can use any file system or block addressing scheme. Some computers can boot up from flash drives.

Specially manufactured flash drives are available that have a tough rubber or metal casing designed to be waterproof and virtually &quot;unbreakable&quot;. These flash drives retain their memory after being submerged in water, and even through a machine wash. Leaving such a flash drive out to dry completely before allowing current to run through it has been known to result in a working drive with no future problems. Channel Five&#x27;s &quot;Gadget Show&quot; cooked one of these flash drives with propane, froze it with dry ice, submerged it in various acidic liquids, ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar. A company specializing in recovering lost data from computer drives managed to recover all the data on the drive. All data on the other removable storage devices tested, using optical or magnetic technologies, were destroyed.

==Comparison with other portable storage==
===Tape===
The applications of current data tape cartridges hardly overlap those of flash drives: on tape, cost per gigabyte is very low for large volumes, but the individual drives and media are expensive. Media have a very high capacity and very fast transfer speeds, but store data sequentially and are very slow for random access of data. While disk-based backup is now the primary medium of choice for most companies, tape backup is still popular for taking data off-site for worst-case scenarios and for very large volumes (more than a few hundreds of TB). See LTO tapes.

===Floppy disk===

Floppy disk drives are rarely fitted to modern computers and are obsolete for normal purposes, although internal and external drives can be fitted if required. Floppy disks may be the method of choice for transferring data to and from very old computers without USB or booting from floppy disks, and so they are sometimes used to change the firmware on, for example, BIOS chips. Devices with removable storage like older Yamaha music keyboards are also dependent on floppy disks, which require computers to process them. Newer devices are built with USB flash drive support.

Floppy disk hardware emulators exist which effectively utilize the internal connections and physical attributes of a floppy disk drive to utilize a device where a USB flash drive emulates the storage space of a floppy disk in a solid state form, and can be divided into a number of individual virtual floppy disk images using individual data channels.

===Optical media===
The various writable and re-writable forms of CD and DVD are portable storage media supported by the vast majority of computers as of 2008. CD-R, DVD-R, and DVD+R can be written to only once, RW varieties up to about 1,000 erase/write cycles, while modern NAND-based flash drives often last for 500,000 or more erase/write cycles. DVD-RAM discs are the most suitable optical discs for data storage involving much rewriting.

Optical storage devices are among the cheapest methods of mass data storage after the hard drive. They are slower than their flash-based counterparts. Standard 120 mm optical discs are larger than flash drives and more subject to damage. Smaller optical media do exist, such as business card CD-Rs which have the same dimensions as a credit card, and the slightly less convenient but higher capacity 80 mm recordable MiniCD and Mini DVD. The small discs are more expensive than the standard size, and do not work in all drives.

Universal Disk Format (UDF) version 1.50 and above has facilities to support rewritable discs like sparing tables and virtual allocation tables, spreading usage over the entire surface of a disc and maximising life, but many older operating systems do not support this format. Packet-writing utilities such as DirectCD and InCD are available but produce discs that are not universally readable (although based on the UDF standard). The Mount Rainier standard addresses this shortcoming in CD-RW media by running the older file systems on top of it and performing defect management for those standards, but it requires support from both the CD/DVD burner and the operating system. Many drives made today do not support Mount Rainier, and many older operating systems such as Windows XP and below, and Linux kernels older than 2.6.2, do not support it (later versions do). Essentially CDs/DVDs are a good way to record a great deal of information cheaply and have the advantage of being readable by most standalone players, but they are poor at making ongoing small changes to a large collection of information. Flash drives&#x27; ability to do this is their major advantage over optical media.

===Flash memory cards===

Flash memory cards, e.g., Secure Digital cards, are available in various formats and capacities, and are used by many consumer devices. However, while virtually all PCs have USB ports, allowing the use of USB flash drives, memory card readers are not commonly supplied as standard equipment (particularly with desktop computers). Although inexpensive card readers are available that read many common formats, this results in two pieces of portable equipment (card plus reader) rather than one.

Some manufacturers, aiming at a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; solution, have produced card readers that approach the size and form of USB flash drives (e.g., Kingston MobileLite, SanDisk MobileMate) These readers are limited to a specific subset of memory card formats (such as SD, microSD, or Memory Stick), and often completely enclose the card, offering durability and portability approaching, if not quite equal to, that of a flash drive. Although the combined cost of a mini-reader and a memory card is usually slightly higher than a USB flash drive of comparable capacity, the reader + card solution offers additional flexibility of use, and virtually &quot;unlimited&quot; capacity. The ubiquity of SD cards is such that, circa 2011, due to economies of scale, their price is now less than an equivalent-capacity USB flash drive, even with the added cost of a USB SD card reader.

An additional advantage of memory cards is that many consumer devices (e.g., digital cameras, portable music players) cannot make use of USB flash drives (even if the device has a USB port), whereas the memory cards used by the devices can be read by PCs with a card reader.

===External hard disk===
Particularly with the advent of USB, external hard disks have become widely available and inexpensive. External hard disk drives currently cost less per gigabyte than flash drives and are available in larger capacities. Some hard drives support alternative and faster interfaces than USB 2.0 (e.g., Thunderbolt, FireWire and eSATA). For consecutive sector writes and reads (for example, from an unfragmented file), most hard drives can provide a much higher sustained data rate than current NAND flash memory, though mechanical latencies seriously impact hard drive performance.

Unlike solid-state memory, hard drives are susceptible to damage by shock (e.g., a short fall) and vibration, have limitations on use at high altitude, and although shielded by their casings, are vulnerable when exposed to strong magnetic fields. In terms of overall mass, hard drives are usually larger and heavier than flash drives; however, hard disks sometimes weigh less per unit of storage. Like flash drives, hard disks also suffer from file fragmentation, which can reduce access speed.

===External solid-state drive===
Compared to external solid-state drives, USB flash drives are usually built using lower-cost and lower-performance flash memory, resulting in lower overall performance.

===Obsolete devices===
Audio tape cassettes and high-capacity floppy disks (e.g., Imation SuperDisk), and other forms of drives with removable magnetic media, such as the Iomega Zip drive and Jaz drives, are now largely obsolete and rarely used. There are products in today&#x27;s market that will emulate these legacy drives for both tape and disk (SCSI1/SCSI2, SASI, Magneto optic, Ricoh ZIP, Jaz, IBM3590/ Fujitsu 3490E and Bernoulli for example) in state-of-the-art Compact Flash storage devices – CF2SCSI.

===Encryption and security===
As highly portable media, USB flash drives are easily lost or stolen. All USB flash drives can have their contents encrypted using third-party disk encryption software, which can often be run directly from the USB drive without installation (for example, FreeOTFE), although some, such as BitLocker, require the user to have administrative rights on every computer it is run on.

Archiving software can achieve a similar result by creating encrypted ZIP or RAR files.

Some manufacturers have produced USB flash drives which use hardware-based encryption as part of the design, removing the need for third-party encryption software. In limited circumstances these drives have been shown to have security problems, and are typically more expensive than software-based systems, which are available for free.

A minority of flash drives support biometric fingerprinting to confirm the user&#x27;s identity. As of mid-, this was an expensive alternative to standard password protection offered on many new USB flash storage devices. Most fingerprint scanning drives rely upon the host operating system to validate the fingerprint via a software driver, often restricting the drive to Microsoft Windows computers. However, there are USB drives with fingerprint scanners which use controllers that allow access to protected data without any authentication.

Some manufacturers deploy physical authentication tokens in the form of a flash drive. These are used to control access to a sensitive system by containing encryption keys or, more commonly, communicating with security software on the target machine. The system is designed so the target machine will not operate except when the flash drive device is plugged into it. Some of these &quot;PC lock&quot; devices also function as normal flash drives when plugged into other machines.

==Controversies==

===Criticisms===
====Failures====
Like all flash memory devices, flash drives can sustain only a limited number of write and erase cycles before the drive fails. This should be a consideration when using a flash drive to run application software or an operating system. To address this, as well as space limitations, some developers have produced special versions of operating systems (such as Linux in Live USB) or commonplace applications (such as Mozilla Firefox) designed to run from flash drives. These are typically optimized for size and configured to place temporary or intermediate files in the computer&#x27;s main RAM rather than store them temporarily on the flash drive.

When used in the same manner as external rotating drives (hard drives, optical drives, or floppy drives), i.e. in ignorance of their technology, USB drives&#x27; failure is more likely to be sudden: while rotating drives &quot;can&quot; fail instantaneously, they more frequently give some indication (noises, slowness) that they are about to fail, often with enough advance warning that data can be removed before total failure. USB drives give little or no advance warning of failure. Furthermore, when internal wear-leveling is applied to prolong life of the flash drive, once failure of even part of the memory occurs it can be difficult or impossible to use the remainder of the drive, which differs from magnetic media, where bad sectors can be marked permanently not to be used.

Most USB flash drives do not include a write protection mechanism. This feature, which gradually became less common, consists of a switch on the housing of the drive itself, that prevents the host computer from writing or modifying data on the drive. For example, write protection makes a device suitable for repairing virus-contaminated host computers without the risk of infecting a USB flash drive itself. In contrast to SD cards, write protection on USB flash drives (when available) is connected to the drive circuitry, and is handled by the drive itself instead of the host (on SD cards handling of the write-protection notch is optional).

A drawback to the small physical size of flash drives is that they are easily misplaced or otherwise lost. This is a particular problem if they contain sensitive data (see data security). As a consequence, some manufacturers have added encryption hardware to their drives, although software encryption systems which can be used in conjunction with any mass storage medium will achieve the same result. Most drives can be attached to keychains or lanyards. The USB plug is usually retractable or fitted with a removable protective cap.

===Security threats===
====USB killer====

Similar in appearance to a USB flash drive, a USB killer is a circuit which charges its capacitors to a high voltage using the power supply pins of a USB port, then discharges that voltage through the data pins. This standalone device can instantly and permanently damage or destroy any host hardware that it is connected to.

=== &quot;Handmade&quot; USB drives ===
&quot;Handmade&quot; USB drives, containing movies and other related content, have also been reported.

==Current and future developments==
Semiconductor corporations have worked to reduce the cost of the components in a flash drive by integrating various flash drive functions in a single chip, thereby reducing the part-count and overall package-cost.

Flash drive capacities on the market increase continually. High speed has become a standard for modern flash drives. Capacities exceeding 256 GB were available on the market as early as 2009.

Lexar attempted to introduce a &quot;USB FlashCard&quot;, which would be a compact USB flash drive intended to replace various kinds of flash memory cards. Pretec introduced a similar card, which also plugs into any USB port, but is just one quarter the thickness of the Lexar model. Until 2008, SanDisk manufactured a product called SD Plus, which was a SecureDigital card with a USB connector.

SanDisk introduced a digital rights management technology called FlashCP that they had purchased in 2005 to control the storage and usage of copyrighted materials on flash drives, primarily for use by students.

<text>Kenneth Gilbert More (20 September 1914 – 12 July 1982) was an English actor.

Initially achieving fame in the comedy &quot;Genevieve&quot; (1953), he appeared in many roles as a carefree, happy-go-lucky gent. Films from this period include &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (1954), &quot;Raising a Riot&quot; (1955), &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; (1957), &quot;The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw&quot; (1958) and &quot;Next to No Time&quot; (1958). He also played more serious roles as a leading man, beginning with &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1955), &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956), &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (1958), &quot;North West Frontier&quot; (1959), &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1959) and &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; (1960).

Although his career declined in the early 1960s, two of his own favourite films date from this time – &quot;The Comedy Man&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Greengage Summer&quot; (1961) with Susannah York, &quot;one of the happiest films on which I have ever worked.&quot; He also enjoyed a revival in the much-acclaimed TV adaptation of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (1967) and the &quot;Father Brown&quot; series (1974).
== Early life ==
Kenneth More was born at &#x27;Raeden&#x27;, Vicarage Way, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, the only son of Charles Gilbert More, a Royal Naval Air Service pilot, and Edith Winifred Watkins, the daughter of a Cardiff solicitor. He was educated at Victoria College, Jersey, having spent part of his childhood in the Channel Islands, where his father was general manager of the Jersey Eastern Railway.

After his graduation, More followed the family tradition by training to become a civil engineer. However, he abandoned his training and worked for a while in Sainsbury&#x27;s on the Strand.

When More was 17 his father died, and he applied to join the Royal Air Force but failed the medical test for equilibrium. He then travelled to Canada, intending to work as a fur trapper, but was sent back to Britain because he lacked immigration documents.

=== Windmill Theatre ===
On his return from Canada, a business associate of his father, Vivian Van Damm, agreed to offer him work as a stagehand at the Windmill Theatre, where his job included shifting scenery and helping to get the nude players off stage during its &quot;Revudeville&quot; variety shows. After a chance moment on stage helping a comic, he realized that he wanted to act and was soon promoted to playing straight man in the &quot;Revudeville&quot; comedy routines, appearing in his first sketch in August 1935.

He played there for a year, which then led to regular work in repertory, including Newcastle, performing in plays such as &quot;Burke and Hare&quot; and &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Other stage appearances included &quot;Do You Remember?&quot; (1937), &quot;Stage Hands Never Lie&quot; (1937) and &quot;Distinguished Gathering&quot; (1937).

More continued his theatre work until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He had an occasional small role in films such as &quot;Look Up and Laugh&quot; (1935).

=== Second World War ===

Before the war, More was working as an actor in Wolverhampton at the repertory company and living at 166 Waterloo Road. According to the 1939 register, he was also ambulance driver number 207 in preparation for the outbreak of war. More received a commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy and saw active service aboard the cruiser and the aircraft carrier .

=== Resumption of acting career ===
On demobilisation in 1946 More resumed work at the Wolverhampton repertory company, then appeared on stage in the West End in &quot;And No Birds Sing&quot; (1946).

More appeared in Paul Vercors&#x27; play &quot;The Silence of the Sea&quot; broadcast on the day British TV recommenced after the war - 7 June 1946, and this was followed by a number of television roles including Badger in an adaptation of &quot;Toad of Toad Hall&quot; (1946), and a small role in the film &quot;School for Secrets&quot; (1946). He was seen by Noël Coward playing a small role on stage in &quot;Power Without Glory&quot; (1947), which led to his casting in Coward&#x27;s &quot;Peace In Our Time&quot; (1948) on stage.

More&#x27;s earliest small roles in films date from before the war, but around this time, he began to appear regularly on the big screen. For a small role in &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot; (1948) as Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans, he was paid £500. He thought this film would launch him more than it did and held off from accepting other roles, which resulted in him &quot;nearly starving&quot;. He took minor parts in &quot;Man on the Run&quot; (1949), &quot;Now Barabbas&quot; (1949), and &quot;Stop Press Girl&quot; (1949).

==Stardom==
=== Rising reputation ===
More achieved a notable stage success in &quot;The Way Things Go&quot; (1950) with Ronald Squire, from whom More later claimed he learned his stage technique.

He was in demand for minor roles on screen such as &quot;Morning Departure&quot; (1950) and &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot; (1950). More had a good part as a British agent in &quot;The Clouded Yellow&quot; (1950) for Ralph Thomas.

He could also be seen in &quot;The Franchise Affair&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Galloping Major&quot; (1951). More&#x27;s first Hollywood-financed film was &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot; (1951) where he played a co-pilot. Thomas cast him in another strong support part in &quot;Appointment with Venus&quot; (1952).

More&#x27;s name was placed above the title billing for the first time with a low budget comedy, &quot;Brandy for the Parson&quot; (1952), playing a smuggler.

=== &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; ===
Roland Culver recommended More audition for a part in a new play by Terence Rattigan, &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1952); he was successful and achieved tremendous critical acclaim in the role of Freddie. More later wrote &quot; Critics hailed me almost as an overnight discovery, conveniently forgetting I was already thirty-eight, and that I had been working in the theatre for nearly twenty years.&quot;

During the play&#x27;s run he appeared as a worried parent in a thriller, &quot;The Yellow Balloon&quot; (1953). He was in another Hollywood-financed film, &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (1953), playing a colleague of Clark Gable.

=== Film stardom: &quot;Genevieve&quot; and &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; ===
Director Henry Cornelius approached More during the run of &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; and offered him £3,500 to play one of the four leads in a comedy, &quot;Genevieve&quot; (1953) (a part turned down by Guy Middleton). More said Cornelius never saw him in the play but cast him on the basis of his work in &quot;The Galloping Major&quot;. More recalls &quot;the shooting of the picture was hell. Everything went wrong, even the weather.&quot; The resulting film was a huge success at the British box office.

More next made &quot;Our Girl Friday&quot; (1953) and &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (1954), the latter for Ralph Thomas. Both films were made before the release of &quot;Genevieve&quot; so More&#x27;s fee was relatively small; &quot;Our Girl Friday&quot; was a commercial disappointment but &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; was the biggest hit at the 1954 British box office and the most successful film in the history of Rank. More received a BAFTA Award as best newcomer.

More appeared in a TV production of &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; in 1954, which was seen by an audience of 11 million. More signed a five-year contract with Sir Alexander Korda at £10,000 a year. &#x27;

He was now established as one of Britain&#x27;s biggest stars and Korda announced plans to feature him in two films based on true stories, one, &quot;The Alcock and Brown Story&quot; about the Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown in 1919 also featuring Denholm Elliott, and the other Clifton James, the double for Field Marshal Montgomery. The first film was never made and the second (&quot;I Was Monty&#x27;s Double&quot;) with another actor. Korda also wanted More to star in a new version of &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;, &quot;Storm Over the Nile&quot; (1956) but he turned it down.

However, More did accept Korda&#x27;s offer to appear in a film adaptation of &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1955) gaining the Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his performance. The film was something of a critical and commercial disappointment (More felt Vivien Leigh was miscast in the lead) but still widely seen. He also did the narration for Korda&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Loved Redheads&quot; (1955).

When &quot;The Alcock and Brown Story&quot; was cancelled, More was reassigned to another film for Korda, the domestic comedy &quot;Raising a Riot&quot; (1955), directed by Wendy Toye. This was the eighth most popular movie at the British box office in 1955, and much of the film&#x27;s success was attributed to More&#x27;s appeal.

=== &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; ===
More received an offer from David Lean to play the lead role in an adaptation of &quot;The Wind Cannot Read&quot; by Richard Mason. More was unsure about whether the public would accept him in such a straightforwardly romantic part and refused it, a decision he later regarded as &quot;the greatest mistake I ever made professionally&quot;. Lean dropped the project and was not involved in the eventual 1958 film version, which starred Dirk Bogarde and was directed by Ralph Thomas.

Instead, More played the Royal Air Force fighter ace, Douglas Bader, in &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956), a part refused by Richard Burton. It was the most popular British film of the year. By 1956, More&#x27;s asking price was £25,000 a film. In October 1956, John Davis, managing director of Rank, announced him as one of the actors under contract to Rank that Davis thought would become an international star.

More received offers to go to Hollywood, but refused them, unsure his persona would be effective there. However, he started working with U.S. co-stars and directors more often. In February 1957, he signed a contract with Daniel M. Angel and was to make ten films over five years, seven which would be distributed by Rank and three by 20th Century Fox. In June of that year, he said:
Hollywood has been hitting two extremes – either a Biblical de Mille spectacular or a &quot;Baby Doll&quot;. Britain does two other kinds of movie as well as anyone – a certain type of high comedy and a kind of semi-documentary. I believe we (the British film industry) should hit these hard.
His next film, &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; (1957), was a high comedy, based on the play by J. M. Barrie. It was released by Columbia Pictures. It was directed by Lewis Gilbert who also had made &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; and who later said:
I was very fond of Kenny as an actor, although he wasn&#x27;t particularly versatile. What he could do, he did very well. His strengths were his ability to portray charm; basically he was the officer returning from the war and he was superb in that kind of role. The minute that kind of role went out of existence, he began to go down as a box office star.
Regarding his performance in this film, critic David Shipman wrote:
It was not just that he had superb comic timing: one could see absolutely why the family trusted their fates to him. No other British actor had come so close to that dependable, reliable quality of the great Hollywood stars – you would trust him through thick and thin. And he was more humorous than, say, Cary Grant, more down-to-earth than, say, Gary Cooper.
&quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; was the third most popular movie at the British box office in 1957.

In 1957, More had announced that he would play the lead role of a captain caught up in the Indian Mutiny in &quot;Night Runners of Bengal&quot; but the film was never made. More refused an offer from Roy Ward Baker to play a German POW in &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; (1957), but agreed to play the lead role of Charles Lightoller in the Titanic film for the same director, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (1958). This was the first of a seven-year contract with Rank at a fee of £40,000 a film. It was popular though failed to recover its large cost; it was one of More&#x27;s most critically acclaimed films.

For his next film, More had an American co-star Betsy Drake, &quot;Next to No Time&quot; (1958) directed by Cornelius. It was a minor success at the box office.

More then made &quot;The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw&quot; (1958), a Western spoof originally written for Clifton Webb. He had an American director (Raoul Walsh) and co-star (Jayne Mansfield), although the film was shot in Spain. It was the tenth most-popular movie at the British box office in 1958.

In December 1958 More announced he had a contract with Rank to make seven films in five years at a flat salary (of which the first was &quot;Night to Remember&quot;), plus three films in five years for Dan Angel and 20th Century Fox of which &quot;Sheriff&quot; was the first. He also said he would no longer make a film without an American co star.

More said he had been offered a production deal of his own releasing through British Lion but did not want to do it saying &quot;I&#x27;ve got what I want, and I&#x27;ve never been lucky in business anyway. I think too many actors also try to be their own administrators these days, and I see them walking around with worried faces. Some people have the flair for it, of course. I don&#x27;t.&quot;

More said he would not appear on television. &quot;If I do, it’ll kill the theatre business that night. That’s true of any big actor in Britain today. It was terrible what happened to the theatres the night Laurence Olivier went on. : Nobody went. So people like myself stay off television, though they offer fantastic sums. I was offered £123,000 (about $640,000) to appear in one television series; and most of that money would have been tax-free in one way or another.” 

More made another film with Ralph Thomas, a remake of &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1959), with a Hollywood co star (Taina Elg). It was a hit in Britain.

He appeared in a Fox-Rank film set in India, &quot;North West Frontier&quot; (1959), co-starring Lauren Bacall and directed by J. Lee Thompson. It was another success in Britain but not in the US. He agreed to star in &quot;The Angry Silence&quot; at a discount fee but pulled out in order to make &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; (1960), directed by Gilbert, a more lucrative assignment (More&#x27;s role was played by Richard Attenborough). This film was a hit in Britain and the US.

More was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Odeon Cinema, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

==Later career==
=== Decline in film popularity ===
In 1960, Rank&#x27;s Managing Director John Davis gave permission for More to work outside his contract to appear in &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961). More, however, made the mistake of heckling and swearing at Davis at a BAFTA dinner at the Dorchester, losing the role (which went to David Niven).

More went on to make a comedy, &quot;&quot;Man In The Moon&quot;&quot; (1960), which flopped at the box office, &quot;his first real flop&quot; since becoming a star, according to Shipman. He returned to the stage directing &quot;The Angry Deep&quot; in Brighton in 1960.

More and Gilbert were reunited on &quot;The Greengage Summer&quot; (1961) which remains one of More&#x27;s favourite films, although Gilbert felt the star was miscast.

He returned to military roles as one of many stars in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962) playing Beachmaster Captain Colin Maud, and then he played the lead in a comedy produced by Daniel Angel and directed by Wendy Toyes, &quot;We Joined the Navy&quot; (1962), which was poorly received.

More says he accepted the lead in the low-budget youth film, &quot;Some People&quot; (1962), because he had no other offers at the time. The movie was profitable.

Some felt More&#x27;s popularity declined when he left his second wife to live with Angela Douglas who had been in the cast of &quot;Some People&quot;. Others argued his appeal was simply becoming out of date. Film writer Andrew Spicer thought that &quot;More&#x27;s persona was so strongly associated with traditional middle class values that his stardom could not survive the shift towards working class iconoclasts&quot; during that decade. Another writer, Christopher Sandford, felt that &quot;as the sixties began and the star of the ironic, postmodernist school rose, More was derided as a ludicrous old fogey with crinkly hair and a tweed jacket.&quot;

He returned to television with the lead in &quot;Heart to Heart&quot; written by Terence Rattigan. More received an offer to star in &quot;The Comedy Man&quot; directed by Alvin Rakoff, but the film was not released for two years. More then made &quot;Collect Your Hand Luggage&quot; (1963) for television directed by Ted Kotcheff.

He was going to star in a film about the Cyprus Emergency called &quot;The Cyprus Story&quot;, playing an intelligence officer who falls in love with Elsa Martinelli who plays the daughter of an EOKA sympathiser. Pre-production was difficult - director Robert Day quit and was replaced by Roy Baker, however filming, which was to start in June 1963 in Cyprus, did not proceed.

More went back to the stage, appearing in &quot;Out of the Crocodile&quot; (1963) and &quot;Our Man Crichton&quot; (1964–65), which ran for six months. He also appeared in a small screen version of Simon Raven&#x27;s &quot;The Scapegoat&quot;.

He appeared in a 35-minute prologue to &quot;The Collector&quot; (1965) at the special request of director William Wyler, but it ended up being removed entirely from the final film.

=== Revival ===
More&#x27;s popularity recovered in the 1960s through West End stage performances and television roles, especially following his success in &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (1967). Critic David Shipman said More&#x27;s personal notices for his performance on stage in &quot;The Secretary Bird&quot; (1968) &quot;must be among the best accorded any light comedian during this century&quot;.

On screen More had a small role in &quot;Dark of the Sun&quot; (1968) and a bigger one in &quot;Fräulein Doktor&quot; (1969). He was one of many names in &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969) and &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969). He took the role of the Ghost of Christmas Present in &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1970) and had long stage runs with a revival of &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (1970) and &quot;Getting On&quot; by Alan Bennett (1971).

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1970 New Year Honours.

=== Later career ===
More&#x27;s later stage appearances included &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; (1973) and &quot;On Approval&quot; (1977). He played the title character in ATV&#x27;s &quot;Father Brown&quot; (1974) series.

His later film roles included &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; (1976), &quot;Where Time Began&quot; (1977), &quot;Leopard in the Snow&quot; (1978), &quot;An Englishman&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1978) and &quot;Unidentified Flying Oddball&quot; (1979).

== Personal life ==
More was married three times. His first marriage in 1940 to actress Mary Beryl Johnstone (one daughter, Susan Jane, born 1941) ended in divorce in 1946. He married Mabel Edith &quot;Bill&quot; Barkby in 1952 (one daughter, Sarah, born 1954) but left her in 1968 for Angela Douglas, an actress 26 years his junior, causing considerable estrangement from family and friends. He was married to Douglas, whom he nicknamed &quot;Shrimp&quot;, from 17 March 1968 until his death in 1982.

More wrote two autobiographies, &quot;Happy Go Lucky&quot; (1959) and &quot;More or Less&quot; (1978). In the second book, he related how he had since childhood, a recurrent dream of something akin to a huge wasp descending towards him. During the war, he had experienced a German Stuka dive-bomber descending in just such a manner. After that, he claimed never to have had that dream again. Producer Daniel M. Angel successfully sued More for libel in 1980, over comments made in his second autobiography. More subsequently recounted that the libel suit, which he said had stemmed from &quot;innocently&quot; using &quot;the wrong words to describe an event in my life,&quot; had a negative effect on his health and brought him to the verge of a nervous breakdown. 

== Illness and death ==
More and Douglas separated for several years during the 1970s, but reunited when he was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. This made it increasingly difficult for him to work, although his last role was a sizeable supporting part in a US TV adaptation of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1980). In 1980, when he was being sued by producer Danny Angel for comments in his memoirs, he told the court he was retired.

In 1981, he wrote:
Doctors and friends ask me how I feel. How can you define &quot;bloody awful?&quot; My nerves are stretched like a wire; the simplest outing becomes a huge challenge – I have to have Angela&#x27;s arm to support me most days... my balance or lack of it is probably my biggest problem. My blessings are my memories and we have a few very loyal friends who help us through the bad days... Financially all&#x27;s well. Thank goodness my wife, who holds nothing of the past over my head, is constantly at my side. Real love never dies. We share a sense of humour which at times is vital. If I have a philosophy it is that life doesn&#x27;t put everything your way. It takes a little back. I strive to remember the ups rather than the downs. I have a lot of time with my thoughts these days and sometimes they hurt so much I can hardly bear it. However, my friends always associate me with the song: &quot;When You&#x27;re Smiling...&quot; lt isn&#x27;t always easy but I&#x27;m trying to live up to it.
More died on 12 July 1982, aged 67. It is now believed that he had been suffering from multiple system atrophy (MSA), a belief due in part to the age of onset and the speed at which the condition progressed. He was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium and a plaque erected at the actors&#x27; church St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, following a memorial attended by family, friends and colleagues.

== Legacy ==
The Kenneth More Theatre, named in honour of the actor, was founded in 1975, in Ilford, east London.

A plaque commemorates More at 27 Rumbold Road, Fulham, his home at the time of his death. Another memorial plaque was installed at the Duchess Theatre in London&#x27;s West End (where More gave his acclaimed performance as Freddie Page in a production of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot;).
