<text>Watford Junction is a railway station serving the town of Watford in Hertfordshire, England. The station is on the West Coast Main Line (WCML), from and the Abbey Line, a branch line to St Albans. It is also the northern terminus of the Lioness line of the London Overground, which operates via the Watford DC line into central London.

Journeys into London take between 16 and 52 minutes, depending on the service. Trains also run to and , via the West London line. The station is a major hub for local bus services and the connecting station for buses to Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter. The station is located north of a viaduct over the Colne Valley and immediately south of Watford Tunnel.

==History==

The first railway station to open in Watford was situated on the north side of St Albans Road, approximately further up the line from the present-day station. This small, single-storey red-brick building was built in 1836–7, when the first section of the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR) was opened between London and . The station provided first and second-class waiting rooms, a departure yard, a carriage shed and engine house. The platforms were situated in a deep cutting which was accessed via a staircase.

In its 21 years of operation, it also served as a station for royalty; in the short period when the Dowager Queen Adelaide was resident at Cassiobury House (c.1846-49), this station was remodelled to provide her with a royal waiting room, and it was also reportedly used by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on a trip to visit Sir Robert Peel in November 1843, when they travelled by road from Windsor Castle to take a train from Watford to .

The old station closed when it was replaced by a new, larger station, which opened on 5 May 1858. The new &quot;Watford Junction&quot; station was located south of St Albans Road in order to accommodate the newly constructed branch line to St Albans. The junction station was rebuilt in 1909, and was extensively redeveloped in the 1980s. The Grade-II-listed Old Station House still stands at 147A St Albans Road, a rare surviving example of architecture from the beginning of the railway age; today, the building is occupied by a second-hand car dealership.

In 1862, the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway opened a route from Watford to Rickmansworth (Church Street). Now mostly closed, this route began by running south and west to a more central station on Watford&#x27;s High Street, which remains in use.

From 1846, the L&amp;BR was absorbed into the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and Watford Junction was now run by this large, ambitious company. Seeking to compete with local buses and trams, the LNWR built an additional suburban line from Euston to Watford in the early years of the 20th century, known as the Watford DC line. This veered away from the main line at Bushey to loop around Watford to pass through the High Street station. A second suburban branch line was also built from High Street west towards Croxley Green to serve new housing developments in that area. Both branches were later electrified as part of this improvement plan, on the same DC three-rail system. The Rickmansworth branch was connected to the Main Line, via two through platforms, with a junction to the north; these platforms have since been partly built over and their remaining southern sections form part of the present DC lines terminus. At one time, tube-style trains were used on the branches to counter the low voltage caused by the lack of a sub-station near Rickmansworth.

The Bakerloo line was extended to Watford Junction in 1917, giving a shared service north of Willesden Junction with the main line electric trains which served and Broad Street stations. However, since 1982 the line north of has only been served by what is now the London Overground service from Euston station; this service uses these DC lines for its all-stations local service.

Oyster card capability was extended to this station on 11 November 2007 on both the London Overground and Southern; it was extended to London Midland services on 18 November 2007. However, the station is outside London fare zones 1–9 and special fares apply.

With the electrification of the entire West London line in the 1990s, it became practical to run services from Watford Junction to Clapham Junction, allowing passengers to cross London without changing trains. Southern operated an hourly service from Milton Keynes, now starting from Watford Junction, to East Croydon with connections to Brighton and Gatwick.

There is a well-known expression, &quot;North of Watford&quot;, which is used to mean the north of England, especially a place remote from London. An alternative variant phrase, &quot;North of Watford Junction&quot;, was used with similar meaning in the past, referring to Watford Junction railway station. The expression reflects the station&#x27;s position as the last urban stop on the main railway line out of London to the north of England. In more recent years, it has been suggested that the phrase references Watford Gap services on the M1, however the original saying was in existence well before its opening in 1959.

===Motive power depot===
The LNWR built a locomotive depot at the station in 1856, which was replaced by a larger building in 1872 and was further enlarged in 1890. It was closed by British Railways in March 1965.

===Redevelopment===

In 1984, the Victorian station buildings were demolished and the station was rebuilt in a modern architectural style; there is a travel centre and a large office block above the station which is occupied by the lorry and bus manufacturing company Iveco. Some 19th-century waiting rooms survived, but were finally demolished in 1987. To enlarge the car park and provide more space, the St. Albans branch line was realigned northwards, with the original St. Albans platforms becoming a single terminating bay now mostly used by Southern services.

The station forecourt was extensively remodelled in 2013; the horseshoe-shaped taxi rank was moved to the side of the building, creating a larger pedestrian area in front of the station entrance, and the bus station enlarged. Due to problems with the road layout, buses were unable to gain access to the bus station, and there were problems with access to the relocated car park. London Northwestern Railway are considering revising the design.

Further redevelopment of the station and its surroundings is planned for the next 10 years. They may be delayed because the redevelopment of Watford Junction has been placed within the pre-qualification pool of proposed schemes by the Department for Transport.

===Accidents and incidents===

====1954 accident====
On 3 February 1954, an express passenger train became derailed in Watford Tunnel due to a broken rail. The last three carriages became divided from the train as it entered the station. One of them ended up on the platform. A passing express passenger train grazed the wreckage but only received minor damage. Fifteen people were injured.

====1975 accident====
On 23 January 1975, an express train from Manchester to Euston derailed just south of Watford Junction after striking some stillages that had fallen on to the track. It then collided with a sleeper service from Euston to Glasgow. The driver of the Manchester train was killed, and eight passengers and three railway staff injured. The stillages had fallen from a Ford company goods train that had passed the station a few minutes earlier, conveying car parts from Dagenham to Halewood. Although the wagons of the goods train were sealed on departure from Dagenham, three were found to have open doors when the train was inspected after the accident. The official enquiry ruled that the doors had been forced by thieves or vandals, probably when the train was standing at .

====1996 accident====

In August 1996, a Class 321 passenger train, operated by Network SouthEast, passed a signal at danger. An empty Class 321 coaching stock train collided with the stationary passenger train approximately 700 m south of Watford Junction.

====2014 incident====
On 26 October 2014, a Class 350 electric multiple unit on the 06:42 service from to London Euston, operated by London Midland struck the door of a lineside equipment cabinet and suffered damage to a set of doors; however, no one was killed or injured. The RAIB investigated the incident, and concluded that the lineside cabinet door had not been properly secured during maintenance work the previous night. The investigation also noted that the maintenance crew were likely suffering from fatigue due to a pattern of consistent night-shift work, regular overtime, and short-term sleep deprivation.

====2016 accident====
On 16 September 2016, Class 350 electric multiple unit 350 264 collided with a landslide, caused by heavy rain the previous night, at the entrance of the Watford Tunnel and derailed. Class 350 unit 350 233 then collided with the derailed train. Two injuries were reported, and trains were disrupted for three days.

==Future developments==
=== Watford Junction station area improvements===
There are plans to upgrade the station and its access points. The scheme includes a new multi-storey car park and a new access road to the station, connecting the A412 to Colonial Way and thus to the A4008 M1 link road.

This scheme is currently in the Pre-Qualification pool, where to achieve funding a case for selection must be submitted and if successful the Watford Station redevelopments will be moved into the Development Pool where more than 24 transport projects will compete for about £600 million.

===Croxley Rail Link===
A proposal called the Croxley Rail Link - later the Metropolitan Line Extension - would have diverted the Metropolitan line&#x27;s branch via the disused Croxley Green branch to terminate at Watford Junction. It was expected to open to passenger service in 2020, but due to funding issues, the project has been halted.

==Proposed developments==

===West London Line improvement===
The &quot;London and South East Route Utilisation Strategy&quot; document published by Network Rail in July 2011 makes several suggestions for improving services to and from Watford Junction, to link the West London line more effectively with the WCML and to &#x27;free up&#x27; platform space at with the anticipation of High Speed 2.

Assuming the ongoing increase in demand on the orbital route between Watford Junction and the West London Line, a significant increase of peak capacity services is needed, as the current service forms the only link between the Watford Junction and Kensington Olympia corridors. This proposal suggests increasing West London Line – Watford Junction/Milton Keynes Central peak service to three tph and increasing present off peak services from an hour to every 30 minutes as well as suggesting extending Southern trains from 4 car to 8 car to help ease overcrowding further.

===Crossrail===

The 2011 &quot;London &amp; South East Rail Utilisation Strategy&quot; also made recommendations for the Crossrail lines then under construction in central London to be extended northwards into Hertfordshire via Watford Junction, with Tring and Milton Keynes identified as potential termini. The report recommends the addition of a tunnel in the vicinity of a proposed station at connecting the Crossrail route to the West Coast Main line. The diversion of rail services through central London would enable a direct link from stations such as Watford Junction to West End stations such as and would alleviate congestion at Euston station; Crossrail services currently planned to terminate at due to capacity constraints would also be able to continue further east, allowing for a more efficient use of the line. This proposal has not been officially confirmed or funded, although an announcement made in August 2014 by the transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin indicated that the government was actively evaluating the possibility of extending Crossrail as far as Tring and Milton Keynes Central.

===London Euston/Watford-Aylesbury services===
The rail operator Chiltern Railways proposed in 2008 that a new east–west direct rail route from Watford Junction to could be operated via the new Croxley Rail Link and the northern section of the London to Aylesbury Line. The proposal, or a connection from Aylesbury to London Euston, has been supported by the transport advocacy group Greengauge 21. A 2006 report by Hertfordshire County Council mentioned the possibility of a link running as far as .

===Watford to St Albans Busway (Abbey Busway)===
A Draft Rail Strategy consultation published by Hertfordshire County Council in June 2015 again considered light rail proposals for the Abbey Line but also recommended that the railway track be removed and replaced with a guided busway.

==Political positions==

Capito has voted with her party 96% of the time. She is considered relatively moderate and has crossed the aisle on some votes. In 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Capito was one of the three most moderate Republican senators according to a study by &quot;DW-NOMINATE&quot;. In 2023, The Lugar Center and McCourt School of Public Policy ranked Capito in the top fifth among senators for bipartisanship. According to FiveThirtyEight, as of January 2023, Capito had voted with President Biden&#x27;s position about 56% of the time.

=== Donald Trump&#x27;s candidacy and presidency ===

In 2016, Capito raised concerns about Trump&#x27;s tone and rhetoric during his presidential campaign. After the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape emerged, Capito said he should &quot;reexamine his candidacy&quot;. But she later said she supported Trump for president. In 2020, Capito said she would be &quot;impartial&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; to both sides during Trump&#x27;s Senate trial after his second impeachment, and voted to acquit him. According to FiveThirtyEight, she had voted with the Trump administration&#x27;s position 94.9% of the time.

As of November 19, 2020, Capito had not publicly acknowledged that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, though it had been called by all major media and analysts. By November 23, she issued a statement recognizing that Biden would be the next president. By December 5, she was among only 27 congressional Republicans to acknowledge Biden as the winner of the election. Trump subsequently attacked them, calling them RINOs.

On May 28, 2021, Capito voted against creating the January 6 commission. Asked about Trump&#x27;s future role in the Republican Party, she said she partially blamed him for the &quot;insurrection&quot; and did not think he would be the Republican nominee for president in 2024. Capito eventually endorsed Trump in the 2024 election.

===Social policy===
Capito is a sponsor of the Gender Advancement in Pay (GAP) Act, saying, &quot;it should be common sense that women and men get equal pay for equal work&quot; and expressing concern about sex discrimination against women in the workplace. She is a sponsor of the Rural Access to Hospice Act to improve the quality, access, and retention of hospice facilities in rural parts of the nation. She opposes the Freedom to Vote Act which, among other reforms, would establish Election Day as a public holiday and &quot;ensure states have early voting for federal elections, overhaul how congressional districts are redrawn and impose new disclosures on donations to outside groups active in political campaigns.&quot; On social policy, the &quot;National Journal&quot; gave Capito a score of 54% conservative and 43% liberal.

==== LGBT rights ====
Capito has a mixed record on LGBT issues. The Human Rights Campaign gave her a score of 30% in the 113th Congress and 64% in the 114th Congress. She received a 0% score in the 115th Congress and a 10% in the 116th Congress.

In 2004 and 2006, Capito voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment, which intended to ban same-sex marriage in the United States. But in 2015, she said she believed marriage was a state issue. In 2007 Capito voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and against repealing the Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell policy.

In 2009, Capito voted for the 2009-2010 Defense Appropriations bill, which expanded the legal definition of a hate crime to include crimes committed because of someone&#x27;s gender identity. Also that year, she voted against legislation that defined hate crimes as including those committed because of someone&#x27;s sexual orientation. In 2013, she voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which includes provisions to assist victims regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity and prohibits funding programs that discriminate.

In 2015, Capito voted for an amendment to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act that provided support and protections for LGBT youth. In 2015, she voted to give same-sex married couples access to Social Security and veterans&#x27; benefits. In 2017, Capito disagreed with President Trump&#x27;s use of Twitter to announce a ban on transgender troops in the military, saying, &quot;we should be thankful for any American who selflessly serves our country to defend our freedoms.&quot; In 2021, she released a statement that she opposed the inclusion of trans youth in the sporting programs of their gender identity; in particular, she opposed the inclusion of trans girls in girls&#x27; sporting teams and introduced legislation to ban trans girls from participating.

In response to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, which found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Capito said, &quot;While I would have preferred that the Supreme Court leave this decision to the states, it is my hope that all West Virginians will move forward and continue to care for and respect one another.&quot; In November 2022, Capito was one of 12 Republicans voting to advance legislation, the Respect for Marriage Act, to codify same-sex marriage into federal law; referring to civil same-sex marriage as a &quot;civil partnership,&quot; Capito said that the &quot;legislation will allow those who have entered into a civil partnership since the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, to continue to have their partnerships respected for federal benefit purposes.&quot; She voted for the final passage of the Respect for Marriage Act on November 29, 2022.

==== Abortion ====
Capito had described herself as &quot;pro-choice,&quot; or pro-abortion rights, but has a mixed record on abortion. She had previously been among the few Republican senators who publicly supported &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the Supreme Court decision ruling abortion bans unconstitutional. But in 2020, she declared her support for March for Life, an anti-abortion movement, and in 2022, she reversed her position on &quot;Roe&quot;, saying she believes states should be free to ban abortion. She supports legal abortion in cases when the pregnant patient&#x27;s health is at risk and said abortions should be rare. She has mixed ratings from anti-abortion organizations opposing abortion and abortion rights organizations advocating legal abortion. In 2002, her third-largest contributor was The WISH List, an abortion rights PAC. In 2000, she received support from Republicans for Choice. She has been endorsed by West Virginians for Life, an anti-abortion PAC, the WISH List, and by Republican Majority for Choice, an abortion rights PAC.

Capito voted against federal funding for abortion and for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, but against banning family-planning funding in US aid. She previously opposed the Hyde Amendment, but now supports it. She supported federal funding for family planning in the House but voted to require parental consent for minors seeking an abortion. She opposed banning funds for mifepristone, the &quot;abortion pill&quot;. She voted for spending bills funding Planned Parenthood and against a bill to defund it, but has also voted to defund Planned Parenthood. She is against bans on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, but supports banning abortion after 20 weeks. She voted with her party in 2018 to ban federal funding for facilities that promote abortion. Capito supports other anti-abortion legislation supported by her party. In 2021, she signed a letter put forward by the Senate&#x27;s anti-abortion caucus opposing the repeal of the Hyde Amendment and opposing legislation to liberalize current federal abortion laws.

In 2017, &quot;West Virginians for Life, said [it] still supports Capito, despite the abortion rights self-identification and support for Roe v. Wade, because of Capito&#x27;s steadfast voting record restricting abortions and defunding Planned Parenthood&quot;. In 2018, Capito said she was neutral on an initiative to ban abortion in West Virginia. She supported Trump&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh; when asked about &quot;Roe&quot;, Capito said she does not think the court will overturn the ruling. &quot;Fundamentally, it&#x27;s been a precedent for a long time,&quot; she said. Capito also supported Trump&#x27;s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Barrett signed a letter calling for the end of &quot;Roe v. Wade,&quot; and supported a group that holds that life begins at fertilization. In 2020, Capito declined to sign an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to reconsider &quot;Roe&quot;. Also in 2021, she was one of just three Senate Republicans (with Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski) to decline to sign amicus briefs in the Mississippi case that seeks to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Asked about a 2022 draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, reportedly joined by Barrett, Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch, all of whom Capito voted to confirm, she responded by criticizing the leak of the draft and said, &quot;this is a draft opinion that is not binding Supreme Court precedent. &quot;Roe&quot; still remains the law of the land until the Supreme Court issues its final ruling.&quot; After the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Roe&quot; in the &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; decision, Capito said she supported the court&#x27;s decision and believed the issue should be decided at the state level. In September 2022, Capito said she was opposed to a national 15-week abortion ban proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

==== Sexual assault ====
Capito is partnering with Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand, Patty Murray, Amy Klobuchar and other bipartisan members of Congress to update the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. In August 2018, She and Senator Joe Manchin announced $899,927 for the West Virginia Foundation for Rape Information and Services through the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Office on Violence Against Women.

==== Embryonic stem-cell research ====
Capito supports embryonic stem cell research. In 2001, Capito voted for a bill to ban the cloning of human embryos. In May 2005, as a representative, Capito broke with her party, voting with a majority of Democrats, to repeal restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research funding. Capito also voted in 2006 to attempt to override President Bush&#x27;s veto of the 2005 bill. Also in 2007, Capito again voted in favor of funding stem-cell research. She also voted in favor of research using stem cells derived from donated embryos. In 2009, Capito voted for a budget bill that prohibited the creation of human embryos for research.

==== Gun rights ====
Capito was endorsed by the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and West Virginia Citizen&#x27;s Defense League which both support gun owners&#x27; rights in 2014. In 2016, she voted in favor of alerting law enforcement when a person suspected of terrorism attempts to purchase a firearm and in favor of an amendment to improve the National Instant Background Check System, but she voted against two other gun control amendments. In 2018, Capito opposed President Trump&#x27;s suggestion that teachers be armed, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t think a teacher should carry a gun in a classroom.&quot; In January 2019, she was one of 31 Republican senators to cosponsor the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill introduced by John Cornyn and Ted Cruz that would grant individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state the right to exercise this right in any other state with concealed carry laws while concurrently abiding by that state&#x27;s laws. Capito said she was open to supporting red flag laws. As of 2020, the NRA has given her a rating of 92%, for supporting their positions, and Gun Owners of America gives her a 69% rating.

==== Healthcare ====
As a representative, Capito opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act). Since then, she had voted repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In July 2017, Capito opposed repealing the ACA without a replacement proposal, and was one of three Republican senators, along with Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who blocked a bill to repeal the ACA without a replacement early in the attempted repeal process. Later that July, she voted to repeal the ACA.

Capito was one of a few Republicans who broke with their party in favor of the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program. In January 2009, she voted to expand the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as part of its reauthorization. The expanded coverage would include about four million more children in the program. In May 2008, Capito voted for the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (commonly called the new G.I. Bill), which expanded the educational benefits for military veterans who have served since September 11, 2001. During the 112th Congress, she voted for H.R. 525 to expand the ACA grant programs. In 2014, she supported repealing the Affordable Care Act.

On March 3, 2017, Capito supported preserving the ACA&#x27;s Medicaid expansion in any GOP bill to repeal it . With three other Republicans, she signed a letter opposing the House plan to repeal the ACA. She opposed the Better Care Reconciliation Act because of her opposition to an amendment to the bill as well as over opioid issues. She was one of seven Republicans who voted against repealing the ACA without a replacement.

In 2018, Capito voted for the bipartisan Opioid Crisis Response Act to address the nation&#x27;s opioid crisis. She also voted to increase Telemedicine funding in five West Virginia counties.

In January 2019, Capito cosponsored the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, a bipartisan bill that would continue federal funding of community health centers and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) beyond that year&#x27;s September 30 deadline for five years and provide both with yearly federal funding increases beginning in fiscal year 2020. In 2021, she announced support for increasing funding for virtual healthcare options, and she co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to expand seniors&#x27; access to Telehealth, with &quot;virtual [healthcare] visits.&quot; She supports extending Medicare to cover therapies to prevent diabetes.

In 2024, Capito led a bill to create an advisory council to support research, care, and services to find a cure for Parkinson’s disease.

==== Immigration ====
Capito has said that she does not support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but voted against a 2004 bill that would have forced hospitals to report undocumented immigrants; she also voted for a 2001 bill to allow some immigrants to &quot;remain in the country while pursuing residency&quot;. In 2010, she voted against the DREAM Act. In 2018, Capito said of DACA and immigration, &quot;It&#x27;s probably going to be some sort of legal status for DACA recipients that gives them the permanence of legal status and then the border security&quot;. Of her views on DACA, Capito&#x27;s office said that she &quot;could support an immigration solution that provides for increased border security to protect Americans and provides relief for those in the DACA program. She is encouraged by ongoing negotiations between the Trump Administration and members of Congress to improve immigration policy and add resources for enforcement.&quot;

In 2018, Capito voted to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, voted against the McCain-Coons proposal to offer a pathway to citizenship without funding for a border wall, against Senator Collins&#x27;s bipartisan bill to increase funding for border security and offer a pathway to citizenship, and in favor of Trump&#x27;s proposal to offer a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants while reducing legal immigration numbers and using federal funds to build a border wall. In December 2018, Capito supported a bipartisan compromise funding bill that would have allocated $1.6 billion, instead of the $5 billion Trump requested, for a border wall to avoid a government shutdown.

Capito voiced disagreement with Trump&#x27;s &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; policy that included separating children from their parents or guardians. She said, &quot;we need to keep the families together&quot;. In 2019, she supported legislation to increase funding and humanitarian aid for &quot;relief and comfort for migrants&quot; on the US southern border. She also voted in committee for a bipartisan plan with $4.6 billion in funding with &quot;$2.9 billion for the care of migrant children and $1.3 billion to improve facilities at the border&quot;.

Special interest groups for and against immigration reform have given Capito mixed ratings. NumbersUSA, which opposes illegal immigration and seeks to reduce legal immigration, gave her an 81% score and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which also opposes illegal immigration and wants to reduce legal immigration, gave her an 88% score; conversely, the Hispanic Federation and UnidosUS, which both support immigration, gave Capito a 59% rating.

==== Drug policy ====
Capito disagreed with U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions&#x27;s 2018 memo on marijuana-related prosecutions, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m going to go on the record as saying I&#x27;m against recreational marijuana, but I respect the states&#x27; rights to make that decision&quot;. She also said that she had concerns, but accepted and supported the legalization of medical marijuana. She received a 42% rating from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which supports the decriminalization of marijuana.

==== Environmental policy ====
Capito has received at lifetime rating of 17% from the League of Conservation Voters, indicating an anti-environment voting record. In 2018, she voted for a bill that would curtail the federal government&#x27;s ability to regulate fracking. She has also voted to restrict the Department of the Interior&#x27;s ability to regulate methane emissions.

In February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the aforementioned class of chemicals, Capito was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the EPA &quot;to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).&quot; In 2020, she cosponsored legislation with fellow West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin to &quot;enhance a tax credit that Congress expanded in 2018 to spur investment in carbon capture technology.&quot;

===Foreign policy===
Capito has sponsored approximately 40 bills about international trade and international finance, the most of any other legislative topic during her career. She criticized the vulnerabilities in national security policy in the wake of the 2015 San Bernardino attack and has sponsored eight bills on the military and national security. Capito was one of 47 Republican senators to sign Senator Tom Cotton&#x27;s open letter to the Iranian government in 2015. The letter, which sought to dissuade Iran from reaching an agreement with President Barack Obama on nuclear peace, was described by the White House as &quot;undercutting foreign policy&quot;.

In April 2017, Capito co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

On foreign policy, the &quot;National Journal&quot; gave her a score of 77% conservative and 15% liberal.

====International trade====
In 2005, Capito voted against the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the major trade agreement negotiated under President George W. Bush. In 2003, 2004, and 2007, she voted to approve free trade agreements with Chile, Singapore, Australia, and Peru. She supports tariffs against countries that manipulate currencies, and she sponsored a bill that would create an import fee on countries with an undervalued currency.

===Interior policy===
Capito supports the Republican Main Street Partnership&#x27;s motion to elevate the EPA to be a Cabinet-level department, which would bring more oversight to the entity.

Capito opposes legislation aimed at capping greenhouse gas emissions. In January 2010, she reportedly asked the president if he would reconsider &quot;job-killing&quot; policies like limiting greenhouse gases.

In March 2011, Capito and other members of West Virginia&#x27;s House delegation co-sponsored a campaign to allow the remains of the last American living veteran of World War I, Frank Buckles, to lie in state at the Capitol rotunda. The move, requested by Buckles&#x27;s family, had been blocked by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner. Reid and Boehner supported a special ceremony at the Arlington National Cemetery. Capito said, &quot;This is a matter close to the hearts of many West Virginians, but everyone can appreciate the desire to come together one last time to respect and remember America’s last doughboy&quot;. The campaign was unsuccessful and Buckles lay in honor at the Arlington National Cemetery.

Capito supported Trump&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. She called the decision &quot;the right decision for the American economy and workers in West Virginia and across the country.&quot; She supports regulations implemented by the EPA, based on her bipartisan legislation, to increase clean water standards.

In March 2023, Capito introduced the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act of 2023 in support of generation IV reactor technology and nuclear development in general. The ADVANCE Act was incorporated into the Fire Grants and Safety Act and signed into law in July 2024.

===Fiscal policy===
In 2016, the fiscally conservative PAC the Club for Growth gave her a 50% lifetime rating. In 2011, while in the House, Capito voted for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 2020, she said she opposed cuts to government spending, but also opposed any increases.

In December 2010, Capito voted to extend the tax cuts enacted during the administration of President George W. Bush.

Capito supports a federal prohibition on online poker. In 2006, she cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act. She also supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. In June 2003, Capito introduced the Family Fairness in Taxing Act of 2003, which would accelerate the increase to the child tax credit, increase the qualification age for children, and revise refundability criteria for the credit.

In 2001, Capito voted in favor of the Bush tax cuts. In 2002, she supported partially privatizing Social Security but opposed complete privatization. In 2006, Capito joined Democrats to vote for an increase of the minimum wage. In 2012, during her campaign for the Senate, the Senate Conservative Fund opposed her nomination because &quot;her spending record in the House is too liberal&quot;. In 2013, she voted against cutting funding for food stamps. In 2017, Capito opposed President Trump&#x27;s proposed budget, saying that it would cut &quot;too close to the bone&quot;. In 2017, she said she supported full repeal of the inheritance tax. She also voted in favor of Trump&#x27;s tax cut bill. In 2019, she came out against budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration. Capito was among a few Republicans, including Joni Ernst of Iowa and Susan Collins of Maine, to express criticism of Trump&#x27;s nominee to the Federal Reserve, Stephen Moore, because of comments he had made about women; he ultimately withdrew the nomination. In 2019, Capito announced support for paid family leave. In 2020, she opposed budget cuts due to the &quot;spending needs&quot; of states like West Virginia. On September 30, 2021, she was among 15 Senate Republicans to vote with all Democrats and both Independents for a temporary spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. On October 7, 2021, she was one of 11 Republicans voting with all members of the Democratic caucus to end a filibuster on raising the debt ceiling, but voted against the bill to raise the debt ceiling. On August 10, 2021, Capito was one of 19 Senate Republicans to vote with the Democratic caucus in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. On economic issues, the &quot;National Journal&quot; gave her a rating of 53% conservative and 47% liberal.

=== Judiciary ===

Capito opposed having a hearing for President Obama&#x27;s nominee, Merrick Garland, to the Supreme Court due to the nomination&#x27;s proximity to the 2016 presidential election. In 2017, she voted to confirm President Trump&#x27;s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. After Trump nominated a second justice, Capito announced her support for the nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, and after he was accused of sexual assault, she continued to support his nomination. But she also said she considered the allegation serious and was among a handful of Republican senators to ask for a vote to be delayed in order to hear from the accuser and from Kavanaugh. Some of her fellow alumnae from the Holton-Arms School personally delivered her a letter signed by more than a thousand alumnae of the school, saying that they believe Kavanaugh&#x27;s accuser because her allegations are &quot;all too consistent with stories we heard and lived&quot; while attending Holton-Arms.

In March 2019, Capito was one of 12 senators to cosponsor a resolution that would impose a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court to nine justices. The resolution was introduced after multiple Democratic presidential candidates expressed openness to the idea of expanding the seats on the Supreme Court.

In September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Capito supported an immediate vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s death. In March 2016, she took the opposite position when facing Obama&#x27;s nominee, saying that a justice should not be considered during a presidential election year because &quot;West Virginians and the American people should have the ability to weigh in at the ballot box&quot;. As of November 2021, Capito had a mixed voting record on Biden&#x27;s judicial nominees.

==Vice presidential speculation==
Capito was considered a possible contender for vice president on the Republican ticket with Donald Trump in 2016, and in May 2016 she was one of several senators to meet with Trump in Washington, D.C. In the end, Trump picked Indiana Governor and former U.S. Representative Mike Pence to join him on the Republican ticket.

== Electoral history ==



































== Personal life ==
Capito is married to Charles L. Capito, and they have three children: sons Charles and Moore, and daughter Shelley. Her father served over two years in prison on corruption charges. Her sister, Lucy Moore Durbin, was arrested in 1992 along with her husband for selling cocaine to an undercover officer. Capito and the Moore Capito family are members of First Presbyterian Church in Charleston, West Virginia, a congregation of the Presbyterian Church (USA).

In September 2015, &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; featured Capito in its &quot;I&#x27;m a Runner&quot; vlog, where she states she has been a distance runner for over 30 years.

<doc id="408059" wikidata="Q705976" url="?curid=408059" title="Artabanus of Persia">
<text>Artabanus of Persia (or Artabanus the Hyrcanian; ) was a Persian political figure during the Achaemenid dynasty who was reportedly Regent of Persia for a few months (465 BC – 464 BC).

Artabanus probably originated from the province of Hyrcania and reportedly served as the chief official of Xerxes I. He is considered to have served either as his vizier or as his head bodyguard.

According to Aristotle, Artabanus was responsible for the death of Crown Prince Darius. He then became afraid that Xerxes would seek revenge and proceeded to assassinate the King. On the other hand, Junianus Justinus reported that Artabanus had personal ambitions for the throne. He first secretly murdered Xerxes and then accused Darius of parricide, resulting in his execution. The order of events remains uncertain but the deaths of Xerxes and Darius did leave the throne vacant.

Artabanus&#x27; course of action is also uncertain. Some accounts have him usurping the throne for himself. Others consider him to have named young Artaxerxes I as King and to have acted as Regent and power behind the throne. This state of affairs would not last more than a few months. Artaxerxes reportedly slew him with his own sword, either in battle or by surprise. Artabanus is occasionally listed among the Kings of the Achaemenid dynasty though he was not related to them.

<text>Bekonscot Model Village and Railway is a model village built in the 1920s in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK at a scale of one inch to one foot. It portrays aspects of England mostly dating from the 1930s and contains several fictitious villages featuring replicas of notable local buildings. The model railway has almost 10 scale miles (400 m) of tracks and in 2001, a 7 1/4 in gauge railway was opened to transport visitors. Bekonscot has become both a popular tourist location and a part of English culture. It is commonly referred to as the oldest surviving model village in the UK and by 2020, had received over 14 million visitors. Authors such as Enid Blyton, Mary Norton and Will Self have been inspired by the village.
==Creation==
Bekonscot Model Village and Railway was created as a private miniature park in the 1920s by Roland Callingham and his gardener W. A. Berry. Callingham&#x27;s wife had told him to take his model railway hobby outside their house, so he purchased four acres of land in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, and built an ideal English village with a church, railway and high street, illuminated by electric lights. Everything was constructed at a scale of one inch to one foot. The railway was long and had stations including a London terminus called Maryloo (referencing real stations Marylebone and Waterloo). It was designed by Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke, who had also provided a train set made out of silver to the Maharaja of Gwalior. It was opened to the general public in 1929 and three years later it had become a popular tourist attraction. By 1933, it was opened to the public every Sunday between April and September with the railway running and every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday afternoon without the trains working. The entrance fee was donated to the Railway Benevolent Institution and the Queen&#x27;s Institute of District Nursing.

==History==

In 1934, Bekonscot was visited by the young Elizabeth II on her eighth birthday. An article published in the &quot;National Geographic&quot; in 1937 praised the &quot;flawless miniatures of wood and stone, metal, stucco, bright paint, and glass&quot;. Bekonscot, alongside Pendon Museum in Oxfordshire and Bourton-on-the-Water in Gloucestershire, inspired a trend for model villages in British seaside resort towns such as Babbacombe, Southport and Southsea. By the 1960s it was owned and run by the Bekonscot Model Railway and Charitable Association. It is commonly referred to as the oldest surviving model village in the UK, although the eccentric Charles Paget Wade constructed a village called Fladbury at his home Snowshill Manor in 1907, which has been restored by National Trust volunteers.
Bekonscot was updated with recent developments such as Concorde and office buildings until the 1990s, when it was returned to the 1930s. By 2020, it had incorporated a new town and added a replica of High and Over, a house designed by Amyas Connell in the nearby town of Amersham. The project is now composed of the fictitious villages of Bekonscot, Evenlode new town and colliery, Epwood, Greenhaily, Hanton, Southpool and Splashyng, which are linked together by the model railway. It features replicas of some notable local buildings and contains features such as an airport, a cable car, a cathedral, a castle, a cricket match, pubs, windmills and a zoo. The zoo is named Chessnade after Chessington World of Adventures and Whipsnade Zoo; shops are titled with punning names, such as the butcher Sam and Ella, the dressmaker Miss A. Stitch, the florist Dan D. Lyon and the greengrocer Chris P. Lettis. 

The model railway now has almost 10 scale miles (400 m) of tracks, with twelve stations and over 3,000 shrubs and trees. Trains run on a 1 gauge track and are powered by electricity. Visitors walk through the model village and can also look down on it from different viewing spots. In 2001, the Bekonscot Light Railway (BLR) was opened as a 7 1/4 in gauge railway which moves visitors around the village. The entire project closes over winter; smaller models are taken indoors, whilst larger buildings and the railway are refurbished on site.

==In popular culture==


Bekonscot is the oldest participant in the International Association of Miniature Parks (IMAP). By 2020, Bekonscot had received over 14 million visitors and had become part of English culture. The village frequently appears on lists of recommended family days out. It represents an idealised version of traditional English villages and its brochure states it is a &quot;little piece of history that is forever England&quot;. Enid Blyton was a Beaconsfield resident and friend of Callingham; she set her short story &quot;The Enchanted Village&quot; in Bekonscot. The &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; reported that Toyland, where her fictional character Noddy lives, was inspired by Bekonscot. In tribute to Blyton, a replica of her now demolished house Green Hedges was installed in 1997. Mary Norton was inspired by Bekonscot when she wrote &quot;The Borrowers Aloft&quot; and Will Self set his short story &quot;Scale&quot; in the model village. Bekonscot also features in the non-fiction book &quot;Dreamstreets: A Journey Through Britain&#x27;s Village Utopias&quot;. Historian Tim Dunn grew up nearby and has written the official guidebook.

<text>Holten (Dutch Low Saxon: &quot;Hooltn&quot;) is a village in the municipality of Rijssen-Holten in the Dutch province of Overijssel. Holten is located in a forested area just south of the Holterberg, a hill, and is part of the Sallandse Heuvelrug National Park. The National Park is the only area in the Netherlands in which the black grouse (in Dutch: &quot;korhoen&quot;) can be found. This grouse population is on the brink of extinction, so parts of the National Park are closed to the public during its breeding season.

==Holten Canadian War Cemetery==
Holten Canadian War Cemetery is the second-largest World War II cemetery in the Netherlands and is administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It is located in a forested area north-east of Holten railroad station, and is accessible by car or bicycle via a number of sand roads. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the cemetery on May 4, 2015, in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.

==Notable residents==
Holten is the home village of Olympic 1500m speed skating gold medalist Mark Tuitert, jazz trombonist Wolter Wierbos, professional darts player Danny Jansen and film and documentary director and Academy Award winner Bert Haanstra.

==Dialect==
As well as Standard Dutch, local inhabitants speak a variety of Dutch Low Saxon, which is considered to be part of the Sallaands sub-dialect, with a few Tweants traits that are a natural result of the village&#x27;s proximity to Twente. While in surrounding communities the use of dialect is relatively widespread, Holten has seen a decline over the past few decades.

<doc id="408067" wikidata="Q850497" url="?curid=408067" title="Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)">
<text>The Second Treaty of Brömsebro (or the Peace of Brömsebro) was signed on 13 August 1645, and ended the Torstenson War, a local conflict that began in 1643 (and was part of the larger Thirty Years&#x27; War) between Sweden and Denmark–Norway. Negotiations for the treaty began in February the same year.

==Location==
The eastern border between the then Danish province of Blekinge and the Swedish province of Småland was formed by the creek Brömsebäck. In this creek lies an islet that was connected to the Danish and Swedish riversides by bridges. On the islet was a stone that was supposed to mark the exact border between the two countries. By this stone, the delegates met to exchange greetings and, at the end of the negotiations, the signed documents. The Danish delegation stayed in Kristianopel while the Swedish side had their accommodation in Söderåkra.

==Delegations==
Sweden&#x27;s highest ranking representative was Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna. He was accompanied by, among others, Johan Skytte, who died during the negotiations and was replaced by Ture Sparre.

Corfitz Ulfeldt and Chancellor Christen Thomesen Sehested were the chief negotiators of the Danish delegation.

The French diplomat Gaspard Coignet de la Thuillerie was head mediator and observers from the Hanseatic League, Portugal, Stralsund and Mecklenburg followed the negotiations.

==Results==
The military strength of Sweden ultimately forced Denmark–Norway to give in to Swedish demands.
* Denmark–Norway ceded the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland and Härjedalen as well as the Danish Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Saaremaa (Ösel). The Norwegian regions Idre &amp; Särna were conquered by Dalecarlian peasants at the suggestion of the Swedish government. The concession of this region was not formally recognised until 1751. 
* Christian IV son, Frederick II Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Verden (1634–1645) and of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (1635–1645), had to resign, with the two prince-bishoprics being occupied by the Swedes. 
* Sweden was exempted from the Sound Dues, a toll on foreign ships passing through Danish waters into the Baltic Sea, and Hamburg was exempted from the “Elbe dues”, a toll levied until then on ships to that city by the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen.
* Sweden received the Danish province of Halland for a period of 30 years as a guarantee of these provisions.

The treaty was to be followed by the Treaty of Roskilde of 1658, which forced Denmark–Norway to further concessions.

<text>Sing Tao News Corporation Limited (Sing Tao) is a Hong Kong media company, incorporated in Bermuda. It was formerly called Global China Group Holdings Limited.

==History==
The Group, which is listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, was founded in 1996, under the name Perfect Treasure Holdings Limited and would go on to acquire and take on the name of the much older Sing Tao newspaper.

Perfect Treasure was acquired by Charles Ho and renamed to Global China Technology Group Limited in mid-2000. The following January, Global China Technology Group acquired a 51.36% majority holding in Sing Tao Holdings from private equity fund Lazard Asia and Ho became executive chairman of both Global China Technology Group and Sing Tao Holdings. In 2002, Sing Tao Holdings was fully acquired by GCT.

The company was then renamed again, from Global China Technology Group to Global China Group Holdings Limited, on 4 October 2002. At this time its business interests included the distribution of Nikon cameras and the provision of broadband services, in China, along with the newly acquired Sing Tao media stable.

===Sing Tao News Corporation===
Ho had been honorary chairman of Sing Tao Holdings since September 1999, when it was acquired by Lazard Asia after struggling under founder-family member Sally Aw.

In mid-2002 the Sing Tao subsidiary, excluding Sing Tao Media Holdings, which held the Sing Tao newspaper, and Colony Hotel, was sold on to Ming Yuan Investment Group, a private company owned by Yao Yuan.

Sing Tao Holdings became known as Shanghai Mingyuan Holdings, from October 2002. Sing Tao Media Holdings was an intermediate company for newspaper and magazine business of the former Sing Tao Holdings group. In early 2002, Sing Tao Media acquired the Hong Kong magazines &#x27;Teens&#x27; and &#x27;East Touch&#x27;, as founding titles in the magazine publishing division of the group.

The predecessors of Sing Tao Holdings as the parent company of Sing Tao group, was Sing Tao Limited (aka: Sing Tao Newspapers Limited and Sin Poh Amalgamated (H.K.) Limited). As of 2018, Sing Tao Limited still operated as a company and a subsidiary of Sing Tao News Corporation.

In 2003, Colony Hotel, which the company partially owned, was sold to the University of Toronto.

On 22 February 2005, Global China Group Holdings was renamed to Sing Tao News Corporation. In the same year Sing Tao sold the headquarters of its newspaper division in Kowloon Bay, Kowloon. The headquarters was later relocated to A Kung Ngam in Hong Kong Island. In 2017, the headquarters was relocated to Tseung Kwan O.

===Charles Ho relinquishes control===
In February 2021, Ho sold a 28 percent stake in Sing Tao News Corporation to Kwok Hiu-ting (Guo Xiaoting), vice chairwoman of mainland property management firm Kaisa Prosperity, for HK$370 million. Kwok, born 1994, who is the daughter of Kwok Ying-shing (郭英成), chairman of the mainland property firm, Kaisa Group, instantly became the majority shareholder, up from zero. Ho retained just three percent of the company.

<doc id="408072" wikidata="Q4898793" url="?curid=408072" title="Betty Crocker">
<text>Betty Crocker is a brand and fictional character used in advertising campaigns for food and recipes. The character was created by the Washburn-Crosby Company in 1921 to give a personalized response to consumer product questions. In 1954, General Mills introduced the red spoon logo with her signature, placing it on Gold Medal flour, Bisquick, and cake-mix packages. A portrait of Betty Crocker appears on printed advertisements, product packaging, and cookbooks.

The character was developed in 1921 following a unique Gold Medal Flour promotion featured in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. The ad asked consumers to complete a jigsaw puzzle and mail it to the then Washburn-Crosby Company, later General Mills, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In return, they would receive a pincushion shaped like a bag of flour. Along with 30,000 completed puzzles came several hundred letters with cooking-related questions. 

Realizing that especially housewives would want advice from a fellow woman, the company’s Advertising Department convinced its board of directors to create a personality that the women answering the letters could all use in their replies. The name Betty was selected because it was viewed as a cheery, all-American name. It was paired with the last name Crocker, in honor of William Crocker, a Washburn Crosby Company director. 

The portrait of Betty Crocker was first commissioned in 1936. It has been updated seven times since her creation, reflecting changes in fashion and hairstyles.

Described as an American cultural icon, the image of Betty Crocker has endured several generations, adapting to changing social, political, and economic currents. Apart from advertising campaigns in printed, broadcast and digital media, she received several cultural references in film, literature, music and comics.

==Creation==

Betty Crocker was created in 1921 by Washburn-Crosby and advertising executive Bruce Barton. Crocker was based on a sous-chef from Franklin College — where Barton attended school — who made the delicious, if somewhat dry, baked goods for the cafeteria. Under Marjorie Husted&#x27;s supervision, the image of Betty Crocker became the &quot;Zeus&quot; of General Mills. In 1928, Washburn Crosby merged with other milling companies to form General Mills.

In 1924, Crocker acquired a voice with the debut of &quot;The Betty Crocker Cooking School of the Air&quot; on one station in Minneapolis. It was the country&#x27;s first radio cooking program. Blanche Ingersoll followed by Husted was selected to portray Betty Crocker. The show proved popular and eventually was carried nationally on NBC Radio, with Agnes White Tizard as Betty. Over the next three decades, the women would anonymously portray Betty Crocker on the air and at cooking schools.

In 1929, Betty Crocker coupons were introduced. Inserted in bags of flour, they could be used to reduce the cost of Oneida Limited flatware. By 1932, this scheme had become so popular that General Mills began to offer an entire set of flatware; the pattern was called &quot;Friendship&quot; (later renamed &quot;Medality&quot;). In 1937, the coupons were printed on the outside of packages, copy on which told purchasers to &quot;save and redeem for huge savings on fine kitchen and home accessories in our catalog&quot;.

The character made its packaging debut in 1937, appearing on &quot;Softasilk&quot; cake flour. The name appeared in various Gold Medal products but its first brand name appearance came in 1941 on soup mixes.

== Cookbooks ==
From 1930, General Mills issued softbound recipe books, including, in 1933, &quot;Betty Crocker&#x27;s 101 Delicious Bisquick Creations, as Made and Served by Well-Known Gracious Hostesses, Famous Chefs, Distinguished Epicures and Smart Luminaries of Movieland.&quot;

The &quot;Betty Crocker Cook Book of All-Purpose Baking&quot; was published as an aid to wartime considerations in cooking.

In 1950, the first hardcover recipe cookbook was published, entitled &quot;Betty Crocker Picture Cookbook&quot;. It was written by nutritionist Agnes White Tizard.

In 2005, the 10th edition of the Betty Crocker cookbook was published, as well as a Spanish/English bilingual book that collects some of the more common recipes for Spanish-speaking readers looking to cook American-style food. An 11th edition, in ring-binder format, appeared in 2011. At least 17 other Betty Crocker recipe collections were also in print in 2015.

==Media==
&quot;Betty Crocker&quot; programs first appeared on radio on local stations in 1924. The first network &quot;Betty Crocker&quot; broadcast was on NBC in 1926. The show remained on network radio until 1953; most of the time the program was on NBC or CBS, but it was on ABC from 1947 to 1953.

Betty Crocker was portrayed by several actresses, including Marjorie Husted on radio for twenty years, and Adelaide Hawley Cumming on television between 1949 and 1964.

In 1949, the actress Adelaide Hawley Cumming became Betty Crocker for many years. She appeared for several years on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;, and even had her TV show, &quot;Betty Crocker Star Matinee&quot;. She also appeared in the CBS network&#x27;s first color commercial, in which she baked a &quot;mystery fruit cake&quot;. Hawley continued to portray Betty Crocker until 1964.

A portrait of Betty Crocker was first commissioned in 1936, a &quot;motherly image&quot; that &quot;blended the features of several Home Service Department members&quot; that was painted by Neysa McMein. It subtly changed over the years, but always accommodated General Mills&#x27; cultural perception of the American homemaker — knowledgeable and caring. The 1996 portrait of Betty Crocker, according to General Mills, was partially inspired by a &quot;computerized composite&quot; of &quot;75 women of diverse backgrounds and ages.&quot; These portraits were always painted, with no real person ever having posed as a model.

In 1945, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named Betty Crocker the second most popular woman in America; Eleanor Roosevelt was named first. In the same year, &quot;Fortune&quot; &quot;outed&quot; Betty Crocker as a fictitious creation, calling her a &quot;fake&quot; and a &quot;fraud.&quot;

==Legacy==

The Minneapolis suburb of Golden Valley, Minnesota, where General Mills is headquartered, has a street named Betty Crocker Drive.

There are several Betty Crocker–branded products, including plastic food containers and measuring cups, and a line of small appliances such as popcorn poppers and sandwich makers.

In 2006, the Betty Crocker catalog operation went out of business with all of its inventory on sale. Points were redeemable until December 15, 2006. Afterward, unused points were available to be converted into discounts for a small period thereafter on a short-lived website.

<doc id="408076" wikidata="Q7822890" url="?curid=408076" title="Tony Martin (farmer)">
<text>Anthony Edward Martin (16 December 1944 – 2 February 2025) was an English farmer who shot a burglar dead in his home on 20 August 1999. There was sympathy for Martin from people who supported the right to defend their own homes, but prosecutors cast doubt on his evidence and pointed out that he did not have a valid firearms certificate. He was convicted of murder, which was later reduced to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility, and served three years in prison after being denied parole.

==Early life==
Martin was born in Wisbech on 16 December 1944. Part of a prosperous farming family, he attended private schools in Norfolk and Oxfordshire. At school, although a successful sportsman, he was not academically gifted. Aged 17, he left school and started travelling, working on Australian farms and as a steward on ocean liners. He also worked on Scottish oil rigs, but eventually returned the family farm to run a piggery. In 1979 he inherited Bleak House, a Victorian property near Emneth Hungate, from an aunt and uncle.

==Burglary and shooting==
Martin lived alone at his farmhouse, Bleak House, in Emneth Hungate. He claimed that he had been burgled 10 times over the years, losing £6,000 worth of furniture, though police stated they were unsure whether all of the incidents actually occurred. He also complained about police inaction over the burglaries and claimed that multiple items and furniture were stolen, including dinnerware and a grandfather clock. Martin had equipped himself with an illegally held pump-action Winchester Model 1300 12-bore shotgun, which he claimed to have found.

Changes in legislation in 1988, resulting from the Hungerford massacre, had changed the licensing treatment of semiautomatic and pump-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of more than two to equate to that of a firearm, requiring a valid firearms certificate. Martin had his shotgun certificate revoked in 1994 after he found a man stealing apples in his orchard and shot a hole in the back of his vehicle.

29-year-old Brendon Fearon and 16-year-old Fred Barras, burglars from Newark-on-Trent, broke into Martin&#x27;s house on the evening of 20 August 1999. Shooting downwards in the dark with his shotgun loaded with birdshot, Martin shot three times towards the intruders, once when they were in the stairwell and twice more when they were trying to flee through the window of an adjacent ground floor room. Barras was hit in the back and both sustained gunshot injuries to their legs. Both escaped through the window, but Barras died at the scene. Martin claimed that he opened fire after being woken when the intruders smashed a window. The prosecution accused him of lying in wait for the burglars and opening fire without warning from close range, in retribution for previous break-ins at his home.

On 10 January 2000, Fearon and 33-year-old Darren Bark (who had acted as the getaway driver), also from Newark-on-Trent, admitted to conspiring to burgle Martin&#x27;s farmhouse. Fearon was sentenced to three years in prison, and Bark to two and a half years (with an additional 12 months arising from previous offences). Fearon was released on 10 August 2001. Barras had already been convicted of a total of 29 offences by the time of his death at the age of 16, including assault, seven convictions for theft and six for fraud. He had been sentenced to two months in a young offenders&#x27; institution for assaulting a police officer, theft and being drunk and disorderly. On the night he was killed, Barras had just been released on bail after being accused of stealing garden furniture. His grandmother, Mary Dolan, said: &quot;It&#x27;s not fair that the farmer has got all the money and he is the one that took Fred away.&quot;

==Murder trial==
On 23 August 1999, Martin was charged with the murder of Barras, the attempted murder of Fearon, &quot;wounding with intent to cause injury&quot; to Fearon and &quot;possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life&quot;. Martin did not hold a valid shotgun certificate, let alone the more restrictive firearms certificate he would have needed to possess the Winchester pump-action shotgun that held a maximum of five rounds.

English law at the time permitted a person to kill another in self-defence only if the person defending themself uses no more than &quot;reasonable force&quot;; it is the responsibility of the jury to determine whether or not an unreasonable amount of force was used. The jury at the trial were told that they had the option of returning a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder, if they thought that Martin &quot;did not intend to kill or cause serious bodily harm&quot;. However, the jurors found Martin guilty of murder by a 10 to 2 majority.

Martin was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommended minimum term to serve of nine years, soon afterwards reduced to eight years by the Lord Chief Justice.

==Appeal==
Martin was told he would have to sell his farm to pay for an appeal against his convictions. He did not qualify for legal aid because he owned his house and hundreds of acres of land attached to it.

Martin&#x27;s appeal against his convictions and sentence was first considered in October 2001 by three senior judges headed by Lord Woolf LCJ. Submissions by the defence that Martin had fired in his own defence were rejected by the appeal court. On this occasion, the defence also submitted evidence that Martin was diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder exacerbated by depression and that his paranoia was specifically directed at anyone intruding into his home; he was also diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. This submission was accepted by the Court of Appeal and, on the grounds of diminished responsibility, Martin&#x27;s murder conviction was replaced by manslaughter carrying a five-year sentence, and his ten-year sentence for wounding Fearon was reduced to three years. These sentences were to run concurrently. Martin was refused permission to appeal the new sentence to the House of Lords.

==Parole applications and release==
Martin was imprisoned at Highpoint Prison at Stradishall in Suffolk following his conviction. When he became eligible for parole and early release in January 2003, the parole board rejected his application without stating a reason. In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, parole board chairman Sir David Hatch described Martin as &quot;a very dangerous man&quot; who might still believe his action had been right.

Martin challenged the decision in the High Court, where the parole board&#x27;s decision was upheld. Probation officers on Martin&#x27;s cases said there was an &quot;unacceptable risk&quot; that Martin might again react with excessive force if other would-be burglars intruded on his Norfolk farm. On 28 July 2003, Martin was released after serving three years of his five-year sentence, the maximum period for which he could be held following good behaviour.

==Later life==
===Compensation claim===
In 2003, Fearon received an estimated £5,000 of legal aid to sue Martin for loss of earnings due to the injuries he had sustained. However, the case was thrown into doubt when photographs were published in &quot;The Sun&quot;, showing him &quot;cycling and climbing with little apparent difficulty&quot; suggesting that Fearon&#x27;s injuries were not as serious as had been claimed. While the case was pending, Fearon was recalled to jail after being charged with the theft of a vehicle while on probation following a conviction for dealing heroin. Fearon later dropped the case when Martin agreed to drop a counterclaim.

Nick Makin, Martin&#x27;s solicitor, said: &quot;It is appalling that the family of someone who has a criminal record for burglary and assault should attempt to claim any damages of criminal injury when he was shot while burgling the dwelling of an innocent person ... It is also appalling that they may get legal aid while his victim is in prison and patently unable to work and equally cannot get legal aid ... There is something wrong and perverse with our legal system that it permits this.&quot;

===Bounties and political activity===
The BBC reported in 2003 that Fearon&#x27;s supporters put a bounty on Martin&#x27;s head of several tens of thousands of pounds. In July, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that a cousin of Barras had said that a £60,000 bounty had been put on Martin&#x27;s head. In October, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; paid Martin £125,000 for an exclusive interview on his release from prison. After investigation, the Press Complaints Commission ruled that the payment was justified and in the public interest because Martin &quot;had a unique insight into an issue of great public concern&quot;.

Following his release, Martin made public appearances as a supporter of the right-wing populist UK Independence Party and was the guest of honour at the Annual Dinner hosted at Simpson&#x27;s-in-the-Strand by the far-right organisation Traditional Britain Group in November 2003. He also attended meetings of the fascist and white supremacist group National Front in Norfolk, and later went on to endorse the far-right and fascist British National Party. One of Martin&#x27;s uncles by marriage, Andrew Fountaine, was a founding member of the National Front.

==Illness and death==
Martin suffered a stroke in December 2024. He died at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King&#x27;s Lynn on 2 February 2025, aged 80. Initially, BBC News incorrectly reported that he had died at Wisbech Hospital.

<text>Steenwijk (; or ), datedly known in English as Stenwick, is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland. It is the largest town of the municipality.

Steenwijk received city rights in 1327. In the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648) it was conquered by the Spaniards in 1581, but regained by the Dutch in 1592.

Steenwijk was a separate municipality until 2001, when it merged with Brederwiede and IJsselham. The new municipality was first named &quot;Steenwijk&quot;, but was renamed in 2003 to &quot;Steenwijkerland&quot;.

==Transport==
Steenwijk railway station is located on the Arnhem–Leeuwarden railway, with train services operated by Nederlandse Spoorwegen.

<doc id="408092" wikidata="Q33209" url="?curid=408092" title="Mary Celeste">
<text>Mary Celeste (; often erroneously referred to as Marie Celeste) was a Canadian-built, American-registered merchant brigantine that was discovered adrift and deserted in the Atlantic Ocean off the Azores on December 4, 1872. The Canadian brigantine found her in a dishevelled but seaworthy condition under partial sail and with her lifeboat missing. The last entry in her log was dated ten days earlier. She had left New York City for Genoa on November 7 and was still amply provisioned when found. Her cargo of alcohol was intact, and the captain&#x27;s and crew&#x27;s personal belongings were undisturbed. None of those who had been on board were ever seen or heard from again.

&quot;Mary Celeste&quot; was built in Spencer&#x27;s Island, Nova Scotia, and launched under British registration as &quot;Amazon&quot; in 1861. She was transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868, when she acquired her new name. Thereafter she sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage. At the salvage hearings in Gibraltar following her recovery, the court&#x27;s officers considered various possibilities of foul play, including mutiny by &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;″s crew, piracy by the &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; crew or others, and conspiracy to carry out insurance or salvage fraud. No convincing evidence supported these theories, but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low salvage award.

The inconclusive nature of the hearings fostered continued speculation as to what had happened to the ship&#x27;s occupants, and the story has repeatedly been complicated by false detail and fantasy. Hypotheses that have been advanced include the effects on the crew of alcohol fumes rising from the cargo, submarine earthquakes, waterspouts, attack by a giant squid, and paranormal intervention.

After the Gibraltar hearings, &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; continued in service under new owners. In 1885, her captain deliberately wrecked her off the coast of Haiti as part of an attempted insurance fraud. The story of her 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized many times in documentaries, novels, plays, and films, and the name of the ship has become a byword for unexplained desertion. In 1884, Arthur Conan Doyle wrote &quot;J. Habakuk Jephson&#x27;s Statement&quot;, a short story based on the mystery, but spelled the vessel&#x27;s name as &quot;Marie Celeste&quot;. The story&#x27;s popularity led to the spelling becoming more common than the original in everyday use.

==Early history==

The keel of the future &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; was laid in late 1860 at the shipyard of Joshua Dewis in the village of Spencer&#x27;s Island, on the shores of the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. The ship was constructed of locally felled timber, with two masts, and was rigged as a brigantine; she was carvel-built, the hull planking flush rather than overlapping. She was launched on May 18, 1861, given the name &quot;Amazon&quot;, and registered at nearby Parrsboro on June 10, 1861. Her registration documents described her as in length, broad, with a depth of , and of 198.42 gross tonnage. She was owned by a local consortium of nine people, headed by Dewis; among the co-owners was Robert McLellan, the ship&#x27;s first captain.

For her maiden voyage in June 1861, &quot;Amazon&quot; sailed to Five Islands, Nova Scotia to take on a cargo of timber for passage across the Atlantic to London. After supervising the ship&#x27;s loading, Captain McLellan fell ill; his condition worsened. The &quot;Amazon&quot; returned to Spencer&#x27;s Island where McLellan died on June 19. John Nutting Parker took over as captain, and resumed the voyage to London, in the course of which &quot;Amazon&quot; encountered further misadventures. She collided with fishing equipment in the narrows off Eastport, Maine, and after leaving London ran into and sank a brig in the English Channel.

Parker remained in command for two years, during which &quot;Amazon&quot; worked mainly in the West Indies trade. She crossed the Atlantic to France in November 1861, and in Marseille was the subject of a painting, possibly by Honoré de Pellegrin, a well-known maritime artist of the Marseilles School. In 1863, Parker was succeeded by William Thompson, who remained in command until 1867. These were quiet years; &quot;Amazon&quot;″s mate later recalled that, &quot;We went to the West Indies, England and the Mediterranean—what we call the foreign trade. Not a thing unusual happened.&quot; In October 1867, at Cape Breton Island, &quot;Amazon&quot; was driven ashore in a storm, and was so badly damaged that her owners abandoned her as a wreck. On October 15, she was acquired as a derelict by Alexander McBean, of Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.

===Ownership reassignment and name change===
Within a month, McBean sold the wreck to a local businessman, who in November 1868, sold it to Richard W. Haines, an American mariner from New York. Haines paid US$1,750 for the wreck, and then spent $8,825 restoring it. He made himself her captain, and, in December 1868, registered her with the Collector of the Port of New York as an American vessel, under a new name, &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;.

In October 1869, the ship was seized by Haines&#x27;s creditors, and sold to a New York consortium headed by James H. Winchester. During the next three years, the composition of this consortium changed several times, although Winchester retained at least a half-share throughout. No record of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;″s trading activities during this period have been found. Early in 1872, the ship underwent a major refit, costing $10,000, which enlarged her considerably. Her length was increased to , her breadth to and her depth to . Among the structural changes, a second deck was added; an inspector&#x27;s report refers to extensions to the poop deck, new transoms and the replacement of many timbers. The work increased the ship&#x27;s tonnage to 282.28. On October 29, 1872, the consortium was made up of Winchester with six shares and two minor investors with one share apiece, the remaining four of twelve shares being held by the ship&#x27;s new captain, Benjamin Spooner Briggs.

===Captain Briggs and crew===
Benjamin Briggs was born in Wareham, Massachusetts, on April 24, 1835, one of five sons of sea captain Nathan Briggs. All but one of the sons went to sea, two becoming captains. Benjamin was an observant Christian who read the Bible regularly and often bore witness to his faith at prayer meetings. In 1862, he married his cousin Sarah Elizabeth Cobb, and enjoyed a Mediterranean honeymoon on board his schooner &quot;Forest King&quot;. Two children were born: Arthur in September 1865, and Sophia Matilda in October 1870.

By the time of Sophia&#x27;s birth, Briggs had achieved a high standing within his profession. He considered retiring from the sea to go into business with his seafaring brother Oliver, who had also grown tired of the wandering life. They did not proceed with this project, but each invested his savings in a share of a ship: Oliver invested in &quot;Julia A. Hallock&quot;, and Benjamin in &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;. In October 1872, Benjamin took command of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; for her first voyage following her extensive New York refit, which was to take her to Genoa in Italy. He arranged for his wife and infant daughter to accompany him, while his school-aged son was left at home in the care of his grandmother.

Briggs chose the crew for this voyage with care. First mate Albert G. Richardson was married to a niece of Winchester and had sailed under Briggs before. Second mate Andrew Gilling, aged about 25, was born in New York, and was of Danish extraction. The steward, newly married Edward William Head, was signed on with a personal recommendation from Winchester. The four general seamen were Germans from the Frisian Islands: the brothers Volkert and Boz Lorenzen, Arian Martens, and Gottlieb Goudschaal. A later testimonial described them as &quot;peaceable and first-class sailors.&quot; In a letter to his mother shortly before the voyage, Briggs declared himself eminently satisfied with ship and crew. Sarah Briggs informed her mother that the crew appeared to be quietly capable &quot;... if they continue as they have begun&quot;.

==Abandonment==
===New York===

On October 20, 1872, Briggs arrived at Pier 50 on the East River in New York City to supervise the loading of the ship&#x27;s cargo of 1,701 barrels of alcohol; his wife and infant daughter joined him a week later. On Sunday, November 3, Briggs wrote to his mother to say that he intended to leave on Tuesday, adding that &quot;our vessel is in beautiful trim and I hope we shall have a fine passage.&quot;

On the morning of Tuesday, November 5, &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; left Pier 50 with Briggs, his wife and daughter, and seven crew members, and moved into New York Harbor. The weather was uncertain, and Briggs decided to wait for better conditions. He anchored the ship just off Staten Island, where Sarah used the delay to send a final letter to her mother-in-law. &quot;Tell Arthur,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I make great dependence on the letters I shall get from him, and will try to remember anything that happens on the voyage which he would be pleased to hear.&quot; The weather eased two days later, and &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; left the harbor and entered the Atlantic.

While &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; prepared to sail, the Canadian brigantine lay nearby in Hoboken, New Jersey, awaiting a cargo of petroleum destined for Genoa via Gibraltar. Captain David Morehouse and first mate Oliver Deveau were Nova Scotians, both highly experienced and respected seamen. Captains Briggs and Morehouse shared common interests, and some writers think it likely that they knew each other, if only casually. Some accounts assert that they were close friends who dined together on the evening before &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;″s departure, but the evidence for this is limited to a recollection by Morehouse&#x27;s widow 50 years after the event. &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; departed for Gibraltar on November 15, following the same general route eight days after &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;.

===Derelict===

&quot;Dei Gratia&quot; had reached a position of , midway between the Azores and the coast of Portugal at about 1 p.m. on Wednesday, December 4, 1872, land time (Thursday, December 5, sea time). Captain Morehouse came on deck, and the helmsman reported a vessel heading unsteadily towards &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; at a distance of about . The ship&#x27;s erratic movements and the odd set of her sails led Morehouse to suspect that something was wrong. As the vessel drew close, he could see nobody on deck, and he received no reply to his signals, so he sent Deveau and second mate John Wright in a ship&#x27;s boat to investigate. The pair established that this was the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; by the name on her stern; they then climbed aboard and found the ship deserted. The sails were partly set and in a poor condition, some missing altogether, and much of the rigging was damaged, with ropes hanging loosely over the sides. The main hatch cover was secure, but the fore and lazarette hatches were open, their covers beside them on the deck. The ship&#x27;s single lifeboat was a small yawl that had apparently been stowed across the main hatch, but it was missing, while the binnacle housing the ship&#x27;s compass had shifted from its place and its glass cover was broken. There was about of water in the hold, a significant but not alarming amount for a ship of this size. A makeshift sounding rod (a device for measuring the amount of water in the hold) was found abandoned on the deck.

They found the ship&#x27;s daily log in the mate&#x27;s cabin, and its final entry was dated at 8 a.m. on November 25, nine days earlier. It recorded &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;″s position then as off Santa Maria Island in the Azores, nearly from the point where &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; encountered her. Deveau saw that the cabin interiors were wet and untidy from water that had entered through doorways and skylights, but were otherwise in reasonable order. He found personal items scattered about Briggs&#x27; cabin, including a sheathed sword under the bed, but most of the ship&#x27;s papers were missing along with the captain&#x27;s navigational instruments. Galley equipment was neatly stowed away; there was no food prepared or under preparation, but there were ample provisions in the stores. There were no obvious signs of fire or violence; the evidence indicated an orderly departure from the ship by means of the missing lifeboat.

Deveau returned to report these findings to Morehouse, who decided to bring the derelict into Gibraltar away. Under maritime law, a salvor could expect a substantial share of the combined value of rescued vessel and cargo, the exact award depending on the degree of danger inherent in the salvaging. Morehouse divided &quot;Dei Gratia&quot;″s crew of eight between the two vessels, sending Deveau and two experienced seamen to &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; while he and four others remained on &quot;Dei Gratia&quot;. The weather was relatively calm for most of the way to Gibraltar, but each ship was seriously undercrewed and progress was slow. &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; reached Gibraltar on December 12; &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; had encountered fog and arrived on the following morning. She was immediately impounded by the vice admiralty court to prepare for salvage hearings. Deveau wrote to his wife that the ordeal of bringing the ship in was such that &quot;I can hardly tell what I am made of, but I do not care so long as I got in safe. I shall be well paid for the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;.&quot;

==Gibraltar salvage hearings==

The salvage court hearings began in Gibraltar on December 17, 1872, under Sir James Cochrane, the chief justice of Gibraltar. The hearing was conducted by Frederick Solly-Flood, Attorney General of Gibraltar, who was also Advocate-General and Proctor for the Queen in Her Office of Admiralty. Flood was described by a historian of the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; affair as a man &quot;whose arrogance and pomposity were inversely proportional to his IQ&quot;, and as &quot;... the sort of man who, once he had made up his mind about something, couldn&#x27;t be shifted&quot;. The testimonies of Deveau and Wright convinced Flood unalterably that a crime had been committed, a belief picked up by the New York &quot;Shipping and Commercial List&quot; on December 21: &quot;The inference is that there has been foul play somewhere, and that alcohol is at the bottom of it.&quot;

On December 23, Flood ordered an examination of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, which was carried out by John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts on each side of the bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces of blood on the captain&#x27;s sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a vial of sewing machine oil found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the vial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunato&#x27;s report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin&#x27;s opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ship&#x27;s rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood&#x27;s suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol and murdered the Briggs family and the ship&#x27;s officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something, specifically that &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; could have traveled so far while uncrewed.

James Winchester arrived in Gibraltar on January 15, to enquire when &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; might be released to deliver her cargo. Flood demanded a surety of $15,000, money Winchester did not have. Winchester became aware that Flood thought Winchester might have deliberately engaged a crew that would kill Briggs and his officers as part of some conspiracy. On January 29, during a series of sharp exchanges with Flood, Winchester testified to Briggs&#x27;s high character, and insisted that Briggs would not have abandoned the ship except in extremity. Flood&#x27;s theories of mutiny and murder received significant setbacks when scientific analysis of the stains found on the sword and elsewhere on the ship showed that they were not blood. A second blow to Flood followed in a report commissioned by Horatio Sprague, the American consul in Gibraltar, from Captain Shufeldt of the US Navy. In Shufeldt&#x27;s view, the marks on the bow were not man-made, but came from the natural actions of the sea on the ship&#x27;s timbers.

With nothing concrete to support his suspicions, Flood reluctantly released &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; from the court&#x27;s jurisdiction on February 25. Two weeks later, with a locally raised crew headed by Captain George Blatchford from Massachusetts, she left Gibraltar for Genoa. The question of the salvage payment was decided on April 8, when Cochrane announced the award: £1,700, or about one-fifth of the total value of ship and cargo. This was far lower than the general expectation—one authority thought that the award should have been twice or even three times that amount, given the level of hazard in bringing the derelict into port. Cochrane&#x27;s final words were harshly critical of Morehouse for his decision, earlier in the hearing, to send &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; under Deveau to deliver her cargo of petroleum—although Morehouse had remained in Gibraltar at the disposal of the court. In his 2005 book, &quot;Ghost Ship: The Mysterious True Story of the Mary Celeste and Her Missing Crew,&quot; writer Brian Hicks said Cochrane&#x27;s tone carried an implication of wrongdoing which ensured that Morehouse and his crew &quot;...would be under suspicion in the court of public opinion forever.&quot;

==Proposed explanations==

===Foul play===
The evidence in Gibraltar failed to support Flood&#x27;s theories of murder and conspiracy, yet suspicion of foul play lingered. Flood, and some newspaper reports, briefly suspected insurance fraud on the part of Winchester on the basis that &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; had been heavily overinsured. Winchester was able to refute these allegations, and no inquiry was instituted by the insurance companies that had issued the policies. In 1931, an article in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; suggested that Morehouse could have lain in wait for &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, then lured Briggs and his crew aboard &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; and killed them there. Paul Begg argues that this theory ignores the fact that &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; was the slower ship; she left New York eight days after &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; departed and would not have caught &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; before she reached Gibraltar.

Another theory posits that Briggs and Morehouse were partners in a conspiracy to share the salvage proceeds, although no evidence exists of a friendship between the two captains. Hicks comments that &quot;if Morehouse and Briggs had been planning such a scam, they would not have devised such an attention-drawing mystery.&quot; He also asks why Briggs abandoned his son Arthur if he had intended to disappear permanently.

Although Riffian pirates were active off the coast of Morocco in the 1870s, Charles Edey Fay observes that pirates would have looted the ship, but the personal possessions, some of significant value, of the captain and crew were left undisturbed. In 1925, historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs slaughtered all on board and then killed himself in a fit of religious mania. Lockhart later spoke to Briggs&#x27;s descendants, and he apologized and withdrew this theory in a later edition of his book.

===Lifeboat===
Briggs&#x27;s cousin Oliver Cobb later suggested that the transfer of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure. He speculated from Deveau&#x27;s report on the state of the rigging and ropes that the ship&#x27;s main halliard may have been used to attach the yawl to the ship, enabling the company to return to &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; when the danger had passed. However, &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; would have sailed away empty if the line had parted, leaving the yawl adrift with its occupants. Begg notes that it would be illogical to attach the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was about to explode or sink. Macdonald Hastings argues that Briggs was an experienced captain who would not have led a panicked abandonment, writing: &quot;If the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; had blown her timbers, she would still have been a better bet for survival than the ship&#x27;s boat.&quot; According to Hastings, if Briggs had relied on the ship&#x27;s boat for survival rather than on &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, he would have &quot;behaved like a fool; worse, a frightened one.&quot;

Arthur N. Putman, a New York insurance appraiser, was a leading investigator in sea mysteries in the early 20th century and wrote a similar lifeboat theory stressing that only a single lifeboat was missing from the vessel. He discovered that the boat&#x27;s rope was cut, not untied, which indicated that the abandonment of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; was performed quickly. The ship&#x27;s log contained several mentions of ominous rumbling and small explosions from the hold, although cargos of alcohol naturally emit explosive gas and such sounds are commonly heard. He supposes that there had been a more intense explosion and, in response, a sailor ventured below deck with an open flame or lit cigar that ignited the fumes, causing an explosion violent enough to dislodge the top of the hatch, which had been found in an unusual position. Putman also postulated that in a panicked terror the captain, his family and the crew boarded the lone lifeboat, cut the rope and abandoned &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;.

===Natural phenomena===

Commentators generally agree that some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen to cause the entire crew to abandon a sound and seaworthy ship with ample provisions. Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a false sounding because of a malfunction, perhaps of the pumps, that created a false impression that the vessel was rapidly accumulating water. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to overestimate the amount of water on &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; and believe that she was in danger of sinking.

Other explanations include the possible appearance of a displaced iceberg, the fear of running aground while becalmed and a sudden submarine earthquake. Hydrographical evidence suggests that an iceberg drifting so far south was improbable and other ships would have seen it. Begg gives more consideration to a theory that &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; began drifting towards the Dollabarat reef off Santa Maria Island when she was becalmed. The theory supposes that Briggs feared that his ship would run aground and launched the yawl in the hope of reaching land. The wind could then have lifted and blown &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; away from the reef while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been becalmed, all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet it was found with many of its sails furled.

An earthquake on the seabed could have caused sufficient turbulence on the surface to damage parts of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;″s cargo, thus releasing noxious fumes. Rising fears of an imminent explosion could have led Briggs to order the ship&#x27;s abandonment; the displaced hatches suggest that an inspection, or an attempted airing, had taken place. The &quot;New York World&quot; of January 24, 1886 drew attention to a case in which a vessel carrying alcohol had exploded. The same journal&#x27;s issue of February 9, 1913 cited a seepage of alcohol through a few porous barrels as the source of gases that may have caused or threatened an explosion in &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;″s hold. Briggs&#x27;s cousin Oliver Cobb was a strong proponent of this theory, in which a sufficiently alarming scenario—rumblings from the hold, the smell of escaping fumes and possibly an explosion—could have caused Briggs to have ordered the evacuation of the ship. In his haste to leave the ship before it exploded, Briggs may have failed to properly secure the yawl to the tow line. A sudden breeze could have blown the ship away from the occupants of the yawl, leaving them to succumb to the elements. The lack of damage from an explosion and the generally sound state of the cargo upon discovery tend to weaken this case.

In 2006, an experiment was performed for Channel Five television by chemist Andrea Sella of University College, London, and the results helped to revive the explosion theory. Sella built a model of the hold, with paper cartons representing the barrels. Using butane gas, he created an explosion that caused a considerable blast and ball of flame, but contrary to expectation, there was no fire damage within the replica hold. He said: &quot;What we created was a pressure-wave type of explosion. There was a spectacular wave of flame but, behind it, was relatively cool air. No soot was left behind and there was no burning or scorching.&quot;

==Myths and false histories==
Fact and fiction became intertwined in the decades that followed. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; retold the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; story in June 1883 with invented detail. &quot;Every sail was set, the tiller was lashed fast, not a rope was out of place. ... The fire was burning in the galley. The dinner was standing untasted and scarcely cold … the log written up to the hour of her discovery.&quot; The November 1906 &quot;Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine&quot; reported that &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; drifted off the Cape Verde Islands, some south of the actual location. Among many inaccuracies, the first mate was &quot;a man named Briggs,&quot; and there were live chickens on board.

The most influential retelling, according to many commentators, was a story in the January 1884 issue of the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; which ensured that the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; affair would never be forgotten. This was an early work of Arthur Conan Doyle, a 25 year-old ship&#x27;s surgeon at the time. Doyle&#x27;s story &quot;J. Habakuk Jephson&#x27;s Statement&quot; did not adhere to the facts. He renamed the ship &quot;Marie Celeste&quot;, the captain&#x27;s name was J. W. Tibbs, the fatal voyage took place in 1873, and it was from Boston to Lisbon. The vessel carried passengers, among them the titular Jephson. In the story, a fanatic named Septimius Goring with a hatred of the white race has suborned members of the crew to murder Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa. The rest of the ship&#x27;s company is killed, save for Jephson who is spared because he possesses a magical charm that is venerated by Goring and his accomplices. Doyle had not expected his story to be taken seriously, but Sprague was still serving as the U.S. consul in Gibraltar and was sufficiently intrigued to inquire if any part of the story might be true.

&quot;Chambers&#x27;s Journal&quot; of September 17, 1904, suggests that the entire complement of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; was plucked off one by one by a giant octopus or squid. According to the Natural History Museum, giant squid (&quot;Architeuthis dux&quot;) can reach in length and have been known to attack ships. Begg remarks that such a creature could conceivably have picked off a crew member, but it could hardly have taken the yawl and the captain&#x27;s navigation instruments.

In 1913, &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; provided an alleged survivor&#x27;s account from one Abel Fosdyk, supposedly &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;″s steward. In this version, the crew had gathered on a temporary swimming platform to watch a swimming contest, when the platform suddenly collapsed. All except Fosdyk were drowned or eaten by sharks. Unlike Doyle&#x27;s story, the magazine proposed this as a serious solution to the enigma, but it contained many simple mistakes, including &quot;Griggs&quot; for Briggs, &quot;Boyce&quot; for Morehouse, Briggs&#x27;s daughter as a seven-year-old child rather than a two-year-old, a crew of 13, and an ignorance of nautical language. Many more people were convinced by a plausible literary hoax of the 1920s perpetrated by Irish writer Laurence J. Keating, again presented as a survivor&#x27;s story of one John Pemberton. This one told a complex tale of murder, madness, and collusion with the &quot;Dei Gratia&quot;. It included basic errors, such as using Doyle&#x27;s name (&quot;Marie Celeste&quot;) and misnaming key personnel. Nevertheless, the story was so convincingly told that the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; of July 26, 1926, believed its truth to be beyond dispute. Hastings describes Keating&#x27;s hoax as &quot;an impudent trick by a man not without imaginative ability.&quot;

In 1924, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; published a story by Captain R. Lucy, whose alleged informant was &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;″s former boatswain, although no such person is recorded in the registered crew list. In this tale, Briggs and his crew are cast in the role of predators; they sight a derelict steamer, which they board and find deserted with £3,500 of gold and silver in its safe. They decide to split the money, abandon &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, and seek new lives in Spain, which they reach by using the steamer&#x27;s lifeboats. Hastings finds it astonishing that such an unlikely story was widely believed for a time; readers, he says, &quot;were fooled by the magic of print.&quot;

Other explanations have suggested paranormal intervention; an undated edition of the &quot;British Journal of Astrology&quot; describes the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; story as &quot;a mystical experience&quot;, connecting it &quot;with the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, the lost continent of Atlantis, and the British Israel Movement&quot;. The Bermuda Triangle has been invoked, even though &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; was abandoned in a completely different part of the Atlantic. Similar fantasies have considered theories of abduction by aliens in flying saucers.

==Later career and final voyage==

&quot;Mary Celeste&quot; left Genoa on June 26, 1873, and arrived in New York on September 19. The Gibraltar hearings, with newspaper stories of bloodshed and murder, had made her an unpopular ship; Hastings records that she &quot;... rotted on wharves where nobody wanted her.&quot; In February 1874, the consortium sold the ship, at a considerable loss, to a partnership of New York businessmen.
Under this new ownership, &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; sailed mainly in the West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, regularly losing money. Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of St. Helena, where she had called to seek medical assistance for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging the idea that the ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship&#x27;s port of registration changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, in his study of the affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.

In November 1884, Parker conspired with a group of Boston shippers, who filled &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; with a largely worthless cargo, misrepresented on the ship&#x27;s manifest as valuable goods and insured for US$30,000 ($ today). On December 16, Parker set out for Port-au-Prince, the capital and chief port of Haiti. On January 3, 1885, &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; approached the port via the channel between Gonâve Island and the mainland, in which lay a large and well-charted coral reef, the Rochelois Bank. Parker deliberately ran the ship on to this reef, ripping out her bottom and wrecking her beyond repair. He and the crew then rowed themselves ashore, where Parker sold the salvageable cargo for $500 to the American consul, and instituted insurance claims for the alleged value.

When the consul reported that what he had bought was almost worthless, the ship&#x27;s insurers began a thorough investigation, which soon revealed the truth of the over-insured cargo. In July 1885, Parker and the shippers were tried in Boston for conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. Parker was additionally charged with &quot;wilfully cast[ing] away the ship,&quot; a crime known as barratry, which at the time carried the death penalty. The conspiracy case was heard first, but on August 15, the jury announced that they could not agree on a verdict. Some jurors were unwilling to risk prejudicing Parker&#x27;s forthcoming capital trial by finding him guilty on the conspiracy charge. Rather than ordering an expensive retrial, the judge negotiated an arrangement whereby the defendants withdrew their insurance claims and repaid all they had received. The barratry charge against Parker was deferred, and he was allowed to go free. Nevertheless, his professional reputation was ruined, and he died in poverty three months later. One of his co-defendants went mad, and another killed himself. Begg observes that &quot;if the court of man could not punish these men ... the curse that had devilled the ship since her first skipper Robert McLellan had died on her maiden voyage could reach beyond the vessel&#x27;s watery grave and exact its own terrible retribution.&quot;

In August 2001, an expedition headed by the marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found the remains of a ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a few pieces of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;″s 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; demise.

==Legacy and commemorations==
&quot;Mary Celeste&quot; was not the first reported case of a ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas. Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists other such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of these stories, it is the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; that is remembered; the ship&#x27;s name, or the misspelled &quot;Marie Celeste&quot;, has become fixed in people&#x27;s minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.

In October 1955, , a 70-ton motor vessel, disappeared in the South Pacific while traveling between Samoa and Tokelau, with 25 people on board. The vessel was found a month later, deserted and drifting north of Vanua Levu, from its route. None of those aboard were seen again, and a commission of inquiry failed to establish an explanation. David Wright, the affair&#x27;s principal historian, has described the case as &quot;... a classic marine mystery of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; proportions.&quot;

The &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; story inspired two well-received radio plays in the 1930s, by L. Du Garde Peach and Tim Healey respectively, and a stage version of Peach&#x27;s play in 1949. Several novels have been published, generally offering natural rather than fantastic explanations. In 1935, the British film company Hammer Film Productions issued &quot;The Mystery of the Mary Celeste&quot; (retitled &quot;Phantom Ship&quot; for American audiences), starring Bela Lugosi as a deranged sailor. It was not a commercial success, although Begg considers it &quot;a period piece well worth watching&quot;. A 1938 short film titled &quot;The Ship That Died&quot; presents dramatizations of a range of theories to explain the abandonment: mutiny, fear of explosion due to alcohol fumes, and the supernatural.

In November 2007, the Smithsonian Channel screened a documentary, &quot;The True Story of the Mary Celeste&quot;, which investigated many aspects of the case without offering any definite solution. One theory proposed pump congestion and instrument malfunction. The &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; had been used for transporting coal, which is known for its dust, before it was loaded with alcohol. The pump was found disassembled on deck, so the crew may have been attempting to repair it. The hull was packed full, and the captain would have no way of judging how much water had been taken on while navigating rough seas. The filmmakers postulated that the chronometer was faulty, meaning that Briggs could have ordered abandonment thinking that they were close to Santa Maria, when they were farther west.

At Spencer&#x27;s Island, &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; and her lost crew are commemorated by a monument at the site of the brigantine&#x27;s construction and by a memorial outdoor cinema built in the shape of the vessel&#x27;s hull. Postage stamps commemorating the incident have been issued by Gibraltar (twice) and by the Maldives (twice, once with the name of the ship misspelt as &quot;Marie Celeste&quot;).

<doc id="408094" wikidata="Q2711767" url="?curid=408094" title="Startopia">
<text>Startopia is a video game by Mucky Foot Productions (formed by ex-Bullfrog employees) and published by Eidos in June 2001, in which the player administers various space stations with the task of developing them into popular hubs. The game has a comical overtone, with lighthearted humour and cartoonish aliens. The game was re-released on GOG.com in September 2012 and was added to the Steam catalogue in October 2013.

&quot;Startopia&quot; was shortlisted for BAFTA PC Game of the Year in 2001.

==Gameplay==

The player is tasked with developing a series of space stations according to the wishes of various employers. The game is set after an apocalyptic galactic war, and many of the stations are in a state of considerable disrepair. It is hinted that these space stations are essentially the last few space-based environments available to the denizens of &quot;Startopia&quot;, as most of them had been destroyed during the galactic war.

The player has no direct control over the aliens that wander about the station. Instead, it is the player&#x27;s job to construct rooms and hire aliens to staff them. The rooms provide basic necessities as well as recreation, encouraging visitors to remain on the station and continue spending money. Each type of alien is suited to a particular kind of task, and individual aliens have a set of statistics that determine their value as an employee. The actual goal for the player varies from one scenario to the next; in some scenarios, the player is expected to meet an economic goal, while in other scenarios the player is required to perform a specific task such as converting a certain number of aliens, or taking over the entire station by force. A sandbox mode is also available.

As with most business simulation games, the player builds facilities and hires workers to operate them. Some rooms take care of basic necessities such as food, sanitation, and health care, while others provide entertainment or love. Visitors may be hired by the player to remain on the station and attend to its facilities.

The space station has a toroidal shape, and it is divided by sectors. Additional sectors can be opened by paying a certain amount of energy for repairs. When sectors from two different players are adjacent, they can be opened to allow visitors to move between them. A war can also be started, allowing players to conquer other sectors by hacking an opponent´s sector door using security droids. The space station has three decks:

* The engineering deck is the biggest and the one that allows a biggest variety of building to be constructed.
* At the pleasure deck, buildings for assessing love and fun necessities can be built.
* The bio deck satisfies nature and religion necessities. Additionally, plants can be harvested for obtaining supplies. The deck can be terraformed by modifying temperature, humidity, water level and height.
The player can trade with a merchant called Arona Daal since the start of the game. In order to trade with other species merchants, that provides better prices, the player has to build a star dock and have an active communications center.

Other mechanic of Startopia is research.By hiring Turakken employees and having a research lab, the player can discover new technologies and upgrade those technologies. In order to research a new technology, an object must be introduced in the lab´s analyzer. If the object´s technologies has not discovered yet, the player will get the technology, and the item´s production will be enabled at the factory. If that technology is already researched, it may unlock a new technology from the same brand of the tech tree or improve the current technology, reducing energy cost for producing the item. The analyzer can also disable bombs.When there are not items in the analyzer, the employees will randomly update previously discovered technologies.

In order to maintain the station operational, the player must hire employees among the visitors. Employees are required for the function of some buildings, and some species can also provide defense against enemies, spies and monsters. There are two types of droids: scuzzer droids clean the station, build and repair infrastructures, and move crates, whereas security scuzzers are part of the armed forces of the station, detain or expel criminals and can also hack enemy doors.

In addition to normal visitors, the station can also receive enemy agents. An agent can be disguised as a normal alien or appear as a shady human character sneaking around the station.

&quot;Startopia&quot; draws inspiration from and makes frequent references to mainstream science fiction, such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (the player&#x27;s assistant computer &quot;VAL&quot; is a parody of &quot;Space Odyssey&quot;&#x27;s HAL), &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. &quot;Startopia&quot; is dedicated to the memory of Douglas Adams, author of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;, who died during the game&#x27;s production.

==Reception==
John Lee reviewed the PC version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Although a bit short on missions, it turns out to be a real kick to build your own luxury hotel in space. 

&quot;Startopia&quot; received generally favorable reviews upon its release. It holds an average of 85% and 86/100 on aggregate web sites GameRankings and Metacritic.

&quot;Startopia&quot; sold approximately 110,000 copies.

==Legacy==
During the August 2019 Gamescom, Realmforge Studios and Kalypso Media announced &quot;Spacebase Startopia&quot;, a new game based on &quot;Startopia&quot;. It was scheduled to release on October 23, 2020, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows and in 2021 for Nintendo Switch, would include both competitive and co-operative multiplayer elements. After delays in production, the remake has then been officially released for all platforms on March 26, 2021.

In 1998 the busing program was abolished due to a settlement in federal court.

Matthew Henson Elementary School was previously in the CDP. It was scheduled to close in 2009. In 2012 EXCEL Academy agreed to open a charter school in the former Henson space, and it moved from its previous campus in Riverdale.

Other area schools:
* Kenmoor Elementary School
* Palmer Park Elementary School
* Columbia Park Elementary School
* John Carroll Elementary School - closed in 2009
* Cora L. Rice Elementary School
* Thomas Pullen Creative &amp; Performing Arts Academy

===Colleges and universities===
Landover had career-based colleges, such as Fortis College, that offer programs including bio-technician, medical assisting, and medical coding and billing.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Landover is one of the few regions in the Washington, D.C. area that is served directly by multiple separate Washington Metro rail lines. Landover is served by the Orange, Blue, and Silver lines (many DC area suburbs are not served directly by Metrorail at all). The Landover Metro station serves the northern portion of Landover on the Orange Line. This station is also the primary metro station that serves the Landover area. The Morgan Boulevard Metro station, constructed in 2004, serves the southern portion of Landover on the Blue and Silver Lines and is the main rail terminus providing access to Commanders Field, which is home to the Washington Commanders in addition to many other sporting and entertainment events. Landover also has a special Metrobus Division also houses many Metrobuses that serve routes in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland.

In addition to the Landover and Morgan Boulevard Metro Stations that primarily serve the Landover area, Landover residents have access to other metro stations nearby, such as New Carrollton, Cheverly, Largo, and Addison Road-Seat Pleasant.

I-495/95, the Capital Beltway, crosses U.S. Route 50 in Landover. The Beltway also has junctions with Maryland Route 202 (Landover Road) and Brightseat Road, which leads directly to FedExField.

===Shopping===
Landover was the home of Landover Mall, owned and operated by Lerner Enterprises. Built in 1972, it was the first enclosed mall in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to house four high-end retail anchor stores: Garfinkel&#x27;s, Hecht&#x27;s (owned by the May company), Woodward and Lothrop (popularly known as Woodies), and Sears. The mall also housed a multiplex movie theater located in the basement of the northeast corridor of the building. Located at the Capital Beltway and Landover Road, the mall neighbored the towns of Palmer Park, Ardmore, Glenarden, and Largo. Palmer Park was the hometown of Olympic boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard. Garfinkel&#x27;s closed in 1990, Woodies closed in 1995 and was replaced with a J.C. Penney store that lasted from 1996 to 2001, and Hecht&#x27;s closed in 2002 with the opening of the Bowie Town Center located in Bowie. The entire mall officially closed in 2003 and was demolished in 2006, with the exception of Sears. Sears closed in 2014 and was later demolished.

With the arrival in 1997 of FedExField, the mall&#x27;s parking lot is used for overflow parking. In 2007, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Prince George&#x27;s County officials were in the midst of developing plans to transform the area where Landover Mall once stood. County officials propose to build luxury townhouses, trendy stores, and office buildings. The goal of the project is to transform the area into a residential and cultural hub that replicates the Bowie Town Center, and The Boulevard at the Capital Centre; the latter is in Lake Arbor CDP and has a Largo postal address.

<doc id="408101" wikidata="Q1354273" url="?curid=408101" title="Alex Kidd in Miracle World">
<text>is a platform game for the Master System. It was released in Japan on November 1, 1986, followed by North America in December 1986, and Europe in 1987. It was later built into many Master System and Master System II consoles. A remake by Merge Games and Jankenteam, titled Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX, was released on June 22, 2021.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot; is a 2D platform game. The player must finish levels and overcome obstacles and puzzles in both scrolling and single-screen environments. Throughout the 17 stages, Alex faces many monsters and the three henchmen of Janken the Great, before facing Janken himself.

Alex&#x27;s punching ability is used to destroy enemies and to break rocks in order to access new paths and to collect items such as money which can then be used to purchase other items including vehicles such as motorbikes and helicopters. At the end of many stages, Alex plays jan-ken-pon (rock-paper-scissors) with one of Janken&#x27;s henchmen. Alex dies with one hit, or by losing a game of rock, paper, scissors.

The game has no save system, but by holding the directional pad up and pressing the 2 button eight times at the Game Over screen, the player will restart the level with three new lives, at a cost of 400 Baums (the in-game currency).

==Story==
A young martial artist named Alex Kidd learns of a villain named Janken the Great who has defeated King Thunder of the city of Radaxian and who has kidnapped his son, Prince Egle (or &#x27;Igul&#x27;), and Egle&#x27;s fiancée Princess Lora. Discovering that he is the lost son of King Thunder, Alex sets out to rescue the kingdom. On his quest, he defeats Janken&#x27;s henchmen and retrieves various items which lead him toward Janken whom he defeats and sees turned to stone. Alex retrieves the crown, and the people of Radaxian are restored under the newly crowned King Egle.

==Development and release==
&quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot; originally began development in 1984 as a licensed tie-in game based on the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series. However, during development, the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; license expired and Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama ordered the developers to start the game over from scratch.

The game was originally only available as a cartridge but was later built into many editions of both the Master System and the Master System II power base, enabling play without the use of a game cartridge. From 1990 onwards, a slightly different version was integrated into the US, Australian and European versions of the Master System II and also some Australian and European versions of the original Master System. There were two differences: firstly when changing targets in the game map, Alex is shown eating onigiri in the original version (and the 2008 Wii Virtual Console port), and a hamburger in the integrated version. Secondly, the original version used button 2 to hit and button 1 to jump; these controls were inverted in the integrated version.

The game was released alongside &quot;Super Hang-On&quot; and &quot;The Revenge of Shinobi&quot; as part of &quot;Sega Vintage Collection: Alex Kidd and Co.&quot;, which was released for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in May 2012. This version allows play of any region version of the game (the European version retaining a 50 Hz framerate) and the Master System II variation. The original version is included on the AtGames Sega Genesis Flashback HD compilation, a dedicated console with games from the Sega Genesis, Master System, and Game Gear.

==Reception==
The game has been critically acclaimed since its release. In 1987, the French magazine &quot;Génération 4&quot; gave the game a highly positive score. In 1991, &quot;Sega Pro&quot; magazine stated that, with &quot;so much to do and so many different ways of doing it, this is one of those games you will keep coming back to even when you have finished it completely.&quot; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine in 1991 described the game as &quot;Sega&#x27;s answer to Mario&quot; and concluded that the &quot;absorbing gameplay will have you glued to your screen for hours on end.&quot;

In a 2008 retro review, &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Alex Kidd&quot; a score of 9 out of 10 and an &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; award, calling it &quot;an exceptional platformer with loads of action and some great puzzle-solving challenges&quot; that &quot;still holds up remarkably well.&quot; IGN also gave the Wii Virtual Console release a score of 9 out of 10.

==Remake==
A remake of the game, titled &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX&quot;, was announced on June 10, 2020, and released on June 22, 2021. The game is developed by Merge Games and Jankenteam for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows (Steam), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The remake features new levels, new NPCs, alternate boss fights, and can instantly change between modern or retro-style graphics by using the right trigger button. Once the player completes the game, the player unlocks two additional modes: Classic Mode, which is an upscaled Master System port of the original game, and Boss Rush, where the player must defeat all the bosses at Rock Paper Scissors and follow-up battle without dying.

<text>Carmody Hills is an unincorporated community in Prince George&#x27;s County in the U.S. state of Maryland. Because it is not formally incorporated, it has no official boundaries, but the United States Census Bureau has defined a census-designated place consisting of Carmody Hills and the adjacent community of Pepper Mill Village, together designated &quot;Peppermill Village&quot;, for statistical purposes. (At the 2000 census the area was delineated as &quot;Carmody Hills-Pepper Mill Village&quot;.) Carmody Hills is located on the south side of Seat Pleasant Drive and east of Seat Pleasant.

==History==
Carmody Hills, platted in the 1930s, is one of several subdivisions constructed in the early to mid 20th century around the Town of Seat Pleasant. Suburban development in this area of Prince George’s County began in the late 19th century and continued to grow throughout the 20th century due to its proximity to Washington and access to the city via railroads, streetcar lines, and road networks. The early 20th-century communities were fostered by the Chesapeake Beach Railway (1898) and the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad (1908). As the popular mode of transportation shifted from streetcar line to the automobile in the 1930s and 1940s, highways gave suburban residents access to the city. The George Palmer Highway (present-day Martin Luther King, Jr. Highway) was constructed on the right-of-way of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad in the early 1940s.

The first development of the Carmody Hills subdivision began in the early 1930s. House construction and road development continued from the 1930s through the 1970s. By 1942, the community was well established with approximately 130 houses on a grid pattern of nine north-south streets and three east-west streets. In the immediate post-World War II period, vacant lots within the established residential blocks were developed. Between 1957 and 1965, the community expanded one block to the south and several blocks to the east. Also constructed within that time period was the Carmody Hills School. An evaluation of housing conditions in Carmody Hills in the late 1960s found approximately one-third of the houses in need of enhancement. Code enforcement, as well as street paving and drainage, encouraged the construction of new houses in the 1970s in areas of the community previously inaccessible.

<text>Oxon Hill is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in southern Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. Oxon Hill is a close suburb of Washington, located southeast of the downtown district and east of Alexandria, Virginia. In 2008, the National Harbor development on the shore of the Potomac River opened in Oxon Hill; it has since become a CDP of its own.

For the 1990 and 2000 censuses, the United States Census Bureau defined a census-designated place consisting of Oxon Hill and the adjacent community of Glassmanor, designated Oxon Hill-Glassmanor, for statistical purposes. As of the 2010 census, Oxon Hill was delineated separately and had a population of 17,722. Per the 2020 census, the population was 18,791.

==History==

Oxon Hill was named for the colonial 18th century manor home of Thomas Addison (which burned in 1895 but was replaced in 1929 by a large 49-room neo-Georgian-style home called Oxon Hill Manor, standing on a bluff over the Potomac River). The current Manor is now owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and is used for cultural activities, as well as being rented for weddings and special events. &quot;Oxon&quot; is an abbreviation for the Latin &quot;Oxoniensis&quot;, meaning &quot;of Oxford.&quot; The area now known as Oxon Hill reminded Addison of the area near Oxford, England. The Revolutionary patriot John Hanson died while visiting the first Manor, and may be buried there in an unmarked grave.

Oxon Hill Manor, the Butler House, Oxon Cove Park, and St. Ignatius Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Today the community is bisected by the busy Capital Beltway (I-95/495), which includes the interstate Woodrow Wilson Bridge built in 1961. The enlarged bridge was opened December 15, 2008, and highway interchanges and ramps near the bridge were also re-aligned and re-configured. Prior to that date, traffic backed up into Oxon Hill daily for decades as 250,000–300,000 vehicles a day crossed the Wilson Bridge.

Oxon Hill includes many garden apartment and townhouse communities along with single-family detached homes built mostly between the 1940s when suburban development began, through the early 1990s (except for the newer National Harbor condominiums), including the incorporated town Forest Heights. Oxon Hill&#x27;s two principal shopping centers (&quot;Rivertowne&quot;, built about 1985 and &quot;Eastover&quot;, built about 1955) attract neighborhood customers as well as shoppers from nearby Southeast Washington, D.C. Eastover, located at the D.C./state line, is a hub of many bus routes, some of them operating 24 hours a day, and has a Prince George&#x27;s County Police station. The apartment communities closest to the D.C. line are informally called by their original name &quot;Glassmanor&quot;, although rental companies have officially given them newer names. Rather unusual community features of Oxon Hill are a nursing home and a large cultural center, both operated for an ethnic Filipino population who are numerous in Oxon Hill and Fort Washington.

Until about 1960, the community used the mailing address Washington, D.C., before getting its own postal designation. About 1980, the United States Postal Service detached the two-thirds of greater Oxon Hill that was furthest from Washington, D.C., and re-defined that part as a new postal designation, Fort Washington, MD. To make mail sorting easier at that time, the new postal boundary line separating the two Maryland communities was drawn along already existing zip code boundaries. (The former zip 20021 portion of Oxon Hill remained Oxon Hill with the new code 20745, while everything in the former zip 20022 portion of Oxon Hill about 1980 was automatically renamed the new Fort Washington 20744.) Illogically, this partitioning reassigned some areas that seem to be almost in the heart of Oxon Hill (such as all of the Bock Road, Tucker Road, Murray Hills, and Brinkley Road areas, including several large prominent churches, Rosecroft Raceway, the ice rink, and ironically even Oxon Hill Middle School) to Fort Washington mailing addresses, which can cause confusion.

==Geography==
Oxon Hill is located in Prince George&#x27;s County along Maryland Route 210 (Indian Head Highway) and Maryland Route 414 (Oxon Hill Road), less than south of the boundary of Washington. The CDP lies directly south of the Capital Beltway (I-495/I-95), just east of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge over the Potomac River.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the total area of Oxon Hill is , of which is land and , or 0.20%, is water.

==Demographics==
Oxon Hill first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census formed from
parts of the deleted Oxon Hill-Glassmanor CDP.

===2020 census===
==Parks and recreation==
Rosecroft Raceway (founded in 1949) and Henson Creek Golf Course (a nine-hole course) are among Oxon Hill&#x27;s recreational attractions; Rosecroft Raceway offers a limited number of harness horse racing dates throughout the year, as well as betting on select televised simulcast races from around the country (per article in Washington Post, May 20, 2010). (The Maryland slot machine referendum in November 2008 did not include Rosecroft in its list of possible sites to add slots.)

The Parks Commission&#x27;s 1974 Tucker Road ice skating rink, at the Tucker Road Athletic Complex, was enclosed and expanded to year-round use in 2005; across from it is the Tucker Road Community Center and nearby is a private swimming club, the Oxon Hill Recreation Club (OHRC). OHRC has been in continuous operation since 1958. A 37,000 square foot gymnasium and recreation and learning center (Southern Regional Technology &amp; Recreation Complex) opened in 2013, on Bock Road. The Henson Creek paved hiker-biker trail extends paralleling Henson Creek, a tributary to the Potomac River. Oxon Cove Farm (formerly Oxon Hill Children&#x27;s Farm) is a free of charge, educational facility operated daily for families by the National Park Service adjacent to, but separate from National Harbor. The farm also has a bicycle trail used by a few commuters to nearby government facilities. Public indoor and outdoor swimming pools are also located on Allentown Road near Padgett&#x27;s Corner at the Allentown Splash, Tennis and Fitness Park.

Oxon Hill is also the location of National Harbor, a major development on the Potomac River: a mixed-use community including 2,500 residential units, 4,000 hotel rooms, of retail, upscale dining, and entertainment, and of class-&quot;A&quot; office space, along with one of the largest marinas on the Potomac and the 2,000 room Gaylord National Resort &amp; Convention Center, the largest hotel in the entire Washington area. The first phase of the development began opening in April 2008, and is currently well into its second phase.

The MGM National Harbor Resort Casino, located at the entrance to the National Harbor development and a $950 million project, opened on December 8, 2016.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
Residents are zoned to Prince George&#x27;s County Public Schools (PGCPS):

Elementary schools serving sections of the CDP include Apple Grove, Avalon, J. Frank Dent, Flintstone, Oxon Hill, Valley View and Tayac.

Middle schools serving the CDP include Isaac J. Gourdine, Oxon Hill, and Thurgood Marshall.

High schools serving sections of the CDP include Oxon Hill High School, Crossland High School, and Friendly High School. Oxon Hill High has a magnet science and technology program, which is offered at only three of the county&#x27;s high schools; The original buildings from 1959 have been completely replaced by a new facility, which opened in August 2013.

Another magnet school in Oxon Hill is the K–8 Maya Angelou French Immersion School whose mission is to ensure that all students acquire knowledge and skills, through speaking, reading and writing the French language. The French Immersion school is also attached to the John Hanson Montessori School which upholds the teaching ideals of Italian educator Maria Montessori. Both are located in the former John Hanson Junior High School building, which is next door to the main Oxon Hill post office.

There is a Roman Catholic private school, St. Columba School. It was established in 1962.

===Public libraries===
Prince George&#x27;s County Memorial Library System operates the Oxon Hill Library. It completely remodeled and reopened in 2005. Originally built in 1967, the Oxon Hill Library Branch contains the Sojourner Truth Room, an African American research collection. This comprehensive collection of reference materials on African American history and culture includes over 16,000 cataloged items (many are rare or out-of-print), periodicals, sheet music by African American composers, pictures and posters. Vertical files contain pamphlets, clippings and bibliographies. Copies of selected materials are also in the Oxon Hill Branch&#x27;s circulating collection. An extensive collection of current and historical periodicals, including the NAACP&#x27;s &quot;Crisis&quot; from 1910, the &quot;Journal of Negro History&quot; from 1916 and &quot;Ebony&quot; from 1945. The collection includes original editions of some slave narratives, as well as many reprint editions and the thirty-one volume Writer&#x27;s Project series. Other topics are antislavery and slavery tracts, literary criticism, and the history of African Americans in Maryland and Prince George&#x27;s County.

==Government==
Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department District 4 Station in Glassmanor CDP, with an Oxon Hill postal address, serves the community.

The U.S. Postal Service operates the Oxon Hill Post Office in the CDP.

<text>Glassmanor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 18,430. In the 1990 and 2000 censuses, the United States Census Bureau had placed Glassmanor and the adjacent community of Oxon Hill in the &quot;Oxon Hill-Glassmanor&quot; census-designated place for statistical purposes. Glassmanor was last delineated separately in 1980, when the CDP recorded a population of 7,751.

The original Glassmanor apartments were built &quot;circa&quot; 1950 by the Glassman company, just outside the border of southeast Washington. In the mid-1950s, the Eastover shopping center was built across the highway, followed by other adjoining apartment projects in the 1960s. U.S. Senator George McGovern, who was the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential candidate in 1972, lived briefly in Glassmanor while a freshman congressman. The area has undergone tremendous demographic and social changes since that time.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Glassmanor has a total area of , all land. The CDP is bordered by Washington, D.C. to the northwest, the town of Forest Heights to the west, Oxon Hill to the south, Temple Hills to the southeast, Marlow Heights to the east, and Hillcrest Heights to the northeast. Interstate 495/95, the Capital Beltway, forms the southern boundary of the Glassmanor CDP.

==Demographics==
Glassmanor first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census formed from part of
deleted Oxon Hill-Glassmanor CDP and additional area.

===2020 census===
==Government==
Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department District 4 Station in Glassmanor CDP, with an Oxon Hill postal address, serves the community. The Prince George&#x27;s County Fire/EMS Department and Oxon Hill Volunteer Fire Department provide fire protection and emergency medical services from Fire Station 842 located in Glassmanor.

==Education==
Residents are zoned to Prince George&#x27;s County Public Schools (PGCPS).

Elementary schools serving sections of the CDP include Barnaby Manor, Forest Heights, Glassmanor, and Valley View. Benjamin Stoddert and Oxon Hill middle schools serve sections of the CDP. All residents are zoned to Potomac High School.

The former Owens Road Elementary School was located within the Glassmanor CDP. The school closed on June 18, 2009.

<text>In mathematics, Mahler&#x27;s theorem, introduced by , expresses any continuous &quot;p&quot;-adic function as an infinite series of certain special polynomials. It is the &quot;p&quot;-adic counterpart to the Stone-Weierstrass theorem for continuous real-valued functions on a closed interval.

== Statement ==
Let formula_1 be the forward difference operator. Then for any &quot;p&quot;-adic function formula_2, Mahler&#x27;s theorem states that formula_3 is continuous if and only if its Newton series converges everywhere to formula_3, so that for all formula_5 we have

:formula_6

where

:formula_7

is the formula_8th binomial coefficient polynomial. Here, the formula_8th forward difference is computed by the binomial transform, so thatformula_10Moreover, we have that formula_3 is continuous if and only if the coefficients formula_12 in formula_13 as formula_14.

It is remarkable that as weak an assumption as continuity is enough in the &quot;p&quot;-adic setting to establish convergence of Newton series. By contrast, Newton series on the field of complex numbers are far more tightly constrained, and require Carlson&#x27;s theorem to hold.

<doc id="408113" wikidata="Q299428" url="?curid=408113" title="Cambyses I">
<text>Cambyses I ( &quot;Kambūjiya&quot;) was king of Anshan from c. 580 to 559 BC and the father of Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II), younger son of Cyrus I, and brother of Arukku. He should not be confused with his better-known grandson Cambyses II.

== Etymology ==
The origins of the name of &quot;Cambyses&quot; () is disputed in scholarship; according to some scholars, the name is of Elamite origin, whilst others associate it with Kambojas, an Iranian people who inhabited northwestern India. The name of Cambyses is known in other languages as: Elamite &quot;Kanbuziya&quot;; Akkadian &quot;Kambuziya&quot;; Aramaic &quot;Kanbūzī&quot;.

== Background ==
No records composed during Cambyses&#x27; lifetime have survived. Cambyses was an early member of the Achaemenid dynasty. He was apparently a great-grandson of its founder Achaemenes, grandson of Teispes and son of Cyrus I. His paternal uncle was Ariaramnes and his first cousin was Arsames.

However, around 100 years later, Herodotus claimed that Cambyses I was a vassal of the Median king Astyages and, he solidified his political standing through marriage to one of Astyages&#x27; daughters, whose name wasn&#x27;t explicitly said by Herodotus. This alliance likely helped in securing the support or neutrality of Media as his son, Cyrus, began his military campaigns that eventually led to the founding of the Persian Empire. His role was essential in the transition from a minor regional rule in Anshan to the larger ambitions of the Achaemenid dynasty that dominated much of the ancient Near East.

==Personal life==
According to Herodotus, Cambyses was &quot;a man of good family and quiet habits&quot;. He reigned under the overlordship of Astyages, King of Media. He was reportedly married to Princess Mandane of Media, a daughter of Astyages and Princess Aryenis of Lydia. His wife was reportedly a granddaughter of both Cyaxares of Media and Alyattes of Lydia. The result of their marriage was the birth of his successor Cyrus the Great. According to Nicolas of Damascus, his original name was Atradates, and he was wounded and later died in the Battle of the Persian Border which he, with his son, fought against Astyages. It occurred in about 551 BC, and he is reported to have received an honorable burial.

Also according to Herodotus, Astyages chose Cambyses as a son-in-law because he considered him to pose no threat to the Median throne, having dreamt his daughter would give birth to one who would rule Asia, overthrowing Astyages. This was not quite the case with Cyrus the Great who would go on to depose his grandfather, and to begin the Persian Empire.

<doc id="408116" wikidata="Q18972" url="?curid=408116" title="Réunion ibis">
<text>The Réunion ibis or Réunion sacred ibis (Threskiornis solitarius) is an extinct species of ibis that was endemic to the volcanic island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean. The first subfossil remains were found in 1974, and the ibis was first scientifically described in 1987. Its closest relatives are the Malagasy sacred ibis, the African sacred ibis, and the straw-necked ibis. Travellers&#x27; accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries described a white bird on Réunion that flew with difficulty and preferred solitude, which was subsequently referred to as the &quot;Réunion solitaire&quot;.

In the mid 19th century, the old travellers&#x27; accounts were incorrectly assumed to refer to white relatives of the dodo, due to one account specifically mentioning dodos on the island, and because 17th-century paintings of white dodos had recently surfaced. However, no fossils referable to dodo-like birds were ever found on Réunion, and it was later questioned whether the paintings had anything to do with the island. Other identities were suggested as well, based only on speculations. In the late 20th century, the discovery of ibis subfossils led to the idea that the old accounts actually referred to an ibis species instead. The idea that the &quot;solitaire&quot; and the subfossil ibis are identical was met with limited dissent, but is now widely accepted.

Combined, the old descriptions and subfossils show that the Réunion ibis was mainly white, with this colour merging into yellow and grey. The wing tips and plumes of ostrich-like feathers on its rear were black. The neck and legs were long, and the beak was relatively straight and short for an ibis. It was more robust in build than its extant relatives, but was otherwise quite similar to them. It would have been no longer than 65 cm (25 in) in length. Subfossil wingbones indicate it had reduced flight capabilities, a feature perhaps linked to seasonal fattening. The diet of the Réunion ibis was worms and other items foraged from the soil. In the 17th century, it lived in mountainous areas, but it may have been confined to these remote heights by heavy hunting by humans and predation by introduced animals in the more accessible areas of the island. Visitors to Réunion praised its flavour, and therefore sought after its flesh. These factors are believed to have driven the Réunion ibis to extinction by the early 18th century.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomic history of the Réunion ibis is convoluted and complex, due to the ambiguous and meagre evidence that was available to scientists until the late 20th century. The supposed &quot;white dodo&quot; of Réunion is now believed to have been an erroneous conjecture based on the few contemporary reports which described the Réunion ibis, combined with paintings of white dodos from Mauritius by the Dutch painters Pieter Withoos and Pieter Holsteyn II (and derivatives) from the 17th century that surfaced in the 19th century.

The English Chief Officer John Tatton was the first to mention a specifically white bird on Réunion, in 1625. The French occupied the island from 1646 and onwards, and referred to this bird as the &quot;solitaire&quot;. M. Carré of the French East India Company described the &quot;solitaire&quot; in 1699, explaining the reason for its name:


The marooned French Huguenot François Leguat used the name &quot;solitaire&quot; for the Rodrigues solitaire, a Raphine bird (related to the dodo) he encountered on the nearby island of Rodrigues in the 1690s, but it is thought he borrowed the name from a 1689 tract by Marquis Henri Duquesne which mentioned the Réunion species. Duquesne himself had probably based his own description on an earlier one. No specimens of the &quot;solitaire&quot; were ever preserved.

The two individuals Carré attempted to send to the royal menagerie in France did not survive in captivity. Billiard claimed that the French administrator Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais sent a &quot;solitaire&quot; to France from Réunion around 1740. Since the Réunion ibis is believed to have gone extinct by this date, the bird may actually have been a Rodrigues solitaire.

The only contemporary writer who referred specifically to &quot;dodos&quot; inhabiting Réunion was the Dutch sailor Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe, though he did not mention their colouration:

When his journal was published in 1646, it was accompanied by an engraving which is now known to have been copied after one of the dodos in the Flemish painter Roelant Savery&#x27;s &quot;Crocker Art Gallery sketch&quot;. Since Bontekoe was shipwrecked and lost all his belongings after visiting Réunion in 1619, he may not have written his account until he returned to Holland, seven years later, which would put its reliability in question. He may have concluded in hindsight that it was a dodo, finding what he saw similar to accounts of that bird.

===Early interpretation===

In the 1770s, the French naturalist Comte de Buffon stated that the dodo inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion for unclear reasons. He also combined accounts about the Rodrigues solitaire and a bird from Mauritius (&quot;oiseau de Nazareth&quot;, now thought to be a dodo), as well as the &quot;solitaire&quot; Carré reported from Réunion under one &quot;solitaire&quot; section, indicating he believed there was both a dodo and &quot;solitaire&quot; on Réunion. The English naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland discussed the old descriptions of the &quot;solitaire&quot; in his 1848 book &quot;The Dodo and Its Kindred&quot;, and concluded it was distinct from the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire due to its colouration.

The Belgian scientist Edmond de Sélys Longchamps coined the scientific name &quot;Apterornis solitarius&quot; for the &quot;solitaire&quot; in 1848, apparently making it the type species of the genus, in which he also included two other Mascarene birds only known from contemporary accounts, the red rail and the Réunion swamphen. As the name &quot;Apterornis&quot; had already been used for a different bird by the English biologist Richard Owen, and the other former names were likewise invalid, Bonaparte coined the new binomial &quot;Ornithaptera borbonica&quot; in 1854 (Bourbon was the original French name for Réunion). In 1854, the German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel placed the &quot;solitaire&quot; in the same genus as the dodo, and named it &quot;Didus apterornis&quot;. He restored it strictly according to contemporary accounts, which resulted in an ibis or stork-like bird instead of a dodo.

In 1856, William Coker announced the discovery of a 17th-century &quot;Persian&quot; painting of a white dodo among waterfowl, which he had been shown in England. The artist was later identified as Pieter Withoos, and many prominent 19th-century naturalists subsequently assumed the image depicted the white &quot;solitaire&quot; of Réunion, a possibility originally proposed by ornithologist John Gould. Simultaneously, several similar paintings of white dodos by Pieter Holsteyn II were discovered in the Netherlands. Other paintings and drawings were also later identified as showing white dodos. In 1869, the English ornithologist Alfred Newton argued that the Withoos&#x27; painting and engraving in Bontekoe&#x27;s memoir depicted a living Réunion dodo that had been brought to Holland, while explaining its blunt beak as a result of beak trimming to prevent it from injuring humans. He also brushed aside the inconsistencies between the illustrations and descriptions, especially the long, thin beak implied by one contemporary account.

Newton&#x27;s words particularly cemented the validity of this connection among contemporary peers, and several of them expanded on his views. The Dutch zoologist Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested in 1917 that the discrepancies between the paintings and the old descriptions were due to the paintings showing a female, and that the species was, therefore, sexually dimorphic. The British zoologist Walter Rothschild claimed in 1907 that the yellow wings might have been due to albinism in this particular specimen, since the old descriptions described these as black. 

By the early 20th century, many other paintings and even physical remains were claimed to be of white dodos, amid much speculation. Rothschild commissioned British artist Frederick William Frohawk to restore the &quot;solitaire&quot; as both a white dodo, based on the Withoos painting, and as a distinct bird based on the French traveller Sieur Dubois&#x27; 1674 description, for his 1907 book &quot;Extinct Birds&quot;. In 1937, the Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka suggested that the old accounts and paintings represented two different species, and referred to the white dodos of the paintings as &quot;Victoriornis imperialis&quot; (honouring King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy), and the &quot;solitaire&quot; of the accounts as &quot;Ornithaptera solitarius&quot; (using the generic name coined by Bonaparte). Hachisuka also suggested that a 1618 Italian illustration previously identified as a dodo being hunted, actually showed a male, brown Réunion solitaire (he ruled out Rodrigues because that island was not yet inhabited at the time). To him, this cleared up the confusion between the two species, which is why he named the white dodo for the King of Italy (the illustration being from Italy). Today the illustration is thought to depict an ostrich or a bustard.

===Modern interpretation===
Until the late 1980s, belief in the existence of a white dodo on Réunion was the orthodox view, and only a few researchers doubted the connection between the &quot;solitaire&quot; accounts and the dodo paintings. The American ornithologist James Greenway cautioned in 1958 that no conclusions could be made without solid evidence such as fossils, and that nothing indicated that the white dodos in the paintings had anything to do with Réunion. In 1970, the American ornithologist Robert W. Storer predicted that if any such remains were found, they would not belong to Raphinae like the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire (or even to the pigeon family like them).

The first subfossil bird remains on Réunion, the lower part of a tarsometatarsus, was found in 1974, and considered a new species of stork in the genus &quot;Ciconia&quot; by the British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles in 1987. The remains were found in a cave, which indicated it had been brought there and eaten by early settlers. It was speculated that the remains could have belonged to a large, mysterious bird described by Leguat, and called &quot;Leguat&#x27;s giant&quot; by some ornithologists. &quot;Leguat&#x27;s giant&quot; is now thought to be based on a locally extinct population of greater flamingos. Also in 1987, a subfossil tarsometatarsus of an ibis found in a cave was described as &quot;Borbonibis latipes&quot; (the specific name means &quot;wide foot&quot;) by the French palaeontologists Cécile Mourer-Chauviré and François Moutou, and thought related to the bald ibises of the genus &quot;Geronticus&quot;.

In 1994, Cowles concluded that the &quot;stork&quot; remains he had reported belonged to &quot;Borbonibis&quot;, since their tarsometatarsi were similar. The 1987 discovery led the English biologist Anthony S. Cheke to suggest to one of the describers of &quot;Borbonibis&quot; that the subfossils may have been of the &quot;solitaire&quot;. In 1995, the French ecologist Jean-Michel Probst reported his discovery of a bird mandible during an excavation on Réunion the former year, and suggested it may have belonged to the ibis or the &quot;solitaire&quot;. In 1995, the describers of &quot;Borbonibis latipes&quot; suggested that it represented the &quot;Réunion solitaire&quot;, and reassigned it to the ibis genus &quot;Threskiornis&quot;, now combined with the specific name &quot;&quot; from de Sélys-Longchamps&#x27; 1848 binomial for the &quot;solitaire&quot; (making &quot;Borbonibis latipes&quot; a junior synonym). The authors pointed out that the contemporary descriptions matched the appearance and behaviour of an ibis more than a member of the Raphinae, especially due to its comparatively short and straight mandible, and because ibis remains were abundant in some localities; it would be strange if contemporary writers never mentioned such a relatively common bird, whereas they mentioned most other species subsequently known from fossils.
The possible origin of the 17th-century white dodo paintings was examined, by the Spanish biologist Arturo Valledor de Lozoya in 2003, and independently by experts of Mascarene fauna Cheke and Julian Hume in 2004. The Withoos and Holsteyn paintings are clearly derived from each other, and Withoos likely copied his dodo from one of Holsteyn&#x27;s works, since these were probably produced at an earlier date. All later white dodo pictures are thought to be based on these paintings. According to the aforementioned writers, it appears these pictures were themselves derived from a whitish dodo in a previously unreported painting called &quot;Landscape with Orpheus and the Animals&quot;, produced by Roelant Savery c. 1611. The dodo was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in Prague; a &quot;walghvogel&quot; (old Dutch for dodo) described as having a &quot;dirty off-white colouring&quot; was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607–1611).

Savery&#x27;s several later dodo images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had by then seen a normal specimen. Cheke and Hume concluded the painted specimen was white due to albinism, and that this peculiar feature was the reason it was collected from Mauritius and brought to Europe. Valledor de Lozoya instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens, or simply due to artistic license. In 2018, the British ornithologist Jolyon C. Parish and Cheke suggested that the painting was instead executed after 1614, or even after 1626, based on some of the motifs.

While many subfossil elements from throughout the skeleton have been assigned to the Réunion ibis, no remains of dodo-like birds have ever been found on Réunion. A few later sources have taken issue with the proposed ibis-identity of the &quot;solitaire&quot;, and have even regarded the &quot;white dodo&quot; as a valid species. The British writer Errol Fuller agrees that the 17th-century paintings do not depict Réunion birds, but has questioned whether the ibis subfossils are necessarily connected to the &quot;solitaire&quot; accounts. He notes that no evidence indicates the extinct ibis survived until the time Europeans reached Réunion. Cheke and Hume have dismissed such sentiments as being mere &quot;belief&quot; and &quot;hope&quot; in the existence of a dodo on the island.

===Evolution===

The volcanic island of Réunion is only three million years old, whereas Mauritius and Rodrigues, with each of their flightless Raphine species, are eight to ten million years old, and according to Cheke and Hume it is unlikely that either bird would have been capable of flying after five or more million years of adapting to the islands. Therefore, it is unlikely that Réunion could have been colonised by flightless birds from these islands, and only flighted species on the island have relatives there. Three million years is enough time for flightless and weak flying abilities to have evolved in bird species on Réunion itself, but Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues pointed out that such species would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano Piton des Neiges between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent species would therefore likely be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event, which is not enough time for a bird to become flightless.

In 1995, a morphological study by Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues suggested the closest extant relatives of the Réunion ibis are the African sacred ibis (&quot;T. aethiopicus&quot;) of Africa and the straw-necked ibis (&quot;T. spinicollis&quot;) of Australia. Cheke and Hume instead suggested that it was closest to the Malagasy sacred ibis (&quot;T. bernieri&quot;), and therefore of ultimately African origin.

==Description==

Contemporary accounts described the species as having white and grey plumage merging into yellow, black wing tips and tail feathers, a long neck and legs, and limited flight capabilities. Dubois&#x27; 1674 account is the most detailed contemporary description of the bird, here as translated by Strickland in 1848:
According to Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues, the plumage colouration mentioned is similar to that of the related African sacred ibis and straw-necked ibis, which are also mainly white and glossy black. In the reproductive season, the ornamental feathers on the back and wing tips of the African sacred ibis look similar to the feathers of an ostrich, which echoes Dubois&#x27; description. Likewise, a subfossil lower jaw found in 1994 showed that the bill of the Réunion ibis was relatively short and straight for an ibis, which corresponds with Dubois&#x27; woodcock comparison. Cheke and Hume have suggested that the French word (&quot;bécasse&quot;) from Dubois&#x27; original description, usually translated to &quot;woodcock&quot;, could also mean oystercatcher, another bird with a long, straight, but slightly more robust, bill. They have also pointed out that the last sentence is mistranslated, and actually means the bird could be caught by running after it. The bright colouration of the plumage mentioned by some authors may refer to iridescence, as seen in the straw-necked ibis.

Subfossils of the Réunion ibis show that it was more robust, likely much heavier, and had a larger head than the African sacred and straw-necked ibises. It was nonetheless similar to them in most features. According to Hume, it would have been no longer than 65 cm (25 in) in length, the size of the African sacred ibis. Rough protuberances on the wing bones of the Réunion ibis are similar to those of birds that use their wings in combat. It was perhaps flightless, but this has not left significant osteological traces; no complete skeletons have been collected, but of the known pectoral elements, only one feature indicates reduction in flight capability. The coracoid is elongated and the radius and ulna are robust, as in flighted birds, but a particular foramen (or opening) between a metacarpal and the alular is otherwise only known from flightless birds, such as some ratites, penguins, and several extinct species.

==Behaviour and ecology==

As contemporary accounts are inconsistent on whether the &quot;solitaire&quot; was flightless or had some flight capability, Mourer-Chauvire and colleagues suggested that this was dependent on seasonal fat-cycles, meaning that individuals fattened themselves during cool seasons, but were slim during hot seasons; perhaps it could not fly when it was fat, but could when it was not. However, Dubois specifically stated the &quot;solitaires&quot; did not have fat-cycles, unlike most other Réunion birds. The only mention of its diet and exact habitat is the account of the French cartographer Jean Feuilley from 1708, which is also the last record of a living individual:

The diet and mode of foraging described by Feuilley matches that of an ibis, whereas members of the Raphinae are known to have been fruit eaters. The species was termed a land-bird by Dubois, so it did not live in typical ibis habitats such as wetlands. This is similar to the Réunion swamphen, which lived in forest rather than swamps, which is otherwise typical swamphen habitat. Cheke and Hume proposed that the ancestors of these birds colonised Réunion before swamps had developed, and had therefore become adapted to the available habitats. They were perhaps prevented from colonising Mauritius as well due to the presence of red rails there, which may have occupied a similar niche.

The Réunion ibis appears to have lived in high altitudes, and perhaps had a limited distribution. Accounts by early visitors indicate the species was found near their landing sites, but they were found only in remote places by 1667. The bird may have survived in eastern lowlands until the 1670s. Though many late 17th century accounts state the bird was good food, Feuilley stated it tasted bad. This may be because it changed its diet when it moved to more rugged, higher terrain, to escape pigs that destroyed its nests; since it had limited flight capabilities, it probably nested on the ground.

Many other endemic species of Réunion became extinct after the human colonisation and the resulting disruption of the island&#x27;s ecosystem. The Réunion ibis lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the hoopoe starling, the Mascarene parrot, the Réunion parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion scops owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the Réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed &quot;Leiolopisma&quot; skink. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail &quot;Tropidophora carinata&quot; lived on Réunion and Mauritius, but vanished from both islands.

==Extinction==

As Réunion was populated by settlers, the Réunion ibis appears to have become confined to the tops of mountains. Introduced predators such as cats and rats took a toll. Overhunting also contributed and several contemporary accounts state the bird was widely hunted for food. In 1625, John Tatton described the tameness of the bird and how easy it was to hunt, as well as the large quantity consumed:

In 1671, Melet mentioned the culinary quality of this species, and described the slaughter of several types of birds on the island:

The last definite account of the &quot;solitaire&quot; of Réunion was Feuilley&#x27;s from 1708, indicating that the species probably became extinct sometime early in the century. In the 1820s, the French navigator Louis de Freycinet asked an old slave about &quot;drontes&quot; (old Dutch word for dodo), and was told the bird existed around Saint-Joseph when his father was an infant. This would perhaps be a century earlier, but the account may be unreliable. Cheke and Hume suspect that feral cats initially hunted wildlife in the lowlands and later turned to higher inland areas, which were probably the last stronghold of the Réunion ibis, as they were unreachable by pigs. The species is thought to have been driven to extinction around 1710–1715.

<text>On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590, a Concorde passenger jet on an international charter flight from Paris to New York, crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 109 people on board and four on the ground. It was the only fatal Concorde accident during its 27-year operational history.

Whilst taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport, Air France Flight 4590 ran over debris on the runway dropped by an aircraft during the preceding departure, causing a tyre to explode and disintegrate. Tyre fragments, launched upwards at great speed by the rapidly spinning wheel, violently struck the underside of the wing, damaging parts of the landing gear – thus preventing its retraction – and causing the integral fuel tank to rupture. Large amounts of fuel leaking from the rupture ignited, causing a loss of thrust in the left-hand-side engines 1 and 2. The aircraft lifted off, but the loss of thrust, high drag from the extended landing gear, and fire damage to the flight controls made it impossible to maintain control. The jet crashed into a hotel in nearby Gonesse two minutes after takeoff. All nine crew and 100 passengers on board were killed, as well as four people in the hotel. Four other people sustained slight injuries.

In the wake of the disaster, the entire Concorde fleet was grounded. It returned to service on 7 November 2001, following the implementation of various modifications to the airframe, but due to limited commercial success, especially in the wake of the September 11 attacks, Concorde aircraft were finally retired by Air France in May 2003 and by British Airways in November of the same year.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft involved was a 25-year-old Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde (registration F-BTSC, serial number 203). It was powered by four Rolls-Royce Olympus 593/610 turbojet engines, each of which was equipped with reheat. The aircraft&#x27;s last scheduled repair had taken place on 21 July 2000, four days before the accident; no problems were reported during the repair. At the time of the crash, the aircraft had flown for 11,989 hours and had made 4,873 take-off and landing cycles.

The cockpit crew consisted of the following:
* Captain Christian Marty (age 54), who had been with Air France since 1967. He had 13,477 flight hours, including 317 hours on the Concorde. Marty had also flown the Boeing 727, 737, Airbus A300, A320, and A340 aircraft.
* First officer Jean Marcot (50), who had been with Air France since 1971 and had 10,035 flight hours, with 2,698 of them on the Concorde. He had also flown the Aérospatiale N 262, Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris, Sud Aviation Caravelle and Airbus A300 aircraft.
* Flight engineer Gilles Jardinaud (58), who had been with Air France since 1968. He had 12,532 flight hours, of which 937 were on the Concorde aircraft. Jardinaud had also flown the Sud Aviation Caravelle, Dassault Falcon 20, Boeing 727, 737, and 747 (including the -400 variant) aircraft.

==Accident==
The wind at the airport was light and variable that day, and was reported to the cockpit crew as an tailwind as they lined up on runway 26R.
At 16:38 CEST (14:38 UTC), five minutes before the Concorde departed, Continental Airlines Flight 55, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, took off from the same runway for Newark International Airport and lost a titanium alloy strip that was part of the engine cowl, identified as a wear strip about long, wide, and thick. The DC-10 was not seriously affected by this. At 16:42, the Concorde ran over this piece of debris during its take-off run while the aircraft was at a speed of 185 mph (300 km/h), cutting the right-front tyre (tyre No 2) of its left main wheel bogie and sending a large chunk of tyre debris () into the underside of the left wing at an estimated speed of . It did not directly puncture any of the fuel tanks, but it sent out a pressure shockwave that ruptured the number 5 fuel tank at its weakest point, just ahead of the left landing gear well. Leaking fuel gushing out from the bottom of the wing was most likely ignited either by an electric arc in the landing gear bay (debris cutting the landing gear wire) or through contact with hot parts of the engine. Engines 1 and 2 both surged and lost all power, likely due to ingestion of hot gases (both engines) and tyre debris (engine 1 only), and then engine 1 slowly recovered over the next few seconds. A large plume of flame developed, and the flight engineer shut down engine 2 in response to a fire warning and the captain&#x27;s command.

Air traffic controller Gilles Logelin noticed the flames before the Concorde was airborne and informed the flight crew. However, the aircraft had passed V1 speed, at which point takeoff is considered unsafe to abort. The plane did not gain enough airspeed with the three remaining engines as damage to the landing gear bay door prevented the retraction of the undercarriage. The aircraft was unable to climb or accelerate, and its speed decayed during the course of its brief flight. The fire damaged the inner elevon of the left wing and it began to disintegrate, melted by the extremely high temperatures. Engine number 1 surged again, but did not fully recover, and the right wing lifted from the asymmetrical thrust, banking the aircraft to over 100 degrees. The crew reduced the power on engines three and four in an attempt to level the aircraft, but they lost control due to deceleration and the aircraft stalled. The aircraft struck the ground left wing low after a heading change of nearly 180°, crashing into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel. A video of the burning plane on takeoff and the aftermath of the crash was captured by a passenger in a passing truck.

The crew tried to divert to nearby Paris–Le Bourget Airport, but accident investigators stated that a safe landing would have been highly unlikely, given the aircraft&#x27;s flightpath. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded the last intelligible words in the cockpit (translated into English):

==Fatalities==

The flight was chartered by German company Peter Deilmann Cruises. The passengers were on their way to board the cruise ship MS &quot;Deutschland&quot; in New York for a 16-day cruise to Manta, Ecuador. They included German football manager Rudi Faßnacht and German trade union board member Christian Götz.

All the passengers and crew, and four employees of the Hotelissimo hotel were killed in the crash.

==Aftermath==
A few days after the crash, all Air France Concordes were grounded, pending an investigation into the cause of the crash and possible remedies. British Airways grounded their Concordes three weeks later for the same reason.

Air France&#x27;s Concorde operation had been a money-losing venture, and it is claimed that the aeroplane had been kept in service as a matter of national pride; British Airways claimed to make a profit on its Concorde operations. According to Jock Lowe, a Concorde pilot, until the crash of Air France Flight 4590 at Paris, the British Airways Concorde operation made a net average profit of about £30M (equivalent to £M in ) a year. Commercial service was resumed on 7 November 2001, after a £17M (£M today) safety improvement programme, until the type was retired between May (Air France) and October (British Airways), 2003.

This was the only fatal accident of Concorde&#x27;s entire service life.

==Investigation==
The official investigation was conducted by France&#x27;s accident investigation bureau, the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) and led by chief investigator Alain Bouillard.

Post-accident investigation revealed that the aircraft was over the maximum takeoff weight for ambient temperature and other conditions, and over the maximum structural weight, loaded so that the centre of gravity was aft of the take-off limit. Fuel transfer during taxiing left the number 5 wing tank 94 per cent full. A spacer normally keeps the left main landing gear in alignment, but it had not been replaced after recent maintenance; the BEA concluded that this did not contribute to the accident.

The final report was issued on 2002.

===Conclusions===
The BEA concluded that:
* The aircraft was overloaded by above the maximum safe takeoff weight. Any effect on takeoff performance from this excess weight was negligible.
* After reaching takeoff speed, the tyre of the number 2 wheel was cut by a metal strip (a wear strip) lying on the runway, which had fallen from the thrust reverser cowl door of the number 3 engine of a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off from the same runway five minutes previously. This wear strip had been replaced at Tel Aviv, Israel, during a C check on 11 June 2000, and then again at Houston, Texas, on 9 July 2000. The strip installed in Houston had been neither manufactured nor installed in accordance with the procedures as defined by the manufacturer.
* The aircraft was airworthy and the crew were qualified. The landing gear that later failed to retract had not shown serious problems in the past. Despite the crew being trained and certified, no plan existed for the simultaneous failure of two engines on the runway, as it was considered highly unlikely.
* Aborting the takeoff would have led to a high-speed runway excursion and collapse of the landing gear, which also would have caused the aircraft to crash.
* While two of the engines had problems and one of them was shut down, the damage to the plane&#x27;s structure was so severe that the crash would have been inevitable, even with the engines operating normally.

===Additional factors and alternative theories===
Former British Airways Concorde captain John Hutchinson said the fire on its own should have been &#x27;eminently survivable; the pilot should have been able to fly his way out of trouble&#x27;. Hutchinson believed this did not happen due to a series of operational errors and &#x27;negligence&#x27; by the maintenance department. According to a report in a British newspaper, by journalist David Rose, the crash had &quot;more than one contributing factor, most of which were avoidable.&quot; 

While examining the wreckage in a warehouse, investigators noticed that a spacer was missing from the bogie beam on the left-hand main landing gear. (It was later found in an Air France maintenance workshop.) This skewed the alignment of the landing gear because a strut was able to wobble in any direction with 3° of movement. The problem was exacerbated on the left gear&#x27;s three remaining tyres by the uneven fuel load. Drag marks left on the runway by the left rear landing wheels show the Concorde was veering to the left as it accelerated toward takeoff. Photographs in the BEA report showed a smashed steel landing light, clipped by the aircraft, parts of which were probably ingested by engine number 1.

According to Rose, former French Concorde pilot Jean-Marie Chauve and former Concorde flight engineer Michel Suaud spent six months preparing a 60-page report which was submitted to the investigating judge. They re-evaluated two factors that the BEA had found to be of negligible consequence to the crash, the unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and the loose landing gear. Chauve and Suaud gave detailed calculations, stating that without the retardation caused by the missing undercarriage spacer, the aircraft would have taken off 1684 metres from the start of the runway, before the point where the metal strip was located, although the BEA disputed this, saying the acceleration was normal.

At the start of the takeoff, the aircraft had 1.2 tonnes of extra fuel which should have been burnt during the aircraft&#x27;s taxi. Nineteen items of luggage, weighing some 500kg (0.5 tonnes) were loaded onto the aircraft at the last minute without being included in the aircraft&#x27;s manifest, giving the aircraft a weight of 186 tonnes, which exceeded the aircraft&#x27;s certified maximum structural weight by one tonne. A change in wind conditions created an 8 knot tailwind, which would have reduced the regulated takeoff weight to 180 tonnes, six tonnes below the actual aircraft weight. Rather than taking off from the other end of the runway, in order to take off into the wind, no change in takeoff direction occurred. The additional weight of the extra fuel in tank 11, the rearmost tank, plus the additional luggage shifted the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity rearwards, to beyond the safe operating limit of 54 per cent, set by the Concorde test pilots. Once the damaged forward tank 5 began to lose fuel, the centre of gravity moved even further rearward. 
At one point, it drifted toward a just-landed Air France Boeing 747 that was carrying then-French President Jacques Chirac (who was returning from the 26th G8 summit meeting in Okinawa, Japan). As the plane was about to leave the runway, with the aircraft rotated for takeoff, its speed was only 188 knots, 11 knots under the minimum recommended velocity. The flight engineer shut down engine number two at only 25 feet altitude. The procedure for shutting down an engine is to wait until stable flight at 400 feet is achieved, and then only on the command of the captain.

According to Mike Bannister, former British Airways Concorde Chief Pilot, there is evidence to suggest that the fuel tank transfer pump that fed the ruptured fuel tank, was left running, causing fuel to be pumped overboard and subsequently feeding the fire, and that the fuel tank was approximately 30% full at the time of crash rather than empty, if the pump had been off.

==Previous tyre incidents==
In November 1981, the American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) sent a letter of concern to the French BEA that included safety recommendations for Concorde. This communiqué was the result of the NTSB&#x27;s investigations of four Air France Concorde incidents during a 20-month period from to . The NTSB described those incidents as &quot;potentially catastrophic&quot;, because they were caused by blown tyres during takeoff. During its 27 years in service, Concorde had about 70 tyre- or wheel-related incidents, seven of which caused serious damage to the aircraft or were potentially catastrophic.
* 13 June 1979: The number 5 and 6 tyres blew out during a takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport. Fragments thrown from the tyres and rims damaged number 2 engine, punctured three fuel tanks, severed several hydraulic lines and electrical wires, and tore a large hole on the top of the wing over the wheel well area.
* 21 July 1979: Another blown tyre incident during takeoff from Dulles Airport. After that second incident the &quot;French director general of civil aviation issued an Airworthiness Directive and Air France issued a Technical Information Update, each calling for revised procedures. These included required inspection of each wheel and tyre for condition, pressure, and temperature prior to each takeoff. In addition, crews were advised that landing gear should not be raised when a wheel/tyre problem is suspected.&quot;
* August 1981: British Airways (BA) plane taking off from New York suffered a blow-out, damaging landing gear door, engine, and fuel tank.
* November 1985: Tyre burst on a BA plane leaving Heathrow, causing damage to the landing gear door and fuel tank. Two engines were damaged as a result of the accident.
* January 1988: BA plane leaving Heathrow lost 10 bolts from its landing gear wheel. A fuel tank was punctured.
* July 1993: Tyre burst on a BA plane during landing at Heathrow, causing substantial ingestion damage to the number 3 engine, damaging the landing gear and wing, and puncturing an empty fuel tank.
* October 1993: Tyre burst on a BA plane during taxi at Heathrow, puncturing wing, damaging fuel tanks, and causing a major fuel leak.

Because it is a tailless delta-wing aircraft, Concorde could not use the normal flaps or slats to assist takeoff and landing, and required a significantly higher air and tyre speed during the takeoff roll than an average airliner. That higher speed increased the risk of tyre burst during takeoff. Analysis of test results revealed that this occurring could release sufficient kinetic energy to cause the fuel tank to rupture. The analysis of impact energy considered a tyre piece of with a speed around . The piece could reach this speed by combination of rotation of the tyre on takeoff and the tyre burst.

==Modifications and revival==
The accident led to modifications to Concorde, including more-secure electrical controls, Kevlar lining to the fuel tanks, and specially developed burst-resistant tyres.

The crash of the Air France Concorde nonetheless proved to be the beginning of the end for the type. Just before service resumed, the September 11 attacks took place, resulting in a marked drop in passenger numbers, and contributing to the eventual end of Concorde flights. Air France stopped flights in , followed by British Airways five months later.

In June 2010, two groups attempted, unsuccessfully, to revive Concorde for &quot;Heritage&quot; flights in time for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The British Save Concorde Group, SCG, and French group Olympus 593 were attempting to obtain four Rolls-Royce Olympus engines from the Le Bourget Air and Space Museum.

==Criminal investigation==
In March 2005, French authorities began a criminal investigation of Continental Airlines, whose plane dropped the debris on the runway, and in September of the same year, Henri Perrier, the former chief engineer of the Concorde division at Aérospatiale at the time of the first test flight in 1969 and the programme director in the 1980s and early 1990s, was placed under formal investigation.

In March 2008, Bernard Farret, a deputy prosecutor in Pontoise, outside Paris, asked judges to bring manslaughter charges against Continental Airlines and two of its employees – John Taylor, the mechanic who replaced the wear strip on the DC-10, and his manager Stanley Ford – alleging negligence in the way the repair was carried out. Continental denied the charges, and claimed in court that it was being used as a scapegoat by the BEA. The airline suggested that the Concorde &quot;was already on fire when its wheels hit the titanium strip, and that around 20 first-hand witnesses had confirmed that the plane seemed to be on fire immediately after it began its take-off roll&quot;.

At the same time, charges were laid against Henri Perrier, head of the Concorde program at Aérospatiale; Jacques Hérubel, Concorde&#x27;s chief engineer; and Claude Frantzen, head of DGAC, the French airline regulator. It was alleged that Perrier, Hérubel, and Frantzen knew that the plane&#x27;s fuel tanks could be susceptible to damage from foreign objects, but nonetheless allowed it to fly.

The trial ran in a Parisian court from February to December 2010. Continental Airlines was found criminally responsible for the disaster. It was fined €200,000 ($271,628) and ordered to pay Air France . Taylor was given a 15-month suspended sentence, while Ford, Perrier, Hérubel, and Frantzen were cleared of all charges. The court ruled that the crash resulted from a piece of metal from a Continental jet that was left on the runway; the object punctured a tyre on the Concorde and then ruptured a fuel tank. The convictions were overturned by a French appeals court in November 2012, thereby clearing Continental (which had merged with United Airlines by then) and Taylor of criminal responsibility.

The Parisian court also ruled that Continental would have to pay 70% of any compensation claims. As Air France had paid out to the families of the victims, Continental could be made to pay its share of that compensation payout. The French appeals court, while overturning the criminal rulings by the Parisian court, affirmed the civil ruling and left Continental liable for the compensation claims.

==Legacy==

A monument in honour of the crash victims was established at Gonesse. The Gonesse monument consists of a piece of transparent glass with a piece of an aircraft wing jutting through. Another monument, a memorial surrounded with topiary planted in the shape of a Concorde, was established in 2006 at Mitry-Mory, just south of Charles de Gaulle Airport.

<doc id="408123" wikidata="Q140793" url="?curid=408123" title="Paycheck (novelette)">
<text>&quot;Paycheck&quot; is a science fiction novelette by American writer Philip K. Dick, written on July 31, 1952 and first published in the June 1953 issue of &quot;Imagination&quot;. The story was later made, with various alterations, into the film &quot;Paycheck&quot; in 2003 directed by John Woo and starring Ben Affleck.

==Plot summary==
Jennings, a talented electronic engineer, has accepted a secret contract with Rethrick Construction. The terms of the contract state that he will work for two years on a secret project after which he will have his memory of the time erased and will be paid an inordinate sum. It is implied that this type of working contract has replaced non-disclosure agreements in business and is commonplace. He wakes up to find that during his tenure he decided to forgo the payment of money and instead receive an envelope of trinkets. Rethrick states that this in itself is not unusual and that people often change their mind as to their method of payment during the course of contracts.

Soon after exiting the building he discovers that in the two years he has forgotten, America has become a police state—he is seized by the Security Police who want to know what Rethrick is doing. One of the trinkets he received as payment enables his escape from the police. Jennings soon realizes that the only way to secure his safety is to blackmail Rethrick as to who will be able to shield him from the government. Using several more of the trinkets, he is able to make his way back to Rethrick&#x27;s hidden facility. He has also realized that during his tenure at Rethrick Industries he worked on a machine that allowed people to view the future and the trinkets are part of a carefully crafted plan to ensure his survival.

When he finally enters Rethrick&#x27;s complex, it dawns on him that there is much more going on than the construction of an illegal device that can show the future. Rethrick is building an army to support a revolution which would free the country from the oppressive government. The story concludes with Jennings successfully blackmailing Rethrick into allowing him to join the company in a partner-like capacity.

The trinkets that Jennings received as payment are as follows:

*A length of fine wire (allows him to short out and open the door of a police car)
*A bus token (allows him to quickly board a bus and escape the Security Police)
*A ticket stub (tells him where Rethrick&#x27;s building is)
*A green strip of cloth (a worker&#x27;s armband, enabling him to enter Rethrick&#x27;s building)
*A code key (opens a rear exit from Rethrick&#x27;s building)
*Half of a broken poker chip (permits entry to a gambling den where he hides from both the Company and the police)
*A parcel receipt (permits access to material stored in a bank that allows him to blackmail Rethrick into protecting him from the government)

==Critical analysis==
Dick said of the story: &quot;How much is a key to a bus locker worth? One day it&#x27;s worth 25 cents, the next day thousands of dollars. In this story I got to thinking that there are times in our lives when having a dime to make a phone call spells the difference between life and death. Keys, small change, maybe a theater ticket -- how about a parking receipt for a Jaguar? All I had to do was link this idea up with time travel to see how the small and useless, under the wise eyes of a time traveler, might signify a great deal more. He would know when that dime might save your life. And, back in the past again, he might prefer that dime to any amount of money, no matter how large.&quot;

Critic Zack Handlen remarked, &quot;This is still early Dick, which means that while interesting concepts are introduced, and there’s some play with identity -- Jennings develops an overwhelming faith in the prescience of his past self, a faith which most people can’t ever have in their present versions, and by the end he’s even referring to that past guy as a separate person -- the primary focus is nabbing you and keeping you entertained. ... A solid piece of work all around.&quot;

<doc id="408127" wikidata="Q435203" url="?curid=408127" title="Katharine Graham">
<text>Katharine Meyer Graham (June 16, 1917 – July 17, 2001) was an American newspaper publisher. She led her family&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, from 1963 to 1991. Graham presided over the paper as it reported on the Watergate scandal, which eventually led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. She was one of the first 20th-century female publishers of a major American newspaper and the first woman elected to the board of the Associated Press.

Graham&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Personal History&quot;, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998.

==Early life==

Katharine Meyer was born on June 16, 1917 in New York City to Agnes (née Ernst) and Eugene Meyer. The Meyers were a wealthy family — her father was a financier and, from 1930-1933, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve; her grandfather was the financier Marc Eugene Meyer; and her great-grandfather, Rabbi Joseph Newmark, was also a businessman. Her father bought &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1933 at a bankruptcy auction. Her mother was a bohemian intellectual, art lover, and political activist. in the Republican Party, who shared friendships with people as diverse as Auguste Rodin, Marie Curie, Thomas Mann, Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, John Dewey and Saul Alinsky.

Her father was of Alsatian Jewish descent, and her mother was a Lutheran whose parents were German immigrants. Along with her four siblings, Katharine was baptized as a Lutheran but attended an Episcopal church. Her siblings included Florence, Eugene III (Bill), Ruth and Elizabeth (Biss) Meyer.

Meyer&#x27;s parents owned several homes across the country, but primarily lived between a mansion in Washington, D.C., and a large estate (later owned by Donald Trump) in Westchester County, New York. Meyer often did not see much of her parents during her childhood, as both traveled and socialized extensively; she was raised in part by nannies, governesses and tutors. Katharine endured a strained relationship with her mother. In her memoir, Katharine reports that Agnes could be negative and condescending towards her, which had a negative impact on Meyer&#x27;s self-confidence.

Her older sister Florence Meyer was a successful photographer and wife of actor Oscar Homolka. Her father&#x27;s sister, Florence Meyer Blumenthal, founded the Prix Blumenthal.

As a child, Meyer attended a Montessori school until the fourth grade when she enrolled at The Potomac School. She attended high school at The Madeira School (to which her father donated land for its new Virginia campus), then Vassar College before transferring to the University of Chicago. In Chicago, she made friends with a group that would discuss politics and ideas, and developed an interest in liberal ideas, against the growing fascism in Germany and Italy and sympathetic to the American labor movement.

==Career==
After graduation, Meyer worked for a short period at a San Francisco newspaper where, among other things, she helped cover a major strike by wharf workers. Meyer began working for the &quot;Post&quot; in 1938.

On June 5, 1940, Meyer was married to Philip Graham, a graduate of Harvard Law School and a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. They had a daughter, Lally Morris Weymouth, and three sons: Donald Edward Graham (born 1945), William Welsh Graham (1948-2017) and Stephen Meyer Graham (born 1952). She was affiliated as a Lutheran.

In his Los Angeles home, William Graham died at 69 on December 20, 2017. Like his father, Phil Graham, he died by suicide.

===&quot;The Washington Post&quot;===

Philip Graham became publisher of the &quot;Post&quot; in 1946, when Eugene Meyer handed over the newspaper to his son-in-law. Katharine recounts in her autobiography, &quot;Personal History&quot;, how she did not feel slighted by the fact her father gave the &quot;Post&quot; to Philip rather than her: &quot;Far from troubling me that my father thought of my husband and not me, it pleased me. In fact, it never crossed my mind that he might have viewed me as someone to take on an important job at the paper.&quot; Her father, Eugene Meyer, went on to become the head of the World Bank, but left that position only six months later. He was Chairman of the Washington Post Company until his death in 1959, when Philip Graham took that position and the company expanded with the purchases of television stations and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine.

===Social life and politics===
The Grahams were important members of the Washington social scene, becoming friends with John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Robert F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Robert McNamara, Henry Kissinger, Ronald Reagan, and Nancy Reagan among many others.

In her 1997 autobiography, Graham comments several times about how close her husband was to politicians of his day (he was instrumental, for example, in getting Johnson to be the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 1960), and how such personal closeness with politicians later became unacceptable in journalism. She tried to push lawyer Edward Bennett Williams into the role of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s, first commissioner mayor in 1967. The position went to Howard University-educated lawyer Walter Washington.

Graham was also known for a long-time friendship with Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway owned a substantial stake in the &quot;Post&quot;.

===Philip Graham&#x27;s illness and death===
Philip Graham dealt with alcoholism and mental illness throughout his marriage to Katharine. He had mood swings and often belittled her. On Christmas Eve in 1962, Katharine learned her husband was having an affair with Robin Webb, an Australian stringer for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. Philip declared that he would divorce Katharine for Robin, and he made motions to divide the couple&#x27;s assets.

At a newspaper conference in Phoenix, Arizona, Philip apparently had a nervous breakdown. He was sedated, flown back to Washington, and placed in the Chestnut Lodge psychiatric facility in nearby Rockville. On August 3, 1963, he committed suicide with a shotgun at the couple&#x27;s &quot;Glen Welby&quot; estate near Marshall in the Virginia horse country.

===Leadership of the &quot;Post&quot;===

Katharine Graham assumed the reins of the company and of the &quot;Post&quot; after Philip Graham&#x27;s suicide. She held the title of president and was &quot;de facto&quot; publisher of the paper from September 1963. She formally held the title of publisher from 1969 to 1979, and that of chairwoman of the board from 1973 to 1991. She became the first female Fortune 500 CEO in 1972, as CEO of the Washington Post Company. As the only woman to be in such a high position at a publishing company, she had no female role models and had difficulty being taken seriously by many of her male colleagues and employees. Graham outlined in her memoir her lack of confidence and distrust in her own knowledge. The convergence of the women&#x27;s movement with Graham&#x27;s control of the &quot;Post&quot; brought about changes in Graham&#x27;s attitude and also led her to promote gender equality within her company.

Graham hired Benjamin Bradlee as editor, and cultivated Warren Buffett for his financial advice; he became a major shareholder and something of an &quot;eminence grise&quot; in the company. Her son Donald was publisher from 1979 until 2000.

===Watergate===
Graham presided over the &quot;Post&quot; at a crucial time in its history. The &quot;Post&quot; played an integral role in unveiling the Watergate conspiracy which ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

Graham and editor Bradlee first experienced challenges when they published the content of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. When &quot;Post&quot; reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein brought the Watergate story to Bradlee, Graham supported their investigative reporting and Bradlee ran stories about Watergate when few other news outlets were reporting on the matter.

In conjunction with the Watergate scandal, Graham was the subject of one of the best-known threats in American journalistic history. It occurred in 1972, when Nixon&#x27;s attorney general, John Mitchell, warned reporter Carl Bernstein about a forthcoming article: &quot;Katie Graham&#x27;s gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that&#x27;s published.&quot; The &quot;Post&quot; published the quote, although Bradlee cut the words &quot;her tit&quot;. Graham later observed that it was &quot;especially strange of [Mitchell] to call me Katie, which no one has ever called me.&quot;

===Views regarding the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies ===
On November 16, 1988, Graham gave a speech titled &quot;Secrecy and the Press&quot; to a packed auditorium at CIA headquarters as part of that agency&#x27;s Office of Training and Education&#x27;s Guest Speaker series. In discussing the potential for press disclosures to affect national security, Graham said: &quot;We live in a dirty and dangerous world. There are some things the general public does not need to know, and shouldn&#x27;t. I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows.&quot;

==Other accomplishments and recognition==

Graham had strong links to the Rockefeller family, serving both as a member of the Rockefeller University council and as a close friend of the Museum of Modern Art, where she was honored as a recipient of the David Rockefeller Award for enlightened generosity and advocacy of cultural and civic endeavors.

At the University of Chicago, Katherine Graham has a dormhouse in Max Palevsky Residential Commons named after her. Every year on March 2 they celebrate &quot;Graham Day,&quot; honoring their namesake and her accomplishments.

Nora Ephron of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, who was at one point married to Carl Bernstein, raved about Graham&#x27;s autobiography. She found it an amazing story of how Graham was able to succeed in a male-dominated industry. “Am I making clear how extraordinary this book is?&quot; Ephron said. “She manages to rewrite the story of her life in such a way that no one will ever be able to boil it down to a sentence.”

<text>The National Film and Television School (NFTS) is a film, television and games school established in 1971 and based at Beaconsfield Studios in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, England. It is featured in the 2021 ranking by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; of the top 15 international film schools.

As of 2021 it had over 500 students and about a fifteen hundred a year on its short courses delivered in Beaconsfield and at its hubs in Glasgow, Leeds, and Cardiff. Beaconsfield Studios consists of film and television stages, animation, and production design studios, edit suites, sound post-production facilities, a music recording studio, and four dubbing theatres. The school completed an expansion in early 2017, adding a third cinema and a Television Studio.

The BBC stated that the NFTS was the &quot;leading centre of excellence for education in film and television programme making&quot;, and noted that it was &quot;relevant to the industry&#x27;s present and future needs&quot;. British Film Magazine once described the NFTS as being one of the few schools to come &quot;very, very close&quot; to guaranteeing a job in the film industry, and named its leader (Powell) a &quot;maverick&quot;. Filmmaking.net named it one of two films schools outside the U.S. which had such a high international reputation.

NFTS student films have been nominated for an Oscar three times in the last six years. Additionally, in 2017 NFTS graduation film, &quot;A Love Story&quot;, directed and co-written by Anushka Naanayakkara, won the British Short Animation BAFTA at the EE British Academy Film Awards, making it the fourth year in a row that NFTS students have picked up this accolade. This is the second consecutive year that two of NFTS students&#x27; graduation films competed for the same prize, with &quot;A Love Story&quot; up against &quot;The Alan Dimension&quot; directed and co-written by Jac Clinch. NFTS student films are regularly selected for the top film festivals around the world. In 2016–17 highlights included selections at Cannes and Annecy Animation Festival and top prizes in nearly all the Royal Television Society categories for which they are eligible.

In 2018, the school was the recipient of the BAFTA Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award at the 71st British Academy Film Awards.

==History==
The National Film School opened in 1971, the work of four years of planning to create an institution to train personnel for the British film industry. The Department of Education and Science had in 1967 recommended the creation of a national film school for the UK, and in 1969 an inquiry led by Lord Lloyd of Hampstead began to develop plans. Colin Young CBE became the founding director in 1971, a post he held for more than 2 decades, at a time when the school produced alumni including Bill Forsyth, Terence Davies, Julien Temple, Beeban Kidron, and Nick Park.

In 2016, the NFTS announced it had received funding to increase the capacity of its site in Beaconsfield including a &#x27;4K Digital Content Production Training Studio&#x27; (a refit of the 1960s TV studio) and the addition of a number of new MA and diploma courses including Directing &amp; Producing Natural History &amp; Science; Production Technology; Marketing for Film, TV &amp; Games; Graphics &amp; Titles for Television &amp; Film and Creative Business for Entrepreneurs &amp; Executives. In April 2017, it was announced that Nik Powell was to step down as Director of the school, with Jon Wardle succeeding him in the role.

The NFTS holds yearly graduation shows at the Picturehouse Central in Soho, and they were previously held at the BFI Southbank (formerly known as the National Film Theatre). These are highly selective and invite-only events which showcase the students&#x27; projects to scouts and industry professionals, ensuring that the students receive maximum exposure.

==Awards and nominations==

Alumni of the National Film and Television School have gone on to win Oscars, BAFTAs and Emmys as well as film festival prizes from around the world. In the last 6 years student films &quot;The Confession&quot; (2011), &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; (2013), &quot;The Bigger Picture&quot; (2015) have gone on to be nominated for three Oscars, and the graduation film &quot;A Love Story&quot; won the 2017 BAFTA for Best Short Animation, the fourth year in a row an NFTS animation has won the category.

In 2013 the NFTS graduation film &quot;Miss Todd&quot; won the Student Academy Award for Best Foreign Film presented by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. This marked the sixth time the NFTS had won in this category, more than any other Film School outside of the United States. In 2016, The National Film and Television School once again affirmed its place as the number one international film school by winning accolades in all three categories in the CILECT Prize, the global film school awards. The NFTS won &quot;Best Documentary&quot; for &quot;The Archipelago&quot;, &quot;Best Animation&quot; for &quot;Edmond&quot; and was awarded second prize in the &quot;Fiction&quot; category for &quot;Patriot&quot;.

==Facilities==

The school&#x27;s facilities were expanded in 2008 with the addition of new teaching spaces, public spaces and a new cinema, designed by Glenn Howells Architects. Upon its completion in 2008, the strikingly modern three-story building (see photo above) won a coveted RIBA prize. In June 2009 it was formally named The Oswald Morris Building in honour of veteran cinematographer Ossie Morris.

Two new buildings and one refurbished building opened in January 2017. This included the refurbishment of the 4K Digital Content Production Training Studio, located in the original 1960s TV studio which was completely refurbished with state-of-the-art equipment. In July 2017 this building was named the &quot;Sky Studios at the NFTS&quot; building, with the Production Galleries named &quot;The Sony Gallery&quot;. This studio is primarily used by the &quot;Camera, Sound &amp; Vision Mixing for Television Production&quot; diploma course and the &quot;Directing and Producing Television Entertainment&quot; MA course.

Inside the &quot;Channel 4 Rose Building&quot;, there are new facilities for the &quot;Games Design and Development&quot; and &quot;Digital Effects&quot; MA courses, as well as an extra cinema, café and incubation space to enable graduates to start new businesses and accommodate new ground-breaking courses, enhancing the NFTS&#x27; already diverse programme.

A new teaching block on the north of the site houses a new studio, edit suites, dedicated suites for the &quot;Sound Design&quot; MA and &quot;Graphics and Titles for Film and Television&quot; diploma courses, as well as multi-purpose teaching spaces.

There are four dedicated stages on site:
* Stage 1 (Main Stage) – (approx.) – traditional wooden floor film stage with permanent scenic cloth
* Studio 2 (TV Studio) – (approx.) – concrete resin floor television studio
* Stage 3 (Rehearsal Stage) – (approx.) – traditional wooden floor film stage
* Stage 4 (Teaching Block Stage) – (approx.) – resin floor multi-purpose stage

There are also a number of dedicated spaces for animation and music recording.

==Funding==

Until its repeal in 1986, the school was funded partly through a tax on cinema ticket sales known as the Eady Levy, named after then UK Treasury official Sir Wilfred Eady. The NFTS has since been funded by the UK Government, via (today) the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the television and film industries.

Key Partner Sponsors include the Film Distributors&#x27; Association and the UK Cinema Association in addition to the main UK terrestrial and satellite broadcasting companies BBC, Channel 4, Sky, and ITV. In addition, a large number of public and private donors fund scholarships to assist British students.

Postgraduate students from the UK can now apply for a loan to help with their studies at any UK university including the NFTS via the Student Loans Company.

<doc id="408130" wikidata="Q889791" url="?curid=408130" title="List of Thai monarchs">
<text>The succession of Thai monarchs began with Si Inthrathit at the establishment of the first Thai kingdom in 1238. With brief interruptions, 55 monarchs have ruled over four successive kingdoms, the current monarch being Vajiralongkorn (Rama X) of the Chakri dynasty.

==Titles and naming conventions==

In the Sukhothai Kingdom, the monarch used the title &quot;Pho Khun&quot; (), and monarchs who reigned over the period of decline after Ram Khamhaeng the Great used the title &quot;Phraya&quot; ().

In the Ayutthaya Kingdom and afterward, &quot;thanandon&quot;, the system of Thai royal titles, determines the style of the monarch&#x27;s full regnal name (which includes the title), consisting of two interconnected parts:
*The first part is the title &quot;Phra Bat Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua&quot; (, &#x27;His Majesty the King&#x27;). The title is split by the regnal name, written between &quot;Phra&quot; and &quot;Chao&quot;. If the monarch was not formally crowned, &quot;Phra Bat&quot; is omitted. If the monarch ruled as a tributary or was usurped, &quot;Somdet&quot; may be omitted.
**Sometimes, &quot;Chao Yu Hua&quot; is fully omitted. Other times, only &quot;Yu Hua&quot; is omitted, in which case &quot;Chao&quot; follows the remaining components of the title and precedes the regnal name.
*The second part is the regnal name, of which only a portion may be used to commonly refer to the monarch. It may differ from their birth name, their name as &quot;uparaja&quot; (viceroy), or their posthumous name and/or historical style. This list refers to monarchs by the names most often used by traditional historians.

Western nations referred to the monarch as the &quot;King of Siam&quot; (), regardless of Thai titles, since the initiation of relations in the 16th century. Mongkut (Rama IV) was the first monarch to adopt the title when the name &quot;Siam&quot; was first used in an international treaty. When the kingdom&#x27;s name was changed to Thailand, the monarch&#x27;s Western title changed accordingly.

==Sukhothai Kingdom (1238–1438)==

Tai peoples migrated into mainland Southeast Asia in the 8th–10th centuries. In the years after, Northern Thai groups established &quot;mueang&quot; that evolved into larger states, such as Ngoenyang. However, it was not until the decline of the Khmer Empire in the 13th century that a Central Thai kingdom politically and culturally related to modern Thailand was first founded.

===Phra Ruang dynasty (1238–1438)===
The Phra Ruang dynasty was the only royal lineage that ruled over the Sukhothai Kingdom, the first Central Thai state. Established by Si Inthrathit in 1238, who declared independence from the Khmer Empire, the dynasty laid the foundations for Thai society. Under Ram Khamhaeng the Great, the initial Thai script was invented and Therāvada Buddhism was established as the state religion.

The dynasty is named after the &quot;Traiphum Phra Ruang&quot;, a Buddhist cosmology book written by Maha Thammaracha I. During his reign, the kingdom was invaded by Ayutthaya, a neighboring Thai state, becoming a tributary during the reign of Maha Thammaracha II.

In the Sukhothai Kingdom, the monarch ruled from the city of Sukhothai, while the heir presumptive would occasionally be named uparaja, or viceroy, and ruled in Si Satchanalai. In 1438, Ayutthaya annexed Sukhothai at the death of Maha Thammaracha IV when Borommarachathirat II of Ayutthaya named his son Prince Ramesuan uparaja. In Ayutthaya, the tradition would evolve into the Front Palace system.

==Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351–1767)==

The Ayutthaya Kingdom was a result of a unification between two states: the Kingdom of Suphannaphum (Suphanburi) and the Kingdom of Lavo. Though the Kingdom of Lavo was originally a Mon kingdom, the migration of the Tai peoples into the Chao Phraya basin replaced the original Mons, consequently becoming the governors of these regions. This resulted in the capital moving from Lavapura (Lopburi) and Suphannaphum (Suphanburi) to Ayodhya (Old Ayutthaya), a new capital. Later on, the Kingdom of Nakhon si Thammarat came under the influence of Ayutthaya after seceding from Sukhothai, and Sukhothai losing influence and coming under Ayutthayan influence.

This conflict would last long into the history of Ayutthaya Kingdom, where families from the four major regional kingdoms vie over the throne of the kingdom. These kingdoms are: Kingdom of Nakhon Si Thammarat, Kingdom of Sukhothai, Kingdom of Lavo, and Kingdom of Suphannaphum. The Kingdom of Sukhothai was integrated into the Kingdom of Ayutthaya along with its noble famlies.

===Pre-Ayutthaya era (Ayodhya period)===
===1st Uthong dynasty (1351–1370)===
===1st Suphannaphum dynasty (1370–1388)===

As previously mentioned, the kingdom of Ayutthaya was the result of the unification between two federations: Lavo and Suphannaphum. The ruling dynasty of Lavo gave rise to the Uthong Dynasty, in which the Suphannaphum dynasty came from the Suphannaphum federation. This federation held significant influence within the kingdom leading them to take control of the throne in 1310. 


===2nd Uthong dynasty (1388–1409)===
===2nd Suphannaphum dynasty (1409–1569)===
===Sukhothai dynasty (1569–1629)===
===Prasat Thong dynasty (1629–1688)===
===Ban Phlu Luang dynasty (1688–1767)===
==Thonburi Kingdom (1767–1782)==

===Thonburi dynasty (1767–1782)===
==Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782–present)==

===Chakri dynasty (1782–present)===

The Maastricht Rebellion was a major event of John Major&#x27;s troubled second term as Prime Minister (1992–1997). Major&#x27;s party had a small majority, thus giving the relatively small number of rebels disproportionate influence: for example, there were 22 rebels on the second reading of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill in May 1992, and the government&#x27;s majority at the time was only 18.

The rebellion had the support of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former Party Chairman Norman Tebbit.

==Significant events in the rebellion==

At the height of the rebellion, the 1993 Christchurch by-election was held, where a Conservative majority of 23,000 was turned into a Liberal Democrat majority of 16,000. Conservative showings in opinion polls were as low as 23%. John Major threatened the rebels with a general election (despite one only being held a year earlier).

The Labour Party brought in MPs who had just had surgery and others who had suffered heart attacks - the stretcher vote - to vote in the House of Commons, in an effort to bring the government down. The loyalists and rebels in the Conservative Party also brought in their own stretcher vote; for example, Bill Cash organised for one MP (Bill Walker), who was seriously ill, to fly from Scotland secretly, then hid him at the rebels&#x27; headquarters in Great College Street, before, with Labour connivance, hiding him in the family room of the Commons so that the Conservative whips would not know; the government consequently lost a vote.

At Third Reading, on 20 May 1993, the Labour whip was to abstain. Despite this, 66 Labour MPs chose to vote against the Bill, while five (Andrew Faulds, John Home Robertson, Calum MacDonald, Giles Radice and Brian Sedgemore) supported the Government. The Bill passed Third Reading 292–112.

On 22 July 1993, on a Labour amendment to postpone incorporation of the Treaty until the Government adopted the 27th Amendment thereto (the Protocol on Social Policy or &quot;Social Chapter&quot;), the government tied 317–317 against the combined forces of some of the rebels, the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and others. The tie was broken by Speaker Betty Boothroyd&#x27;s casting a &#x27;no&#x27; vote (the Speaker casting her vote in accordance with Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule not to create a majority where none exists), though it later transpired that an extra &#x27;aye&#x27; had been counted by mistake and both Boothroyd&#x27;s and the erroneous vote were later expunged and the result deemed a 317-316 vote against. The remaining rebels (who had abstained on the amendment) then joined their colleagues to defeat the main take-note motion 324–316.

On the following day, it emerged, on inspection of the Division List, that the Government Whip and teller of the Opposition votes Irvine Patnick had failed to notice an overcount of one vote for the Labour amendment. Had he done so, it would have meant a clear win without a reliance being placed on the Speaker. On the next day (Friday) the government tabled a reworded motion to its predecessor, seeking the confidence of the House in their policy on the Social Chapter instead of merely &quot;taking note&quot; thereof. As a result, the Government easily won the substantive question by 339–299. Had the government lost this motion of confidence, a dissolution would have been requested and probably granted.

Bill Cash set-up the European Foundation to fund legal challenges to the government. Opposition to Maastricht led to the foundation of the Anti-Federalist League which ultimately led to the creation of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). Certain rebels later went on to join that political party, such as Christopher Gill and Richard Body, with Roger Knapman serving as their leader from 2002 to 2006.

The Maastricht rebels continued to harass the government on European issues, coming close to bringing the Government down three times. They repeatedly called Major&#x27;s bluff on an early dissolution of Parliament. On 23 November 1994, Nicholas Budgen asked him whether he had spoken to the Queen about dissolving Parliament. On 25 November 1994, Christopher Gill stated he would sooner resign as a Conservative than vote for the Bill. All those Conservatives who rebelled over the EC Finance Bill on 28 November 1994 had the Conservative whip withdrawn.

Deselection was threatened, so those Conservative MPs would not be able to stand at the next election, although at that time it was mostly a decision for the party members in their Constituency Association. Budgen summed the attitude of the rebels up with this quote: &quot;It would be my general feeling that the transference of power to Europe was so important a matter as to require a vote against any organisation and any party that wished to transfer that power.&quot; In 1995, Major called an early leadership election to attempt to reimpose his authority on the party, and won. However, the infighting continued, and the Conservatives were heavily defeated in the general election of May 1997.

==Changes to party rules since 1997==

After the Conservatives&#x27; catastrophic defeat at the 1997 election, blamed in part on the embarrassment caused by the open rebelliousness and infighting of elements in the party, changes were made to the party&#x27;s procedures to reduce the freedom of backbench MPs to rebel. Local constituency associations are now permitted to select as candidates only members of the approved party list or MPs with the whip.

The party leadership could therefore require a rebellious MP (or an MP involved in a scandal) to be deselected as a candidate by removing his or her name from the Candidates&#x27; List or by removing the whip as was done to Howard Flight at the 2005 general election. Local members who refuse to obey the instructions of Conservative Central Office can have their Association suspended (put on &quot;Special Measures&quot;), as was done to the Slough Association at that election when they refused to deselect their candidate.

<text>The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) is a standards setting body which publishes specifications, test protocols, and guidelines that are used in highway design and construction throughout the United States. Despite its name, the association represents not only highways but air, rail, water, and public transportation as well.

Although AASHTO sets transportation standards and policy for the United States as a whole, AASHTO is not an agency of the federal government; rather it is an organization of the states themselves. Policies of AASHTO are not federal laws or policies, but rather are ways to coordinate state laws and policies in the field of transportation.

== Purpose ==
The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) was founded on December 12, 1914. Its name was changed to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials on November 13, 1973. The name change reflects a broadened scope to cover all modes of transportation, although most of its activities are still specific to highways.

While AASHTO is not a government body, it does possess quasi-governmental powers in the sense that the organizations that supply its members customarily obey most AASHTO decisions.

== Membership ==
The voting membership of AASHTO consists of the Department of Transportation of each state in the United States, as well as those of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.

The United States Department of Transportation has a non-voting associate membership.

== Publications ==
Some noteworthy AASHTO publications are:
* &quot;A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets&quot;, often called &quot;The Green Book&quot; because of the color of its cover. This book covers the functional design of roads and highways including such things as the layout of intersections, horizontal curves, and vertical curves.
* &quot;Standard Specifications for Transportation Materials and Methods of Sampling and Testing&quot;.
* &quot;AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications&quot;. This manual is the base bridge design manual that all DOTs use across the US.
* &quot;Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware&quot; (MASH), crash testing criteria for safety hardware devices for use on highways; it updates and replaces NCHRP Report 350.

In addition to its publications, AASHTO performs or cooperates in research projects. One such project is the AASHTO Road Test, which is a primary source of data used when considering transport policies and the structural design of roads. Much of AASHTO&#x27;s current research is performed by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) which is administered by the Transportation Research Board (TRB), a division of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

AASHTO re:source, formerly the AASHTO Materials Reference Laboratory (AMRL), accredits laboratories. Accreditation is often required to submit test results to state DOTs. For example, a contract for the construction of a highway bridge may require a minimum compressive strength for the concrete used. The contract will specify AASHTO Test Designation T 22, &quot;Compressive Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens,&quot; as the means of determining compressive strength. The laboratory performing T 22 will be required to be accredited in that test.

AASHTO coordinates the numbering of Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and U.S. Bicycle Routes.

== Standards ==
Current and withdrawn AASHTO standards include:

* AASHTO TP10: Standard Test Method for Determining the tensile strength and temperature at fracture of field or laboratory compacted bituminous mixtures by measuring the tensile load in a specimen which is cooled at a constant rate while being restrained from contraction.
* AASHTO T307: Standard Method of Test for Determining the Resilient Modulus of Soils and Aggregate Materials.
* AASHTO T321/TP4: Test Standard for Determining the Fatigue Life of Compacted Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending.
* AASHTO TP31: Standard Test Method for Determining the Resilient Modulus of Bituminous Mixtures by Indirect Tension
* AASHTO TP62: Standard Method of Test for Determining Dynamic Modulus of Hot-Mix Asphalt Concrete Mixtures
* AASHTO T321-03/TP8: Test Standard for Determining the Fatigue Life of Compacted Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending

<text>&quot;Is the glass half empty or half full?&quot;, and other similar expressions such as the adjectives glass-half-full or glass-half-empty, are idioms which contrast an optimistic and pessimistic outlook on a specific situation or on the world at large. &quot;Half full&quot; means optimistic and &quot;half empty&quot; means pessimistic. The origins of this idea are unclear, but it dates at least to the early 20th century. Josiah Stamp is often given credit for introducing it in a 1935 speech, but although he did help to popularize it, a variant regarding a car&#x27;s gas tank occurs in print with the optimism/pessimism connotations as early as 1929, and the glass-with-water version is mentioned simply as an intellectual paradox about the quantity of water (without reference to optimism/pessimism) as early as 1908.

<doc id="408157" wikidata="Q939066" url="?curid=408157" title="Kirshenbaum">
<text>Kirshenbaum , sometimes called ASCII-IPA or erkIPA, is a system used to represent the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) in ASCII. This way it allows typewriting IPA-symbols by regular keyboard. It was developed for Usenet, notably the newsgroups sci.lang and alt.usage.english. It is named after Evan Kirshenbaum, who led the collaboration that created it. The eSpeak open source software speech synthesizer uses the Kirshenbaum scheme.

==Comparison of Kirshenbaum with X-SAMPA==

The system uses almost all lower-case letters to represent the directly corresponding IPA character, but unlike X-SAMPA, has the notable exception of the letter &#x27;r&#x27;. A non-comprehensive list of sounds where the two systems use different characters:

==Kirshenbaum charts of consonants and vowels==
&quot;This chart is based on information provided in the Kirshenbaum specification. It may also be helpful to compare it to the SAMPA chart or X-SAMPA chart.&quot;

===Consonant chart===
The IPA consonant chart, for comparison, uses many symbols that are less widely supported:

===Vowel chart===
The IPA vowel chart, by comparison, uses many symbols that are less widely supported:
====Vowel modifiers and diacritics====
Modifiers and diacritics follow the symbol they modify.
Stress is indicated by codice_1 for primary stress, and codice_2 for secondary stress, placed before the stressed syllable.

==Background==
The Kirshenbaum system started developing in August 1992 through a usenet group, after &quot;being fed up with describing the sound of words by using other words&quot;.
It should be usable for both phonemic and narrow phonetic transcription.
* It should be possible to represent all symbols and diacritics in the IPA.
* The previous guideline notwithstanding, it is expected that (as in the past) most use will be in transcribing English, so where tradeoffs are necessary, decisions should be made in favor of ease of representation of phonemes which are common in English.
* The representation should be readable.
* It should be possible to mechanically translate from the representation to a character set which includes IPA. The reverse would also be nice.

The developers decided to use the existing IPA alphabet, mapping each &quot;segment&quot; to a single keyboard character, and adding extra ASCII characters optionally for IPA &quot;diacritics&quot;.

An early (1993), different set in ASCII was derived from the pronunciation guide in Merriam-Webster&#x27;s New Collegiate Dictionary, which uses straight letters to describe the sound.

Kirshenbaum&#x27;s document, &quot;Representing IPA phonetics in ASCII&quot;, is commonly used as an example of an &quot;IPA ASCII&quot; system.

The eSpeak software speech synthesizer uses the Kirshenbaum scheme to represent phonemes with ascii characters.

==Encoding==
IETF language tags have registered as a variant subtag identifying text as transcribed in this convention.

<doc id="408163" wikidata="Q2332337" url="?curid=408163" title="Knowle, West Midlands">
<text>Knowle is a large village situated 3 miles (5 km) east-southeast of the town of Solihull, in the county of the West Midlands, England. Knowle lies within the Arden area of the historic county boundaries of Warwickshire, and since 1974 it has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull. It lies 2.5 miles from the Warwickshire border and had a recorded population of 10,678.

Knowle is in the parliamentary constituency of Meriden and Solihull East.

== History ==
Knowle was formerly a chapelry, in 1866 Knowle became a civil parish, on 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished to form Solihull Urban, part also went to Balsall and Lapworth. In 1931 the parish had a population of 2982.

==Present day==
Knowle still retains a considerable village charm, despite being on the outer edge of the West Midlands conurbation. It is contiguous to the south with the similar-sized communities of Dorridge and Bentley Heath, both of which are mainly residential in nature. The affluent district of Copt Heath is a suburb of Knowle to the north, with Tilehouse Green to the south. The village is considered to be amongst the most prosperous areas in the entire English Midlands.

===Shops and businesses===
Knowle has many shops. Most of these are located on the High Street, though there are a number of side roads and a shopping precinct. Knowle Library is maintained by Solihull Council in a building called Chester House dating back to Tudor times. At the rear of the building a Knot garden has been restored. The small shopping area also has restaurants of all varieties, making Knowle a popular destination for dining out. In 2011 a Costa Coffee opened on the High Street. Tesco retains a medium-sized &#x27;Metro&#x27; store in St. John&#x27;s shopping precinct.

===Recreation===
Knowle is near to the Grand Union Canal which links Birmingham to London. Knowle Locks are a flight of five locks (originally six until around 1930) near the canal bridge on Kenilworth Road. Recreation areas include Knowle Park, which has a children&#x27;s play area, tennis courts, football field and plenty of open space. There is also another children&#x27;s playing field owned by the National Trust near Knowle Primary School, and in the smaller village of Bentley Heath, there is a newly refurbished park, near the highly rated school, of the same name. There is also Knowle F.C., Knowle Village Cricket Club who play in Division 2 of the Warwickshire Cricket League, after 3 promotions in three years, and the exclusive Copt Heath Golf Club. The Silhillians Sports Club is nearby, the home venue of Silhillians Rugby Union Football Club which is the home of Warwickshire Hockey as well as Old Silhillians Hockey Club.

There are also many clubs in the village for all ages. There are various Scout and Guide groups including a karate class and church groups. The Knowle Society exists to help maintain the village and its heritage. Knowle Local History Society also holds a wealth of historical information about the village and its people from very early times. Knowle also has drama groups and a Village Hall and Knowle and Dorridge Round Table meet locally.

===Housing and schools=== 
Knowle has two schools, a Church of England primary school with a nursery and a secondary school, Arden Academy, which also caters for Dorridge, Bentley Heath and Hockley Heath. In September 2006, a sixth form centre commenced with over 50 students. The project cost approximately £4 million and has attracted students from many of the surrounding schools. A new design and technology block called ‘The Smart Centre’ has also been recently completed with another similar building which has also recently been completed. They are considered to be well performing schools, even considering the advantaged catchment area.

The main church is a Church of England Parish Church and there is a United Reformed Church on Station Road. The Parish Church offers many services using modern equipment, the old Guild house and much newer St. John&#x27;s Hall.

The housing in Knowle is mainly detached or semi-detached with the occasional terraced street and some apartment blocks. More recently, developers have bought up housing for demolition and are building &quot;windfall developments&quot; of apartments on its outskirts. House prices are considerably higher than the national average due to the demand for housing in the highly affluent southeastern fringes of the West Midlands conurbation and high achieving schools.

==Community Groups==
The village has strong local community organisations, including the Knowle Society, a Neighbourhood Forum, Round Table, Lions, and several Scout groups.

===Neighbourhood Forum===
Knowle, Dorridge and Bentley Heath Neighbourhood Forum was formed in 2015 with the purpose of bringing together the people from the three adjoining villages to define how they would like to see the villages develop in the future. The Forum will collate the policies developed into a draft Neighbourhood Plan for the three villages during 2017, and subsequently arrange for a local referendum to create the Neighbourhood Plan as a statutory planning document for the area. The Forum is run entirely by volunteers, and by Spring 2017 had a membership of over 800.

==Transport==
The village lies on the A4141 road and is close to the M42 motorway. Knowle does not have its own railway station, but nearby Dorridge railway station, on the Chiltern Main Line, was previously known as &quot;Knowle and Dorridge&quot; and for a period just as&#x27; &#x27;Knowle&#x27; &#x27;. Another station lies a few miles north at Hampton-in-Arden on the Coventry-Birmingham (West Coast) line and Birmingham International railway station is nearby for express services to London Euston. Knowle is also close to Birmingham Airport and is linked to Solihull by bus services A3 and A3W operated by Landflight. Junction 5 of the M42 motorway runs a little over a mile from the western edge of the village.

The Grand Union Canal Birmingham Main Line lies to the east of Knowle, between Birmingham to the north and Leamington Spa to the south and east. A set of locks are named after the village. 

==Nearby places of interest==
Surrounding villages include Bentley Heath, Dorridge, Hampton-in-Arden, Balsall Common, Hockley Heath and Henley-in-Arden. To the northwest is Solihull and Birmingham, to the east Coventry, and to the south Warwick, Leamington Spa and, further afield, Stratford-upon-Avon.

<text>The eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), also known, particularly outside of the United States, as simply the grey squirrel, is a tree squirrel in the genus &quot;Sciurus&quot;. It is native to eastern North America, where it is the most prodigious and ecologically essential natural forest regenerator. Widely introduced to certain places around the world, the eastern gray squirrel in Europe, in particular, is regarded as an invasive species.

In Europe, &quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot; is included since 2016 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

==Distribution==
&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot; is native to the eastern and midwestern United States, and to the southerly portions of the central provinces of Canada. In the mid-1800s the population in the midwestern United States was described as being &quot;truly astonishing,&quot; but human predation and habitat destruction through deforestation resulted in drastic population reductions, to the point that the animal was almost absent from Illinois by 1900.

The native range of the eastern gray squirrel overlaps with that of the fox squirrel (&quot;Sciurus niger&quot;), with which it is sometimes confused, although the core of the fox squirrel&#x27;s range is slightly more to the west. The eastern gray squirrel is found from New Brunswick, through southwestern Quebec and throughout southern Ontario plus in southern Manitoba, south to East Texas and Florida. Breeding eastern gray squirrels are found in Nova Scotia, but whether this population was introduced or came from natural range expansion is not known.

A prolific and adaptable species, the eastern gray squirrel has also been introduced to, and thrives in, several regions of the western United States and in 1966, this squirrel was introduced onto Vancouver Island in Western Canada in the area of Metchosin, and has spread widely from there. They are considered highly invasive and a threat to both the local ecosystem and the native squirrel, the American red squirrel.

Overseas, eastern gray squirrels in Europe are a concern because they have displaced some of the native squirrels there. They have been introduced into Ireland, Britain, Italy, South Africa, and Australia (where it was extirpated by 1973).

In Ireland, the native squirrel – also colored red – the Eurasian red squirrel &quot;S. vulgaris&quot; – has been displaced in several eastern counties, though it still remains common in the south and west of the country. The gray squirrel is also an invasive species in Britain; it has spread across the country and has largely displaced the red squirrel. That such a displacement might happen in Italy is of concern, as gray squirrels might spread to other parts of mainland Europe.
===Fossil record===
&quot;S. carolinensis&quot; is known to have occurred at least 18 times throughout the North American Pleistocene fossil record, across eight different US states, with some fossils allegedly dating back as early as the late Irvingtonian period. Body size seems to have increased during the early to middle Holocene and then decreased to the present size seen today. 

A single fossil specimen (held and cataloged by South Carolina State Museum&#x27;s natural history collection as SC93.105.172–.174) is known from the Ardis local fauna site in Harleyville, South Carolina. This specimen consists of a partial humerus (.172) and two partial tibiae (.173, .174), which are anatomically indistinguishable from that of contemporary &quot;S. carolinensis&quot;. Surrounding fossil material from the site has been dated back to 18,940–18,530 years ago, during the Late Pleistocene (late Rancholabrean) epoch, and indicates that the site was likely a hardwood-conifer swamp during this time.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Sciurus&quot;, is derived from two Greek words, &quot;skia&quot; &#x27;shadow&#x27; and &quot;oura&quot; &#x27;tail&#x27;. This name alludes to the squirrel sitting in the shadow of its tail. The specific epithet, &quot;carolinensis&quot;, refers to the Carolinas, where the species was first recorded and where the animal is still extremely common. In the United Kingdom and Canada, it is simply referred to as the &quot;grey squirrel&quot;. In the US, &quot;eastern&quot; is used to differentiate the species from the western gray squirrel (&quot;Sciurus griseus&quot;).

==Characteristics==

The eastern gray squirrel has predominantly gray fur, but it can have a brownish color. It has a usual white underside as compared to the typical brownish-orange underside of the fox squirrel. It has a large bushy tail. Particularly in urban situations where the risk of predation is reduced, both white-colored and black-colored individuals are quite often found. The melanistic form, which is almost entirely black, is predominant in certain populations and in certain geographic areas, such as in large parts of southeastern Canada. Melanistic squirrels appear to exhibit a higher cold tolerance than the common gray morph; when exposed to −10 °C, black squirrels showed an 18% reduction in heat loss, a 20% reduction in basal metabolic rate, and an 11% increase to non-shivering thermogenesis capacity when compared to the common gray morph. The black coloration is caused by an incomplete dominant mutation of MC1R, where &quot;E+/E+&quot; is a wild type squirrel, &quot;E+/EB&quot; is brown-black, and &quot;EB/EB&quot; is black.

The head and body length is from , the tail from , and the adult weight varies between . They do not display sexual dimorphism, meaning there is no gender difference in size or coloration.

The tracks of an eastern gray squirrel are difficult to distinguish from the related fox squirrel and Abert&#x27;s squirrel, though the latter&#x27;s range is almost entirely different from the gray&#x27;s. Like all squirrels, the eastern gray shows four toes on the front feet and five on the hind feet. The hind foot-pad is often not visible in the track. When bounding or moving at speed, the front foot tracks will be behind the hind foot tracks. The bounding stride can be two to three feet long.

The dental formula of the eastern gray squirrel is 1023/1013 (upper teeth/lower teeth).

 × 2 = 22 total teeth.

Incisors exhibit indeterminate growth, meaning they grow consistently throughout life, and their cheek teeth exhibit brachydont (low-crowned teeth) and bunodont (having tubercles on crowns) structures.

=== Growth and ontogeny ===

Newborn squirrels are called kits, kittens, or pups. They weigh 13–18 grams at birth. They are born blind, entirely hairless, and pink with vibrissae present at birth. 7–10 days postpartum, the skin begins to darken, just before the juvenile pelage grows in. Lower incisors erupt 19–21 days postpartum, while upper incisors erupt after 4 weeks. Cheek teeth erupt during week 6. Eyes open after 21–42 days, and ears open 3–4 weeks postpartum. Weaning is initiated around 7 weeks postpartum, and is usually finished by week 10, followed by the loss of the juvenile pelage. Full adult body mass is achieved by 8–9 months after birth.

=== Diseases ===
Diseases such as typhus, plague, and tularemia are spread by eastern gray squirrels. If not properly treated, these diseases have the potential to kill squirrels. When bitten or exposed to bodily fluids, humans can contract these diseases. Also carried by eastern gray squirrels are parasites such as ringworm, fleas, lice, mites, and ticks which can kill their squirrel host. Their skin may become rough, blotchy, and prone to hair loss due to the mite parasite during the chilly winter months. The parasites are not transferred to people when these squirrels reside in attics or homes. A frequent illness spread by ticks is Lyme disease. Ticks can also spread Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It can result in damage to internal organs including the heart and kidney if not properly treated. An eastern gray squirrel is susceptible to diseases including fibromatosis and squirrelpox. A squirrel with fibromatosis, a virus-induced illness, may grow massive skin tumors all over the body. Blindness could result from a tumor that is located close to a squirrel&#x27;s eye.

== Behavior and ecology ==
Like many members of the family Sciuridae, the eastern gray squirrel is a scatter-hoarder; it hoards food in numerous small caches for later recovery. Some caches are quite temporary, especially those made near the site of a sudden abundance of food which can be retrieved within hours or days for reburial in a more secure site. Others are more permanent and are not retrieved until months later. Each squirrel is estimated to make several thousand caches each season. The squirrels have very accurate spatial memory for the locations of these caches, using distant and nearby landmarks to retrieve them. Smell is used partly to uncover food caches, and also to find food in other squirrels&#x27; caches. Scent can be unreliable when the ground is too dry or covered in snow.

Squirrels sometimes use deceptive behavior to prevent other animals from retrieving cached food. For example, they will pretend to bury the object if they feel that they are being watched. They do this by preparing the spot as usual, for instance, digging a hole or widening a crack, miming the placement of the food, while actually concealing it in their mouths, and then covering up the &quot;cache&quot; as if they had deposited the object. They also hide behind vegetation while burying food or hide it high up in trees (if their rival is not arboreal). Such a complex repertoire suggests that the behaviours are not innate, and imply theory of mind thinking.

The eastern gray squirrel is one of very few mammalian species that can descend a tree head-first. It does this by turning its feet so the claws of its hind paws are backward-pointing and can grip the tree bark.

Eastern gray squirrels build a type of nest, known as a drey, in the forks of trees, consisting mainly of dry leaves and twigs. The dreys are roughly spherical, about 30 to 60 cm in diameter and are usually insulated with moss, thistledown, dried grass, and feathers to reduce heat loss. Males and females may share the same nest for short times during the breeding season, and during cold winter spells. Squirrels may share a drey to stay warm. They may also nest in the attic or exterior walls of a house, where they may be regarded as pests, as well as fire hazards due to their habit of gnawing on electrical cables. In addition, squirrels may inhabit a permanent tree den hollowed out in the trunk or a large branch of a tree.

Eastern gray squirrels are crepuscular, or more active during the early and late hours of the day, and tend to avoid the heat in the middle of a summer day. They do not hibernate.

Eastern gray squirrels can breed twice a year, but younger and less experienced mothers normally have a single litter per year in the spring. Depending on forage availability, older and more experienced females may breed again in summer. In a year of abundant food, 36% of females bear two litters, but none will do so in a year of poor food. Their breeding seasons are December to February and May to June, though this is slightly delayed in more northern latitudes. The first litter is born in February or March, the second in June or July, though, again, bearing may be advanced or delayed by a few weeks depending on climate, temperature, and forage availability. In any given breeding season, an average of 61 – 66% of females bear young. If a female fails to conceive or loses her young to unusually cold weather or predation, she re-enters estrus and has a later litter. Five days before a female enters estrus, she may attract up to 34 males from up to 500 meters away. Eastern gray squirrels exhibit a form of polyandry, in which the competing males will form a hierarchy of dominance, and the female will mate with multiple males depending on the hierarchy established.
Normally, one to four young are born in each litter, but the largest possible litter size is eight. The gestation period is about 44 days. The young are weaned around 10 weeks, though some may wean up to six weeks later in the wild. They begin to leave the nest after 12 weeks, with autumn born young often wintering with their mother. Only one in four squirrel kits survives to one year of age, with mortality around 55% for the following year. Mortality rates then decrease to around 30% for following years until they increase sharply at eight years of age.

Rarely, eastern gray females can enter estrus as early as five and a half months old, but females are not normally fertile until at least one year of age. Their mean age of first estrus is 1.25 years. The presence of a fertile male will induce ovulation in a female going through estrus. Male eastern grays are sexually mature between one and two years of age. Reproductive longevity for females appears to be over 8 years, with 12.5 years documented in North Carolina. These squirrels can live to be 20 years old in captivity, but in the wild live much shorter lives due to predation and the challenges of their habitat. At birth, their life expectancy is 1–2 years, an adult typically can live to be six, with exceptional individuals making it to 12 years.

===Communication===

As in most other mammals, communication among eastern gray squirrel individuals involves both vocalizations and posturing. The species has a quite varied repertoire of vocalizations, including a squeak similar to that of a mouse, a low-pitched noise, a chatter, and a raspy &quot;mehr mehr mehr&quot;. Other methods of communication include tail-flicking and other gestures, including facial expressions. Tail flicking and the &quot;kuk&quot; or &quot;quaa&quot; call are used to ward off and warn other squirrels about predators, as well as to announce when a predator is leaving the area. Squirrels also make an affectionate coo-purring sound that biologists call the &quot;muk-muk&quot; sound. This is used as a contact sound between a mother and her kits and in adulthood, by the male when he courts the female during mating season. The use of vocal and visual communication has been shown to vary by location, based on elements such as noise pollution and the amount of open space. For instance, populations living in large cities generally rely more on the visual signals, due to the generally louder environment with more areas without much visual restriction. However, in heavily wooded areas, vocal signals are used more often due to the relatively lower noise levels and a dense canopy restricting visual range.

=== Habitat ===

In the wild, eastern gray squirrels can be found inhabiting large areas of mature, dense woodland ecosystems, generally covering 100 acres (40 hectares) of land. These forests usually contain large mast-producing trees such as oaks and hickories, providing ample food sources. Oak-hickory hardwood forests are generally preferred over coniferous forests due to the greater abundance of mast forage. This is why they are found only in parts of eastern Canada which do not contain boreal forest (i.e. they are found in some parts of New Brunswick, in southwestern Quebec, throughout southern Ontario and in southern Manitoba).

Eastern gray squirrels generally prefer constructing their dens upon large tree branches and within the hollow trunks of trees. They also have been known to take shelter within abandoned bird nests. The dens are usually lined with moss plants, thistledown, dried grass, and feathers. These perhaps provide and assist in the insulation of the den, used to reduce heat loss. A cover to the den is usually built afterwards. Eastern gray squirrels also use dens for protection from prey and to help them look after their young. Young survive 40 percent less if they lived in a leaf nest compared to a den. Squirrels tend to claim 2-3 dens at the same time. Canopy and midstory trees are used by squirrels to hide from predators such as hawks and owls. The typical squirrel ranges over and tends to be smaller where more of them are found.

Close to human settlements, eastern gray squirrels are found in parks and back yards of houses within urban environments and in the farmlands of rural environments.

=== Ecosystem ===
Eastern gray squirrels forage tree seeds and disperse them through seed-caching. They may also contribute to the distribution of truffle fungal spores when they eat truffles. They are an important prey source and parasitic host for other animals. 

===Predation===
Eastern gray squirrels predators include hawks, weasels, raccoons, bobcats, foxes, domestic and feral cats, snakes, owls, and dogs. Their primary predators are hawks, owls, and snakes. Raccoons and weasels may consume a squirrel depending on where it lives in the United States. Rattlesnakes eat squirrels in California as they are searching for food in a heavy forest. The squirrel is susceptible to being eaten by foxes in the eastern region of the United States.

In its introduced range in South Africa, it has been preyed on by African harrier-hawks. When a predator is approaching the eastern gray squirrel, other squirrels will inform the squirrel of the predator by sending an acoustic signal to let the squirrel know. The speed of a squirrel makes it hard for it to be captured by the predators.

== Diet ==
Eastern gray squirrels eat a range of foods, such as tree bark, tree buds, flowers, berries, many types of seeds and acorns, walnuts, and other nuts, like hazelnuts (see picture) and some types of fungi found in the forests, including fly agaric mushrooms and truffles. They can cause damage to trees by tearing the bark and eating the soft cambial tissue underneath. In Europe, sycamore and beech suffer the greatest damage. Mast-bearing gymnosperms such as cedar, hemlock, pine, and spruce are another food source, as well as angiosperms such as hickory, oak, and walnut. These trees produce important foods for them during the spring and fall months. The squirrels will vary the species they forage from depending on the season. The squirrels also raid gardens for wheat, tomatoes, corn, strawberries, and other garden crops. Sometimes they eat the tomato seeds and discard the rest. On occasion, eastern gray squirrels also prey upon insects, frogs, small rodents including other squirrels, and small birds, their eggs, and young. They also gnaw on bones, antlers, and turtle shells – likely as a source of minerals scarce in their normal diet. In urban and suburban areas, these squirrels scavenge for food in trash bins. However, these foods are not safe for them to digest because they include sugar, fat, as well as additives that can make them sick. Eastern gray squirrels are sometimes mistakenly thought to be herbivores, but they are omnivores.

Eastern gray squirrels have a high enough tolerance for humans to inhabit residential neighborhoods and raid bird feeders for millet, corn, and sunflower seeds. Some people who feed and watch birds for entertainment also intentionally feed seeds and nuts to the squirrels for the same reason. However, in the UK eastern gray squirrels can take a significant proportion of supplementary food from feeders, preventing access and reducing use by wild birds. Attraction to supplementary feeders can increase local bird nest predation, as eastern gray squirrels are more likely to forage near feeders, resulting in increased likelihood of finding nests, eggs and nestlings of small passerines.

== Introductions and impact ==

The eastern gray squirrel is an introduced species in a variety of locations in western North America: in western Canada, to the southwest corner of British Columbia and to the city of Calgary, Alberta; in the United States, to the states of Washington and Oregon and, in California, to the city of San Francisco and the San Francisco Peninsula area in San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, south of the city. It has become the most common squirrel in many urban and suburban habitats in western North America, from north of central California to southwest British Columbia.

By the turn of the 20th century, breeding populations of the eastern gray squirrel had been introduced into South Africa, Ireland, Italy, Australia (extirpated by 1973), and the United Kingdom.

In South Africa, though exotic, it is not usually considered an invasive species owing to its small range (only found in the extreme southwestern part of the Western Cape, going north as far as the small farming town of Franschhoek), as well because it inhabits urban areas and places greatly affected by humans, such as agricultural areas and exotic pine plantations. Here, it mostly eats acorns and pine seeds, although it will take indigenous and commercial fruit, as well. Even so, it is unable to use the natural vegetation (fynbos) found in the area, a factor which has helped to limit its spread. It does not come into contact with native squirrels due to geographic isolation (a native tree squirrel, &quot;Paraxerus cepapi&quot;, is found only in the savanna regions in the northeast of the country) and different habitats.

Gray squirrels were first introduced to Britain in the 1870s, as fashionable additions to estates. In 1921 it was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; that the Zoological Society of London had released eastern greys to breed at liberty in Regents Park:
They spread rapidly across England, and then became established in both Wales and parts of southern Scotland. On mainland Britain, they have almost entirely displaced native red squirrels. Larger than red squirrels and capable of storing up to four times more fat, gray squirrels are better able to survive winter conditions. They produce more young and can live at higher densities. Gray squirrels also carry the squirrelpox virus, to which red squirrels have no immunity. When an infected gray squirrel introduces squirrelpox to a red squirrel population, its decline is 17–25 times greater than through competition alone.

In Ireland, the displacement of red squirrels has not been as rapid because only a single introduction occurred, in County Longford. Schemes have been introduced to control the population of gray squirrels in Ireland to encourage the native red squirrels. Eastern gray squirrels have also been introduced to Italy, and the European Union has expressed concern that they will similarly displace the red squirrel from parts of the European continent.
=== As food ===
Gray squirrels were eaten in earlier times by Native Americans and their meat is still popular with hunters across most of their range in North America. Today, it is still available for human consumption and is occasionally sold in the United Kingdom. However, physicians in the United States have warned that squirrel brains should not be eaten, because of the risk that they may carry Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.

=== Displacement of red squirrels ===

In Britain and Ireland, the eastern gray squirrel is not regulated by natural predators, other than the European pine marten, which is generally absent from England and Wales. This has aided its rapid population growth and has led to the species being classed as a pest and it is now illegal to release captured eastern grey squirrels back into the wild in the UK. Measures are being devised to reduce its numbers, including a campaign starting in 2006 named &quot;Save Our Squirrels&quot; using the slogan &quot;Save a red, eat a grey!&quot; which attempted to re-introduce squirrel meat in to the local market, with celebrity chefs promoting the idea, cookbooks introducing recipes containing squirrel and the Forestry Commission providing a regular supply of squirrel meat to British restaurants, factories and butchers. In areas where relict populations of red squirrels survive, such as the islands of Anglesey, Brownsea and the Isle of Wight, programs exist to eradicate gray squirrels and prevent them from reaching these areas in order to allow red squirrel populations to recover and grow.

Although complex and controversial, the main factor in the eastern gray squirrel&#x27;s displacement of the red squirrel is thought to be its greater fitness, hence a competitive advantage over the red squirrel on all measures. Within 15 years of the grey squirrel&#x27;s introduction to a red squirrel habitat, red squirrel populations are extinct. The eastern gray squirrel tends to be larger and stronger than the red squirrel and has been shown to have a greater ability to store fat for winter. Due to the dearth of trees in their native Ireland for them to reside in, red squirrels are the only species being harmed by the invasion of grey squirrels. The squirrel can, therefore, compete more effectively for a larger share of the available food, resulting in relatively lower survival and breeding rates among the red squirrel. Parapoxvirus may also be a strongly contributing factor; red squirrels have long been fatally affected by the disease, while the eastern gray squirrels are unaffected, but thought to be carriers – although how the virus is transmitted has yet to be determined. Red squirrel extinction rates can be 20–25 times greater in areas with confirmed cases of squirrel pox than they are in areas without the disease. This competitive action done between these two squirrels is reasoned to qualify the eastern gray squirrel as a keystone species because since the eastern gray squirrel is coming and wiping out the red squirrels, there would be a reduced chance of competition hence more eastern gray squirrels will come in to Ireland. However, several cases of red squirrels surviving have been reported, as they have developed an immunity – although their population is still being massively affected. The red squirrel is also less tolerant of habitat destruction and fragmentation, which has led to its population decline, while the more adaptable eastern gray squirrel has taken advantage and expanded. Methods done to control this competition between these squirrels are that red squirrels should remain in their original habitats, such as Ireland, while the grey squirrels should be kept out of these places entirely as a means of controlling this squirrel competition.

Similar factors appear to have been at play in the Pacific region of North America, where the native American red squirrel has been largely displaced by the eastern gray squirrel in parks and forests throughout much of the region.

Ironically, &quot;fears&quot; for the future of the eastern gray squirrel arose in 2008, as the melanistic form (black) began to spread through the southern British population. In the UK, if a &quot;grey squirrel&quot; (eastern gray squirrel) is trapped, under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, it is illegal to release it or to allow it to escape into the wild; instead, it is legally required be &quot;humanely dispatched.&quot;

In the late 1990s, Italy&#x27;s National Wildlife Institute and University of Turin launched an eradication attempt to halt the spread of gray squirrels in northwest Italy, but court action by animal rights groups blocked this. Hence gray squirrels are expected to cross the Alps into France and Switzerland in the next few decades.

<text>The western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus) is a tree squirrel found along the western coast of the United States and Mexico. In some places, this species has also been known as the silver-gray squirrel, the California gray squirrel, the Oregon gray squirrel, the Columbian gray squirrel and the banner-tail. There are three geographical subspecies: &quot;Sciurus griseus griseus&quot; (central Washington to the western Sierra Nevada in central California); &quot;S. g. nigripes&quot; (from south of San Francisco Bay to San Luis Obispo County, California); and &quot;S. g. anthonyi&quot; (which ranges from San Luis Obispo to northern Baja California).

In some landscapes, the western gray squirrel has lost habitat or experienced local extinction due to competition with other squirrel species and other pressures on their population.

==Description==
The western gray squirrel was first described by George Ord in 1818 based on notes taken by Lewis and Clark at The Dalles in Wasco County, Oregon.

&quot;Sciurus griseus&quot; is the largest tree squirrel in the Sierra Nevada and Central California range. It has plantigrade, pentadactyl feet with two phalanges. Compared with the eastern gray squirrel &quot;S. carolinensis&quot; or the fox squirrel &quot;S. niger&quot; (which have been introduced into its native range), these squirrels are shy, and will generally run up a tree and give a hoarse chirping call when disturbed. Weights vary from about , and length (including tail) from . It is the largest native tree squirrel in the western coastal United States. Western gray squirrels exhibit a form of coloration known as counter shading. The dorsal fur is a silver gunmetal gray, with pure white on the underside; there may be black flecks in the tail. Ears are large but without tufts. The ears turn reddish-brown at the back in the winter. The tail is long and typically very bushy. It usually stays curved upwards in an &quot;S&quot; shape.

Tree squirrels undergo a complete head-to-tail molt in the spring and a rump-to-head molt in the fall. Tail hair is replaced only in the spring. Nesting mothers will use their tail hair to line birthing nests. Western gray squirrels eat berries, nuts, a variety of seeds, and the eggs of small birds. The dental formula for &quot;Sciurus griseus&quot; is .

==Reproduction==
Western gray squirrels reach sexual maturity at 10 to 11 months, and at approximately one year of age, will begin breeding. They mate over an extended period ranging from December through June. Young are born after approximate 44-day gestation period. Juveniles emerge from nests between March and mid-August. Litter sizes range from one to five kits which remain in the nest for a longer period than other squirrels. The kits are relatively slow in development, and will not leave the nest for six months or more, another species disadvantage when in competition with other, more-rapidly fledging squirrels. Young gray squirrels have furled tails which will not reach fullness until adulthood. This is a good indicator of age and maturity. Mother squirrels often seem to be overworked with a stressed appearance, complete with bruised and battered nipples. Mating squirrels can be very physical and will bite and injure each other. Females can be quite territorial, and will chase others away and have fairly violent altercations between themselves.

==Behavior and diet==
Western gray squirrels are forest dwellers. Time on the ground is spent foraging, but they prefer to travel distances from tree to tree. They are strictly diurnal, and feed mainly on seeds and nuts, particularly pine seeds and acorns, though they will also take berries, fungus and insects. Pine nuts and acorns are considered critical foods because they are very high in oil and moderately high in carbohydrates, which help increase the development of body fat. They feed mostly in trees and on the ground. They generally forage in the morning and late afternoon for acorns, pine nuts, new tree buds, and fruits. They feed on pinecones and many other nuts in preparation for the winter.

When on alert, they will spread their tails lavishly, creating an umbrella effect that shields them and possibly provides cover from overhead predators. They are scatter-hoarders making numerous caches of food when it is abundant, and thus contribute to the seed dispersion of their food trees. Although squirrels show relatively good scent relocation abilities, some food caches are never reclaimed, becoming seedlings in the spring. Though they do not hibernate, they do become less active during the winter. Like many prey animals, they depend on auditory alerts from other squirrels or birds to determine safety. Once an alarm call is transmitted, those present will join in, and the trees become a cacophony of chirping squirrels. Western gray squirrels are prey for hawks, eagles, bobcats, cougars, coyotes, raccoons, cats, dogs and humans.

==Habitat and shelter==

Squirrel nests are called dreys and can be seen in trees, built from sticks and leaves wrapped with long strands of grass. There are two stick nest types made by the western gray squirrel: the first is a large, round, covered shelter nest for winter use, birthing, and rearing young. The second is more properly termed a &quot;sleeping platform,&quot; a base for seasonal or temporary use. Both types are built with sticks and twigs and are lined with leaves, moss, lichens and shredded bark. The birthing nest may be lined with tail hair. The nest may measure by up to and is usually found in the top third of the tree. Young or traveling squirrels will also &quot;sleep rough&quot; when weather permits, balanced spread-eagled on a tree limb high above the forest floor. This attitude is also adopted for cooling in hot weather, a behavior also observed in raccoons.

The western gray squirrel is an arboreal species, requiring enough tree cover for arboreal travel. It resides in woody areas to build their complex nests. It lives in high and low elevations in California. It can be found at elevations up to 2,000 m. It find habitats in both walnut trees and black oak trees.

The western gray squirrel has many predators, including red-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), eagles (Accipitridae), bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), cougars (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) and domestic dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;). However, the predation does not control the squirrel&#x27;s population density.

In Washington State, the western gray squirrel was listed as a threatened species in 1993, and was reclassified as endangered in November 2023. Populations of the western gray squirrel have not recovered from past reductions. They are threatened with habitat loss, road-kill mortality and disease. Habitat has been lost due to urbanization, catastrophic wild fires, and areas of forest degraded by fire suppression and overgrazing, allowing the invasion of scotch broom. Notoedric mange, a disease caused by mites, becomes epidemic in western gray squirrel populations and is a major source of mortality. Other species, such as eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels, California ground squirrels and wild turkeys are expanding and competing with the western gray squirrel.

Listed as extirpated in some California areas, the western gray squirrel in southern California is generally found only in the mountains and surrounding foothill communities. Local rehabilitation experts recount that fox squirrels were released in urban regions of Los Angeles throughout the 20th century. Fox squirrels (&quot;Sciurus niger&quot;) were introduced to the Los Angeles area in about 1904. Civil War and Spanish–American War veterans residing at the Sawtelle Veterans Home on Sepulveda and Wilshire Boulevards brought fox squirrels as pets to this site from their homes in the areas surrounding the Mississippi Valley (possibly Tennessee). Other introductions of fox squirrels to the Los Angeles area may have taken place during more recent times, but detailed records are not available. These aggressive cousins drove the more reclusive western gray squirrels back into the mountains, where competition was not so strong. This non-native species introduction appears to be the largest threat in the southern California area.

<text>Burford () is a town on the River Windrush, in the Cotswold hills, in the West Oxfordshire district of Oxfordshire, England. It is often referred to as the &#x27;gateway&#x27; to the Cotswolds. Burford is located west of Oxford and southeast of Cheltenham, about from the Gloucestershire boundary. The toponym derives from the Old English words &quot;burh&quot; meaning fortified town or hilltown and &quot;ford&quot;, the crossing of a river. The 2011 Census recorded the population of Burford parish as 1,422.

==Economic and social history==
The town began in the middle Saxon period with the founding of a village near the site of the modern priory building. This settlement continued in use until just after the Norman Conquest of England when the new town of Burford was built. On the site of the old village a hospital was founded which remained open until the Dissolution of the Monasteries by King Henry VIII. The modern priory building was constructed some 40 years later, in around 1580.

The town centre&#x27;s most notable building is the Church of St John the Baptist, a Church of England parish church, which is a Grade I listed building. Described by David Verey as &quot;a complicated building which has developed in a curious way from the Norman&quot;, it is known for its merchants&#x27; guild chapel, memorial to Henry VIII&#x27;s barber-surgeon, Edmund Harman, featuring South American Indians and Kempe stained glass. In 1649 the church was used as a prison during the Civil War, when the New Model Army Banbury mutineers were held there. Some of the 340 prisoners left carvings and graffiti, which still survive in the church.
The town centre also has some 15th-century houses and the baroque-style townhouse that is now Burford Methodist Church. Between the 14th and 17th centuries Burford was important for its wool trade. The Tolsey, midway along Burford&#x27;s High Street, which was once the focal point for trade, is now a museum. The authors of &quot;Burford: Buildings and People in a Cotswold Town&quot; (2008) argue that Burford should be seen as less a medieval town than an Arts and Crafts town. A 2020 article in &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine summarized the community&#x27;s recent history:&quot;Burford, similarly, had bustled during the coaching era, but coaching inns such as Ramping Cat and the Bull were diminished or closed when the railways came. Agriculture remained old-fashioned, if not Biblical, and was badly affected by the long agricultural depression that started in the 1870s. The local dialect was so thick that, in the 1890s, Gibbs had to publish a glossary to explain George Ridler’s Oven, one of the folk songs he collected. In the late 19th century, the Cotswolds assumed a Sleeping Beauty charm, akin to that of Burne-Jones’s Legend of the Briar Rose at Buscot Park in the Thames Valley.&quot;

===Priory===

Burford Priory is a country house that stands on the site of a 13th-century Augustinian priory hospital. In the 1580s an Elizabethan house was built incorporating remnants of the building. It was remodelled in Jacobean style, probably after 1637, by which time the estate had been bought by William Lenthall, Speaker of the House of Commons in the Long Parliament. After 1912 the house and later the chapel were restored for the philanthropist Emslie John Horniman, MP, by the architect Walter Godfrey. From 1949 Burford Priory housed the Society of the Salutation of Mary the Virgin, a community of Church of England nuns. In 1987, in declining numbers, it became a mixed community including Church of England Benedictine monks. In 2008 the community relocated and sold the property which is now a private dwelling. A &quot;Time Team&quot; excavation of the Priory in 2010 found pottery sherds from the 12th or 13th century.

=== English Civil Wars – the Banbury mutiny ===
On 17 May 1649, three soldiers who were Levellers were executed on the orders of Oliver Cromwell in the churchyard at Burford following a mutiny started over pay and the prospect of being sent to fight in Ireland. Corporal Church, Private Perkins, and Cornet Thompson were the key leaders of the mutiny and, after a brief court-martial, were put up against the wall in the churchyard at Burford and shot.  The remaining soldiers were pardoned. Each year on the nearest weekend to the Banbury mutiny is commemorated as &#x27;Levellers Day&#x27;.

===Bell foundry===
Burford has twice had a bell foundry: one run by the Neale family in the 17th century and another run by the Bond family in the 19th and 20th centuries. Henry Neale was a bell founder between 1627 and 1641 and also had a foundry at Somerford Keynes in Gloucestershire. Edward Neale had joined him as a bell-founder at Burford by 1635 and continued the business until 1685. Numerous Neale bells remain in use, including at St Britius, Brize Norton, St Mary&#x27;s, Buscot, and St James the Great, Fulbrook. A few Neale bells that are no longer rung are displayed in Burford parish church. Henry Bond had a bell foundry at Westcot from 1851 to 1861. He then moved it to Burford where he continued until 1905. He was then succeeded by Thomas Bond, who continued bell-founding at Burford until 1947. Bond bells still in use include four of the ring of six at St John the Evangelist, Taynton, one and a Sanctus bell at St Nicholas, Chadlington and one each at St Mary the Virgin, Chalgrove and St Peter&#x27;s, Whatcote in Warwickshire.

===Easter Synod===
For many years before the 7th century there had been strife between the Celtic Church and the Early Church over the question of when Easter Day should be celebrated. The Britons adhered to the rule laid at the Council of Arles in 314, that Easter Day should be the 14th day of the Paschal moon, even if the moon were on a Sunday. The Roman Church had decided that when the 14th day of the Paschal moon was a Sunday, Easter Day should be the Sunday after. Various Synods were held in different parts of the kingdom with the object of settling this controversy, and one was held for this object at Burford in 685. Monk deduces from the fact of the Synod being held at Burford, that the Britons in some numbers had settled in the town and neighbourhood. This Synod was attended by Æthelred, King of Mercia, and his nephew Berthwald (who had been granted the southern part of his uncle&#x27;s kingdom); Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury; Bosel, Bishop of Worcester; Seaxwulf, Bishop of Lichfield; Aldhelm, Abbot of Malmesbury; and many others. Aldhelm was ordered at this conference to write a book against the error of the Britons in the observance of Easter. At this Synod Berthwald gave 40 cassates of land (a cassate is enough land to support a family) to Aldhelm who afterwards became Bishop of Shereborne. According to Spelman, the notes of the Synod were published in 705.
===Battle of Burford and the Golden Dragon===
Malmesbury and other chroniclers record a battle between the West Saxons and Mercians at Burford in 752. In the end Æthelhum, the Mercian standard-bearer who carried the flag with a golden dragon on it, was killed by the lance of his Saxon rival. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records &quot;A.D 752. This year Cuthred, king of the West Saxons, in the 12th year of his reign, fought at Burford, against Æthelbald king of the Mercians, and put him to flight.&quot; The historian William Camden (1551–1623) wrote
&quot;... in Saxon Beorgford [i.e. Burford], where Cuthred, king of the West Saxons, then tributary to the Mercians, not being able to endure any longer the cruelty and base exactions of King Æthelbald, met him in the open field with an army and beat him, taking his standard, which was a portraiture of a golden dragon.&quot;

The origin of the golden dragon standard is attributed to that of Uther Pendragon, the father of King Arthur of whom Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote:
[Uther Pendragon] &quot;... ordered two dragons to be fashioned in gold, in the likeness of the one which he had seen in the ray which shone from that star. As soon as the Dragons had been completed this with the most marvellous craftsmanship – he made a present of one of them to the congregation of the cathedral church of the see of Winchester. The second one he kept for himself, so that he could carry it around to his wars.&quot;

In the late 16th or early 17th century the people of Burford still celebrated the anniversary of the battle. Camden wrote: &quot;There has been a custom in the town of making a great dragon yearly, and carrying it up and down the streets in great jollity on St John&#x27;s Eve&quot;. The field traditionally claimed to be that of the battle is still called Battle Edge. According to Reverend Francis Knollis&#x27; description of the discovery, &quot;On 21 November 1814 a large freestone sarcophagus was discovered near Battle Edge below ground, weighing with the feet pointing almost due south. The interior is long and wide. It was found to contain the remains of a human body, with portions of a leather cuirass studded with metal nails. The skeleton was found in near perfect state due to the exclusion of air from the sarcophagus.&quot; The coffin is now preserved in Burford churchyard, near the west gate.

&quot;Whose fame is in that dark green tomb? Four stones with their heads of moss stand there. They mark the narrow house of death. Some chief of fame is here! Raise the songs of old! Awake their memory in the tomb.&quot; – Ossian

==Amenities==
Burford County Primary School is the town&#x27;s primary school. Burford School, a mixed comprehensive school, is the town&#x27;s secondary school. The primary school fête, held every summer, includes a procession (including a dragon) down High Street to the school, where there are stalls and games. The Blue Cross National Animal Welfare Charity is based at Burford. In September 2001 Burford was twinned with Potenza Picena, a small town in the Marche, on the Adriatic coast of Italy. In April 2009 Burford was ranked sixth in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;Europe&#x27;s Most Idyllic Places To Live&quot;.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Oxford, Heart South, Greatest Hits Radio South (formerly Jack FM) and Witney Radio, a community-based station which broadcast from Witney. The town&#x27;s local newspapers are the &quot;Oxfordshire Guardian&quot; and &quot;Witney Gazette&quot;. &quot;The Bridge Magazine&quot; is a local community magazine produced by and for the people of Burford and surrounding villages in West Oxfordshire.

==Local legend and literature==
Local legend tells of a fiery coach containing the judge and local landowner Sir Lawrence Tanfield of Burford Priory and his wife flying around the town that brings a curse upon all who see it. Ross Andrews speculates that the apparition may have been caused by a local tradition of burning effigies of the unpopular couple that began after their deaths. In real life Tanfield and his second wife Elizabeth Evans are known to have been notoriously harsh to their tenants. The visitations were reportedly ended when local clergymen trapped Lady Tanfield&#x27;s ghost in a corked glass bottle during an exorcism and cast it into the River Windrush. During droughts locals would fill the river from buckets to ensure that the bottle did not rise above the surface and free the spirit. Burford is the main setting for &quot;The Wool-Pack&quot;, a historical novel for children by Cynthia Harnett. The author J. Meade Falkner, best known for the novel &quot;Moonfleet&quot;, is buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist.

<text>Aberbeeg () is a village which lies in both Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly County Borough, in Wales, within the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire. It is part of the community of Llanhilleth. The two main tributaries of the Ebbw River, the Ebbw Fawr and Ebbw Fach converge at Aberbeeg.

Nearby are the villages of Llanhilleth and Six Bells, where the former colliery allowed the whole community to thrive as part of the South Wales coalfield community.
Today, one of the most prominent sights in Aberbeeg area is the grade II* listed St. Illtyd&#x27;s parish church, which is thought to have been built in the late 5th century, and underwent extensive renovation over the last 200 years. After closing in 1962, the church was privately acquired in 1984. It has now returned to public ownership and is now open to visitors. The friends of St. Illtyd help Blaenau Gwent look after the building.

Aberbeeg railway station closed on 30 April 1962. The Ebbw Valley Railway re-opened in February 2008. A bus service between Aberbeeg and Llanhilleth, the nearest railway station on the line, runs every hour.

It is named after the Nant Big (also spelled ), a small stream that flows into the Ebbw Fawr river approximately half-a-mile upstream from the confluence of the Ebbw Fawr and Ebbw Fach. The term &quot;bîg&quot; (later &quot;beeg&quot;) in the Welsh name, is derived from the Welsh term &quot;pig&quot;, meaning a beak or spout, which may refer to a spot where the small stream emerges.
==In popular culture==
In the TV series Fresh Meat one of the lead characters, Josie (Kimberley Nixon), states she is from Aberbeeg.

<doc id="408184" wikidata="Q1234827" url="?curid=408184" title="Lynton">
<text>Lynton is a town on the Exmoor coast in the North Devon district in the county of Devon, England, approximately north-east of Barnstaple and west of Minehead, and close to the confluence of the West Lyn and East Lyn rivers. Lynton sits directly above the neighbouring village of Lynmouth; the two settlements are separated by a steep gorge.

==Governance==
Lynton is part of the Lynton and Lynmouth electoral ward whose total ward population at the 2011 census was 1,647. The two communities are governed at local level by Lynton and Lynmouth Town Council.

==Location and geography==
The two settlements are connected by the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway.

The South West Coast Path and Tarka Trail pass through, and the Two Moors Way runs from Ivybridge in South Devon to Lynmouth. The Samaritans Way South West runs from Bristol to Lynton and the Coleridge Way from Nether Stowey to Lynmouth.

The Valley of Rocks and Wringcliff Bay are to the west.

==History and buildings==

Evidence of Iron Age activity can be found at the nearby Roborough Castle.

Lynton&#x27;s Parish Church of St Mary, stands overlooking the sea, surrounded by shops and hotels. The tower is mainly 13th century but the church itself has been enlarged and altered — most notably in 1741 and in late Victorian/early Edwardian times.

Many of the town&#x27;s buildings were constructed in the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century. Lynton Town Hall was given to the town by Sir George Newnes, Bart., a major benefactor of the town; it was opened on 15 August 1900. He also gave the town the United Reformed Church building (originally a Congregational church) on Lee Road.

==Twinning==
Lynton and Lynmouth are jointly twinned with Bénouville in France.

==Transport==
Lynton was once the terminus for the narrow-gauge Lynton &amp; Barnstaple Railway, which served both towns.

, Lynton is served by the following bus services:
*309/310 Lynton &amp; Lynmouth - Barnstaple (Filers Travel)

==Sport==

The Lynton &amp; Lynmouth Cricket Club, founded in August 1876, meet at the Valley of Rocks.

==Notable people==

<doc id="408186" wikidata="Q627125" url="?curid=408186" title="Labor history of the United States">
<text>The nature and power of organized labor in the United States is the outcome of historical tensions among counter-acting forces involving workplace rights, wages, working hours, political expression, labor laws, and other working conditions. Organized unions and their umbrella labor federations such as the AFL–CIO and citywide federations have competed, evolved, merged, and split against a backdrop of changing values and priorities, and periodic federal government intervention.

In most industrial nations, the labor movement sponsored its own political parties, with the US as a conspicuous exception. Both major American parties vied for union votes, with the Democratic Party usually much more successful. Labor unions became a central element of the New Deal coalition that dominated national politics from the 1930s into the mid-1960s during the Fifth Party System. Liberal Republicans who supported unions in the Northeast lost power after 1964. In recent decades, an enduring alliance was formed between labor unions and the Democrats, whereas the Republican Party has become hostile to unions and collective bargaining rights.

The history of organized labor has been a specialty of scholars since the 1890s, and has produced a large amount of scholarly literature focused on the structure of organized unions. In the 1960s, the sub-field of new labor history emerged as social history was gaining popularity broadly, with a new emphasis on the history of workers, including unorganized workers, and their gender and race. Much scholarship has attempted to bring the social history perspectives into the study of organized labor.

By most measures, the strength of organized labor has declined in the United States over recent decades.

==Organized labor prior to 1900==
The history of labor disputes in America substantially precedes the Revolutionary period. In 1636, for instance, there was a fishermen&#x27;s strike on an island off the coast of Maine and in 1677 twelve carmen were fined for going on strike in New York City. However, most instances of labor unrest during the colonial period were temporary and isolated, and rarely resulted in the formation of permanent groups of laborers for negotiation purposes. Little legal recourse was available to those injured by the unrest, because strikes were not typically considered illegal. The only known case of criminal prosecution of workers in the colonial era occurred as a result of a carpenters&#x27; strike in Savannah in 1746.

===Legality and &quot;Hunt&quot; (1842)===

By the early 19th century, the career path for most artisans still involved apprenticeship under a master, followed by moving into independent production. However, over the course of the Industrial Revolution, this model rapidly changed, particularly in the major metropolitan areas. For instance, in Boston in 1790, the vast majority of the 1,300 artisans in the city described themselves as &quot;master workman&quot;. By 1815, journeymen workers without independent means of production had displaced these &quot;masters&quot; as the majority. By that time journeymen also outnumbered masters in New York City and Philadelphia. This shift occurred as a result of large-scale transatlantic and rural-urban migration. Migration into the coastal cities created a larger population of potential laborers, which in turn allowed controllers of capital to invest in labor-intensive enterprises on a larger scale. Craft workers found that these changes launched them into competition with each other to a degree that they had not experienced previously, which limited their opportunities and created substantial risks of downward mobility that had not existed prior to that time.

These conditions led to the first labor combination cases in America. Over the first half of the 19th century, there are twenty-three known cases of indictment and prosecution for criminal conspiracy, taking place in six states: Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Virginia. The central question in these cases was invariably whether workmen in combination would be permitted to use their collective bargaining power to obtain benefits—increased wages, decreased hours, or improved conditions—which were beyond their ability to obtain as individuals. The cases overwhelmingly resulted in convictions. However, in most instances the plaintiffs&#x27; desire was to establish favorable precedent, not to impose harsh penalties, and the fines were typically modest.

One of the central themes of the cases prior to the landmark decision in &quot;Commonwealth v. Hunt&quot;, 45 Mass.111 (1842), which settled the legality of unions, was the applicability of the English common law in post-revolutionary America. Whether the English common law applied—and in particular whether the common law notion that a conspiracy to raise wages was illegal applied—was frequently the subject of debate between the defense and the prosecution. For instance, in &quot;Commonwealth v. Pullis&quot;, 3 Doc.Hist.59 (1806), a case against a combination of journeymen cordwainers in Philadelphia for conspiracy to raise their wages, the defense attorneys referred to the common law as arbitrary and unknowable and instead praised the legislature as the embodiment of the democratic promise of the revolution. In ruling that a combination to raise wages was &quot;per se&quot; illegal, recorder Moses Levy strongly disagreed, writing that &quot;[t]he acts of the legislature form but a small part of that code from which the citizen is to learn his duties... [i]t is in the volumes of the common law we are to seek for information in the far greater number, as well as the most important causes that come before our tribunals.&quot;

As a result of the spate of convictions against combinations of laborers, the typical narrative of early American labor law states that, prior to &quot;Hunt&quot; in Massachusetts in 1842, peaceable combinations of workingmen to raise wages, shorten hours or ensure employment, were illegal in the United States, as they had been under English common law. In England, criminal conspiracy laws were first held to include combinations in restraint of trade in the Court of Star Chamber early in the 17th century. The precedent was solidified in 1721 by &quot;R v Journeymen Tailors of Cambridge&quot;, which found tailors guilty of a conspiracy to raise wages. Leonard Levy went so far as to refer to &quot;Hunt&quot; as the &quot;Magna Carta of American trade-unionism&quot;, illustrating its perceived standing as the major point of divergence in the American and English legal treatment of unions which, &quot;removed the stigma of criminality from labor organizations&quot;.

However, case law in America prior to &quot;Hunt&quot; was mixed. &quot;Pullis&quot; was actually unusual in strictly following the English common law and holding that a combination to raise wages was by itself illegal. More often combination cases prior to &quot;Hunt&quot; did not hold that unions were illegal &quot;per se&quot;, but rather found some other justification for a conviction. After &quot;Pullis&quot; in 1806, eighteen other prosecutions of laborers for conspiracies followed within the next three decades. However, only one such case, &quot;People v. Fisher&quot;, also held that a combination for the purpose of raising wages was illegal. Several other cases held that the methods used by the unions, rather than the unions themselves, were illegal. For instance, in &quot;People v. Melvin&quot;, cordwainers were again convicted of a conspiracy to raise wages. Unlike in &quot;Pullis&quot;, however, the court held that the combination&#x27;s existence itself was not unlawful, but nevertheless reached a conviction because the cordwainers had refused to work for any master who paid lower wages, or with any laborer who accepted lower wages than what the combination had stipulated. The court held that methods used to obtain higher wages would be unlawful if they were judged to be deleterious to the general welfare of the community. &quot;Commonwealth v. Morrow&quot; continued to refine this standard, stating that, &quot;an agreement of two or more to the prejudice of the rights of others or of society&quot; would be illegal.

Another line of cases, led by Justice John Gibson of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania&#x27;s decision in &quot;Commonwealth v. Carlisle&quot;, held that motive of the combination, rather than simply its existence, was the key to illegality. Gibson wrote, &quot;Where the act is lawful for an individual, it can be the subject of a conspiracy, when done in concert, only where there is a direct intention that injury shall result from it&quot;. Still other courts rejected &quot;Pullis&quot;″ rule of &quot;per se&quot; illegality in favor of a rule that asked whether the combination was a but-for cause of injury. Thus, as economist Edwin Witte stated, &quot;The doctrine that a combination to raise wages is illegal was allowed to die by common consent. No leading case was required for its overthrow&quot;. Nevertheless, while &quot;Hunt&quot; was not the first case to hold that labor combinations were legal, it was the first to do so explicitly and in clear terms.

===Early federations===
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen — now part of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters — was founded in May 1863.

The National Labor Union (NLU), founded in 1866, was the first national labor federation in the United States. It was dissolved in 1872.

The regional Order of the Knights of St. Crispin was founded in the northeast in 1867 and claimed 50,000 members by 1870, by far the largest union in the country. A closely associated union of women, the Daughters of St. Crispin, formed in 1870. In 1879 the Knights formally admitted women, who by 1886 constituted 10 percent of the union&#x27;s membership, but it was poorly organized and soon declined. They fought encroachments of machinery and unskilled labor on autonomy of skilled shoe workers. One provision in the Crispin constitution explicitly sought to limit the entry of &quot;green hands&quot; into the trade, but this failed because the new machines could be operated by semi-skilled workers and produce more shoes than hand sewing.

===Railroad brotherhoods===

With the rapid growth and consolidation of large railroad systems after 1870, union organizations sprang up, covering the entire nation. By 1901, 17 major railway brotherhoods were in operation; they generally worked amicably with management, which recognized their usefulness. Key unions included the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Division (BMWED), the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. Their main goal was building insurance and medical packages for their members, as well as negotiating work rules, such as those involving seniority and grievance procedures.

They were not members of the AFL, and fought off more radical rivals such as the Knights of Labor in the 1880s and the American Railroad Union in the 1890s. They consolidated their power in 1916, after threatening a national strike, by securing the Adamson Act, a federal law that provided 10 hours pay for an eight-hour day. At the end of World WarI they promoted nationalization of the railroads, and conducted a national strike in 1919. Both programs failed, and the brotherhoods were largely stagnant in the 1920s. They generally were independent politically, but supported the third party campaign of Robert M. La Follette in 1924.

===Knights of Labor===

The first effective labor organization that was more than regional in membership and influence was the Knights of Labor, organized in 1869. The Knights believed in the unity of the interests of all producing groups and sought to enlist in their ranks not only all laborers but everyone who could be truly classified as a producer. The acceptance of all producers led to explosive growth after 1880. Under the leadership of Terence V. Powderly they championed a variety of causes, sometimes through political or cooperative ventures.

Powderly hoped to gain their ends through politics and education rather than through economic coercion. The Knights were especially successful in developing a working class culture, involving women, families, sports, and leisure activities and educational projects for the membership. The Knights strongly promoted their version of republicanism that stressed the centrality of free labor, preaching harmony and cooperation among producers, as opposed to parasites and speculators.

One of the earliest railroad strikes was also one of the most successful. In 1885, the Knights of Labor led railroad workers to victory against Jay Gould and his entire southwestern railway system, consisting of the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Denver and Rio Grande Railway. In early 1886, the Knights were trying to coordinate 1,400 strikes involving over 600,000 workers spread over much of the country. The tempo had doubled over 1885, and involved peaceful as well as violent confrontations in many sectors, such as railroads, street railroads, and coal mining, with demands usually focused on the eight hour day. Suddenly, it all collapsed, largely because the Knights were unable to handle so much on their plate at once, and because they took a smashing blow in the aftermath of the Haymarket affair in May 1886 in Chicago.

The Haymarket affair started as a strike organized by the Knights at the McCormick Reaper Factory in Chicago. Along with the McCormick strike, on May 1, 80,000 mostly immigrant workers led a general strike in Chicago, along with 340,000 workers in the rest of the United States. Attending the strike were a rising movement of armed anarchists formed as a result of the police violence of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. While beginning relatively peacefully, police and strikers began to clash. As strikers rallied against the McCormick plant, a team of political anarchists, who were not Knights, tried to piggyback support among striking Knights workers. A bomb exploded as police were dispersing a peaceful rally, killing seven policemen and wounding many others. The anarchists—who had built the bomb—were blamed. Their spectacular trial gained national attention. The Knights of Labor were seriously injured by the false accusation that the Knights promoted anarchistic violence. Some Knights locals transferred to the less radical and more respectable AFL unions or railroad brotherhoods.

===American Federation of Labor===

The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions began in 1881 under the leadership of Samuel Gompers. Like the National Labor Union, it was a federation of different unions and did not directly enroll workers. Its original goals were to encourage the formation of trade unions and to obtain legislation, such as prohibition of child labor, a national eight-hour workday, and exclusion of Chinese and other foreign contract workers.

Strikes organized by labor unions became routine events by the 1880s. There were 37,000 strikes between 1881 and 1905. By far the largest number were in the building trades, followed far behind by coal miners. The main goal was control of working conditions, setting uniform wage scales, protesting the firing of a member, and settling which rival union was in control. Most strikes were of very short duration. In times of depression strikes were more violent but less successful, because the company was losing money anyway. They were successful in times of prosperity when the company was losing profits and wanted to settle quickly.

The Federation made some efforts to obtain favorable legislation, but had little success in organizing or chartering new unions. It came out in support of the proposal, traditionally attributed to Peter J. McGuire of the Carpenters Union, for a national Labor Day holiday on the first Monday in September. It also threw itself behind the eight hour movement, which sought to limit the workday by either legislation or union negotiation.

In 1886, as the relations between the trade union movement and the Knights of Labor worsened, McGuire and other union leaders called for a convention to be held at Columbus, Ohio, on December 8. The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions merged with the new organization, known as the American Federation of Labor or AFL, formed at that convention.

The AFL was formed in large part because of the dissatisfaction of many trade union leaders with the Knights of Labor, an organization that contained many trade unions and that had played a leading role in some of the largest strikes of the era. The new AFL distinguished itself from the Knights by emphasizing the autonomy of each trade union affiliated with it and limiting membership to workers and organizations made up of workers, unlike the Knights which, because of its producerist focus, welcomed some who were not wage workers.

The AFL grew steadily in the late 19th century while the Knights all but disappeared. Although Gompers at first advocated something like industrial unionism, he retreated from that in the face of opposition from the craft unions that made up most of the AFL.

The unions of the AFL were composed primarily of skilled men; unskilled workers, African-Americans, and women were generally excluded. The AFL saw women as threatening the jobs of men, since they often worked for lower wages.

===Western Federation of Miners===
The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was created in 1893. Frequently in competition with the American Federation of Labor, the WFM spawned new federations, including the Western Labor Union (later renamed to the American Labor Union). The WFM took a conservative turn in the aftermath of the Colorado Labor Wars and the trials of its president, Charles Moyer, and its secretary treasurer, Big Bill Haywood, for the conspiratorial assassination of Idaho&#x27;s former governor. Although both were found innocent, the WFM, headed by Moyer, separated itself from the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) (launched by Haywood and other labor radicals, socialists, and anarchists in 1905) just a few years after that organization&#x27;s founding convention. In 1916 the WFM became the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers, which was eventually absorbed by the United Steelworkers of America.

===Pullman Strike===
During the major economic depression of the early 1890s, the Pullman Palace Car Company cut wages in its factories. Discontented workers joined the American Railway Union (ARU), led by Eugene V. Debs, which supported their strike by launching a boycott of all Pullman cars on all railroads. ARU members across the nation refused to switch Pullman cars onto trains. When these switchmen were disciplined, the entire ARU struck the railroads on June 26, 1894. Within four days, 125,000 workers on twenty-nine railroads had people quit work rather than handle Pullman cars. Strikers and their supporters also engaged in riots and sabotage.

The railroads were able to get Edwin Walker, general counsel for the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway, appointed as a special federal attorney with responsibility for dealing with the strike. Walker went to federal court and obtained an injunction barring union leaders from supporting the boycott in any way. The court injunction was based on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act which prohibited &quot;Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States&quot;. Debs and other leaders of the ARU ignored the injunction, and federal troops were called into action.

The strike was broken up by United States Marshals and some 2,000 United States Army troops, commanded by Nelson Miles, sent in by President Grover Cleveland on the premise that the strike interfered with the delivery of US Mail. During the course of the strike, 13 strikers were killed and 57 were wounded. An estimated $340,000 worth of property damage occurred during the strike. Debs went to prison for six months for violating the federal court order, and the ARU disintegrated.

==Organized labor, 1900–1920==

Australian historian Peter Shergold confirms the findings of many scholars that the standard of living for US industrial workers was higher than in Europe. He compares wages and the standard of living in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, England. He finds that, after taking into account the cost of living (which was 65 percent higher in the US), the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the two cities, while skilled workers had about twice as high a standard of living. The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America. Shergold revealed that skilled Americans did earn higher wages than the British, yet unskilled workers did not, while Americans worked longer hours, with a greater chance of injury, and had fewer social services.

American industry had the highest rate of accidents in the world. The US was also the only industrial power to have no workman&#x27;s compensation program in place to support injured workers.

From 1860 to 1900, the wealthiest 2 percent of American households owned more than a third of the nation&#x27;s wealth, while the top 10 percent owned roughly three-quarters of it. The bottom 40 percent had no wealth at all. In terms of property, the wealthiest 1 percent owned 51 percent, while the bottom 44 percent claimed 1.1 percent. Historian Howard Zinn argues that this disparity along with precarious working and living conditions for the working classes prompted the rise of populist, anarchist, and socialist movements. French economist Thomas Piketty notes that economists during this time, such as Willford I. King, were concerned that the United States was becoming increasingly inegalitarian to the point of becoming like old Europe, and &quot;further and further away from its original pioneering ideal.&quot;

Nationwide from 1890 to 1914 the unionized wages in manufacturing rose from $17.63 a week to $21.37, and the average work week fell from 54.4 to 48.8 hours a week. The pay for all factory workers was $11.94 and $15.84 because unions reached only the more skilled factory workers.

===Coal strikes, 1900–1902===

The United Mine Workers was successful in its strike against soft coal mines in the Midwest in 1900, but its strike against the hard coal mines of Pennsylvania turned into a national political crisis in 1902. President Theodore Roosevelt brokered a compromise solution that kept the flow of coal going, and higher wages and shorter hours, but did not include recognition of the union as a bargaining agent.

===Women&#x27;s Trade Union League===
The Women&#x27;s Trade Union League, formed in 1903, was the first labor organization dedicated to helping working women. It did not organize them into locals; its goal was to support the AFL and encourage more women to join labor unions. It was composed of both working women and middle-class reformers, and provided financial assistance, moral support, and training in work skills and social refinement for blue-collar women. Most active in 1907–1922 under Margaret Dreier Robins, it publicized the cause and lobbied for minimum wages and restrictions on hours of work and child labor. Also under Dreier&#x27;s leadership, they were able to pass crucial legislation for wage workers, and establish new safety regulations.

In 1911, a fire broke out in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in Manhattan, New York City. Due to the lack of fire safety measures in the building, 146 primarily female workers were killed in the incident. This incident led to a movement to increase safety measures in factories. It also was an opportunity for the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League to open conversation for the conditions of women&#x27;s workplaces in the labor movement.

===Industrial Workers of the World===

The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), whose members became known as &quot;Wobblies&quot;, was founded in Chicago in 1905 by a group of about 30 labor radicals. Their most prominent leader was William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood. The IWW pioneered creative tactics, and organized along the lines of industrial unionism rather than craft unionism; in fact, they went even further, pursuing the goal of &quot;One Big Union&quot; and the abolition of the wage system. Many, though not all, Wobblies favored anarcho-syndicalism.

Much of the IWW&#x27;s organizing took place in the West, and most of its early members were miners, lumbermen, cannery, and dock workers. In 1912 the IWW organized a strike of more than twenty thousand textile workers, and by 1917 the Agricultural Workers Organization (AWO) of the IWW claimed a hundred thousand itinerant farm workers in the heartland of North America. Eventually the concept of One Big Union spread from dock workers to maritime workers, and thus was communicated to many different parts of the world. Dedicated to workplace and economic democracy, the IWW allowed men and women as members, and organized workers of all races and nationalities, without regard to current employment status. At its peak it had 150,000 members (with 200,000 membership cards issued between 1905 and 1916), but it was fiercely repressed during, and especially after, World War I with many of its members killed, about 10,000 organizers imprisoned, and thousands more deported as foreign agitators. In 1927 the IWW also led a successful Colorado general coal strike for better conditions.
The IWW proved that unskilled workers could be organized. The IWW exists today, but its most significant impact was during its first two decades of existence.

===Government and labor===
In 1908 the US Supreme Court decided &quot;Loewe v. Lawlor&quot; (the Danbury Hatters&#x27; Case). In 1902 the Hatters&#x27; Union instituted a nationwide boycott of the hats made by a nonunion company in Connecticut. Owner Dietrich Loewe brought suit against the union for unlawful combinations to restrain trade in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Court ruled that the union was subject to an injunction and liable for the payment of triple damages.

In 1915 Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, speaking for the Court, again decided in favor of Loewe, upholding a lower federal court ruling ordering the union to pay damages of $252,130. (The cost of lawyers had already exceeded $100,000, paid by the AFL). This was not a typical case in which a few union leaders were punished with short terms in jail; specifically, the life savings of several hundreds of the members were attached. The lower court ruling established a major precedent, and became a serious issue for the unions.

The Clayton Act of 1914 presumably exempted unions from the antitrust prohibition and established for the first time the Congressional principle that &quot;the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce&quot;. However, judicial interpretation so weakened it that prosecutions of labor under the antitrust acts continued until the enactment of the Norris-La Guardia Act in 1932.
* &quot;Loewe v. Lawlor&quot;, 208 U.S. 274 (1908), 235 U.S. 522 (1915)

State legislation 1912–1918: 36 states adopted the principle of workmen&#x27;s compensation for all industrial accidents. Also: prohibition of the use of an industrial poison, several states require one day&#x27;s rest in seven, the beginning of effective prohibition of night work, of maximum limits upon the length of the working day, and of minimum wage laws for women.

===Colorado Coalfield War===
On 23 September 1913, the United Mine Workers of America declared a strike against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron, in what is better known as the Colorado Coalfield War. The peak of the violence came after months of back-and-forth murders that culminated in the 20 April 1914 Ludlow Massacre that killed over a dozen women and children when Colorado National Guard opened fire on a striker encampment at Ludlow. The strike is considered the deadliest labor unrest in American history.

===World War I===

Samuel Gompers and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort. They used their leverage to gain recognition and higher wages. They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached. To keep factories running smoothly, Wilson established the National War Labor Board in 1918, which forced management to negotiate with existing unions. The AFL unions and the railway brotherhoods strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the United States Armed Forces. They fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti-war IWW and left-wing Socialists. President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful Council of National Defense, where he set up the War Committee on Labor. The AFL membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917. Anti-war socialists controlled the IWW, which fought against the war effort and was in turn shut down by legal action of the federal government.

==== Women in the labor force ====

During WWI, large numbers of women were recruited into jobs that had either been vacated by men who had gone to fight in the war, or had been created as part of the war effort. The high demand for weapons and the overall wartime situation resulted in munitions factories collectively becoming the largest employer of American women by 1918. While there was initial resistance to hiring women for jobs traditionally held by men, the war made the need for labor so urgent that women were hired in large numbers and the government even actively promoted the employment of women in war-related industries through recruitment drives. As a result, women not only began working in heavy industry, but also took other jobs traditionally reserved solely for men, such as railway guards, ticket collectors, bus and tram conductors, postal workers, police officers, firefighters, and clerks.

World War I saw women taking traditionally men&#x27;s jobs in large numbers for the first time in American history. Many women worked on the assembly lines of factories, producing trucks and munitions, while department stores employed African American women as elevator operators and cafeteria waitresses for the first time. The Food Administration helped housewives prepare more nutritious meals with less waste and with optimum use of the foods available. Morale of women remained high, as millions joined the Red Cross as volunteers to help soldiers and their families, and with rare exceptions, women did not protest the draft.

The United States Department of Labor created a Women in Industry group, headed by prominent labor researcher and social scientist Mary van Kleeck. This group helped develop standards for women who were working in industries connected to the war, alongside the War Labor Policies Board, of which van Kleeck was also a member. After the war, the Women in Industry Service group developed into the US Women&#x27;s Bureau, headed by Mary Anderson.

===== Women of color =====

Women of color played a significant role in the American labor movement of the 20th century, helping to advance workers&#x27; rights in a variety of workplace environments, including fields, factories, and homes. They used instruments including labor unions, strikes, and legislative campaigning to improve their working conditions, pay, and hours. These women took part in neighborhood projects addressing labor rights in addition to being involved in the women&#x27;s suffrage and civil rights movements. Their principal battle was for equal treatment in society. A particularly famous leader of the African-American community was Ella Baker who helped organize the Young Negroes Cooperative League in the early 1930s, a group that was help pool community resources and provide cheaper goods and services to members. She later cofounded In Friendship, an organization that raised money for the civil rights movement. She went on to help form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Two other important leaders, Dorothy Height—who worked to help improve opportunities for African-American women—and activist Dolores Huerta—who lobbied on behalf of migrant farmers and eventually founded the United Farm Workers of America—were also essential in promoting social justice and fair labor standards. Their combined efforts made a big difference in creating a more diverse and equal workplace.
===== Jewish women =====

Jewish women played a significant role in the American labor movement of the 20th century. Jewish mass immigration came to the United States in the early twentieth century, just as the ready-made clothing industry skyrocketed. In the Old Country, most Jewish women were married off as quickly as possible; in America, that was no longer an option. Families counted on women&#x27;s wages, sometimes sending that money back to their families in Europe or using it to pay the rent, buy food and clothing, bring relatives from Europe to America, or keep the men in their family in school. Most women learned to sew in the workshops of the Old Country and they utilized this skill to help them find jobs in the United States.

Unfortunately, women who worked in garment factories were often subject to sexual harassment, unsafe conditions, exploitation, and wage discrimination. And yet, as Jews who emerged from a left-wing progressive tradition, these female garment workers nurtured a commitment to social justice, one that served as the catalyst for the labor organizing that these women later led.

A number of unions were created in the Lower East Side during the beginning of the 20th century. Most were organized by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, an organization that was founded in 1900 and, while initially founded by and only accessible to men, went on to be run by many Jewish women who advocated for education as a means of shaping a society that could support the working class.

Strikes in the women&#x27;s garment industry occurred almost yearly in one city or another. A notable example took place in 1909 and was led by Rose Schneiderman. Schneiderman worked as a cap maker in New York City and, after encountering poor working conditions, decided to organize a local union of the United Cloth and Cap Makers in New York City. Soon after, Schneiderman began serving as vice president of the New York Women&#x27;s Trade Union League, where she organized the &quot;Uprising of the 20,000&quot; a landmark garment workers&#x27; strike that took place from 1909 to 1910 and eventually led to basic improvements for workers.

===Strikes of 1919===

In 1919, the AFL tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat, steel, and many other industries. Management counterattacked, claiming that key strikes were run by Communists intent on destroying capitalism. Nearly all the strikes ultimately failed, forcing unions back to positions similar to those around 1910.

====Coal strike of 1919====
The United Mine Workers under John L. Lewis called a strike for November 1, 1919, in all soft (bituminous) coal fields. They had agreed to a wage agreement to run until the end of World War I and now sought to make permanent their wartime gains. US Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer invoked the Lever Act, a wartime measure that made it a crime to interfere with the production or transportation of necessities. Ignoring the court order 400,000 coal workers walked out. The coal operators played the radical card, saying Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press echoed that language.

Lewis, facing criminal charges and sensitive to the propaganda campaign, withdrew his strike call. Lewis did not fully control the faction-ridden UAW and many locals ignored his call. As the strike dragged on into its third week, supplies of the nation&#x27;s main fuel were running low and the public called for ever stronger government action. Final agreement came after five weeks with the miners getting a 14 percent raise.

====Women telephone operators win strike in 1919====
One important strike was won by labor. Moved to action by the rising cost of living, the president of the Boston Telephone Operator&#x27;s Union, Julia O&#x27;Connor, asked for higher wages from the New England Telephone Company. Wages of operators averaged a third less than women in manufacturing. In April, 9,000 women operators in New England went on strike, shutting down most telephone service. The company hired college students as strikebreakers, but they came under violent attack by men supporting the strikers. In a few days a settlement was reached giving higher wages. After the success O&#x27;Connor began a national campaign to organize women operators.

==Weakness of organized labor, 1920–1929==

The 1920s marked a period of sharp decline for the labor movement. Union membership and activities fell sharply due to many factors including generalized economic prosperity, a lack of leadership within the movement, and anti-union sentiments from employers, governments and the general population. Labor unions were much less able to organize strikes. In 1919, more than 4 million workers (or 21 percent of the labor force) participated in about 3,600 strikes. In contrast, 1929 witnessed about 289,000 workers (or 1.2 percent of the labor force) stage only 900 strikes. The aftermath of the 1910 Los Angeles Times Bombing also contributed to a widespread decline in unionization. The bombing, one of dozens of terrorist sabotage events nationwide organized by members of the International Association of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers, killed 21 and injured over 100. The guilty verdicts &quot;devastated the American labor movement, virtually paralyzing it until the New Deal.&quot;

After a short recession in 1920, the 1920s was a generally prosperous decade outside of farming and coal mining. The GNP growth 1921-29 was a very strong 6.0 percent, double the long-term average of about 3 percent. Real annual earnings (in 1914 dollars) for all employees (deducting for unemployment) was $566 in 1921 and $793 in 1929, a real gain of 40 percent. The economic prosperity of the decade led to stable prices, eliminating one major incentive to join unions. Unemployment fell from 11.7 percent in 1921 to 2.4 percent in 1923 and remained in the range of 2 to 5 percent until 1930.

The 1920s also saw a lack of strong leadership within the labor movement. Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor died in 1924 after serving as the organization&#x27;s president for 37 years. Observers said successor William Green, who was the secretary-treasurer of the United Mine Workers, &quot;lacked the aggressiveness and the imagination of the AFL&#x27;s first president&quot;. The AFL was down to less than 3 million members in 1925 after hitting a peak of 4 million members in 1920.

Employers across the nation led a successful campaign against unions known as the &quot;American Plan&quot;, which sought to depict unions as &quot;alien&quot; to the nation&#x27;s individualistic spirit. In addition, some employers, like the National Association of Manufacturers, used Red Scare tactics to discredit unionism by linking them to subversive activities.

US courts were less hospitable to union activities during the 1920s than in the past. In this decade, corporations used twice as many court injunctions against strikes than any comparable period. In addition, the practice of forcing employees (by threat of termination) to sign yellow-dog contracts that said they would not join a union was not outlawed until 1932.

Although the labor movement fell in prominence during the 1920s, the Great Depression would ultimately bring it back to life.

===Battle of Blair Mountain===
The Battle of Blair Mountain, August 25, 1921 – September 2, 1921, was the largest labor uprising in United States history. The conflict occurred in Logan County, West Virginia, as part of the Coal Wars, a series of early-20th-century labor disputes in Appalachia.

For five days from late August to early September 1921, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers recruited and backed by coal mine operators during the miners&#x27; attempt to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The battle ended after the United States Army, represented by the West Virginia Army National Guard, intervened by presidential order, and the miners, many of whom were veterans, declined to shoot at the soldiers. In the short term the battle was an overwhelming victory for coal industry owners and management. United Mine Workers of America membership plummeted from more than 50,000 miners to approximately 10,000 over the next several years.

=== New England Textile Strike of 1922 ===

The New England Textile strike was widespread textile mill strike throughout New England, starting on January 23. Anywhere from 40,000 to 68,000 workers struck and it lasted until around November for most mills. The immediate cause was a proposal for a 20% wage cut and increased working hours. The strike led to a reversal of the wage cut for most workers.

===Great Railroad Strike of 1922===

The Great Railroad Strike of 1922, a nationwide railroad shop workers strike, began on July 1. The immediate cause of the strike was the Railroad Labor Board&#x27;s announcement that hourly wages for railway repair and maintenance workers would be cut by seven cents on July 1. This cut, which represented an average 12 percent wage decrease for the affected workers, prompted a shop workers vote on whether or not to strike. The operators&#x27; union did not join in the strike, and the railroads employed strikebreakers to fill three-fourths of the roughly 400,000 vacated positions, increasing hostilities between the railroads and the striking workers.

On September 1, a federal judge issued the sweeping &quot;Daugherty Injunction&quot; against striking, assembling, and picketing. Unions bitterly resented the injunction; a few sympathy strikes shut down some railroads completely. The strike eventually died out as many shopmen made deals with the railroads on the local level. The often unpalatable concessions — coupled with memories of the violence and tension during the strike — soured relations between the railroads and the shopmen for years.

==Organized labor, 1929–1955==

===The Great Depression and organized labor===

The stock market crashed in October 1929, and ushered in the Great Depression. By the winter of 1932–33, the economy was so perilous that the unemployment rate hit the 25 percent mark. Unions lost members during this time because laborers could not afford to pay their dues and furthermore, numerous strikes against wage cuts left the unions impoverished: &quot;one might have expected a reincarnation of organizations seeking to overthrow the capitalistic system that was now performing so poorly. Some workers did indeed turn to such radical movements as the Communist Party, but, in general, the nation seemed to have been shocked into inaction&quot;.

Though unions were not acting yet, cities across the nation witnessed local and spontaneous marches by frustrated relief applicants. In March 1930, hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers marched through New York City, Detroit, Washington, San Francisco and other cities in a mass protest organized by the Communist Party&#x27;s Unemployed Councils. In 1931, more than 400 relief protests erupted in Chicago and that number grew to 550 in 1932.

The leadership behind these organizations often came from radical groups like Communist and Socialist parties, who wanted to organize &quot;unfocused neighborhood militancy into organized popular defense organizations&quot;.

However the Great Depression spawned labor action in Harlan County, Kentucky, now known as the Harlan County War, when the Harlan County Coal Operators Association cut wages by 10% in the winter of 1931. This decision had caused the United Mine Workers to organize, leading to the eviction of the mine workers from the coal town. These evicted workers immigrated to the town of Evarts, Kentucky, where they would plan union activity. Sheriff J. H. Blair led a force of 140 deputies who were mostly paid by the coal company. Various skirmishes between striking miners and deputies ensued in Evarts. As the situation escalated, socialist organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World sent aid to the miners, giving it national coverage.

===The Norris–La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act of 1932===

Organized labor became more active in 1932, with the passage of the Norris–La Guardia Act. On March 23, 1932, Republican President Herbert Hoover signed the Norris–La Guardia Act, marking the first of many pro-union bills that Washington would pass in the 1930s. Also known as the Anti-Injunction Bill, it offered procedural and substantive protections against the easy issuance of court injunctions during labor disputes, which had limited union behavior in the 1920s. Although the act only applied to federal courts, numerous states would pass similar acts in the future. Additionally, the act outlawed yellow-dog contracts, which were documents some employers forced their employees to sign to ensure they would not join a union; employees who refused to sign were terminated from their jobs.

The passage of the Norris–La Guardia Act signified a victory for the American Federation of Labor, which had been lobbying Congress to pass it for slightly more than five years. It also marked a large change in public policy. Up until the passage of this act, the collective bargaining rights of workers were severely hampered by judicial control.

===FDR and the National Industrial Recovery Act===

President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office on March 4, 1933, and immediately began implementing programs to alleviate the economic crisis. In June, he passed the National Industrial Recovery Act, which gave workers the right to organize into unions. Though it contained other provisions, like minimum wage and maximum hours, its most significant passage was, &quot;Employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representative of their own choosing, and shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers.&quot;

This portion, which was known as Section 7(a), was symbolic to workers in the United States because it stripped employers of their rights to either coerce them or refuse to bargain with them. While no power of enforcement was written into the law, it &quot;recognized the rights of the industrial working class in the United States&quot;.

For example, the now United Mine Workers of America were able to reignite the coal labor movement in Kentucky and West Virginia with Section 7(a) and eliminated compulsory residence in company towns for 350,000 miners.

Although the National Industrial Recovery Act was ultimately deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935 and replaced by the Wagner Act two months after that, it fueled workers to join unions and strengthened those organizations.

In response to both the Norris–La Guardia Act and the NIRA, workers who were previously unorganized in a number of industries—such as rubber workers, oil and gas workers and service workers—began to look for organizations that would allow them to band together. The NIRA strengthened workers&#x27; resolve to unionize and instead of participating in unemployment or hunger marches, they started to participate in strikes for union recognition in various industries&quot;. In 1933, the number of work stoppages jumped to 1,695, double its figure from 1932. In 1934, 1,865 strikes occurred, involving more than 1.4 million workers.

The elections of 1934 might have reflected the &quot;radical upheaval sweeping the country&quot;, as Roosevelt won the greatest majority either party ever held in the Senate and 322 Democrats won seats in the United States House of Representatives versus 103 Republicans. It is possible that &quot;the great social movement from below thus strengthened the independence of the executive branch of government&quot;.

Despite the impact of such changes on the United States&#x27; political structure and on workers&#x27; empowerment, some scholars have criticized the impacts of these policies from a classical economic perspective. Cole and Ohanian (2004) find that the New Deal&#x27;s pro-labor policies are an important factor in explaining the weak recovery from the Great Depression and the rise in real wages in some industrial sectors during this time.

===The American Federation of Labor: craft unionism vs. industrial unionism===
The AFL was growing rapidly, from 2.1 million members in 1933 to 3.4 million in 1936. But it was experiencing severe internal stresses regarding how to organize new members. Traditionally, the AFL organized unions by craft rather than industry, where electricians or stationary engineers would form their own skill-oriented unions, rather than join a large automobile-making union. Most AFL leaders, including president William Green, were reluctant to shift from the organization&#x27;s long-standing craft unionism and started to clash with other leaders within the organization, such as John L. Lewis.

The issue came up at the annual AFL convention in San Francisco in 1934 and 1935, but the majority voted against a shift to industrial unionism both years. After the defeat at the 1935 convention, nine leaders from the industrial faction led by Lewis met and organized the Committee for Industrial Organization within the AFL to &quot;encourage and promote organization of workers in the mass production industries&quot; for &quot;educational and advisory&quot; functions.

The CIO, which later changed its name to the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), formed unions with the hope of bringing them into the AFL, but the AFL refused to extend full membership privileges to CIO unions. In 1938, the AFL expelled the CIO and its million members, and they formed a rival federation. The two federations fought it out for membership; while both supported Roosevelt and the New Deal, the CIO was further to the left, while the AFL had close ties to the big city machines.

===John L. Lewis and the CIO===

John L. Lewis (1880–1969) was the president of the United Mine Workers of America (UMW) from 1920 to 1960, and the driving force behind the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Using UMW organizers the new CIO established the United Steel Workers of America (USWA) and organized millions of other industrial workers in the 1930s.

Lewis threw his support behind Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) at the outset of the New Deal. After the passage of the Wagner Act in 1935, Lewis traded on the tremendous appeal that Roosevelt had with workers in those days, sending organizers into the coal fields to tell workers &quot;The President wants you to join the Union.&quot; His UMW was one of FDR&#x27;s main financial supporters in 1936, contributing over $500,000.

Lewis expanded his base by organizing the so-called &quot;captive mines&quot;, those held by the steel producers such as US Steel. That required in turn organizing the steel industry, which had defeated union organizing drives in 1892 and 1919 and which had resisted all organizing efforts since then fiercely. The task of organizing steelworkers, on the other hand, put Lewis at odds with the AFL, which looked down on both industrial workers and the industrial unions that represented all workers in a particular industry, rather than just those in a particular skilled trade or craft.

Lewis was the first president of the Committee of Industrial Organizations. Lewis, in fact, was the CIO: his UMWA provided the great bulk of the financial resources that the CIO poured into organizing drives by the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the United Steelworkers of America, the Textile Workers Union and other newly formed or struggling unions. Lewis hired back many of the people he had exiled from the UMWA in the 1920s to lead the CIO and placed his protégé Philip Murray at the head of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee.

The most dramatic success was the 1936-7 sit-down strike that paralyzed General Motors. It enabled CIO unionization of GM and the main automobile firms (except the Ford Motor Company, which held out for a few years). However it had negative ramifications, as the Gallup Poll reported, &quot;More than anything else the use of the sit-down strike alienated the sympathies of the middle classes&quot;.

The CIO&#x27;s actual membership (as opposed to publicity figures) was 2,850,000 for February 1942. This included 537,000 members of the auto workers (UAW), nearly 500,000 Steel Workers, almost 300,000 members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, about 180,000 Electrical Workers, and about 100,000 Rubber Workers. The CIO also included 550,000 members of the United Mine Workers, which did not formally withdraw from the CIO until later in the year. The remaining membership of 700,000 was scattered among thirty-odd smaller unions.

Historians of the union movement in the 1930s have tried to explain its remarkable success in terms of the rank and file—what motivated them to suddenly rally around leaders (such as John L. Lewis) who had been around for decades with little success. Why was the militancy of the mid-1930s so short lived?

===Union upsurge in World War II===

Union membership grew very rapidly from 2.8 million in 1933 to 8.4 million in 1941, covering 23% of the non-farm workforce, reaching 14 million in 1945, about 36 percent of the work force. By the mid-1950s, the merged AFL-CIO still collected dues from over 15 million members, a third of the non-farm workforce. Unionization was strongest in large northern cities, and weakest across the south, where repeated mobilization efforts failed. The 1937 split off of the CIO cost the AFL over a million members, but it added 760,000 on its own. Between 1937 and 1945 the CIO recruited two million new members, but the AFL recruited nearly 4 million. After some bitter battles in the late 1930s, the AFL and CIO had relatively few jurisdictional disputes, each focusing on its own specialized industries. The CIO was strongest in large manufacturing industries especially auto, steel, meatpacking, coal, and electrical appliances. The AFL affiliates were strongest in construction trades, trucking, department stores, and public service. The railway brotherhoods continued their independent status.

Both the AFL and CIO supported Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944, with 75 percent or more of their votes, after spending millions of dollars, and mobilizing tens of thousands of precinct workers.

However, Lewis opposed Roosevelt on foreign policy grounds in 1940, but his members ignored his advice to voted against FDR and he resigned as CIO chief. During the 22 months 1939-1941 when Stalin and Hitler supported each other, the far-left opposed American aid to Britain&#x27;s war against Germany. They called strikes in war industries that were supplying Lend Lease to Britain. The most dramatic case came in early June 1941, when a wildcat strike near Los Angeles closed the plant that produced a fourth of the fighter-planes. With the approval of CIO leadership, President Roosevelt sent in the national guard to reopen the plant. However, when Germany suddenly invaded the USSR in late June 1941, the Communist activists suddenly became the strongest supporters of war production; they crushed wildcat strikes.

Lewis realized that he had enormous leverage over the nation&#x27;s energy supply. In 1943, the middle of the war, when the rest of labor was observing a policy against strikes, Lewis led the coal miners out on a twelve-day strike for higher wages. The bipartisan Conservative coalition in Congress passed anti-union legislation over liberal opposition, most notably the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947.

A statistical analysis of the AFL and CIO national and local leaders in 1945 shows that opportunity for advancement in the labor movement was wide open. In contrast with other elites, the labor leaders did not come from established WASP families with rich, well-educated backgrounds. Indeed, they closely resembled the overall national population of adult men, with fewer from the South and from farm backgrounds. The union leaders were heavily Democratic. The newer CIO had a younger leadership, and one more involved with third parties, and less involved with local civic activities. Otherwise the AFL and CIO leaders were quite similar in background.

===Women take new jobs in World War II===

The war caused the military mobilization of 16 million American men, leaving a huge hole in the urban work force. (Men in farming were exempt from the draft.) In 1945, 37% of women were employed, encouraged by factors such as patriotism and the chance for high wages. One in 4 married women were working by 1945. Many domestic workers took jobs that paid much better, especially in war factories. During the war nearly 6 million women joined the workforce. They filled roles that men had monopolized, such as steel workers, lumber workers, and bus drivers. By 1945 there were 4.7 women in clerical positions which was an 89% increase from 1940. Another 4.5 million women working in factories, usually in unskilled positions, up 112%. The aviation industry saw the highest increase in female workers during the war. By 1943 310,000 women worked there, or 65% of the industry&#x27;s workforce.

While women&#x27;s wages rose more relative to men&#x27;s during this period, real wages did not increase due to higher wartime income taxes. Although jobs that had been previously closed to women opened up, demographics such as African American women who had already been participating more fully experienced less change. Their husbands&#x27; income effect was historically even more positive than white women&#x27;s. During the war, African American women engagement as domestic servants decreased from 59.9% to 44.6%, but Karen Anderson in 1982 characterized their experience as &quot;last hired, first fired.&quot;

At the end of the war, most of the munitions-making jobs ended. Many factories were closed; others retooled for civilian production. In some jobs, women were replaced by returning veterans who did not lose seniority because they were in service. However, the number of women at work in 1946 was 87% of the number in 1944, leaving 13% left the labor force to become housewives.

===Walter Reuther and UAW===

The Flint Sit-Down Strike of 1936–37 was the decisive event in the formation of the United Auto Workers Union (UAW).
During the war Walter Reuther took control of the UAW, and soon led major strikes in 1946. He ousted the Communists from the positions of power, especially at the Ford local. He was one of the most articulate and energetic leaders of the CIO, and of the merged AFL-CIO. Using brilliant negotiating tactics he leveraged high profits for the Big Three automakers into higher wages and superior benefits for UAW members.

===PAC and politics of 1940s===
New enemies appeared for the labor unions after 1935. Newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler was especially outraged by the New Deal&#x27;s support for powerful labor unions that he considered morally and politically corrupt. Pegler saw himself a populist and muckraker whose mission was to warn the nation that dangerous leaders were in power. In 1941 Pegler became the first columnist ever to win a Pulitzer Prize for reporting, for his work in exposing racketeering in Hollywood labor unions, focusing on the criminal career of William Morris Bioff. Pegler&#x27;s popularity reflected a loss of support for unions and liberalism generally, especially as shown by the dramatic Republican gains in the 1946 elections, often using an anti-union theme.

====Strike wave of 1945====

With the end of the war in August 1945 came a wave of major strikes, mostly led by the CIO. In November, the UAW sent their 180,000 GM workers to the picket lines; they were joined in January 1946 by a half-million steelworkers, as well as over 200,000 electrical workers and 150,000 packinghouse workers. Combined with many smaller strikes a new record of strike activity was set.

The results were mixed, with the unions making some gains, but the economy was disordered by the rapid termination of war contracts, the complex reconversion to peacetime production, the return to the labor force of 12 million servicemen, and the return home of millions of women workers. The conservative control of Congress blocked liberal legislation, and &quot;Operation Dixie&quot;, the CIO&#x27;s efforts to expand massively into the Southern United States, failed.

The Republican Party exploited public anger at the unions in 1946, winning a smashing landslide. Labor responded afterwards by taking strong actions. The CIO systematically purged communists and far-left sympathizers from leadership roles in its unions. The CIO expelled some unions that resisted the purge, notably its third-largest affiliate the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), and set up a new rival IUE to take away the UE membership.

Meanwhile, the AFL in 1947 set up its first explicitly political unit, Labor&#x27;s League for Political Education. The AFL increasingly abandoned its historic tradition of nonpartisanship, since neutrality between the major parties was impossible. By 1952, the AFL had given up on decentralization, local autonomy, and non-partisanship, and had developed instead a new political approach marked by the same style of centralization, national coordination, and partisan alliances that characterized the CIO. After these moves, the CIO and AFL were in a good position to fight off Henry Wallace in the 1948 presidential election and work enthusiastically for Harry S. Truman&#x27;s reelection. The CIO and AFL no longer had major points of conflict, so they merged amicably in 1955 as the AFL–CIO.

===Taft-Hartley Act===
The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, also known as the &quot;Taft–Hartley Act&quot;, in 1947 revised the Wagner Act to include restrictions on unions as well as management. It was a response to public demands for action after the wartime coal strikes and the postwar strikes in steel, autos and other industries that were perceived to have damaged the economy, as well as a threatened 1946 railroad strike that was called off at the last minute before it shut down the national economy. The Act was bitterly fought by unions, vetoed by President Harry S. Truman, and passed over his veto. Repeated union efforts to repeal or modify it always failed, and it remains in effect today.

The Act was sponsored by Senator Robert A. Taft and Representative Fred Hartley, both Republicans. Congress overrode the veto on June 23, 1947, establishing the act as a law. Truman described the act as a &quot;slave-labor bill&quot; in his veto, but after it was enacted over his veto, he used its emergency provisions a number of times to halt strikes and lockouts. The new law required all union officials to sign an affidavit that they were not Communists or else the union would lose its federal bargaining powers guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Board. (That provision was declared to be an unconstitutional bill of attainder by a 1965 Supreme Court decision, United States v. Brown.)

The Taft-Hartley Act amended the Wagner Act, officially known as the National Labor Relations Act, of 1935. The amendments added to the NLRA a list of prohibited actions, or &quot;unfair labor practices&quot;, on the part of unions. The NLRA had previously prohibited only unfair labor practices committed by employers. It prohibited jurisdictional strikes, in which a union strikes in order to pressure an employer to assign particular work to the employees that union represents, and secondary boycotts and &quot;common situs&quot; picketing, in which unions picket, strike, or refuse to handle the goods of a business with which they have no primary dispute but which is associated with a targeted business. A later statute, the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, passed in 1959, tightened these restrictions on secondary boycotts still further.

The Act outlawed closed shops, which were contractual agreements that required an employer to hire only union members. Union shops, in which new recruits must join the union within a certain amount of time, are permitted, but only as part of a collective bargaining agreement and only if the contract allows the worker at least thirty days after the date of hire or the effective date of the contract to join the union. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have added other restrictions on the power of unions to enforce union security clauses and have required them to make extensive financial disclosures to all members as part of their duty of fair representation. On the other hand, a few years after the passage of the Act Congress repealed the provisions requiring a vote by workers to authorize a union shop, when it became apparent that workers were approving them in virtually every case.

The amendments also authorized individual states to outlaw union security clauses entirely in their jurisdictions by passing &quot;right-to-work&quot; laws. Currently all of the states in the Deep South and a number of traditionally Republican states in the Midwest, Plains and Rocky Mountains regions have right-to-work laws.

The amendments required unions and employers to give sixty days&#x27; notice before they may undertake strikes or other forms of economic action in pursuit of a new collective bargaining agreement; it did not, on the other hand, impose any &quot;cooling-off period&quot; after a contract expired. Although the Act also authorized the President of the United States to intervene in strikes or potential strikes that create a national emergency, the President has used that power less and less frequently in each succeeding decade.

Historian James T. Patterson concludes that:
:: By the 1950s most observers agreed that Taft-Hartley was no more disastrous for workers than the Wagner Act had been for employers. What ordinarily mattered most in labor relations was not government laws such as Taft-Hartley, but the relative power of unions and management in the economic marketplace. Where unions were strong they usually managed all right; when they were weak, new laws did them little additional harm.

===Anti-communism===
The AFL had always opposed communists inside the labor movement. After 1945 they took their crusade worldwide. The CIO had major communist elements who played a key role in organizational work in the late 1930s and war years. By 1949 they were purged. The AFL and CIO strongly supported the Cold War policies of the Truman administration, including the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and NATO.

Left-wing elements in the CIO protested and were forced out of the main unions. Walter Reuther of the United Automobile Workers purged the UAW of communist members. He was active in the CIO umbrella as well, taking the lead in expelling eleven communist-dominated unions from the CIO in 1949.

As a leader of the anti-communist center-left, Reuther was a founder of the liberal umbrella group Americans for Democratic Action in 1947. In 1949 he led the CIO delegation to the London conference that set up the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in opposition to the communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions. He had left the Socialist Party in 1939, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s was a leading spokesman for liberal interests in the CIO and in the Democratic Party. James B. Carey also helped influence the CIO&#x27;s pullout from the WFTU and the formation of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions dedicated to promoting free trade and democratic unionism worldwide. Carey in 1949 had formed the International Union of Electrical Workers, a new CIO union for electrical workers, because the old one, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, was tightly held by the left.

Marxian economist Richard D. Wolff argues that anti-communism was part of a strategy by big business, Republicans and conservatives to single out and destroy the members of the coalition that forced through the New Deal, namely organized labor, socialist and communist parties.

==Union decline, 1955–2016==
Since its peak in the mid-20th century, the American labor movement has been in steady decline, with losses in the private sector larger than gains in the public sector. In the early 1950s, as the AFL and CIO merged, around a third of the American labor force was unionized; by 2012, the proportion was 11 percent, constituting roughly 5 percent in the private sector and 40 percent in the public sector. Organized labor&#x27;s influence steadily waned and workers&#x27; collective voice in the political process has weakened. Partly as a result, wages have stagnated and income inequality has increased. &quot;Although the National Labor Relations Act was initially a boon for unions, it also sowed the seeds of the labor movement&#x27;s decline. The act enshrined the right to unionize, but the system of workplace elections it created meant that unions had to organize each new factory or firm individually rather than organize by industry. In many European countries, collective-bargaining agreements extended automatically to other firms in the same industry, but in the United States, they usually reached no further than a plant&#x27;s gates. As a result, in the first decades of the postwar period, the organizing effort could not keep pace with the frenetic rate of job growth in the economy as a whole&quot;. On the political front, the shrinking unions lost influence in the Democratic Party, and pro-union liberal Republicans faded away. Intellectuals lost interest in unions, focusing their attention more on the Vietnam War, minorities, women and environmental issues.

By the 1970s, a rapidly increasing flow of imports (such as automobiles, steel and electronics from Germany and Japan, and clothing and shoes from Asia) undercut American producers. By the 1980s there was a large-scale shift in employment with fewer workers in high-wage sectors and more in the low-wage sectors. Many companies closed or moved factories to Southern states (where unions were weak). The effectiveness of strikes declined sharply, as companies after the 1970s threatened to close down factories or move them to low-wage states or to foreign countries. The number of major work stoppages fell by 97 percent from 381 in 1970 to 187 in 1980 to only 11 in 2010. The accumulating weaknesses were exposed when President Ronald Reagan—a former union president—broke the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) strike in 1981, dealing a major blow to unions.

Union membership among workers in private industry shrank dramatically, though after 1970 there was growth in employees unions of federal, state and local governments. The intellectual mood in the 1970s and 1980s favored deregulation and free competition. Numerous industries were deregulated, including airlines, trucking, railroads and telephones, over the objections of the unions involved.

Republicans, using conservative think tanks as idea farms, began to push through legislative blueprints to curb the power of public employee unions as well as eliminate business regulations.

Union weakness in the South undermined unionization and social reform throughout the nation, and such weakness is largely responsible for the anaemic US welfare state.

===AFL and CIO merger 1955===
The friendly merger of the AFL and CIO marked an end not only to the acrimony and jurisdictional conflicts between the coalitions, it also signaled the end of the era of experimentation and expansion that began in the mid-1930s. Merger became politically possible because of the deaths of Green of the AFL and Murray of the CIO in late 1952, replaced by George Meany and Reuther. The CIO was no longer the radical dynamo, and was no longer a threat in terms of membership for the AFL had twice as many members.

Furthermore, the AFL was doing a better job of expanding into the fast-growing white collar sector, with its organizations of clerks, public employees, teachers, and service workers. Although the AFL building trades maintained all-white policies, the AFL had more black members in all as the CIO. The problem of union corruption was growing in public awareness, and CIO&#x27;s industrial unions were less vulnerable to penetration by criminal elements than were the AFL&#x27;s trucking, longshoring, building, and entertainment unions. But Meany had a strong record in fighting corruption in New York unions, and was highly critical of the notoriously corrupt Teamsters.

Unification would help the central organization fight corruption, yet would not contaminate the CIO unions. The defeat of the New Deal in the 1952 election further emphasized the need for unity to maximize political effectiveness. From the CIO side the merger was promoted by David McDonald of the Steelworkers and his top aide Arthur J. Goldberg. To achieve the successful merger, they jettisoned the more liberal policies of the CIO regarding civil rights and membership rights for blacks, jurisdictional disputes, and industrial unionism. Reuther went along with the compromises and did not contest the selection of Meany to head the AFL-CIO.

Fearing the fallout of a drawn-out negotiation process, the AFL and CIO leadership decided on a &quot;short route&quot; to reconciliation. This meant all AFL and CIO unions would be accepted into the new organization &quot;as is,&quot; with all conflicts and overlaps to be sorted out after the merger. Negotiations were conducted by a small, select group of advisors. The draft constitution was primarily written by AFL Vice President Matthew Woll and CIO General Counsel Arthur Goldberg, while the joint policy statements were written by Woll, CIO Secretary-Treasurer James Carey, CIO vice presidents David McDonald and Joseph Curran, Brotherhood of Railway Clerks President George Harrison, and Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom.

===Conservative attacks===

Labor unions were a whole high-profile target of Republican activists throughout the 1940s and 1950s, especially the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. Both the business community and local Republicans wanted to weaken unions, which played a major role in funding and campaigning for Democratic candidates. The strategy of the Eisenhower administration was to consolidate the anti-union potential inherent in Taft-Hartley. Pressure from the Justice Department, the Labor Department, and especially from congressional investigations focused on criminal activity and racketeering in high-profile labor unions, especially the Teamsters Union. Republicans wanted to delegitimize unions by focusing on their shady activities. The McClellan Committee hearings targeted Teamsters president James R. Hoffa as a public enemy. Young Robert F. Kennedy played a major role working for the committee. Public opinion polls showed growing distrust toward unions, and especially union leaders — or &quot;labor bosses,&quot; as Republicans called them. The bipartisan Conservative Coalition, with the aid of liberals such as the Kennedy brothers, won new Congressional restrictions on organized labor in the form of the Landrum-Griffin Act (1959). The main impact was to force more democracy on the previously authoritarian union hierarchies. However, in the 1958 elections, taking place during a sharp economic recession, the unions fought back especially against state Right to Work laws and defeated many conservative Republicans.

The Teamsters union was expelled from the AFL for its notorious corruption under president Dave Beck. Its troubles gained national attention from highly visible Senate hearings. The target was Jimmy Hoffa (1913–1975), who replaced Beck and held total power until he was imprisoned in 1964.

===1960s: Liberal achievement in Civil Rights and backlash===

The UAW under Reuther played a major role in funding and supporting the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s. More traditional unions favored their white members and encountered federal court intervention.

After the smashing reelection victory of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, the heavily Democratic Congress passed a raft of liberal legislation. Labor union leaders claimed credit for the widest range of liberal laws since the New Deal era, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act of 1965; the War on Poverty; aid to cities and education; increased Social Security benefits; and Medicare for the elderly. The 1966 elections were an unexpected disaster, with defeats for many of the more liberal Democrats. According to Alan Draper, the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Action (COPE) was the main electioneering unit of the labor movement. It ignored the white backlash against civil rights, which had become a main Republican attack point. The COPE assumed falsely that union members were interested in issues of greatest salience to union leadership, but polls showed this was not true. The members were much more conservative. The younger ones were much more concerned about taxes and crime, and the older ones had not overcome racial biases. Furthermore, a new issue—the War in Vietnam—was bitterly splitting the New Deal coalition into hawks (led by Johnson and Vice-president Hubert Humphrey) and doves (led by Senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy).

===Hispanics===
====Chavez and the and United Farm Workers====

Hispanics form a large fraction of the farm labor force, but due to the fact that agricultural workers were not protected under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, there was little successful unionization before the arrival in the 1960s of Cesar Chavez (1927–1993) and Dolores Huerta (1930), who mobilized California workers into the United Farm Workers (UFW) organization.

Chavez&#x27;s use of non-violent methods combined with Huerta&#x27;s organizational skills allowed for many of the bigger successes of the organization.

A key success for the UFW was in partnering with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), which primarily worked with Filipino farm workers, and creating the eventual United Farmworkers Union in 1972. Together, they organized a worker strike and consumer boycott of the grape growers in California that lasted for over five years. Through collaboration with consumers and student protesters, the UFW was able to secure a three-year contract with the state&#x27;s top grape growers to increase the safety and pay of farm workers.

Chavez had a significant political impact; as Jenkins points out, &quot;state and national elites no longer automatically sided with the growers.&quot; Thus, the political insurgency of the UFW was successful because of effective strategizing in the right kind of political environment. In the decades following its early success, the UFW experienced a steep decline in membership due to purges of key organizational leaders by Chavez. With Chavez unable to lead effectively, the Teamsters Union moved in and replaced the UFW. In 2015 José-Antonio Orosco pointed out that the UFW, &quot;devolved from a powerful labor union for farmworkers to a fragile organization that today draws most of its support from mailed donations and represents fewer than five thousand workers in an industry that employs tens of thousands.&quot; In her biography of Chavez, Miriam Powell blames one person for the collapse: Chavez himself.

====Hotels====
Nationwide unions have been seeking opportunities to enroll Hispanic members. Much of their limited success has been in the hotel industry, especially in Nevada.

===Reagan era, 1980s===

Dana Cloud argues, &quot;the emblematic moment of the period from 1955 through the 1980s in American labor was the tragic PATCO strike in 1981.&quot; Most unions were strongly opposed to Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, despite the fact that Reagan remains the only union leader (or even member) to become president. On August 3, 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) union — which had supported Reagan — rejected the government&#x27;s pay raise offer and sent its 16,000 members out on strike to shut down the nation&#x27;s commercial airlines. They demanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a $10,000 bonus, pay raises up to 40 percent, and early retirement.

Federal law forbade such a strike, and the United States Department of Transportation implemented a backup plan (of supervisors and military air controllers) to keep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector.

Schulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, &quot;sent shock waves through the entire U.S. labor relations regime. ... strike rates plummeted, and union power sharply declined.&quot; Unions suffered a continual decline of power during the Reagan
administration, with a concomitant effect on wages. The average first-year raise (for 1000-plus–worker contracts) fell from 9.8 percent to 1.2 percent; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2 percent to negative 1.2 percent. Salaries of unionized workers also fell relative to non-union workers. Women and blacks suffered more from these trends.

===Decline of private sector unions===
By 2011 fewer than seven percent of employees in the private sector belonged to unions. The UAW&#x27;s numbers of automobile union members are representative of the manufacturing sector: 1,619,000 active members in 1970, 1,446,000 in 1980, 952,000 in 1990, 623,000 in 2004, and 377,000 in 2010 (with far more retired than active members).

By 2014, coal mining in the United States had largely shifted to open-pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only 60,000 active coal miners. The UMW has 35,000 members, of whom 20,000 were coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West Virginia. By contrast it had 800,000 members in the late 1930s. However it remains responsible for pensions and medical benefits for 40,000 retired miners, and for 50,000 spouses and dependents.
== Rise in union activity (2016–present) ==
The number of union members nationwide increased from 2016 to 2017, and some states saw union growth for the first time in several years or decades. Nearly half a million workers went on strike in 2018 and 2019, the largest numbers in three decades. Union growth in 2017 was primarily millennial workers. For instance, about 76 percent of new UAW union members during their increase came from workers under the age of 35. Although the total number of union members increased 1.7 percent in 2017, the Economic Policy Institute noted that year-to-year union membership often fluctuates due to hiring or layoffs in particular sectors, and cautioned against interpreting one-year changes as trends. The percentage of the workforce belonging to unions was 10.7 percent in 2017, unchanged over the previous year, but down from 11.1 percent in 2015, and 12.1 percent in 2007.

In recent years, efforts have also been made to extend the protections of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which excluded domestic workers and farm workers, to those groups on the state level. The National Domestic Workers&#x27; Alliance has successfully advocated for a Domestic Workers&#x27; Bill of Rights in New York, California, and Hawaii, while several states have passed legislation expanding the rights of farm workers.

On July 15, 2022, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reported that the amount of union representation petitions filed with the board increased by 58% in the first three quarters of the 2022 fiscal year. This was more than the total amount of petitions filed in the entire 2021 fiscal year.

=== Teacher strikes ===
In 2018, a series of statewide teacher strikes and protests happened garnering nationwide attention due to their success, as well as the fact that several of them were in states where public-employee strikes are illegal. Many of the major strikes were in Republican majority state legislatures, leading to the name &quot;Red State Revolt&quot;. Protests were held in Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. Additional smaller protests were held in Kentucky and North Carolina. The protests spread to a bus driver strike in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia, where nearly 250 bus drivers participated. The strikes included an adjunct faculty strike at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia, leading to an increase in adjunct wages.

===Unionization in the high tech sector===

The relatively new high tech sector, typically dealing with the creation, design, development, and engineering of computer hardware and software products, has typically not been unionized as it is considered white-collar jobs, often with high pay rates and benefits. There has been worker activism to try to get the employer to change their practices related to labor, such as a November 2018 walkout at Google by 20,000 employees to make the company change its policy on sexual harassment. However, these efforts have traditionally stopped short of the need for unionization, and achieving the scale of employee involvement to bring a union to their workplace can be difficult due to the numerous benefits these employees may already have and the blue-collar nature that union association may bring.

One area where unionization efforts have become more intense is in the video game industry. Numerous publicized events since 2004 have revealed the excessive use of &quot;crunch time&quot; at some companies; where there is a reasonable expectation in the industry that employees may be needed to put in more time near the release of a game product, some companies were noted for using a &quot;crunch time&quot; approach through much longer periods or as a constant expectation of their employees; further, most of those employed in the video game market are exempt from overtime, compounding the issue. Major grassroots efforts through the game industry since 2018 have promoted the creation of a new union or working with an existing union to cover the industry. One of the first high tech companies to establish a union was Kickstarter, whose employees voted in favor of unionizing in February 2020.

On April 1, 2022, Amazon workers at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York City voted in favor of a union, becoming Amazon&#x27;s first unionized workplace in the United States.

=== Hollywood labor disputes, 2023 ===

From May 2 to November 9, 2023, a series of long labor disputes within the film and television industries of the United States took place, mainly focused on the strikes of the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA.

=== Unionization in the food service and grocery industries ===
The food service industry has one of the lowest unionization rates in the United States, with just 1.2% of workers belonging to a union in 2020 and 2021.

==== Starbucks ====

In late 2021, a Starbucks store located in Buffalo, New York, became Starbucks&#x27; only unionized location among 9,000 stores in the United States, joining Workers United of the Service Employees International Union. A second location in Buffalo followed, winning an election certified by the NLRB in January 2022. During this time, the number of stores filing petitions to the NLRB grew to over ten locations, seven of them being outside of the Buffalo area.

The number of Starbucks stores that have decided to vote on unionization has since grown significantly. As of August 2022, 209 Starbucks locations have voted for unionization, with another 45 locations voting against unionization.

==== Trader Joe&#x27;s ====

In late July 2022, workers at a Trader Joe&#x27;s in Hadley, Massachusetts, voted to become the first unionized location in the grocery store chain&quot;.&quot; Workers at this location chose to create an independent union called Trader Joe&#x27;s United, and received administrative and legal support from already existing unions, but decided not to become a part of any larger established union. Two locations, one in Boulder, Colorado, and one in Minneapolis, also filed for unionization around this time. On August 12, 2022, the Minneapolis location went on to become the second store to unionize, joining Trader Joe&#x27;s United. Comparisons to the unionization efforts of Starbucks locations were made following the success of the Minneapolis vote, with workers of the two respective unions both publicly supporting one another.

As of September 23, 2022, workers in Brooklyn, New York, have petitioned for unionization with the NLRB, and would potentially become the third unionized location out of over 500 Trader Joe&#x27;s stores.

==== Chipotle ====
In late June 2022, a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant in Augusta, Maine, became the chain&#x27;s first location to petition for a union election, looking to organize independently as Chipotle United, citing issues regarding understaffing as well as crew and food safety. In that same month, Chipotle decided to permanently close the location, leading to workers filing a complaint with the NLRB and accusing Chipotle of union-busting. Chipotle has denied such claims, and have stated that the company was unable to provide enough staffing for the location.

In late August 2022, workers at a Chipotle in Lansing, Michigan, voted to unionize, becoming the fast food chain&#x27;s first union in the United States. Workers at this location voted 11 to three, opting to unionize with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

==Public-sector unions==

Labor unions generally ignored government employees because they were controlled mostly by the patronage system used by the political parties before the arrival of civil service.
Post Office workers did form unions. The National Association of Letter Carriers started in 1889 and grew quickly. By the mid-1960s it had 175,000 members in 6,400 local branches.

Several competing organizations of postal clerks emerged starting in the 1890s. Merger discussions dragged on for years, until finally the NFPOC, UNMAPOC and others merged in 1961 as the United Federation of Postal Clerks. Another round of mergers in 1971 produced the American Postal Workers Union (APWU). In 2012 the APWU had 330,000 members. The various postal unions did not engage in strikes.
Historian Joseph Slater, says, &quot;Unfortunately for public sector unions, the most searing and enduring image of their history in the first half of the twentieth century was the Boston police strike. The strike was routinely cited by courts and officials through the end of the 1940s.&quot; Governor Calvin Coolidge broke the strike and the legislature took control of the police away from city officials.

The police strike chilled union interest in the public sector in the 1920s. The major exception was the emergence of unions of public school teachers in the largest cities; they formed the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), affiliated with the AFL. In suburbs and small cities, the National Education Association (NEA) became active, but it insisted it was not a labor union but a professional organization.

===New Deal era===

In the mid-1930s efforts were made to unionize Works Progress Administration workers, but were opposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Moe points out that Roosevelt, &quot;an ardent supporter of collective bargaining in the private sector, was opposed to it in the public sector.&quot; Roosevelt in 1937 told the nation what the position of his government was: &quot;All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service... The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations.

===&quot;Little New Deal&quot; era===
Change came in the 1950s. In 1958 New York mayor Robert Wagner, Jr. issued an executive order, called &quot;the little Wagner Act,&quot; giving city employees certain bargaining rights, and gave their unions with exclusive representation (that is, the unions alone were legally authorized to speak for all city workers, regardless of whether or not some workers were members.) Management complained but the unions had power in city politics.

By the 1960s and 1970s public-sector unions expanded rapidly to cover teachers, clerks, firemen, police, prison guards and others. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 10988, upgrading the status of unions of federal workers.

===Recent years===
After 1960, public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.

In 2009, the US membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of private sector unions for the first time, at 7.9 million and 7.4 million respectively.

In 2011, states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack especially in Wisconsin, as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures. Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain. Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.

A 2023 study published by Oxfam found that the United States ranks among the worst among developed countries for labor protections, including the right to organize, ranking 32 out of 38 among OECD countries.

==Analysis==

According to labor historians, the US has the most violent labor history of any industrialized nation.

Some historians have attempted to explain why a labor party did not emerge in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe. Historian Gary Gerstle asserts that organized labor in the US was strongest when the fear of communism reached its peak, and the former&#x27;s decline coincided with the collapse of the latter. Gerstle argues that capitalist elites were much less willing to compromise with the working class once the threat of communism disappeared and neoliberal capitalism became the dominant global system. He emphasizes that this analysis is not meant to rehabilitate communist governments, which he describes as tyrannies.

<text>Peter Ellstrom Deuel (February 24, 1940 – December 31, 1971), known professionally as Pete Duel, was an American stage, television, and film actor, best known for his starring role as outlaw Hannibal Heyes (alias Joshua Smith) in the television series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;.

==Early life==

Duel was born in Rochester, New York, the eldest of three children born to Dr. Ellsworth and Lillian Deuel (née Ellstrom). His brother Geoffrey Deuel was also an actor, best known for his role in &quot;Chisum&quot; (1970) and numerous episodic television appearances of the 1960s and 1970s; their sister&#x27;s name was Pamela.

He attended Penfield High School, where he worked on the yearbook staff, campaigned for student government, and was a member of the National Thespians Society. He graduated in 1957 and attended St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, where he majored in English. He was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. He preferred performing in the drama department&#x27;s productions to studying for his classes during his two years there. When his father came to see him in &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;, he realized that his son was only wasting time and money at the university, and told him to follow a career in acting.

Moving to New York City, Duel landed a role in a touring production of the comedy &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot;. To find work in the movies, Duel and his mother drove across the country to Hollywood, California, in 1963, with only a tent to house them each night.

==Career==
In Hollywood, he found work in television, making small guest appearances in comedies such as &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; and dramas such as &quot;Channing&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, and &quot;Bonanza&quot;. In 1965, he was cast in the comedy series &quot;Gidget&quot; as Gidget&#x27;s brother-in-law, John Cooper; he appeared in 22 of the show&#x27;s 32 episodes.

After &quot;Gidget&quot;″s cancellation, Duel was quickly offered the starring role of Dave Willis, a newlywed apprentice architect, in the romantic comedy series &quot;Love on a Rooftop&quot;. Although the show earned good ratings, ABC decided not to bring it back after its first season. Duel wished to move from sitcoms to more serious roles. Around 1970, he changed the spelling of his last name from Deuel to Duel.

Duel appeared in &quot;The Psychiatrist&quot;, &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, and &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;; he also made feature films during this time, beginning with &quot;The Hell with Heroes&quot; in 1968, playing Rod Taylor’s best friend and co-pilot, Mike Brewer, followed the next year by &quot;Generation&quot;. After that film, he went to Spain to make &quot;Cannon for Cordoba&quot; (1970), a Western in which he played the mischievous soldier Andy Rice.

In 1970, Duel was cast as the outlaw Hannibal Heyes, alias Joshua Smith, opposite Ben Murphy&#x27;s Kid Curry, in &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, a light-hearted Western about the exploits of two outlaws trying to earn their amnesty. During the hiatus between the first and second seasons, he starred in the television production of Percy MacKaye’s 1908 play &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;.

According to Quentin Tarantino, Duel was one of the inspirations for the character of Rick Dalton in the film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;. In Tarantino&#x27;s novelization of the movie, Duel and Dalton worked together, &quot;enjoyed... each other&#x27;s company&quot; and were both &quot;undiagnosed bipolar.&quot;

==Personal life==
Duel became involved in politics during the primaries for the 1968 presidential election, campaigning for Eugene McCarthy, in opposition to the Vietnam War. He attended the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and witnessed the violence that erupted.

==Death==
In the early hours of Friday, New Years Eve 1971, Duel died at his Hollywood Hills home of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Duel&#x27;s girlfriend Dianne Ray was at his home at the time of his death and discovered his body. Ray later told police the couple had watched Duel&#x27;s series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; the previous evening. She later went to sleep in another room while Duel stayed up. Sometime after midnight, Duel entered the bedroom, retrieved his revolver and told Ray &quot;I&#x27;ll see you later.&quot; Ray then said she heard a gunshot from another room and discovered Duel&#x27;s body.

According to police, Duel&#x27;s friends and family said he was depressed about his drinking problem. He had been arrested and pleaded guilty to a driving under the influence accident that injured two people the previous June. Duel&#x27;s death was later ruled a suicide.

Duel&#x27;s funeral was held at the Self-Realization Fellowship Temple on January 2, 1972, in Pacific Palisades. At the service, his girlfriend Dianne Ray read a poem he wrote, titled &quot;Love&quot;. An estimated 1,000 friends and fans attended. His body was flown to Penfield, New York, where he was buried in Oakwood Cemetery.

After his death, his role in &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; was taken over by Roger Davis, who was previously the narrator over the opening theme of the show. The loss of Duel proved too great for the series to sustain and it
was canceled in early 1973.

<text>Salcombe is a resort town in the South Hams district of Devon, south west England. The town is close to the mouth of the Kingsbridge Estuary, mostly built on the steep west side of the estuary. It lies within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The town&#x27;s extensive waterfront and the naturally sheltered harbour formed by the estuary gave rise to its success as a boat and shipbuilding and sailing port and, in modern times, tourism especially in the form of pleasure boats and yachting. The town is also home to a traditional shellfish fishing industry. The town is part of the electoral ward of Salcombe and Malborough, for which the 2011 census recorded a total population of 3,353.

Kingsbridge Estuary (actually a ria or drowned valley) lies between Bolt Head and Sharpitor on the west and Portlemouth Down on the east, and runs inland for some . The estuary was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in February 1987 and is also a Local Nature Reserve.

== History ==
There are several shipwrecks off Salcombe. The oldest is of a Bronze Age ship, one of only three known in Britain, which had weapons and jewelry made in what is now France. The Salcombe Cannon Wreck is a 17th-century ship that contained 400 Moroccan gold coins and Dutch items. In 1936, a Finnish four-masted barque, &quot;Herzogin Cecilie&quot;, ran aground on the Ham Stone and was subsequently beached at Starehole Bay, near Bolt Head. Also off Salcombe is HMS &quot;Untiring&quot;, a World War II submarine, sunk in 1957 as a sonar target.

A description of the South Hams is given in the 9th-century charter S298. It does not refer to Salcombe but its area is part of Badestone (Batson). &quot;Salcombe&quot; first appears in the records in 1244, on the boundaries of Batson and West Portlemouth (Portlemore Barton). In 1570, there were 56 mariners, while two years later, another survey shows five ships under 60 tons at Salcombe.

In 1566, there were ten seine nets at Salcombe, while in the 1580s, Salcombe fishermen travelled to Padstow annually for the new herring fishery. While there, they rented cottages and storehouses.

The ruins of Fort Charles remain towards the south of the town. It was built for Henry VIII to defend the estuary. During the English Civil War, the town sided with the Royalists. From January to May 1646, the fort held out against the Roundheads and was the last Royalist stronghold. It was slighted on the orders of Parliament.

There is little record of the town between 1650 and 1750, but it is thought that the inhabitants lived by fishing and smuggling. In 1764, the first holiday home, The Moult, was built in Salcombe.

In the 19th century, Salcombe was a major centre for shipping in the fruit trade. Salcombe vessels sailed to Iberia, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean as well as to the Azores and Newfoundland. The fruit cargoes were oranges and lemons from the Azores, and pineapples from the Bahamas and West Indies. Other cargoes brought back included sugar, rum, coconuts and shaddocks (pomelos). In addition, wood such as ebony and mahogany was brought for furnishing ships. Salcombe and Kingsbridge were busy ship-building locations, producing the Salcombe schooner, which was a fast boat that could be sailed with few hands. However, almost half the fleet was lost with all hands. A mutual marine assurance association had been established in 1811 to insure Salcombe ships.

The Salcombe fleet also was involved in the coastal trade, supplying coal from Wales and taking away cider, malt, grain and slates. A ferry to Brest was set up in 1870 but did not last.

By 1871, the central part of Salcombe, excluding the outlying districts, numbered 776 people, with 34 shipwrights and 13 ship&#x27;s carpenters. There were also five sawyers, three block makers, two ship&#x27;s riggers, three sail makers, a tin plate worker and four blacksmiths. However, in the 1870s, the fruit trade declined due to outbreaks of orange and pineapple disease, as well as the advent of steamships. Some work was found taking salt to Newfoundland and returning with cod but, by 1914, there were only three or four locally owned trading ships in the estuary. At that time, pleasure sailing began at Salcombe, with the yacht club being founded in 1894. One of the boats raced was the Salcombe Yawl for which an owner&#x27;s association has been set up.

Salcombe became a ship registry port in 1864, but still came under Dartmouth for customs purposes. A customs house was later built at Salcombe which still exists. Between 1796 and 1887, at least 200 vessels were launched from Salcombe. To provide more space, the shipyards were extended by reclaiming the foreshore, but they were later built over and new ones constructed in Shadycombe Creek. However, many vessels were lost, including seven local boats off the Azores in November 1851. There were four sailmakers lofts at Salcombe and three shipsmiths in 1851. The majority of the Victorian houses seen in Salcombe today were built by shipowners and masters. After 1880, with the advent of steam propulsion and larger ships, there was less new construction and repair work. Salcombe&#x27;s seamen and craftsmen moved to the deep-sea fishing ports or to the dockyards.

A turnpike road was built to Salcombe in 1824. Originally, Salcombe was part of Malborough parish but a chapel-of-ease was built at Salcombe in 1401. The parish church was not built until the 19th century. The population of Salcombe was 972 in 1841, but had risen to about 1500 by 1850. There is also a Wesleyan Chapel and a Catholic church.

Between the two world wars, Salcombe developed as a holiday resort, with Salcombe Sailing Club being founded in 1922.

During the Second World War, a radar station was set up on Bolt Head, and Salcombe became an Advance Amphibious Base for the United States Navy in September 1943. The Salcombe Hotel became the latter&#x27;s headquarters and 60 other properties were requisitioned, and Quonset huts were built on the hill near the Rugby Club. As well, Whitestrand Quay and slipway were constructed. 137 officers and 1793 men were based at Salcombe. 66 ships and many auxiliary vessels sailed from Salcombe on 4 June 1944, as part of &quot;Force U&quot; which landed on Utah Beach, Normandy. Afterwards, Shadycombe Creek and Mill Bay were used to repair damaged landing craft. The base closed on 7 May 1945, and a plaque was set up in Normandy Way to commemorate the United States Navy. Salcombe and district suffered a number of bombing raids during the war.

The former radar station at Bolt Head, near Salcombe, was set up to be used as the Regional Seat of Government in the event of attack during the Cold War. It has now been dismantled.

There have been many changes to the Salcombe Waterfront since World War II, the most noticeable being the construction of the Creek car and boat park, and the road to Batson. Salcombe became an urban district following an Act of Parliament in 1972.

==Marine facilities and activities==
===Harbour===
The Pier and Harbour Order (Salcombe) Confirmation Act 1954 established the harbour as a statutory harbour under local authority ownership (i.e. a municipal port) and conferred powers on the urban district council of Salcombe (which was later to be incorporated into the South Hams District Council) to &quot;authorize the Council to construct works to maintain manage and improve the said harbor and estuary and to levy tolls rates and charges and for other purposes.&quot;

In 2014 the European Sea Ports Organisation awarded the harbour Eco-Port status.

=== Bar and RNLI lifeboat ===
Towards the mouth of the estuary is the Bar, a spit of sand protruding from the east bank which is exposed at low spring tides. In this state of tide and with strong southerly winds the bar can make the entrance to the estuary dangerous.

It is believed that Lord Tennyson&#x27;s famous poem &quot;Crossing the Bar&quot; was inspired by a visit to Salcombe during the 19th century. The poem begins with the lines,
The moaning refers to the noise of the water breaking over The Bar. Salcombe Lifeboat Station was established by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1869. In 1916 the Salcombe lifeboat, an open rowboat &quot;The William and Emma&quot;, capsized crossing The Bar resulting in 13 of the 15 crew&#x27;s lives being lost. However another crew was soon formed and the station continues to this day. There is all-weather boat and an inshore boat. The original lifeboat station on South Sands is no longer used and there is a lifeboat museum and shop in Salcombe town, at the lifeboat station itself.

===Beaches===
Further into the estuary on the east side is a series of popular sandy beaches: Sunny Cove (nearest the bar), the large Mill Bay, Cable Cove (the landing point of a cross-channel cable), Small&#x27;s Cove and Fisherman&#x27;s Cove. Adjacent to Fisherman&#x27;s Cove is a landing slip used by the ferry — open-topped clinker-built motorboats — from Salcombe directly across the estuary, communicating with the hamlet of East Portlemouth. From here there is access to the South West Coast Path.

Opposite the Bar on the west side of the estuary are the beaches of South Sands and North Sands. A picturesque ferry operates between Salcombe and South Sands, with a Sea Tractor ferrying passengers between the boat and the South Sands beach. South Sands beach has been awarded the coveted Blue Flag Beach status for several years. The adjacent North Sands and Mill Bay beaches share the same high standards of cleanliness and water quality but have not sought the award because of cost considerations.

North of North Sands Salcombe town begins, occupying the steep west side of the estuary opposite the beaches and East Portlemouth and extending north and west into the first of the estuary&#x27;s many creeks: Batson Creek by Snapes Point. Others, including Southpool Creek and Frogmore Creek, branch off to the east and north east, while the main channel continues to Kingsbridge itself. A larger boat operates in the summer as a ferry between Salcombe and Kingsbridge when the state of the tide permits. Salcombe now also has spread down the west side of &quot;The Berry&quot; below the main road to Malborough.

===Sailing and other marine-based activities===

Although Salcombe harbour hosts a small but active shell fishing fleet of approximately 20 boats (the largest of which is less than 20m in length) the harbour is primarily a recreational leisure port which accommodates approximately 1600 residential yachts and power vessels, and which welcomes around 6,000 visiting vessels a year (2015 figures). There are no commercial vessels which ply their trade in this harbour, predominantly because the Bar at the harbour entrance limits the maximum draught (and hence size) of visiting vessels. The estuary is a relatively sheltered body of water upon which a wide variety of marine pursuits take place: Standup Paddleboarding, kayaking, yacht and dinghy sailing and racing are popular activities, as is swimming from one of the many beaches within the estuary. The harbour has inspired its own class of dinghy known as the Salcombe Yawl.

===Salcombe Sailing Regatta===

Salcombe Yacht Club hosts the Salcombe Yacht Club Regatta every August, attracting up to 400 dinghies in 10 or more dinghy classes plus handicap fleets. The Salcombe Yawls take pride of place as they were all designed and built in Salcombe using traditional boatbuilding techniques. The sailing regatta classes include: Fast &amp; Asymmetric Handicap, RS200, Medium Handicap, Enterprise, Larks, Laser Standard, Laser Radial, Topper, Junior Handicap, National Twelve, Salcombe Yawls, Solos and Cruisers.

===Salcombe Town Regatta===
The Salcombe Town Regatta and sailing regatta form a very popular and busy fortnight in Salcombe. The order in which they run switches each year and usually coincides with favourable tidal conditions for the various events.

The Salcombe Town Regatta is the busiest week in the calendar year. Family friendly events include mud races, the cross harbour swim, fun-run, rowing races, swimming gala, sandcastle competition, fishing competition, water treasure hunt, land-based treasure hunt, spot the bloomer, crabbing competition, fireworks, Crabbers Race, torchlight procession, children&#x27;s sports and family fun day, fancy dress parade and air displays. Occasionally the Red Arrows are booked to perform over the estuary.

==Economy==
Due to its unspoiled beauty, sandy beaches and harbour facilitating sailing and yachting, Salcombe has one of the highest average property prices in the UK, soaring above Sandbanks, Poole in recent years. Many of the shops, bars and restaurants in the town, especially towards the waterfront, cater for a predominantly well-off, fashionable and nautically-inclined clientele, with prices to match. There are many clothes shops and art galleries. Salcombe has hotels and bed and breakfast establishments as well as self-contained apartments and houses which help its population soar from approximately 1900 in the winter months to nearly 25,000 during the height of the summer.

Salcombe has a number of boatyards and marine stores, while boats are stored on the carpark by the fishing quay during the winter. There is a power boat school and SCUBA diving is popular, although consent from the harbour office must first be obtained to ensure safety. The town and yacht club regatta weeks are one of the main features of the summer season. There are races for dingies and yachts as well as crabbers in addition to other activities. Salcombe Estuary Rowing Club is a member of the Cornish Pilot Gig Association and takes part in races around the south west.

Fishing is still carried out at Salcombe, mostly of shellfish. About 2,000 tons a year were landed between 1986 and 1990.

The Marine Hotel was bought in 2012 by the Harbour Hotel Group and transformed into the Salcombe Harbour Hotel at a reported cost of £12million. In 2012, Galliford Try Building Ltd. was appointed by Estura on a construction project at the hotel, in which the customer failed to submit a payment notice on time in accordance with the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, leading to the court case of Galliford Try Building Ltd v Estura Ltd. This is one of the leading cases on construction payment law in the UK. Fourteen villas and apartments were constructed in front of the refurbished hotel and sold off-plan in 2012-2014 at prices were from £1.2 to £2.85 million. Some villas are used exclusively by the owners and others are rented out as holiday lets.

Stores include Fat Face, Joules, Musto, Henri Lloyd and White Stuff. Fashion brand Jack Wills was founded in 1999 at 22 Fore Street.

Salcombe is also home to &quot;Cranches&quot;, the oldest sweetshop in Devon.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Caradon Hill the local relay TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon on 103.4 FM, Heart West on 101.2 FM and Greatest Hits Radio South West on 105.5 FM.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Kingsbridge &amp; Salcombe Gazette which publishes on Fridays.

==Facilities==
Because of the narrow streets and the priority given to pedestrians, a park and ride scheme operates during the summer from the outskirts of Salcombe. This service does not operate in the off-peak season but is instead signposted as &#x27;park and walk&#x27;. A small airfield, Bolt Head Airfield, is located 1 mile southwest of the town centre - the site was previously occupied by RAF Bolt Head during the Second World War.

The Salcombe Maritime Museum, founded in 1975, has information on the fruit schooners and other items of interest. Since 1991, the museum has occupied the ground floor of the former council offices. Temporary exhibitions are arranged each summer mainly with loaned items.

By South Sands is Overbeck&#x27;s a house and gardens belonging to the National Trust. In the house are inventions of Otto Overbeck.

Salcombe has numerous walking routes nearby and is on the South West Coast Path. It is also on the National Cycle Network route 28 from Okehampton to Plymouth.

Other facilities include a gin distillery known as Salcombe Gin.

===Sports===
A 20m outdoor heated swimming pool forms part of the Salcombe Primary School and is open during the summer season. The rugby club on Camperdown Road is a centre of activities during the winter. Salcombe Town Football Club, re-formed in 2010, play their home games in the nearby village of Malborough.

===Sailing Facilities===
Salcombe has many facilities for visiting boats. Fuel barge, showers, drinking water and more.

<text>Watchet is a harbour town, civil parish and electoral ward in the county of Somerset, England, with a population in 2011 of 3,785. It is situated west of Bridgwater, north-west of Taunton, and east of Minehead. The town lies at the mouth of the Washford River on Bridgwater Bay, part of the Bristol Channel, and on the edge of Exmoor National Park.

The original settlement may have been at the Iron Age fort, Daw&#x27;s Castle. It then moved to the mouth of the river and a small harbour developed. After the Saxon conquest of the area the town developed, becoming known as Weced or Waeced, and was attacked by Vikings in the 10th century. Trade using the harbour gradually grew, despite damage during several severe storms, with import and exports of goods including those from Wansbrough Paper Mill until the 19th century when it increased with the export of iron ore, brought from the Brendon Hills via the West Somerset Mineral Railway, mainly to Newport for onward transportation to the Ebbw Vale Steelworks. 

The West Somerset Railway also served the town and port bringing goods and people from the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The iron ore trade reduced, finally ceasing in the early 20th century. The port continued a smaller commercial trade until 2000 when it was converted into a marina. In 2016, Watchet joined the rest of West Somerset in receiving &#x27;Opportunity Area&#x27; status.

The church is dedicated to Saint Decuman who is thought to have died here around 706. An early church was built near Daw&#x27;s Castle and a new church was erected in the 15th century. It has several tombs and monuments to Sir John Wyndham and his family who were the lords of the manor. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, which was written in the area, is commemorated by a statue on the harbourside.

East Quay Watchet is a purpose-built art gallery and arts centre that opened in 2021.

==Etymology==
The name of Watchet is attested in a number of charters and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle during the tenth century, in the Old English forms &quot;weced&quot;, &quot;wæced&quot;, and &quot;wæcet&quot;. It appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wacet&quot;. Twenty-first-century authorities mostly agree that the name comes from the Common Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as - (&quot;under-&quot;) and (&quot;woodland&quot;). Thus the name once meant &quot;under the wood&quot;.

==History==
Daw&#x27;s Castle (&quot;Dart&#x27;s Castle&quot; or &quot;Dane&#x27;s Castle&quot;) is an Iron Age sea cliff hill fort about to the west of the town. It was built and fortified, on the site of an earlier settlement, as a &quot;burh&quot; by Alfred the Great, as part of his defences against Viking raids from the Bristol Channel around 878 AD. It is situated on an east–west cliff about above the sea, on a tapering spur of land bounded by the Washford River to the south. Its ramparts would have formed a semicircle backing on to the sheer cliffs, but only about are visible today. A Saxon mint was established here in 1035, probably within the fort. It is a scheduled monument.

There is no sign of Roman occupation, but the Anglo-Saxons took Watchet from the native Britons around AD 680. Under Alfred the Great (AD 871−901) Watchet became an important port, and coins minted here have been found as far away as Copenhagen and Stockholm. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records the early port being plundered by Danes led by Earl Ottir and a &#x27;Hroald&#x27; (possibly Ottir&#x27;s king Ragnall) in 987 and 997.
Watchet is believed to be the place where Saint Decuman was killed around 706 and its parish church is dedicated to him. At the time of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; Watchet was part of the estate held by William de Moyon. The parish of Watchet was in the Williton and Freemanners Hundred in the Middle Ages. T

With access to wood from the Quantock Hills, records show that paper making was established by 1652. In the 15th century, a flour mill was established by the Fulford and Hadley families near the mouth of the Washford River. By 1587 the Wyndham estate had established a fulling and grist mill to the south west. By 1652, the mill had started to produce paper. In 1846 business partners James Date, William Peach and John Wansbrough bought the business and introduced mechanised-production using a water wheel-powered pulley system. 

In the 1860s, the factory was converted to steam power and the local harbour was used to import raw materials and export finished goods. Most of the mill was destroyed by fire in 1889, but it was rebuilt, and less than ten years later five paper-making machines were operating. The mill became the largest manufacturer of paper bags in the UK. In 1896, the business became the Wansbrough Paper Company, a limited liability company, and the building became known as the Wansbrough Paper Mill. With an annual capacity of 180,000 tonnes of product and employing 100 people, it was the UK&#x27;s largest manufacturer of coreboard, and also produced containerboard, recycled envelope, bag and kraft papers. In December 2015 the paper mill ceased production and closed.

===Harbour===

Watchet developed as a town thanks to its closeness to the minerals within the Brendon Hills, and its access to the River Severn for onward shipping. Aside from local ships plying trade across the river, from 1564 onwards the port was used for import of salt and wine from France. 

In 1643 during the English Civil War, a Royalist ship was sent to Watchet to reinforce for the siege of Dunster Castle. Parliamentarian (Roundhead) Captain Popham ordered his troops into the sea with the tide on the ebb, and with the ship unable to move, attacked the ship with fire from their carbines. Taken by surprise and under heavy attack, the Royalist commander surrendered the ship, resulting in a ship technically at sea being captured by troops on horseback.

The primitive jetty was damaged in a storm of 1659, so that in 1708 leading local wool merchant Sir William Wyndham built a new harbour costing £1,000, with a stronger pier. The main export at this time was kelp, made by burning seaweed for use in glass making. In the 19th century trade increased with the export of iron ore from the Brendon Hills mainly to Newport for onward transportation to the Ebbw Vale Steelworks, paper, flour and gypsum. In 1843 the esplanade was built by George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont, and in 1855 a new harbour was commissioned to cope with increased iron ore trade. The existing harbour was damaged and several vessels wrecked by the &quot;Royal Charter&quot; Storm on 26 October 1859. A new east pier and wharf was completed in 1861−62 by James Abernethy. This allowed shipping movement to reach a peak, with over 1,100 ship movements per annum. Harbour trade was aided by the coming of the railway, with two independent railways terminating at Watchet from the mid 1860s. The West Somerset Mineral Railway ran down from the iron mines on the Brendon Hills, and the West Somerset Railway came up from the Bristol and Exeter Railway at Norton Fitzwarren. At the peak in the trade during the late 19th century 40,000 tons of ore were exported annually.
In 1862, the cast-iron Watchet Harbour Lighthouse was built by Hennet, Spinks and Else of Bridgwater. In September 2012, Princess Anne unveiled a plaque to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the lighthouse. The mines and West Somerset Mineral Railway closed in 1898. The West Somerset Railway, extended from Watchet to Minehead in 1874, survived as part of British Rail until 1971. Reopened as a heritage railway, it still operates today. In 1900 and 1903 a series of gales breached the breakwater and East Pier with the loss of several vessels each time and subsequent repairs.

After the First World War, the Cardiff Scrap and Salvage company Ltd. took a lease on part of the harbour, from 1920 to 1923. In autumn 1923, the company scrapped the second class protected cruiser HMS &quot;Fox&quot; of the &quot;Astraea&quot;-class of the Royal Navy, which at is still the largest vessel ever to enter the harbour. Before the Second World War, a gunnery range was established for various army units to practice anti-aircraft gunnery at a site between Watchet and Doniford. Unmanned target aircraft were towed by planes from RAF Weston Zoyland, and later were fired from catapults over the sea. Little of the camp buildings survives, and it is now the site of a holiday park.

The port remained open to service the papermills, importing wood pulp and esparto grass from Russia and Scandinavia, using mainly East European registered vessels after the Second World War. Requiring a return load, the result was that Watchet became a leading UK port for the export of car parts, tractors and other industrial goods. However, with the replacement of coal with oil from the mid-1960s, the port traffic began to terminally decline. The harbour was in commercial use until 2000, it has now been converted into a marina for pleasure boats. It is surrounded by renovated quaysides and narrow streets. The commercial esplanade has been refurbished with new shelters, information points, and the provision of new paving in some areas, as well as railings, lamps, curved benches, planters and new tree plantings. 

There are several museums in the town, including the Market House Museum, which explores the history of the town and its harbour. The building was constructed in 1820 on the site of the previous market house which had been demolished in 1805. It was converted into a museum in 1979. It houses a collection of exhibits about the natural history of Watchet and the surrounding area. The focus is on nautical and maritime history of the port. Artefacts include those relating to: Archaeology, Coins and Medals, Land Transport, Maritime, Natural Sciences, Science and Technology and Social History. At the rear of the museum building is the old town lock-up for the temporary detention of people, often drunks who were usually released the next day or to hold people being brought before the local magistrate. The Watchet Boat Museum, which is housed in the 1862 Victorian architecture former railway goods shed, displays the unusual local flatner boats and associated artefacts.

===Lifeboat===
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Watchet in 1875. The station was closed in 1944 by which time the nearby station at had been equipped with a motor lifeboat that could cover the area around Watchet. The boat was launched from the slipway at the western corner of the harbour, but the boat house was at the southern corner near the railway station and the boat was taken along the quay on a carriage.

The building was gifted to the town in 1951 and opened as a library in May 1953. In 2019 the ownership was transferred from the county council to Watchet town council.

==Governance==
The civil parish of Watchet is governed by a town council, (having previously been Watchet Urban District), and by Somerset Council, a unitary authority that on 1 April 2023 took over local government functions previously provided by the Somerset West and Taunton local government district and the Somerset shire county. In 2011, the parish had a population of 3,785.

Watchet forms part of the Tiverton and Minehead county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of parliament (MP) by the First-past-the-post system of election. Liberal Democrat, Rachel Gilmour was elected to represent the constituency at the 2024 general election. Until Brexit in 2020, residents of Watchet formed part of the electorate for the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.

==Geography==

The foreshore at Watchet is rocky, with a high tidal range. The cliffs between Watchet and Blue Anchor show a distinct pale, greenish blue colour, resulting from the coloured alabaster found there. The name &quot;Watchet&quot; or &quot;Watchet Blue&quot; was used in the 16th century to denote this colour. A fragment of a lower jaw from a Phytosaur &quot;longirostrine archosaur&quot; has been described from early Hettangian strata.

Kentsford Bridge is a packhorse bridge over the Washford River. It existed before the Reformation, possibly being a route to Cleeve Abbey and was repaired in 1613. The bridge is wide and has a total span of .

==Culture==
Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; was written in 1797 whilst travelling through Watchet and the surrounding area. He lived at Coleridge Cottage in Nether Stowey and while living there he wrote &quot;This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison&quot;, part of &quot;Christabel&quot;, &quot;Frost at Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.

It is claimed that the sight of harbour, from St. Decuman&#x27;s Church, was the primary inspiration for Coleridge to start the poem. In September 2003, a commemorative statue, by Alan B Herriot of Penicuik, Scotland, was unveiled at the harbour.

Local traditions include Lantern Night, which is held on 16 September and involves children in the town with candle lanterns made from hollowed out root vegetables such as mangelwurzel or swede. It was the last remaining reminder of the Watchet Fair (also known as St Decuman&#x27;s Fair). Another tradition is Queen Caturn&#x27;s Day on the last Saturday of November. Watchet was famous for its blue dye and Queen Caturn was so impressed she bestowed the town&#x27;s folk with cider and cakes as a reward for this. The tradition is carried on with costumes and celebrations.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset on 95.5 FM, Heart West on 102.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 102.4 FM, and West Somerset Radio, community based radio station that broadcast from the town on 104.4 FM.

The town is served by local newspapers, West Somerset Free Press and Somerset County Gazette.

==Transport==
Adjacent to the harbour is Watchet station. This is now an intermediate stop on the West Somerset Railway, a largely steam-operated heritage railway that links Bishops Lydeard, near Taunton, with Minehead. The station was first opened on 31 March 1862, when the West Somerset Railway was opened from Norton Junction. The station was built as a terminus, for part of the commercial aim of the WSR was to provide a wider and cheaper distribution route for goods from the then major port of Watchet. The line was extended westwards by the Minehead Railway Company on 16 July 1874, with an industrial railway siding provided at the same time into the Wansbrough Paper Mill. The GWR undertook many projects to increase the capacity of the line in the 1930s. Nationalisation in 1948 saw the GWR become the Western Region of British Railways. Freight traffic was withdrawn on 6 July 1964, and passenger trains on 4 January 1971. The station was reopened by the new West Somerset Railway on 28 August 1976.
The harbour was also linked, with a separate station, to the independent West Somerset Mineral Railway, that ran to iron ore mines in the Brendon Hills south west of the town. From Watchet the ore was carried across the Bristol Channel by ship to Newport and thence to Ebbw Vale for smelting to extract the iron. The line was ready for traffic from Watchet to Roadwater by April 1857, Although the outward terminal of the line was to be the quay at Watchet, the pier had been practically unusable for some considerable time, and boats were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500 ton vessels could enter the harbour. Passenger services were also provided from Watchet, however these were not financially successful and with the declining output from the Iron ore mines the line closed in 1898. It briefly reopened in the early 20th century.

The trackbed of the old West Somerset Mineral Railway now forms a path, which can be followed from the harbour at Watchet to Washford station, also on the West Somerset Railway.

==Education==
The Knights Templar Church of England/Methodist Community School in Liddymore Road was built in 1990. It takes its name from the land on which it was built which was owned by the Knights Templar. Middle and an upper schools are available in Williton and Minehead including The West Somerset Community College, which provides education for 1298 students between the ages of 13 and 18.

==Religious sites==

The Anglican St Decuman&#x27;s church is probably on an ancient pre-Christian site, on a hill top between Watchet and Williton. An earlier church was situated by the sea at Daw&#x27;s Castle (probably the original site of Watchet) but was abandoned because of sea erosion. When the church was rebuilt in the 12th century it appears that the bones of St Decuman were moved. The chancel of the present church is unusually wide and may have housed the tomb of St Decuman. The &quot;Translation of Saint Decuman&quot; used to be celebrated. The 15th century, Grade I listed, Church of St Decuman is dedicated to him. The Norman church was rebuilt in the 15th and 16th centuries when the central tower was demolished and the present one built at the west end. It was restored and reseated by James Piers St Aubyn between 1886 and 1891, with further internal alterations being made in 1896 when the Caen stone reredos was erected.

The church was described by Francis Carolus Eeles (&quot;St Decuman&#x27;s Church&quot;) in 1932. He highlighted a fine geometrical east window with original tracery dating from the end of the 13th century and the perpendicular window tracery in the south isle. The series of wagon roofs with rich carving are above the rood screen in the nave and south aisle. The Wyndham Chapel occupies the east end of the north aisle and is dedicated to the Wyndham family of nearby Orchard Wyndham House, former lords of the manor. Included is a memorial to Sir John Wyndham (1558–1645), who played an important role in the establishment of defence organisation in the West Country against the threat of the Spanish Armada. Next to his monument is one to his parents, and the chest tomb of his grandparents, with monumental brasses, serves to separate the chapel from the chancel. A mural monument exists with kneeling effigies of two of Sir John&#x27;s sons, Henry and George, as well as other monuments to the later family of Wyndham. The organ was presented to the church in 1933 by W. Wyndham.

St Decuman&#x27;s well is below the church. It is a 19th-century reconstruction of the earlier well on the site which dates from the Middle Ages. In addition to the Church of St Decumen there is also a Methodist church in Watchet. It was built as a Wesleyan chapel in 1871. The Baptist church was built in 1824. Cleeve Abbey, one of the best preserved medieval monasteries in England, lies about west of Watchet, in the village of Washford.

<doc id="408195" wikidata="Q769374" url="?curid=408195" title="Cauchy principal value">
<text>In mathematics, the Cauchy principal value, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a method for assigning values to certain improper integrals which would otherwise be undefined. In this method, a singularity on an integral interval is avoided by limiting the integral interval to the non singular domain. 

==Formulation==
Depending on the type of singularity in the integrand , the Cauchy principal value is defined according to the following rules:


In some cases it is necessary to deal simultaneously with singularities both at a finite number and at infinity. This is usually done by a limit of the form
formula_1

In those cases where the integral may be split into two independent, finite limits,
formula_2
and
formula_3

then the function is integrable in the ordinary sense. The result of the procedure for principal value is the same as the ordinary integral; since it no longer matches the definition, it is technically not a &quot;principal value&quot;.

The Cauchy principal value can also be defined in terms of contour integrals of a complex-valued function formula_4 with formula_5 with a pole on a contour . Define formula_6 to be that same contour, where the portion inside the disk of radius around the pole has been removed. Provided the function formula_7 is integrable over formula_6 no matter how small becomes, then the Cauchy principal value is the limit:
formula_9

In the case of Lebesgue-integrable functions, that is, functions which are integrable in absolute value, these definitions coincide with the standard definition of the integral.

If the function formula_7 is &quot;meromorphic&quot;, the Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem relates the principal value of the integral over with the mean-value of the integrals with the contour displaced slightly above and below, so that the residue theorem can be applied to those integrals.

Principal value integrals play a central role in the discussion of Hilbert transforms.

== Distribution theory ==

Let formula_11 be the set of bump functions, i.e., the space of smooth functions with compact support on the real line formula_12. Then the map
formula_13
defined via the Cauchy principal value as
formula_14
is a distribution. The map itself may sometimes be called the principal value (hence the notation p.v.). This distribution appears, for example, in the Fourier transform of the sign function and the Heaviside step function.

===Well-definedness as a distribution===
To prove the existence of the limit 
formula_15
for a Schwartz function formula_16, first observe that formula_17 is continuous on formula_18 as
formula_19
and hence 
formula_20
since formula_21 is continuous and L&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s rule applies.

Therefore, formula_22 exists and by applying the mean value theorem to formula_23 we get:
:formula_24

And furthermore:
:formula_25

we note that the map
formula_26
is bounded by the usual seminorms for Schwartz functions formula_27. Therefore, this map defines, as it is obviously linear, a continuous functional on the Schwartz space and therefore a tempered distribution.

Note that the proof needs formula_28 merely to be continuously differentiable in a neighbourhood of 0 and formula_29 to be bounded towards infinity. The principal value therefore is defined on even weaker assumptions such as formula_28 integrable with compact support and differentiable at 0.

===More general definitions===

The principal value is the inverse distribution of the function formula_31 and is almost the only distribution with this property:
formula_32
where formula_33 is a constant and formula_34 the Dirac distribution.

In a broader sense, the principal value can be defined for a wide class of singular integral kernels on the Euclidean space formula_35. If formula_33 has an isolated singularity at the origin, but is an otherwise &quot;nice&quot; function, then the principal-value distribution is defined on compactly supported smooth functions by
formula_37
Such a limit may not be well defined, or, being well-defined, it may not necessarily define a distribution. It is, however, well-defined if formula_33 is a continuous homogeneous function of degree formula_39 whose integral over any sphere centered at the origin vanishes. This is the case, for instance, with the Riesz transforms.

==Examples==
Consider the values of two limits:
formula_40

This is the Cauchy principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression
formula_41

Also:
formula_42

Similarly, we have
formula_43

This is the principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression
formula_44
but
formula_45

==Notation==

Different authors use different notations for the Cauchy principal value of a function formula_46, among others:
formula_47
formula_48
formula_49
formula_50
as well as formula_51 P.V., formula_52 formula_53 formula_54 formula_55 and V.P.

<text>Langholm , also known colloquially as the &quot;Muckle Toon&quot;, is a burgh in Dumfries and Galloway, southern Scotland. Langholm lies between four hills in the valley of the River Esk in the Southern Uplands.

==Location and geography==
Langholm sits north of the Anglo-Scottish border on the A7 road running between Edinburgh and Carlisle. Edinburgh is to the north, Newcastleton is around to the east and Carlisle to the south.

Langholm is surrounded by four hills in the River Esk valley within Scotland&#x27;s wider Southern Uplands. The highest of the four hills is 300 m high Whita hill on which stands an obelisk (locally known as &#x27;The Monument&#x27;). The Monument commemorates the life and achievements of Sir John Malcolm (1769‑1833), former soldier, statesman, and historian. The other three hills are Warblaw (in Langholm it is pronounced Warbla), Meikleholmhill (a knowe of which is known as &#x27;Timpen&#x27;) and the Castle Hill.
The two longest B roads in the UK both start (or finish) in Langholm. The B6318 which goes to Heddon-on-the-Wall and is long, and the B709 which joins the A7 near Heriot after .

== History==
Langholm was founded in 1455 during the Battle of Arkinholm.

A fort at nearby Langholm Castle was occupied by English soldiers during the war known as the Rough Wooing. Thomas Wharton reported that at the end of April 1543, the soldiers burnt farms at Whitslade in Teviotdale. There were plans to modify the tower by reducing its height to place artillery. Regent Arran successfully besieged the fort in July 1547 and then travelled to the siege of St Andrews Castle to meet a French force.

Langholm is the traditional seat of Clan Armstrong, which is currently represented globally by the official Clan Armstrong Trust. Home of the Clan Armstrong line is Gilnockie Tower south of Langholm and north of Canonbie. The Episcopalian church on Castle Holm went into disuse before conversion into the Clan Armstrong museum, later moved to Gilnockie Tower.

The town was an important centre for the Border Reivers. The town later grew around the textile industry. Langholm Town Hall was completed in 1813.

In 2020, the local community purchased 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) of Langholm Moor for £3.8m from Buccleuch Estates.

==Governance==
Langholm is in the parliamentary constituency of Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, David Mundell is the current Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP).

The town is part of the South Scotland region in the Scottish Parliament, being in the constituency of Dumfriesshire. Oliver Mundell of the Conservatives is the MSP.

Prior to Brexit for the European Parliament, Langholm was part of the Scotland constituency.

Langholm is part of the Annandale East and Eskdale ward for both Dumfries and Galloway Council and Dumfries and Galloway Youth Council. The ward is represented by 3 Councillors (2x Con &amp; 1x Lab) and 2 Youth Councillors.

The town is also part of the Dumfriesshire constituency for the Scottish Youth Parliament and is represented by 2 Members of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYPs).

==Notable visitors and residents==
===Neil Armstrong===
In 1972, astronaut Neil Armstrong was welcomed and made the first freeman and Burgess of the burgh. The depute town clerk at the time later said, “The town council had made the approach because this is Armstrong country and we thought it would be appropriate. It turned out that he was coming to Edinburgh to deliver the Mountbatten lecture so he could accept and come to Langholm.”

The ceremony took place at Langholm&#x27;s largest building of the time, the parish church. With his manner of modest dignity he stated: 

He also commented:

:”My pleasure is not only that this is the land of Johnnie Armstrong, rather that my pleasure is in knowing that this is my home town and in the genuine feeling that I have among these hills among these people.”

He then walked for lunch at Buccleuch Hall. His visit is captured in online video. In coverage by the international press, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s front-page story included a map of the British Isles marking only London and Langholm. Armstrong, universally known for his humility is remembered as having no interest on his visit of boasting of his achievements. Instead he was absorbed in finding out more of his Armstrong heritage and making a connection with the area.

===Others===
The civil engineer and road builder Thomas Telford was born nearby, and worked in Langholm as an apprentice early in his career.

Christopher Murray Grieve (known as Hugh Macdiarmid) was born in Langholm. The Scottish poet was a leading light in the Scottish Renaissance of the 20th century. Unusual for a communist, he was a committed Scottish nationalist and wrote both in English and in literary Scots. The town is home to a monument in his honour made of COR-TEN(r) steel, which takes the form of a large open book depicting images from his writings.

The first female corporate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Dorothy Donaldson Buchanan, was born and raised in Langholm, daughter of Rev. James Donaldson Buchanan, the longtime minister in Langholm Parish.

David Thomas Richardson, a linguist and officer of the Bengal Army was born in Langholm.

Dave Stevenson, Olympic pole vaulter (1964 Tokyo Games) and businessman, was raised in the burgh and his company was based there.

==Economy==

Edinburgh Woollen Mill was founded in Langholm in 1946 by Drew Stevenson, however they moved their headquarters from Langholm to Carlisle in 2019.

Buccleuch Estates have an office in Langholm and own much of the surrounding land.

== Transport ==
===Bus===
The X95 cross-border bus service (which is operated by Borders Buses) runs through Langholm, the service largely follows the route of the A7 road between Edinburgh and Carlisle via Hawick + Galashiels in the Scottish Borders.

===Rail===
Langholm railway station opened in April 1864, but closed 100 years later. The last regular passenger train was on 13 June 1964, although a special ran in March 1967; complete with restaurant car; the freight service continued until September 1967.

The nearest operational railway stations are at in England and in Scotland.

==Local media ==
===Newspaper===
The local newspaper is the &quot;Eskdale &amp; Liddesdale Advertiser&quot; based on Langholm High Street. The &quot;Advertiser&quot; was owned by the CN Group Ltd. The paper covers news from Langholm and its surrounding areas (notably Canonbie &amp; Newcastleton) and is commonly referred to locally as &#x27;The Squeak&#x27;. Established in 1848, the newspaper was the first penny newspaper in Scotland.

== Education ==
Langholm Academy and Langholm Primary were established in the 1800s (the original building of which still stands).

The schools run sessions in the community with various groups such as Wild Eskdale and Outpost Arts to expand and improve pupils&#x27; skills and community interests.

== Sport ==
In 1858 Langholm Cricket Club was founded. The club play their matches on the Castleholm Ground. They currently play their matches in the Border League.

In 1871, Langholm RFC was founded, being the oldest Rugby club in the Borders. Langholm RFC play in East Regional League Division One and in the Border League.

Langholm also has a minor football team, Langholm Legion, who also play on the Castleholm

The town also has a karate club, Langholm Shotokan Karate Club, which is part of the JKS Scotland.

Langholm Scouts (2nd Dumfriesshire) has been running for many decades, with some members attending the biggest events in Scouting, including the World Scout Jamboree and Blair Atholl Jamborette.

== Arts and leisure ==

As well as the Scottish Episcopal Church now used as the Clan Armstrong museum, The Roman Catholic church of St Francis of Assisi closed in 2010 and is now a fine art gallery.

The Buccleuch Centre, is a well equipped venue with providing a regular programme of music and theatre.

The town is home to a music and arts festival, a food festival and the Langholm walks. Each year the annual Common Riding, takes place on the last Friday of July which features horse riding, sports, dancing and musical processions by the Pipe and Town Bands.

Langholm has both a pipe band and a brass band (known as the Town Band - or colloquially as The Toon Ban&#x27;). The Town Band is the oldest continuous brass band in Scotland and has won many national awards.

The town is also home to the Eskdale and Liddesdale Archaeological Society.

The Langholm Archive Group has a collection of information, photographs etc. about the locality.

== Langholm Project ==
The &#x27;Langholm Project&#x27; or &#x27;Langholm Study&#x27; is a reference to the Joint Raptor Study, a scientific study undertaken in the 1990s on Langholm Moor into the effects of raptors on red grouse populations. This was a large-scale project involving a range of organisations including Game Conservancy Trust, CEH (or ITE as they were then known) and Buccleuch estates. The project was followed by a two-year study on the effects of supplementary feeding of harriers, which ended in 1999. The findings of the study and the effect on the moor have been the subject of much debate. In 2007 the Scottish Government announced a further 10-year project with the following aims:

* aim to establish a commercially viable driven grouse moor. Within the time frame of the project, it is the intention to sell driven grouse days producing an annual income in excess of £100,000.
* aim to restore an important site for nature conservation to favourable condition
* seek to demonstrate whether the needs of an economically viable grouse moor can be met alongside the conservation needs of protected raptors, especially the hen harrier.
This more recent study is officially titled The Langholm Moor Demonstration Project, but like its predecessor it is generally known as &#x27;the Langholm Project&#x27;.
The current project is a joint venture between Buccleuch Estates, Scottish Natural Heritage, Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust, RSPB and Natural England.

<text>The king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa) is a large bird found in Central and South America. It is a member of the New World vulture family Cathartidae. This vulture lives predominantly in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. It is the only surviving member of the genus Sarcoramphus, although fossil members are known.

Large and predominantly white, the king vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail feathers. The head and neck are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures have been known to live for up to 30 years in captivity.

King vultures were popular figures in the Mayan codices as well as in local folklore and medicine. Although currently listed as Least Concern by the IUCN, they are decreasing in number, due primarily to habitat loss.

== Etymology, taxonomy, and systematics ==
The king vulture was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Vultur papa&quot;, the type specimen originally collected in Suriname. It was reassigned to the genus &quot;Sarcoramphus&quot; in 1805 by French zoologist André Marie Constant Duméril. The generic name is a Neo-Latin compound formed from the Greek words σάρξ (&quot;sarx&quot;, &quot;flesh&quot;, the combining form of which is σαρκο-) and ῥάμφος (&quot;rhamphos&quot;, &quot;crooked beak of bird of prey&quot;). The genus name is often misspelled as &quot;Sarcorhamphus&quot;, improperly retaining the Greek rough breathing despite agglutination with the previous word-element. The bird was also assigned to the genus &quot;Gyparchus&quot; by Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger in 1841, but this classification is not used in modern literature since &quot;Sarcoramphus&quot; has priority as the earlier name. The species name is derived from the Latin word &quot;papa&quot; &quot;bishop&quot;, alluding to the bird&#x27;s plumage resembling the clothing of one. The king vulture&#x27;s closest living relative is the Andean condor, &quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;. Some authors have even put these species in a separate subfamily from the other New World vultures, though most authors consider this subdivision unnecessary.

There are two theories on how the king vulture earned the &quot;king&quot; part of its common name. The first is that the name is a reference to its habit of displacing smaller vultures from a carcass and eating its fill while they wait. An alternative theory reports that the name is derived from Mayan legends, in which the bird was a king who served as a messenger between humans and the gods. This bird was also known as the &quot;white crow&quot; by the Spanish in Paraguay. It was called &quot;cozcacuauhtli&quot; in Nahuatl, derived from &quot;cozcatl&quot; &quot;collar&quot; and &quot;cuauhtli&quot; &quot;bird of prey&quot;.

The exact systematic placement of the king vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in &quot;Incertae sedis&quot;, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World vultures, the king vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.

=== Fossil record and evolution ===
The genus &quot;Sarcoramphus&quot;, which today contains only the king vulture, had a wider distribution in the past. The Kern vulture (&quot;Sarcoramphus kernense&quot;), lived in southwestern North America during the mid-Pliocene (Piacenzian), some 3.5–2.5 million years ago). It was a little-known component of the Blancan/Delmontian faunal stages. The only material is a broken distal humerus fossil, found at Pozo Creek, Kern County, California. As per Loye H. Miller&#x27;s original description, &quot;[c]ompared with [&quot;S. papa&quot;] the type conforms in general form and curvature except for its greater size and robustness.&quot; The large span in time between the existence of the two species suggests that the Kern vulture might be distinct, but as the fossil is somewhat damaged and rather non-diagnostic, even assignment to this genus is not completely certain. During the Late Pleistocene, another species probably assignable to the genus, &quot;Sarcoramphus fisheri&quot;, occurred in Peru. A supposed king vulture relative from Quaternary cave deposits in Cuba turned out to be bones of the eagle-sized hawk &quot;Buteogallus borrasi&quot; (formerly in &quot;Titanohierax&quot;).

Little can be said of the evolutionary history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group, especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and notably the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the &quot;S. fisheri – S. papa&quot; lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.

=== Bartram&#x27;s &quot;painted vulture&quot; ===
A &quot;painted vulture&quot; (&quot;Sarcoramphus sacra&quot; or &quot;S. papa sacra&quot;) is described in William Bartram&#x27;s notes of his travels in Florida during the 1770s. This bird&#x27;s description matches the appearance of the king vulture except that it had a white, not black, tail. Bartram describes the bird as being relatively common and even claimed to have collected one. However, no other naturalists recorded the painted vulture in Florida and sixty years after the sighting, its validity began to be questioned, leading to what John Cassin described as the most inviting problem in North American ornithology. An independent account and painting was made of a similar bird by Eleazar Albin in 1734.

While most early ornithologists defended Bartram&#x27;s honesty, Joel Asaph Allen argued that the painted vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed elements of different species to create this bird. Allen pointed out that the birds&#x27; behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara&#x27;s. For example, Bartram observed the birds following wildfires to scavenge for burned insects and box turtles. Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking. The crested caracara (&quot;Caracara cheriway&quot;) was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram&#x27;s days, but it is notably absent from Bartram&#x27;s notes if the painted vulture is accepted as a &quot;Sarcoramphus&quot;. However, Francis Harper argued that the bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.

Harper noticed that Bartram&#x27;s notes were considerably altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the detail of the white tail appeared in print for the first time in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of the king vulture, or a close relative, in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.

== Description ==
Excluding the two species of condors, the king vulture is the largest of the New World vultures. Its overall length ranges from and its wingspan is . Its weight ranges from . An imposing bird, the adult king vulture has predominantly white plumage, which has a slight rose-yellow tinge to it. In stark contrast, the wing coverts, flight feathers, and tail are dark grey to black, as is the prominent thick neck ruff. The head and neck are devoid of feathers, the skin shades of red and purple on the head, vivid orange on the neck, and yellow on the throat. On the head, the skin is wrinkled and folded, and there is a highly noticeable irregular golden crest attached to the cere above its orange and black bill; this caruncle does not fully form until the bird&#x27;s fourth year.

The king vulture has, relative to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill, of the New World vultures. This bill has a hooked tip and a sharp cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The irises of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red sclera. Unlike some New World vultures, the king vulture lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.
The vulture is minimally sexually dimorphic, with no difference in plumage and little in size between males and females. The juvenile vulture has a dark bill and eyes, and a downy, gray neck that soon begins to turn the orange of an adult. Younger vultures are a slate gray overall, and, while they look similar to the adult by the third year, they do not completely molt into adult plumage until they are around five or six years of age. Jack Eitniear of the Center for the Study of Tropical Birds in San Antonio, Texas reviewed the plumage of birds in captivity of various ages and found that ventral feathers were the first to begin turning white from two years of age onwards, followed by wing feathers, until the full adult plumage was achieved. The final immature stages being a scattered black feathers in the otherwise white lesser wing coverts.

The vulture&#x27;s head and neck are featherless as an adaptation for hygiene, though there are black bristles on parts of the head; this lack of feathers prevents bacteria from the carrion it eats from ruining its feathers and exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of the sun.

Dark-plumaged immature birds may be confused with turkey vultures, but soar with flat wings, while the pale-plumaged adults could feasibly be confused with the wood stork, although the latter&#x27;s long neck and legs allow for easy recognition from afar.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The king vulture inhabits an estimated between southern Mexico and northern Argentina. In South America, it does not live west of the Andes, except in western Ecuador, north-western Colombia and far north-western Venezuela. It primarily inhabits undisturbed tropical lowland forests as well as savannas and grasslands with these forests nearby. It is often seen near swamps or marshy places in the forests. This bird is often the most numerous or only vulture present in primary lowland forests in its range, but in the Amazon rainforest, it is typically outnumbered by the greater yellow-headed vulture, while typically outnumbered by the lesser yellow-headed, turkey, and American black vulture in more open habitats. King vultures generally do not live above , although are found in places at altitude east of the Andes, and have been rarely recorded up to They inhabit the emergent forest level, or above the canopy. Pleistocene remains have been recovered from Buenos Aires Province in central Argentina, over south of its current range, giving rise to speculation on the habitat there at the time which had not been thought to be suitable.

== Ecology and behavior ==

The king vulture soars for hours effortlessly, only flapping its wings infrequently. While in flight, its wings are held flat with slightly raised tips, and from a distance the vulture can appear to be headless while in flight. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed it could be a part of courtship behaviour.

Despite its size and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite inconspicuous when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black vulture, it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed on a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is a significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though a male transferred from the Sacramento Zoo to the Queens Zoo is over 47 years old. Vivian, a female King Vulture at Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, TX, turned 70 years old in 2022 and is the oldest known King Vulture in an AZA-accredited facility. Their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture&#x27;s eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.

=== Breeding ===
The reproductive behaviour of the king vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is about four or five years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. A king vulture mates for life and generally lays a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, able to beg and wriggle around the nest, preen themselves, and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10 and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.

=== Feeding===
The king vulture eats anything from cattle carcasses down to corpses of monkeys and other arboreal mammals to beached fish and dead lizards. In densely forested areas, mammals likely
to be included are many of the abundant sloths (&quot;Choloepus&quot;/&quot;Bradypus&quot;) whose combined ranges coincide largely with that of this vulture, but elsewhere it has adapted well to domestic livestock. Principally a carrion eater, there are isolated reports of it killing and eating injured animals, newborn calves, and small lizards. Although it locates food by vision, the role smell has in how it specifically finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been that it does not detect odours, and instead follows the smaller turkey and greater yellow-headed vultures, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass, but a 1991 study demonstrated that the king vulture could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an olfactory sense. The king vulture primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a carcass, the king vulture displaces the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill. However, when it is at the same kill as the larger Andean condor, the king vulture always defers to it. Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh carcass. This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a carcass, access to the carcass after the king vulture has fed. The vulture&#x27;s tongue is rasp-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass&#x27;s bones. Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal. The king vulture has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the moriche palm when carrion is scarce in Bolívar state, Venezuela.

== Conservation ==
This bird is a species of least concern to the IUCN, with an estimated range of and between 10,000 and 100,000 wild individuals. However, there is evidence that suggests a decline in population, though it is not significant enough to cause it to be listed. This decline is due primarily to habitat destruction and poaching. Although distinctive, its habit of perching in tall trees and flying at high altitudes renders it difficult to monitor.

== Relationship with humans ==

The king vulture is one of the most common species of birds represented in the Maya codices. Its glyph is easily distinguishable by the knob on the bird&#x27;s beak and by the concentric circles that make up the bird&#x27;s eyes. Sometimes the bird is portrayed as a god with a human body and a bird head. According to Maya mythology, this god often carried messages between humans and the other gods. It may also be used to represent Cozcacuauhtli, the thirteenth day of the month in the Aztec calendar (13 Reed). An ocellated turkey (&quot;Meleagris ocellata&quot;) was also considered to be the bird depicted, but the hooked bill and wattle point to the raptor.

The bird&#x27;s blood and feathers were also used to cure diseases. The king vulture is also a popular subject on the stamps of the countries within its range. It appeared on a stamp for El Salvador in 1963, Belize in 1978, Guatemala in 1979, Honduras in 1997, Bolivia in 1998, and Nicaragua in 1999.

Because of its large size and beauty, the king vulture is an attraction at zoos around the world. The king vulture is one of several bird species with an AZA studbook, which is kept by Shelly Collinsworth of the Fort Worth Zoo.

<doc id="408199" wikidata="Q1016904" url="?curid=408199" title="Kingussie">
<text>Kingussie ( ; ) is a small town in the Badenoch and Strathspey ward of the Highland council area of Scotland. Historically in Inverness-shire, it lies beside the A9 road, although the old route of the A9 serves as the town&#x27;s main street which has been bypassed since 1979. Kingussie is south of Inverness, south of Aviemore, and north of Newtonmore.

== History ==

The name &quot;Kingussie&quot; comes from the Gaelic, &quot;Ceann a&#x27; Ghiuthsaich&quot; which means &quot;Head of the Pine forest&quot;.

The ruins of the early 18th-century Ruthven Barracks (Historic Environment Scotland; open to visitors at all times) lie near the original site of the village, which was moved to avoid the flood plain of the River Spey. The Hanoverian Barracks were built on the site of Ruthven Castle, the seat of the Comyns, Lords of Badenoch in the Middle Ages.

On 9 January 2025 two lynx were captured after being sighted near to Kingussie, Scotland. They were put in quarantine at Highland Wildlife Park with plans to transfer them to Edinburgh Zoo. It is thought that the animals were illegally released. On 10 January police reported that two more lynx were seen and captured in the same area.

=== Gaelic ===
Despite the more recent language shift to Highland English, the community is important to both the history of Scottish Gaelic literature and to that of Scottish traditional music. Firstly, the Gaelic Bard (c.1730-1825) lived out his old age in Kingussie. 

Fr. Ranald Rankin (c.1785-1863), formerly an outlawed &quot;heather priest&quot; for the Catholic Church in Scotland and the lyricist of the famous Scottish Gaelic Christmas carol &quot;Tàladh Chrìosda&quot;, was assigned to Kingussie. It was during the aftermath of Catholic Emancipation in 1829 and Fr. Rankin worked very hard to raise money to build the first post-Reformation Catholic parish church in Badenoch, but was transferred to Moidart in 1838, well before it was completed.

According to census data, 53.9% of the residents of Kingussie spoke Gaelic in 1891. This number fell sharply at the turn of the century, and now only about 1.8% of the population report any proficiency in the language in 2001. As a result, scholar Kent C. Duwe terms it a part of the &quot;Gaelic diaspora, showing only slightly higher language incidence than the national mean.&quot;

== Shinty==

According to the Guinness Book of Records 2005, Kingussie is the world sport&#x27;s most successful sporting team of all time, winning 20 consecutive leagues and going 4 years unbeaten at one stage in the early 1990s.

== Tourism ==
The main railway line to Inverness passes through from Edinburgh, Glasgow and points south. Kingussie railway station is about southeast of the High Street. In the early 2000s, the TV series &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; was filmed in and around the area of Kingussie. Ardverikie Estate, where &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; was filmed, is about from Kingussie.

The Highland Wildlife Park is close by. The Highland Folk Museum is in Newtonmore, from Kingussie. Kingussie is at the centre of a network of well maintained and waymarked footpaths; one of the most popular walks in the area is the ascent to Creag Bheag, a prominent hill overlooking its centre.

== Education ==
There are two schools located in Kingussie. There is Kingussie Primary School, situated just off the High Street at the southern end of the village, which caters for children in Nursery and P1-P7 (around age 3 to age 12). After P7, most children will normally then transfer to the local Kingussie High School. The school building dates from 1876. The current school roll is 16 children in Nursery and 84 primary school pupils.

Kingussie High School is the secondary school in Kingussie. It serves pupils from S1-S7 (which is usually around age 11 or 12, depending on when the child was born, to age 18). There are six associated primary schools, Aviemore, Alvie (Kincraig), Dalwhinnie, Gergask (Laggan), Kingussie and Newtonmore. Primary 7 pupils from these associated schools will automatically transfer to Kingussie High School after summer, unless the pupil moves to another catchment area, or gets a placement request accepted at another school. There are records to suggest that there has been a secondary school in Kingussie since the time of the Columban missionaries, but the current building dates from 1970. A new extension was built and originally was supposed to be finished in February 2013, and, after another delay in August, officially opened on 20 September 2013. The extension added 9 more classrooms, a new entrance, a new social area, more car parking space, as well as a new Pupil Support Unit, which caters for pupils with additional support needs or pupils who need more support with their learning or attendance in school. Before the new Pupil Support Unit extension was built, many pupils with complex needs had to go outside the Badenoch and Strathspey area for their education. The current school roll is estimated at over 400 pupils, although this figure is expected to rise to over 500 in the coming years. The school motto is &quot;Du Dichiollach&quot;, which is Gaelic for &quot;with diligence&quot;.

== Speyside Way ==
The Speyside Way is a long-distance route which currently has its southern terminus at Aviemore, north of Kingussie. There is, however, a proposed extension to the route to Newtonmore, going through Kingussie on the way. See the link below for more information:

== Culture ==

=== Film ===
Kingussie featured in the 8-time Oscar-winning Danny Boyle film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;.

=== Literature ===
Kingussie is mentioned in Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s book &quot;The Monarch of the Glen&quot;, on which the BBC TV series was loosely based. In chapter 8 Kingussie Sanatorium, now St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, is mentioned. In Ali Smith&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;Spring&quot;, four protagonists meet at Kingussie station.

== Football ==
Although the village is more famous for its Shinty club, it also has a successful football side which plays its games in the local Strathspey &amp; Badenoch Welfare FA.

<text>A sieve, fine mesh strainer, or sift is a tool used for separating wanted elements from unwanted material or for controlling the particle size distribution of a sample, using a screen such as a woven mesh or net or perforated sheet material. The word &quot;sift&quot; derives from &quot;sieve&quot;.

In cooking, a sifter is used to separate and break up clumps in dry ingredients such as flour, as well as to aerate and combine them. A strainer (see colander), meanwhile, is a form of sieve used to separate suspended solids from a liquid by filtration.

==Sieving==
Sieving is a simple technique for separating particles of different sizes. A sieve such as used for sifting flour has very small holes. Coarse particles are separated or broken up by grinding against one another and the screen openings. Depending upon the types of particles to be separated, sieves with different types of holes are used. Sieves are also used to separate stones from sand. Sieving plays an important role in food industries where sieves (often vibrating) are used to prevent the contamination of the product by foreign bodies. The design of the industrial sieve is of primary importance here.

Triage sieving refers to grouping people according to their severity of injury.

==Wooden sieves==
The mesh in a wooden sieve might be made from wood or wicker. Use of wood to avoid contamination is important when the sieve is used for sampling. Henry Stephens, in his &quot;Book of the Farm&quot;, advised that the withes of a wooden riddle or sieve be made from fir or willow with American elm being best. The rims would be made of fir, oak or, especially, beech.

== US standard test sieve series ==

A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used (commonly used in civil engineering or sedimentology) to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material. Sieve sizes used in combinations of four to eight sieves.

==Other types==
* Chinois, or conical sieve used as a strainer, also sometimes used like a food mill
* Cocktail strainer, a bar accessory
* Colander, a (typically) bowl-shaped sieve used as a strainer in cooking
* Flour sifter or bolter, used in flour production and baking 
* Graduated sieves, used to separate varying small sizes of material, often soil, rock or minerals
* Mesh strainer, or just &quot;strainer&quot;, usually consisting of a fine metal mesh screen on a metal frame
** Laundry strainer, to drain boiling water from laundry removed from a wash copper, usually with a wooden frame to facilitate manual handling with hot contents
* Riddle, used for soil
* Spider, used in Chinese cooking
* Tamis, also known as a drum sieve
* Tea strainer, specifically intended for use when making tea
* &quot;Zaru&quot;, or bamboo sieve, used in Japanese cooking
;Other uses
* &quot;Sieve&quot; is a common term used in trash-talk referring to a goaltender in ice hockey who lets in too many goals
* &quot;Leaks like a sieve&quot; is an English language idiom to describe a container that has multiple leaks, or, by allegory, an organization whose confidential information is routinely disclosed to the public.
